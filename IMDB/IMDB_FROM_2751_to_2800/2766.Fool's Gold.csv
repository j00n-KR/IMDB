0,TheLittleSongbird,A mess,2,7 September 2011,"The only reason why I didn't rate Fools Gold any lower is because of the film's setting, which is absolutely gorgeous and photographed beautifully. The soundtrack was yet another instance of being nice to listen to but was forgettable soon after. The story is uneven in pace and predictable in that you know what is coming and how it was going to end. The script is a mess really, there is a severe lack of wit, it all feels heavy-handed and the more romantic moments are very stilted in the flow. I also had difficulty believing that the same director who directed the sublime Ever After: A Cinderella Story also directed this, the direction here is rather phoned in and any touches that were at least nice don't live long in the memory. The acting is not very good, Matthew McCoghauney and Kate Hudson are attractive but have a lack of chemistry between them I feel and neither of them look natural here, while Donald Sutherland was a nice find but he deserved much better. The actors though are disadvantaged by the fact the characters are very stock and irritating in Fools Gold. Overall, a mess and only redeemed by the setting. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Fool's Gold
1,SnoopyStyle,Only laugh when Kate Hudson nails McConaughey with a golf club,4,1 December 2013,"Finn (Matthew McConaughey) is good at three things; underwater treasure hunting, getting money for treasure hunting, and something that got Tess (Kate Hudson) to marry him for. On the latest hunt, he finds an important clue to a Spanish sunken treasure. Only his boat and all his equipment sink. Now he owes a lot of money to Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart). He barely escapes from his thugs trying to kill him. Meanwhile Tess is working on wealthy Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland)'s yacht as a steward. Finn gets on board and convinces everybody to join in the search for the treasure.There're a lot bad things about this movie. First Matthew McConaughey is playing a very annoying shirtless irresponsible jerk. The only funny moment in the movie is when Kate Hudson took a golf club and smacked him over the head. There isn't much funny in this comedy.The story of the treasure is too convoluted, and I don't know why it had to be like that. It took a long time to explain, and it left me scratching my head in the end. It didn't advance the story, or make me laugh. It wasted too much time with a lot of exposition.Kevin Hart plays possibly the most annoying character ever. He's not funny. He's not threatening. It's just tiresome.The movie is working at cross purposes. It tries to be a wacky comedy, and it mostly fails. Then it gets way too serious. Characters actually die in this movie. The action gets scary. As a comedy, it doesn't work. As an adventure, it doesn't work.",Fool's Gold
2,moonspinner55,Appealing stars adrift in witless waters...,3,6 May 2011,"Fortune-hunting American couple off the coast of Veracruz, recently divorced after eight years together, finally discover the whereabouts of that lost-lost Spanish treasure they've been dreaming about--but a comical gangster named Bigg Bunny and his boys may get to it first. Leads Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson both look great in beachwear, however their combined taste in screenplays could use some exercise in judgment. Co-written by director Andy Tennant with John Claflin and Daniel Zelman, from Claflin and Zelman's original treatment, this hopeless plot doesn't kick into second gear until the third act--and even then it's improbable and sloppy. The laughs are nil as manic McConaughey makes eyes at his ex while fending off the bad guys with any object applicable for generating an appropriate blow to the head (it seems everyone here is prone to getting punched, slammed, knocked out and knocked over). Mainly for matinée masochists. *1/2 from ****",Fool's Gold
3,paul_haakonsen,"Predictable, but entertaining...",6,22 December 2015,"While ""Fool's Gold"" is predictable to the point where even a blind can see what's coming, it still proves to be quite entertaining. It is the type of movie that you can't help to enjoy, sort of like a brushed up take on a movie such as ""Romancing the Stone"".There is a good flow to the story and it worked out quite nicely. The movie picks up speed right from the very start and keep on sprinting in that high speed to the very end. And while on the topic of the story, then it is only fair to say that the storyline is fun, good and fast paced.The movie was also quite nicely cast, and there is a great chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. But Donald Sutherland also did add a great, unique touch to the movie, just a shame that he didn't have more time on the screen than he did.""Fool's Gold"" is the type of movie that you can watch more than just once, despite being so predictable.",Fool's Gold
4,ComedyFan2010,Fool's Choice,3,23 February 2014,"I am somebody who liked a romantic comedy from time to time. Just like any other genre it has a few great movies in it. And this one also included adventure, so I thought it will be a great movie then. Unfortunately I was wrong.The movie is incredibly bad. It is boring, predictable, with bad acting and cliché characters.We have Tess, the usual woman who has a stick up her ass and doesn't enjoy fun and wants her husband to ""grow up"". There is Finn, the hot immature guy. The dumb girl who likes to shop. And they are all portrayed with horrible acting that makes it even harder to like them. I keep on seeing Matthew McConaughey always play this guy and always do it horribly, I have no idea why he keeps on getting these roles.The only good thing about the movie is the scenery. Sitting in cold Canada waiting for winter to end I enjoyed watching the sunny Caribbean.",Fool's Gold
5,edwagreen,Fool's Gold- Fools March In **1/2,5,20 August 2008,"Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson provide perfect chemistry in this film.Recently divorced, these divers are pursuing a treasure from old Spain which is supposedly a new queen's dowry. Quite far-fetched to say the least.Donald Sutherland plays an odd bit character. His British accent is a bit too thick for his taste. He has quite an odd ball daughter from a marriage to a 24 year old Nebraskan who dealt cards in Las Vegas. She isn't as stupid as supposedly she is made out to be.McConaughey and Hudson should never have divorced as they're made for each other. Naturally, the film includes those crooks who want the treasures for themselves. The finale with the airplane is action-packed but the entire film leaves a lot to be desired.",Fool's Gold
6,sunwarrior13,Fails In All Level,1,10 March 2014,"Fool's Gold is the second film that teams up Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson after appearing together in How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.In this romantic comedy,the find together playing a divorced couple who rekindle their marriage while searching for a lost treasure.Donald Sutherland and Alexis Dziena co-star.Andy Tennant directs.Well,there is nothing really to say about this movie as it fails on every level.The characters are developed that we simply don't care about them particularly Benjamin and Tess.The audience probably do not care whether they get back together or not.Also,we don't care as well whether they find the treasure or not.We know what's going to happen in the end as it was predictable from beginning to end.Definitely,one may find it too long.What's worse,there isn't any funny moment in it as the gags were practically humorless.Finally,there is nothing really good going for the film except the charm and appeal of McConaughey and Hudson.If you find their first film together bad,you'll probably find this worse.",Fool's Gold
7,hitchcockthelegend,"No gold rush here, more a steady stroll to the treasure.",6,5 January 2012,"Fool's Gold is directed by Andy Tennant who also co-writes with John Claflin and Daniel Zelman. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson, Alexis Dziena, Ewen Bremner, Donald Sutherland and Ray Winstone. Music is scored by George Fenton and cinematography is by Don Burgess.In 1715 a fleet of ships carrying gold from the New World to Spain sank, taking to the bottom of the ocean the wealthy haul that would become known as the Queen's Dowry.........Treasure hunters Benjamin ""Finn"" Finnegan ( McConaughey) and his estranged wife Tess (Hudson) are close to finding it, but naturally others are heavily involved as well.....After getting a savaging from the critics upon its release, and ranking down with the mid section non-entities on internet forums, I approached Fool's Gold with a very low expectation level. Whilst hardly being a great movie, or even a good one to justify its considerable kerching at the box office and DVD tills, it's not exactly an evil stinker either. Yes it has major problems, main one being that as an action adventure it actually lacks much adventure to call it as such, with many scenes just consisting of idle chatter, and the clichés run rife throughout. It's true enough to say as well that it's often unintentionally funny, especially as regards the number of ""iffy"" accents being attempted by Sutherland, Bremner and Winstone, while much of the pratfall comedy doesn't work or do the actors any favours. But the film has a quaint whiff of charm about it, always remaining good natured, even as the fists fly and the blood flows in the finale. It also looks lovely as the makers film in and around some notable Australian locations. And for those inclined towards human eye candy, McConaughey, Hudson and Dziena show the flesh.Instantly forgettable once its over, but pleasant enough as an undemanding time filler. 6/10",Fool's Gold
8,CinemaSerf,Passes the time...,6,16 April 2020,"Realistically, this film will only work if you like predictable pointless adventure movies that feature Matthew McConaughey showing off his finely honed torso as often as he may. We join the story of his rather chaotic life as his wife manages to screw him for everything in a divorce. He then proceeds to team up with her - and millionaire Donald Sutherland (and his immensely irritating daughter Alexis Dziena) to track down a massive dowry of Spanish treasure that was sunk in a hurricane around the time of the Spanish Armada. It's got plenty of lovely scenery, luxury yachts and even some local gangsters with bling - but otherwise is a forgettable treasure hunt that, whilst certainly not awful, is pretty much along the lines of his 2005 ""Sahara"" escapade.",Fool's Gold
9,zardoz-13,"""Fool's Gold"" is all glitter and no grit.",5,14 February 2008,"The amusing antics of ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" co-stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson brighten up ""Hitch"" director Andy Tennant's largely comic, rarely credible, and ultimately predictable romantic action comedy ""Fool's Gold,"" with Donald Sutherland, Alex Dizena, and Ray Winstone. This atmospheric but anemic 112-minute, PG-13 rated, treasure hunting yarn contains trace elements of originality, credibility, and suspense. Indeed, Matthew and Kate make a thoroughly believable couple, and their repartee almost compensates for the hackneyed action half of the plot that has been done to death. Tennant imitates entire action scenes from earlier films. For example, the flying boat sequence that has McConaughey scrambling onto one of the pontoons, riding it into the clouds, and then taking charge of the aircraft in the air from the pilot appeared in the 1989 James Bond opus ""Licensed to Kill."" The first scene in ""Fool's Gold"" is the funniest and sets the tone for this disposable escapade. Ben Finnegan (Mathew McConaughey of ""U-571"") and his buddy Alfonz (Ewen Bremner of ""Trainspotting"") are scouring the ocean floor for treasure with the equivalent of an underwater leaf blower. Above them, aboard their untended ship, a faulty air compressor ignites a piece of paper that floats into the wheel house and creates a fire. While our oblivious heroes rummage around the ocean floor, their ship explodes and sinks behind them in a huge cloud. Ironically, when the vessel hits bottom, the impact dislodges a plate shard buried in the sand. Ben catches the shard and recognizes the plate was part of the fabled cargo of a Spanish treasure ship that sank in a hurricane back in 1715 on its way to Spain. Only after Ben and Alfonz surface and look around do they realize that their ship has settled at the bottom of Davy Jones' locker. Meanwhile, island gangster Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart of ""Soul Plane""), who cuddles a rabbit, orders his henchmen to kill Ben. Bigg believes Ben sabotaged his own ship. Further, Bigg wants Ben dead because Ben owes Bigg over $62-thousand dollars. Bigg's henchmen haul Ben off for a date with an anchor and the briny blue depths. At the same time, Ben's feisty wife Tess Finnegan (Kate Hudson of ""Almost Famous"") is divorcing Ben, so that she can secure a loan and return to school. After the divorce, she learns that she no longer owns a boat and decks Ben with a walking stick. Tess takes a steward job aboard a luxurious yacht owned by multi-millionaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland of ""M.A.S.H."") and freaks out when Ben shows up to ask Nigel to fund his treasure hunt. Bigg hires rival treasure hunter Mo Fitch (Roy Winstone of ""Beowulf"") to beat Ben to the Spanish treasure. Nigel's jet-setting daughter Gemma (Alex Dizena of ""Havoc"") flies in to sponge off her father and show her ignorance. Sutherland is hilarious as a wealthy British subject and his performance and ersatz accent brings to mind the late great Ronald Colman. Matthew McConaughey is hopelessly virile and Kate Hudson is as wacky as the late Lucille Ball.The adventure part of ""Fool's Gold"" runs aground because of its clownish villains. A troop of girl scouts could whip the African-American bad guys here. Not only are they are terrible pistol shots, but for all of their notoriety they also pose little challenge to Matt and Kate. Unfortunately, Tennant and co-writers John Claflin and Daniel Zelman cannibalize three infinitely better movies, namely ""Into The Blue"" (2005), ""The Deep"" (1977), and ""Underwater!"" (1955), for their treasure salvage plot. All these movies used the sunken, buried, or hidden Spanish treasure routine with greater success. Although much of this movie takes place at sea, you won't see a shark in sight and sometimes you don't even see any fish. What's worse, ""Fool's Gold"" roughly resembles the more straightforward McConaughey movie ""Sahara"" (2005) about Civil War treasure hunters. Unlike the goofy romantic action comedy that ""Fool's Gold"" qualifies as, everybody in ""Sahara"" played things straight. Ostensibly, like pyrite, ""Fool's Gold"" is all glitter and no grit.",Fool's Gold
10,view_and_review,I was the Fool,2,25 October 2021,"After fifty minutes of not laughing I decided I didn't need another hour of the same. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey repeatedly fail in this comedy adventure about finding treasure, and, maybe maybe maybe, rediscovering the ""love"" they once had (which based upon all evidence was more like sex). It seems that Tess (Kate Hudson), in all her brilliance, threw her life away on spring break because the sex was so amazing. So amazing that it was a run-on joke that never got any funnier. Unfortunately, Kevin Hart, through no fault of his own, did nothing to enhance the movie's comedic value. And the movie only got worse when Donald Sutherland's stereotypical, dumb, rich daughter joined the fray.Looks like the only fool was me for giving 50 minutes of my life to this drivel.",Fool's Gold
11,neil-476,Cheery comedy adventure,7,28 October 2012,"Bickering divorced treasure-hunting couple Finn (Matthew McConaughey) and Tess (Kate Hudson) continue pursuing their previously abandoned attempt to find sunken treasure with the help of millionaire Nigel Hunnicutt (Donald Sutherland) and his idiot daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena), despite the fact that Moe Fitch (Ray Winstone) and Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) have their own thoughts on the matter.The comedy here isn't that funny (although I did find airhead Gemma amusing), and the bickering between Finn and Tess wears out its welcome quickly. And Donald Sutherland's English accent convinces as much as Ray Winstone's American one ie. not at all.But the story is OK, the scenery is attractive, there is minimal swearing - in short, this is an adequate if undemanding way to spend a couple of hours.",Fool's Gold
12,Wuchakk,"Fun island thriller, but a little too long",6,24 October 2011,"Released in 2008, ""Fool's Gold"" stars Matthew McConaughey & Kate Hudson as a couple on the verge of divorce in the Bahamas, the former a treasure-seeker. Donald Sutherland plays Hudson's new rich boss and Alexis Dziena his bimbo-ish daughter. Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart also factor in as potential villains.If you can imagine serious island-thrillers like ""The Deep"" and the two ""Into the Blue"" flicks mixed with a heavy dose of comedy and cartoonish action you'd have a good idea of ""Fool's Gold."" It's basically ""The Goonies"" as adults in the Bahamas.Kate and McConaughey look great and are great together, and everyone else is likable, even the villains (sort of). The problem is the movie is too long at 1 hour, 52 minutes. A silly, fun film like should limit the runtime to around 85-100 minutes.The story takes place in (or near) the Bahamas, but the film was shot on the east coast of Queensland, and you can tell. The coast of Queensland is gorgeous but it lacks the lushness of the Caribbean. Regardless, the film is worth watching just for the locations, especially on a cloudy fall day or a cold winter night.So this is a fun island flick with romance, treasure-hunting and adventure, but it's a little too long for such goofy antics. For the real deal in oceanic thrillers check out 2009's ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef,"" which IMHO is way better than the original ""Into the Blue"" from 2005.GRADE: B-/C+",Fool's Gold
13,mm-39,Good solid movie,7,5 March 2008,"Living in the cold March weather of Winnipeg, Canada I found the sun and surf a relaxing break from the cold weather where the wind chill freezes my bones until July. A good solid movie. Great cast Hudson, Sutherland, and Matt. The actors can bring the best out of a script with their facial expressions, and mannerisms. Sutherland is like wine and gets better with age. A natural actor. The script is a good mix of humor, and action. The rapper sub-plot is added comic relief and action. The lighting and location shots bring out a feeling of adventure. The wide open spaces created by the camera angles give a feeling of freedom. All I can say is please take me away from this cold weather I want to be there in Florida. 7 start out of 10. Great to get rid of those winter blues.",Fool's Gold
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Fool's Gold,5,24 February 2008,"Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson paired up in a chick flick some 5 years back in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, with the latter making the former fall in love with her, and then having to shrug him off as part of a social experiment, only to find herself really loving him instead. In Fool's Gold, our couple reunites, with Kate Hudson's Tess going down deja-vu avenue in wanting to divorce husband Finn, played by McConaughey because she just had enough of his lack of keeping to promises, which even a fantastic sex life couldn't help.It's no surprise that movies such as Fool's Gold continue to be made, and the formula is pretty no brainer as well. Put in some tempting opportunity for prospecting sunken treasure in the depths of the seas from some aged old ship, smack together good looking leads (so that they can get away with everything, including a bad story) who don't mind bearing their bodies in trunks of bikinis for the most parts of the movie, and pour in plenty of water, jokes, and goon type characters as baddies.Finn, as a hero, is almost always bumming through life, and making the wrong deals with the wrong kinds of persons. His latest expedition, while managing to gain small results, offends his financier Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart), who's after his hide for making him lose money. His soon to be ex-wife works as a stewart onboard the luxury yacht of multi-millionaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland), who soon finds himself charmed by the couple's enthusiasm and passion for treasure hunting, and backs them in their latest quest to locate the lost treasure known as the Queen's Dowry, where 40 chests of jewellery with emeralds and rubies the size of a human fists. And the quest is not made easy when there's competition in the form of Moe Fitch (Ray Winstone without CGI to buff him up to Beowulf proportions), and Big Bunny's goons with an injection of foreign talent.For some parts, this looked like National Treasure without the location jet-setting and the cryptic clues. There's a hidden treasure somewhere that our heroes have to dig deep from clues provided from the past, in knowing characters, their histories and motivations, and of course with goons constantly hot on their heels doing things the easier way without working the brains. However, Fool's Gold had loaded itself with too many characters in its ensemble, and as it expectedly turns out, everyone else besides Hudson and McConaughey are in supporting, one dimensional caricatures.You have a rapper and his posse, a pair of gay chefs, rival treasure plunders with history going way back, and a tycoon and his daughter whom he's trying to connect with. If I should choose my favourite character amongst all of them, it's gotta be that bimbotic heiress (Alexis Dziena) probably cloned from Paris Hilton's genes. In fact, some of her lines are so genuinely stupid, that they somehow turn out really hilarious, and the delivery by that wide-eyed ingénue, clueless face, gave those lame jokes an added boost.Standard action adventure fare with predictable outcome. Don't go into this movie expecting anything more, or you'll be making a foolish choice.",Fool's Gold
15,JamesHitchcock,"There is nothing deep and significant about this film, but why should there be?",6,19 August 2015,"Like ""Underwater"" from the fifties and ""The Deep"" from the seventies, ""Fool's Gold"" is a film about diving for lost treasure in the Caribbean. At least, it's supposed to be the Caribbean, although most of the shooting actually took place (for climatic rather than financial reasons) in Australia. One detail apparently borrowed from ""The Deep"" is that the heroes are searching for the ""dowry"" of King Philip V of Spain, supposedly lost off the Bahamas in 1715. (Actually, a ""dowry"" is a payment made by the bride's family to the groom, not vice versa).The film also combines elements of a genre which was popular in the thirties and forties and which has occasionally been revived in recent years, the ""comedy of remarriage"". The main characters are Benjamin ""Finn"" Finnegan, a professional treasure hunter, and his ex-wife, Tess. The two are thrown together by chance during Finn's search for the wrecked Spanish galleon ""Aurelia""; Tess is working as a steward on a yacht owned by Finn's millionaire patron Nigel Honeycutt. And, of course, they find their love for one another being rekindled in the course of the action. This being a thriller as well as a romance, there have to be other people in search of the treasure, and these include a local gangster named Bigg Bunny. (Not, I would have thought, the most frightening alias that a ruthless villain could have chosen). Another detail borrowed from ""The Deep"" is that the heroes are all white whereas the villains are mostly black. When I re-watched ""The Deep"" recently I assumed that this sort of thing was just an example of 1970s political incorrectness, but it seems that you can still get away with it in the 21st century.The critics' comments ranged from ""an indifferent mess"" to ""a cheesy, familiar bore"" via ""excruciatingly lame"" and ""stupid, slack and sexless"". Male critics in particular seemed to object to the fact that Matthew McConaughey spends much of the running-time shirtless and bare- chested. Kate Hudson even ended up with a ""Worst Actress"" Razzie nomination. And yet I was unable to join in this near-unanimous chorus of disapproval; not for the first time I found myself warming to a film which the critics generally hated. Yes, there are things wrong with it. Hudson will never have quite the same charisma as her famous mother Goldie Hawn. The cliff-hanging (or should that be plane-hanging) finale was a direct plagiarism from at least two Bond movies, except that in the Bond movies it was done better. Donald Sutherland tends to overact and plays Honeycutt with the sort of fruity upper-class British accent that the British upper classes generally abandoned circa 1960. (The Canadian Sutherland was presumably cast on the basis of the common American view that, as Canada is still part of the Queen's dominions, all Canadians must therefore speak the Queen's English with a British accent). I felt, however, that the critics who disparaged the film so much were taking it too seriously. It is not a comedy in the sense of a film which regales us with one hilarious joke after another, but it is generally light-hearted and does not take itself too seriously. (In this it is very different to ""The Deep"", which took itself far too seriously). The photography of the tropical scenery is attractive- another way in which it scores over ""The Deep"", where the scenes shot on land seemed just as dull and murky as those shot deep under the ocean. McConaughey and Hudson were never going to win any Oscars, but they make an likable couple, and there is an amusing contribution from Alexis Dziena as Honeycutt's airheaded daughter Gemma. There is nothing deep and significant about this film, but why should there be? There is, after all, a place in the cinema for films which simply seek to entertain rather than to make a profound statement about life, and entertaining is something which ""Fool's Gold"" does rather well. 6/10",Fool's Gold
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Everyone keeps bashing the guys who directed Meet the Spartans and such, what about Andy Tennant?",2,28 February 2008,"Oh, romantic comedies, I don't know why, but it seems like everyone is just being fooled into thinking these movies are original and funny. When I saw trailer for Fool's Gold, the first thing I thought was ""Lemme sum up the movie for you..."" and I did for my friends, they think I'm horrible for it, but I was right, everything that I said came true when I saw this movie. The reason why I saw it was because I got to see it for free and figured, just go ahead and give the movie a chance, sometimes I am a little too harsh on these films. So I went in with an open mind, nope, I was right, while this film was A LITTLE better than what I expected, it still was true to what I thought it was going to be. I was so blinded by everyone's tans, it was a bit insane, not to mention the horrible performances as well as cliché's.Ben and Tess are divorced, Tess is fed up with her husband spending all his time trying to find a treasure they've been searching for for years. But Ben is still very much in love with Tess and begs her to go for one last adventure with him, they go together with the help of Tess's boss, Nigel Honeycutt and his bimbo daughter, Gemma, to find the treasure. But of course there is always a villain who wants the treasure for evil purposes.The cliché's, Gemma, Tess's boss's daughter, she's a bimbo who acts like a total moron but is beautiful and sweet, blah blah blah and regains her friendship with her estranged dad. Ben and Tess, realistically, would they get back together? Let's say yes, but they'll be divorced again in a couple months. The script was horrible and the story just wasn't presented well and the actors were all wrong, I wouldn't recommend this film at all. Everyone is complaining about the Meet the Spartans directors and that those movies are ""dumbing"" down society, what about these lousy romantic comedies? Please, these movies are over done and are so over.2/10",Fool's Gold
17,OllieSuave-007,A pretty fun treasure hunt flick.,7,9 June 2014,"This is a pretty fun treasure flick starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson as an estranged couple who is trying to rekindle their marriage while they both go on a lost treasure hunt in the Bahamas.It's not a spectacular movie as it has its corny moments, some cheesy dialog and some plot points that dragged the film somewhat, but overall, it does have some fun adventures and exciting good guy vs. bad guy elements. It's a romantic comedy with touches of action and thrills mixed in; therefore, what you get is a pretty good combo of both genres - romance and adventure.McConaughey and Hudson had great chemistry and it was funny watching them, as a divorced couple, quarrel and getting frustrated with each other as they attempt to find this treasure.Again, the film is not a masterpiece, but a pretty fun film nonetheless.Grade B-",Fool's Gold
18,Buddy-51,dreadful on every level,3,29 March 2009,"The appropriately titled ""Fool's Gold"" is a lame, thoroughly hopeless romantic comedy whose sole purpose for existence is to allow us to watch a couple of impossibly beautiful people (Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson) romping around in an impossibly beautiful setting (the Caribbean Sea).McConaughey, in another of his increasingly frivolous roles (there was a time when he seemed to have an ambition to be an actual actor), plays a down-on-his-luck treasure salvager who believes he's uncovered the whereabouts of a vast fortune - the Queen of Spain's dowry to be exact - that was lost in a shipwreck off the coast of Florida in the early 1700s. Hudson plays his long-suffering wife who fancies herself an intellectual and therefore has filed for divorce from a man who is all brawn and no brains and who is always off chasing rainbows when he should be at home with the woman he loves.To say that ""Fool's Gold"" lands on the screen with a resounding thud would be to minimize its awfulness. McConaughey and Hudson, both highly attractive performers under other circumstances, are here reduced to flailing around like mad and mugging for the camera just to cover up for the fact that there is not a single clever or witty line in a screenplay that takes a full one-hour-and-fifty-two minutes to play itself out - a screenplay, incidentally, in which every single black character is either a rap star, an armed-to-the-teeth cutthroat or both (the gays don't fare much better, come to think of it, as they're all portrayed as ninnies and cowards). In supporting roles, Donald Sutherland and Malcolm-Jamal Warner also wind up getting trapped in the wreckage.Unfortunately, for all those involved in ""Fool's Gold,"" the boats aren't the only things sinking in this film.",Fool's Gold
19,MLDinTN,great movie only if you like tropical islands and crystal clear blue water,7,28 February 2009,"I happen to love islands and the turquoise color water, so I found this movie entertaining. The story isn't that good. It's just like that movie that came out with Jessica Alba, Into the Blue, except there are no sharks in this film. This movie also tried to be funny, but really didn't succeed. Part of the problem was Matt McConaughey and Kate Hudson just didn't seem like they would mesh together. He's wild and care free in this and her character is book smart more uptight.Tess has just divorced Ben; however, Ben has just found a plate that was from a treasure they have been looking for. Somoeone tells him that mega millionaire, Nigel Honeycutt's boat is anchored in the harbor, so Ben decides he'll try to convince him to fund his search for the treasure. What he doesn't know is Tess works as a steward on his boat. Some irony. Ben saves Gemma's hat, Nigel's daughter, and she is all for helping him out. Soon they go to a group of islands owned by a rapper, named big bunny, whom is also known to kill people. Ben also owes him over $60000 and happens to be one of those he tried to kill. Bunny has hired a guy of his own to look for the treasure. Now it's a race as to who can find it first.Of course, you know Ben and Tess will have to work together to solve the mystery and will fall in love again. Gemma's crush on Ben is short lived. Ben's diving partner is her love interest. And along the way, we get to see some beautiful scenery of the clear ocean water and island landscapes.FINAL VERDICT: Not that good of a story, I recommend it only if you are like me and just love tropical islands and the clear ocean water.",Fool's Gold

21,lesleyharris30,"Not a Funny or Fun Adventure,",3,18 July 2015,"Fool's Gold is an awful movie with a very poorly written storyline and a really mediocre cast.

The cast of the film either didn't seem to have any interest or had too much, Matthew McConaughey looked like he was having so much fun that he forgot he had to act, Kate Hudson looked like she couldn't wait to be finished work, everyone else just said their lines, the only performance that was noteworthy was Donald Sutherland, it's the type of movie that would mostly work when there's good chemistry between its ensemble cast, and that wasn't evident at all here. Another major problem with this movie is that it simply wasn't funny, it was more interested in being a comedy rather than an adventure, and they didn't deliver one bit, some of the lines could have worked out in some way if they had been delivered better, but for the most part the jokes are straight up lame, I didn't laugh once. Fool's Golds fails as a romance, a comedy and as an adventure, there is no heart there, no chemistry, it just dosen't work, and because of this I couldn't possibly recommend it. An estranged husband and wife reunite to search for a potentially massive haul of treasure. Best Performance: Donald Sutherland Worst Performance: Alexis Dziena",Fool's Gold

23,tabuno,An Entertaining And Almost Refreshingly Great Romantic Comedy,7,21 January 2019,"10 February 2008. Fool's Gold starts out great, amazingly so and then unfortunately turns more into the traditional romantic comedy action thriller by the end of the movie. Overall, the movie had a great send off and then attempts to glide home on its original power but runs out of creative gas and lands with a number of splashes but no amazingly, spectacular ending. This was a very difficult movie because Fool's Gold really is a step into the past without the extra thrills of current movies and relies mostly on quality acting and a fresh approach to comedy which the first half of this movie actually manages to do quite successfully. Kate Hudson is brilliant in the beginning. Even the Donald Sutherland's character with a on screen grand-daughter relationship moves in ways quite unusual for this genre - unfortunately this subdrama was developed and then thrown away. Commendably, this romantic comedy attempts to be a simple, performance-based, script-based comedy but has no safety net fall back on like most other spectacular big movies. This risky decision, left this movie open to the weaknesses of the character driven, script overtaken by the action and fairly simple building climax, shorn the fireworks the audiences have come to expect.

24,johnnyboyz,"Like the 1715 Spanish fleet included in the narrative, the film sinks without a trace not too far into its cast off.",3,25 October 2008,"Good lord, what have we all done wrong to deserve Fool's Gold? This is the sort of film you feel angry you just happened to stumble upon after viewing it; it's the sort of film that bemuses and saddens more than it entertains and enthrals; it's the sort of film that conforms to clichés and strings of bad scenes and yet wants us to think that it's coming across as quite funny, as quite good or heaven help us, quite original. Fool's Gold leaves you saddened and angry in more ways than one. Similarly to Pierce Brosnan's 2004 stinker After the Sunset, Fool's Gold is a film that strings together a couple of big acting names and transports them all out to a tropical location for a few weeks shooting. Hell, why not slack off a while and make it a few months? We are in the tropics, after all.You see, Fool's Gold has that uncanny and infuriating ability to make itself come across as the sort of film with two fingers constantly up at the audience and this is got across through the acting combined with the visuals. Ray Winstone's accent really slips towards the end, but does the director order another take? Of course not, it's a few weeks in the tropics and we're all having fun. Donald Sutherland spends most of the film looking bemused and out of it, but does any one notice this? Does anyone care? Of course not because it's a few weeks in the tropics and we're all having fun. Do we really need big, bulky, bald, mean talking stereotyped bad-guys and incompetent black characters to boot? Of course not, but we're in the tropics and........well, you know the rest.But the worst thing about Fool's Gold; the one thing that actually offends you more than it annoys or angers you is its study of the female. Being a film directed by a man; set in a sunny, warm climate and shot for a certificate that will allow people of most ages to see it, you would expect a fair share of bikini clad women and a topless lead in Matthew McConaughey for the girls. These things are a given and complaining about them is correct slightly more than it is pointless. But what's really bad is its individual study of the lead female, Tess Finnegan, played by Kate Hudson. As a character, she begins as an independent female woman; completely anti McConaughey's character and his bumbling antics. She is a woman on the verge of divorce; on the verge of seeing the light and realising how daft she was in going on a 'spring break' and being stupid enough to fall for this idiot.Tess in the office at the beginning is one of the rare instances in which a woman in the film is actually wearing something. But something bites back and in a horrible turn of form, despite the encouragement of being your own person; your own woman and despite the demonisation of being seduced by spring break and the treasure searching jocks that come with it, something really does go belly up. By the end, Tess has gone on the adventure and has been re-seduced by the treasure searching lark with her idiot, liability husband who has then forced Tess to be re-relegated to what she was before; a bikini clad bimbo who has since shelved any thought of going to university and becoming her own person like she wanted to do in the divorce office.Now comparing Tess at the start to Tess at the end shows she has learnt nothing about her phoney romance from before but that's one thing the film completely tanks out on and is a point that runs throughout the film. More immediate matters just include things in general. A real Spanish shipwreck sunk in 1715 after sailing from Cuba and McConaughey's Benjamin Finnegan, complete with friends later on, takes it upon himself to find this treasure. He does not go on a quest here, nobody does, it's just a series of pratfalls that pause for a daft action sequence involving a bunch of baddie black guys who pop up now and again for antagonism's sake. One such scene has Benjamin underwater and a charge goes off. He flies up into the air and lands on a boat, something that should really have killed him or at least have broken something however later on, an enemy gets pushed up a blowhole and instead of landing on the rocks, unbroken he actually gets decapitated on the way up. By this point realism and internal logic have completely dissipated.But it's other things that really annoy. The character of Gemma (Dziena), Nigel Honeycutt's (Sutherland) daughter, is so cringe-worthingly awful that even the characters look bemused and surprised at her idiocy, but I ask why include her in the first place? For cheap laughs? Does the writer not think the rest of the film is as bad and brainless that it won't be enough for the teenagers in the crowd anyway? Her one highlight is shortly after Benjamin is blown out of the water by the charge and a sword lands point down on the boat where she is sitting, legs apart and bikini covered crotch in full view. The phallic cutlass jabs into the boat in-between her legs and she lets out a yell in surprise that mid-yell turns to pleasure as we realise the impended meaning, especially since it followed a scene during which she had to act provocatively to distract rival sailors. Fool's Gold is a really bad effort and quite daft. I will be saddened if I see a worse film from 2008.",Fool's Gold
25,Anonymous_Maxine,Just looking around the plane was more interesting,3,18 June 2008,"Recently I have been studying a lot about ancient Chinese history, particularly their astonishing oceanic achievements in the early 15th century, when their great ocean fleets sailed around the world's ocean's and charted the entire planet decades and centuries before the great European explorers. In doing that they have left 600-year-old shipwrecks all over the world, many of which have yet to be discovered. The subject is endlessly fascinating to me, so I was hoping a story about a Spanish galleon sunk in 1715 (which I caught on a flight from Shanghai to Chicago last week) would be more entertaining, but unfortunately this little adventure is badly dumbed down by trying to cater to the lowest common denominator.Matthew McConaughey (who probably has the most difficult name to spell in all of Hollywood) has certainly done worse films, but unfortunately the only one that pops into my mind at the moment is Texas Chainsaw III, which has to be one of the worst and most tasteless films ever made, even for a chainsaw film. I have never been a big fan of Kate Hudson, ever since I was disappointed by the hugely overrated Almost Famous, but interestingly enough, she and McConaughey have chemistry enough here, it's just too bad that it's so obvious that the director has them running around half naked for the majority of the movie. Have to keep the audience interested somehow, and since the story isn't going to do itMcConaughey and Hudson play Tess and Finn, a married couple whose marriage is long since broken or about to be broken or something. It doesn't matter, they are still madly in love with each other, they just need a sunken treasure adventure and a captive audience to bring them back together again. Finn is sure that he has found the location of the wreck of the ancient treasure ship, but has to convince Tess and the super-rich Nigel (a bored Donald Sutherland) that he's right, which is no easy task, given his history as more than a bit of a loser.As a group of rival treasure hunters closes in on the treasure ship at the same time, you have your routine, by-the-numbers movie treasure hunt, and your eyes can safely glaze over for much of the rest of the movie. Incidentally, Nigel has a daughter, Gemma. This is obviously the most outrageously pointless and idiotic role in the entire movie. Her job seems to be to pop up every once in a while wearing a tiny bikini and making another idiot remark. This girl doesn't have a thought in her head and looks like she's 13 years old. She is a pedophile's dream, and I can not for the life of me imagine why she would be put in this movie. What a waste.The last portion of the movie is composed of a bizarre climax, a series of descents into a real rock formation in southern California that shoots water up into the air like a cannon. When I used to go there in high school we called it the ""toilet bowl,"" but no one I know was ever brave or dumb enough to jump into it. (spoilers) For the purpose of the movie, there is a shipwreck that has manages to wriggle its way underneath the rocks, and now sits at the base of the toilet bowl, needing only a little jiggle from our heroine (after having been tossed in by the bad guys) to unleash a shower of gold every time a wave comes through. Right.This is the kind of nonsense that we get in the conclusion of an already disappointing movie, and believe it or not, it gets even dumber. Lately there seems to have been a nonstop onslaught of treasure hunt movies, no doubt started or at least boosted by National Treasure, which was also disappointing but at least entertaining, as was The Da Vinci Code. Fool's Gold, on the other hand, is just a little too self-descriptive.",Fool's Gold
26,FiendishDramaturgy,"Does not live up to its potential, but is still entertaining.",7,21 February 2009,"Awesome story, intriguing plot, and excellent portrayals mark this work as superior to its ratings. Actually it is quite fun, shows at least a margin of cleverness, and a high level of entertainment. The premise is adventurous and intelligent, and the overall work is highly enjoyable. Performances are on par with what is expected, and the overall execution is quirky and fun.This plays almost like an adult version The Goonies. It is eccentric and at times impossible, yet manages to retain some level of believability in spite of itself. Regardless of the violent aspects peppered throughout this work actually comes off sweetly as a black comedy with a rich story and beautiful execution. This was a pleasant surprise all the way around and I am immensely happy to have seen it.All in all? This is a couples movie. It holds enough skin and action to mildly satisfy the man's man, yet carries enough of the romantic comedy to keep the gals happy.

Had it been made in the 1990s it would have been a modest success...But it was made in 2008 and the tastes of the world had changed. 9-11 had come and gone and people lost that childlike innocence that is needed to enjoy films like this. The Computer Age dawned and everyone wanted nothing but over-the-top special effects.So fun adventures were shoved to the side and the critics--that still claim to love fun adventures like Captain Blood--turned their noses up at anyone that even hinted towards enjoying them.What you have is a treasure standing in for the MacGuffin, a roguish hero, a little bit of a love triangle, and the open seas.It is classic Hollywood. It is also, unfortunately, they kind of movie we need today and the kind that Hollywood is most reluctant to make.",Fool's Gold

Matthew McConaghey and Kate Hudson are a newly divorced couple who learn that a treasure they've been after is off the coast of Key West (thanks to Mr. Mac), and they take a cruise ship to go get it. My favorite scenes are the divorce scene, the diving scenes, and the scenes with the rich, air-headed rich girl. McConaghey is heavily in debt to a murderous rap star, which is why he is after the treasure. After a slow start, this really picks up and turns into a decent movie with gorgeous settings and lovely underwater photography and good cast chemistry. I loved it.*** out of ****",Fool's Gold
29,barnabyrudge,Heavy-handed comic adventure.,3,29 December 2009,"Fool's Gold is marketed as a romantic comedy, but is in fact an action movie with bits of comedy and romance sprinkled in. It's also a largely terrible film with absurd scenes, predictable plotting, hopeless dialogue and idiotic characters. At least the locations are pretty. It's not hard to imagine why the actors agreed to do it – a few weeks in these sun-soaked locales would be tough for anyone to turn down. But as an exercise in film-making or an attempt to provide viewers with some amusing entertainment, this simply doesn't deliver.Ben ""Finn"" Finnegan (Matthew McConaughey) is a fairly dumb, chilled-out treasure hunter whose relationship with wife Tess (Kate Hudson) has crumbled apart. Finn once inspired Tess with his dream of locating a fabled treasure in the Bahamas; now she's had enough of his unfulfilled promises and just wants to go back to Chicago to get on with her life. Just as their divorce takes effect, though, Finn has a lucky breakthrough when he and his eccentric Ukranian buddy Alfonz (Ewen Bremner) discover a piece of plate which is part of the treasure they are seeking. Against her better judgement, Tess joins him once more to track down the elusive treasure. But they face rivalry in their quest for it, as super-rich rapper Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) – who has old scores to settle with Finn - owns the island where the loot may be hidden. Aided by multi-millionaire yacht-owner Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland), and his ditsy daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena), the Finnegans race against time to be first to the treasure.Fool's Gold is a film which embarrasses its cast. McConaughey's character makes no sense, portrayed as dumb and goofy one moment, and resourceful and heroic the next. Hudson is simply annoying, but not nearly as annoying as Dziena as the most irritating and stupid female character of 2008! Donald Sutherland maintains a little dignity as the wealthy entrepreneur, but it's a half-baked character which could in truth have been played by any half-decent actor. There's not much to get excited about in the story – it's all been done many times before, and there's nothing fresh or original about this one to raise it above the rest. The plot developments are telegraphed way too far in advance and all the fun is sucked out of the scenes and situations by an overall air of heavy-handedness.",Fool's Gold
30,Enchorde,A treasure in itself,8,11 October 2008,"Recap: For Finnegan it's all about the treasure. And it is the Treasure, with a big T. A legendary great treasure, meant to be the Queens Dowry in her marriage to the Spanish King. So an unfathomable amount of treasure was loaded on the galleons in Vera Cruz, and sent on their way. But they were never seen again. But Finnegan thinks he knows where at least one ended up. Unfortunately, as good as he is at treasure hunting, he is dreadful at most other aspects of life. So, he finds himself clinging on for his life, drifting at sea, after a investor tried to kill him. And he's late for his divorce.Comments: Doesn't everybody, at least sometimes, dream of escaping the everyday life, head south towards sun and sea and go treasure hunting? At least I do. And therefore it is not hard to see why I instantly like this movie, and agrees so well with Finnegan. He is living his (my?) dream and if he hasn't achieved monetary success he at least got a great wife. Sorry, make that ex-wife.Fool's Gold delivers exactly what it promises. Apart from gold, it delivers a good entertaining two hours. It is care free, humor filled adventure. And it invites you to tag along! McConaughey (Finnegan) is great as the treasure hunting beach bum. He got that crooked smile, that carefree passion for life and adventure. The dreamer. He is extremely likable and easy to identify with. And then there is Tess, played by Hudson. The realist, the anchor to reality. But not without a flair for adventure and dreams too. Hudson has no problem depicting that.And as usual in these movies there are a string of supporting cast, each character filling their own niche. Too many to mention, but they're doing their job gallantly.So we got an adventure, we got a likable cast of characters chasing a dream. We get action and humor, and a little piece of romance.

31,Kingslaay,I want that lost time back,6,10 May 2020,Despite the decent cast Fool's gold falls flat on its face. It interests you with its story of treasure and the love hate relationships. The number of crazy parties hunting for it could have been an explosive collision but it was the opposite. A weak and poorly constructed film.

That's how I feel about Fool's Gold I'm not too big a fan of Kate Hudson, I liked her in Almost Famous, but everything else has been pretty lackluster for me. She wasn't even the best thing to look at in this one, that goes to Broken Flowers cutie Alexis Dziena, who does nothing but complain and wear barely there bikinis. So I can't complain.The story, if I can remember it correctly, involves a married couple, who get a divorce and end up on the same boat going after buried treasure. The film has no real tension and tries desperately to put their characters in situations that beg the audience to care. Opps...Pretty boy McConaughey goes around with no shirt on and smiles and laughs and kisses the girl. More of the same from others films he's been in. He's a summer blockbuster actor that draws in the women, yet he's still a likable guy. I'm waiting for him to want to take on some meatier roles.Nothing new here, the film might actually depress you because of how beautiful the locations are and the good looking rich people get to go their, while you're still stuck at home in the dark eating that buttery popcorn.",Fool's Gold

I feel bad for enjoying this film too. The point still remain, I enjoyed the film.Well, I must say, the marketing in here is way off. It was marketed like a sequel to ""How to Lost a Guy in 10 Days"" and we know that if you reunite two stars from a successful movie, this will make money too. Well, at least it paid off from the distributors.When I saw the film, I expected something like ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" Well, it was trying to be like that for the first 40 minutes into the film and failed miserably to make us laugh. However, I tend to laugh at the more ""stupid"" jokes in here because it was basically stupid comments from the stupid characters which, to me, I found funny.After the 40 minute range, it could've been a ""National Treasure"" sequel and/or a ""Sahara"" sequel from there, in a much less scale, of course. This is what the marketing didn't tell us. Right from the start, I was surprised the movie was a little too violent as a light-hearted comedy.Well, I would be surprised throughout the film seeing some blood here and there and some action scenes. I see this is what you'll get when you take a romantic comedy film and mix it with an action adventure. The romantic comedy didn't work too well but I found the action adventure a bit more entertaining and tolerable, which is the reason I liked the movie.Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, again, have the good chemistry. Supporting roles were a bit off, especially seeing Donald Sutherland in this type of movie. Alexis Dziena is probably the one I would like to give hats off to to actually giving us some decent laughs in the movie.Go in expecting an action adventure movie rather than a romantic comedy the marketing was aiming for.

Did anyone say 'watchable'?I will say the acting by all was consistently good. I thought that Mr. McConaughy would overact, as he can do at times, but all in all, he did good. A breath of fresh air was Elexis Dziena who played Gemma. She reminded me of a young and perky Sally Fields. And, Donald Sutherland as Nigel Honeycutt was perfect as the rich guy and his relationship with daughter Gemma was touching and those scenes were pure gold and for my money the best parts of the movie. Those were the scenes that kept me watching a 'watchable' movie. Pure gold.I didn't understand the title though. There was a treasure, and it was found.

Really long. One of those days where your body feels like a freight train ran it over and your brain's a bowl of oatmeal. You've probably had those days. You just want to come home, unwind, sip a cool one, and sit back in a mindless haze for a while. Ahh! Normally I like films that are bit more visceral and cerebral. But not this day. My mind needed the minimal amount of energy expended in order to ingest something, and Fool's Gold met that need.Yes, we certainly get to see Matthew McConaughey (TROPIC THUNDER) without his shirt on more times than you can shake a stick at. And Kate Hudson looks mighty nice in those tight fitting clothes and bikini. The ease with which I fell into the story was exactly what I needed to end this rather rough day. And so it goes...Benjamin Finnegan (McConaughey) is an underwater treasure hunter, but he's hit some rough waters. His wife Tess (Hudson) is divorcing him. His boat that's financed by a meanspirited, island-owning rapper has just sunk. And his partner Alfonz (Ewen Bremner, DEATH AT A FUNERAL) has no qualms about leaving him when things are tough. He's been searching nearly his entire life for something known as The Queen's Dowry, a fortune in treasure that sunk aboard a ship in 1715. While hunting for this treasure, though, Benjamin must battle financial woes, a wife who still loves him but can't stand his antics (so much so that she's divorcing him), and the dangers being associated with a rapper/murderer who simply wants the benjamins.The outlandish nature of just about everything makes the entire production minimally cerebral at best. Examples are 300-year-old canons resting at the bottom of the ocean but we're still able to read what's written on them. Explosions that knock divers out of the water but don't harm them in any way. A bimbo richese daughter who knows nothing about ...well ...anything. And the list goes on.But even so, I was in the mood for all of this nonsense.

It made it a watchable movie to me.I can only assume that the writers wrote different parts and tried to patch them in, because when the action was there the comedy wasn't.When the comedy was present, action lacked.Even with it's minor flaws in geography and story, I found it entertaining and even funny.Over all it was good enough for me to say I liked it, but aside from a few moments, it still falls short of being a great movie.",Fool's Gold

Tess is once again pulled into the hunt and joins the new treasure hunters.(My Comment) This movie attempts to turn a romantic comedy into an action-packed thriller, but fails. The script was written like a TV soap opera that jumps all over the place. The movie would have been better if they had just searched for the treasure without having a group of bad guys trying to kill them. Even though there was a list of big stars in this movie, you would think that this was a movie made for TV movie of the week. However, if you are a fan of shirtless Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson in a bikini, you will like seeing this movie. There are some fabulous under water shots of the Caribbean and some funny scenes. This movie will not challenge your brain, so you can just sit back in the theater and enjoy watching it or you can wait for the DVD. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 1:50, Rated PG-13)(5/10)",Fool's Gold
40,richieandsam,I like this film...,7,18 February 2013,"FOOL'S GOLDI like this movie. I had seen it before in the cinema and liked it just as much the second time around.The film stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. These 2 work so well together... they were really good in How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days and now they work really well in this too. It is kinda like the new generation of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere back in the Pretty Woman days.Kate Hudson reminds me so much of her Mum, Goldie Hawn. They are both great actresses and can both be funny. Matthew McConaughey is a good actor. He is great in comedies, but he can also do serious acting. I think the best film he has made is A Time To Kill.This film is funny, but it is not a laugh out loud comedy. There are some funny moments, but I do not remember actually laughing out loud... but this film is still really enjoyable. The story is good and there are some good characters in it.I preferred HTLAGITD... it is a better comedy and more funny... but this is still a good movie. If you like films that you don't have to think too much about and are fun to watch with a bit of action and adventure... then this is your film.I will give it 7 out of 10.I hope these 2 do more films together. It is a winning combination.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",Fool's Gold

43,gregeichelberger,Ship of 'Fools',2,14 February 2008,"I find it fascinating that many times, when someone disagrees with the popular consensus on this site, that person tends to berate the other reviewers as opposed to stating why they like or dislike a certain film.This was never more true than in the case of ""Fool's Gold,"" one of the single worst movies in the past three years (in my humble opinion). Instead of regaling us with the picture's good points (which, by the way, there were none), these disgruntled individuals write things like, ""I think that people have nothing better to do but whine and moan cause they want to see every thing (sic) for free and have poor taste in movies.""Whatever. The sad fact is, we all have our opinions. My particular opinion regarding ""Fool's Gold"" has nothing to do with wanting to see ""every thing for free"" (whatever THAT means). My opinion about this film is based on the fact that I had to sit through this two-plus-hour monstrosity. It's also based on the fact that I brought my four-year old daughter along, which may constitute child abuse in many states.So, let's talk about the biggest bomb since Hiroshima, shall we? Matthew McConaughey is the perpetually bare-chested Ben Finnegan (His nickname is ""Finn,"" but who cares?!). He's an immature, 40ish beach bum and quasi-successful treasure hunter. He also pines for estranged wife, Tess (Kate Hudson), who is currently divorcing him (who wouldn't?).While scuba diving off the coast of Key West/Jamaica/Barbados, Ben finds a rare plate from a 1715 Spanish shipwreck (I remember the date so well because Ben relates the tale ad nauseam in several backstory fill-ins). While this is going on, however, his rented boat catches fire and sinks (the first of many lame ""comic"" situations), forcing him to be indebted to the gangsta rapper, Big Bunny (Kevin Hart, ""The 40-Year Old Virgin""), so named because he carries a rabbit around with him. Bunny also owns the island, but instead of waiting to be paid back for the vessel, he just orders his two idiotic goons (Brian Hooks and Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Theo on the ""Cosby Show"") to take Ben out to sea and kill him. I could have lived with that, but it doesn't happen. Instead, Ben escapes and saves the hat of the daughter of the incredibly wealthy Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland sporting bad hair and an even worse accent).He also meets Tess on the Honeycutt's yacht (she's a cook or servant of some kind - dressed like a crew member of the Love Boat) and then gets to relate the shipwreck story to us - again. Eventually, Honeycutt decides to foot the bill for the expedition. Oh, and don't get me started on the character of Honeycutt's brain-dead daughter, Gemma (Alexis Dziena, who looks more like Hannah Montana than Miley Cirus, and makes Paris Hilton look like Madam Curie), one of the single most annoying in cinematic history.In the meantime, another treasure hunter, Moe (Australian Ray Winstone, ""The Proposition""), is on the scene working for Big Bunny. Winstone makes his entry into the picture speaking like Rod Steiger in ""The Heat of the Night,"" but finding this Southern drawl too difficult to maintain, he reverts back to his native Aussie tongue. Likewise, Sutherland's tacky British accent soon drifts in an out with the tide, while Ben's sidekick, Alphonse's (Ewen Bremmer, ""Death At a Funeral"") vocal tack sounds roughly like a Serbo-Croation raised in India trying to imitate Andy Kaufman's ""Foreign Guy.""The movie then switches from light, breezy romantic adventure to a violent drama in which we are treated to several murders, some beatings, many attempted murders, a kidnapping and a plane crash, to boot - real funny. Plot then meanders like a Spanish galleon filled with gold and caught in a hurricane in 1715 (I remember that date because ... ) and sinks just as quickly.Then there's the ""love"" story. Let's face it, based on this film and the equally awful ""How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" McConaughey and Hudson are the Tracy and Hepburn of bad films. And, compared to these two, Robert Blake and his wife had much more chemistry and affection between them. One scene has Ben and Tess digging for clues in a church cellar and then making love - tepid, pointless and completely without passion.Readers of this review can do whatever they please with their hard-earned money, I'm just one voice crying in the wilderness not to waste it on this garbage scow.",Fool's Gold
44,vranger,A fun romp,8,17 February 2009,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Many funny scenes, physical, situational, and verbal. I'd regard it in similar terms with McConnahey's other treasure movie, Sahara.I had the advantage of liking the ocean, diving, and movies about treasure hunting. If you are too, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.The acting is solid throughout, the scenery is gorgeous, and the steps to solving the treasure mystery are both captivating and not nearly as 'out there' as in some other treasure hunting movies.You might have to forgive a couple of diving gaffes (being near an underwater explosion, even small, is pretty much going to kill you or at least ruin your hearing, but most adventure movies have a few factual errors like that. If you held them all accountable for them you'd never watch another one.",Fool's Gold
45,jemps918,The only saving grace in Fool's Gold was the view: the scenic Florida coast and Matthew McConaughey's manscape,3,19 March 2008,"The only saving grace in Fool's Gold was the view: the scenic Florida coast and Matthew McConaughey's manscape.Everything else was just begging to be criticized: the horrible editing, too many subplots were awkwardly thrown in, too much explanatory dialogue that only served to bore the audience and not illuminate the silly plot, Alexis Dziena...The supposedly exciting back story of the treasure hunt could have been better executed perhaps with a reenactment, but the producers probably just wanted to easily cash in on the cache of its box-office stars Kate Hudson and McConaughey, who play recently divorced treasure seekers Tess and Benjamin Finnegan. Somehow they are able to convince bazillionnaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland) to help them on their quest, while his daughter Gemma (played annoyingly by Dziena) tags along. Of course, evil people are also after the treasure, just to add some conflict.Unless you plan to just gawk at Hudson and McConaughey's tanned bods, or escape virtually into the beautiful beach expanse, don't bother wasting your time on this flick.",Fool's Gold

As I said, McConaughey and Hudson work well togetherespecially comically, but also romanticallyand the writers create some unique action sequences that are thoroughly splendiferous. The intricacies of the discovery process for the sunken treasure are also interesting, tho I liked the first National Treasure movie much better in this realm (involving icons of American history such as the Declaration of Independence).

48,Ozzy2000,Pec Implants and Kate Hudson don't mix,1,9 February 2008,"A beach-bum cum treasure hunter in Bahamas by the name of Benjamin Finnigan, played by Matthew McConaughy, stumbles upon evidence 18th century Queens Dowry of treasure that was lost at sea in 1715 whilst diving with his mate. At the same time through mishap he loses the boat which he hired from the local Jamaican Mafia boss. At the same he is being divorced by his wife Tess played by Kate Hudson who now has a real job as personal staff to millionaire Nigel Hunnicut played by Donald Sutherland, on his magnificent luxury yacht. Nigel's daughter Gemma Hunnycut played, by Alexis Dziena, joins her father on his luxury yacht and he is desperately trying to connect with his daughter by spoiling her and expressing his fatherly love for her but she is only very slowly coming around to it. Meanwhile Benjamin tries to connect to his ex wife but she wont wear it. However Benjamin connects with Gemma by retrieving her hat which impresses her to the extent she invites him on her rich daddy's yacht. At this point to the astonishment of of Tess Benjamin becomes part of Nigel's inner circle by befriending his daughter Gemma , who we now discover has am IQ and of about 10 and the mentality of a 14 year old. From there its all downhill. If you think Matthew McConaughy's pectoral implants look sexy or Kate Hudson's cosmetic face reconstruction looks great then this film is for you. Donald Sutherland's British accent is woeful. Maybe because it was shot on location at Australia's Port Douglas that this film is cursed with good old Mediocrity but believe me this film just tediously drags on with this really bad production style. I have given two stars for the shot when the ancient Spanish sword landed perilously between the spread legs of bikini clad Alexis Dziena which was rather pleasant.",Fool's Gold
49,dtb,"Fun Despite Flaws, FOOL'S GOLD Would Shine Even Brighter with More Romance, Less Exposition",7,10 February 2008,"I saw FOOL'S GOLD (FG) on its opening weekend at a $4 matinée, and I enjoyed it: it was at least 4 dollars' worth of fun. True, FG has its flaws, but director/co-writer Andy Tennant and company are canny enough to build audience goodwill by reminding us moviegoers what we liked about the star team of Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in their first film together, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS. For instance, I'd say it's no coincidence that, as in ...10 DAYS, McConaughey's character's name is Ben -- Ben Finnegan, though everyone calls him ""Finn"" -- and he happens to use the word ""Bull****"" a la the game they played in ...10 DAYS, in an early spat with Hudson's character, Tess. Once again Hudson and McConaughey, aided and abetted by a stellar supporting cast (most of them acting in accents other than their own. Scotsman Ewen Bremner's attempt at a Ukrainian accent is an incomprehensible hoot, presumably on purpose :-)), win us over with their comic and romantic chemistry. For example, in the leads' first scene together during their divorce proceedings, it's clear from Hudson's expressive face that Tess still loves Finn despite being justifiably furious at his irresponsible approach to life and personal finances, especially since she's smart enough that she should have seen it coming. (As Tess's lawyer sagely points out, ""Florida didn't ruin your life, you did. You married the guy for sex and expected him to be smart."") It also doesn't hurt that Hudson, looking fresher and lovelier than ever (sunshine suits her), and McConaughey, in boyish lovable rogue mode, both look gorgeous in beachwear as they swim, dash, bicker and banter all over the Florida coast (played picturesquely by Australia) in search of The Queen's Dowry, a sunken treasure ship, financed by wealthy Brit Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland) and chased by Finn's mentor/rival treasure-hunter Moe Fitch (Ray Winstone with a Texas-style accent) and murderous rap star/loan shark Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) and his Jamaican gangsta henchmen (Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Brian Hooks) and his vicious enforcer Cyrus (David Roberts).I'll admit that during our area's frigid winter months, I always enjoy watching movies set in sunny tropical locations, which may be why I'm usually easy to please when it comes to such films (as you'll see if you read my reviews of SUNBURN and the Hawaii-set 2004 remake of THE BIG BOUNCE elsewhere on the IMDb). Nevertheless, even I agree that this screwball romantic comedy-adventure, enjoyable though it is overall, could use some tightening. At times, as Joe Bob Briggs would say, FG has too much plot getting in the way of the story. When the movie concentrates on the lively treasure hunt undertaken by the still-smitten exes and their party, there's plenty of deep sea diving and action. Indeed, Finn is knocked down, batted around, and hit in the head more than a cartoon character (appropriate, really, considering that FG comes from Warner Bros., the studio that brought us the beloved Looney Tunes). Sheesh, if that kept happening to someone in real life, they'd be lucky to be alive! FG starts with a title card explaining The Queen's Dowry's history, supplemented in what seems like every other scene as Finn and Tess explain further details about the ill-fated ship to anyone who'll listen. To their credit, McConaughey and Hudson deliver these lines in ways that convey the rapture of people who truly love history and the thrill of discovery, but there's so much exposition that, despite my interest in the treasure hunt, these talky scenes teetered dangerously close to making me feel like I was trapped in a room with the kind of avid expert/fan types who are so busy blathering on about their pet subject, they don't notice they're perplexing and/or boring those of us who aren't familiar with the topic. Well, at least the stars are nice to look at while they do all that talking! :-) Maybe the folks behind FG should have trimmed the exposition (and saved it for the inevitable DVD's ""Deleted Scenes"" on the Special Features menu :-)), or had it acted out in flashbacks, or boned up on how to do it well by watching classics like THE MALTESE FALCON, which also used an opening title card and conversations for plot exposition, but rendered all that backstory fascinating instead of exhausting. Better they should've used that screen time to show all that sex between Tess and Finn that they just kept hinting about. Every time those two crazy kids are about to get into some hot and heavy lovin', they leap behind some piece of furniture so we can't even see them! :-) I also could have lived without the subplot with Nigel trying to reconnect with his ditzy jet-setter daughter Gemma (played with perky kookiness by Alexis Dziena). Sutherland and Dziena play their scenes well, but their little subplot simply doesn't add anything substantial to this already busy movie, unlike the delightful Michael Mulheren and Adam LeFevre, who steal each of their brief but charming scenes as the down-to-earth gay couple who work as chefs on Honeycutt's yacht and give steward Tess relationship advice. Anyway, while FG may not be 24-karat gold, it's not dross, either -- just a pleasant, unassuming date-movie bauble for fans of Hudson and McConaughey.",Fool's Gold
50,jaddison383,A Confused Movie...,4,13 February 2008,"Fool's Gold's biggest problem comes in the form of confusion. While employing two game lead actors, one notorious for making bad films sellable (that's you Matt!), neither Ms. Hudson or Mr. McConaughey could save this film that can't seem to decide whether it's a comedy or an action film.When an estranged couple meet mere hours after their divorce on board a privately owned super-yacht (she's working, he's slumming), their romance is instantly rekindled by a new clue into the treasure that has been their goal for years. Once they recruit the stupid and rich boat-owners, nothing's left but to be inspired by random things to each new unbelievable clue along the way.Kate Hudson positively glows on-screen here, but that radiance doesn't resonate with the rest of the film. Fool's Gold delivers very few laughs, relying mostly on slapstick and a dumb-girl character. And the whole plot doesn't even work that well. Many subplots that are put in place are never completed, and the dialogue doesn't go over well. All in all, this wasn't even a good romantic comedy OR an action movie- largely because it wouldn't commit to either genre mixing both elements unsuccessfully. Skip this one... 4/10 stars.Jay Addison",Fool's Gold
51,janyeap,Just a fool's comedy of errors...,6,5 February 2008,"This film attempts to offer a wild and silly escapist's fling before ultimately getting the audience to a happy, happy Hollywood ending.It basically relies on a script that throws in a cash-strapped and irresponsibly reckless beach bum with his bubbly, female sidekick; a wealthy English gent whose home and life, leisure and pleasure extend no further than his yacht would allow; a gang of violent scums, popping up in a helter-skelter manner, as if unsure of what they're supposed to do; a supplement of fable spin about some 1715 Spanish sunken ship carrying 40 chests of gold just waiting to be uncovered all crammed into events circling no further than the ocean and beach span. It comes off as being unsure of relying on the focus of romance or actions, sometimes having scenes drag on, or suddenly having them interrupted by cut-and-paste scenarios, just to get them to link.There's really nothing, in this film, to challenge one's brains, except for a nice splash of catchy, witty and humorous lines and phrases, especially those shot out of the mouth of Ewan Brenner's character, to provoke laughter. Yep, nothing unpredictable! Character and event links are oft provided awkwardly by insipid jesters like Alexis Dziena's Cemma. Yet, there are moments I really did enjoy with this film. Oh yes, the enormous chemistry oozing out of Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey's characters, his facial skits (despite his portrayal of an absurd, one-dimensional-minded devil-may-care character) that summon up memories of the articulated facial contortions and distortions of Charlie Chaplin's 'Tramp"", and Hudson's ever so delightfully sweet and expressive face, plus the fabulous shots of the deep-sea scuba diving treasure hunt are worthy of capturing.As I'm a great Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey fan, I'd be willing to throw my dollars for a tix to see this flick.

52,robertallenandersonjr,A great romantic comedy,8,10 April 2008,Fool's Gold was a pretty good movie all and all. I thought that it was a little slow moving in the beginning. It surprisingly had some funny and exciting action scenes. The acting was played pretty well between all the cast. I think that Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson do a great job together. There were also some very funny parts in the movie. It also very cute and had some pretty interesting things in the movie. One thing so good about this movie is that it makes you feel like your in the movie. I love adventure movies where they are on a beach and ocean. All and all this is a great romantic comedy and is worth your money. If you are seeing this movie to see Kate Hudson in a bikini the whole time shes not. As a matter of fact she is only in a bikini once. Matthew McConaughey on the other hand has his shirt off a lot this movie. Overall this was a very fun romantic comedy.,Fool's Gold

It is full of sunshine, beautiful scenery and fun action without gratuitous profanity or violence. Yes, there IS violence insofar that there are some fights and shooting between the good guys (and girls) and the bad guys but then what would you expect in an action movie?I particularly enjoyed Donald Sutherland's upper crust English accent - I say, what an awfully super chap he was don't ya think! As for his bimbo daughter, well she came right in the end too and, I noted in the closing scene, ended up with the East European jerk! I did notice that, in a scene supposedly shot in Key West, there was one shot of a junction between Water Street and Water Avenue. Neither street exists in Key West! But then it WAS all a story wasn't it?Altogether a great romp worth, in my opinion, more than its score on IMDb.

All the characters are stock, incredibly predictable, and you know what is going to happen long before it does. The timing is off, the funny one liners are really not very funny, and non of the set pieces are particularly original. This is a film you desperately want to like, because taken together it's rather cute and sweet, but that is the problem, somehow it lacks enough zip to be adventurous, it is not especially romantic, or funny and the whole thing is just too predictable for words.

It's kind of difficult to get where this film is coming from. It isn't funny enough to be a comedy nor is it serious enough to be a pure action-adventure, and it's a little too adult to be classed as family (but not that bad). The result is a kind of light-hearted tongue-in-cheek adventure-comedy, not bad if that's what you were expecting. If you're expecting a more serious film like National Treasure (even though that's also for young people) you will be disappointed. The story is simple, if not a bit all over the place, and requires little to no thinking, perfect for a relaxing afternoon film, shame I can't stand the leads.",Fool's Gold

Or you're with friends where after a very long and drunken lunch you collapse and the friend has the remote control. The plot is not so much formulaic as without formula at all. Take all the kids' buried treasure films you have seen. Add a modicum of racy chat hinting unsubtly at the long and hot sex that the two main protagonists have had in the past. Squeeze past the censor some gratuitous shagging in a church (well hidden behind the pews). Mix in some stereotypical baddies who seemed to have failed the audition for the latest Bond movie (one strokes a Rabbit - and is called""Bigg Bunny). Get colourful locations with neat opportunities for some good underwater footage. Cast it with Kate Hudson who peaked early with her Oscar nomination eight years ago (for ""Almost Famous"") and has made dross ever since. Opposite her put Matthew McConaughey who is certainly just as pretty as she is and who has a following amongst those not too fussy about body odour. Add Donald Sutherland doing just a bit more than he needed to to pick up the cheque for his portrayal of the British rich toff with the wayward bimbo daughter (Alexis Dziena). That's about it really.Hudson acts OK but looks rather strange. She has the opportunity to show off her very boyish figure (flat chest and neat butt) but is about as far removed from the Hollywood queens of yore as it is possible to get. Is she a Gay icon?

61,dmanyc,Don't be Fooled. This is a stupid film.,1,2 April 2009,"You have to be a fool to sit through Fool's Gold. Yet another bad romantic comedy Hollywood unleashes. A broke, on-the-verge-of-divorce, deep-sea treasure hunter spots a clue to a long-lost treasure in Key West and drags his estranged wife, his buddy, a multi-millionaire and his spoiled stupid daughter to find it, all the while dodging a wealthy rapper with a stupid stage name and even stupider henchmen.1) Once upon a time, Matthew McConaughey was poised to be the next Paul Newman. These days he seems more like a professional beach bum, both on and off the screen.2) Kate Hudson was poised to be the next big thing, but has basically been in one crappy film after another, displaying neither talent nor personality. Simply put, she's just a member of the Lucky Egg Club.3) Donald Sutherland deserves better than this. He really should call Keifer to get on his show.4) What was the point of the daughter? She was a hybrid of Paris Hilton/Hannah Montana that was really a waste of celluloid. She wasn't even attractive. She looked like a twelve year old playing dress-up. Her voice and her constant stupidity made me cringe. A friend of mine once said ""There's no crime in being stupid. It's staying stupid that's a crime."" I say playing stupid or being stupid is...well, just plain stupid. I kept waiting for someone, anyone, to yell at her to stop being stupid, but she just kept on being stupid.

62,tom-456,"An excellent, grossly underrated adventure/comedy",8,11 October 2008,"I don't typically give a comedy a rating any higher than 6, because I think that higher ratings should be reserved for more serious movies. But I make an exception for Fool's Gold, because it is one of the best adventure/comedies that I have seen in a long, long time. I watched it on DVD, and the only reason that I did not go to see it in the theater is because it didn't get a very good user rating in IMDb. Yet, the people who rate movies on IMDb gave ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", which was one of the absolute worst, least funny movies that I have ever seen, a rating of 8.0, which has since slid to 7.6. The explanation for this is either that some people have figured out how to cheat the ratings that show up on IMDb, or else the people who are taking the time to rate movies at IMDb are predominately a bunch of brainless teenagers.Fool's Gold is a well scripted, well acted adventure/comedy that will keep you interested and chuckling from start to finish. I expected more of a romantic comedy between McConaughy and Hudson, and I was pleased to discover that it was not that at all. I was pleased about this because I just don't like those old Doris Day - Rock Hudson style of comedy, and much prefer a good action-adventure with a comic undertone, which is what this movie really is. It is a treasure hunt, and a very good one at that. Not quite as good as the ""National Treasure"" movies in some ways, but definitely a lot funnier.Donald Sutherland is one of the all-time great comedic actors, and his talents are on full display in Fool's Gold. He plays the role of Nigel Honeycutt perfectly. Alexis Dzenia is delightful and charming as his bimbo daughter, and she shows once more that she has a long career to look forward to. McConaughey and Hudson play their parts as professionals, which is to say that they acted to perfection notwithstanding that they were not challenged by the roles. The lesser actors all play their parts very well.All in all, it was an action/adventure/comedy of very high caliber. It is unfortunate that it did not get a higher rating than it did by the IMDb users, because that rating is a gross misrepresentation of the true quality of this movie. It is far, far better than what you will anticipate judging from that rating. If you are prone to enjoy movies of this variety, then unless there is something seriously askew in your psycho-emotional makeup, you will almost certainly enjoy this movie. I intend to buy a copy and add it to my collection.",Fool's Gold
63,petsteph1,Good to watch - and thank God for IMDb!,7,13 August 2008,"I say Thank God for IMDb because if you choose movies based on the critics say so or 'say no' you can end up pretty confused, and miss out on some good productions. This movie was trashed by the critics - the same critics who gave the most recent Mummy installment higher ratings. Without getting into The Mummy, this movie was definitely much more viewable, way more entertaining, and of a much better quality. Matthew McConnaughey and Kate Hudson didn't sizzle but the script didn't call for it; Donald Sutherland seemed to be phoning his performance in and having fun doing it and that was what the slightly goofy storyline needed. It has good action, amusing characters, many funny scenes and it rocks on at a good pace. It's good for the family and a relief from over-hyped and under-performing brain-beaters. A lot of fun.",Fool's Gold

It might fit in with Ishtar and Rhinestone and other bad classics if the people involved had done something worthwhile before. Otherwise it is the apex of their art and they should be put down. ""Insipid"" is a word that comes to mind, along with ""cliche"" and ""rubbish"".The screenplay may have been done by a computer program. The directing and acting may also have been the result of less than human endeavors. Junior high film students would top this easily with no budget. This might have worked as a porn flick, but the actors kept their clothes on - so it didn't work at all.Donald Sutherland badly doing a goofy accent is maybe the high point.You must have something better to do.",Fool's Gold

Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey have a rocky relationship that is re-kindled by a treasure hunt. The story is slow moving and largely uninspiring. I could care less if they save the relationship or find the gold. I'm not sure if I was supposed to fear the end of McConaughey's life or laugh as a mildly dangerous rap icon and his bumbling thugs pursue payment on past debts. The movie was not successful at creating fear or laughs and was stuck in the irrelevant middle. I was eager for it to end so I can't advise anyone to watch Fool's Gold unless they are interested in wasting 112 minutes.,Fool's Gold

I loved Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in their first film, ""10 Days,"" they did together so I knew they would have awesome chemistry again in ""Fool's Gold,"" which they did. I thought that the movie was exciting, funny, adventurous and overall very entertaining. It was neat following along in the story and trying to figure out all of the clues to determine where the treasure was. I must admit however that it was not as good as I expected or hoped it would be and I thought that it could have been better. Both actors had the potential to successfully pull off stronger roles if only they had been given them in the script. I think both of their personalities are what really saved the movie and made it enjoyable to see. The movie did have some good one-liners. Also I thought the location where the film was shot was beautiful and really made you wish you were at the beach! All in all, it is definitely not an award winner but if you're looking for a good movie full of fun and adventure then you'll enjoy ""Fool's Gold."" It has its moments- it made me laugh.",Fool's Gold

Do I like movies from Pasolini, Kurosawa, Kitano etc ...yes I do. Do I like a good action packed movie or SF , yes I do .

73,jhobdell,Oddball,7,20 April 2008,"This is a strange movie, in a lot of ways. I think the two main characters work well together. The chemistry is possibly not as great as it could be but it works for me. My main gripe with it is the accents: I'm a firm believer that if you want a particular accent you only have three options:- 1) Johnny Depp or Gary Oldman (is that two options?) 2) Get someone with the accent 3) (Failing 1 or 2) change your mindRay Winstone is not a convincing Texan or Aussie or whatever he's meant to be, and Donald Sutherland is not a convincing Englishman (even allowing for however long he may have spent in America).I also agree with one of the previous comments that it can't make up it's mind about being a romantic comedy or an action movie, and if it's meant to be both there are a few glaring things that ruin it - my main remembered one being when one of Big Bunny's thugs gets shot.On the other hand, if you can get past all that, the film is very enjoyable and mostly comes across as a good fun adventure. It's almost reminiscent of 'The Goonies' and having made that observation it might have worked better with a younger cast.",Fool's Gold

Comedies are hard work, and that's the strong part of ""Fool's Gold"": the nonchalant, professional cast. When you start lifting the eyebrow because the daggers fly all too deep, one disapproving glance of Donald Sutherland and all is reconciled. Ray Winstone is another surety for twinkles of old-school class under the genre-typical layers of sixpacks, caramel tan, tight skin and funky hairdos.I don't like to compare, but a friend reckoned it being ""Sahara"" and ""Into the blue"" rolled up into one hell of a user-friendly spliff...

It follows the story of two treasure hunters (Mcconaughey & Hudson) looking for a lost Spanish treasure while (mainly Mcconaughey) attempts to avoid his debt issues with a notoriously dangerous rapper who lent him money for his treasure hunts.OK, now for the substance of the movie. Firstly, it is and is classified as an adventure movie so don't go expecting plot twists, scary scenes and so on...there aren't any! What it simply is a relaxing, entertaining and enjoyable way to spend 114min. I rather enjoyed it because Mcconaughey and Hudson are very good actors IMO and their chemistry in the film is good. Donald Sutherland gives in a good performance as he usually does and in amongst all the adventure there are also a few touching scenes. The film has humorous scenes and bad guys who you actually hope lose! So at the end of the day, it's bright, cheerful and funny and leaves you feeling quite good.7/10 and recommended!",Fool's Gold

Everything from the cinematography to the direction was just bad. It's one thing to do a mediocre romantic comedy but this one ""bit the big one"". I don't think the ""simplest minds"" would enjoy this one. The writers should know by now that we've seen all these situations before in every soap opera and TV sitcom.

84,wzevonfan,Only a fool would think this movie is gold.,4,26 July 2008,"Let me just say, first off the bat, I don't like romantic comedies. I believe that they are all tacked on, corny, and ridiculously predictable. But sure, I still watch the occasional one now and then, hoping that the movie will shatter my preconceived notions. Alas, I have yet to find one that I really enjoyed. Fools Gold is no exception. I watched this film on a plane ride back to the States from Paris, having exhausted all of the other options in the movie selection. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays Ben Finnegan an immature, klutzy, treasure hunter trying to find some ancient riches left over from a shipwreck. Kate Hudson, Tess Finnegan, plays his wife who is, guess what? tired of her husbands silly antics. She has given up on her dreams to find the treasure, because Ben has no money and has not found anything. She divorces him. Somewhere along the story Ben gets involved with the Honeycutt family. Donald Sutherland plays Nigel Honeycutt, and obviously wealthy man who is spending a few weeks with his spoiled ditsy daughter on his yacht, touring the beauty of the sea. His daughter acts like little miss perfect to her ""daddy"" but really hates him. I won't go any further into the story, simply because it is so convoluted and I could spend hours here writing about it. The movie was pitiful. Its only redeeming qualities were the direction and scenery. Thats it. Everything else, the acting, the slapstick comedy, the storyline, was trite and overdone. This is the kind of movie where you don't have to think to enjoy it. If you have an IQ of 45 though, I will tell you to go out and get it, because it might be enjoyable then. Hopelessly predictable, a typical ""cute"" romantic comedy, that I do not recommend.",Fool's Gold

I walked out of the theatre quite pleased; even if this movie will not get an Oscar, it earned the price of my ticket. It's campy, silly, and bright, and there is nothing like a fluffy romp around the sunny islands to cure those winter blues.Admittedly, it's a contrived, predictable mystery, but that proves to be the focus rather than the romantic comedy that was promoted. But in the spirit of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, it's a spunky predictable mystery. No, the characters were not all complex, but at least the powers that be went to the trouble of making them entertaining and personable.I liked the idea of looking for sunken treasure. I liked the upbeat island soundtrack. I liked the funny characters. I liked the pretty scenes and the silly lines. I liked the random explosions and fight scenes, as pleasantly ridiculous as they were.Kate and Matthew have the chemistry they had in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".

For example, Ishtar does have some moments worth watching and Heaven's Gate in the long, uncut version is a flawed work of great genius. Fool's Gold, however, is Ed Wood awful without any of the charm. From its imbecilic and derivative screen play to the drooling, slack-jawed direction and on to the execrable acting, from everyone including, incredibly enough, Donald Sutherland, this movie is a cold, drying turd that everyone should avoid stepping in. It is a laugh-less, humorless comedy and a plodding, somnolent adventure film.

Both McConaughey and Hudson were excellent together, and Dziena was a perfect spoilt daughter next to Sutherland. This is a romantic story with lots of funny moments and lots of good action, yet near the margins of a fairy tale.But what I liked the most in the story and the characters was that even stupidity of some of them was surrounded by love and understanding, which made me feel like I was with them no matter their different ""character"". And on the other hand, the bad guys had a clumsy touch of a somewhat ""bad joke"" in their general presence.

Lots of underwater footage, beachy locations, sexy but not too sexy - no big deal, right? Wow. The writers REALLY don't get what a romantic comedy is supposed to be at all. They also, it should be noted, have no idea how to write a filmable script.There are far too many scenes of characters sharing expository dialogue (which is fine if it happens once, maybe twice) to help the lesser minds in the audience catch up. But the plot is so needlessly convoluted that after the overdrawn setup is finally explained these hacks manage to make you 1) still not understand what the hell is going on and 2) not care anymore.Boredom sets in early as numerous subplots are cast aside for a handful of overplayed ones. The ""in debt to gangsters"" plot, the ""stern but benevolent father figure"" plot and the always exciting ""come on, it's obvious you two are still in love"" plot.Some side notes: too many people are killed, shot or mortally maimed by geysering tide waters. Seriously, I can handle Rambo but not in this movie. Also, the climactic plane crash played for laughs in the trailer? It's played for heavy, heavy suspense and drama in the movie. Tone deaf writing and direction.The cast, it should be noted, with the exception of one terribly written part that sadly would humiliate any actor, comes off alright by the credits - you can't fault their professional devotion to the craft, even if it is in service of such crappy amateur material like this script.",Fool's Gold

His character is charming in a goofy way. He seems to mess everything up, but somehow in the end it all work out.I did not care too much for the character Gemma, but nonetheless I laughed at her idiotic comments because I have met people as naive as her. She's basically a miniature Paris Hilton at sea who knows nothing about the sea.I wouldn't describe this movie as thrilling, but it was entertaining. The comedy is shallow here and there.

I think this movie was so widely panned because people don't have any adventure in their own lives so they don't know how to have fun with a very entertaining movie like Fool's Gold. This movie is an example of why I go to the movies. I love adventure! This movie isn't a smart film full of great wit and clever dialogue, but it is pure adventurous fun. I loved it and I wish Hollywood would make more movies like this. A couple of years ago I think a lot of people really missed out on a great movie when the critics tore apart the movie Sahara. Not only did a lot of people miss out on that movie, but because Sahara failed in the box office we all miss out on what could have been a great series of movies with Clive Cussler's Dirt Pitt character. I would have loved to see more of Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures brought to the screen. Our loss because so many people listen to critics who have no adventure in their own lives and therefore can't relate to a great adventure on film and they pan movies like Fool's Gold and Sahara. I'm glad the National Treasure films have been well received as well as the Pirates of the Caribbean films, but we need a lot more great adventures on films.

I guess it would be an acceptable date movie, but just don't expect to be wowed by anything.A very predictable plot, shallow characters, over-the-top overacting and a series of coincidences reminded me of the movie Sahara. Donald Sutherland was good but even he couldn't save this movie.If you've already seen everything at the video store and you want a mildly entertaining movie to watch, pick this up.

Alexis Dziena does an admirable jobs as a bimbo and is actually believable. Donald Sutherland should have known better than to get involved with a movie featuring McConaughey.

After seeing Kate and Matt in ""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days,"" expectations were high for them being wonderful together again; but their scenes in this film were mostly lackluster, and you find yourself wanting them to: be more intense? More physical? Have more closeups? Better directing or editing? The 'villains' were too cookie-cutter absurd, that's for sure (and almost all African-American, which reeked of racism, even if they were supposed to be in the Bahamas). Donald Sutherland, usually a great actor, was so miscast in this film (or perhaps his role was just lame). The subplot of getting close to his estranged daughter again felt very artificial, although I must admit I liked the perkiness and energy of the actress playing Gemma, and thought she did well with this inferior part (including the awful 'sword between the legs' scene). -- Kate and Matt, please come back again with a winner (and get Karan Johar or Gurinder Chadha to direct, too!).",Fool's Gold

I expected a fun, exotic, exciting adventure, which the movie delivered upon. It is a fairly predictable movie, but always fun to watch Mathew McConaughey play the guy who hasn't grown up along with Kate Hudson playing the lady who wishes he would. Their chemistry is great, and isn't that all you really expect from a movie like this, regardless of plot?The only thing that didn't fit in the movie was a couple of overly bloody scenes (on an absolute basis the blood was very minor, but the fact that they showed up at all was surprising.)Not the best movie you will ever see, but will certainly give you a break from all this extreme winter weather we have been having.",Fool's Gold

This may not have been on the Oscar shortlist in its release year, but if you don't like this movie you deserve to go to Guantanamo Bay. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey plan to steal $40,000 worth of Ohioan gold from a Civil War beach bunker, but it's a race to the finish against virile paraplegic ""Wheels"" (Donald Sutherland) who wants to liquidate the gold to buy his legs back from a Russian mobster's freezer. There are a multitude of dark comedy spots that hit the mark, like when McConaughey murders a man with a stapler gun when he threatens to blow his cover and when Kate Hudson successfully negotiates the release of a hostage by agreeing to never appear in a movie after 2011. Parts of the movie haven't aged well, like when Donald Sutherland's twin brother ""Bloodclot Scott"" is revealed and it's a green screened-in Sutherland with black shoe polish on his face and a Rastafarian wig. That's okay because the rest of the movie is really good. I won't give away too much, but let's just say that most-if not all-of the main characters die.

They tried very hard to make this movie clever and ""kitchy"", but ended up with a confusing mess. For some reason Kate Hudson is screaming and/or squealing in every scene, and Matthew McConaughey seems to always be shoeless. As movies go, this one is also very predictable.

I think it is definitely geared towards the female viewer, as Mconahey is shirtless for 9/10ths of the film, so my review is from the standpoint of a guy who had to watch this because he made his wife watch Rambo .... It is a campy, cheesy story, which I kind of enjoyed, but it has a lot of character motivation is blatantly manufactured, even for the camp factor--- SPOILER ALERT---Suddenly the dopey daughter is riveted by a treasure hunt, the dude that tried to blow up the main character suddenly comes to his rescue, the hip-hop mogul never has more than one or two thugs around him (he owns an island, where are his thugs?), the good guys don't bother to chase the plane with the speedboat so they can have a wave runner chase, but where exactly did the wave runners come from? This could easily have been a much better movie, but it comes off as a poor man's national treasure. This is one of those softball movies that my wife loves, that I can sit through, and that if you don't get around to renting it don't worry, it will be on TNT on Sunday afternoon during football season in a year or two.

It definitely has it's moments, but don't all movies.It was hard to get into the movie and really follow. It wasn't until the grave yard scene that I really started paying attention. The story really picked up from there, and I just had to find out if the treasure was really where they thought it would be. I saw the scene in the trailer where McConaughey's character says that he learned to fly from watching Playstation and the full scene in the movie is more comical and makes me laugh every time. It makes you wonder though if flying a plane in real life is anything like the video games.Even though the movie didn't start off quite that great, it still was worth it to see because you just can't deny the great on screen chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey.",Fool's Gold

Sometimes that's all you need to have a good time. Besides i would say that Matthew Mcconaughey played spectacular like he always does. Yeah, the plot and actions of characters are very naive that's for sure, but look at the bright side - you got stunning landscapes, cool cast and a cheery mood. That's not bad after all.

The girl that played the little teen daughter was irritating, and Donald Southerland had little work with but made the most of it. Wait for it to come out on video, if you must see it, otherwise, don't waste your time. The worst scene is the one in which they are explaining the treasure's history to Donald S and his daughter.

114,bloomjc,A formulaic movie that looks pretty but is basically shallow,1,8 February 2008,"FOOL'S GOLD (2008) 1 star out of 4. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson, Donald Sutherland, Ewen Bremmer, Ray Winstone, Alexis Dziena, Kevin Hart and Malcolm Jamal-Warner. Story by John Claflin and Daniel Zelman. Screenplay by John Claflin, Daniel Zelman and Andy Tennant. Directed by Andy Tennant. Rated: PG-13. Running time: Approx; 115 mins.Fool's Gold is a harmless excursion, a cinematic vacation that is simply nice to look at. It is all fluff and no substance.Basically it is a cookie-cutter, formulaic feature that offers pretty scenery, pretty stars and not much else.The movie tries to be part adventure, part screwball comedy but succeeds at neither.The plot, a hunt for long-lost Spanish treasure is simplistic. The characters are cardboard and stereotypical. They are just archetypes.The only people who will get any enjoyment out of this feature are those who love to ogle Matthew McConaughey shirtless  which he is for a good part of the film  or would like to see Kate Hudson in a bathing suit.Originality seems to have been buried along with the treasure everyone is seeking.(SPOILER)The film opens with McConaughey's Finn and Hudson's Tess getting divorced, but you know by the fade-out they will be together again.It seems this was just thrown in for convention  because that's they way it's always done in the screwball genre.Everything about the movie feels familiar.Also along for the cruise are Donald Sutherland who plays a British billionaire with one of the phoniest English accents heard on screen in a decade.Ray Winstone plays a fellow treasure hunter and speaks with some sort of Southern accent, but from what part of the south and from what country is never made clear.Fool's Gold is no treasure. It offers more pyrite than riches. It's like one of those DVDs of a fireplace you put on your television screen.

However, as my first film of my marathon day, I found it delightful, and unexpectedly good. Matthew McConaughey, as Benjamin Finnegan, was this fun-loving, no-bars-hold, treasure hunter, whose character was funny, with a personality that just drew you to him. Kate Hudson, as Tess Finnegan, the tough and cute, take-no-crap kind of lady, equally enjoyable to watch. Donald Sutherland, a great character actor does a wonderful job as the rich tycoon looking for spur of the moment adventure. Alexis Dzenia, as the ditsy spoiled rich Gemma Honeycutt, looking cute and lovable, made me laugh. I would say overall this movie did exactly what it was suppose to do. It was an adventurous, fun, piece of escapism, that took my mind off my stresses, and made me laugh for awhile.

I didn't want to see this movie because I found the commercials boring and dull and also silly. I was happy I went along with friends, we all laughed, held out breath in places, rooted for the good guys to get that good.

The plot is somewhat basic hunky man and gorgeous woman goes searching for lost treasure at the bottom of the ocean, throw in a couple of minor characters (one of them a very rich millionaire played by Donald Sutherland), some stereotype bad guys add in a little bit action and humour and that's Fool's Gold in a nutshell. The chemistry between Matthew McConaughy and Kate Hudson is brilliant (they worked really well together even on 'How to lose a guy in 10 days'.) and the humour made me laugh out loud especially the stupid comments of the dim-witted dilettante Gemma Honeycutt played by Alexis Dziena. Although when the main bad guy (Bigg Bunny aka Bugs Bunny)asked his henchman 'Where's Cyrus?' to which the henchman replies 'he'll be up in a minute' followed by Cyrus' mangled, water spout corpse being blown up in the air I had to cringe a little at that one. The other thing that got me was when Moe got shot in the water by the harpoon gun and he was bleeding why were there no sharks around to feed on him? (unless the Bahamas doesn't have sharks? I have no idea) But when you go to see this film don't expect too much as it's supposed to be silly romance comedy. so I give it my 7 out of 10 vote.Jumana P.",Fool's Gold

Kate Hudson put in an acceptable performance, but for some reason her body was never shown during this film, which was set in the waters off of Bahama! Not even one bathing suit shot? ha ha - maybe she should hit the gym.I actually paid to see it, as I am a SCUBA diver who has been entertained by the Clive-Cussleresque genre of ""adventure"" stories in the past.

It is possible to argue that this movie is ultimately a comedy and therefore its goofiness can be forgiven, however,the attempts at humour all missed due to bad delivery and lack of wit.

In fact, they seemed like one of the worst movie couples ever in that movie.Fool's Gold's plot was stupid and drawn-out. Nothing made sense and I was consistently confused throughout the movie. I hated the whole cheesy treasure-hunting theme; it was all so ridiculous to me, and I wanted to leave forty minutes into the film, willing to wait outside for the person who dragged me into the stupid movie.There was WAY too many cheesy clichés in the film, like the dumb bimbo daughter who was supposed to make you laugh- keyword, SUPPOSED, because she will NOT- but really sucked up the movie even more (something I didn't think was remotely possible) and made me want to throw up; and of course the villain, a pimp named ""Big Bunny"" who was retarded enough to make the stupid rub off onto the audience.Overall, this movie was god awful and so terrible I felt like throwing up.

McConaughey, Hudson and the other supporting characters deliver more than adequate performances and Donald Sutherland is as brilliant as he can be considering the overall quality of this movie.Last but not least, pay attention to the accents, It seems like everybody has a fake (funny fake) accent.

However, it's a true treat to watch her read out the continuous, bizarre, reverential lines dedicated solely to McConaughey's sexual prowess and majesty. It looks it it genuinely hurts after a while.I don't know what underground bunker McConaughey was keeping the writing team's families in, but I hope this script satisfies the demands he made.The only other thing of note is that in the briefest glimpse of self awareness it has an effective scene in which a very rich very old man is confronted by his daughter about the implicitly predatory and transactional nature of his marrying her young mother at the age he did.Then that last brain cell dies and scene ends on a joke about how the daughter is too dumb to live independently, ha ha.Also, perhaps inconsequential to most.

Alexis Dziena was also a surprise as the air-headed daughter of the millionaire benefactor played by Donald Sutherland (hated the accent, what was that supposed to be? Euro-trash?). Sure, this movie was a bit smarmy here and there, but this one plays strictly for laughs and warm emotions. I thought some of the actions scenes were very well done for a comedy. I actually found myself unconsciously squirming in my seat during a couple of the suspenseful moments. Of course the Caribbean scenery was also great to look at. Given the lack of decent date-movies lately, Fool's Gold is a welcomed 'treasure'.",Fool's Gold

At first glance what is not to like: Matt McConaughy(sp?), Kate Hudson, Donald Sutherland, beautiful scenery, and buried treasure! but alas it all gets wasted.The story is dumb, the humor is dumb, the acting is dumb. No real adventure. You just kind of sit there wondering if it is ever going to get better. It doesn't. They tried to get you to laugh but there was nothing funny to laugh about! don't see this one. Maybe, on a boring night with nothing else to do you could rent it.",Fool's Gold

It was actually my second choice but I thought my wife would prefer it. My initial interest was Kate Hudson, but the trailer had peaked my curiosity. As it turned out, I really liked the movie. The comedy of errors that start the story set the tone of the movie as a relatively mild intensity adventure. It doesn't pretend to be more than that. It will not compete with Indiana Jones for awards, but you don't get to see an Indiana Jones adventure every weekend.The result is that it's funny, interesting, and not especially predictable. Movie-snobs should not attend. This movie is for people wanting 90 minutes (113 actually) of light hearted entertainment. It is listed for the categories of adventure, comedy, romance, and thriller.

you can't tell if it's a rom-com (what we came for) , an action movie or a father-daughter relationship drama , which the film has all, but just scratches the surface of each. the actors are charming as usual, and locations and soundtrack great, but exadurated action ruins a bit.",Fool's Gold

Fool's Gold is not worth the price of an evening admission, however it's worth a matinée on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Many critics were too harsh on this film and need to lighten up.

Seriously...what is all the hype? I don't see it at all in her face. Sorry...just had to rant... Anyways, the plot was decent, the rapper's island was a pretty funny scenario, and of course, the ending was very predictable. All in all, not a great movie, but it was entertaining.

Matthew McConahaugh(I know I spelled it wrong.Sorry.) and Kate Hudson have EXCELLENT chemistry together on set. They are both also very good actors. There is a lot of humor in this movie and a dose of action as well. Its not boring either, there is a story line to it that keeps you wanting to know more.

143,contest-9,"Boring, boring, boring",2,8 February 2008,"I saw this film at a pre-release screening. What could have been an interesting plot was massacred into herky-jerky tale which bored and annoyed.The dialog was mind-numbingly dull at times. Repeated, endless explanations of how they would find the treasure tested the audience's patience. I wanted them to just hurry up and find the damn treasure so as to end the irritating incessant discussions about it.McConaughey must have taken a bottle of over-acting pills before every scene. His over-the-top attempt to be cutesy and endearing proved simply irritating and alienating. It was a performance similar to a junior high drama student. Painful and trite.Hudson's performance was a bit less irritating but swayed from one extreme (of showing despise for ex-husband McConaughey) to the other (being drawn to his faux-charm) and proved hollow. Her over-acting was overshadowed by McConaughey's an thus did not stand out as much as it could have.The subplot of Gemma (Alexis Dziena) and her rich father (Donald Sutherland) was pointless. Though Dziena is a true beauty (the new Audrey Hepburn) and provides much eye-candy, her character was meaningless to the plot. Hudson's character alternately criticizes then comforts Dziena's character but to no useful purpose to either character nor the plot.I really hope Dziena rises above this film to make more sophisticated films worthy of her beauty, poise, and screen presence.As lame as the two lead actors were, the writer and director bear the worst of the blame. How the dialog was permitted to end up on film this way is a mystery. A simple stopwatch would have aided the effort of ending the cinematic carnage created by endless ""...and then we found out this..., and then we found out that..."" There was no shortage of opportunities during the film for making a run for more popcorn without missing anything.So what could have been an interesting tale of sunken treasure and romance rekindled was instead about as interesting as the romance in Twister.Don't bother seeing this film.

The character Gem was hard to take and didn't seem to fit into the context of the story at all. The plot didn't seem to bring anything new that I hadn't seen many times before and the storyline, at times, was just plain boring. I found myself wondering when it was going to be over.

I laughed and so did a lot of other people so I would definitely say it was worth the money and watching. Sometimes I think that people have nothing better to do but whine and moan cause they want to see every thing for free and have poor taste in movies. those are the people that wait in line three days to watch star wars and think everything else sucks. May have rated this a little high but wanted to get it up to at least 6.5/10. Has a couple slow parts but good story, and good footage of the ocean. I have liked all of Matthews movies over the years and Kate for that matter. The last movie they were in together was really good too. For a guy going to a chick flick with his girl at least it has some blood and action and doesn't make you want to cry. I want to get some scuba gear and go look for treasure myself after watching this movie. Hope most of you don't read the first comment and give this a try to see if its worth it for yourself. I use to listen to a friend of my all the time about movies and would eventually see them and disagree most of the time and feel misinformed about how good a movie is. Now if he told me that a movie is a waste of time I would go see just to see if he was just being to hard on a good movie or telling the truth.

I've no complaints about them, but I'll avoid this director in future.The script needed a heavy, critical edit. Unfortunately, it didn't get it.here were a number of directional choices that I just didn't get. I'm not sure what the point of Gemma was, and the money shot with the sword was deeply tacky - I got the feeling the director wanted to see how long he could point a camera directly at the crotch of a teenage girl without it becoming too explicit for the rating. The nominal bad guys were so ineffective and stereotypical it was painful, and the racial aspect was both blatant and offensive, and it was this that truly sunk the movie for me.

157,bond_girl_0076,Disappointing and irritating.,1,9 February 2008,"This movie was unbelievably disappointing, after the great chemistry and comedic timing of Hudson and McCounaghy in ""How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days"", I expected something at least marginally as funny or cute. The writing and the dialogue were insipid. Scenes which should have been hysterical were instead so poorly timed that it left me scratching my head. This movie was in dire need of some ruthless editing; for instance, the scene where Hudson and McCounaghy are explaining the history of the shipwrecked Aurelia to Sutherland. That was some of the most boring, long-winded, convoluted dialog I've ever heard in a so-called adventure movie, and it went on for several minutes. The entire scene should have been cut.The comedic timing was off...way off. For instance, the scene where Hudson tells the Gemma character, ""There are other ways of getting attention besides acting like a bimbo,"" and then there is an awkwardly long pause before the ""Ukrainian Sidekick"" character says, ""Like what?"" This scene is followed by another awkwardly long pause where the characters stare at each other; presumably this is to allow the audience time to laugh at this ""brilliant"" piece of wit.And why in the name of all that is holy did the writer feel the need to introduce the Gemma Honeycutt character to this story? I felt like the writer was trying so hard to tell the audience, ""This character is supposed to be stupid, do you get it everyone? This character is stupid,"" I felt like saying, ""We get it, already. She's an idiot."" The writer, in trying to convey that Gemma is a moron, underestimated the intelligence of the entire audience. The character was so annoying that I literally wanted to punch her. Anyone who claims that the character was realistic because they have, in fact, met people that stupid needs to seriously re-evaluate their associates.I felt like this movie was a complete waste of my money, and I lament that I paid the premium price for the ticket instead of going to the matinée. Not that I think the movie was even worth $6.50.I don't blame the actors, since I've seen Hudson and McCounaghy in movies that I really enjoyed, where I thought they were top-notch. I blame the writing and the directing. A major overhaul of both would have saved this movie.Obviously this movie was supposed to be light and fluffy, and I certainly don't expect ""light and fluffy"" movies to be Oscar-worthy. But I do expect them to be entertaining. Look at movies like ""Romancing the Stone"", and ""You've Got Mail."" Sure, they're fluffy, but they're not retarded. They're entertaining movies that reasonably intelligent people can sit back on the couch and enjoy with a glass of wine and a plate of lasagna on a Sunday night, and not feel like they've just sacrificed several hundred brain cells.""Fool's Gold"" was not even entertaining, and to me, that's it's biggest flaw.",Fool's Gold

Along the way, they pick up new friends to join in on their adventure, the hero makes up with his mentor, and the bad guys are given what they deserve.

159,mikaela-ezzell,Review for English Class,7,18 February 2014,"What the 2008 romantic comedy Fool's Gold lack in originality, it makes up for with its star-studded cast and heartwarming, however cliché, story line. With the big names of Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, who had previously won over a nation with their portrayals in the 2003 hit romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, this movie would join the list of feel-good date night movies directed by Andy Tennant, such as the movies Sweet Home Alabama (2002), Hitch (2001), and more recently The Bounty Hunter (2010). Set on various tropical islands, the story of a recently divorced couple setting out on an adventure to try to find a lost treasure and finding their lost love along the way; Fool's Gold gave viewers a welcome escape from the dreary world of February in the US when it was released. The comedic elements, like the scene when Fin, McConaughey, is almost blown up and is catapulted 40ft out of the water to land on the competition's nearby boat and is completely unharmed, add a light, airy feel to the film, while the adventure and action of the treasure hunt and the protagonist's continuing close encounters with their ill-meaning competitors make the film enjoyable for even the most devoted of action film fans. While many argue that the film is completely unoriginal and riddled with cliché, there is still something to be said for giving people what they like and what they, which is a feel-good romantic, comedic, adventure. The first half of the movie is the set up for what becomes the hunt for a sunken Spanish treasure fleet. Fin, McConaughey, and Tess, Hudson, get divorced and through their arguments we learn a little about their past and also their passion for treasure hunting. When Fin runs into trouble with some debt, the added element of urgency surrounding the hunt is perfectly timed; treasure hunts can never just go as planned after all. Various other plot points add to the tense need for their ventures to be successful, such as Fin's shady deal with his debtors and an old friend-turned-rival trying to beat them to the treasure. With sword fights, planes crashing, and boats exploding, the special effects also don't disappoint on their believability and keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. Amidst all the added excitement and drama of the treasure hunt, Fin and Tess manage to reconcile some of their differences and come together again on the one thing that they both love, the thing that brought them together in the first place: treasure hunting. Hudson and McConaughey's obvious chemistry and convincing portrayal of their character's emotions and changing attitudes throughout their adventures make the characters come alive and pull the viewer into the story as only great actors can. Overall, the cohesion of the film and the introductions of all the different elements are perfectly timed throughout to create a nice blend of emotions in the viewers and keep the attention of the whiniest kids or sleepiest elders. Good movies come from good plots, good acting, and good direction, and that is exactly what this movie achieved. An instant classic for date nights and slumber parties, Fool's Gold has a little bit of something for everyone to enjoy. Continuing to follow his favorite recipe time and time again, I suspect this is not the last or greatest feel-good, romantic, comedic, adventurous date night film we have seen out of director Andy Tennant.",Fool's Gold

'You Ukrainian sidekick,' Ewen Bremner lumbers, ""I would describe more as banana,,,
and cream."" Just right.Other golden spots are - the burning boat, the plate, Finn's Vangor kingdom fist-size diamond & emerald treasure mystery story-telling -- and all the lucious scuba diving to follow ... could watch that all day.

The yacht staff, the tropical rains & Pelican Bar night, the beach treasure hunt, the romantic discovery of the secret of the lost Queen's Dowry at the church .. and of course - the gold. All of that magnificent gold, gold, gold!The few week points of Fool's Gold are not enough to bring the stars down on this madcap adventure .. the nonsensical crying mascara monolog, the Bigbunny character wasted the great comedic talent of Kevin Hart, Tess' silly dinner plate smashing, (she wouldn't do that), the actor who played Cosby son, sorry, weak. Shooting the henchman was unnecessary gratuitious violence, the unpleasant animous of bar night conversation .. and the underwater chains & church basement scenes went a little long. But wanted more of those fun group photos that told more story, more museum, (hey Ray Winstone don't break the 4th wall please), and more of what happened post-treasure..
to perfect the abrupt ending.Fool's Gold is good. Any negative reviews are foolish .. they are not from an entertainment perspective. . which is ultimately what movies are for. (Yes, Sophie's Choice & Schindler's list, for example, are glorious 5star cinema..I fully agree..but I only want to watch 'em once.)Fool's Gold will be a joyful 'Precious Gemm,' (inside joke, watch the movie), on any hot sultry summer Saturday .. forever. #",Fool's Gold
162,enli101,Balmy Escapism from the Winter Doldrums? Let's See,5,17 February 2008,"""Fools Gold"" centers on an almost divorced, or newly divorced, or still madly-in-love couple (all 3 apply) searching for Spanish treasure that was sunk in a hurricane in 1715. Does the movie succeed as balmy escapism from the winter doldrums? Let's seeIs there action?: Yes, the action was there, fun at parts, but broken up by a lot of talking that really didn't advance the plot, but worked well to confuse it (I mean a lot of talking). There was also the sound of crickets chirping that at some points was so loud it drowned out the dialogue. On purpose perhaps?Did the actors have chemistry?: Yes, in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" they did. However, both Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson are likable enough off-screen and in other films that you want to root for them, despite the flaws of this film.How 'bout the location?: I was never quite sure where the story was supposed to be set. The real 1715 fleet went down off the Eastern coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral. At one point in the movie they said they were in Key West, but I've been there enough times to know that those mountainous islands in the distance weren't anywhere near Duval Street. The movie ""The Deep,"" which also involved treasure hunters searching for the 1715 treasure, also suffered from a lack of appreciation of history, setting the wreck in Bermuda. But who can complain when you have a salty Robert Shaw and Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt?Funny?: The laughs were few and far between. Theo Huxtable from ""The Cosby Show"" was one of the baddies, and I think his pal in the film might have been Cockroach (no word on whether or not their knowledge of the 1715 treasure was based on ""Cleland Notes""). I remember laughing at parts, and then waiting to laugh again, and I was still waiting when the lights came up and the usher rolled a trashcan in. I was still waiting when I got in my car. I'm still waiting.All bad?: What the movie does well is gets you out of the cold for a couple hours. There were picturesque vistas of the tropics, girls in bikinis, palm trees blowing in the breeze, and Bob Marley music in the background. You may fool yourself for a moment into believing that you're actually in the Caribbean, if you sneak in a Pina Colada or two, or three.Post Script: If you want to read a real thrilling, funny, and sexy adventure story about treasure hunting for the 1715 fleet, try reading Tom Ryan's novel ""A Sword for Pizarro.""",Fool's Gold
