Gym teacher Mark Harmon had the same attitude toward teaching, summers free. But when director Carl Reiner wins a lottery he who was stuck with teaching remedial English he says goodbye to the profession and this southern California high school needs a Summer School teacher.And it's Harmon who lands the assignment because he still hasn't got his tenure and because he wasn't fast enough out of the parking lot. It's unanimous that these underachieving kids as well as the teacher don't want to be in class for July and August.Stuck with it they are though. These kids are quite the collection, ranging from a pair of brain dead fans of slasher flicks, to a pregnant girl, to a kid who sleeps all day in class, to an athlete who thinks football is all there is in life. There's even a foreign exchange student from Italy who just wants to improve her English a bit before regular school starts.School psychologist Kirstie Alley is there who Vice Principal Robin Thomas is putting the moves on. He's also the one who stuck Harmon in Summer School. As Alley shows more interest in Harmon he looks to sabotage him.It wouldn't seem possible, but Harmon actually learns to care for his charges and is genuinely interested in them improving their literacy skills.Although this film is a comedy it also has a subtle message against illiteracy. I was once involved with someone who was unable to read beyond a second grade level and he faked getting by in his short life. It's a terrible prison the mind is put in.I have to say that Dean Cameron and Gary Riley who seem to be a harbinger of Bill&Ted were quite funny as the lunkheads who like slasher flicks. The greatest film ever made according to them is The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Harmon shows it in class to get their attention. Summer School is an enjoyable view by a comedy master Carl Reiner.",Summer School
1,SnoopyStyle,fun and charming,8,2 November 2015,"Phys-ed teacher Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) is set to leave for Hawaiian vacation when he's forced to teach the remedial English summer school. He's even less motivated than the students. The class includes flirty Pam (Courtney Thorne-Smith), sleepy Larry (Ken Olandt), football jock Kevin (Patrick Labyorteaux), pregnant Rhonda (Shawnee Smith), geek Alan (Richard Steven Horvitz), sassy Denise (Kelly Jo Minter), giant black guy Jerome (Duane Davis), Italian transfer student Anna-Maria (Fabiana Udenio), horror fanatics Dave (Gary Riley) and Francis aka 'Chainsaw' (Dean Cameron). Mr. Shoop keeps flirting with fellow teacher Robin Bishop (Kirstie Alley) who is actually dating Vice Principal Phil Gills (Robin Thomas).I love this movie and I don't care if it's critically panned. It's charming light fun with a little dig at the education system. I love all the characters. The kids are a fun group. Mark Harmon is perfect as a laid-back teacher. I think some critics are looking for something edgy from director Carl Reiner. These are slacker characters who find their inner voices. These are fun nice characters.",Summer School
2,claudio_carvalho,Funny and Entertaining,7,28 April 2020,"When the summer vacation comes, the gym teacher Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) is ready to travel to Hawaii with his girlfriend. However, he assigned by Vice Principal Phil Gills (Robin Thomas) to give English classes in summer to undisciplined and mediocre high-school students. When Phil promises to fire Freddy unless his students pass the test, he agrees to grant a wish from each student if they study the English lessons he prepares with the support of the history teacher Ms. Robin Elizabeth Bishop (Kirstie Alley).""Summer School"" is a funny and entertaining comedy from the 80´s and underrated by professional critics. This movie certainly would never be an Oscar nominated but it is hilarious and makes the viewer laugh. Mark Harmon´s procedures and deal with the class is very funny and Kirstie Alley and Courtney Thorne-Smith very beautiful. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Curso de Verão"" (""Summer School"")",Summer School
3,gavin6942,A Perfect Blend of Comedy,8,12 May 2017,"A high-school gym teacher has big plans for the summer, but is forced to cancel them to teach a ""bonehead"" English class for misfit goof-off students. Fortunately, his unconventional brand of teaching fun field trips begins to connect with them, and even inspires ardor in some.If I am not mistaken, this is from the creator of ""Full House"". At least, that's what I think of when I hear ""Jeff Franklin"". And it certainly has some of that sitcom type humor about it, as this film is obviously not set in a reality I have been a part of.Interestingly, I was directed to the movie by Rue Morgue magazine, which is for horror films. And they were not wrong to point me -- the love of ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is evident, along with a few great effects shots, the praise for Rick Baker, the casting of Shawnee Smith (even if she was not yet a horror queen). Heck, even a score from Danny Elfman, who I more typically think of as Tim Burton's guy, even though he's really worked with just about everyone by now.",Summer School
4,BandSAboutMovies,Enjoyable,7,5 May 2020,"Wondering why Summer School is still funny 33 years later and a lot of these Police Academy-style movies are dated? It was directed by Carl Reiner, who knows funny.It was written by Jeff Franklin, who was also behind Just One of the Guys and created Full House and its Netflix spin-off Fuller House, which he was removed from after #metoo complaints. Oddly enough, he owned 10050 Cielo Drive, which he demolished and replaced with a new house before listing it for sale in 2019.Phys Ed teacher Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) just wants school to be over so that he can go to Hawaii, but when Mr. Dearadorian (Reiner) retires, he gets stuck teaching summer school.He's left with the worst kids in school for the best time of being a teacher, which would be summer vacation. There's Pam (a pre-Melrose Place Courtney Thorne-Smith), male exotic dancer Larry (Ken Olandt, syndicated series Super Force); Kevin the jock (Patrick Labyorteaux brother to Matthew), pregnant Rhonda (Shawnee Smith, The Blob), Alan the nerd (Richard Steven Horvitz, the voice of Alpha 5 in Power Rangers), Jerome (Duane Davis, who was in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master), exchange student Anna-Maria (Fabiana Udenio, Alotta Fagina from Austin Powers), Denise (Kelly Jo Minter, Maria from The Lost Boys) and horror film lovers Dave (Gary Riley, Charlie from Stand by Me) and Chainsaw, who is played by Dean Cameron, who this horror-obsessed fan knows was Ralph in Bad Dreams and Ralph the vampire in Rockula.Will Freddy get Robin the history teacher (Kirstie Alley) to fall for him? Will the kids all graduate? Will there be an extended viewing of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Will hijinks, as I always say, ensue?Of course.This is the only Danny Elfman soundtrack that has never been released. There's also E.G. Daily's ""Mind Over Matter,"" which was originally a Debbie Harry song that she recorded and had some success with.Ah man. More people should know about this movie. Here's hoping that my little write-up convinces you to give it a chance.",Summer School
5,michaelRokeefe,What a crazy summer.,4,15 March 2003,"Being directed by Carl Reiner does not always mean an automatic hit. This is a typical high school flick with the usual teacher(Mark Harmon)that does not want to be there. Add in the misfit students that damn sure don't want to be in summer school. Somehow the ""teach"" hones in on the right wave length and actually gets the students to learn. Of course there has to be a love interest and it is Kirstie Alley looking probably her best. Goofy and off beat. No great shakes. Also in the cast are Robin Thomas, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Dean Cameron and the hot Shawnee Smith.",Summer School

7,Scarecrow-88,Summer School,7,2 December 2016,"Spirited, fun-loving gym coach (Mark Harmon, never more charming or high energy) is saddled with high school kids stuck in summer school due to terrible grades in English, needing to get them to pass a test at the end so he can reach tenure. While the vice principal (a well cast stick-in-the-mud Robin Thomas) doubts Harmon can do it, the kids, through bribing (Harmon agrees to grant them favors if they will allow him to teach them English!), start to actually study and learn progressively. Meanwhile Harmon continues to ask fellow teacher Kirstie Alley (never more yummy) out on a date, unimpeded by her constant rejection towards him.An electric cast of familiar faces in young roles, a splendid sunny coastal setting, sense of humor that aims to please, breezy direction that makes the most of the formula plot, and some delightful homages to the slasher films of the 80s (this was around '87 as slasher films were riding the high soon to wane in the next few years) really keep the film appealing. It is a cult comedy that is anchored (and boosted) by Harmon's winning personality (he is mostly known as a dramatic actor with more effort toward intensity and sincerity which makes this character a welcome change of pace for him) with memorable duo of horror make-up aficionados, Chainsaw and Dave (Dean Cameron and Gary Riley, quite a pair), leaving a zany impression. But the cast is filled with faces those who grew up with television and movies in the 80s and 90s know: Patrick Labyorteaux (Little House on the Prairie; Heathers; Ghoulies III: JAG) as football player needing to lift his grades to make the team, Courtney Thorne-Smith (Melrose Place; Ally McBeal) as teenage surfer infatuated with Harmon, Kelly Jo Minter (after this she was in both The Lost Boys and A Nightmare on Elm Street 5) as dyslexic student trying to get her driver's license, Ken Olandt (April Fool's Day was right before this and he also starred in Leprechaun a few years later) as underage stripper who sleeps during summer class, Shawnee Smith (Saw; Who's Harry Crumb?) as pregnant teenager Labyorteaux takes a shine to, Richard Steven Horvitz as allergy-plagued dork who is burdened with being the black sheep in terms of not passing class (he has made a career as a voice artist), foxy foreign exchange student Fabiana Udenio who eventually strips to bikini and is an object of lust for the horror film geeks to drool over, and hulking Duane Davis who goes to the bathroom on the first day and returns the last to take the test (and passes with the highest grade!).Memorable scenes include the cast frightening a sub for Harmon with a splatter scene right out of a Freddy movie (the make-up effects are epic!), Harmon losing his girlfriend to a Hawaii trip as he must stay behind in order to remain employed, fireworks setting Harmon's couch on fire during a party at his house, Harmon's early teaching methods (which included field trips to an amusement park and the library), the summer school ending exams which had all the students rushing to just finish them, and the driver's exams where Cameron and Minter have their share of problems. Harmon and Alley have good chemistry, and his efforts finally pay off at the end...and how Harmon tries to disable Courtney's crush on him comes with some complications. Harmon's simply infectious, and NCIS fans might want to take a look at this to see a more laid-back and easy-breezy personality quite different from the rock of Gibraltar he inhabits on the long-time military action show.",Summer School
8,Hey_Sweden,I give it two thumbs up.,7,30 July 2014,"Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) is an easygoing Phys. Ed. instructor who has big plans for the summer, intending to travel to Hawaii with his girlfriend. But he ends up roped into teaching remedial English to a group of delinquent kids instead. Initially he's as reluctant to be in a classroom for the summer as they are, and they have a wacky series of ""field trips"" before he realizes that these kids aren't really that dumb, and he begins to take the assignment seriously - and manages to inspire them to do their best.This very likable comedy holds up pretty well 27 years later, with a first rate cast creating an engaging and memorable set of characters. Harmon does well in his first starring vehicle; he COULD have just coasted through this thing on his looks and charisma, but he shows a nice comic ability as well. Kirstie Alley is endearing as the teacher whom he persistently tries to win over, and Robin Thomas Grossman is just right as the nemesis character (the uptight vice principal of the school) who you enjoy booing all the way through the thing.The two best characters, certainly for a horror fan such as this viewer, are the laid back Francis ""Chainsaw"" Gremp (so nicknamed because of his love for Tobe Hoopers' ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre""), played by Dean Cameron, and his friend Dave (Gary Riley). Their love of gore climaxes in a truly fun moment as the students scare away a substitute teacher with a classroom full of splatter; naturally, a viewing of the Hooper classic occurs along the way. The other kids include football player Kevin (Patrick Labyorteaux), surfer Pam (Courtney Thorne- Smith), the dyslexic Denise (Kelly Jo Minter), underage male stripper Larry (Ken Olandt), pregnant Rhonda (Shawnee Smith), nerdy Alan (Richard Steven Horvitz), and luscious Italian exchange student Anna-Maria (Fabiana Udenio). Director Carl Reiner, who'd previously done another seasonal comedy, ""Summer Rental"" with John Candy, has a cameo early in the movie. Amy Stock (the ""Bill & Ted"" movies), Laura Waterbury (""Better Off Dead""), and Duane Davis (""Beetlejuice"") all have small roles.""Summer School"" sometimes get silly, but never goes overboard in that regard. It remains an upbeat and watchable story from start to finish, with some serious (but not too serious) moments, and it follows the formula of ""misfits make good"" stories pretty well. The soundtrack also helps to add to the good vibes.Seven out of 10.",Summer School
9,neil-476,I am out of step,7,15 June 2011,"Summer School is a pleasant teen comedy about a teacher who is forced to take a summer school class of slackers who have screwed up their last school year. They don't want to be there, he doesn't want to be there, they try to get out of it, he tries to chat up another teacher....It is gentle, routine stuff. Mark Harmon does well, as does most of the cast.For me, the movie is spoiled by Dean Cameron, who lent his never-funny presence to a number of raunchy-ish comedies in the nineties. He seems to have a vocal fan base who love what he does here: I have to say that I didn't. And don't. And ditto everything else I have ever seen him in (and as someone who rented a lot of videos in the nineties, I have seen him in a lot of movies!).",Summer School
10,FlashCallahan,Somebody call the school nurse.....,6,30 November 2013,"A high-school gym teacher has big plans for the summer, but is forced to cancel them to teach an English class for misfit goof-off students. Fortunately, his unconventional brand of teaching fun field trips begins to connect with them, and even inspires ardor in some....Its dead potheads society, Sister Act 2: Back on the the habit, and Kindergaten Cop for stoners. Basically its your generic tale where the rough teacher with a heart of gold, has one last chance to prove himself, but has the hardest rag tag bunch of kids who have no respect for no one.Of course, the teacher fancies the female teacher next door, but she's involved with the one who wants rid of said teacher, but you know she isn't interested in Nasty teacher.Things are looking good, but something bad happens, and it looks like the end.But obviously we have seen so many of these films, that we are just going through the motions until the predictable finale that we've been expecting.Its nothing new, nothing special, but its watchable, and ticks all the right boxes, and presses all the right buttons when needed, plus it has the added bonus of Dean Cameron, who has the most amazing eyebrows ever.And for a film like this. The special effects are very good .",Summer School
11,Wuchakk,Goodhearted high school comedy,6,10 November 2013,"""Summer School"" (1987) is a solid mid-80s teen dramedy in the tradition of 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", 1985's ""Just One of the Guys"" and many others. Although it's no where near as good as ""Fast Times"" -- since that's the pick of the litter -- it's still a solid high school comedy-drama.Likable Mark Harmon plays a hip gym teacher, Shoop, who gets stuck teaching remedial English in Summer School. His students don't want to be there and neither does he, but at some point he develops fatherly concern for the kids. Meanwhile, Kirstie Alley plays another teacher at Summer School who catches Shoop's eye. Can Shoop get these kids to learn? The first act plays out in a fairly leisurely, languid manner, but somewhat amusing. It wasn't until around the mid-point of the movie that I really started to see Shoop's goodheartedness. Yes, he's a bit too irresponsible to be an effective teacher, but he makes up for it in that he cares about the kids and they, in turn, begin to care about him, and care about learning too.The group of teens consist of a jock, a stud, two horror film geeks, a prego girl, a cute blond, a hot foreign student, a nerd, a spirited Hispanic and a token black dude. It's to the film's credit that quite a few of these characters -- mostly rebels of one sort or another -- are fleshed-out enough that you begin seeing them as real people and actually like them. Take, for instance, the brief subplot about the jock and the prego girl. It's surprising touches like this that lift ""Summer School"" from mediocrity.Although Fabiana Udenio -- the foreign babe -- is certainly beautiful, Courtney Thorne-Smith steals her thunder as the cute blond, Pam. Speaking of Pam, there's a subplot that shows the naiveté and goodheartedness of Shoop when Pam asks to stay at his place. Anyone with a brain could see that Pam has the hots for him, but Shoop just sees her as a student in need and innocently allows her to (temporarily) stay. Alley's character, however, sees the obvious problems of the situation and opens Shoop's eyes.The reason I'm not giving ""Summer School"" a very high rating is because I don't want to mislead people into thinking that it's better than what it is. It's a second-tier 80s teen dramedy, but it's solid if you can handle the laid-back vibe and sometimes amateurish editing. What makes it so likable is its mid-80's soundtrack, warmheartedness and lack of raunch.The film was shot in the greater Los Angeles area and runs 97 minutes.Grade: B-",Summer School
12,inkblot11,"No one will hate attending this summer school, it rocks!",8,18 July 2012,"Gym teacher Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) is watching the clock as the last day of school wanes. He and his beautiful young girlfriend are going to Hawaii on an extended vacation. But, alas, an instructor (Carl Reiner, who also directed this laughfest) scratches off 50 big ones on a lottery ticket and informs the principals that he won't be teaching summer school after all. This bombshell arrives when teachers are getting in their cars and driving out of the parking lot. Vice Principal Gill (Robin Thomas) manages to corral ONE teacher only in the lot, Freddy. Using some direct manipulation as to Mr. Shoop's future employment, Gill forces Freddy to stay and teach remedial English. Horrors! On the first day of the summer session, Freddy is not surprised that none of his students want to listen to him and that teaching them anything will be a challenge. However, next door, there is a very pretty new teach, Robin (Kirstie Alley), who has an honors history class. Although she is quite friendly, Robin is reluctant to accept Freddy's obvious attentions. This is because, Shoop learns, she has begun dating Gill. Horrors again! Willing to try anything to get out of actual teaching, Freddy takes his class on field trips to amusement parks and petting farms. Naturally, this almost gets him fired so Shoop makes a deal with Gill. IF he gets all of his students to pass the final examination, he can keep his job. With students like Chainsaw, a goof-off, Larry, an exotic dancer by night and a dozer by day, and a dyslectic young lady, will Freddy make it happen? This is a fun film, perfect for rainy days during summer vacation for teens. Yes, there is some objectionable material involving bad language and sexual innuendo that will not please all viewers. But, there's lot of humor, too, and a wonderful soundtrack that keeps the energy flowing. The cast is very nice, too, with Harmon doing a great slacker-teacher turn and the rest keeping pace. Especially fine are the young, teenage thespians who light up the screen. Of course, the setting in California is also gorgeous, while costumes, photography, and dialogue go beyond typical youth-oriented material. In short, you should sign up for this summer school. It will not remotely make you miserable.",Summer School

14,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: High school teen comedies!,7,31 January 2005,"Summer School (1987) was one of the many high school teen movies that were revived during the 80's. Unlike most of them this wasn't as exploitive or filled with gratuitous nudity or really foul language. The movie has become a cable t.v. staple and found an audience on video as well.The movie follows a bunch of misfits who failed to pass a basic high school English equivalence test. A gym coach (Mark Harmon) is given the unwanted assignment of teaching English over the summer. The cast is filled with several stars of the 80's (Dean Cameron, Kristy Alley, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kelly Jo Minter and Shawnee Smith to name a few).Not a classic by any means but a fun time killer and you'll be entertained.

16,philip_vanderveken,"Not intelligent, but it brings some sunshine on a rainy afternoon.",6,27 July 2005,"""Summer School"" is a typical Carl Reiner movie. It's certainly not the most intelligent movie ever, but it's one of those movies that are excellent to watch on a rainy afternoon during the summer time. And even though it's not the most original comedy either, it still makes you laugh a couple of times. Even better is that it gets you in the right holiday spirit with all the pretty girls, the beaches, the sun,...The movie starts at the end of the school year. All the teachers are eager to go on vacation. The high-school gym teacher Freddy Shoop is one of them. He has planned his vacation on Hawaii with his girlfriend, but the school direction decides otherwise. He'll have to teach the summer remedial English class to anti-social underachievers. He doesn't want to be in that class room and neither do the students. That's why he decided to go on 'field trips' with them. They'll go to the beach, a petting zoo and the amusement park - so not exactly the most educational places - as long as he doesn't have to teach them and they don't have to learn anything. But when he is told that he will lose his job when the students don't pass their tests at the end of the summer, he radically changes his way of thinking. At first the students are very sceptical, but when he comes to an interesting agreement with them, he can motivate them to study for the very first time in their lives...If you are looking for a somewhat intelligent comedy, then I suggest you don't watch this one, because you'll be incredibly annoyed by it. Don't even think that you will be spared of at least one stereotype. You'll find them all in this all too typical high school comedy. Does that mean that this is an awful movie? No, not really. As long as you don't expect too much of it, you'll be able to like it. The acting for instance could have been a lot worse and there are enough funny moments to keep the movie interesting enough.It may not be the best movie ever, but as some easy entertainment, this movie certainly did its job. I've seen a lot worse already and that's why I give this typical teenage comedy a 6.5/10.",Summer School

19,thejcowboy22,Ready for another session of Summer School,7,29 July 2016,"In 1969 I had a great summer despite my fractured thumb. The Mets were in a pennant race, First Man on the moon, WMHA summer day camp was even enjoyable with it's countless field trips. The summer of 1970 was a different story as I was required to go to Summer School for the first time for Math. From 8:30 -10 Monday through Friday. I didn't care for the teacher either as my classmates were at the bottom 10% of the my grade. Not the studious types to say the least. When I arrived home My mother wasn't very pleasant either . She was mad that I was home and not in a structured Camp. Being of age I understand the need for space and having me around wasn't emotionally helpful as far as Mom was concerned. There were a few more Moon missions with little fan fare and the Mets were mediocre at best. Just a total reverse of the prior year. The laid back slacker of a Physical Ed teacher Mr.Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon)is really looking forward to his summer recess. In anticipation of spending his time in Hawaii with his lovely girlfriend, Shoop and his class watch the gymnasium scoreboard clock as they count down the the seconds to the final bell. Meanwhile in another part of the building a determined Mr. Dearadorian, English teacher, (DIRECTOR/ACTOR)Carl Reiner is rubbing scratch offs from the roll of California lottery tickets he purchase in hopes of winning his way out of his lousy job as Summer School Teacher. Our elated and exasperated English professor looks in shock as he realizes that he has won the big money prize and tells his boss good bye and runs off leaving the lone teacher poor Mr.Shoop holding the proverbial ball. No vacation, no Hawaii, just long days in the classroom teaching remedial English to a bunch of the strangest group of students you'll ever try to teach. From a hay fevered nerd Alan, Pregnant Rhonda,Larry the Chippendale dancer,Anna Maria Italian Beauty Queen, Dyslexic Denise and Wannabee House guest of Mr. Shoop Pam. The two stand out characters in this whole movie are students Francis Chainsaw (Dean Cameron) and his side kick Dave (Gary Reilly). With their array of disgusting props and viewing of their favorite Movie the Texas Chainsaw Massacre those two bring classroom participation to a comedic fever pitch. Shoop is basically clueless in teaching English and asks for Neighboring teacher (A SLENDER Miss Robin Bishop) Kirsty Alley for help on how to teach.At first Robin is standoffish due to the fact that she's dating cutthroat Assistant Vice principal Phil Gills(Robin Thomas) but Mark Harmon gives the Shoop character a special endearing charm and despite his transitional methods of teaching, he takes his misfits students to the beach, petting zoo and viewing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Shoop is so taken in by his class that he makes deals with them by helping Denise with her driving exam,working with Larry at his football skills Lamaze coach for a pregnant Rhonda (Shawnee Smith) and hosting a party at his beachfront home for his rowdy pupils. The summer moves swiftly as the goal here is getting these kids ready for the English remedial exam. Just when it looks like all is lost as Mr. Shoop feels he's been taken advantage of because his Students over time didn't live up to their end of the bargain. Shoop storms out of his class, quits and the antics of his students rise to a higher level of comedy.You won't be disappointed in the outcome. Great period piece with no shortage of comedy but make sure you bring back the pass you used to go to the bathroom. I rate this movie 7 teacher's apples here!",Summer School

21,ab-2,"I went in with bad expectations, and came out quite surprised how funny and enjoyable this movie was",9,27 August 2005,"I have never been a fan of teen comedies for many reasons that I can't possibly list here. Most are menial, mediocre movies that have little or no effort put into them and usually just fall down the pits into low brow comedy including but not limited to scatological humor and/or perverse sexual jokes. Am I saying all comedies of this nature are like that? No, absolutely not. I really enjoyed ""American Wedding"". Though there are others like ""The New Guy"" that are just plain awful. While ""Summer School"" has nothing to offer the film medium in terms of new stuff, it manages to be an enjoyable romp.The story concerns a gym teacher, who goes by the name ""Shoop"" (Mark Harmon). School has ended for summer vacation and students and teachers alike are eager to get out. The exception is for the teachers who have to teach the summer school students. When the original English teacher supposed to teach the summer school students bails out, the Vice Principal (Robin Thomas), puts Shoop on the job. If all goes well, Shoop will get tenure. But considering the type of kids Shoop will have to deal it, it will be a long road ahead. Shoop also strikes an unsuccessful string of dates with another summer school teacher, Ms. Bishop (Kristie Alley). Will Shoop be able to get the kids to study and not only get a date with Ms. Bishop? It's one of the hardest to things to review a film that is good, but offers little in being able to be discussed. The actors overall seem to be having a fun time with the characters they portray. They aren't dull for a moment and everyone brings they're own amounts of energy to the roles they play. Mark Harmon in particular has not only a lot of energy, but has charisma that helps to add to his characters enjoyable nature. This not only helps with his on-screen chemistry with Kristie Alley's character. They play well off one another in key scenes very well, and are overall fun to watch. Robin Thomas also does well as the stereotypical evil principal.The comedy works for the most part in this movie because it deals with clichés and stereotypes, and plays exactly off of both. The students all have ""Breakfast Club-like"" stereotypes including a jock, nerd, losers, and outcasts. The writers and director Carl Reiner seem to enjoy these clichés and go far to make them funny, but not crossing that edge into annoyance and stupidity. All of this culminates into somewhat of a non-stereotypical which satisfied me and partly surprised me, which I'd prefer not to give away as it help adds more to this funny movie.Overall, if you just want to see a movie that you know you will have a goodtime at, ""Summer School"" might just be the selection for. Just don't go in any with any expectations. I went in with bad and came out with good. As Alfred Hitchcock would say ""It's only a movie.""",Summer School
22,rms125a,NICE BLAST FROM THE PAST,7,20 January 2019,"Wonderfully sweet. Mark Harmon, the Tom Brady of thespians, never fails to amaze, whether retroactively from several generations ago (as Ted Bundy in ""The Deliberate Stranger"") or in present time (""NCIS""), albeit almost always in more intense and far more serious fare. This film is whipped cream, a very far cry from Ted Bundy (the mass murdering sociopath whom Harmon portrayed to critical acclaim just a year earlier, in 1986) and equally far from the severe icy cobalt blue-eyed Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs of ""NCIS"" fame, the role with which Harmon will likely be (fairly or otherwise) best-known and associated with, but a briefly blissful return to a far more innocent and, arguably (and certainly for me), happier, time. It was directed, adequately, by Carl Reiner, who has a small, not all that funny, role at the beginning of the film as the veteran teacher originally scheduled to teach summer school until he wins $50,000 in the lottery and backs out, thus setting the crux of the film in motion.Harmon, looking occasionally a bit like a taller Tom Cruise, is sweet, funny, and appealing as naive Los Angeles jock gym teacher Freddy Shoop who, having a trip planned to Hawaii with his girlfriend, Kim (who goes without him), is forced to teach ""Remedial English"" to a bunch of mostly smart but lazy ""Welcome Back Kotter""-type (but better looking) students or face being fired or denied tenured by the snarky, two-faced ambitious assistant principal (played by Robin Thomas, who manages to make the character more than tolerably comprehensible, amusing, and even sympathetic at times until his sleazery hits its apex at the finale), with whom Shoop, of course, is eventually (fairly soon, really) in (successful) competition for the same woman, history teacher Robin Bishop (lovely Kirstie Alley, two months before her first appearance in the increasingly unfunny and juvenile second-half of ""Cheers"" overlong run, and before the lamentably not-much-better ""Veronica's Closet"").Shawnee Smith (""Becker"", ""Anger Management""), as an almost-due pregnant student who needs a Lamaze coach, is unrecognizable except for her voice. Other students include a trim pre-""JAG"" Patrick Labortyeaux, reliably sexy sloe-eyed Ken Olandt as a Chippendales-style adult dancer who is (understandably) always asleep during class (he works nights until his mother and aunt mistakenly patronize him and he loses his job for being underaged), and a pre-""Melrose Place"", ""Ally McBeal"", ""According to Jim"", and ""Two and a Half Men"" Courtney Thorne-Smith, who gets some gravitas as a student who falls for Shoop and even moves in with him briefly when she is without a place to stay but this is a bit dicey since the character is only 16 years old and vulnerable; Alley's character gets Harmon to see the folly in this act of poorly-judged kindness.The obsession by two comedically close male students (Dean Cameron and Gary Riley, neither of whom I had heard of before, as a Wayne and Garth type duo) with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which they get Mr. Shoop to screen in class, is a little bit of an inside joke as several of the actors appeared in numerous equally gory and scary horror flicks, such as Shawnee Smith (""Saw"" franchise), Kelly Jo Minter (""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"" and ""The People Under the Stairs""), and Beau Starr (""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"", ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"", and ""Masters of Horror"").",Summer School
23,jbartelone,One of The Best 80's Teen Movies!,8,23 September 2007,"There are few teen movies that I really get into. One is The Breakfast Club for its poignant portrayal of stereotyped high school students. The other is Summer School, because it is fresh, funny, and fun, every time I watch it.The format is predictable. In Summer School we have Freddy Shoop, a slacker gym teacher who longs for summer vacations, so that he doesn't have to teach! Mr. Shoop is up for tenure. Therefore, when the original Remedial English teacher wins a lottery, the dead-pan, strict, vice principle Mr. Gills is forced to hire Mr. Shoop as his replacement.The fun begins with trips to such places as amusement parks and petting zoos! But when a student's grandmother discovers that her grandson came home from an allergy attack from the animals, she marches into Mr. Gill's office demanding that the field trips stop and the education begins.Gills initially suspends Mr. Shoop for this. But Shoop asks, ""What if I become a model teacher?"" Gills blackmails him into keeping his job. He must get all of the students in his class to pass the English Proficiency test by the end of the term, or he loses not only his tenure, but also his job.Mr Shoop's students are smarter than they are given credit for. Most of the kids have fine potential, but are lazy to get their work done. Mr. Shoop bribes them by granting a favor to each student in exchange for them to show up, make an effort, and study for the proficiency test.I suppose the sticking part of this movie is why the students should have to be bribed to want to learn? However, it is a plus how Shoop begins to believe in the kids and gets them to instill confidence in themselves. In this type of movie, there are several ""set backs"" along the way as expected. But in the end, despite the student's average scores being below a 70%, (And the average scores of the students incidentally are NOT correct when you calculate the number of students whose scores are announced at the film's conclusion! The producers forget to do some basic math homework!) The head principle over-rides Gills' recommendation that Mr. Shoop be fired based on the improvements from the pre-test scores to post test scores and grants Mr. Shoop's tenure.One can not expect a serious motivational movie such as Lean on Me or Stand and Deliver from this. However, Summer School has a pleasant comic element without disintegrating into slapstick. Mark Harmon is great as the teacher and two stand out performances are the actors who play ""Chainsaw"" and ""Dave"" who are the human equivalent of ""Beavis and Butthead!"" For parents, there is some gross ""special effects violence"" when the kids recreate a scene from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which gives the film a PG-13 rating. (Some commercial TV/standard cable stations edit out this scene completely.) There are maybe one or two swear words in the film, but nothing really objectionable for a young teen crowd.A very entertaining movie and fine repeated viewing for most teens and their families. I recommend that everyone attend ""Summer School!"" You'll have a great time!",Summer School

Party all-the-time!This film really is as cool as everyone says. Dated 80's stuff doesn't get in the way of great characters and sharp wit. If you've not seen it yet, rent it & marvel at the goriest sequence in a high school comedy ever - these people are PSYCHOPATHS !Particular favs of mine are the 'I don't know anything' dream gag, the Rick Baker essay sequence and the 'War puts a man through many, many changes' gag from Dave. Top stuff.9/10",Summer School
25,shneur,Pretty worthless except for a few chuckles,3,8 April 2006,"This is a really silly teen movie, where all the teens are well into their twenties, as usual for Hollywood. I guess it was trying to hitch a ride on the success of ""The Breakfast Club"" two years earlier, but it lacks that cult classic's poignancy and dark humor. This one, about a gym teacher shanghaied into teaching remedial English instead of going to Hawaii, has its amusing moments, but basically is entirely predictable, and the characters are so shallow it's hard to care what happens to them, even for an hour and a half. I doubt that Phys Ed teachers, who have to graduate from college just like every other teacher, and who've always seemed to me like a decent bunch of people, would much appreciate the implication that they are all dummies. Oh well... For all you J.A.G. fans, you get to see Patrick Labyorteaux a decade before he became Bud Roberts.",Summer School
26,goleafs84,Entertaining And Fun To Watch,7,13 March 2005,"This is one of those movies; If you're looking for intelligence or an Oscar worthy movie, forget it; With this movie, you won't get it. However, if you're looking for a movie where you're looking to be entertained, and laugh out loud, you've found it in this movie.The characters were a ""mixed bag"" of people from the jock who got kicked off the football team; The pregnant girl; The boy whose hormones are in overdrive; The suffer girl and of course ""Chainsaw"" and Dave; the 2 borderline psychos with warped minds, sense of humor and they love the move, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (they were my favorites). They all flunked the English skills test and have the opportunity to retake it, but they have to take a remedial English class in summer school. And then there's Freddie Shoop; The gym teacher looking for tenure, and is forced to teach these kids.What makes this movie funny, is Freddie Shoop (in addition of the above mentioned), gets in trouble with the school's Vice Principal, when he took his students on ""Field trips"" to the beach, the petting zoo, amusement parks (to name a few places). So he makes a deal with the Vice Principal; To have them all pass the English skills test; So he will be granted tenure and not be fired, while making a deal with the students; So they will study and pass as well. All this while trying to win the love and affection of a fellow summer school teacher.What makes this movie interesting now, is this movie has 7 actors who have moved on to bigger and better things. Besides the obvious, (Mark Harmon), there's Kirsty Alley, in her Pre ""Cheers"" days. Then there's Patrick Labyorteaux (Bud from ""Jag""), Ken Oldnt, Cortney Thorne-Smith, of ""Melrose Place"" and ""Ally McBeal"" fame and ""According to Jim"", Shawnee Smith (Linda, From ""Becker"")and Richard Steven Horovitz whose done many voice characterizations for various Saturday morning cartoons.Great Movie.

27,EmmeCHammer,Just a pleasant memory.....,9,23 July 2020,"In high school in the 80s was great. Fads, Music, and MTV ruled my life and also all the coming of age movies like this one. I watched it again today and all the memories of a growing teen came flooding back, the Good memories. My girlfriend worked at a Video/VCR store called West Coast Video where if you didn't have one you could rent a 30lb VCR and 3 movies for $9.99, which I paid nothing because I had someone on the inside if you get my drift. I have and have seen literally hundreds and hundreds of movies and may not think of them but will never forget them good or bad. I was scrolling the guide today and Summer School popped up and I said hell yeah. Once it started it all came back, cheesy but well made 80s teenage cinema at its best. All I could do was smile and laugh at every corny and over the top funny moment in the film. Those were the days I thought, growing up in the 80s, we have all moved on : Girlfriend (have no idea where she's at) VCRs (dinosaured) Video Store (shut down) but I'll never forget where I was and that time in my life, so this movie brings me back and I SMILE so for this reason it's a 9!!",Summer School

Things they do and say in this movie are nuts. You can actually find a now-(in)famous names in this movie, then unknown.If you are a horror\comedy fun, check this one out for sure since this movie gives some tribute to Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, since we are talking about characters who looooves horror and are experts in FX make up.This movie is OK for a family watch or watching with lot of friends\girlfriend.

29,chimera3,"Carl Reiner, Movie Magician",10,12 October 2017,"My mom introduced this movie to me and my brother and sung its praises like no other. She told us that this was done by Carl Reiner, father of the legendary Rob Reiner. Like with so many other movies that came out of the 1980's, this is one that will never be forgotten. In addition, this is a unique high school movie that will leave you in stitches because you laugh so hard. Then again, that's always been Carl's claim to fame: make you laugh so hard that you forget about a bad day.It all begins with Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon before he joined ""NCIS""), a devil-may-care gym teacher who is laser-focused on going to Hawaii for summer vacation. Then comes the principal and practically forces him to teach remedial English for summer school. There goes the summer vacation and he has to teach a motley crew of students who don't exactly have the best academic records in the world.Two of the students he has to teach are horror movie fans who know their way around special effects and the like. You also have pregnant Rhonda (Shawnee Smith before she was in ""Saw"" and just before she was in ""The Blob""), as well as a foreign exchange student and a surfer girl who likes Shoop more than a typical teacher and student should. Everyone has their own story to tell and he has to deal with it.Probably one of the best scenes in the movie is when Shoop decides to leave and the students make a stand to get him back by scaring the living daylights out of a temporary substitute with the help of their horror movie aficionado classmates, essentially scaring her off. They then go down to the beach, still in their horror movie attire, and plead to Shoop to come back. He concedes, of course, and the students eventually take a formal English test (the fill in the bubble kind, of course), proving the cynical principal wrong in so many ways.Needing a good laugh? Had a bad day? Sit down and watch ""Summer School."" It's one of the craziest comedies to ever come out of the 1980's and I guarantee you will watch it over and over again.",Summer School

This comedy is truly uplifting, so full of gags, funny lines, oddball characters with varying likes and hobbies, and not a single wrong casting choice in the bunch. Certainly, the Chainsaw theme, when used, added to the fun and aggravation of the principle's aide, even while it showed a distinct creative ability.

Mark Harmon was adorable as the drifting P.E. teacher who is roped into teaching remedial English for a summer.  His class consist of a variety of personalities who probably all could be diagnosed with ADD.  Chainsaw, played by a very under appreciated Dean Cameron, and Dave steal the show with their over the top dedication to being class clowns and slackers.

39,ptcommish,An Underrated Film,8,12 July 2001,"I'm afraid to admit it.  I really think this movie is funny.I had not seen it in a long time until I saw it just recently on TNT.  I thought it was very funny when I saw it in high school, and it still is today.  The key to the movie are Chainsaw and Dave.  These two have the majority of the memorable lines and stand-out scenes.  I laughed out loud at their antics and feel they may be two of the most underrated comedic characters in recent memory.Many of the side stories dealing with the pregnant girl, the football player and the stripper completely miss the boat.  Some of the characters are completely annoying.  But even Caddyshack had the unappealing story of Danny Noonan and his girlfriend, yet it is still a comedy classic.As a 30 year old male, the true test to a comedy film is whether or not you will quote it.  Movies like Caddyshack, Animal House, Fletch etc are quoted on a daily basis during our conversations.  Summer School is VERY quotable thanks to Chainsaw and Dave.While Summer School is not the best comedy of the 80's, it is the most unheralded.  It is laugh-out-loud funny and if you haven't seen it in a while check it out - it works.RATING 8.5/10",Summer School

But it had something that so many comedies, particularly the newer ones, don't -- heart -- what with how the main character (the under-rated Mark Harmon) and his students helped each other grow up. And it was clever and funny without being dirty or vulgar -- it has not a smidgen of the potty humor that infects more recent offerings.

In other words the class is almost full. Where did all the students go? When the ""favors"" are being passed out for the students to study, the number of students is greatly reduced. There are maybe 10 people that take the final tests.--Not counting the guy that went to the bathroom for six weeks. I looked over other reviews and nobody seems to notice the absence of the people that were there at the beginning of the movie. Also, no mention is made in the movie as to where the others went.

Chainsaw and Dave are inspired, especially the scene where they turn the classroom into a horror scene, and their faces when the exchange student doesn't quite remove her bikini top.

From the very beginning of the movie when ""Happy"" by Oingo Boingo starts playing, it definitely sets the tone for the entire movie; a summer full of adventure, excitement, homework (blah!), rebellious teens and a teacher who can turn them all around, in a very comedic and entertaining way.Summer School stars Mark Harmon as Freddie Shoop, an unambitious gym teacher who has plans to go to Hawaii with his girlfriend Kim, until the ""bite in the ***"" vice principal Gills springs summer school upon him right before he's about to leave. With a cast of misfit teens who refuse to learn, Freddie is forced to bribe them into doing their work and passing, and the hilarity begins.While a lot of the comedic aspects are somewhat cheesy (the good 80s kind), they still make you laugh and there are some touching (yet comedic) moments throughout the movie. Those of us who grew up in the 80s and/or early 90s were able to enjoy this flick while it was fresh. I think even the newer generation could enjoy this film and see what we found so entertaining about it. It has ""passion and a plucky spirit!"" If you're looking for something different, look no further! This movie will give you a few good laughs and even keep your attention until the end. Even after all of these years, I still make sure to watch this once or twice a year.

I expected to be slightly embarrassed and disappointed with it, but the years haven't taken away what made the film so appealing to me as a teenager - it has a witty, quotable script, the comic acting from all the cast is excellent and it has a real heart. It's not a great surprise to see it was directed by a comic master - Carl Reiner (responsible for all of Steve Martin's best films) he directs it a perfect pace and tone. It's not high art and he knows it, so he just has a ball with his cast. It reminds me in many ways of the first Police Academy - silly, good-natured and extremely funny.Mark Harmon is totally charming and is so at ease in this film it's impossible not to be taken along by him with a grin on your face. All the students do a great job - Dean Cameron as Chainsaw is hilarious and who would have thought the sexy little blond playing Pam would grow up to be so scarily square-jawed as Georgia in TV's 'Ally McBeal'. What I really love are the small details that raise this film out of the usual 'drop-out high school' comedies. The horror fixation of Chainsaw and Dave is brilliant and produces one of the most memorable scenes in 80s comedy. Finally, and most importantly, Wondermutt is one of the all-time great screen dogs.

The young actors who play the students are all great in their roles as well, particularly Dean Cameron and Gary Riley as the horror movie-obsessed Metalheads who steal every scene they're in. Fabiana Udenio is beautiful as the obligatory foreign exchange student that comedies in this genre seem to always have, but Courtney Thorne-Smith absolutely steals her thunder as the drop-dead gorgeous blonde surfer-girl (with a brain in her head). And what really makes this movie great is that it tells a story, ends happily, drops a few good morals along the way and doesn't ever resort to toilet/sexual humor to get good laughs, unlike WAAAAY too many cheap ""comedies"" of the 21st century. As a 35 year-old who was only 2 when the movie was released, not to sound like a relic, I'm still gonna say that they just don't make good comedies like this anymore. Too bad. 4/5 stars",Summer School
53,honoringgod02134,great film,9,15 February 2009,"This is really an example of how a romantic comedy should be and how fantastic a romantic comedy can be. Intelligent, witty and great fun. It gives its audience respect by delivering a clever story with good actors and great lines.The story is quite absurd and so is the duo in it - Mark Harmon and the gals. But this is just a good thing. Hollywood usually thinks its audience is filled with morons when making romantic comedies, but this is not so. There are still a few of us out here who enjoy the combination of intelligence, elegance and romance. This film delivers on all counts.Love is a simple enough ingredient for a film. This film knows how to use it and the result is wonderful.",Summer School
54,welshkay-1,A Great Comedy,10,8 September 2009,"This is just a great comedy/summer movie. It's light -- though with some serious moments -- and just a lot of fun. Mark Harmon as Freddie Shoop is so believable, and likable, as the lost-at-sea-but-with-a-good-heart teacher forced to teach summer school. His class of misfits is great, believable and likable too; a cluster of perhaps damaged souls and ""outsiders"" going through a tough time in anyone's life – high school. Shoop is a bit of a slacker, in his own right, and manages to get himself into some awful situations, that in real life could go horribly wrong. But in the film world he's allowed to work them out and turn them -- and his young charges -- right. The situations are hilarious -- some, painfully so. And Robin Thomas as the sneaky-bastard vice principal Mr. Gills is truly unlikeable, in a very fun way. Kirstie Alley's Ms. Bishop is sedate and sensible -- the perfect foil for Shoop. And, of course, there's Wondermutt. What a great dog – and the perfect ""mascot"" for this film. Everything about this movie works, and I highly recommend it. It will make you laugh and feel better about life.",Summer School
55,ILoveCheapHorrorFlix,Fresh even today,8,5 June 2007,"Jethro Gibbs he is not in this movie. Mark Harmon is an all around fun grown up who hasn't grown up. Even though this movie was filmed in the 80s, the only real way to tell was Pam's uncles awful mullet, a bit of clothing, and the free sunglasses. This movie could've been filmed yesterday and you probably wouldn't even notice. Courtney Thorne-Smith is painfully sexy, Kirsty Allie coming in second. The acting is surprisingly good, and there are minimal obvious errors and goofs. This movie is fun, easy to watch, and a real ""brighten up your day"" kinda film. Mark Harmon, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kirsty Allie, and Wonder Mut...all on the beach. What more could you want? Thumbs up twice for this gem!",Summer School
56,crlong,The Perfect 80s Summer Movie,10,19 January 2002,"This movie is, in my opinion, one of the most entertaining movies to come out of the 80s.  It is also the type of movie that you are most likely to see at 2 am on the Superstation.  This is not a Oscar-winning or very thought-provoking movie, but it is still a great movie to watch if you want to remember what was great about the 1980s.",Summer School
57,petessheep-22-519839,Little House on the Prairie reunion + Brainless fun and laughs,10,6 January 2021,"If you are looking for something deep skip this movie but if you want some brainless laughs with loads of eighties nostalgia this is the movie for you. One specific thing that happened in the movie that I actually used in real life was 1 shoot past the kids practice their writing skills by writing to companies to complain about things that made them unhappy to show them that their writing can get a response and a started doing that in real life and getting responses which was fun.Plus on top of it all I didn't realize till a few months ago that the Texas chainsaw horror scene was a reunion of sorts. The actress who plays the substitute teacher is the one who played the teacher on Little House in season 6 and the kid who played Kevin Winchester played Andy Garvey. If you happen to be in your mid to late forties and want some nostalgia from when we were young, get to watching.",Summer School
58,ebanfi-fusiorari,It makes me think when I was a kid,10,18 November 2007,"Oh gosh! I really enjoyed this movie from the first time I ever saw it. I remember it was the summer of 2000, I was 14 and it was the beginning of the summer, and I saw this movie from a local Italian TV (here this movie is called ""Lezioni D'Estate"", which it means ""Lessons In The Summertime"" and its never been in cinemas, only TV). I can recall I used to pass the entire month of June (before to go on holiday) watching this movie again and again...The VHS was always stuck in that old thrashed-up VCR...and after Summer School there was recorded ""Teen Wolf""....what a perfect couple! I was dreaming about the girls and the beach and the fun....It was really so innocent at the time...even if u think about getting' high or getting' drunk or getting' laid...And I think that what makes so good Summer School is its naif spirit...there aren' to bad words and is really clean...it's not Spring Break or Revenge Of The Nerds...it's a summer teen movie bit it's not so stupid...I still really enjoyed now that I'm older. It really makes me laugh so hard...the script is brilliant, like the ""I don't know anything!!!"" scene. P.S. One thing more: the summer of '00 for me was great: plenty of booze and girls for the first time and my friends used to call me ""Chainsaw""...Thanx to this little movie.",Summer School
59,angnizzle,best movie ever!,10,14 December 2007,"I love, love, love the film Summer School. It is one of my favorite movies, and I love 80s movies. My favorite characters in this film is chainsaw and Dave. They love horror movies just like me, and have Freddie Kruger on their locker, and I love Freddie. Also i met Shawnee Smith, she was at a horror convention. Whoever hasn't seen this movie has to see it. Trust me you'll love it just like i do. First of all great cast, great director. I love Dave because he is from Stand By Me, and he met Corey Feldman, and I just love him. Another thing R.I.P. to Gary Riley the guy who played Dave. He has just died from a major car accident. I loved him. Sorry I'm such a movie freak, cant help it, but don't feel like typing all of my favorite movies. Love everybody from Summer School, and great job.",Summer School
60,ashlie08,Great Performance By Mark,10,11 November 2005,"Summer School is a great movie. I am a very big fan of Mark Harmon and this is one of his best films. In most of his movies he plays a strict but sometimes funny man but in this movie he acts very stupid and makes this such a good movie. Hope you will rent or by this movie if you haven't seen it yet. ***Must Watch Movie***If you like this movie you may like some of Mark Harmon's other movie like The Presidio, Local Boys, and Casulties. Also if you liked this movie you may like NCIS on CBS which Mark plays the boss and can be very strict at times but very very funny at others. This is my comment on Summer School hope you enjoy/enjoyed the movie.",Summer School
61,rileycal,"Enjoyable, with many early appearances by now familiar faces.",8,13 January 2007,"For beautiful female faces and bodies, you cannot beat this movie... Never have Courtney Thorne-Smith, or Kirstie Alley (Cheers) been more physically scrumptious. No skinny model-bodies there! Shawnee Smith (Becker)was gorgeous, if pregnant. The male counterparts were equally California attractive. The Venice boardwalk/beach location shots are nice. What school building location is that? I found the two delinquents (Chainsaw and pal) to be NOT funny, but annoyingly, arrogantly, repulsively criminal (because I am over 18) and they should NOT have been indulged by Harmon's character, but rather, sent to juvenile detention facilities so the other schoolmates could perhaps advance a bit faster. Just my opinion.",Summer School
