0,MartinHafer,Sam Rockwell had a well written and interesting character...Anna Kendrick was not so lucky.,3,18 January 2018,"He's honest about killing--she thinks he's kidding
at times, writing seemed dumb--such as with her laughing
some dialog is surreal and funny--hers isn't
her powers are dumbMartha (Anna Kendrick) has just broken up with her boyfriend after catching him cheating on her. Now she's on the rebound and stumbles upon a really neat guy--he's sweet, he's thoughtful and he is adorable. Unfortunately, Francis (Sam Rockwell) is an assassin who's taken to killing his clients. After all, they want someone murdered so he feels no problem in just killing them instead. But what will Martha do when she discovers that Mr. Right is not quite as perfect as she'd hoped?Sam Rockwell's character is cleverly written and the dialog is nice. Unfortunately, Kendrick's character is pretty stupid, unconvincing and stupid. Yes, I said stupid twice...and her badly written character was simply annoying and awful.",Mr. Right
1,SnoopyStyle,cutesy assassin movie,6,31 December 2016,"Martha McKay (Anna Kendrick) keeps picking the wrong guys. Her boyfriend cheats sending her into a binge in the drunk closet. A night out with the girls doesn't help. She bumps into Francis (Sam Rockwell) and he immediately asks her out. He tells her that he's an assassin and that he's being hunted by other assassins. She doesn't believe him but it's all true. His former boss (Tim Roth) has been assigned to kill him.Max Landis writes another cutesy ordinary-people-turned-assassin movie. Like American Ultra, this has some fun appealing elements and some other messy convoluted elements. This one is slightly better mainly due to the super-cute Anna Kendrick. Her character is fun because of her. The most interesting character other than the leads is Steve. Almost everybody else is problematic and needs a rewrite. The story is messy. At one point, Martha says that she doesn't understand their plan. I have to agree. There has to be a better way to write that to make sense. It shouldn't be that complicated.",Mr. Right
2,Prismark10,Gross Pointe Right,5,2 July 2017,"Mr.Right is a quirky, breezy romantic comedy with action scenes. After a painful breakup Anna Kendrick finds her perfect guy, Sam Rockwell who dances his way through her heart. The trouble is he is a hit-man who wants to go straight but his handlers do not want to let him go and he is pursued by Tim Roth.The film is not that original with shades of Gross Pointe Blank but it is not as good as that film.",Mr. Right
3,kosmasp,Movie (got it) Right,9,22 November 2016,"Man, the chemistry between Anna and Sam is amazing! But everyone in this has a blast. I mean I kind of almost gave up on RZA and the acting thing he seemed to be trying out, but it turns out, with a decent script (preferably not written by him), he gets things done too. But as mentioned from the start, it's the 2 leads who shine throughout and make this more than worth your while.It's off though and that probably will put people off. Because the humor on display here will not be to everyone's liking. Not to mention the fact that it's also very violent. And has some romantic themes woven in between. Also it may seem to easy how our leads find each other. But does that really matter? The script is impeccable and the dialog will surprise you more often that not (hopefully if you're in the mood, in a good sense). I loved this way more than I probably should, but then again, the combination of Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick could not disappoint",Mr. Right
4,classicsoncall,"""Let's focus on one psycho at a time.""",5,20 January 2021,"If you can get past the first ten or fifteen minutes or so, you might be okay. It starts out so valley girlish you might think you have the wrong picture. Anna Kendrick's portrayal of her character went beyond quirky and to me was just plain annoying. I like Sam Rockwell, so he was a bit of a saving grace for the picture, but even he had to engage in some atrociously whacky dialog. As an accomplished international assassin, Francis (Rockwell) finds that he has some remorse for his past, so with that as a premise, the story takes an Orwellian turn. Francis is so disturbed about killing people for hire, that he takes it out on anyone who wants him to fulfill a contract, and kills them instead! What an adorable trait for a would be boyfriend. So that's the deal, and valley girl Martha (Kendrick) falls right in line after some initial reservations about her poor choice in men. Even the bad guys in the film are pretty pathetic, and I know this was supposed to be somewhat absurd to begin with, but the follow through just screamed out 'dumb'. The icing on the cake was Martha joining in the fun by killing a couple gangsters to seal the relationship at the finale. They probably deserved each other.",Mr. Right
5,blanche-2,pretty funny black comedy,6,30 August 2017,"I guess this was an independent film, since boxofficemojo.com says it grossed $34,000. Is that correct?Martha (Anna Kendrick) is waiting for her boyfriend when he enters the house, passionately kissing another woman and throwing her on a table. Devastated by her breakup, Martha laments meeting Mr. Right. But she does meet him - an attractive guy (Sam Rockwell) with a great sense of humor who seems really into her. Both are smitten.This new guy (we find out later his name is Francis) tells her he's a hit-man, he just killed someone, etc., all of which she finds terribly funny. Until she actually sees him shoot someone. He can't understand why she's upset. He really doesn't want to kill any longer, so what he's been doing is killing the people that hire him, not the actual victims. Martha's a little upset. Also, it seems that a cartel Francis worked for, led by a man named Hopper (Tim Roth), is after him. So he's not actually Reynolds, the FBI guy she thinks he is.Funny comedy that is also surprisingly violent and has some great choreographed fight scenes. Tim Roth as the FBI guy has a southern accent but reverts to his usual British as Hopper. I've been watching him on ""Lie to Me,"" and he's playing a similar out-there character.I loved Katie Nehra as Martha's friend Sophie, and the bad guys are funny too - James Ransone, Anson Mount, Michael Eklund, and RZA as a not-so-bad guy.Entertaining.",Mr. Right
6,Calicodreamin,Tries too hard,3,27 March 2020,"This movie tried way too hard to be cool and funny and edgy, which results in a one note boring mess. The acting is good, but literally all of the jokes fall flat, I don't think I laughed out loud once. There's really no chemistry between the main characters. It's just all very bland. Well choreographed fight scenes though.",Mr. Right
7,deloudelouvain,Absolute garbage with no humor and a terrible story-line.,1,30 August 2016,"Once again I got completely fooled by the high ratings a movie gets on IMDb. I wonder what's wrong with people, giving such an awful movie such a high rating. When I read the reviews and I saw the cast (that has a couple good actors, let's be honest) I thought I was going to have a nice evening with a lot of laughs. Nothing of this at all. The only time I laughed was just before I wrote this review and saw that Mr.Right was categorized in the humor section. Really? That's humor? Well I guess I have a different sense of humor then because I thought this movie could not be any more stupid then it is. The humor is so childish you must be a bit retarded to like it. But anyways, I get some people laugh with other things then other people. That's fine. But then there is still the story, and that is probably one of the worst stories I ever saw in my life. What were those good actors thinking when they read the script? Why did they sign up for this? I don't get it. It's an awful horrible movie, a waste of your time. I saw thousands of movies, really bad ones, low budgets where you already know after five minutes it's going to be a disaster, but this one has a budget with decent actors, and still it is definitely one of the worst movies I saw. At one point my wife and I couldn't take it anymore, paused it, and saw there was still half an hour of torture to go through. I resumed the movie with the hope there would be a 15 minutes credits at the end so I would only have to suffer for 15 more minutes. Avoid this garbage at all cost!",Mr. Right
8,namashi_1,"Absurd, But Great Fun!",7,12 April 2016,"'Mr. Right' is an absurd Action-Comedy, but its undeniably Great Fun too! Its fast, witty & violent, but it makes for a good watch, thanks to its mostly Crisp Writing & Strong Performances.'Mr. Right' Synopsis: A girl falls for the ""perfect"" guy, who happens to have a very fatal flaw: he's a hit-man on the run from the crime cartels who employ him. 'Mr. Right' induces romance, comedy & some pulsing action in those 92-minutes. Max Landis's Screenplay is crisp & moves on a fast-pace, wasting no time in any unwanted subplots or prolonged sequences. Its perpetually absurd & its fun to see its violent protagonists take on love & the bad-guy in the goings-on. Paco Cabezas's Direction is good. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Action-Sequences are sharply executed. Performance-Wise: Sam Rockwell & Anna Kendrick are in Tremendous form. Rockwell doesn't miss a beat as the hit-man with a soft heart, while Kendrick is a hoot as the heartbroken & yet love-driven young blood. Kendrick steals the show, reassuring her remarkable talent. Tim Roth is effective, as always. RZA is alright. Others lend able supportOn the whole, 'Mr. Right' gets it Right. Recommended!",Mr. Right
9,Hellmant,"Feels like a romcom, but there's definitely a lot of violence as well.",8,8 June 2016,"'MR. RIGHT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Action-comedy flick about a hit-man, on the run from his former employers, who falls for a recently dumped young woman. The movie stars Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick, as the two leads; and it costars Tim Roth, James Ransone, Anson Mount, Michael Eklund, Katie Nehra and RZA. It was directed by Paco Cabezas, and written by Max Landis (who also wrote, or co-wrote, 'CHRONICLE' and 'AMERICAN ULTRA'). The movie didn't receive very good reviews from critics, but it was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards; including Best Comedy and Best Actress in a Comedy (Kendrick). I really enjoyed it. Martha (Kendrick) catches her boyfriend cheating on her with another woman. He accuses Martha of being uninteresting, and she has an alcoholic breakdown. Martha then runs into a friendly (but creepy) stranger, named Francis (Rockwell), at a convenience store. The two immediately take a liking to each other; but things turn strange, when Martha finds out Francis is a former hit-man. Francis now kills the people who try to employ him, instead; and a lot of people are now trying to kill him, as well.The movie is quirky, sweet and action-packed. It sometimes feels like a romcom, but there's definitely a lot of violence as well. It also feels (kind of) Tarantinoesque, and Rockwell and Kendrick are both fantastic in the leads. I had a lot of fun watching it too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8E1WKbyL3YM",Mr. Right
10,FeastMode,my notes,6,24 July 2019,"I have to start by saying this movie overall is pretty stupid, can't really be taken seriously, and has a LOT of dumb stuff. like ridiculously stupid things happen. all that said, i enjoyed this movie. it was pretty funny, sam rockwell is amazing, and some of the action was pretty decent. I was surprised and how much i laughed at anna kendrick's character. when it started i thought she would do the typical girly humor. but she was really funny (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
so apparently he has some kind of super powers or can use the force or something, and can easily teach her to use it to. lmao when they first showed that i couldn't believe it. before that i was wondering why they didn't give this a wide release because it started pretty well, and then he teaches her the super powers and i realized that's probably why.",Mr. Right
11,ThomasDrufke,Who Wants to be Normal?,6,29 August 2016,"There's nothing outright special about Mr. Right. But a charming turn (as always) from Sam Rockwell and some well-developed chemistry between him and Anna Kendrick make it a solid cable watch.Mr. Right tells the story of an unhinged and borderline psychopathic former hit-man, who romances a recently dumped woman named Martha. The two romantically connect based on pretty much nothing at all, but it works. Kendrick and Rockwell's bond gets increasingly better as scenes go on, as does the quality of the film. It's really difficult to blend the genres of crime and comedy well, especially with an R rating and while it wasn't all great, this film had a lot going for it.This film deals with a certain amount of supernatural concerning Rockwell's impressive ability to literally dodge bullets. Yes, he literally dodges bullets. It took a while for me to become accepting of such a notion, even in a comedy. I get the tone they were going for, but I was legitimately turned off by the main character's unbelievable abilities. It didn't help that Martha seemed to gain these abilities by Rockwell's character simply moving her hands a certain way for a few minutes. That happened.With that said, once I adapted to the ridiculousness of the story, I had some fun with the action and the performances of both Kendrick and Rockwell. It's bloody and uncompromising, which is also something that is difficult to depict in a comedy, but Rockwell's happy-go-lucky attitude towards this violence put a satirical and goofy vibe to the gore, which I accepted.On the other side, I wasn't really a fan of Tim Roth's antagonistic role. I just didn't buy into his extreme hate towards Mr. Right at all. I don't want to say Roth was phoning the role in, because he's world class, but there just wasn't enough there for me to dig my teeth into his character.The screenplay was written by the always interesting Max Landis, who has a strange sense of humor, and all of that comes out in Rockwell's performance. That combination was perfect, which is why I can accept some of the other mishaps. But I would have liked a villain and a story that built more gravitas and weight to the third act. Especially considering Mr. Right is near invulnerable, so it's tough to ever really care about what's going on. But if you're looking for a fun and uninvolved action comedy, give this one a shot.+Rockwell kills it as always+Landis' strange and quirky script+Great music choices-Roth-Explanation of Mr. Right's gifts would have been helpful6.1/10",Mr. Right
12,cosmo_tiger,"Fun, funny, entertaining, exciting and enjoyable. Has everything you want in dark comedy. I loved it.",8,4 June 2016,"""You show up and you're like the greatest thing ever...and then you kill people."" Martha McKay (Kendrick) has just broken up with her boyfriend and doesn't know what to do with her life. When she meets Mr. Right (Rockwell) the two strike up a fast relationship and things are going great for Martha. Mr. Right though isn't what he seems. He is a hit-man who believes murder is wrong and lives by his personal code of ethics. When Martha finds out the truth she his torn between leaving him, or accepting who he is. This is just a great and fun movie. Perfect amount of comedy and action. I am a huge Sam Rockwell fan to begin with and will watch anything he is in. He is great in this role and Kendrick is perfect at playing the innocent type, but is believable when she steps away from that aspect as well. This is a movie that is nothing but fun and entertaining and is one that can be watched over and over and still be enjoyed. Won't win any awards, but this is one to watch and I highly recommend this for an enjoyable evening. Overall, fun, funny, entertaining, exciting and enjoyable. Has everything you want in dark comedy. I loved it. I give this an A-.",Mr. Right
13,Bored_Dragon,If you want to really laugh,9,24 April 2017,"My problem with most comedies is that they do not make me laugh. Most of them are stupid, unoriginal and shallow, simply bad movies. But even the good ones rarely cause the wanted effect. I'm watching and I'm aware that what I'm watching is funny, but I'm not laughing. This is one of the few that made me really laugh, often, loudly and even to tears on a few occasions.9/10",Mr. Right
14,tabuno,A Very Good Attempt But With Mixed Results,7,4 April 2020,"Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell star in this comedy action thriller where Rockwell, a hitman, falls for Kendrick's character. This strongly plotted and character driven movie unfortunately has the director allowing Anna and Sam to what appears to be ad-libbing many of their comedic lines especially in the first half of the movie. The raw live-comedy routine unfortunately only goes so far even with editing as the jokes seem at times great and smooth but at other times forced and lame. Nevertheless, the gritty nature of the movie mixed in with the humor and light-hearted elements that form the foundation of the movie almost gel and the extensive attempt to introduce a serious but righteous twist to the Rockwell's character is quite admirable and commendable. Such efforts lift this typical assassin comedy thriller above the ranks of the ordinary.But with the saturation of assassin, spy movies over the years has set a very high bar for any movie attempting to find itself in this competitive genre. Other more consistently smooth mainstream as well as independent movies which succeed even further than Mr. Right include: True Lies (1994), Pulp Fiction (1994), The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), The Whole Nine Yards (2000), Red (2010), Wild Target (2010), Daisy & Violet (2011), This Means War (2012), Miss Meadows (2014), American Ultra (2015), and Killing Eve (television series, 2018). With a little more direction and editing along with a tad more refined script, Mr. Right could have obtained its place among these entertaining in most cases superlative list of cynical, humorous, action thrillers of killers, hitmen, assassins, and spies.",Mr. Right
15,Platypuschow,Can't find it's identity,4,5 May 2016,"Now let's clear something up, I'm a big Sam Rockwell fan. This guy is extremely talented, naturally charismatic and is known for some fantastic films including the likes of Moon & The Way Way Back (Which he stole) but lately he's been dropping the ball badly. From Poltergeist to this the man is still great but cannot turn these trainwrecks into anything but that.This action/comedy/romance isn't even remotely funny and I struggled to like any of the characters (Especially Kendrick) Don't get me wrong this isn't the worst film around, it has a couple of redeeming features (Rockwell being the main one) but ultimately it's badly flawed and didn't live up to my expectations at all.",Mr. Right
16,UniqueParticle,Love this movie so much! Review 980 too,10,16 June 2020,"So wildly entertaining, I love the style and way it was written; I need to own it! Mr. Right might not be for everyone but I absolutely love everything about the movie. Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are so great together, I cant believe the movie isn't talked about more. The director needs to more awesome fun time projects.",Mr. Right
17,Reno-Rangan,A hit-man with the 'killing is wrong' attitude.,5,4 July 2016,"Something is not right for 'Mr, Right'. It is not an event based action- comedy or something like man meets woman romance-comedy, but very random presentation. Where it begins and where it ends, you can't clearly say it is a well written script. The actings were decent, but the scenes aren't overwhelmingly impressive as it should be. Directed by 'Neon Flesh' famed filmmaker, after that film his other projects weren't up to the standards including this one.It is written by the one who was behind the 'American Ultra'. There's a strikingly similar between these two and you won't deny if you had seen them. Especially Anna Kendrick's character to what the Jesse Eisenberg was in that film. If we go deep, Sam Rockwell as well might fall into the same category to what Kristen Stewart was. At some point, one of the film characters mentions the same secret project. So I think it is the same universe and a spin-off.Sam-Kendrick combo was the highlight of the film. I hope they would do some serious subject together in the near future. The action sequences were good, other than that it's not funny at all or romantic. That means I did not enjoy it because the theme did not work for me which I felt very common these days. So it failed because of the lack of innovation and proper development, but the overall film was not bad if entertainment is the main agenda. I know there are audience for it and they will back it. I won't stand between you and your watch if you want to try it, I just say be careful, that's all.5/10",Mr. Right

Kendrick plays Martha, a young yet quirky woman who is trying to get over a failed relationship. Soon, she finds romance with happy-go-lucky guy, Francis (Rockwell) whom she discovers is a hitman killing only those who employ him. Roth plays Hopper, Francis' former partner.

20,freemantle_uk,A pale intimidation of Shane Black's style,3,20 May 2020,"Mr. Right was a film with a promising premise and talented cast but did not live to its potential. It was written by Max Landis, one of the biggest hacks in Hollywood as used to Mr. Right as a way to make a Shane Black style film, but lacked the wit and intelligence of his films. Mr. Right neither funny or have a compelling plot.Plus Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick were an odd couple because he looks old enough to be her dad. The director had to use flashy camera and editing tricks to mask the fact that the action scenes weren't good. He couldn't hide the low budget.",Mr. Right
21,dar0417,Age gap?,3,12 February 2020,Sam Rockwell & Anna Kendrick are usually entertaining to watch as other people in a movie. When it came to them as the leads they could not carry this one. In fairness I should have know that going into this one.,Mr. Right
22,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Sam Rockwell & Anna Kendrick are perfect together,8,22 July 2016,"As I was watching Mr. Right, I started thinking to myself, this is stupid. It's absurd and silly. So why does it work so well? The premise isn't unique or original. Girl meets boy. Girl falls in love with boy. Boy turns out to be hit-man/secret agent. Boy drags girl on mad escapade against some dastardly villains, the bond between them getting stronger in the process. It's an ages old formula. It sorta kinda worked with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, and elsewhere failed miserably with Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher. So why then does it work so well with Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick? Well, exactly that: It's Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick. The two are so suited for each other it's adorable. The both of them are quirky, awkward, unconventionally attractive and very unpredictable in their work. Neither are what you'd call traditional romantic leads or action stars, and it's in that sense that the film finds its groove. I've heard other critics bash on Max Landis's script for being to busy or too stoked on itself, but in a studio system that tosses us garbage like the Kutcher/Heigl version, I'll take anything I can get that puts in an admirable effort, flaws and all. Anna plays a jilted girl who is on a speeding rebound train that has a chance run in with Mr. Right (Sam Rockwell). He's charming, super into her and the chemistry they have is obvious right off the bat. Soon they're being appallingly cute and pretty much dating... that's where the trouble begins. Rockwell is an infamous assassin on the run from several baddies including his former agency mentor (Tim Roth has even more fun with accents here than he did in The Hateful Eight) who has lost his marbles, and a trio of mafia brats played by a volatile Anson Mount, a hammy James Ransone and a wicked Michael Eklund as that nastiest of the bunch. The film tries hard to balance the two tones, and fpr the most part succeeds, blending them with the helpful notes of craziness from everyone. The violence is brutal, stylized and often darkly comical, the romance is sweet but never gushy with just a hint of mental instability from both parties (sounds weird, I know... it works). Rockwell adds shades of his off the rails work in Seven Psychopaths, albeit with less psychosis. Kendrick is endlessly cute, and endearingly klutzy. Throw in RZA as a hapless killer who can't decide what side of the fence he's on, and you've got a diverse little cast with enough collective and individual talent to make this a good time. It won't be for everyone; I can picture many people I know big annoyed, or simply finding themselves unable to buy into it. But for fans of Rockwell and Kendrick (even if you're not, there's no scoffing at both their skills) it's a charming blast of fun.",Mr. Right
23,questl-18592,Mr and Mrs Right,7,1 March 2020,"Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell should be in more movies together. They were wonderfully adorable, charismatic and hilarious.

24,Kamurai25,"""A Good Man is Hard to Kill""",8,25 July 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.This has a very special recipe of madness to it, I honestly don't know how to tell you how this movie FEELS. Sam Rockwell has a very particular style of acting to begin with, and telling him to turn it up to eleven turns out amazingly. Anna Kendrick, better know for ""I'm a teen girl"" acting than intense action roles keeps every pace with Rockwell in both action and madness.While we get whiplash from how likeable Kendrick's character is before Rockwell comes in, the fun of the movie quickly takes off in both action and writing. As ""Mr. Right"" carries chaos in his wake, it starts to develop multi-threading between the two characters, and while Rockwell is the main focus for majority of the movie, I think it is equal part leads between the two.There is some funny business in the 3rd act as they do some things that would normally be 1st act establishing events, but one becomes a mini-arc of the 3rd act, and the other just isn't explained at all, unless I misunderstood.The only other movie that is even close to this is ""Wanted"", and that's pretty superficial, the higher philosophical points aren't presented in the same manner at all, the movies ""feel"" completely differently, but they both focus on the morality of killing and high reflexes.Definitely give this one a go if you like action movies, it's a lot of fun.",Mr. Right

This is the movie which steadfastily drills an idea into watchers' minds that being a hitman is fun and can be cute. I cannpt buy this. Nor can I agree with usually great Sam Rockwell, as well as super sute Anna Kendrick or Tim Roth's parts. I felt more like a deep shame or a terrible uneasiness than fun or giddiness. 
I am sorry, I cannot buy this concept, nor am I more thrilled with endless F-bombs or endless gore, blood and violence. Hey, I could have, had the message of the movie been different. Here, it goes on praising a murderous, bloody and merciless lifestyle. I can't get that. I feel like three great talents are wasted here and the whole movie is a huge unnecessary joke.",Mr. Right

27,thekarmicnomad,Romantic Action Comedy,7,26 September 2019,"A woman breaks up with her scum bag boyfriend and goes on a bender.
Following this she catches the eye of a psychopathic hit man and they hit it off.This is a romantic comedy - action movie hybrid.
For this to work both the romance and the violence has to be reeled back in a bit diluting both genres.
This isn't a problem for Mr Right as it is also very funny.
There are jokes about relationships and murder and both me and my girlfriend enjoyed this immensely.There is a really great balancing act here between Anna Kendrick's sweetness vs Sam Rockwell's craziness and Tim Roth's cold, British, pragmatism.
All three do an amazing job and the characters work well.The story feels very familiar and there isn't anything particularly new here (this film is 5 years old at time of review) but it chugs along happily.I found the ending was a little too cheesy and made me cringe a little.This is good fun!
It is probably best not too hard about it just soak up the action, the romance and the one liners",Mr. Right
28,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A mess of a movie that tries to be funny but fails.,3,14 September 2021,"When Mr. Right (2015) came out, it looked like a fun little action rom-com film. I was interested in seeing it because I had found Sam Rockwell's performances in Iron Man 2 (2010) and Seven Psychopaths (2012) to be quite engaging. Plus, Anna Kendrick is cute in a ""doesn't really smile"" kind of way. For whatever reason, I never got around to seeing Mr. Right when it was released six years ago. After finally sitting down and watching it on Netflix, I'm kind of glad I saved the money.It was clear to me almost from the start that Rockwell was phoning it in on this movie. Sure, he was charismatic as an assassin who kills the people who hire him to kill other people. The fact that he doesn't lie about his lifestyle to Martha (Anna Kendrick) made him amusing if only for the fact that after the third or fourth time, it should have been obvious to Martha that he wasn't sarcastic. And while some of the action sequences looked neat overall, it was clear they pulled out all the stops to disguise the fact that none of the actors were doing any of it.Perhaps the biggest turn-off for this movie for me was Anna Kendrick's voice. It felt so high-pitched and whiny with an almost ""high school girl"" cadence to it that I honestly tuned out within the first 10 to 20 minutes. I'm not sure what this movie was trying to do, but I'm pretty sure they failed at it. Perhaps they were hoping to mimic True Lies (1994)? Who knows. In the end, there were too many things that made Mr. Right wrong that I'm glad I've only recently wasted my time with it.A mess of a movie that tries to be funny but fails, I give Mr. Right 1.5 stars out of 5.",Mr. Right
29,PsychoBeard666,Daft fun.,8,14 January 2020,"A similar tone to Knight and Day but with romance established much earlier.

30,witster18,"Just passes on the shoulders of tim roth, sam rockwell, and the fast pace.",6,21 April 2016,"Its not a great movie by any means, but Rockwell is his usual fantastic self and the perfect casting for the role. His sarcasm really is the highlight. Other highlights are some competent action and fight sequences, and some other smaller roles like RZA's. The plot isn't entirely original but it still seems pretty fresh. It's better than ""killers"" imo, but not quite at decent as ""the in-laws"". The script is a little formulaic and dull. The direction is shotty and the music not so good. Anna Kendrick is fine - given what she was given to work with.. Come on now people, you pretty much know what you're getting into here if you read a plot summary, watch a trailer, or even look at the poster, so let's not act like you were expecting some epic film here. All that said, this was a cute movie that had a pretty solid structure and pacing. Again, having the right actors in here in the right roles saved what could have been an epic disaster. It doesn't play it as safe as you might think. The violence really helps in this case. A mindless, adult action rom com that didn't disappoint or transcend the biz. Rockwell could save the ship from sinking in a Titanic sequel.56/100 Fairly funny. At least it was more entertaining than Pitch Perfect 2.",Mr. Right
31,Seth_Rogue_One,Hit-man baby one more time!,7,31 May 2016,"Although the movie doesn't blew me away and a lot of the jokes (primarily the ones that came out of Anna Kendrick's mouth, who's character seemingly never shut up) fell flat I must say that in the end I was fairly entertained.The last 30 minutes in particular were pretty kick ass.The first hour has it's hit and misses but overall hits, Sam Rockwell is pretty entertaining and there is some entertaining smaller roles Michael Eklund, James Ransone and RZA stand out the most (yeah I know Tim Roth is in it as well, and I like him but the accent he's using threw me a bit off-guard I think).Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick is never gonna be talked about as the greatest film couples of all times by anyone but they had a decent enough chemistry.One thing I'd like to complain about was the soundtrack, I wasn't really digging that, I don't mind current mainstream pop but the choices in this movie swam mostly upstream for me (the Meghan Trainor one was alright but other than that nah), but I'm sure some will enjoy it.(For the record Britney's Baby One More Time is not on the soundtrack, I needed a title for the review and that seemed fitting)All in all a decent hit-man rom com extravaganza packing plenty bullets and little logic, but logic isn't really needed in this case.6.5/10",Mr. Right

33,0w0,Has great humour and lots of action too,7,9 October 2019,"The movie stars a hitman that (sometimes) has super powers (Sam Rockwell) and his new massively impulsive girlfriend (Anna Kendrick). Not only can he (sometimes) sense things around him before they happen but also (sometimes) slow time at will, but he can impart his powers to other people too (like his new girlfriend, for instance).Apart from the scatterbrained plot, the movie actually has some good humour. I'm not somebody who laughs easily, but this movie had me laughing a couple of times. And this is probably off-topic, but Sam & Anna make a believable and very cute couple in the movie. The movie has a nice amount of action too, and it doesn't dwell too long on the backstory of the characters or other non-sense like that.Overall, it's a good comedy-action movie, well worth the watch. 7.5 out of 10.
PS. Pointing out that he has powers isn't a spoiler, since it's shown in the trailer of the movie that he has powers, so yeah, anything shown in the trailer, isn't a spoiler.",Mr. Right
34,CANpatbuck3664,"Funny and Off-Beat, Mr. Right is Different Enough to Stand Out and Features 2 Great Lead Performances",8,18 December 2016,"I really did not expect to like this movie. I rented it on a whim, having heard little to almost nothing about it. I also hadn't really enjoyed anything written by Max Landis before this. But the cast was comprised of actors/actresses I like (Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick, Tim Roth, James Ransone and Anson Mount) so I figured why not? I was surprised by this movie, I can't say its the next big thing for action movies but there was a different style to it. It was unexpected and I ended up liking it despite any prejudices I had going in.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Martha (Anna Kendrick) has the day off and she's trying to do something special for her boyfriend. She tries to cook and botches it completely. She tries to take some sexy selfies but can't do that either. While she's waiting, her boyfriend bursts in with another woman and they start making out on the table. When confronted, her boyfriend blames her and actually starts to propose having a threesome with the other woman. Martha leaves after throwing a wine bottle at his head.We then flash to a man in a purple suit dancing his way through the hotel. It's the titular Mr. Right (Sam Rockwell) and he's there to kill someone. At the same time there's a van parked outside the hotel filled with mercenaries. Their objective is to take out Mr. Right after he's taken care of his mark. Mr. Right knocks on the door, the woman who answers paid him to kill her husband. He's flipped his mark though and kills her instead. The mercenaries have entered the building but their leader Hopper (Tim Roth) has elected to stay behind because he's unimpressed with their skills and he says ""someone has to return the van when you idiots are killed."" Sure enough, Mr. Right mows them down and flees the building with Hopper still on his tail.If you stepped back and looked at the story of Mr. Right, the plot wouldn't necessarily be routine but it wouldn't be wholly original. What makes this movie different is the energy and style in which it's presented. They cover the required beats, the meet-cute, the separation and the reconciliation. But the characters are weirdly endearing and the plot doesn't telegraph where it's going. The movie is more character/actor/dialogue driven but the story has been changed to put an altered spin on it, enough to make it enjoyable.The characters in Mr. Right play with certain genre clichés. You have the hit-man looking for redemption and the girl getting out of a relationship and trying to shake things up. But they haven't been done in this way in any movie I've seen. I would summarize this movie being a quirkier take on Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Martha and Mr. Right have their own way of relating/bonding with each other and I liked how they seemed in simpatico in their relationship while the rest of the world looked at them like Huh? I liked how the movie not only handled the main characters but some of the side characters too. I liked how Steve (RZA) became a distinct character out of nowhere and how Hopper wasn't the typical angry partner/boss and was more of a shade of grey. It was small things that made Mr. Right a little better than the average genre flick.This movie wouldn't have been a victory without Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick. Sam always seems to do his best work in dark comedies and the combination of his character with his great comedic delivery made for a winning combination. Martha is a character that you can see Anna Kendrick playing but the dial is turned up to the max. Martha could have easily come off as a brat but Anna is a good enough actress to sell it and she has some solid back and forth with Rockwell. Tim Roth, James Ransone, Anson Mount, RZA and Michael Eklund all do excellent work in their supporting parts.If I had one complaint about Mr. Right, it would be the dialogue. The movie had me laughing throughout but the quirky dialogue was a little off-putting in certain scenes. It didn't harm the grade of the movie but instead of having the witty banter turned up to 11 I would have recommended they dial it back to a 8 or a 9. Otherwise this was a pretty good movie. I forgot to mention that the action scenes are well done, they have their own distinctive touch. Mr. Right might not be everyone's cup of tea (judging by the reviews) but if you're willing to try something different with this off-kilter blend of genres (action/romcom), you could have some fun with this.",Mr. Right

36,SquigglyCrunch,Mostly Fun but Otherwise Just Fine,6,7 November 2016,"Mr. Right follows a young woman after she goes through a breakup and falls for a hit-man. Anna Kendrick is great in this movie. I haven't loved her as an actor all that much, save for her performance in 'Up in the Air', but she really nailed it with this one. Of all the places to put more into a performances, why she chose Mr. Right is beyond me, but I'm happy she did anyway. There were a handful of jokes that were pretty funny, but it didn't really go beyond that. I wouldn't call it a hilarious or even funny movie really, but I enjoyed the jokes from time to time. The story as a whole was alright. It could have been better, the characters could have used more development, the story could have used some work. If it'd been longer I think I may have liked it more actually. It ended too quickly, and just a little more footage would've made it all the more interesting and developed. One thing that really rubbed me the wrong way was the ending. It was so forced and unnecessary, and while I'm usually pretty lenient about bad endings, as they often occur in movies like this, this one just left a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't stand it. It didn't make any sense, and even if it did it was still dumb. Overall Mr. Right is decent. Anna Kendrick is great, and some of the humor is good, but otherwise it could use some work. In the end it's a fun watch and I'd probably still recommend it.",Mr. Right

38,DareDevilKid,Mr. Right Review: A Lot Goes Right for Mr. Right,7,16 May 2016,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.4/5 starsBreezy, ballsy, crazy, and, most importantly, entertaining, ""Mr. Right"" is a screwball, hit-man, action rom-com if you will, where Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis from ""Some Like it Hot"" meet James Bond, Jason Bourne, Ethan Hunt, and even a bit of Bruce Lee. The plot is unabashedly insane and could have done with a lot more explanation; the characters are bat-sh*t crazy and could have had better arcs, but the film as a whole is quite funny and enjoyable, mostly due to its effervescent lead pair that make this candy-floss tale of blood and romance more charming than it has any right to be.After going through a painful break up, a woman meets a man who appears to be perfect for her. However, as their relationship develops, she learns that he is a former hit-man. Their new, but genuine relationship is tested when his dark past comes back to haunt him. As the bodies pile up, she needs to decide whether to flee or join in the mayhem.Sam Rockwell, who literally dances his way through the action sequences with kicks, knives, guns, and punches (who'd have thought that Rockwell could have ever pulled such stuff off), hasn't played a character this satisfying in years while Anna Kendrick, although always funny, has never been let loose like this. Rockwell and Kendrick are a match made in some bizarro version of Cuteville, and literally sell the film's quirkiness on their backs alone. In- between, RZA pops up for a fun cameo as a kindhearted gunman for hire.For those who can warm up to this insane amalgamation of cool, mystery-assassin homage and adorable, love-at-first-sight schmaltz, ""Mr. Right"" may just be the most enjoyable action-comedy since Melissa McCarthy's ""Spy"" last year.",Mr. Right

But the movie was not all that bad, but Ana was so unfit for her role. She does her usual awkward lines but it felt the movie would have been much better if an older, stronger actress was used for the humor and lines.Rockwell was excellent, but he was not enough to really save the movie imo.

43,dvc5159,"Right Stars, Wrong Director, Bizarre Script",4,18 May 2016,"For Pitch Perfect's fans who think the infinitely cute Anna Kendrick could do no wrong, well, there's a first time for everything. Here's a film that feels like a Monday morning at work: a film with the right stars who are fully game for the lunacy promised by its strange and risky ""look-at-me-I'm-so-smart"" script, but is betrayed by poor, tone-deaf direction.I will admit, I am not particularly fond of the romantic comedy genre, although there have been occasional stand- outs. This one is woeful because the script tries its darndest to make the bizarre material work, which involves clueless young lady Martha (Kendrick) falling head- over-heels with charming 'nice' guy (Sam Rockwell, Moon) who is actually a deranged assassin offing his contractors. Kendrick and Rockwell are very likable here, showing great chemistry between snapping some truly funny puns and dodging bullets.But oh, how the filmmakers have let them down. A half-witty, half-annoying and fully self-aware script by Max Landis (Chronicle and son of Blues Brothers' John Landis) would make for a decent watch if handled by a director who understood the transition of tones - Kick-Ass' and Kingsman's Matthew Vaughn comes into mind. Not so for misguided director Paco Cabezas (the poor Nicolas Cage thriller Rage), who shifts from breezy rom-com satire to brutally violent action thriller with jarring violence worthy of a Jason Statham vehicle. It is about as awkward and subtle as a brick to the face and it threw me off the film completely.2010's Wild Target did this similar material better.",Mr. Right
44,TheHoodOfSwords,Rom Com Action Done Mr. Rightly,7,25 December 2019,"This movie is slick, I mean it feels very suave. Every moment gracefully moves into the next one. The performances are one sided and basic, but they're done well and make it an enjoyable watch. This movie is just as much of a romance movie as it is a action movie. Some of the action is even pretty brutal and intense. It's a fun movie with good acting and charm to it. It's a shame this movie bombed as hard as it did, because the potential for a sequel is pretty high given the ending of the film.",Mr. Right
45,Rendanlovell,Just....wow.,4,13 April 2016,"At this point in his career I will see just about anything that Sam Rockwell stars in. He has proved that, not only can he steal the show but more times than not, he is the only person that can carry any given film. The same is true in 'Mr. Right'. Just imagine typical Rockwell then add the fact that he dances his way through fight scenes and you have Mr. Right. If you couldn't already guess by that bit of info and the quirky poster, this film is very strange. It's about this girl who just recently broke up with her boyfriend when she meets Rockwell. A highly trained gun for hire that is on the run from some very bad people. Then they fall in love and kill a bunch of people. To this movies credit, watching it was an experience unlike any other. It is fast paced and very goofy. This blend of action, comedy, and romance was something that I really liked. It was often far funnier than many devoted comedies that I have seen. Whether it was the bickering villains or the bromance between Fancis and steve 'Mr. Right' was an undeniable good time.Max Landis may get hate for his work more often than not but he consistently makes fun films. They are upbeat, fast, and extremely hyperactive. Yet, some of the hate he gets is warranted. With 'Mr. Right' the problem with his script is often the dialogue. Some of it is absolutely cringe worthy. Listening to Sam Rockwell call someone a poopy head in all seriousness made me utter a very audible groan. The film was full of seriously bad dialogue that watching Rockwell and Kendrick try to save it was just sad. In my opinion, Anna Kendrick is one of the better offbeat actors working. She can pull off anything. Or so I thought, until I saw this movie.Apparently the one thing that she can not pull of is an insane, unlikable, and childish girl having a wicked mid life crisis. She was incredibly bad in this movie. Now, was she working with much? Not really. But why on earth did she choose to portray her character as a bi-polar, high pitched voice, hyper ten year old? This is also a bit of the writings fault though. I have no idea why the choice was made to make her act like she was a nine year old. She says things like, I'm a T-Rex, Rawr. Every single time she appeared on screen I wanted to gauge my eyes out. Yes, she and her character are just that bad.But the absolute worst part of this movie is the directing. This is directed by Paco Cabezas, who has given us such masterpieces like; 'Rage' and 'Neon Flash'. Coming out of this movie I can honestly say, that this is the most lazily directed film I have seen for past year. Even in the most basic shots he fails. When characters are talking back and forth and the camera switches between the two, most of the time the person talking isn't actually talking. They just overlayed their voice and hoped you didn't notice. The action scenes are a mix of shaky cam and quick cutting which results in headaches from not being able to see anything that is happening. And, to make things worse, he can't even position actors in the same spot for different takes.There are many times where an actor moves across the room between two cuts. It's never acknowledged by the other characters so I can only assume that the director just didn't care enough to make things look the same. These mistakes aren't just things that reviewers like me can catch either. No, these mistakes are so apparent that a blind man, standing with his back turned could point them out.I have never seen such deplorable direction in movie with names like the ones this has. It's absolutely mind boggling that seemingly no one even cared enough to make sure things looked the same from shot to shot. The only person in the whole movie that I didn't hate with a fiery passion is Sam Rockwell. He and Max Landis need to wipe their hands of this film quick or it might just ruin their careers.",Mr. Right
46,kaptenvideo-89875,"If loving him is wrong, we don't want to be right!",7,14 December 2016,"You've probably seen quite a few romantic comedies, how about a romantic action comedy for a change, eh? A girl meets a boy who happens to be class-A hit-man. But killing is wrong so he only offs those who hire him, or attack him directly. So we get a lot of punching and gunplay in addition to romance.Starring Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell, supported by colorful smaller roles by Tim Roth and Wu-Tang Clan's RZA, it's a quick-paced and pretty fun caper. Sure, it may be more of a boys' movie than a romantic comedy and feel like a mediocre TV pilot at times, but it's still a pretty nice way to spend 95 minutes. Some jokes, some action, story doesn't overstay its welcome... what's not to like?If I did anything differently here, I'd have written a more interesting female lead character, or at least added some memorable lines to remember her by. As it stands, Anna Kendrick (Jessica from ""Twilight"" and Beca from ""Pitch Perfect"") becomes a weak link here. Of course, she's always likable but her usual brand of Just This Nice Girl feels like an unspired choice compared to the great Sam Rockwell who is pretty much the epitome of cool in his generation of US movie actors right now. Rockwell on the other hand rocks as usual. He has been spreading his own brand of catchy weirdness in many different movies and genres, and won't disappoint the fans now either. He's lively, charming and also a more versatile performer of the two leads, even with shallow comedy material such as this.""Mr. Right"" didn't find an audience in cinemas where it disappeared as fast as a world-class hit-man after a successful ""job"".But if you happen to catch this cool little flick on-demand or something, I would advise to check it out.

And Kendrick has stretched her legs in this one playing crazy and sexy and beautiful -- the crazy girl that got away for all of us. She and Rockwell have an undeniable chemistry on screen. I don't know if this was all scripted or if they made some of it up as they went along, but it was amazing to watch. Great comedy and some amazing action scenes.

A quirky storyline and the way it was handled kept me interested for about an hour. Even Anna's irresistible charm couldn't save it from the ridiculous tailspin it dissolves into. I realize it's just lighthearted fare but a shred of believable text still needs to be met. It reached the dumb part at just under an hour then only got worse. It's worth seeing just for the beginning sequences when the lead characters meet. After a while, killing just ceases to be funny.

49,digdog-785-717538,very enjoyable mess of a film,7,26 May 2016,"Mr Right is a horribly wrong film.For some reason, someone at some point decided that a romcom and an action film were two things that would go well together.Now, we've seen this sort of BS before, in Mr & Ms Smith, Knight & Day, and neither is really an action film OR a romcom. Now, i was going to say that in Mr Right these two things mix successfully, but the thing is, they don't.So Mr Right is a horrible mix of two things that should never, ever be mixed together. But .. both of these things are really, really good.The plot is of a near-superhuman hit-man who falls in love with a girl, and decides to change his life and become a nice guy (no more killing, OK?). The romcom bits are done heavy on the comedy, and both actors manage to be convincing and funny with little effort. The action parts are both intense and very, very well directed (major kudos to whoever filmed these, you should have been given the helm of the Bourne films), and also feature a great deal of really funny humour, although of a different cut than the romcom bits.The film sort of comes together in the end as more of a straight action- comedy film, and i'm grateful for that.So, i recommend Mr Right - although i'm not sure *who* i would recommend it to. You will have to accept that you're watching two films at the same time, but i promise you in the end you'll come out feeling like you've had more than your share of fun.My vote: 8/10, -1 for the bad idea of mixing these two styles: 7/10",Mr. Right
50,mistoppi,An unique spark and charm!,9,21 April 2016,"First of all, the soundtrack was good. Especially Norman Greenbaum's Spirit In The Sky suited the first gun fight scene excellently, and if by then you had no idea what kind of action movie Mr. Right is, that scene tells it to you straight.Anna Kendrick is amazing as Martha, a girl so quirky you don't know if she's just weird or if there's actually something even more weird going on his head. Also the way Martha shook off ""Mr. Right""'s comments on killing people made me wonder several times if she thinks he is joking, or if she just doesn't care too much, because he is so perfect for her. Sam Rockwell is an interesting choice for ""Mr. Right"". When Martha first meets him, he comes off pretty creepy, and while Rockwell is still very charming, he still seems dangerous. Even the viewer is suspicious of whether or not to trust him, mostly because we have already seen what he does, but he just seems so nice, but it's masking how creepy he is, but that is kind of destroying how sweet and charming he is, and so on. Right then and there it's a vicious cycle, but of course when we learn more, we trust more.The romantic side of the film is interesting. The romance between ""Mr. Right"" and Martha is cute, but you feel like it shouldn't be. He seems older and kind of creepy, Martha just broke up with someone and also doesn't realise how her new, uh, boyfriend is actually a killer. But their chemistry just is astonishing. Of course there are a lot of problems in their relationship if you start analysing it, but they just seem like the perfect, cute, quirky couple.The action side of the film is very excellent. The scenes are fun to follow, and ""Mr. Right""'s skills make them even more interesting.The character ""Mr: Right"" is probably meant to seem quite mysterious in the beginning, because nothing is said about him or the origin of his skills immediately. But for some reason that mystery doesn't seem that interesting than other plot-lines in the story. I was more interested to see the action scenes, Hopper's hunt for ""Mr. Right"", the development of the romance and I wanted to see Martha become a proper action girl. When the information about who ""Mr. Right"" actually is, it's just like ""Okay sure"". It doesn't seem like an important detail. If I'd have to compare Mr. Right with another movie, it would probably be Seven Psychopaths. The reasons for that are Sam Rockwell in both movies, the humour, and just something about the plot, probably how there are several different plans and goals we are following all of them.Mr. Right is a fun action movie. The plot seems original enough, and the film is interesting to follow. It has a certain spark and a charm. What more do you need?",Mr. Right

They manage to engage the audience in a way that ""Kill Me 3 Times"" didn't because, funny though it was, none of the characters was actually a nice person, with the exception of Alice Braga.
Of course it gets dangerous when they actually start to enjoy it. I'm not sure a vigilante sequel of them knocking off bad people around the world would be able to sustain the sympathy - it would have to be very well written. But with the two leads they might just be able to get away with it. It would be nice to see RZA return too if there is a sequel, as he did a great job with his role.

All of the acting is great. Anna Kendrick is likable as ever, Tim Roth is fantastic for what little he's given to do, even RZA is good in his small quirky role. The main problem with Mr. Right is the production value. It's bad across the board: the directing, the editing, the script, hell the credits are literally Times New Roman 12 pt font. It's so noticeably lazy that it takes you out of the movie.Thankfully the leads have chemistry to keep it afloat. When the charm of this movie hits, it hits hard. There were plenty of laughs and I was rooting for this couple to kick some ass and work out their problems, and that's a testament to how well Rockwell and Kendrick play off each other and their natural comedic chops. They're just fun to watch. And when the baddies start showing up the action sequences are pretty cool too. Absolutely ridiculous, but gleefully entertaining. The plot is the bane of this movie. Any time the two leads (or Tim Roth) aren't on screen and the story shifts to the conflict between the two brothers, the guys who hired RZA and other nameless hit men to kill Rockwell's character, the movie grinds to a halt. Neither of the bad guys are likable. They're spoiled douchebags. In any action movie you'd like to have at least a decent villain but that's not even the case here. Tim Roth plays more an antihero whose motives aren't made clear until late, and it's not much of a payoff but it's always great to see Roth on screen. He plays a secret agent who constantly shifts identities so we get to see him flex his accent muscles which is always a good thing.I can't recommend seeing this movie because the plot is so frustrating, but I did get some laughs and the performances are spot on. If only to watch Sam Rockwell have a blast in the role of a lifetime backed by a wonderful supporting cast, Mr. Right is worth checking out. Just don't go in expecting greatness because you'll likely be disappointed.",Mr. Right

58,thefan-2,Gory entertainment,8,25 June 2017,"This movie has no message, no deep meaning, no pretensions at all. It is simple entertainment, with a few wry plot twists to keep you guessing and a really wonderful cast of characters. To start with, Anna Kendrick's character Martha is just eccentric enough when she first appears that you can easily imagine her zaniness turning cheerfully violent in the end. And indeed it does. Martha is the sort of person who, bound and gagged, can't stifle her giggles at the absurdly macho kidnappers she's about to kill.Sam Rockwell, as a practically invincible hit man, somehow senses that Martha shares his superpower (for lack of a better word) and opens the door to it for her just enough to enable her to join him.

The movie did not even have one moment of decency. Lousy humor, awful lines, nothing. This Anna Kendrick was absolutely lame. I mean, she should be playing other roles, some B role or something, in a teen movie. No offense but I see nothing special really. She has nothing to show for. This was also really below Tim Roth as well. I really appreciate him as an actor and although he did his best, this movie was just plain and simple stupid. To cut to the chase, the story is so not worth it and out of reality. I mean this script must have been written in the long hours that some constipated fellow spent in the toilet trying to get something out. And he/she did. The script for this movie! All the elements of the movie borderline so close to funny-stupid- unrealistic that it's hard to watch even for a minute without thinking that this is too much. Pointless.

Sometimes you're flipping through the movie selections and you see something that sounds like it might be intriguing. You don't have any other alternatives so you roll the dice on it. That's how we end up with something like Mr. Right. It stars Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell. I enjoy them when they're acting. So why not take a chance on this flick? What's the harm?It's one of those extra quippy movies where the banter never stops. Sam Rockwell shows up and is instantly attracted to Anna Kendrick. Boom they're off to the races with one liners and back and forth for the entirety of the film. Sam Rockwell is a hitman with a conscience. Some people don't want him to leave the life. Hijinks ensue.You've probably seen this before. This is certainly a formula film. The jokes land with a solid thud. They try to be as quirky as they can be and that only goes so far. If you're not on that wave length, it can become grating to one's poor nerves. This movie grates on your nerves. It is nowhere near as clever or as funny as it thinks it is.But it does eventually settle into an action movie. This is fine but there does not appear to be any stakes. This makes the incredibly drawn out third act hard to get in line with. I'm not on the wavelength for the comedy and the movie doesn't care enough to provide stakes for the action. Where do we go from here?I could hit up the performances. Sam Rockwell is as charming as ever. It's not something he couldn't do in his sleep. Anna Kendrick is a ball of anxiety and nerves. Also something else she can do easily without even trying. So the movie is hoping we can get behind their relationship and the quirks and charisma that they bring to the table. I could somewhat. They still seem mismatched but I could get behind their relationship until something is realized and it comes out of nowhere. I'm not going to say more but it is never explained and it takes you completely out of the movie.I have to stay in the middle of the road for this picture. It has its moments but it's not a movie I can recommend. I give it a C.",Mr. Right

The script is so stupid, and so full of plot holes and unresolved subplots. You end up thinking that a reel or two of the film was lost...I normally am a big fan of both Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell, but both of these talented performers are hopelessly miscast in this dull little movie. It is also very hard to believe 48 year old Rockwell and 20 something Kendrick as a ""couple"". Rockwell tries to hard to pull off a ""quirky 20 something"".. but never manages to overcome his obvious chronological disadvantages.Anna Kendrick should fire her Agent and anyone else who convinced her to appear in this movie.

Sam Rockwell plays a hitman who is going through a bit of an existential crisis about his life, think Martin Blank but less cool and more annoying. Anna Kendrick plays Anna Kendrick but slightly more annoying and hyper. They fall for each other, even though he is obviously mental and wrong un and slowly she starts to change to become more emotionally disturbed than he is. I mean, she makes a freaking great psycho, absolutely scary as you like, I could see her in a future remake of Single White Female. Oh yeah and Tim Roth pops up to growl his way through his scenes and generally play as Tim Roth. So, we have Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick and Tim Roth playing versions of themselves but irritating versions. I am being harsh because I like all three as actors, but this film did not work as whole for me. It had its moments of comedy and a bit of action that ramped up the excitement levels, but I am not surprised that this one passed me by on the first go around.

The truth is that assassins do not have relationships because of this fact and because of this it is completely Science Fictional along with the Dragons... hehe spoiler about the dragons. Anna Kendrick does an impossible job of being this women with an amazing gift that she has not harness yet and Francis somehow sees it and falls in love with it , It is like finding the most rarest gem in the world and there is nothing like it and that is one hell of a love story. Tim Roth is ok, I would of wanted to see more of a fight scene from him because he did mention he was Francis mentor and trainer, so I imagine we would see more into that aspect of the confrontation instead the movie Director pushed more towards editing this movie in being a Love story. I believe the problem with this movie started because they had a difference of opinion with the guarantors of this movie that provided the money, The director wanted a comedy slash serious action but the people that funded him wanted a comedy slash love type movie and when that happen it really shows the movie could've gone either way. regardless Rockwell did an amazing job holding this movie together, I hope to see a sequel of this movie with the duel together of a more james bond type setting.

Well, three cast members anyway - the headliners.The direction is heavy handed and persistently annoying. In fact, annoying is the byword for this entire mess. Here's an example: Rockwell is supposed to have such fast reactions that he can move to block a shotgun blast from only a few feet away. Here's another: Rockwell is alone being attacked by 8 or so guys. They line up in two rows in front of him rather than doing a simple surround putting him in the kill sack.But when the script pathetically calls for tension by having him and Kendrick captured, he suddenly has the reaction time of a sloth.Kendrick's charm shines through the miserable script which portrays her as the type of person who, in real life, would be stomped time and again on general principles.The only character I liked was played by Katie Nehra who was Anna's roomie. I felt her sympathetic and beautiful. It seems after being exposed to this mess, she quit the films.Kendrick has the potential to be this gen's Carole Lombard, but she needs to be choosy about what vehicles she's in.

But other than that, the movie was pretty ridiculous and bizarre. Some of the lines and characters were so silly.

74,svtcobra331,"Kendrick and Roth were great, but....",7,24 February 2020,"Firstly, this movie is NOT an Action or RomCom. Expecting either genre will result in disappointment. This movie is a generally effective film of the genre Screwball Comedy.It becomes apparent that this is a screwball comedy when the items in the store are caught by the two, and their initial courtship, followed by the improbable pursuit of Roth's character. The screen banter between Kendrick and Roth is excellent and the tasteful lack of nude scenes added some romantic points.
Ms Kendrick excels at making That Face when the story departs from reality... say like when Matthew Patel and his Evil Demon Hipster Chicks started their singing in Scott Pilgrim.... I think it's called the ""Wednesday Thursday Friday"" face... or at least I think that's what the letters stand for. Anyway, Ms Kendrick does it better than anyone. And once she accepts the screwball reality, she and the audience are really on board.My complaints: The setup was dreary and, sorry, should have been rethought. Maybe they made the beginning so bad in order to lower audience expectations. The actors don't seem to be to blame... Kendrick couldn't make me believe that she was angry with her roommates, but I blame whoever thought up the scene in the first place. If John Wayne is your talent, don't put him in a scene written for Pauly Shore.
Also, during one of the combat scenes, someone took a ten inch combat knife into his rectum., and the film was paused so that the audience could laugh. Who, exactly, thinks that's funny?Other than these points of the director/producer not doing their jobs, the story and acting were clever and fun so long as the viewer buys into the screwball comedy aspect.",Mr. Right

For the longest time it was Nicholas Cage, then Vin Diesel, but as I've gotten older, it's switched to Sam. And it all started when I saw him dancing in Charlie's Angels.Anna Kendrick, did a wonderful job making Martha quirky, with a touch of crazy. And Sam did a great job of being adorable, and making no bones about being crazy. Francis sees Martha in the store and is immediately fascinated by her. Martha has had many bad relationships, so she resists Francis briefly, but they just click, so they get close fast. Her friend interrupts this, to remind her of her failures with men, so Martha tries to back off, but there is too much chemistry between them.While Martha and Francis are learning about each other, and having some miscommunication along the way, a plan hatched by a crime family starts going horribly wrong as well.

So many movies today are special effects and explosions -- all aimed at the teen audience eager for the same old, same old. Sam Rockwell is fantastically funny as a hit-man who kills the people who hire him, rather than the people he is hired to kill. When he falls in love with the lovelorn Anna Kendrick you don't see how it can possibly work but the charm and quirkiness of Rockwell's character inevitably wins her over. A series of assassination attempts on Rockwell's life are ruthlessly snuffed out in bloodiest fashion that is so way over the top as to keep the audience laughing. A terrific script by Max Landis (son of John Landis of Animal House fame) makes you want to seek out more films scripted by the same hand.

And that's what pretty much ruined it completely.It never strives to be a real comedy, it never strives to be a proper action movie, it never strives to be a super hero movie. It has bits of everything but together with a lousy script it feels more like a fairy tale than something serious. A very average girl becomes a top notch serial killer in a matter of days, along with getting some crazy abilities. Villains act like they are spoiled three year old kids whose logic makes you feel sad for whoever wrote them, a top notch serial killer becomes soft and entrusts the first superficial pretty girl he encounters.

86,AnonymousFilmLover26,"""The clown nose is tacky."" This movie is wacky and weird.",6,11 April 2020,"And yet: I still watched it all the way through. Seriously, ""Mr. Right"" is surprisingly good.
I say ""surprisingly"" because... I'm a fan of Anna Kendrick, but I've found some of her recent movies to be pretty 'out there'...and kinda unappealing to my personal taste.
So here it is: would I pay big bucks for this movie? No, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't. But it's still surprisingly watchable, if you happen to find it playing on TV. I don't normally go for silly or outrageous movies; 'quirky' is about as weird as I can go, with film. And man, this ones got it in spades.
Some of the dialogue is cringey, yes, and it ends up a weird ""action-rom-com"" situation (kind of like PP3, but no Acapella)...some of the direction also had me questioning Anna Kendrick's scene instructions. During the first couple action sequences, AK is literally just standing in the background with a subdued look. Really, in the scenes where your ""Mr. Right"" is facing off with some violent weirdos, your main girlfriend character is just hangin' out?I wasn't as head over heels as I usually am for Ms. Kendrick in this movie, but I think that's more to do with her (slightly cuckoo) character than AK herself. She's not quite believable here, but I'll give her a pass because I like her so very much. To her credit, she and Sam Rockwell do make for a very unlikely pair. Her character Martha, does have more to do, action-wise toward the end of the movie, but the use of character still seemed off, to me.Plus one for the wackness of a character named ""Johnny Moon"". I still don't know if that was his actual name, but it was entertaining.
Plus another for Anna Kendrick's (Martha's) little jabs and quips at ""Johnny Moon"" and his posse.

Finding out that her boyfriend would like to have a three way with the girl he tried to sneak into their place at the last minute, priceless, but no cigar. Mr. Right is the hit-man with a heart of copper. He kills bad guys who want to take out contract kills on others. He's good at his job. He meets Anna at a bar and they hit it off immediately. Mayhem ensues and the body count begins. Mixed in all of this is the relationship of the two which is believable. The bad guys are cardboard cutouts but pliable enough for a killer comedy.

90,BlueFairyBlog,Mr. Wrong,2,31 October 2016,"It's difficult to know where to start with this disjointed, haphazard mess of a motion picture. Anna Kendrick, who god bless her, has become the epitome of a great indie performer, is a freak show of a human being in this strange, sordid love story. Playing opposite her is the equally talented Sam Rockwell, who is undercutting his trademark majesty with a role as a burbling, manic depressive hit man; who works under a moral code to only kill those who have hired him to kill. Somewhat out of the blue he decides that he fancies Kendrick, and she him, and they wander around New Orleans becoming best buddies. What starts as a cute, if imperfect, set-up quickly devolves into madness.Eccentric leading ladies have peppered indie cinema to great effect in the past. Unfortunately writers haven't been trying to make their female characters multi-faceted, which sometimes means their only persona is that of a weirdo. Take Martha for instance. She starts off as a cute, impish oddball, and quickly devolves into an actual insane person. Perhaps this is an intentional move because she and Sam Rockwell fall for each other, and after she hears about his terrible secret it doesn't take very long for him to persuade her that they actually belong together. Seriously. A hit-man, who kills people based on a moral code, that is flimsy even under Dexter's guidance, is easily accepted by a random stranger, and even loved.Besides the fact that they fall in love (despite the fact that each is acting unlike any known human being) the action is completely unrealistic. We're led to believe that any human can catch a blade, even if it's only inches from their face, based on simple, quick training. We are also led to believe that dainty little Anna Kendrick can take down baddies with little effort as long as she is in the right state of anger. Making her body a deadly weapon, and her character an out and out force of nature, is part of the plot so she becomes more empathetic to Mr. Right (Rockwell), and force her to fall for his calculated charm.I understand that unusual love stories are sometimes the most interesting (""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Harold and Maude."") but when you start the film as a cutesy romantic comedy and then try to keep that tone throughout, without expressly saying Kendrick is crazy, it doesn't feel authentic, or even enjoyable. You can argue that director Paco Cabezas did actually make Kendrick look crazy, but her friend still stands by her, she and her paramour never venture into violence, like any good criminal couple, and the film ends on an uplifting, cutesy note. Honestly, the unevenness of this film cannot be fixed just by pretending that its leads get to act however they want without some kind of consequence.",Mr. Right

This might be fun for someone who takes enjoyment from sticking needles in their eyes. My recommendation is not to watch this flick if you have been overdosing on coffee, Red Bull or Mountain Dew.
This advice is made by a non medical spokesperson. I can't believe that Tim Roth agreed to do this after reading the script. See how long you can watch without removing it from your watch list.",Mr. Right

It was really fun. Sam Rockwell was perfect. Anna Kendrick was perfect. It was darkly humorous without being terribly sadistic. I always expect good things from a film starring Sam Rockwell because he has excellent taste.What killed the movie for me, however, was the chemistry between the two leads. Like I said, they were both perfect for their prospective roles. The part seemed written for Anna, dry and adorably quirky....you know, what she always plays. Unfortunately, Sam look like he could be Anna's dad and it really kills the vibe. Because of her characters' traits, she seems much younger than she's supposed to be. Their relationship comes across as creepy.Otherwise, good movie.",Mr. Right
94,bobbyhollywood,"Deserves the R rating - but - Crazy and in some respects, funny.",8,30 October 2016,"As stated in the past, I don't write reviews, just give my humble opinion.The beginning was a little slow, and had me guessing. Ms. Kendrick goes into a closet to get away from a shocking sight - too her - that she wants to get away from.Mr. Rockwell is doing his thing as a hit man, but one with a sense of humor.Plenty of shooting and blood, a little too much for me, but others may not notice, after all, it is about a ""Hit Man.""The movie turns into a fun type of crazy, and just keeps getting crazier.I noticed someone listed a ""goof"" of the rain coming down in a late scene, they also should have mentioned the rain falling in straight streams down, nah, I don't think that a spoiler, just like they said - a goof.By the end of the film, I had to admit that I enjoyed it, much to my surprise.If you see it, give it a chance. Good acting by one and all, a few fight scenes were good.",Mr. Right
95,Fujiko-san,Shallow and disappointing,4,18 January 2017,"Its a real pity to see such great actors try and pull this terrible piece of script writing together. The characters (and they are LEGION) have all of the depth of the piece of paper their trite lines are written on. Anna Kendricks character in particular is lacking completely in motivation or explanation, but she is not alone. I could practically feel the actors strain to bring some sense of reality to their roles. The story is slapped together and fairly directionless. Who are these people? We barely understand what anyone is doing anywhere. The concept is a good one and God knows, I love Sam Rockwell, which just made this film all the more disappointing.",Mr. Right
96,BlockLike,Did not expect to laugh this much!,8,10 October 2019,"I thought this was going to be a run of the mill romcom.I am glad to say it was much funnier than I thought, full of quirky whitty little moments and some excellent action/fight scenes.Sam Rockwell excelled as the eccentric zany killer.The only negative, Tim Roth's Alabama accent is truly woeful... Like beyond woeful.",Mr. Right
97,j_smith_7,We couldn't see it through to the end,3,10 April 2016,"Sam Rockwell is a fine actor. Tim Roth is a legend of postmodern cinema. Anna Kendrick, I feel, has yet to find a role to match her talents - though, based on this film, those talents mostly involve fake goofery and gee-whizziness. Together, these three are responsible for this mess of a film. Well, them and director Paco Cabezas.This is a film about nothing. The story - such as it is - comes straight out of the imagination of an 11-year-old and is peppered with the most awful dialogue. 'We're in a big pussy parade'. 'I gonna take him out'. 'I actually...er ...like...I mean...er...that's awesome'. 'I don't remember what my life was like 3 days ago'.External dialogues reveal meaningless inner thoughts. Clichéd gangsters sit behind large desks with classic art on the wall while whispering comically threatening things. Overly rehearsed, supposedly spontaneous chit chat, comes across as some kind of theory lesson at acting school. Unintentionally comic fight scenes look like a Passa Doble. And the 'romance' facet is just silly.And I think that's the word I would use for this film - 'silly'. I have no objection to suspending disbelief at the cinema - indeed, that's why we go there - but, I also do not wish to be considered mindless and so easily duped.Pity - 3 great actors wasted. I can only presume they need the money for some reason.",Mr. Right
98,heisenberg83,Needed a shower after this one,5,16 August 2018,"Very strange film. I'm a huge Sam Rockwell fan - and although I always enjoy his cool dancey schtik, I couldn't dig the overall feel / plot of this flick. The attitude towards violence & killing people made me feel uncomfortable. Especially the glee & respect a certain character gets when they make their first kill. Throwing knives and catching knives, not a great idea for kids to see, if a kid happened to catch this movie. And what was Rza from WuTang doing in this movie? His character was pretty lame & could've been played by any generic actor. Why did he take this particular role? For a much better & way funnier Sam Rockwell film, try Welcome to Collinwood or Matchstick amen. For a much better hitman goes dating movie, try Grosse Pointe Blank.",Mr. Right

The true sign of a good movie, you can watch it over and over and each time you enjoy it even more. Why so good? It's a movie that I love each part and how its transitions with great blend of boy meets girls, open honesty, a dance of positive energy and going with the flow no matter what. I rarely, if ever, give a 10 but each of the actors, pacing, layering of this movie was simply Genius. Thank you for this ""work of art""!",Mr. Right

I mean seriously what depth exactly did you expect from such film?.. Enough with the sofa ""experts"" saying whatever they read somewhere else and actually review this..This film is entertaining with a really unique way, (i wont deny that the humor is really not for everyone) They create all sort of weird situations that make you laugh with the fact that they even happening like that.It also includes some fighting scenes that are actually really good with nice choreography. The plot has no holes in it, and i mean none,everything is covered just fine.grab some popcorn relax and you will have fun while it lasts. i would recommend it.",Mr. Right
102,thecanadian-23317,"Pretty silly, but not to be taken seriously in any way",7,18 July 2021,"I know that title seems dumb, especially given the premise of the movie, but there's something you have to understand about this movie - these characters are not written like human beings. They do not act or behave in anything even remotely close to human behavior - it's all done for the script/gags of the movie. So if that's not a dealbreaker, then this movie is a pretty good time! I laughed quite a bit, there's some silly sequences and some surprisingly fun action scenes. But if you need your characters in a movie to behave even remotely close to actual human beings then you'll likely want to skip this one. I don't know that I'll ever feel the need to watch it again, but I'm glad I watched it the one time and I would recommend it.",Mr. Right

Anna Kendrick is mal-cast as a quirky tough-girl. She could not pull this roll off because she had no depth or actual connection to the character. It seemed like she was doing schtick the whole time.Her love interest appeared to be way too old for her.The ""comedy"" fell completely flat. They were trying to make tough guys have a funny, human side, like in Pulp Fiction, but it all just seemed disconnected and written.I almost bailed on the movie about 5 times, but I didn't want to have to go on another big hunt to find an afternoon movie to watch.Overall, it felt mechanical, concocted, and riddled with notes from the development executives.Other than the script being lame, the biggest problem was the poor casting of Anna Kendrick in that role.It did have some great fight choreography though.",Mr. Right

I thought the leads had good chemistry together. It just felt fun to me and lighthearted which is the tone I think the director was going for.
This is one of those movies that was made more out of a passion project or just for the heck of it and not meant to be a blockbuster. I can respect that. Not every movie needs to be done in order to make a lot of money or win awards!
Is this a movie for serious action or rom-com fans? Probably not. But if you're a fan of mash ups and don't mind the goofiness then you will probably enjoy this movie. :)",Mr. Right

Some of the action was kind of cheesy, but it is a rom com so what can you expect? I'm a fan of Sam Rockwell's so I was just happy to see a movie with him in it.  As far as the title goes, ""Mr. Right"", well he defineltly is Mr. Right for her. Anna Kendrick's character is completely bats*** crazy as it turns out in this movie.

I loved the whole quirky relationship between Anna & himself, I honestly don't think the director and cast members could have picked a better duo for this movie! They mashed so well together!

112,artrouble21,post Deadpool funny,10,8 April 2016,An actually hilarious comedy that never panders to its imagined audience as so many American comedies do and is just a straight up clever funny classic romantic Hollywood movie. With a cast that actually successfully redefines that hackneyed paradigm. Natural comic Anna Kendrick plays a seemingly mentally fragile leading lady. Sam Rockwell as our indestructible hero continues to deliver the most interesting performances on film these days. Tim Roth as the usual Brit baddie but with a mean streak and many hued shall we say accent. Tim just keeps on giving. Where are the Oscars?

Anna Kendrick is charming as Martha, a down-on-her-luck quirky girl (but not silly quirky ala Garden State, etc). Sam Rockwell (and I'll admit some bias here because he is my favorite) is edgy, sexy and his character is so very interesting. The best thing about this film is the chemistry between the two, which is bananas. The action gets a little out of hand, and it's pretty violent, but overall really fun and refreshing. RZA was a nice touch, and it was good to see Tim Roth, though he gave quite a nod to his character in Reservoir Dogs. Anson Mount was barely tolerable, as usual, but it worked. That's the thing about this film. It works on so many levels that the places that could be better really don't matter.

123,RachaelHP,Rockwell is exquisite. This is a batty and insane take on the rom-com.,8,14 September 2019,"Rockwell is a God. I would want no other actor for this role. Adorable, quirky, threatening, intense and goofy are difficult attributes to juggle and he effortlessly radiates them all in one single glance.Anna Kendrick, a comedic force in her own right, is a compatible player and they make for a credible couple. It's a tough ask to match Rockwell in his comfort zone and her attempts show a little at times, but casting wise, no other actress would make a better fit.The premise is insane, but perhaps somewhere in the world it's happening as we speak - an assassin who assassinates those who seek his services rather than the intended victims, falls in love and manages to harness the inner, untapped, quirky-violent nature of his new damsel while taking down an old foe and an enraged crime cartel... yikes...The antagonist in Tim Roth is perfectly cast and hauntingly real. The minor, cardboard villains who are quarreling dysfunctional mob brothers played by Anson Mount and James Ransone seem, unfortunately, set up to be hard to credit from the outset and this weakens the plot. Had they more bite like Roth, the darker elements of the script and Kendrick's character arc at the end may have resonated more effectively.All being said I love this film. It made my day. It's easily re-watchable and perfect for movie night. Rockwell is key.",Mr. Right

It is a really fun and funny movie. The sense of humor is very dark, but the characters are so cool. I just finished it, and the leads have great chemistry, and the story really moves along. Sam Rockwell's Mr. Right (don't call him Francis!) has fun being a hired killer who kills those who hire him, dancing while he is shooting and killing people, while wearing a clown nose. And Anna Kendrick plays a really quirky girl who really gets into her man's lifestyle, once she realizes he is not joking about being a hit man. And he never lies to her, so she has been hearing the truth from the beginning. Their relationship flows naturally, and the way he teaches her a new and deadly skill excites her as it would in real life. I mean, one way to make a woman feel close to you is to teach her a new skill, and it really does work like this. Anyway, I wish I was in a relationship like theirs, it would be so much fun killing bad guys...heh, heh, heh.November 12, 2017--I just watched it again. And it is still Hi-Larious!

Hell yeah, I'm in! However, the movie came as a big disappointment. While the basic premise sounded original, the plot is written and executed basically in a way to appeal to twelve-year-olds (nothing bad here, but it was marketed as a more serious rom-com and contains ""jokes"" that this age group probably won't get).Apart from the constant over-acting, the completely far-from-reality dialogue tries to deliver a joke with every line - which results in the opposite and turns the movie into an awkward disaster.For a love story, this movie is too violent and non-romantic (the main characters fell in love after 5 minutes of being rude to each other), for a comedy, too unfunny, for an action film, too lazy and unrealistic - even more than the latest James Bond installment. Example: OK, the main character has some sort of almost unnatural powers - but Anna Kendrick's ""normal"" character catches knifes he throws at her (for ""fun""), with her bare hands at the blade? That scene made me quit watching this mess; I doubt the movie got any better after the first half an hour.All in all, I can't get how Sam Rockwell and Tim Roth got involved here - what a waste of these great actors...",Mr. Right

It wasn't until he got an Oscar for his supporting role in three billboards outside ebbing Missouri, That he finally got the recognition he deserved for a long time. Anna Kendrick pairs well with him. Conceptually this movie is great and the execution is spot on. A rom-com doesn't have to be cinematic brilliance to be a great film.

Not only is she awkward on camera, but as an actress she doesn't display any qualities of a comedic actor. In actual fact she is quite boring and tiring on the eye.Sam Rockwell & Tim Roth are both good quality actors, who can have comedic charm, but unfortunately due to Miss Kendrick's character after 30 painful minutes we simply couldn't endure to watch anymore of this movie. Dare l say it, but this was even more painful to watch than the second of the Bad Neighbours movies, and that is saying a lot.When will there be a legitimate laugh out loud comedy released with real comedic actors who have on screen chemistry. We may not get another Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor, but please stop any more of these sub-par films attempting to be funny and failing in many peoples opinion.",Mr. Right
138,hkytoire,"Mr Right, Movie Wrong",4,10 April 2016,"I cannot figure out this movie. Let me start by saying that Sam Rockwell's character is a regular human being - not Deadpool or any other comic book hero. With that - He catches a shotgun round with his bare hand, hand gets bloody and then like nothing happened moments later. He tries to teach the impossible to Anna K. - catch large knives being hurled at you, she lnows she can't do it so he whips a French kitchen knife directly at her and she catches it followed by one after another. Then with no formal training, Martha (Anna) somehow becomes a 5 foot killing machine, a sharpshooting, martial arts bad ass. Mr. Right is a bit funny but nowhere near enough to make up for all of the nonsense. The movie makers could or should have made this either something close to reality or have gone the superhuman/comic book hero direction. I always wonder with these bad/stupid movies - isn't there a point in the filming process where somebody - actors, directors, etc. - turns to the other and says ""STOP, this sucks"".",Mr. Right
139,ozlemturker,I have really enjoyed this movie!,9,4 April 2018,I love Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick and to see that they have really great chemistry together in this absurd romantic comedy gave me joy! I think this is how romantic comedies should be! With its right amount of action and romance this movie was perfect!,Mr. Right
140,wfhbear,Mindless Funny Entertainment - I may have a veiled Spoiler or two in this.,8,13 April 2016,"There are those of us who don't want to think much when we are being entertained. Mr. Right is that kind of movie. There is a lot of fighting, dying, blood, gore, slapstick, and pretty girls. Anna Kendricks is fantastic as a girl with a very strange mind. She is loony. Yet when she figures thing out she is gutsy and brilliant at getting everyone off guard.I'm an old fashioned male. I grew up drinking, fighting and doing many really stupid things. I am also a Vietnam and PD Veteran. This is the type of Saturday evening movie want to see. I sat here with my GSD in our home theater laughing and even at times yelling a big YEAH!!! My wife would never get down in the gutter with me to watch and laugh like I did here.Mr. Right, Sam Rockwell is a fantastic actor who was able to get into this flick everything every old ""badassed"" guy thinks he can do or wants to do in a fight. Martha (anna) isn't like candy coated girls. She is more of the ""Jersey Girls"" I grew up with. Cute, Beautiful and easy on the eyes. Except ""Jersey Girls"" all carry a very sharp stiletto and oh how they can use it. Real poetry in motion.The entire cast go out of there way to be deadpan funny. Those who should be gotten are and those who shouldn't don't. The ending was a very huge roar of pleasure and hilarity for me. Either go to or rent this silly movie at home. Sit back, drink a couple beers, and laugh your butt off. Having a ""significant other"" who will laugh and giggle over this movie is a real plus.I don't think I've given away much of the plot or real spoilers. You need to be very surprised as this movie rolls on. It is part of the fun of this type of Comedy, Adventure, Action, and Romantic silly yet believable movie.BTW: there is no pornography in this movie. You may find a naked butt or two. If you need the gratuitous Porn rent a Penthouse tape to play after you quit laughing and facing punches from your theater seat or sofa.Have you gotten the idea that I loved Mr. Right and that I so love Anna ""The Cutie"". Enjoy!!! WFH.",Mr. Right
141,matrixmistro,Thoroughly enjoyable film and quite unique.ba bit of everything for everyone,9,10 April 2016,"Loved the film. Great fight scenes, great story. Great comedy and great acting I thought. Overall, I really enjoyable it and it has an unusual story line like nothing I have seen before. Closest is probably something like Mr and Mrs Smith but they're still miles apart. Both funny and about killers but that's it. I actually prepared this film in comparison. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think the overall rating should be above 8. More like 8.5. Sequel on its way? I definitely hope so. Thanks",Mr. Right
142,jamesmaybrick,Fun.,8,7 February 2020,"There are many wordy reviews of the film, clearly some people get it and some don't. All you need to know before clicking play of Netflix is...do you like Sam Rockwell being Sam Rockwell (dancing/being delightfully odd) and Anna Kendrick (doing her odd shtick). Do like want to see them involved in preposterous gun fights?And Tim Roth being Tim Roth?I like all the above and thus, love this stupid, idiotic, happy film.",Mr. Right

146,QueenMaddyBlake813,Honestly surprising.,7,6 December 2018,"I went into this expecting it to be a very mindless and laid back romcom. I was however; pleasantly surprised. Its quick paced, hillarious, well rounded and all around great. Highly recommended if you need a good laugh.",Mr. Right
147,spencermmarsh,Perfect date night movie!,9,9 March 2021,Watch it on a date bro!! This movie has a great love story enough to entertain the ladies. Has enough action to be amazing. On top of that it's funny.,Mr. Right
148,giuliamodesto,I wish I could unsee it.,3,1 April 2020,"Worst movie I've watched in a while. I usually like the movies Anna Kendrick is in, but this one was awful.Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick had no chemistry at all.
And this is supposed to be a romcom?! Sam Rockwell's character's personality is so weird it made me uncomfortable throughout the whole movie, and he's not even super attractive.
Anna Kendrick's character felt like an idiotic child - which made the age gap of the couple even creepier - who has as many mental problems as Sam Rockwell's character.I don't even know why I watched the whole thing.I would say that maybe with different actors this movie would have been better... but this concept was already used in the movie Knight and Day and indeed that was an entertaining action romcom that worked very well!",Mr. Right
149,ajrg54,"Strong characters, strong chemistry, a great movie",10,9 October 2021,I watched this movie a bunch of time and my opinion of it got higher and higher with time. The acting of the two leads and the chemistry is first rate. The dialog is very clever but most of all I liked that this is something I have never seen before. Two very quirky people are much better together and they are attracted by their bad taste in clothes. In my opinion it is perfect. I sent off for it.,Mr. Right
150,supersarz,Falls flat,5,7 September 2021,"Could have been a good movie but the actors weren't really given enough decent dialogue to work with. It feels like the movie could have been half as long as it is but they had to drag it out. Anyway Sam rockwell is good but i feel bad for Anna Kendrck, Katie Nehra and Tim Roth for having to scramble to work with what they were given. Also Max Landis needs to learn how to write for female characters.",Mr. Right
151,kressckerl,Great movie,10,9 June 2018,"I loved it, such a great movie.The humor is great and the fighting scenes are amazingly cool. Funny characters, I have always been a fan of the moments in silly action movies with a chase and they run into an elevator and they just stand there staring into the air and waiting for the elevator to stop, and back to chasing. There isn't such a scene but there are many alike, and it adds to the comedy part of the movie.",Mr. Right
152,jackburto,An Unrecognized Good Movie,8,8 December 2016,"This movie starts out funny and the fun goes on until the end. This movie likely took parts of different movies and spliced them together. I saw similarities of Grosse Pointe Blank, Knight and Day, and Killers. I am certain there are more that escapes me at the moment. Nonetheless, this is a fun and funny movie. I would suggest the intellectual to place their brain on pause in order to enjoy it. If you can't do that, then avoid the movie all together. It is not theatrical masterpiece. It is an escape from the everyday life. To address the actors in this movie; Kendrick was absolutely perfect in her role. Rockwell was flat at times, but it can be forgiven for his good parts. Just a good ole time.",Mr. Right
153,traviscornell,Terrible Movie. Worst Comedy I have watched all Year,3,20 October 2016,"I went into this movie pretty excited loving Sam Rockwell, and thinking Anna Kendricks is pretty funny and would have great chemistry together. Boy was I wrong. I found this movie painful to get through. It was painfully bad, terrible plot, you really felt like everyone involved wanted to get this movie over with and move onto the next project. lolI remember thinking it's not ZooLander2 (worst comedy of the year) and i'm glad I did not see this in Theatre as it was pretty terrible but not the worst comedy i'ver ever watched. I would stay away from this one, even with the star power of RockWell/Kendricks.",Mr. Right
154,dragonstar-22166,SOMETIMES THINGS JUST WORK,10,24 August 2018,"Sometimes you find a movie by accident and am so glad you did and Mr Right is just that movie.The plot is simple and fun. Not wanting to give away too much ""A Girl unlucky in love finally meets Mr Right who just happens to be a hit man"" This whole movie revolves around the chemistry between Sam Rockwell's 'Fancis' and Anna Kendrick's 'Martha' and they have it in spades it is a pleasure to watch them together on screen and they make such a great and beliveable couple that it carries the rest of the movie along in their wake. From the minute that they meet you want them to succeed and without that this movie wouldn't work.Both leads take characters that could all to easily be unlikable and annoying and make them people that you would like to meet and spend time with. Rockwell is a treat to watch in this role as he dances and kills all along making light hearted banter much to the confusion and chagrin of his opponents. He makes the character likeable and believable and Kendrick what a standout performance she makes you like and care about 'Martha' a character walking the tightrope between crazy and manic, and Cute and lovable like a master, in the wrong hands this character would be annoying and grating .The action scenes are well choreographed and and fun keeping it light and fast never going to far but just far enough with the blood and gore.Rounding out the main characters is Tim Roth who is a perfect counterpoint to Rockwell and Kendrick. He is the perfect bad for the film you don't want him to succeed but you also sort of like him.All I can say is sit back, put your feet up and enjoy yourself.",Mr. Right

I've watched this movie (3) times already. It is a light, whimsical, action packed movie that is utterly delightful to watch. The main characters are wonderful together. Plus, no women were exploited in the making of this movie.I found my foot tapping and a big smile on my face throughout the film. Wish more movies were like this one.If you are stuffy, serious, and don't like to have fun, this movie may not be for you.",Mr. Right

160,jpholroyd,"Terrible, just terrible",1,8 May 2016,"I honestly don't know what this movie is supposed to be. Tim Roth (Shame on you) gives a rubbish performance with a poor attempt at an American accent, a really weak character. The movie from start to finish has no positive points. The plot is poor, no depth to any character. The lead character, a hit man, drives around in a classic Corvette, hardly inconspicuous. In classic 80's style no one is able to just shoot him. He meets a girl, although there is no on screen chemistry, who just accepts, with some terrible slow motion knife throwing, that he is a 'nice' hit-man. The fact that this has anything more than a 1 makes me question the rating for any movie. Once again: Tim Roth shame on you.",Mr. Right

They try to be funny, they try to be ironic but it all feels already seen in bunch of other movies with much better execution. And the ""bad guys"" are straight out of 90's action movies with leather jackets. My god, everything is so stereotypical that it could only entertain younger audiences. Ones that never seen something like this before. I understand that you gotta do what you gotta do to keep afloat. Sam Rockwell is playing himself, again. If you have seen him in any movie, he plays the same guy here. Pure entertainment for your DVD player. But too dull for the big screen.",Mr. Right
164,mirihiboy,Great off-the-wall comedy,8,5 May 2017,"Not what you will expect, but a well written and funny comedy with the wonderful Mr Rockwell. This initially got quite a low IMDb rating, but I think a classic case of the wrong people expecting something they shouldn't. For fans of something a little different from the big budget comedy\crime genre, an entertaining and well presented film that delivers well above its humble rating, what more could you ask for?Do yourself a favor, watch it.",Mr. Right

It's not Citizen Kane - or even Star Trek: Into Darkness - but it beats the heck out of a lot of the garbage on the streaming services. It's fun, it's engaging, and doesn't overstay its welcome. A few items could have been developed further. The low-to-modest budget went far.I'm looking forward to the re-watch.",Mr. Right

Wonderful movie, wonderful actors. Sit back and enjoy and leave your world behind. Clearly the promoters didn't understand the movie business, when they did not back this excellent film.",Mr. Right

I love Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell and they're ability to play of each other's comedy is great, but he's a lot older than her so that was odd. And ""Knight and Day"" with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz was too close to the same concept and they did it better if I'm being honest. I don't feel this movie's plot was deep enough and the ending lacked excitement.",Mr. Right

176,cjolwebdesign-20-839486,Highly Underrated Action RomCom,7,28 September 2017,"It's the classic ""girl meets boy, girl falls for boy.."" kind of film; a basic paint-by-numbers Action Romantic Comedy, with telegraphed movie beats. However with Max Landis' quirky writing style injected into it, it becomes more than just the sum of its parts.It's funny, quirky, and action packed.Sam Rockwell (Mr. Right), Anna Kendrick (Martha), Tim Roth (Hopper) and RZA (Shotgun Steve) are the real standouts for me in this outing. And who knew RZA was so *censored* funny!?Speaking of Rockwell and Kendrick, their on-screen chemistry is almost palpable, and for that reason alone you should watch this movie. If you liked ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" and ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", you'll enjoy this cinematic experience as much as I did.",Mr. Right
177,kevschwaller,I laughed out loud way too many times,9,19 April 2016,"I saw the trailer a couple weeks ago and knew I wanted to watch just to see Anna Kendrick. I just now finished the movie and I'm impressed with the whole cast. The movie is not very original (i.e any killer couple movie), but the humor is absolutely spot on. It's very sarcastic and just over the top dumb, and I absolutely loved it. Sam and Anna have fantastic chemistry and really work off each other. I found myself pausing just so I could laugh about how ridiculous some things were. And all in a good way. It's a little violent if you aren't into that, but all in a very light tone. If you're in the mood for a silly comedy that isn't super raunchy or sexual, this is the perfect one. I loved it. I honestly would love to see a sequel, or hopefully Sam and Anna work together again in the future.",Mr. Right
178,AmonStarrick,Decent killer parody,6,19 January 2019,"The movie shows a woman (Anna Kendrick) with a boring life. After her boyfriend cheats on her, she loses it and falls into depression. Then she meets Mr. Right (Sam Rockwell), who seems to share a similar personality. You could call their characters weird and slightly crazy.What she doesn't know at first is, that Mr. Right is a professional killer. Besides their interactions and the love story that's filled with comedic moments, a former companion of Mr. Right (Tim Roth) and a wannabe gangster and his thugs try to kill the crazy hitman.The action in this movie is alright till good. It isn't overloaded with cuts and overall pleasently edited. It is fast paced and at some points quite violent, but still not overwhelming.The movie does not take itself seriously at all and the main source of entertainment comes from the comedy. The movie plays with typical gangster and agent movie cliches. And that is arguably the best part of the film. It shows scenes you never see in action movies and it also shows how awkward stuff can be. Sadly a lot of jokes do not work.The acting is decent, but not that outstanding, since the roles don't offer that much. Still nothing you would call bad or unconvincing.Pros:Decent actingA fun parody on action moviesA good humorGreat character dynamicCons:Flat storyJokes do not always workMight be a bit forgetableConclusion:It's definitely a fun movie to watch on a saturday evening. Overall it entertains and leaves you in a good mood. But it probably won't stay in your head for long.Rating: 68/100, 6/10",Mr. Right

180,LowTekGuy,Sam Rockwell could turn A Clockwork Orange into When Harry Met Sally,7,21 April 2016,"Not since Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a screenwriter tried to bolt so much violence onto a rom-com chassis. **mild spoilers ahead*** This is one of those films that's almost more psychology experiment than entertainment, trying to see how far your suspension of disbelief can be stretched before it snaps. For instance, can two people on a date eat hot dogs together then go snuff out some thugs? Sure, why not? Can a couple make out by throwing knives at each other's heads to see if they have a kindred level of eye-hand coordination? Kinky, but we'll allow it.Anna Kendrick seems to be channeling Jesse Eisenberg throughout, though she is far too adorable and quick-witted for us to hold that against her. But the great Sam Rockwell is what this flick is all about. He's the reason to watch it from start to finish. Talk about ""Mr. Right,"" here is an actor who makes everything right about every movie he's in, every time. Even one in which he is 17 years older than his leading lady!

I love this movie from the opening credits and ""Have a nice day!"" to ""Whatcha looking at?""""One of you hussies is getting fisted.""""What if it was a bullet?

I have difficulty understanding human connections and emotion, so the apparent lack of ""normal"" here spoke to my soul. Francis' (but don't call him that) brain damage leaves him still so much more organized than Martha Agatha's resident inner chaos, and he recognizes he's just the partner to help her harness it.I have trouble with speaking, turning thought into speech, so it is wonderful to me to see people being witty, or corny, back and forth and I know that it's scripted but it's something that is out of reach for me and so I ache for it.

This wasn't given a real theatrical release and it's plain to see why. How Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick, and Tim Roth were coaxed into this mess will forever be a mystery. Universal probably gave it to Netflix for free, begging to clear it off the shelf of movies not meant to see the light of day.
Max Landis, even before the MeToo movement that came knocking on his door, was on borrowed time as a benefactor of industry nepotism and scarcely a shred of talent. This movie's script proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt.

It had great music right from the start, quirky humor, weird but cute characters you fall in love with as fast as they fall for each other, smooth action and slow motion scenes, and even the plot, as ridiculous as it is, has a nice progression and satisfying ending as well. I really enjoyed the romantic part and how the two characters fit together, and the relationship jokes just make it even more special ****** SPOILER ALERT****** (""You say that now, but then in the car you'll be like..."").

Thankfully, this film was completely refreshing, and ended up being one of my favourites of the festival.I've always liked Anna Kendrick, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed or appreciated her work this much. She was totally on the ball and hilarious, and she and Sam Rockwell make an unexpectedly perfect couple. The comedy was on point throughout the movie, and the jokes were awesome and very original. You fall in love with the characters and as strange as the plot is, the love story between them is very believable.Although it's about a hit-man and of course there's a lot of killing in it, it's not too gory, so I'd say most people could handle it even if they're somewhat faint of heart. Definitely go see it. It's well worth your while, and I think it will be considered one of the best comedies of the year.",Mr. Right
191,dogvilledk,Shallow,3,12 April 2016,"First review, sadly it has to be a harsh one.What really rubbed me was, that the movies dialog between our lead actors, which was so snappy it felt like I was watching an action'ie version of Gilmore Girls, had no natural feel to it, at all. That, combined with a most unlikely love scenario, made it a 90 minute waste of my life......Why o why did I keep watching?!Well I probably hoped Sam Rockwell or Tim Roth would've brought it home, they just didn't, IMO. Watch it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you!",Mr. Right
192,jackiemartinkc,Netflix 3/27/2020 during Corona Virus Voluntary Quarantine,10,27 March 2020,"I loved this movie. It was sweet, suspenseful, funny, and romantic. I was completely distracted from reality. The lead actress and leading man were believable. Thanks for the uplifting experience.",Mr. Right
193,bhubonpaul,It's really a good combination of action and comedy,9,24 August 2019,It's a good movie.i laughed many times when i seeing this movie. You will see how love can change people and doing crazy things that's all i can say about it. Happy watching,Mr. Right
194,stefdemile,Very funny,9,10 March 2018,"Okay, it's not a perfect movie. But I laughed out loud, in the theatre. I spit Pepsi out my nose. At the end of the day, isn't that why you go to a comedy? As a bonus, I also liked the characters - Sam Rockwell is always pretty great, and he manages to be a psychokiller that you love and root for in this one. And Anna Kendrick can do no wrong, in this film, or any other. This is just an enjoyable romp, well worth watching.",Mr. Right
195,narosales,FREAKIN' AWESOME!!,9,16 May 2021,"Movies rarely keep me fully entertained........ literally had an ""awww"" dreamy smile pasted on my face throughout the whole movie. LOVED IT!!!!",Mr. Right
196,tmcginnity-01882,Really Fun!,9,29 September 2019,I saw that this was given a low rating of 6.3 and nearly didn't watch it. Delighted I listened to my girlfriend and watched it! Very fun for an evening in !!,Mr. Right
197,anitamcgill,Haha murdering people is funny,4,15 April 2020,"The premise of this movie just doesn't work. As entertaining as Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are to watch, I just couldn't find myself to like the movie because the tone is just off. The writing is also kinda bad at times with awkward dialogue. What a shame.",Mr. Right
198,ToLeaveNoTurnUnstoned,Just took #1 on my Top 10 of all time!,10,11 April 2020,"From the get go I was sold on this movie! Sam Rockwell is a living legend and Anna Kendrick is a real life Disney Princess that has a mouth like a drunken sailor. Everything about this movie is gold to me! I have personally started using the line ""it's a conscious decision...I'm completely f*n bananas!"" as my motto in life. I wish this story line would spawn many sequels but alas I'm sure I am the only one to probably feel that way.",Mr. Right
199,jamessrq,"Quirky, action fun",9,29 April 2020,"Definitely will only appeal to those that can appreciate the quirky characters and humor. The acting was perfect in my book. Even the minor characters got me engaged. Contains violence that may disturb some since it is not taken seriously. But it is a movie that is a diversion from the mundane, serious world. Unexpectantly this has become one of my favorite guilty pleasure movies right next to ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"". Do not watch if violence bothers you, though.",Mr. Right
200,brad2385,"cheesy,unfunny, and nonsensical",3,26 October 2020,"The movie starts off bad and only gets worse. The plot is terrible, which I might have been able to overlook if the movie was actually funny. It wasnt. Unless you like simple cheesy humor, you might not laugh the entire movie. I was begging for the end by the midway point.",Mr. Right
201,william-elsley,Great fun movie with loads of good actors,9,16 July 2018,"This is a wonderful film with all you need for an entertaining dark comedy. Brilliantly acted by Anna, Sam and Tim as the main characters and a script that keeps you riveted all the way. Wonderful fun highly recommended. Also see ""Happy Death Day"" and the ""Accountant"" for a more serious but still entertaining film.",Mr. Right
202,www-affinity-pw,Overrated mess,4,9 May 2016,"Is the movie worth watching? Sam stars in it and tries to save it so maybe for fans of his like myself. Is it worth paying to see it in the cinema? NO. Wait for a free TV slot or a bargain bin DVD.You have ingredients for a great movie; great male lead, humor, dance/fight choreographing, action but it ended up in a mess. Director and DOP were more interested in playing with light in many scenes than anything else. Fight scenes were poor, leading lady was not believable not in serious scenes (when she witnesses a murder) and was not funny in comedy scenes.Was it a direction problem or is she just not leading lady material? She was great in Up in the Air, but I don't think she has what it takes to be a great actress.",Mr. Right
203,mrbaalloo,Quirky Comedy With Some Morals,10,24 June 2018,I love this movie! It's a light-hearted comedy with some fun twists on common moral dilemmas that add to make up a fun movie that I could watch many times.,Mr. Right
204,rich-972-255393,It's like a book you can't put down,8,26 February 2020,Rockwell and Kendrick just click as a pair of hilarious psychos. Watching them was one of the most fun hour and a halves I've had in a long time. They've played the wacky ones in the room before but as solos. Here they are the perfect wacky duet and play it throughout.,Mr. Right
205,sallymelville11,HORRIBLE,1,26 February 2020,"This is the worst movie ever. I'm embarrassed for the only worthwhile actor who appears in it - Anson Mount. The writing, the acting, the actors and the plot reek of immaturity and making a quick buck. I couldn't watch more than half an hour and then only because I was trying to be polite to my boyfriend who inadvertently put it on without knowing what it was 'just to fall asleep to'. Well he sure fell asleep, and I fell sick with disgust. Avoid at all costs!!!!",Mr. Right
206,shiprock-1,This movie is so bad!!!!!,1,17 April 2016,"I love Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick and Tim Roth. Could not wait to watch this. It was preposterously bad. Makes you wonder how such talented people would agree to be in such a film, and deliver such putrid performances.I am extremely resentful that not only did I pay to see this, but lost the 2 hours of my life in doing so.Spare yourself...do not be fooled! Avoid this movie.Avoid this like the plague.As much as I enjoyed American Ultra, I equally hated this.Resentfully hated this.",Mr. Right
207,dmentia666,Best movie I have seen all year,10,17 November 2021,"This is easily Rockwell's best acting, even better than Galaxy Quest, and I had only previously seen Kendrick in The Last Five Years so she has gone up dramatically in my estimation. I have watched this movie about 10 times now, I even keep it playing just for the soundtrack while playing games.",Mr. Right
208,lyndseyannallman,Ohh Sam Rockwell!!,7,12 April 2016,"I have always been a huge fan of Sam Rockwell so I was super excited when I seen this trailer. Anyway without spoiling anything that actually happens in the movie I will say that the film was very enjoyable and was heightened by Sam's believable performance as a quirky yet sexually charged loner hit man. His performance along with Anna's was a right fit, her character was aloof but just as quirky as Sam's, so the relationship they formed throughout the movie made sense, surprisingly! I have to admit I had dreaded looking at her with him in this film but the script was witty, funny and made me laugh a lot, so seven out of ten! The reason I knock 3 off is because of that awful knife scene with Anna and Anna's slow progression within the action scenes annoyed me. OHH AND THE LACK OF NUDITY..SAM! LOL",Mr. Right
209,davidmooreapple,over all a brilliant film,8,11 April 2016,I must say i have never seen this or heard of this film until my wife mentioned it and i thought it was a film i wouldn't watch but i did and it was really good. It has everything its funny romantic and a tad crazy and wired but i enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who wouldn't normally watch this type of film. i have only seen two films with Sam Rockwell in but he is a great actor and and i will watch more movies with him in and Anna Kendrick plays her role excellently and is awesome all her acting roles especially in pitch perfect me and my wife watch that film a lot.this film is now part of my top five of all time Armageddon being number one.,Mr. Right
210,singletonlisa,Hilarious,10,11 May 2017,"My husband and I stop whatever we are doing and watch this movie when it comes on. The writing is sharp and witty. All the actors do such a great job (Love watching Sam and Anna together - there's a spark!) I can't believe this movie hasn't gotten more buzz. We quote this show all the time ""I'm a T Rex"" ""Yah, we met at the office"". I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a funny, quirky movie, to just laugh and be silly with. Oh, yah there is the killing stuff, but that can be funny, right?",Mr. Right
211,billiards-82240,A very pleasant surprise,9,7 July 2017,A really endearing thrill-ride of an action romantic comedy. Could have been an awful film if not for the perfect casting. I wasn't expecting much but I was smiling all the way through. Chimes with the millennial quarter-life crisis epidemic.Enjoy this film on a rough day/hangover.,Mr. Right
212,nickavero,great film,10,30 June 2017,"I loved it,it was hilarious and fun to watch it was so good I laughed several times;but I love every Anna Kendrick film It was too good to end I can't wait for mr.right 2 Anna Kendrick was extremely Fun to watch,I've watched it Like 5 times and it gets Better each time,great romcom Which was more com than rom Loved it loved it Loved it Loved it loved it Loved it Loved it loved it Loved it Loved it loved it Loved it",Mr. Right
213,kathryns_mail,Kendrick & Rockwell work well,9,26 December 2018,"A good movie that blends action and romantic comedy lines for a black comedic rebound love story.
The story line gets a little confusing around the start as to who's who, but ultimately pays off a surprising conclusion.",Mr. Right
214,hiswatus,"Funny movie, not to be taken too seriously",9,16 August 2017,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. At first I was kinda grossed out because the lead man is way older than the lead woman, but it kind of fits the relationship as it progresses. All the actors are great picks and do a really good job, especially Anna Kendrick, Sam Rockwell and Tim Roth. Both lead characters are obviously kind of crazy and it's fine, and it works well! I really enjoyed this movie.",Mr. Right
215,rfinsley,Unexpectedly hilarious!,10,29 December 2017,"It's weird to say, but this movie made me so happy. It is by far my favorite Anna Kendrick roll. She was so quirky and endearing at the same time. Can't believe it doesn't have a higher rating. I've never reviewed a film before, but I enjoyed it so much, I felt compared to share.",Mr. Right
216,chloe-church,"I started out unimpressed, but ended up really liking it.",7,25 August 2019,"My reservations at the beginning of this movie were simply that, in the early romantic comedy scenes, Rockwell (whom I love) is simply too old for Anna Kendrick. The actors are 16 years apart, but Kendrick looks young for her age and Rockwell looks old* for his age, magnifying the effect.But, as the film descends into utter madness, you realize that these two super hero/super villain/ psychos are perfect for each other, and with interests so...unusual...they would never find anyone else, so bless 'em.Watch this if, against your better judgment, you're always a little sad that Veronica & JD don't end up together at the end of Heathers. Oh, and RZA is an under-appreciated acting talent.*But he's a great little dancer.",Mr. Right
217,melkennedy-05060,Just good fun,10,28 February 2018,"I accidentally found this movie on a plane, and the flight was just under being long enough and sought out to rewatch from the start as it captured me! I really liked this movie, I like it so much I literally created a log in to say so. My review isnt funny, witty or relevant in any way but I feel like this movie is something you should give a go as you might find yourself laughing and bopping along!The sound track is so up beat and the characters are wacky but enjoyable. I sometimes play this movie in the background while I'm pottering around just because it makes me happy! Although I think the two leads are the oddest couple ever, somehow they make it work. Overal all, super enjoyable and perky. Please just watch it",Mr. Right

The only character that was remotely bearable was Steve and he had 5 min screen time.
I should have just ended my misery and pause the movie but i watched it til the end and it only got WORSE.
This is my first review and I usually don't do this, but I felt the need to warn my fellow humans.",Mr. Right
219,sandraamakaduru,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,10,4 September 2019,"This movie was a cinematic masterpiece. It has the perfect amount of humor and action all rolled in one. The wacky main character finds her Mr. Right, who turns out to be a hit man with an unusual sense of morality. This movie would be perfect for those with a cynical sense of humor, and people who love the gore that comes with action movies. To top it off, the film has the most hilariously perfect couple with the weirdest love story. It's an amazing movie, I'd highly recommend.",Mr. Right
220,alexandershort,"Absurdly implausible, gut-giggling, ridiculous but romantic!",10,23 September 2019,"So if you need cheering up, suspend everything and watch the absurdly implausible, gut-giggling, ridiculous but romantic Mr Right!
Sam Rockwell rocks as a screw-loose hitman - and it's nice to see him playing lead not just that whiny annoying character that paid his rent.
Tim Roth does Tim Roth in just the right measure. And RZA pulls the perfect punches in his cameo as ""Steve"". All with beautiful New Orleans as a backdrop for no other reason, it feels, than why not?
I don't like formulaic romcoms but the writer changed it up a bit with this - Max Landis landing just the right mix with this action-romcom. Paco Cabezas directs a very diverting hour and a half!",Mr. Right
221,chimamandaanie,Stunning,10,30 December 2019,"I really feel this movie was neglected, people rarely talk about it but it's honestly stunning. It's honest, it's comedy, it's action, it's thrill, it's love. It's gorgeous.
I can't explain it but it leaves you with a thrill when you watch it. I just finished watching it and I'm watching it again. I am not a fan of impulse moments but this shows that some impulse moments lead to amazing things, this movie. Stunning.",Mr. Right

If you went in expecting Love, Actually then you are going to be disappointed, but if you're looking for a feel-good movie about finding and accepting yourself and finding someone who you can be that person with, this is AMAZING.

230,ajolielips18,Loved this movie and its unique crazy story!,10,26 October 2016,"It quirky, untraditional, unique and crazy. That is the best part about this movie. Do not go into this thinking its the traditional romantic comedy. Thats what makes it good. Sam Rockwell knocked it out of the park so did Anna Kendrick. Their chemistry is charming and cute. RZA was excellent lol loved the blunt rolling on the hood of his car! Someone mentioned earlier this movie lacked a villain to ""like."" However there were many villains lol The main to like was Tim Roth! By the end of the movie you now realize they will forever be against villains. Kind of makes you want a sequel of them kicking ass together. Someone mentioned ""laziness"" because of the ending credits being times new roman pt12. Honestly if this movie was budgeted, who cares if the ending credits weren't some special font. The money went were it was needed and the special effects were pretty cool. The heart of the movie is gold. Get off the high horse of, ""bad ending credits,"" and ""Directing sucked."" Enjoy the movie the heart is gold even if the head of it is twisted and crazy. lol",Mr. Right
231,passing_lives,"Awfully childish, unrealistic and without a point",1,6 July 2016,"I played this movie with my mom, she asked me to play some light interesting movie, and we ended up wasting the whole evening on this.Shortly said, if you want to see one of those movies which show no point whatsoever, are completely unrealistic, contain terrible acting and no specific story to get you thrilled, then this is the movie for you.Yes, for sure you'll enjoy the action parts (at least some of them) if you're a fighting fan, but even that will look too fake.I wish I could take back the time spent watching this movie.

233,Draebsi,The rom-com version of American Ultra,7,14 April 2016,"Max Landis' writing is unique and has both hits and misses. This movie succeeds in part with the impressive tonal shifts in the story as well as some original characters.The movie plays like a Diablo Cody-thing gone off the rails, which is a good thing, if you're prepared for that kind of stuff.The action was unexpectedly well executed, but hard to really be engaged with because of the chaotic approach to genre.If you're into something light and fun and tired of the tropes being played over and over again, then this is the next film, you should watch.",Mr. Right

241,ekathleen06,Disturbing,2,22 October 2016,"I wanted to like this film, as I'm a fan of romantic comedies, a fan of Anna Kendrick's other works. There were parts in the beginning that were cute and funny, but when the action started to heat up, I was seriously disturbed by both her and Sam Rockwell's characters. The characters' nonchalant, giddy approach to killing people was unsettling, particularly when you see ""Martha"" giggling and smiling to herself after she commits her very first murder. I watched, completely unnerved, wondering how audiences are probably cheering on this sociopath protagonist.Again, I wanted to like the film, and of course I realize that it's fictional and meant for entertainment. But ultimately, I personally couldn't see beyond the ""I just killed someone and it felt so good! Hehe. Aren't you proud of me?"" depiction. In the end, I was left very disturbed.",Mr. Right

It had the perfect combination of heartfelt love and on the edge of your seat suspense. I loved it. The writer and rector have done an amazing job on this movie. I would give it a 10/10 any day of the week. I highly recommend it. There was some cursing and some people get killed very visibly on the screen. I recommend it for ages 14 plus.

She's slightly mad and he's, well, definitely mad! I loved how director Paco Cabezas focused on Sam's dance or fight moves. The soundtrack is great, it's lively and snappy. Tim Roth, my goodness, that accent is terrible! Great choreography throughout. You cannot take the cast in this movie seriously and nor should you so don't expect 007, expect a laugh and clever features it will not disappoint",Mr. Right
251,racojohn-96452,Mr. Wrong,4,8 April 2016,"What sounds like a movie with a good premise with Sam Rockwell, who is one of my favorites, turns out to be too goofy and outlandish. Is it a superhero movie? It should be. If the movie makers made a funny, gritty flick out of this - in the same vein as a 48 Hours or True Romance - this could have worked. Instead it's another Rush Hour or Ride Along with Superman mixed in - unbelievable and impossible situations with wise- cracking characters. There are scenes that aren't even funny and absolutely implausible. We are supposed to believe that Anna Kendrick's character can, in a minute, learn to catch knives thrown at her. That is an impossible feat for anybody - ever - but she does it. She also finds out she can fight like a Ninja and kill like a trained assassin without any lessons whatsoever. Sam Rockwell blocks a shotgun blast with his hand. This movie is an insult to peoples intelligence and isn't that funny to make up for it. I generously give it 4 stars just because the 2 lead actors are likable. Anson Mount is misused in this mess also.",Mr. Right

If you are looking for a good movie for date night, or just love action and comedy, this is the movie for you. Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick were perfect choices for this movie. I can not see anyone else pulling these crazy characters off as well as these two have done. I gave this movie a 7 because it had some bad language and I noticed the revolvers being used in the movie were obviously empty. Had it not been for these two factors, I would have given the movie a higher rating. Still a fun movie to watch, and I definitely recommend watching this movie.",Mr. Right

There is no other way to put it than that you will have the most crazy fun time ever watching this movie. It finds the perfect balance of serious and crazy, fast and slow, action and romance and humor. Totally worth going out to see regardless of where it is playing. Drove forty five minutes just to see this movie, and I am one-hundred percent positive that I will be back next week to do it all over again.",Mr. Right
254,rebeccastella,One of my new favourite movies of all time,10,10 April 2016,"I genuinely loved every second of it. Such a fantastic film. I was worried it was going to be another cliché love film but it was great. It had the sweetness of films like ""Benny and Joon"", where two oddballs fall for each other, and empowerment that comes from accepting that being a bit crazy might be what makes you a bad- ass! It's similar to ""Knight and Day"" in premise but with a more fierce female lead character. The characters are all compelling and I definitely had soft spots for Steve and Hopper. The ending left me with a huge smile on my face. It's feel good film for anyone who loves quirky people (fictional or real).",Mr. Right
255,cdubyatube,Mr. Right... ON!,9,12 April 2016,"Anna Kendrick was Hilarious, Sam Rockwell gives a stellar performance, as usual, and The RZA plays my favorite character and also delivers an exceptional performance and Tim Roth is, well... Tim Roth... need I say more? Overall this movie is awesome. Watch it alone or with your significant other, either way it's a solid movie. If you like action packed movies with Anna Kendrick being as adorable as ever, (Anna if you're reading this, call me) Sam Rockwell being his usual Charismatic self and The RZA putting the (expletive deleted) on the CHAIN WAX... then this is one flick you ought not to miss. Seriously... stop reading and watch this movie.",Mr. Right
256,rowandax-19060,Best film of 2016 so far...,9,30 June 2016,"Both of the lead cast make a great impression. The story while tried and true, doesn't fail. The two leads are as charismatic as one would hope. Tim Roth is excellent as always. It's a great film for lovers or those wishing to love. I rate this higher than Marvel's latest (Captain America Civil War). I need to add more apparently. This film instilled within me an actual desire to go out and find your other half. And apparently keep shooting zombies until you find your special someone. So without do we shall shoot shoot shoot zombies for no reason at all. All those melted faces how might I trace it. To what is what I wish to hear. Yet doth not of a yet to hear. Have I made ten lines out of fear? Or shall my shallow child who has nothing to do with a simple review remain in tear?",Mr. Right
257,trnhope,A RomCom starring the Joker and Harley Quinn,9,17 July 2016,"Mr. Right is a very enjoyable movie starring Anna Kendrick as a quirky, mentally unstable paleontologist who has excellent chemistry with Sam Rockwell's equally unbalanced reformed hit-man. The lead couple is great, and the supporting characters are intriguing and developed, and played well by the actors. Kendrick's roommate Sophie is especially humorous, as she appears to be the only sane person in the film.The movie depicts and unhealthy relationship between two mentally, and emotionally, unwell people, but does it in a way that leaves you believing they are perfect match made by the powers that be.There is a fair amount of profanity, ranging from a$$ to C**t, and there is a lot of violence. The violence, however, is not nearly as bloody as it really should be, and is not gory for the most part. There is also no nudity.",Mr. Right
258,abraun-98566,Totally Underrated Movie,10,18 April 2021,This movie doesn't get enough credit. This movie is a favorite on my list and just fun to watch. Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick have such an amazing goofy chemistry. Just a reminder that there is someone for everyone!,Mr. Right
259,janey-93798,"Hilarious, crazy and just brilliant fun",10,3 March 2019,"This is one of my favourite films. I discovered it by accident and it is now my go to film if I need to laugh. It is very easy to watch and the two leads nail their characters.The film doesn't take itself seriously, it is just fun from start to finish.",Mr. Right
260,miss_cutiepie-89021,Awesome,10,3 July 2019,"I'm truly happy that I sign up for a subscription with HBO just to watch this movie. It's a keeper!! It is a total Romantic Comedy with some spice and action. Anna Kendrick character's excitement and dramatics kept me laughing. Sam Rockwell's character was great as well. Overall if you didn't like the movie then you most likely don't see the beauty in everyday life. Lol Just smile, laugh, and be happy!",Mr. Right
261,kianna-12779,I freakin love this movie!!,10,23 December 2020,"I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating! It's the best f*ing movie istg! It's funny, cute, has action and romance! And the acting is great! Seriously 10/10 would recommend.",Mr. Right
262,jadearmstrong-65415,It's weird and and wonderful.,10,30 September 2019,"Quirky, hilarious, Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are perfect comedy duo.",Mr. Right
263,anyamalarski,Greatest Movie Ever,10,10 April 2017,"Honestly, Its so great. Just so good, 20/10. Grab some snacks and some friends and watch this. You'll laugh for days. Its really funny, Anna Kendrick is perfect perfect for this role. Her relationship is something else of its own, they somehow work perfectly together. Probably because they are both psychopaths, Annas character twist is just surprising and yet not. I'd watch this a million and one times over.",Mr. Right
264,zart-05139,SO funny!,10,17 February 2020,"I came across this movie on Netflix and had no clue it existed. I love Anna Kendrick, so I figured we would give it a try. This action comedy is so fun! I legit laughed out loud throughout this movie. LOVED IT!!",Mr. Right
265,imgamer-13318,Worst movie I've seen so far this year (2017),1,16 July 2017,"OK, so it's a movie from 2015, but I was looking around for something to watch, and came across this movie.""Sure,"" I thought, ""What's not to like? It has Sam Rockwell (a genius in other movies), Tim Roth (ditto) and Anna Kendrick."" Later I found out that Anson Mount from Hell on Wheels is also in it! I felt bad for each and every one of them while watching this piece of garbage. I know they're getting paid well, but to have to try and act out these lines that are completely ridiculous and an insult to the intelligence of any poor sucker who actually paid for this movie, well, it must have been difficult. I hope they got paid well and the idiots who wrote and produced this movie lost their shirts.I'm a huge fan of good movies and TV shows. I appreciate quality acting, smart direction and above all, compelling writing. This movie had none of these qualities. Avoid at all costs.At least I didn't pay for it. I just wish I hadn't wasted the time to see it.",Mr. Right
266,benahobbs,Grosse Point Blank Redux,9,8 April 2020,"Contract killer, protagonist's conscience development, quirky love interest, other contract killer trying to kill the contract killer protagonist. All it needed was a high school reunion and it'd be a match. Rockwell is Cusack, Kendrick is Driver, Roth is Aykroyd.Overall, it's an enjoyable diversion from Hollywood monotony. Enjoy it for what it is, I did.",Mr. Right
267,llbook,never expected to like this,10,1 January 2018,"The most unexpected quirky charming tale, with lots of action and so funny! I had watched it twice and then started showing it to others. one person didnt like it and didnt get it, but everyone else loved it too. so watch it, superb acting and clever writing. yay for everyone who worked on the movie \\ has cult gem tattooed all over this lol",Mr. Right
268,astros-31896,Comes out of nowhere.,10,25 February 2020,"Fantastic movie, very funny and completely underrated. Do yourself a favor give this movie chance.",Mr. Right
269,erinfey,Once of the best romances I've seen in ages,10,11 September 2021,"Seriously. Once of the best romances I've seen in ages. Give it a shot: murder, mayhem, jokes, it's got it all.",Mr. Right
270,cdriddle,Setting the record straight,8,28 November 2018,"Disclaimer: I don't know how this thing was marketed. All the agro about a Tarantino derivation... don't know where that comes from but maybe some bad overmade studio trailer... anyway...Being funny is hard, right? Think about how many movies try and fail? Now let's wrap that into being funny while killing people? Like REALLY funny? They manage it here by layering ""workplace-comedy"" type dialogue on top of sweet, unconventional character types and rolling it up into some more than passable sexymatography. Everywhere a stereotype lurks, the film tweaks it's nipple and gives it some over the top charm. Shootuts in pouring rain are worthy of the matrix. It all bundles together to be very, very watchable.",Mr. Right
271,FCatus,An underrated piece of art!,8,21 November 2018,"I truly love this film and it is spectacular as well! All the actors' performance were brilliant, the concept and message of the film is quite innovative, fascinating, thought-provoking and inspiring for novels. Furthermore, the film is very humorous. This film is genuinely an underrated piece of art. Why is the rating so low and why are the stars so few. This film deserves at least a 7 out of 10 stars!To me, this is one of those few films that I would watch again and again, even though I'm not a fan of romance films.",Mr. Right
272,claire_birkumshaw,My all time favourite movie,10,4 June 2021,"Always makes me smile.Who doesn't love a hitman love story with a few laughs thrown in along the way. Will brighten any mood. Great cast, well scripted.",Mr. Right
273,gettiz-53787,Underrated movie gold,9,25 July 2020,"This movie is just pure gold. It has comedy, romance, action... Great actors too. Sam and Anna have awesome chemistry. This is a great movie for every occasion. Makes me wish I met some crazy killer. 😂I have been hoping for a sequel!",Mr. Right
