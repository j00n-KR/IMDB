0,MartinHafer,The scariest horror film I have ever seen,10,23 July 2006,"About the only classic horror film that even comes close to NOSFERATU in terror is the early sound film, FREAKS. Despite the ability to use modern appliances and technology to make extremely graphic horror movies today, the stuff being called horror just doesn't come close to these older films when it comes to setting a mood and scaring the pants off you.This version of Dracula is different from the Bram Stoker novel in several ways because the producers of the film didn't want to pay royalties! So, Dracula's name was changed to Dr. Orlock and the title itself was also changed. Otherwise, its a very similar movie. In fact, the plot is so close I won't even bother to give a summary other than to say that the way the vampire dies in the end is VERY different from other Dracula films (unless you see the 1979 remake of NOSFERATU, which, of course, is similar).Finally, I strongly recommend you try to watch Shadow of the Vampire, a movie starring John Malkovich where they recreate dramatically the story behind the film. All of Murnau's strange idiosyncrasies are revealed and this is a real great addition to the original film.So why is it so creepy? Well, like the 1931 version, it's filmed in glorious black and white--a must for good horror. Secondly, this Dracula is not the suave and handsome guy he is in some other films. In fact, he's downright awful! With a bald head, pointed ears, weird fangs that consist of his front two teeth and incredibly long, slender and pointed fingers, he is like a nightmare come to life!! Plus, and this is the absolutely creepiest part, his leaving his coffin early is the film will scare the life out of the viewer--as instead of bending his body to get up, he rises up vertically (they must have had someone underneath pushing him up to give this effect) and rats come pouring out of the coffin from his feet! This is a sight no other Dracula film can equal.The only negatives are the rather old-fashioned plot elements here and there. However, director F. W. Murnau (who made a career out of making magical and other-worldly images on film) did an amazing job in creating the mood and magic that was this film and these very minor problems can easily be forgiven.",Nosferatu
1,TheLittleSongbird,A masterpiece of expressionism and terror,10,17 August 2012,"Having loved Faust(1926) I realised I had never seen Nosferatu(1922), which was apparently even better. I could really kick myself, for Nosferatu is every bit as good as everybody says. As much as I did love Faust, I love Nosferatu even more. It plays loosely with the Dracula story but is just as effective. The film is atmospheric, and the scary scenes still pack a powerful punch, the finale with Orlock's shadow outside his victim's door is terrifying. The expressionistic images do look really beautiful, but not overly so to undermine the scares or the atmosphere. The restored version's music score is suitably haunting, and FW Murnau's direction is superb. But if anything is to be remembered long after Nosferatu is over, other than the ending, it is the performance of Max Schreck. He is mesmerising as Orlock, exuding great amounts of authority and making scenes all the more tense. And this is by his appearance alone, the grasping claws, pointed fangs and cadaverous white body is enough to give anybody nightmares.So all in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Nosferatu
2,Leofwine_draca,"A dusty, cobwebby delight",8,6 September 2016,"This landmark film is still considered a classic of the Gothic cinema to this day, despite being nigh on seventy years old. Casual viewers reared on the latest gore-drenched horror spectaculars will obviously find it difficult to enjoy this film, being as it's pretty dated. For instance, the print jumps repeatedly and bears many scratches. Even so, it's not in bad shape for a tiny film which was made ten years before Lugosi's Dracula, itself a feature which remains very dated, in some instances more so than this film. The silent nature of the film may put off other viewers, as the acting is all rather staged and more akin to mime than any realistic type of portrayal.The story itself is nothing original, being merely an unauthorised rip-off of Dracula. However what is original are the stylistic touches and visual flair which fills the film with a certain kind of Gothic dread, building up layer after layer of atmosphere through shadow work. The score, also, is brilliant, although I viewed it with James Bernard's new music. This, I feel, only added to the film, giving it a Hammer feel and a rich Gothic atmosphere, the music both moving and stirring, and most of all thrilling.However it's the character of Nosferatu himself that sticks in the mind, brilliantly and spookily played by the German Max Schreck. Nosferatu is a hideously ugly, inhuman fiend, more like a demon than a handsome man, such as the one Christopher Lee used to play. There are many scenes which were later on to become clichéd through overuse in the horror genre (for instance, watch SALEM'S LOT for a feeling of déjà vu), but in this film they are all fresh and interesting. The hand crawling from the coffin, the sudden shock of Nosferatu raising himself from his coffin in the ship's hold, all of these moments are so obviously influential on the films of today. As is the classic image of Nosferatu's stiff shadow climbing the staircase, or the clever special effect where he disappears in the sunlight at the end.While admittedly slow and dated, Nosferatu easily overcomes these flaws by being a beautifully-made, intelligent adaptation of the Dracula novel, which, unlike many, many latter day productions, still has the ability to provoke fear, and that's saying something for a dusty old film made before even our grandparents were alive. Powerful and brooding in equal measure.",Nosferatu
3,SnoopyStyle,Horror icon,9,1 May 2014,"There was a Great Death in 1838 Wisborg, Germany. Real estate agent Knock has associated himself with some kind of evil. He sends young associate Hutter to Count Orlok in Transylvania who claims to want to buy a house. Hutter leaves behind his scared wife Ellen as he travels the dangerous untamed roads. When he gets to Orlok's castle, he finds it creepy while the locals warn him of werewolves. Eventually he has enough of Orlok and escapes. Meanwhile Orlok having purchased the house is now coming to Wisborg.This movie has a lot of iconic images like Max Schreck's Count Orlok. It's also throwing everything in here like the bugs and venus flytraps. The movie has set up all the basic cinematic visuals from the classic Bram Stoker novel. The effects are terrific for its time. For a silent movie, it is actually very enjoyable to watch. There is good tension and compelling drama.",Nosferatu
4,Hitchcoc,Perhaps the Ugliest Vampire of All Time,9,16 March 2006,"I love the Dracula story. I have seen the Lugosi one so many times. The book has always been a favorite. This one has withstood the test of time wonderfully. First of all, make the Count (who goes by another name to avoid copyright infringement) about as ugly and unbent as one can be (he looks like he has pole shoved through his body), throw in the Carpathians and the Borgo Pass, and you have the makings of a delightful film. Harker is such a putz as he laughs his way into the culture of the Transylvanians. He is so cocky and sure of himself, walking confidently up to the castle. That doesn't last long. One look at Max Schrek and all those fine thoughts go right out the window. Escaping, he makes his way back to his home while the Count goes about his business. The ship, of course, has lost its entire crew and a stowaway was being investigated. The Captain tied himself to the wheel. As the evil arrives, the plague takes over the city. A weird character named Renfield is eating flies and spiders and seems to have a connection to the Count. I always remember the ""stark raving mad"" Dwight Fry who came to London with the Lugosi Dracula, with his haunting laugh. This is an older man who looks about as bizarre as a person can look. This is one of the charms of the silent piece. These people appear so strange. Even the more conventional characters: Harker, his wife Nina (to avoid Mina, of course) just look so strange. I know it's a silent film and faces needed oodles of makeup to be seen properly by the camera. But if I saw Nina on the street, I'm not so sure I wouldn't run the other way. It all gets resolved with great sacrifice. The story is a great one and despite some of the missing sensuality, it works quite well. It must have been quite a sight in its day.",Nosferatu
5,Horst_In_Translation,A vampire classic,6,22 September 2015,"This is Murnau's take on the famous Dracula tale and it is exactly these films that made Germany such a successful nation in terms of silent movies. They did not have the quality or quantity like France or the United States when it came to very early silent short films, but in terms of feature films they are right there at the top. ""Metropolis"" is probably the most known example, but ""Nosferatu"" follows right behind. This one was made when vampires did not sparkle in the sun, but actually die if they do not make it into their coffin quickly.There are several runtimes listed here, but the version I saw had slightly over 1.5 hours, which is the longest and the most common as well. This is a silent movie, so all the music and sound effects (the cock noise near the end) was added later on to make this a better viewing experience. In my opinion it does improve the material, but that is a choice that everybody has to make on his own. In any case, the story is such a memorable and fascinating one that even legendary German filmmaker Werner Herzog produced his own approach to the tale starring Kinski, Ganz and Adjani over 50 years later and changing some of the names as well (Hutter became Harker).But back to this 1922 version: It's actually not that long anymore until she has its 100th anniversary. In my opinion, the best parts were the ones that included Nosferatu. Of course his presence was felt during the entire movie, but it was just so much more effective when he was seen, which he was not for almost the entire second half of the film, which is why I guess I preferred the first half. Plague references rounded the whole picture and personal tragedies up nicely, so I imagine people back in the first half of the 20th century were genuinely scared back then. People today probably are not that scared anymore, despite the gruesome looks of Nosferatu, because of the way the medium of film, and horror films as well, have developed over the last 90 years. Still, all in all a pretty good movie and I recommend it.",Nosferatu
6,Prismark10,Creepy Count,6,1 October 2016,"In some ways F W Murnau's Nosferatu an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker's book is in many ways a faithful adaptation of the Dracula story. What stands out is the grotesque vision of Max Schreck's Count Orlok who infuses this story with dread and creepiness as the film is shot in light, shadows and German Expressionism.What lets the film down though is some exaggerated acting from some of the actors who dial the ham up, Max Schreck not withstanding. The pace is leaden at times and made worse as this was an extended version of the film I watched.Still this film brought something extra to the table as far as the horror genre is concerned and Shreck's characterisation has stood the test of time.",Nosferatu
7,claudio_carvalho,A Masterpiece of the German Expressionism,10,24 September 2003,"Yesterday I watched again Nosferatu, now on DVD and with a soundtrack 5.0 played in an organ. Again I got hypnotized with such a wonder: what else can be said about this outstanding movie? I have not read other comments from IMDB, but this gothic and terrifying movie, based on Bram Stocker's Dracula, remains as a masterpiece of the history of the cinematographic industry and of the German Expressionism. I only regret that the (expensive) DVD released in Brazil has not restored the images, having basically the same quality of the VHS. My vote is ten.",Nosferatu
8,classicsoncall,"Nosferatu! That name alone can chill the blood!""",10,10 December 2005,"It's incredible to view a film over eighty years old with no special effects and very little in the way of makeup inspire the kind of dread and foreboding as found in director F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"". Max Schreck defines the title character with his skeletal features and long spider like fingers, a haunting figure that defies an earlier captioned description as a rich man who's free with his money. The mood is set early, his homeland of Transylvania is a land of phantoms where evil spirits become powerful after dark.Jonathon Harker's quest to bring Count Orlok/Nosferatu/Count Dracula back to Bremen is beset with nightmare, heralded by Harker's first meeting with the Count. There is nothing subtle about Schreck's portrayal when Harker cuts himself slicing bread, Nosferatu literally jumps at him to taste blood. When Harker examines his appearance in a mirror the following morning, the doom he is about to face appears as two trace like punctures on his neck.The film uses a number of animal symbols, but unlike the more familiar ""Dracula"" film of 1933, bats and wolves are missing here; instead we have an early appearance of a hyena outside Nosferatu's castle. Rats and spiders are used repeatedly, and for added measure, a lab scene in Bremen features a study of a Venus fly trap catching a fly, highlighting the ""vampire"" of the vegetable kingdom.The first time Harker manages a glimpse of Nosferatu in his earthen coffin aboard ship, the image offered is truly one of horror and fear, accentuated by the mere appearance of eyes and a partial face. It's repeated for added effect later on, when Harker opens a door to find a demon like, hideous visage in full form. How much is left to the imagination to see the shadow of Nosferatu climb the stairs while stalking Nina Harker? The implied terror is captured in one of the all time great images of silent film history.There are very few movies that I would consider ""must see"", Nosferatu falls into that category from the perspective of it's historical importance to the horror genre and it's impact on vampire lore in film. More is conveyed via menacing shadows, stark imagery and the revelation of vampire history than in reels full of many of the computer generated horror fests of present day.",Nosferatu
9,gavin6942,"The First Dracula, and One of the Greatest",8,3 October 2010,"In a blatant ripoff of ""Dracula"", Count Orlok (Max Schreck) moves from Transylvania to Germany, where he sets up base... only to raise havoc wherever he goes, with death and destruction in his wake.""Nosferatu"" is a great film, and a must-see for any horror fan or film historian. The film is legendary not only for its early portrayal of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but the legal battle that ensued -- at one point, all copies were ordered destroyed, so it is a small miracle the film exists today at all.Max Schreck has been memorialized for his role as Orlok (and for a fictionalized account of this, see ""Shadow of the Vampire""). Alexander Granach, the actor who plays Knock (a Renfield knockoff), is also excellent. Director F. W. Murnau would go on to make the critically acclaimed ""Sunrise"", but he was already experimenting with camera tricks here, and I daresay this is his better-known film. Truly a masterpiece, both then and now.Numerous versions of the film exist for the reason that it is in the public domain, and various degrees of quality come with them -- some are cleaned up better, have different intertitles, and drastically different scores. I do not have a strong enough knowledge to suggest one over another other than to say the Netflix version is not among the best. Also, if you care about quality, avoid watching it in a box set -- as little restoration as possible has been done on those versions.",Nosferatu
10,lee_eisenberg,inter-war German cinema,10,21 September 2005,"Something that unfortunately seems to have been forgotten by many is that between WWI and the Third Reich, Germany made some impressive movies. The three that probably stand out the most are ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", ""Nosferatu"" and ""The Nibelungenlied"".The second one is still the epitome of a horror movie. Obviously, it was based on Bram Stoker's classic ""Dracula"", but put a surreal spin on it. Max Schreck, as the title character (whose name in the movie is Count Orlok), makes a scarier Dracula than Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, Frank Langella or Gary Oldman. His shaved head and long fingernails emphasize his mystique. Probably the best scene is when Count Orlok is walking up a staircase; his shadow on the wall becomes a form of horror in and of itself.All in all, ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"" is naturally a must for film historians and horror fans alike. Werner Herzog's 1979 remake was even better; they further developed the title character. And ""Shadow of the Vampire"" was also quite interesting.",Nosferatu
11,jboothmillard,"Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horrors",8,20 February 2009,"I had seen the Paul Whitehouse spoof in The Fast Show, so I recognised the villain of the piece whenever I saw clips, and I couldn't wait to see the full film. This was the first ever adaptation of Bram Stoker's Stoker's Dracula, the Bela Lugosi version came nine years later. I should note that this film wasn't authorised by Bram Stoker, so all names were changed for copyright reasons, so I have provided the film names, and new names, so you don't get confused. Anyway, basically Jonathon Harker/Hutter (Gustav Von Wangenheim) is going to the castle of Count Dracula/Orlock (Max Schreck) in Transylvania, to have him sign papers to buy a house next to his in Bremen. Harker soon realises he is in the company of a vampire, and even wakes with bite marks on his neck. He does manage to escape, and while recuperating in hospital, the Count, in his coffin, travels to his new house, and plans to have the blood of Jonathon's/Hutter's wife Nina/Ellen (Greta Schröder). With Dracula/Orlock in the town, a plague covers the town, and more people are becoming sick and dying in mysterious circumstances. Nina/Ellen read ""The Book of Vampires"", so she knew that Nosferatu (as he can be called) can be killed after the cock crows, and he dies stepping into the trapping sunlight. Also starring Alexander Granach as Knock/Renfield, John Gottowt as The Professor/Bulwer and Max Nemetz as Captain of the 'Demeter'. I recognised the many moments of the film, such as Nosferatu staring while reading the letter to sign, lying in his coffin, rising from it, walking on the ship, standing by the window, and his shadow the climbing the stairs, many considered great German expressionism. It may be a little shaky, black and white and silent, but it is a must see for fans of vampire films, or just films in general. It was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",Nosferatu
12,Woodyanders,Count Orlok is coming. And he's bringing death with him.,9,31 May 2018,"Hideous vampire Count Orlok (a genuinely creepy portrayal by Max Schreck) arrives in the town of Wisborg, Germany on a deserted ship. The count brings a bunch of disease-carrying rats with him and soon the town becomes beset with fear and death. Moreover, Orloff plans on putting the bite on fair damsel Ellen (the lovely Greta Schroder). Director F. W. Murnau adeptly crafts a powerfully brooding and unsettling gloom-doom atmosphere that's positively dripping with dread and decay. Moreover, Murnau makes excellent and exquisitely eerie use of both the desolate countryside surrounding Orlok's foreboding castle and the panic-stricken hamlet that's been ravaged by the plague. Alexander Granach has a maniacal ball as the unhinged Knock while Gustav von Wagenheim overplays it a bit as real estate agent Hutter. The sumptuous black and white cinematography by Fritz Arno Wagner and Gunther Krampf offers a wealth of striking visuals such as Orlok rising upright from his coffin and Orlok walking off the ship amidst a bunch of scurrying rats. However, this film completely belongs to Schreck's supremely terrifying bloodsucker: With his ghastly and grotesque rodent-like appearance, slow deliberate movements, and limited screen time, Orlok highly rates as one of the all-time great truly scary and unnerving movie monsters who once seen is impossible to forget. Essential viewing for horror fans and cinema lovers alike.",Nosferatu
13,ccthemovieman-1,"Nothing Much, Just Another Pretty Face",4,29 May 2006,"I was a bit disappointed in this. I had seen a few of visuals that are sometimes shown because ""Count Orlok"" is so bizarre-looking, so I finally decided to check this famous German silent film out and see what all the fuss was about. Well, it was much ado about nothing, frankly. Yes, Max Schreck as the Orlok-Dracula was fascinating to view. No one has ever quite duplicated his strange facial features in over 80 years of film-making, makeup or no makeup. That was worth some of the price of the rental, but the story wasn't. It just dragged too much and the other characters weren't much.I did learn a few things, however, about Bram Stoker's Dracula tale that I don't believe I have heard in other Dracula movies, such as how many and why coffins of dirt accompanied the Dracula on his voyage. That, and a few other tidbits, were interesting, as were the different colored tints on the some of the scenes.But, story-wise, it's a bit too dated and too slow for today's tastes, I'm afraid. Also, 84 minutes of a fairly-strong pounding of organ music can get to be a little much. Silent film purists will not like that last statement, as they seem to revere these scores, but, hey, all I can say is: ""bite me!""",Nosferatu
14,rmax304823,A True Original.,7,22 June 2010,"Never having read the novel, I don't know how closely this film follows Bram Stoker's tale, but it certainly sticks fairly closely to the narrative we've come to be familiar with from later movies.Renfield is a real estate broker in Bremen in 1838 and he sends agent Jonathan Harker to Graf Orlok's castle in Transylvania to close a sale on a dilapidated apartment complex in Bremen. Graf Orlok is Nosferatu, or Dracula. He's played by an actor called Max Schreck, which in German is a joke.Renfield is under his far-away spell, though Renfield's place in the plot is problematic, at least in this version. I mean, he's an agent of Nosferatu. So what? His thread is a dead end.At any rate, Harker makes the trip to the Carpathian Alps where he is warned by the peasants at the inn to avoid the Count's castle at night. Ha ha, laughs Harker.And actually Harker is pretty dumb. Nosferatu meets him at the castle entrance and, alright, this is a fantasy, but no normal human being would get within ten feet of Max Schreck. The creature is grotesque. He has no neck. His ears end in Darwinian points. His incisors look like hypodermic syringes. He wears these skinny trousers on his long legs so that he seems to be walking on stilts. And his fingernails are those of a Chinese mandarin. Not to mention that nose, which alone signals an organism desperately in need of attention from St. Michael the Archangel.I don't want to go through the entire plot. It differs from the classic Bela Lugosi version in a few ways. There is no business with mirrors, garlic, crucifixes, Mogen Davids, bats, St. Christopher medals, silver bullets, or stakes through the heart. Renfield's part is, as I say, largely irrelevant, and the Count's second victim, the pure Lucy, hardly appears. Neither does Professor Van Helsing.This isn't the spookiest version of the tale, although it gets all sorts of kudos for originality. The most frightening version is probably the one with Frank Langella as the count. (I get the titles all mixed up.) It's the most nearly believable because we can imagine the smooth, handsome Langella bringing women under his spell. Francis Ford Coppola's rendition is hardly more than an exercise in style. The classic, with Bela Lugosi, has the advantage over ""Nosferatu"" of being a talkie. It's replete with lines that are unintentionally hilarious. ""Da spider spinnink his vep faw da unvary fly."" And, ""I never drink -- wine."" There have been numerous parodies too -- ""Love At First Bite.""It was directed by F. W. Murnau and released in 1922, but it wasn't what I expected. Murnau was said to be fond of moving the camera around, sliding it sideways, lifting it. As someone once said of Murnau's directorial style, ""They took away his crane and then/ I thought he'd never smile again."" But this is shot from eye level. Howard Hawks could have done it. There's little stylization in the sets either, not a touch of expressionism. This is light years from ""The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari."" Yet it's enjoyable enough. It's bad when Nosferatu is sucking the blood of the poor folks in Transylvania and it's even worse after he moves to Bremen and people start dying all over the place. We always want to see Nosferatu finally get it in the neck himself, if he had one. And actually he gets smoked in the end. Harker's wife follows the directions for exterminating vampires and allows Nosferatu to suck her blood until he's trapped by the rising sun, at which point he disappears in a puff of smoke like the devil in Faust.Vampires seem to have never died -- at least not in cinematic history. There currently appears to be a fascination with them. Several recent movies have shown them as in conflict over their conditions, reluctant to breed with humans, but still ultimately evil. I've tried to figure this out. They're obviously symbols for some other marginalized group, but which group? Gays? The mentally disordered? Pedophiles? Cigarette smokers? Clearly something that Hollywood isn't ready to handle without spells and mirrors and legerdemain.",Nosferatu
15,Tweekums,Nosferatu – A Symphony of Horror,9,17 September 2017,"This silent classic is more than a little inspired by Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'. Set in 1838 in the (fictional) German city of Wisborg our protagonist, Thomas Hutter, is sent to Transylvania by his employer, estate agent Knock, to inform the mysterious and somewhat sinister Count Orlok that he has found a suitable property for him to purchase. Hutter leaves his wife, Ellen, and heads to Transylvania, here the locals are wary when he mentions Orlok and the coachmen won't take him all the way to the castle. When he gets there he is met by Orlok and is invited to eat; when he cuts his finger on a bread knife the count sucks the wound! He still stays the night and in the morning discovers two bite marks on his neck; he suspects mosquitoes. With the purchase complete Orlok travels by ship to Wisborg along with several coffins full of dirt. Wherever Orlok goes there are deaths, which is blamed on the plague due to the presents of rats. Hutter manages to flee the castle but is injured; by the time he has recuperated and returned home Orlok is already there, Knock is insane, the locals believe there is a plague outbreak and Orlok appears to be attracted to Ellen.This is an important early film that is pretty close to the Dracula story so close that we are lucky it survives as Stoker's widow sued and all copies were meant to be destroyed! The story is well told even though there isn't a lot of dialogue. Any important information is given to us on intertitles. The cast do a fine job, most notable is Max Schreck as Orlok; helped by some impressive prosthetics he gives us an impressively creepy vampire, or Nosferatu. It makes a change from the more modern vampires who are typically suave and handsome. The effects are surprisingly good for a film that will soon be a hundred years old and while it didn't manage to frighten me I thought the atmosphere was great. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the vampire genre, classic horror and those interested in early cinema; not as an interesting curiosity but because it is genuinely worth watching.",Nosferatu
16,ma-cortes,Silent classic with the unforgettable rodent face Max Schrenk as the most horrifying of all screen vampires,8,16 October 2011,"This expressionist German milestone called Nosferatu-Eine Symphonie Des Grauens -Nosferatu a Symphony of Horror- turns out to be a hit in the history of world cinema and especially in terror cinema . It deals with newlyweds named Jonathan and Lucy Harker who are saddened when Harker is sent to Transylvania by employer Renfield to arrange for Count Dracula's purchase of a house across the street from the Harkers' house. Harker travels to Transylvania where he stays with the Count , is sucked by the Count, and eventually escapes from the castle. Jonathan returns to Lucy but spends all his time sitting on a chair in the living room. Nosferatu moves into the house across from the Harkers' and goes to Bremen in a ship called Demeter . The rise in deaths is accredited to a plague thought to have arrived with the Demeter. Only a woman can break his frightfull spell , a woman pure in heart who offer her blood freely to Nosferatu and will keep the vampire by his side until the cook crowed . As the vampire meets his doom when Lucy manages to keep him until after cockcrow.This German all time classic silent horror-movie from 1922 is a captivating and eerie experience with creepy images , imaginative sets and exciting touches . Max Schreck is perfect as Nosferatu with his rat face, long nails , pointed ears and skeletal frame . The story brilliantly conveys the loneliness , despair sadness of the characters .The landscape is moody and lovely and the sets are gorgeous as well as creepy , especially the phantom castle of The Count , the ship and Bremen town . The slow, somewhat exaggerated reactions of his characters brilliantly echo the performances given by the silent actors . One day, the great Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau was talking with Max Reinhardt. Reinhardt introduced Schreck to Murnau. Murnau saw talent in Schreck and hired him to play Graf (Count) Orlok in the fledgling Prana Film's first production, ""Nosferatu; Eine Symphonie Des Grauens"" -Nosferatu; A Symphony Of Horror- .The regards to Max Schreck are a mystery, he made a few pictures and we don't know anything about his life. His performance as the bald, bat-eared, close fanged Orlok remains one of the most frightening film characters in history . This brilliantly eerie motion picture is originally and compellingly directed by F.W. Murnau .This vampire masterpiece is remade in 1979 titled ¨Nosferatu the Vampyre¨ by Werner Herzog with Klaus Kinski ,Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjnani in which Count Dracula is the victim , he does not enjoy his immortality and wants only to live, love and die like a human ,this version of Nosferatu, in places almost a frame for frame remake , it results to be an enjoyable homage . Followed by ¨Nosferatu in Venice¨ by Augusto Caminito and Mario Caiano with Christopher Plummer , Donald Pleasence and also with Klaus Kinski . Furthermore ¨Shadow of the Vampire¨ with Willem Defoe and John Malkovich ; it is a film about the making and production of Nosferatu ; it had to deal with a lot of strange things ,some crew members disappeared, some died, this movie focuses on the difficult relationship between Murnau, the director, and Schreck, the lead actor.",Nosferatu
17,BA_Harrison,Iconic? Yes. Influential? Undoubtedly. Entertaining? Hmmmm.,5,6 February 2013,"Nosferatu is a must-see for any serious vampire film fan, being the first cinematic realisation of Bram Stoker's infamous Count Dracula (albeit a completely unofficial and not entirely faithful version of Stoker's novel that changes the vampire's name to Count Orlok). That said, although Nosferatu's importance in horror movie history is incontrovertible, the film's outmoded expressionist performances and rather uneven pace mean that its worth as a piece of pure entertainment cannot be so easily determined.Max Schreck's creepy turn as the cadaverous, rat-like Count Orlok is amazingly effective and his character provides the film with its most iconic imagery: Orlok rising stiffly from his coffin as though hinged at the feet, and his distorted shadow creeping up a flight of stairs. Sadly Schreck's on-screen time only amounts to approximately nine minutes, and when the pointy-toothed one isn't around, the film becomes a far more leaden affair cursed with a dreadful central performance from Gustav von Wangenheim as buffoonish Jonathan Harker substitute Hutter.",Nosferatu
18,Quinoa1984,a truly original Vampire film- a tale of the Gothic legend in Murnau's masterpiece,10,25 April 2000,"Nosferatu is a great horror movie (possibly the first ever according to some accounts), and one of the pinnacles of the German silent era of film-making. Made in the silent age by the German expressionist/auteur FW Murnau, the film has the genuine power to act creepy, odd, alluring, mythic, and beautiful by way of images and music that don't leave your mind once the film is over. It's like someone collected a stash of nightmares and pulled them together with the original Bram Stoker story of Dracula. Max Shreck, in his most notorious role (and apparently the only one really anyone's bothered to see) plays the monstrous Count Orlock, a vampire who comes out at night to tempt the living and, of course, to suck blood. Though this story of Dracula has been numerously repeated (even by the Hollywood version in the early 30s), this film is one of the prime examples of how horror SHOULD be done- dispense with cheap thrills or overloading with exposition. A director like Murnau here, who had total artistic control (abeit the film not in circulation for many years), could transform Orlock's world into one of acute, deliberate angles, long deep shadows, and painting with light like some mad artist from the dark ages. One could almost claim that this, alongside Night of the Living Dead, changed the way audiences looked at horror films, that a style and presence could be wrung from characters that bring out the worst fears and dread in common people. Years from now, long into the digital age, there may still be room for of all things a silent, non-talking effort like Nosferatu, where the terror can still be felt through the black and white (sometimes tinted) photography and stark physical performances by Schrek and the others. In short, a film like this is one of the reasons I love to watch horror movies.",Nosferatu
19,wes-connors,F.W. Murnau Creates a Monster,9,26 April 2009,"F.W. Murnau's rendition of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" features what may be the creepiest looking vampire ever committed to film, played by a horrifyingly made-up Max Schreck. Alas, Mr. Schreck isn't shown doing many vampire deeds; mainly, he just looks menacing - and ugly. The horror herein is much more suggested than visible on screen, save for the film's rather more pointed ending. Director Murnau, designer Albin Grau, and photographer Fritz Arno Wagner create beautiful light and dark shadows. The actual lead actor, Gustav von Wangenheim, makes an excellent impression. The sets and locales are magical.********* Nosferatu (3/4/22) F.W. Murnau ~ Gustav von Wangenheim, Max Schreck, Greta Schröder, Alexander Granach",Nosferatu
20,Coventry,"""Is that your wife? What a lovely throat!""",7,18 March 2005,"As I'm sure it is the case for many cinema fans, my respect and admiration towards this production widely excels the enjoyment I had while watching it. ""Nosferatu"" is a milestone from every possible viewpoint and it's one of those very few movies I think everybody should view at least once (although it actually requires repeated viewings) It is the very first version of Bram Stoker's legendary vampire tale and easily the most copied film in the history of cinema. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story of young estate agent Jonathan Harker traveling to Transylvania where he acquaintances the eccentric count who feeds on blood and controls the ones he has bitten, but THIS is the original version. Shot by F.W. Murnau (who also made the equally essential titles ""Faust"" and ""Der Januskopf"") and made unforgettable by Max Schreck in his performance as the Count. And, even though this film is over 80 years old, Schreck's image is still as nightmarish as it can be. No visual or make-up effect could ever surpass the simple appearance of Max Schreck! The fact that this film is still very powerful therefore almost entirely depends on his unworldly character. ""Nosferatu"" is beautiful poetry, difficult to watch at times, but very rewarding. The sexual undertones as well as the shock-aspects have surely dated by now, but they're still present, and  as I mentioned before  they only increase my respect for Murnau and his crew. A definite must see, just make sure you're in the right mood.",Nosferatu
21,michaelRokeefe,Dracula masterpiece of the silent screen.,8,15 October 2001,"F.W. Murnau directs this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. NOSFERATU is arguably the earliest surviving screen version depicting the 'Prince of Darkness'. This German production deviates slightly from the original, but the now familiar story we all know by heart is intact. Count Dracula becomes Count Orlok and journeys to Bremen, Germany instead of London. His physical appearance is not dashing, mesmerizing or even mystical; but much resembles the rats that frequently accompany him. I find this the most eerie of all that would follow. The accompanying organ music background makes this scratchy black and white silent film an essential masterpiece. Max Schreck is immortal as Nosferatu/Count Orlok.",Nosferatu
22,sunwarrior13,The Most Effective Version Of Dracula,10,26 October 2012,"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror, is a classic German Expressionist horror film, directed by F. W. Murnau.It features Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok together with Gustav von Wangenheim,Greta Schröder, Alexander Granach,Ruth Landshoff and Wolfgang Heinz. It was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, with names and other details changed because the studio could not obtain the rights to the novel as for instance, ""vampire"" became ""Nosferatu"" and ""Count Dracula"" became ""Count Orlok"".The film begins in the Carpathian mountains, where real estate agent Hutter has arrived to close a sale with the reclusive Herr Orlok. Despite the feverish warnings of the local peasants, Hutter insists upon completing his journey to Orlok's sinister castle. While enjoying his host's hospitality, Hutter accidentally cuts his finger-whereupon Orlok tips his hand by staring intently at the bloody digit, licking his lips. Hutter catches on that Orlok is no ordinary mortal when he witnesses the vampire nobleman loading himself into a coffin in preparation for his journey to Bremen. By the time the ship bearing Orlok arrives at its destination, the captain and crew have all been killed-and partially devoured. There follows a wave of mysterious deaths in Bremen, which the local authorities attribute to a plague of some sort. But Ellen, Hutter's wife, knows better. Armed with the knowledge that a vampire will perish upon exposure to the rays of the sun, Ellen offers herself to Orlok, deliberately keeping him ""entertained"" until sunrise. At the cost of her own life, Ellen ends Orlok's reign of terror once and for all. One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, Gothic feel and a chilling performance from Max Shrek as the vampire set the template for the horror films that followed for many years to come.Murnau proved his directorial talent in this picture he's a master artisan demonstrating not only a knowledge of the subtler side of directing but in photography.It doesn't scare us anymore for present viewers but it haunts us. It shows not that vampires can jump out of shadows, but that evil can grow there, nourished on death.Finally,it is masterpiece of the German silent cinema and easily the most effective version of Dracula on record.",Nosferatu
23,Theo Robertson,Sorry Ange - It's No Masterpiece,6,26 January 2010,"I once had a friend called Ange who many years ago attended a certain university to take a "" visual arts "" course which is a euphemism for film studies . As can be expected at graduate level the course featured the usual suspects of Soviet Montage , Italian Neo-Realism , La Nouvelle Vague and German Expressionism . I won't identify the university but from what I heard it seemed like the worst university in England with one tutor being a former smack addict and another seen out on the club dance floors totally wired on cocaine . The standard was so bad that when the final test came someone in authority messed up so badly that the students had to revolt so they'd actually receive their final degrees . After this the visual arts course was taken off the syllabus and hopefully the tutors found a vocation better suited to their talents like sitting outside train stations pleading for any spare change . Still despite this Ange seemed to enjoy the course especially the German Expressionism part , so much so that she bought NOSFERATU on video . However after then seeing this movie - which is free to view online because it's in the public domain - I'd really hate to watch the films Ange didn't like if this is the best the university could showNOSFERATU has a complicated history . The producers couldn't obtain the rights to Bram Stoker's novel of Dracula so changed the title and character names . How they managed to get away with this I've no idea since a similar analogy would be making a film called LORD OF THE THINGS featuring creatures called "" Bobbits "" and who have to throw a thing in to an ancient volcano or else the forces of evil called "" Dorks "" will conquer Middle World . Hmmm I wonder if anyone would notice the difference between this and a certain book ? In fact the version I saw makes no pretense that it's a wholesale copy of Dracula and uses the character names from the original source novel The problems with the film is that it's never expressionistic or stylised enough . We've all seen clips of it like Max Schreck's Dracula rising from his coffin and his shadow entering the room of Mina but this is atypical from the rest of the film . There's very little surrealism , bizarre set design , nightmare imagery or any anything expressing the sensations the characters may be feeling . In truth it's very conventional with many scenes that are supposedly set in the dead of night being filmed in daylight It's not a bad film and considering it's silent and feature length I never found myself praying for the end credits which speaks well of its pace and rhythm . That said it's a cinematic legend that no doubt features in all university film courses and led to Hollywood making a film called SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE starring Willem Dafoe as Max Shreck so a mainstream audience should rightly expect more from NOSFERATU . Certainly THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI is much more impressive and memorable and I do wonder if Ange should have wisely spent her money on something else",Nosferatu
24,Doylenf,A chilly experience...Max Schreck makes a great vampire...,6,16 March 2009,"I gave this a late night viewing and perhaps being tired made full concentration difficult, but this was not an easy film to evaluate in light of it being a silent film made in Germany in 1922 by Murnau.The overall impression is one of familiarity with the ""Dracula"" theme, the young man being driven by a coach that will only go so far toward its destination before he has to get out and walk. (This has happened in so many horror stories that we can see it all began with stories like ""Dracula"" on which this is based). GUSTAV VON WANGENHEIM is the young man and he overacts with gusto in typical silent film manner. GRETA SCHRODER is his wife, Ellen, who seems to have an unusually strong link to Count Orlock's menacing presence. She's the woman whose portrait he is shown, upon which he makes the film's most famous remark: ""What a lovely throat!"" It's all very impressionistic, with dark shadows particularly menacing when they show Count Orlock's grotesque form (including his long fingernails) as he looks for victims. Some of the plot elements seem a little obscure which may be a fault of the title cards.Very impressive was the musical score from 1997 by James Bernard which had the appropriately eerie effect that caught the mood of the piece with its somber atmosphere.Damp and chilly are the words that come to mind when I think of this film and its overall effect. I can certainly see why it has the reputation it has as a classic horror film with allowances being made for the style of acting that was anything but subtle by today's standards. Worth a look, but not a film I'm likely to view again.",Nosferatu
25,preppy-3,One of the best vampire films ever made,10,8 October 2016,"A (very) loose adaptation of Dracula. Vampire Count Orlok (Max Schreck) wants to leave Transylvania and go to Germany.

He goes to Germany and ends up bringing the plague with him. Ellen can defeat and kill him but it will mean sacrificing herself.Classic silent horror. Schreck has got to be one of the ugliest vampires in screen history. Fangs, claws and bulging eyes. He's only in the film 9 minutes but you don't forget him. There are many VERY eerie sequences--especially the ship ride to Germany. It's beautifully directed by F.W. Muranu and moves quickly.

27,CinemaSerf,The ultimate vampire film.,7,28 August 2020,"If you were ever to be able to commit your imagination to film when you read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" then I expect you would struggle to come up with anything more vivid than this. What is most striking is the wonderful detail as poor old estate agent ""Hutter"" is despatched to the home of ""Count Orlok"" (Max Schreck) to negotiate the acquisition of an isolated house for him. Once he arrives at the castle, we are subsumed in the eeriness and wickedness as it becomes clear that ""Orlok"" is an epitome of evil. Our story follows the travels of the ""Count"" from his castle to his new home - wreaking plague and havoc as he goes - until he arrives in the town inhabited by ""Ellen"" (a superbly vulnerable yet strong Greta Schröder) - the wife of the estate agent who is hot on their heals. ""Ellen"" has an inkling as to how to kill their nemesis, but that would involve the ultimate sacrifice. Now I have a few slight niggles with it - the inter-titles in a gothic script are, frequently, very difficult to read and that does interrupt the narrative; the editing is just a little too brutal at times and I found the score oppressive - even on the more joyous, or optimistic, scenes it seemed just a bit too overpowering than is necessary, but these are trifles when compared to the beautiful photography. Schreck is magnificent in the title role, exuding menace and malevolence, Gustav von Wangenheim (""Hutter"") conveys the sense of desperation and terror in a truly evocative manner and it all adds up to a taut horror film the likes of which you'll never see in any subsequent treatment of this story.",Nosferatu
28,utgard14,"""Here begins the land of phantoms...""",9,7 November 2014,"Highly influential silent horror classic. It follows the basic story of Dracula. As pretty much everybody knows, they did this adaptation of Stoker's novel without permission. His widow sued and won. The court ordered that every print of this film be destroyed. Thankfully for us, somebody saved a copy. That this film was made nearly a century ago is astonishing. The makeup for the ratlike Count Orlock, played by Max Schreck, is amazing even by modern standards. Orlock still stands to this day as the most uniquely frightening vampire ever put on film. Director F.W. Murnau creates an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere. He uses many authentic ""Old World"" locations that are very spooky. There are lots of creepy and scary moments in Nosferatu. As much as I love the Universal and Hammer Draculas for their entertainment value, I think this is the scariest of all the different versions I've seen. It's best seen at night, as most great horror films are.",Nosferatu
29,lastliberal,Blood! Your precious blood!,8,5 June 2008,"F.W. Murnau's Dracula is just about the most horrifying creature you could experience. Max Schreck presents himself a a thin zombie-like creature with a long face and long bony hands; nothing like the Draculas that many are familiar with, dressed as if they are going to the opera. This is a chilling Dracula; one that would strike fear into anyone that laid eyes upon it. His castle is also different in that it is a crumbling structure along a rocky weedy path, not the lush forests we have come to expect.Murnau uses his settings, shadow and lighting to great effect to present a chilling tale or horror. His characters show real emotions, especially the naive Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) and his lovely wife Ellen (Greta Schröder).The rats throughout were most appropriate as Schrenk also looked like a rat and this film was made at the time of the Black Death in Germany.The ending is very Christian with a sacrifice for all.",Nosferatu
30,zardoz-13,A Classic Silent Horror Vampire Epic!,10,4 October 2009,"F.W. Murnau's silent 1922 chiller ""Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror"" ranks as the earliest vampire epic. As many as twenty vampire movies, some of them short films, had been produced before the release of Murnau's landmark epic. Unfortunately, none of these earlier vampire films survived. Ostensibly, ""Golem"" scenarist Henrik Galeen and Murnau appropriated Bram Stoker's celebrated 1897 novel ""Dracula"" as the basis for their plot, but they neglected to obtain copyright clearance from Stoker estate. Inevitably, Stoker's widow Florence sued Murnau and the company, won the case in court, and demanded that the authorities confiscate and destroy every print and negative of ""Nosferatu."" Happily, ""Nosferatu"" survived this court order, and audiences can enjoy it today. Not only does ""Nosferatu"" qualify as the first ""Dracula"" adaptation, but it also is a touchstone picture in the vampire genre because its vampire, Court Orlok, appeared emaciated and ugly. He looked nothing like either Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee embodied. Max Schreck portrayed Court Orlok as a hideously ugly vampire. He sports needle type fangs in the front of his mouth, and he looks like a concentration camp inmate.""Nosferatu"" isn't a slavish adaptation of ""Dracula."" Apparently, Galeen and Murnau tried to skirt the copyright issue by altering the setting, changing several names, and marginalizing certain characters. Nevertheless, despite these revisions, the court ruled in favor of Florence Stoker. Basically, the plot remains intact. One major departure involves Professor Van Helsing. Usually, Van Helsing acts as Dracula's arch enemy. Galeen and Murnau have reduced his role here to providing exposition about parasitic vampire organisms. Furthermore, the Murnau film takes place in Germany in 1838 whereas the Stoker novel occurred in the 1890s. Interestingly, unlike Dracula, Orlok does not create other vampires with his bite. He kills them as the plague serves as a metaphor of his evil. One precedent that ""Nosferatu"" established was that vampires were susceptible to sunlight. Meaning, they could be killed by the sun, something that wasn't the case with Stoker's literary protagonist who would stroll around during the day, though his powers were considerably attenuated. Meanwhile, enough similarities existed to seal the fate of the filmmakers. In Bremen, Germany, a strange real estate agent named Knock dispatches Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim), to travel to distant Transylvania in the Carpathian Mountains to transact a business deal with the Count. In Stoker's novel, the Hutter character was named Jonathan. Anyway, Thomas is a rather adolescent, happy-go-luck character. He dismisses the warnings of the local folk as superstitious nonsense. He discovers a book, The Book of the Vampires, left in his room and casts it aside in contempt. Presumably, the local equivalent of the Gideons put this book in every wayfarer's room as a sort of admonition. An eerie moment occurs when the coachmen takes Hutter to a bridge and leave him afoot because he refuses to cross over into the province of phantoms. Later, a sinister coach drawn by horses decked out in hoods arrives with a creepy looking driver. Hutter climbs aboard for a whirlwind ride to the foreboding castle where the nobleman awaits him. The Count (Max Schreck) wants to pull up stakes in ""Nosferatu"" and relocate in Bremen. Indeed, the two eponymous vampires forsake their homeland and embark on a voyage to another city.Before the Count departs, he attacks Hutter and leaves him for dead. Meanwhile, the Count loads six coffins onto a wagon, clambers into the topmost coffin, levitates the lid onto it and sets the horses in motion for the harbor. This ""Dracula"" is very supernaturally endowed. Moreover, not only can Count Orlok control things nearby, but he can also control things at a great distance and has acquired power over Hutter's employer Knock. Eventually, Knock goes insane and he is put in a strait-jacket and placed in a psychiatric asylum. In the Stoker novel, the character of Knock was named Renfield.During the voyage, both Dracula and Orlok assume command of their vessels. In ""Nosferatu,"" the outbreak of the plague is associated with the rats that infest Orlok's coffins. Everybody dies on the respective ships. The Count arrives in the ship at Wisborg with nobody left alive, but the ship is teeming with rats carrying a plague that wrecks havoc. German officials examine the ship, read the captain's log and fear the worst: plague. Before long, panic grips the public about the plague and people start to die. The scenes where town officials mark front doors looks almost Biblical. Meanwhile, Hutter escapes from Orlok's castle and nearby peasants nurse him back to health. By now, Orlok has killed everybody on the ship. Orlok is entranced by Hutter's girl and he takes a dilapidated building across the street from Hutter's house. While all of this is going on, Ellen has developed a psychic connection with Nosferatu. She will exert her power, but in the process she will die as she lures the undead villain to dally in her room until the morning rays of sunlight penetrate his body and he disappears.Although many critics tried to pigeonhole Murnau in with the German Expressionist movement, he was not entirely given over to expressionism. For instance, Expressionists prefer to shoot inside the orderly confines of a studio, whereas Murnau took his cameras onto location to shoot some scenic footage for the film. Watch closely and you will see that Schreck rarely blinks. ""Nosferatu"" emerges as one of the greatest horror films, and Schreck's performance as the ""Dracula"" vampire is without parallel.",Nosferatu

One of the most atmospheric movies I have ever seen.The story is told in a great way and I must say that it's told better than any other Dracula movie later released. The movie is full with some classic horror scene's that later would inspire many other filmmakers.And yes the movie is actually scary, which is mainly thanks to Max Schreck who plays the part of Count Orlok in a most incredible way, also helped by some good make up. Most of the other performances are typically early movie stuff. Meaning that it's silly over the top at times. Gustav von Wangenheim gives a great lesson in overacting and his laugh might very well be the weirdest I have ever seen in a movie. But in a way all those performances give the movie a certain charm which makes it irresistible to watch.There are also some surprising good special effects. Better one's as in the 1931 version with Bela Lugosi anyway. Some of them were really impressive and I can imaging it really seriously freaked some people out back in 1922.Truly a piece of movie history that needs to been seen by the movie lovers, especially by those who like the horror genre.

Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count a house, but he also notices and feels strange occurrences. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes he is really a vampire....There have been many different incarnations of the Dracula character. Some very faithful, The Hammer version, Coppollas epic, the Frank Langella one, and of course Lugosi, all stand out as very impressive retellings of the story. But for all their impressive tricks and twists on the yarns, none of them are scary.So its ironic then that the version that had the Stoker clan up in arms, is the most haunting, and visually terrifying version you may ever see.Yes, the acting, especially Hutter leaves a lot to be desired, but Murnaus eye is wonderful, and Schreck is still the most freakish version of the count. Even though his screen time is little over nine minutes, he makes a real impact.If you prefer your vampires ala Jackmans Van Helsing, or Dracula 2000, stay away, you won't like it.An amazing feat, and watch Shadow Of The Vampire straight after, just to make it that little more freaky.",Nosferatu
35,The_Void,The finest classic version of the Dracula story,9,14 October 2005,"F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu is Dracula in all but name. The story surrounding to the rights to film Bram Stoker's classic novel is well known, so I wont repeat it; but all I can say is thank god that not every copy was burned! Nosferatu is easily the best of the classic cinematic Dracula's and is, of course, a huge success for both silent cinema and the horror genre in it's own right. F.W. Murnau is one of the greatest directors of the silent era, and although he would go on to better this film with both Faust and Sunrise years afterwards, Nosferatu still stands out as one of the man's huge successes. It's his direction that makes the film what it is a lot of the time, as he expertly captures each sequence and makes the film frightening, mysterious and even funny in all the right places. The plot follows the classic Dracula story (albeit with names changed), and we see Hutter, an estate agent, travel to Count Orlok's castle in order to sell him a property in London. After buying the property, Orlok travels to London where he tries to take Hutter's lovely wife Ellen for himself.Max Schreck's performance as the vampire, Count Orlok, is so amazingly convincing that it has had a film made in tribute to it! 2000's Shadow of the Vampire works from the idea that Schreck really was a vampire, and judging by his performance in this film - that might even have been true! Silent acting is hard to rate, but good performances always shine through and a good performance is definitely what Murnau got out of Schreck. Seeing him on screen here, it's hard to imagine that he was ever anything else in real life. And there aren't many performances throughout cinema history that one can say that for! The atmosphere is very well done, and Murnau ensures it is always macabre and I can imagine that this film would have scared a few people upon its German release in 1922. This film would go on to be remade in 1979 by the talented team of Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski, and while their version was very good - Murnau's version will always be better, and although it has obviously dated a lot; Nosferatu will always be seen as one of the true classics of the horror genre. This is one of those films that every film fan must see - so if you haven't already, don't wait too long!",Nosferatu
36,zetes,Pretty Good,9,1 February 2001,"Nosferatu is a pretty good silent film, but I don't think it has aged as well as other silent films. Some of the cinematic techniques haven't aged well - I'm particularly thinking of the scene where Nosferatu stocks his wagon, getting ready to leave. The film is speeded up, a technique which is associated more with silent comedies, especially of the Keystone variety, so it made me laugh. I also laughed at the line: ""Your wife has a beautiful throat."" However, Max Schreck has to be the best vampire I've ever seen. I saw this film about five months ago in preparation to see Shadow of the Vampire, which I had heard about when it was at Cannes. So, although I don't think it has aged well, Nosferatu is certainly worth watching, if only for Schreck, who more or less steals the entire film anyway.",Nosferatu
37,Sylviastel,Early Silent Classic!,7,9 July 2012,"The film is fine but it's dated and silent even without music to help move the film along. The actors and actresses did a fine job without a script. The film isn't as frightening today as it might have been in it's time period in 1922. The story unfolds slowly and carefully about the legend of vampires in Transylvania. There is a twist at the end of the story. The Nosferatu is the vampire whose legend unfolds in this film. This film is dark in black and white and appropriately too. The length is only about an hour and that's fine. It's interesting to see how audiences would have reacted to it's initial release. The story of a man who sells a house in Bremen, Germany in Pre-World War II time to the mysterious Count is chilling at times. It's sometimes better to see without speaking in the silent film genre.

38,trashgang,a must see for all horror buffs,10,7 January 2014,"I have seen this one a few times but now that it is out on Blu Ray it is finally out full uncut. Don't get me wrong. The full uncut doesn't mean that gore was left out in other versions because there isn't any which is normal for a flick from that era but the flick had a few problems when it was released in 1922.But first before watching this cult classic you have to know something about F. W. Murnau, the director. He was chosen because he had an occult background. The producer Albin Grau was an occultist and both added some occult to spot throughout this flick. Just watch the symbols on the papers which were filled with Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Or the use of shadows to be believed that they brought you to another dimension. In fact, they made a company alive Prana to bring out this rip-off of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Although the critics adored this flick it became a big failure at the box office and resulted in bankruptcy. The reason was that no money came in but that the wife of Stoker sued Prana for using the script of Dracula as base of Nosferatu. It resulted in the fact that all copies had to be destroyed in which they did but luckily for us, some copies were already out of Germany in private hands but not all in good shape. So different version popped up after years until a few years ago when they discovered scene's on a French film. They restored the flick in full glory with the original soundtrack and German intertitles, upscaled in 1080p and 5.1 score and I must say, it looks great.The flick itself is a bit slow in some parts but is still worth watching to see the effects used. Back then it wasn't that easy to do editing effects but they did and it works out fine. Just watch Nosferatu coming out of his grave. It still looks eery. It's not only the atmosphere that makes it a classic but also the performance by Max Schreck. Rumours wer all around that in real life Max was a vampire. A classic and a must see for all horror buffs.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Nosferatu
39,christopher-underwood,Wonderful to be able to watch this in such clarity,8,20 October 2020,"Wonderful to be able to watch this in such clarity almost 100 years after it was made. So long since I have watched it that I had forgotten how many scenes go on for so long and that there are so many telescopic fades in and out and then there are other scenes over in a flash. So many key sequences, mostly featuring the magnificent Max Schreck, seem to fly by. Iconic moments seem rushed but it is probably that I am so used to seeing these images frozen as illustrations that it comes as a surprise to see the shadowed figure gliding quickly up the stairs and encroaching upon the sleeping figure. Particularly impressed this time also with the outside sequences, some marvellously evocative and well framed shots of countryside and outbuildings and the glorious shots of Schreck's new home across the canal and not forgetting the majestic glide of the ship into harbour. Excellent as ever.",Nosferatu
40,StevePulaski,A work of pure expressionism and eeriness,10,5 July 2012,"I am faced with one of my greatest challenges when reviewing a classic and it doesn't get any easier; trying to say something new about a film most everyone has seen and everyone has already formed an incorruptible opinion on. Oh, what to say. Nosferatu is a perfect horror film in every sense. It transports us back to a simpler time in cinema, when jump scares weren't the main concern, but atmosphere and tonal consistency. Where performances still mattered, and weren't reduced to archetypal characters and stereotypes.Nosferatu was the only production from the company Prana Films in 1921, and despite not having the rights to Bram Stroker's novel, Dracula, ambitious writer Henrik Galeen was given the assignment and pursued the challenge in adapting his story to film. With legendary director F.W. Murnau behind the camera, as well, the project was shaping out to be a fascinating and unique look on the vampire himself. It was shaping out to be perfect, until Stoker's widow, Florence Stoker, denied the rights to her deceased husband's work for unknown reasons. With a few minor changes, Murnau pushed on and made the film, but when Stoker sued, initially, the punishment was to have every copy of the film destroyed. While that clearly wasn't enforced to the fullest degree, it is unknown if the version available today is the original cut. Some reports have the film running at a runtime ten to fifteen minutes longer than the cut commercially available today, however, no official evidence has proved that the cut we possess today is censored or not.There's almost no reason to reiterate the story of the film seeing as it's pretty much the story of Dracula, which almost everybody knows. The American cut of the film even refers to Count Orlok as ""Count Dracula,"" so the secrecy is corrupt. Let's focus on the film itself. First off, one can not deny that this is one of the finest horror films ever made. The technicalities behind the film are primitive, raw, and undeniably authentic. It was shot with only one camera, incorporates some very unstable editing, utilizes grainy film stock, and as a whole, is crafted extremely simplistically. This is not criticism, but observationist recollections of the picture as a whole. I'd personally much rather have all of those things than very glossy, pitch-perfect horror production. The primitive nature of the film is a breath of fresh air in a world where everything has to be so painstakingly perfect all the time.Nosferatu, himself, is played by Max Schreck, in arguably one of the greatest roles ever in a horror film. Schreck's character is tall, lanky, with large, bulging, unblinking eyes, equipped with a large, boxy nose, an unmoved expression always on his face, and stiff and unmovable torso. His first appearance on screen is jolting and brings a shiver to even the most experienced horror moviegoer. Schreck immerses himself into this role, making his vampire character not a character aware of implausibility but one, by the end, you believe could actually be real.I mentioned the use of film noir, as well. This is a recurring aspect for the film itself, mainly because it is so frequently and professionally used. The iconic ""stair scene"" where you see Nosferatu eerily walk up the stairs in shadow is a work of Gothic genius, and has become a staple of film noir in the horror genre. Not to mention, so has the delightfully creepy scene of Nosferatu ominously rising from his coffin and staring directly at the viewer. It is film technique like that that is truly invaluable.Starring: Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schröder, Alexander Granach, Ruth Landshoff, and Wolfgang Heinz. Directed by: F.W. Murnau.",Nosferatu

We've of course remember them, but how many of us have really seen one? I happen to love them though, my film appreciation class made me run out and get as many silent films as possible, one of the most memorable silent films of all time is Nosferatu. A film that still to this day remains one of the most harrowing movies of all time. Say what you will about how far special effects have come into today's movies, but the silent film really made this movie into the true horror story that has memorable images and still gives me nightmares.Thomas Hutter is an employee at a real estate firm in a city called Wisborg, living with Ellen, his wife. His employer, Knock, receives a mysterious letter. Knock decides to send him to visit Count Orlok in the Carpathian Mountains to finalize the sale of a house. Hutter leaves his wife with his good friend Harding, and Harding's sister Ruth, before embarking on his multiple-month journey. He goes on the trip and he is soon picked up by Count Orlok's coach, which is driven by a strange specter that hides its face, and moves at an unnatural speed. At his arrival at the castle, whose doors open by themselves, he is welcomed by Count Orlok. His grotesque facial features hidden at this stage by his hat, Orlok initially appears to be a mere eccentric gentleman. Hutter has dinner at the castle; Orlok refuses to eat and silently reads a letter. A bell rings at midnight and a startled Hutter cuts his thumb. Count Orlok tries to suck the blood out of the wound, but stops at Hutter's horror, who then falls asleep in the parlor after a conversation with Orlok. Hutter wakes up to an empty castle with fresh wounds on his neck, he's oh so doomed at this point.The very first vampire movie of all time, when F.W. Murnau couldn't get the rights to Dracula, he created actually one of the most memorable horror movies of all time. Seriously, if you have never seen this movie, try to find it, and if you dare say that the image of Orlok waking up and rising out of his coffin doesn't scare the ever loving daylight out of you, I'm going to go all Clockwork Orange on you, tape you to a chair put toothpicks in your eye lids to keep them open and you're going to watch this in the dark. This movie is a true classic and will always remain one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.10/10",Nosferatu
42,Red-Barracuda,A classic of the silent era,7,1 June 2009,"If Dracula (1931) can be seen as the Anglo-American version of Bram Stoker's novel, then Nosferatu has to be the screen version of that novel seen through a European perspective. This product of German Expressionism was, like the earlier Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, highly stylized. It's a film that relies hugely on imagery. And what indelible visuals it presents. It's use of shadows and light is rightfully famous and was a huge influence on horror and film-noir movies of subsequent generations.Perhaps the oldest film in existence that truly has the power to disturb. Granted it's not exactly going to terrify modern audiences but there is something disturbing about those images of the Nosferatu; made,if anything, even more disconcerting by the aged film. Compare Max Schreck's Count Orlok to Bela Lugosi's Dracula and I defy anyone to say that the former is not more sinister. Schreck gives a truly subhuman performance. His Nosferatu is a far cry from the cultured aristocrat of future presentations of the Count. He is a devil in the devil's clothing. An irredeemably evil rat-like being. It's one of the most iconic performances from the silent age.While I actually prefer to watch Werner Herzog's remake, I recognize the excellence of this very old movie. It's one of the greatest achievements of silent cinema and is a must for any student of the horror genre.",Nosferatu

It's too ""cutesy"" sounding for my taste - and that ruins the atmosphere that is created within an otherwise good movie.All in all this is a pretty good movie to watch and Max Schreck is one of the creepiest vampires to ever graze the screen.

45,sddavis63,It's Technically Brilliant But Something Just Wasn't Right,6,26 June 2011,"There's no doubt that this is a technically brilliant movie - groundbreaking considering that it was made in 1922. It's well filmed and features generally pretty good performances from its cast all around, within the parameters you would expect for the style of acting used in silent films of the era. It also gives us the German actor Max Schreck as Count Orlok - who may be the creepiest, most monstrous and most frightening take on the Dracula character ever - far more than Bela Lugosi (who basically defines the role) could ever hope for. It's even funny in places - I think of the scene where Orlock looks at a picture of Hutter's wife and says ""your wife has a beautiful neck."" It is, of course, a variation on the Dracula story, with the names changed and some significant parts of the story changed to get around the fact that director F.W. Murnau didn't have the rights to the story. But those changes don't detract from the basic story. In fact, they may enhance it by giving this a fresher sense. You don't know exactly what's going to happen because there are some differences. It has a lot going for it no doubt.But something's not right. Maybe - as good as Schreck was (and even perhaps superior to Lugosi) - Lugosi's take on the character has so entranced all subsequent adaptations of the story that this just doesn't seem like the story. I found it very difficult to enter into this. It's not a problem with silent movies. I've enjoyed a number of silent movies over the years. But as well made as this was, this just didn't draw me in. I had to sit with it a number of times before I could sit through the whole thing - and at 1:20 it's not very long. And yet, to be honest, there's not any particular problem I can put my finger on. For all the good things involved with this production, something just wasn't working for me. It's unsatisfying to me that I can't explain what the problem was. It's just that there was a problem somewhere. Still, a movie as well made as this that was made when it was can't get anything less than 6/10.",Nosferatu

48,ElMaruecan82,The Seminal Horror Movie (and Cult Classic)...,8,11 September 2017,"It is hard to believe that Stam Broker's successors obtained from a court the right to destroy all the copies of ""Nosferatu"". Seriously, can you imagine the loss it would have been? Tragic indeed... if it wasn't for a fistful of fans from the earliest hour who understood the value of this work or understood the value of any artistic work for that matter. Wikipedia mentions it as one of the earliest instances of a cult-movie and the existence of so many versions (I found three different ones) say a lot about the many hands that handled the reel as if it ceased to belong to its own creator F.W. Murnau and became a staple of fetishist cinematic value. But even a film that would have been one tenth what ""Nosferatu"" was would have deserved to be kept. Well, ""Nosferatu"" is still the masterpiece of horror movies, the seminal horror film and one of the early precursors of German expressionism. Academically speaking, the title is as unavoidable in a discussion about groundbreaking movies as Chaplin or Keaton when you talk of early slapstick comedies. And the film's curse was its greatest blessing, by being forced to change the name of Count Dracula to Count Orlok and Vampire to Nosferatu, the film distanced itself from the usual archetypes we associate to vampires and that always suggest some elements of Gothic romanticism rather than sheer horror. Max Schrek's Nosferatu isn't the suave, well-spoken Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee, he's a monster with the teeth of rodent, a robotic walk and hands so long and sharp you feel like the shadows can touch you. Dracula is a pop culture phenomenon like Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"", ""Nosferatu"" is another deal.And the performance of Max Schreck can cover countless chapters. This is less a performance than a presence, whenever he occupies the screen, Nosferatu seems to be in a frozen state, a sort of hypnotic trance, like a still image leaving us enough time to contemplate our own fear rather than rooting for someone's terror. Jump scares are effective but establishing mood and atmospheres that suggest terror is a more challenging exercise. Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" had two or three jump scares but the film is mostly remembered for these long moments before the big bite. Murnau, before any other director, understood the value of anticipation and created a good balance between quiet and scary moments, which makes the quiet moment never totally devoid from some tense apprehension. ""Nosferatu"" is a nerve-racking experience in that sense and the quality of image (I'd recommend the colorized version) adds to the creepinessNow, of course, one can't totally neglect the aspects that aged a little, Max Schreck's performance carries the film but you can't say the same about the other actors. What's more there's a tendency for the film to drag on a little, to cover a few unnecessary moments that dilute the terror rather than maintaining on its high level, but never do these element ruin the believability and the heart-pounding consistency of the story. For one thing it might be because the story is set in the 19th century and the 1922 dating makes the film closer in time to the era it portrays than ours. No modern device could have changed the setting so there's a sort of raw feeling accentuated by the blurry images and the dark shadows. By being as old as its story, the film creates an eerie documentary-like feeling. And when you know that Schreck somewhat believed to have the Nosferatu persona, you start wondering whether you'd have spend the night with him if you could travel in time.I guess it all comes down to that question, we would all love to travel in a time and visit the shooting of some iconic movie, but how would we feel about particular one? The best credit to Schreck's performance and iconic status would be to say ""thanks, but no thanks"". And maybe another credit to his performance is that an actor was nominated for an Oscar by playing him while playing Nosferatu, the actor was Willem Dafoe in ""Shadow of the Vampire"", and while I'm not sure I'd watch ""Nosferatu"" many times, I'm looking forward to discover that one, and Herzog's remake with Klaus Kinski.",Nosferatu
49,Pjtaylor-96-138044,More a historical achievement than an entertaining watch.,5,21 May 2018,"'Nosferatu (1922)' is widely considered the first horror movie. F.W. Murnau's pioneering silent film was truly ahead of its time, with some iconic creepy imagery and themes. The film is starting to show its age now, though. Despite being worth a watch for its historical merit, it doesn't really provide much in the way of entertainment. Still, it is no doubt an achievement. 5/10",Nosferatu
50,dromasca,the grandmother of all horror films,8,17 May 2010,"Each time I see a film like 'Nosferatu' from the silent time period I cannot help reflecting how different the experience of watching movies was in the first three decades of the history of cinema. Even today when the big equalizer of cinema watching which is the home TV screen and the elaborated music that now comes together with almost any silent film should bring the experience closer to watching a contemporary film, the feeling of watching a different type of films, with focus on the image quality and actors expressive skills almost derives in the feeling that I am watching a different art - one that may even come closer to deserve the numeral seven in the order of classical arts.The 1922 version of 'Nosferatu' is considered as the first horror and vampires film in history, the opener to a series of films inspired by Briam Stoker's 'Dracula' which by now seems endless and covers multiple genres beyond being a genre by itself. Is it a scary movie? Certainly not by the norms of the 21st century viewer. Yet one can find here many of the elements that will be used later not only by the Dracula series and vampire flicks, but also other genres of horror story- embryos of the Rocky Horror show are present in a scene where a science professor explains carnivore plants to his pupils, in other scenes rats and spiders show up in a premonition of their respective sub-genres. The quality of the film resides however in the complex settings, in the stylish costumes and in the camera work which brings to perfection the fixed camera style filling in the screen with shapes, movements, and suggestions. Also remarkable is the quality of the script and the fluidity of the story telling, F.W. Murnau succeeds to create a Gothic story with action plans which run in parallel just to meet at the maximum suspense point, a technique that will be used and brought to perfection later by directors like Hitchcock. And yes, the scenes that take place in Transylvania are quite well made, no big gaffes or historic mix-ups as it too often happens in other more recent 'Dracula' films. There is of course some real or fake ingenuity in the feminine character who sacrifices herself to the vampire for the greater community good, but this part is also in line with the quality naivety of other great silent movies.I have seen on the European ARTE TV channel the digitized version of the film, based on multiple sources from the German and Czech archives. Try to find to see this new version, it is worth the effort, and maybe to some extent closer to the original, although it is paradoxically the most recent.Director Murnau has left a legacy including this film and a few other considered today masterpieces of the German expressionist movie industry. By the the time he died the year was 1931, two or three years in the spoken film era, Murnau had moved to America, but never got to making the great movies of a career in the spoken film art, a career that we shall never know.",Nosferatu
51,gbill-74877,Watch it for the macabre Count Orlok,7,14 May 2016,"Who can forget Max Schreck as the ultra-creepy 'Count Orlok', a classic performance in horror movie history? Director F.W. Murnau gives us a scary, macabre vampire, far from the smooth and suave Draculas in other versions, and uses shadows and shots of Orlok's face to scare the audience throughout the movie. Orlok has elongated arms and claw-like hands, dark eyebrows and glowering eyes with a sinister stare, and is truly spine-tingling.You see in this film so many of the trademark horror elements, such as the villagers in an inn warning young Hutter about the danger as he mentions his plans to go to Orlok's castle, which may remind you of movies like 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London'. And yet, this one deserves credit for being first, in 1922, and for giving us some fantastic scenes, such as the one of Hutter finding and opening his coffin, where we see just a fraction of Orlok's evil face initially, eyes open and long fangs visible. Alexander Granach is also great as 'Knock', his minion/ estate agent with giant, bushy eyebrows, who, when jailed, catches and eats flies for their blood.I don't think it's cool that Murnau changed the names around because he couldn't get movie rights to Bram Stoker's story, but I'm glad the film survived (Stoker's heirs wanted all prints destroyed). The movie drags on at times and the simplicity of the ending was not satisfying to me, so it fell a little short, but if you're into classic horror films, this is probably must-see and you may love it, instead of just liking it as I did.",Nosferatu
52,Cineanalyst,Natural Horror,9,20 November 2017,"The earliest still-existing filmic adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula,"" ""Nosferatu"" continues to be one of the most critically appreciated. As an unauthorized adaptation, this production has an interesting legal history. The case brought by Stoker's widow bankrupted the studio, which, consequently, only ever made this one film. And the draconian judgement ordered the destruction of all its prints—a real-world allegory that's a little too on the nose for a vampire story. Obviously, ""Nosferatu"" wasn't so easily killed, and its artistic and cultural worth is a strong argument against strict copyright laws. Regardless, some of the most interesting aspects of the film are how it reinterprets, or differs from, the book.Whereas the novel is set in the late 19th Century—around the time it was written—and mostly in England, ""Nosferatu"" takes place in 1838 and mostly in the fictional village of Wisborg. It retains the Count's origins from Transylvania, though. Relocating the story has been a common-enough practice, which I think is generally wise for productions not already set in the English-speaking world. Altering the time has also been common, but usually it's to update it. Setting the story decades earlier has turned out to be a strange choice, indeed. Stoker's tale features quite a few technologies and techniques that were new in its era, including railway travel, the phonograph, typewriter, shorthand and blood transfusions—all of which are absent here. (Stoker made no mention of the then-new invention of film, but the 1992 movie does.) Stoker's heroes used these advances to defeat the ancient Dracula. Additionally, syphilis, which was rampant at the time, was a subtextual theme of the tale of sex and blood. ""Nosferatu"" replaces these concerns with an emphasis on nature and the older threat of plague. This has the benefit of including an entire village in the monster menace— something the Universal films did with their other series, including ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Wolf Man,"" but not with ""Dracula."" ""Nosferatu"" even has a mob chase after the Renfield type, ""Knock,"" because they suspect him of vampirism.Also less prominent here is Catholicism; instead of mainstream religion and science, the filmmakers focus more on their own, reported, occultism. Just look at the strange symbols on the letter exchanged between the Count and Knock. Relatedly, one of the more lasting changes from the film has been the myth of vampires dying from sunlight, which is contrary to Stoker.The focus on nature had the benefit of avoiding the construction of expensive sets for the new studio and allows for some nice location shooting. The transitional skyline views showing the passages of day and night take on more meaning than they would otherwise, as do the many scenes of rats. Being reset in the Biedermeier period was surely also a benefit to the production's costs, as that era's utilitarian style demanded less interior-design excess than Stoker's Victorian age. With such drab interiors, exterior shots are naturally the more beautiful, and the film spends much of its time outside, including extended scenes of the Harker character (renamed ""Hutter"") frolicking outdoors in the first acts and, later, racing back home on horseback in lieu of trains.Another aspect of the novel that the filmmakers had to contend with was its epistolary structure, which consists of the story being told through various media, including diaries, letters, newspapers and phonograph records, and by multiple narrators. Instead, ""Nosferatu"" opens as its own book, and the intertitles relate the unfolding tale as described by an unseen narrator based on his secondhand accounts. There's also a book-within-the-book about vampires, which the Harker and Mina (renamed ""Ellen"") types read. This book largely replaces the Van Helsing character, who slightly exists in the film only in the minor role of Professor Bulwer, a Paracelsian (in keeping with the film's overall occult alternatives, Paracelsianism was, apparently, an alternative to traditional medicine and real science). Rather than perform blood transfusions, Bulwer, in one scene, gives a demonstration of how the Venus flytrap and the Hydra species are like vampires and phantoms. Otherwise unrelated to the main story, this scene further places the supernatural within the natural.One other thing I like about this adaptation is that it doesn't reduce the Mina role entirely to damsel in distress, which is what other adaptations do, including both 1931 versions. Stoker's Mina, through her skills as a diarist, stenographer and typist, became the main storyteller, as well as the heroic leader by risking her life in maintaining her psychic connection with Dracula. This film's Ellen, at least, demonstrates superior reading comprehension over her hubby; by following the vampire book's instructions, she sacrifices herself. She and Orlock also have a psychic link, although it's unexplained.Thematically, ""Nosferatu"" is an interesting and unique take on ""Dracula."" Stylistically, it also does some things well. Besides the naturalism, Max Schreck's Count Orlock is a grotesque figure with rodent-like features, which is more faithful to the spirit if not the details of the novel and almost as memorable as Bela Lugosi's suave vamp. The film features many shots through, mostly rounded, archways, and its frequent employment of irises double the circular motif. Orlock's shadows are especially impressive for a 1922 film. The gimmicky effects, such as the fast-motion photography and the negative shot during the carriage scene, aren't bad, either. Perhaps, the weakest part of the film is that most of its shots are static, which stands in stark contrast to later films by its director F.W. Murnau, including ""The Last Laugh"" (1924), ""Tartuffe"" (1925), ""Faust"" (1926) and ""Sunrise"" (1927), all of which make innovative use of the ""unchained"" camera.(Mirror Note: Orlock is seen in the mirror during his climactic death scene. This fits with the film's naturalist theme of a vampire who casts both many shadows and reflections. Also, Hutter fixes his tie in an early mirror shot, which contrasts with him, later, using a mirror to examine bite marks. Ellen, meanwhile, is associated with windows.)",Nosferatu

54,secondtake,"uber Vampire, ultra Dracula, before the glamorizing of the legend!",7,19 January 2011,"Nosferatu (1922)You can't look at a movie as interesting, original, and yet technically dated as ""Nosferatu"" the same way you would a new movie, or a Hollywood classic. Murnau's truly great horror film comes a full decade before the famous ""Dracula"" that copied so much from, and it has to be seen on its own terms, in the thick of the German silent era. Even as a silent film it is five years from the stylish peak of the genre, and so there is a creakiness to some of the techniques (the edits, the iris effects, and so on) that come with the territory.But it's never slow, and in many ways is much more together and sophisticated than Tod Browning's 1931 version, which of course has at least the addition of sound and of Bela Lugosi, the new star, to make it legendary. Here there are a lot of details in scenes not bothered with in later versions, as in the journey on the ship to England, which is one of the most beautiful parts of the movie, or scenes of the countryside which set a place more than a mood.Of course, the two movies are more similar than different, with the basic vampire legend intact--sucking the blood from the necks of beautiful young women, for starters, and needing to avoid sunlight. The expressionist light is wonderful even if it's just showing a swarm of rats. The camera-work is gorgeous, even when static, and when it moves (as on the ship) it's elegant and modern. There is an overuse of the iris vignetting effect for our tastes, no doubt, giving the scenes a constraining feeling rather than a limitlessness that even Browning manages to achieve, and of course Coppola and Herzog do much differently in their recent versions. In fact, see all four. There are others, but these are the famous ones, not including the miserable but campy Warhol vampire film, and the rather different Dreyer 1932 version called ""Vampyr,"" and then some offshoots that are sometimes terrific, but which are not really based on the same story line at all.It's odd to talk about a vampire movie and not mention the main actor, the vampire player, in this case Max Schreck, but in fact he has no meaning for American audiences. The director, F.W. Murnau, is another story, with a stellar brief career including the Hollywood masterpiece, ""Sunrise,"" which won the first best picture Oscar ever.

Some think that, like sushi, it is an acquired taste. Not really. Remember that, in the age of books (those rectangular things made of folded paper), readers had to ""imagine"" BOTH the visuals and the audio. So here we are one step closer to Imax, if you prefer to think of it that way. Anyway, if you have never seen a silent film, this is where you want to start. The strangeness of both the film and the actor (Shreck) have never been duplicated. The movie is unforgettable, a term I cannot readily recall using often in my reviews. So unforgettable that (this is extraordinary) some 80 years later Hollywood did an entire production not as a remake, but rather an alleged narrative based on the filming of the original -- and that film hinted that the reason the actor in the first was so effective was because (wait for it...) he was a real vampire who just lucked into getting the part. Wow.(Another silent film recommendation: the original Zorro, demonstrates what we today call ""athleticism"" to a degree that is extraordinary).",Nosferatu
56,Irishchatter,A very good silent film although its not Dracula!,8,7 January 2017,"Although even though it said it was based on Bram Stokers novel, it actually wasn't. Every character had a different name and the story was very different. Dracula was more horror-romance whereas this and the 1931 version with Bela Lugosi were just horror on its own. I suppose the 1931 one and this are sorta similar to each other. Let's get down straight to this first film of vampires, I have to say it was pretty good and funny enough, this is the first silent film I've ever understood more. It's probably that I'm very interested in vampire but that does mean I like Twlight here lol! Seriously although I do admire silent films, but never manage to get to understand them really since they are pretty much all over the shop! Max Schreck was actually pretty good as a vampire, the heavy make up was really scary indeed and the fangs too!Very good intro of vampirism and I'm glad to have finally watched this.

It's never boring, in fact i found it engrossing with amazing performances all around, plus, the ending is fantastic!. Ot has a lot of creepy scenes, especially when Nosferatu is aboard and walking around on the ship, plus, i believe it made it even creepier since it was silent and without a music score, plus, Max does not have that much screen time and that just makes him scarier. This is the best Vampire film ever made as far as i'm concerned it's also one of the best horror films ever made as well. The Direction is fantastic!. F.W. Murnau does a fantastic job with creating eerie mood, great scenery, and overall doing a fantastic job. There is no gore except a tiny cut on thumb.. The Acting is AMAZING!. Max Schrek gives an incredible performance here as Count Orlock, he is extremely creepy and those eyes, plus that slow creepy walk of his, and had some memorable dialog, his performance here will always be remembered!. Gustav Von Wangenheim is great as Hutter, he was very likable, had great chemistry with Greta Schröder was very believable, and his character was cool!. Greta Schröder is awesome here she was really into her role, and those eyes and shocked face expressions on her face were priceless, excellent job!.Alexander Granach is great as the crazy guy. Overall You must see this it's a required viewing for any horror fan! especially classic ones!, it's one of the best horror films out there! ***** out of 5",Nosferatu
59,ironhorse_iv,A symphony of horror indeed,8,18 October 2012,"1922 was when vampires were vampires not horny emotional teenagers with big teeth unlike Twilight. Nosferatu was directed by F.W. Murnau and starting Max Schreck as the Count Orlok. It's a chilling and eerie adaption of Stoker's Dracula, following the same plot somewhat and ever since it has first came to the screens in 1922, it has become a silent masterpiece of terror which to this day is the most striking and frightening portrayal of the legend. The old grainy black and white footage, and low frames per second recording somehow add to the creepiness of this film. Since it's public domain though, there have been several different re-releases over the years, a lot of which have music and voice overs that just seems out of place. It's hard to decide, when there is so many version of the film. There is a version where the music by Type O Negativesomewhere. Some of the campy music; there are moments when the tension of the music doesn't even fit what's happening on the screen. It's sad to watch. The original music was more Gothic in nature and better fit the feel for the movie. The music was originally composed by Hans Erdmann but the score was never recorded. This song is by far the greatest soundtrack to this movie! All the re-mastered versions suck! Not only did the remastered versions mess up the score, but also the picture by making it gold and blue. One problem in the film, is you can't really tell the different between night and day in this film so it's better to have it black and white for the picture. W. Murnau originally filmed Nosferatu in a color tinted version not black and white, for instance Murnau shot the night scenes in a blue tint and the day ones in a gold tint which really works at the end of film with the rising of the sun. The Kino DVD of Nosferatu is really beautiful. It's amazing how great actors had to be, by telling the story by body expressing. Max Schreck acting in Nosferatu is chilling. The Orlok make-up is so timeless. He doesn't close his eyes at any time during the film, which I find rather creepy. He was an eccentric who took his parts so seriously he remained in character during the entire shoot. Max was already known for his quirky and often seen as weird or obscure habits. He was a loner who enjoyed playing grotesque characters and mainly lived in his own world. It's a trait that adds to Schreck's macabre appearance. The other actors acting are somewhat slow and awkward. Gustav v. Wangenheim is just awful as Hutter. Makes you appreciate this classic! Interesting thing is that the name credits in this B&W film at the beginning are a bit off because Murnau didn't use any of the character's names from the original Stoker novel when he filmed Nosferatu so Bram Stoker's widow wouldn't sue him and his company, (she did though) which is why in the original German titles you have names like 'Graff Orlock' instead of Count Dracula and 'Hutter' in place of Harker and 'Ellen' in place of Mina. Only very loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel, which, I guess would have been too complex to make a film of without dialogue - and is probably over-complex anyway. It's better than Dracula somewhat. Thank goodness that the widow of Bram Stoker couldn't burn all the film due to the suing of Nosferatu. We are lucky to see this film due to that. True horror enters the soul and disturbs us, like a insecure feeling of helplessness. This film holds those emotions after all these years, it still frightens many people.",Nosferatu
60,The-Sarkologist,Another German Classic,8,4 June 2017,"If you are familiar with the story of Dracula, and by saying familiar I am actually referring to the book as opposed to the myriad of movies that have appeared since, then you are probably going to be somewhat familiar with this film. However, the thing is that this film has significantly cut down the original plot, and if there is one thing that really annoyed me it is that Dracula just gets killed that little bit too easily, and in a way that actually makes you wonder whether the film makers had just got a bit too lazy. Sure, there are plenty of plot holes in the original book, but why they ended this film the way they did is beyond me.Nosferatu is one of the classic films of the silent era, though having watched it a second time I sort of wonder whether it is a little overrated. Mind you, with the pace at which it was going, by the time Dracula arrived in Breman (it is set in Germany as opposed to London), we were only a third of the way through the book, and two thirds of the way through the film. As such I am not that surprised that I felt the movie could have at least gone on for another hour than what it did.So, for those who don't know (because you haven't actually read the book), the film is about how Dracula comes to Breman in order to create a nest of vampires. Through one of his agents, Renfeld, he has the lawyer Jonathon Harker go to Transylvania to arrange for the sale of a mansion. Once the sale is complete, Dracula locks Harker in the castle and then sets sail for Bremen, meanwhile feeding on the crew, and at the ports, along the way. He then begins to torment the wife of Jonathon Harker, Mina Harker, however Jonathon manages to escape, and they eventually defeat Dracula.There is actually quite a lot one could say on this film, but unfortunately there is simply not enough space on IMDb. The other thing is that most of the themes have been ported over from the book as well – such as the nature of evil, and an invasion of the empire. However, one needs to consider when the film was made – during the Weimer Republic at a time when Germany was still burdened by the sanctions placed upon it by the victors of World War I. In a sense it is not surprising that there is a very dark and gloomy undertone to the film, one that is actually looking forward to the deliverance in the future. The other thing is that this film is actually an unauthorised reproduction of the book, one that spurred some further interest in the writings of Bram Stoker, but not so much as to kick start the vampire madness that Hammer Horror did a couple of decades later.",Nosferatu

62,Thanos_Alfie,The first Dracula horror movie...,7,25 February 2015,"""Nosferatu"" is a horror movie which was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" with some changes because of rights, so they changed the names and from ""vampire"" became ""Nosferatu"" and ""Count Dracula"" became ""Count Orlok"". But the plot and also the storyline is about the same as we know it nowadays.I have to admit that even though this is an old movie I liked it because it is considered one of the must see horror movies in order to understand the history of horror. This movie maybe is considered as a just old horror movie that can not give you anything but I have to disagree with this opinion and for instance I have to say that this movie can give you a lot. Some of them are that this movie was the idea of vampires to be killed by sunlight and of course this movie was the start of horror movies in that times.Finally I believe that ""Nosferatu"" is a movie that everyone has to watch because through this you can have a historic lesson about cinema and of course horror. I have also to prepare you not to have any visual expectations from this movie or plenty of action but instead of this it has much of suspense. Also you have to take into consideration that this movie is about one hundred years old, so do not judge it hardly and also do not judge it before watching it.",Nosferatu
63,Dr_Coulardeau,Nosferatu made kosher,10,22 February 2007,"That old silent film is of course a classic. It comes from the German school of horror films in the 1920s. It is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it takes liberties with the original. It is situated in Bremen and not in London. His girlfriend or wife is quite rightly Mina. Rensfield is the boss of the real estate agency. The trip to Dracula's castle is standard. Dracula's voyage to Bremen is also very standard. The real change comes at the end when Mina sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to keep him active up to after the cock crows. Then he dies and everyone is saved. Naive rewriting of the ending into some palatable cathartic compensation of the horror of life : salvation is possible and escape is a real eventuality. But it is also a very Christian ending in a way, or isn't it Jewish after all ? The woman sacrificing herself for the sake of the social group that is menaced by Dracula. And this sacrifice is epiphanic since it brings salvation. This fantastic and horror period in the German cinema seems to be longing for a happy ending, just as if the reality of Germany then was so bleak that happiness could only be a dream and a consolation or a solace the cinema could propose to people. The film though is admirable by the quality of the pictures and the shooting. A black and white film on such a subject could easily become drab, which it never does. The pictures are always innovative in a way or another with a contrast or a composition that makes the poor technique of the days quite able to translate complex situations. The acting of these silent actors is also quite admirable in the body language they use that is never overdone which would make it grotesque. It is just expressive enough to mean what it is supposed to mean without any negative second level reading.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Nosferatu
64,poe426,The Silent Symphony of Count Doorlock...,10,30 October 2014,"Watching this one just this morning, I happened to be in the company of my niece's son, Louie. To make NOSFERATU interesting enough to hold the attention of a five-year-old, I resorted to doing the voices of the various characters (Peter Lorre and Edward G. Robinson lent their respective distinctive voices to the film). At one point, I thought I'd lost the kid: he picked up a pair of action figures and started playing with them. Then he looked up, just in time to see Max Schreck as Count Orlock walking toward the camera. ""It's Count Doorlock,"" he said. And so it will ever be. NOSFERATU still holds up, after nearly a hundred years: the use of negative images to lend an air of unreality to the proceedings (the coach ride to Castle Doorlock) is still a neat little trick, as was what was apparently the use of a mirror to suggest a ghostly apparition (Count Doorlock, seen by a ship's crewman sick with ""fever"") and Doorlock's Horizontal to Vertical rise, done without so much as the bending of a single limb. The whole notion of a vampire ""plague"" is still viable (and the analogy still so apt) that it's being used on television (THE STRAIN) and in print (THE NIGHT RIDERS, an xlibris book).",Nosferatu

67,TheMovieDiorama,Nosferatu really is a symphony of expressionistic horror.,8,3 October 2018,"In what is one of the more influential films from the German expressionist movement, this unauthorised adaptation of Stoker's beloved 'Dracula' has really stood the test of time. Murnau crafted a piece of cinematic history through innovative lighting techniques and astute artistry. Bolstering an interesting legacy, in particular the Stokers' court order to burn all existing prints, that add an extra flavour to the vampiric cult film. An employee of an estate agent is sent to Transylvania to meet his new client Count Orlok to sign an agreement enabling the purchase of a derelict property. But, something does not look right with Mr. Orlok. Could it be his elongated phalanges? Two sharp fangs? Or the fact he sleeps during the day in a coffin, sinks his teeth into the necks of the innocent and creeps around like a 'Scooby-Doo' villain? Suffice to say, Orlok is a daunting character and one that surprisingly got under my skin. Schreck's performance was simply chilling, with long cold stares into the camera as Murnau slowly zooms in on his expressionless face. I can't imagine what viewers went through back in 1922! However it's the combination of director Murnau and Wagner's cinematography that sparks life into this silent film. The atmosphere that was produced is quite extraordinary. From the quaint rural town to the unilluminated mountainous peaks of Transylvania. An authentic environment was built surprisingly well considering it was the era of silent films. The esteemed horror was generated through the inventive use of lighting. The infamous shot of Orlok walking up the stairs or when he reaches out his hand to claim his next neck. Simple, yet remarkably effective. The creative editing techniques also enabled illusory effects to take place, although haphazard occasionally. It's a shame that the second act lost its focus and the pace dipped quite substantially, to the point where I started to lose interest. However despite a familiar premise, it's something special. Intimidatingly influential for some, a horror masterpiece for others.",Nosferatu

70,SAMTHEBESTEST,Pioneering Vampire Films. German Cinema ranks above Hollywood.,8,19 October 2020,"NOSFERATU : A Symphony Of Horror (1922) :
Brief Review -Pioneering Vampire Films. German Cinema ranks above Hollywood. Nosferatu : A Symphony Of Horror was the first ever on screen adoration of popular Dracula and also a pioneer of such Horror films if I'm not wrong, then definitely the film has aged well and how, like no other film. One of the famous critic said great lines about the film which goes something like this, ""Here is the original real tale of Dracula before it was buried alive in TV shows, Jokes, Cartoons and many films"". How accurate a critic can be. Nosferatu doesn't harm a single segment from the nostalgia of ""Dracula"" despite being an unauthorised version of the novel and several noticeable changes. ""This was definitely not Hollywood"", someone said it rightly. In talkies era Hollywood had many Horror Classics but German Cinema ranked above in Silence Era with film like this. Nosferatu doesn't need any brief of the story, we all know something about Dracula since childhood but it was made in early 20s when not the entire world was aware about this horrifying tale. So, Nosferatu had a burden to bring the story on screen for the first time and let the people know what it is actually which can be called an advantage too, however, the impact was generally beyond time and cultural boundries. Max Schrek made Orlak's character memorable by all means. I don't know how many actors portrayed this character later but i am not gonna forget this brilliant exposure by him. The leading pair Gustav von Wangenheim and Greta Schröder were excellent too. Coming in the early 20s the film never looked like doing any bloomer or compromise in the storytelling, rather it came out as an Influential Masterpiece which set benchmarks for the Horror Genre in Cinema World. I recall watching so many scenes in multiple projects and now it feels so great to have watched the original version of all those iconic scenes. Afterall original is orginal, no matter how old it is. This F. W. Murnau's Timeless and Landmark Classic is unbeatable. We do have advanced technology available today to make Horror films looks more dangerous and appealing with extra use of disturbing visuals and Screams in Dolby Atmos but we don't have the original and incredible vision like those legends. Technology and Science can never beat Nostalgia. Period.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Nosferatu

Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will. No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible. MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle.

We watched the film while someone played the organ music to correspond with the scenes in the film. I'll admit it was a fun experience since it was one of those community gatherings in October. But also Dracula is one of my favorite fictional foes/monsters and I've seen several versions of Dracula before, my favorite the Francis Ford Copila version in my book but this film has a special place in my heart because it was the first (or one of if any other lost versions of Dracula are found)shot in bringing Dracula to the visual medium.There's not a whole lot I can really say about this film, it's pretty straight forward vampire film but done right. The orchastratic score that goes with it is great and fits with the grim dark atmosphere the film has. However it's the visuals in this film are just stunning and to me are what really have made it a classic.Of course the monster in the film Count Orlok is the star of the film and not hard to see why. That face of his truly is creepy and menacing, the make up work was really impressive and holds up to this day. This vampire is basically a humanoid bat creature, those eyes which look as though they could stare into your soul, pale white skin, big ears, sharp rat teeth, long fingers and nails, and the height of him which almost made him look like a giant. This character was simply a heartless beast whose goal was just to simply suck blood where ever and who ever he can find it. The way this character moves is also creepy because of how strange and varied the speed is, almost like some figure from your nightmares.But I feel the other star is simply the shadowy enviorment and the shadows that are always around Orlok. They really create a nightmarish dreamlike atmosphere my favorite enviorment set peace was no surprise Orlok's Castle which had all of the best places for shadows, and the look of it was simply menacing, creepy, gritty, which perfectly reflected Orlok's psyche. But also reinforce Orlock as a force of evil, the way he casts his shadow it is constantly growing tall and spreading trying to block out the light completely like a plague trying to spread. This of course gives some memorable visuals like my favorite one of Orlok creeping up the stairs toward a room, or his shadow creeping closer toward someone's bed.Well there's really nothing more to say, except beware of the shadows.Rating: 4 stars",Nosferatu

The version that these comments are based on is the purported 2006 final 94 minute restoration with color tints and released by Kino Video. Directed by the legendary German director F.W. Murneau it follows the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" story fairly consistently. Murneau had some issues with the Stoker family forcing him to change the character's names. Count Dracula becomes Count Orlok for example. This version though, credits Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" as the source material for this film.Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) and his wife Ellen (Greta Schroder) are a happily married couple living in 1838 Wisbourg, Germany. Hutter's slightly mad boss, Real Estate agent Knock (Alexander Ganach) send Hutter to the castle of Count Orlok (Max Schreck) to oversee the purchase, for some unkexplained reason, by Orlock of a creepy house across from where Hutter and Ellen live.Hutter embarks on the journey. When he reaches the little town near Orlok's castle, he is warned that the werewolf is roaming about and that he should delay his departure until morning. He is also warned about strange goings on at the castle. As they near Orlok's castle the coachman abruptly stops and letts Hutter out in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly a dark coach with a mysterious driver arrives and takes Hutter to the castle and then speeds off into the night.Inside the castle, Hutter meets Count Orlok a somber thin man with bulging eyes. During the night in his room Orlok appears as a rat like zombie who unbeknownst to Hutter, leaves his mark on his neck. After signing the necessary papers to seal the purchase, Hutter is locked in his room while Orlock makes preparations to depart for Wisbourg.Orlok hires a ship and sails for Germany. The crew begin to die off with the Captain and First Mate the only survivors. Seeing the rat filled hold, they suspect that a plague has taken hold of the ship. Meanwhile Hutter escapes from the castle and in a weakened state (from loss of blood) makes his way back home.When several deaths in the town occur, a plague is blamed, but we all know who is behind the deaths don't we. Ellen learns through a book on vampirism that her husband has, that the only way to destroy this evil being is to keep him ""on the job"" until sunrise.

To be honest though, after seeing clips of this and all the parodies and homages and what not, I wasn't even sure if I had seen the film or not, but I've watched it now and am glad to say that even though it's roughly a couple of hundred years old, it's great!Johnathon Harker, estate agent, is sent by his boss Renfield to Transalvania, where he's to sell a house to Count Dracula (in the version I had anyway). He's only taken so far by the locals, who leave him outside the 'land of phantoms'. Not before long a creepy carriage picks him up and drops him outside of the castle, where the Count reads over a letter from Renfield, and then tries to drink his blood when Harker cuts his finger.Harker's a bit confused by this, and even more confused when he wakes up in the morning with a sore neck, but shrugs it off (the guy playing him is a bit goofy, at least for the first half of the film). Thanks to a handy 'Vampires for idiots' book that he's found, Harker discovers that the guy who sleeps all day, likes blood, and remarked about how Harker's wife had a lovely neck is actually a vampire! And he was hiding it so well! Worse still, Harker's now trapped in the castle and Dracula (or Nosferatu or Orlock) is bound for Bremen in boat full of soon to be dead sailors. Can Harker make it back in time?Apart from the phrase ""German Expressionism"" I know nothing about German Expressionism, but if that means loads of mood, shadows, Gothic atmosphere, long fingernails, swooning, images of coffins being carried through the streets, then I'm all for it. This film was a blast from start to finish, with nary a moment wasted. If I had a time machine I'd back to 1922 and say 'mad props' to Max Schreck, whatever that means.",Nosferatu
80,jamesrupert2014,Great expressionist horror film,9,24 March 2019,"A sinister count moves to a town in Germany, leaving Transylvania following a plague characterised by puncture wounds to the neck. The film is an unauthorised version of ""Dracula"" and was almost lost when Bram Stoker's widow sued the German production company and demanded all copies be destroyed. With the exception of Max Schreck who plays the titular vampire, the acting is typical of melodramatic silent films: theatrical and 'unrealistic', and has not aged well. Schreck in the other hand is outstanding and his depiction of the otherworldly 'Count Orlak' is what makes the film a horror icon. Director F. W. Murnau makes excellent use of early camera tricks (stop motion, dissolves, jump cuts, etc) to give the film an unreal feel and images of the sinister, skeletal Count are some of the most famous in the genre. A fantastic relic from an earlier age of film-making and a must see for horror films fans or lover of early cinema. Note: I saw the film at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver with live music (debut of a new score by Andrew Downing) featuring the Vancouver Bach choir. The title and intertitle cards were in English.",Nosferatu
81,Polaris_DiB,Pestilence and weightiness,6,23 November 2005,"Here is the mighty Murnau masterpiece, the Nosferatu movie that everyone raves about. Contained within is an adaptation of the immortal Stoker story, Dracula, where a disturbingly lethal vampire hunts the streets and sucks the blood of innocents! Too bad I'm slightly disappointed.Murnau obviously has skill, I'll give him that, I can see his creativity and inspiration really saturating the imagery of his films. Unfortunately, the whole atmosphere of this movie doesn't quite seem to cut it. It's too bright, so to speak, and the pacing is where it falls apart. I've seen clips of the ending in many different documentaries, film classes, and the like, and it's rather well done except that it seems to interrupt the steady silentness of the stalking killer. It just washes away magically......and you can see him in the mirror, which goes against a major plot point around the beginning of the story when Jonathon sees the door open in the mirror, turns around and sees Nosferatu standing there. *Sigh* Anyways, the key staying power of this film is the imagery of Nosferatu himself, Max Schreck looking downright deadly in his tall, bat-eared stance. The shadow-work of course is another brilliant part, and it's a joy to see it so clearly defined and strong against the background, very much helping the feeling of stalking doom.Secondly, the motif of the disease is interesting. I love the idea of the Pestilence eating away at a community while individuals struggle with the source of the evil. Played better (or maybe, *GASP*, remade???), it definitely creates a good, haunting story.I can see why this film is worshiped, I just have a few problems with it's exposition. It deserves a watch, but I'm not quite sure it exactly deserves all that praise.--PolarisDiB",Nosferatu

Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying. I don't think it was intended but I found the chase near the very end very funny and the ending was okay-ish for time.7 out of 10 it's was really good movie",Nosferatu

84,estebangonzalez10,"It will cost you sweat and tears, and perhaps a little blood.",6,8 May 2014,"""It will cost you sweat and tears, and perhaps... a little blood.""I would probably give this film 5 stars if I were to base it on appreciation for how it influenced many films during the silent era and served as a landmark for the horror genre. F.W. Murnau played a key role in the German Expressionist movement and Nosferatu is one of its greatest examples. This movement went on to influence other great directors such as Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock especially in the way they played with shadows and lighting to express the emotions of their characters and enhance the mood of their films. This silent film might have scared audiences in the 20's, but it is really outdated and I struggled to maintain my interest in the story. I have to give it credit for shaping modern horror films today and also influencing the film noir genre, but no matter how much I appreciate it, Nosferatu was far from entertaining for me. One of my favorite things about this film was Count Orlok's makeup which was really creepy, along with how Murnau used the lighting and played with shadows to build the suspense. Those moments were great, but the story really didn't lead up to much and Orlok got very little screen time. I'd personally recommend watching those brief scenes instead of sitting through the entire film. The film uses a lot of title cards and they leave them on screen for so long you could practically read everything twice. There is no denying this was a masterpiece, but I had a hard time sticking with it.The screenplay was written by Henrik Galeen, heavily stealing from its source material, Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. In Nosferatu we are first introduced to a real estate agent named Knock (Alexander Granach) who is sending his associate, Hutter (Gustav von Wagenheim) to Count Orlak's (Max Schreck) castle in Transylvania. Orlak is looking to buy a house in Wisbourg, and Knock is considering selling him the home next to Hutter's. Hutter realizes this is a great opportunity to make some money so he leaves his wife, Ellen (Greta Schröder), with some friends while he embarks on the long journey. Along the way several people warn him about the strange events that occur at night near Orlak's castle, but he continues on. Once he reaches the castle, he has an awkward conversation with Orlak and when he accidentally cuts his finger he realizes that Orlak is in fact a Nosferatu (vampire). When Orlak sees a picture of Ellen he quickly decides to buy the new home and is shipped to Wisbourg in a coffin. On the way back several crew members of the ship mysteriously die and some sort of plague seems to have reached the city. Hutter and Ellen know what's really going on, but the question is whether or not they can stop this evil creature.Nosferatu is all about the eerie atmosphere that Murnau managed to create with a very low budget. It turned away from the standard action-adventure and comedy films of the silent era by creating something unique and exploring such emotions as fear and suspense. Most contemporary horror films probably have to credit Murnau for being a landmark film and setting the stage for them. Nosferatu is a Gothic stylized film that has influenced the way we view cinema today so we owe Murnau a lot of gratitude for his work. Unfortunately films are subjective and despite my appreciation for this film I did not enjoy it as much as other film lovers. I did like the cast and the editing however, but the pacing of the film was what I had issues with.",Nosferatu
85,AAdaSC,A let-down,4,7 November 2010,"Mr Orlock/Nosferatu (Max Schreck) is a freak. He wants to buy a secluded house opposite Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) and so Hutter, an estate agent, travels to Transylvania where Mr Orlock lives with the deeds to the new property for him to sign. He gets there, the deal is done and he returns. Orlock arrives at his new house and takes a fancy to Hutter's wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder). She realizes that she must make a sacrifice to stop the evil one.....This film is only good for the scenes with Nosferatu. You have to completely suspend belief with the story. There is NO WAY that Hutter would stick around at Orlock's castle after seeing him. NO WAY. But then again, he is an estate agent so he deserves to get bitten by the vampire freak. Or does he? Is it only mosquito bites that he has? The majority of the film is pretty dull and Hutter is a smiling idiot. The character of ""Knock"" played by Alexander Granach is very peculiar indeed. He is described as being a little odd - wow! That's an understatement. He is as big a freak as Nosferatu and becomes the town's scapegoat for all the deaths that are suddenly occurring. The only character that achieves any kind of emotional connection with the audience is Ellen. The film storyline is not always clear so you have to make assumptions while you are watching and there is no grand build-up to a climax. The film is suddenly at the denouement. This film has a scary monster - that's all.",Nosferatu
86,Cristi_Ciopron,An admiring reading;the outcasts' drives and secrets,9,10 August 2008,"We may say in what sense _vampirism tales are symbolic, allegorical, metaphorsvampires ,like addicts, let people state loudly the character of urgency of certain needs. Even if not explicitly related to sex or other vigorous needs, _vampirism serves as a vehicle for expressing the urgency of these direct needs. Ordinary people, average undistinguished people rather often feel a desire and push as strong as that felt by the vampire or the addictthe outcasts of the normal society. I agree that in many cases _vampirism is a pretext for giving shape to inner needs and impulses. The vampire, the addict need to feedthey need it urgently; this allows people to talk about needs other than the professed onesmore directly, secret needs.Being an implacable foe of _allegorizing in either film or literary criticism, I am myself amazed that I came to speak about the allegoric ,symbolic, hidden, metaphoric content of Dracula's tale. In NOSFERATU this content is expressed better and more powerful than in perhaps any other rendition of the tale; it might be the single adaptation also that makes the book interesting. Al the other Dracula films that I know are more or less exploitation crap.It is understood that I do not mean _vampirism/ addiction as a metaphor for venereal/ infectious diseases, etc., but as an image of secret urges and needs, of a nature either organic or moral. Vampirism and sexuality are obviously mirrored; the same goes for yet another private sides.And yet I am not saying that _vampirism is a mask, a subterfuge, a means to an end. I only explained why a well made vampires story, like NOSFERATU, impresses so powerfully. At least some of its power comes from this. We are at least shown on screen the force of the drives, of the needs. This does not explain all; it explains something. We are shown how urgent is the needof the vampire, of the addict; we are unaccustomed with such things on screen. It takes its material from the inner hidden experience; therefore, it is effective. But of course the majority of the horror directors lack this flair.Besides,NOSFERATU reopened my taste for the great literary ancestors (Stoker's, Miss Shelley's stuff ...).",Nosferatu

89,slokes,"""Pictures Of Life Fade Into Shadows...""",8,2 May 2009,"""Nosferatu"" is one of those rare non-comedy silent films that actually improves with time. This flickering keepsake of a long-dead past, shot in oddly-tinted black-and-white with mouths that move but which we can not hear, casts an almost sepulchral aura of peeking into a grave. We come to this film expecting fear, but what ""Nosferatu"" delivers is dread.The first of many films based on Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" (though its failure to do so officially nearly led to its being throttled in its crib by Stoker's widow), ""Nosferatu"" is the story of Hutter, an ambitious realtor who gets more than he bargained for when he sells a house overlooking his own home to Count Orlok (Max Schreck). Orlok, you see, is really Nosferatu, a vampyre (that's the way it's spelled in the titles), and Nosferatu has taken an unholy interest in Hutter's wife, Ellen (Greta Schröder).As Orlok famously observes: ""Is that your wife? What a lovely throat.""It's a famous line, but deceptive, too. There's not much humor in ""Nosferatu"", even of the dark kind. Schreck is so full of dark menace and rat-like ugliness that it defies belief he can move around the streets of a large German town without being noticed. But Schreck is also one of the most convincing monsters ever put on screen, no thanks to CGI or even much makeup beyond some putty around the ears and kohl around the eyes. He's more zombie than vampire, his eyes seemingly dead as he makes his grand entrance into Hutter's bedroom, memorably backlit as Hutter cowers helplessly under the sheets. Just try and get that image out of your head once you've seen it!Director F.W. Murnau launches the horror film genre in fine style, with special effects that still cast a spell long after technology has moved on. Maybe it helps we don't expect in 1922 to see tricks involving double exposure and stop-motion photography seamlessly integrated into a storyline.Murnau ditches some elements of the Dracula story, reducing the character of Van Helsing into a barely-there character Bulwar, ""a Paracelsian"", which connotes some mysticism ""Nosferatu"" never quite delves into. There's also Knock, Hutter's boss, who has the Renfield role, driven crazy either from proximity to Nosferatu (though the two never meet) or just from wearing his pants up to his armpits.The performance of Alexander Granach as Knock, and Gustav von Wangenheim as Hutter, are very broad by today's standards. It's a 90-minute movie, but one that could have stood another 20 minutes of cuts. In addition to the padding involving Bulwar, we have some strange logic gaps, like when the crewmen of a ship open one of the boxes they have been charged to transport by Nosferatu, discover nothing inside it but dirt and rats, and then take on the rest of the cargo anyway. Surely that was not what the manifest said the boxes contained. So why transport it at all?But of course ""Nosferatu"" is really not meant to work on that level. It's a film about the inexplicable, like how Knock cries ""Blut ist Leben!"" and Ellen wanting Nosferatu's rat claws around her young body, melting in desire when she sees the ugly count staring at her from the window opposite her bedroom. This works in ""Dracula"" because Bela Lugosi had charm, but Max Schreck?What seems to draw morbid Ellen is the lure of the grave, the most powerful common element in ""Nosferatu"", more so now than ever as the actual making of the film passes from living memory.",Nosferatu
90,Witchfinder-General-666,The Uniquely Mesmerizing and Nightmarish Classic of All Classics,10,19 December 2010,"There are great films, there are masterpieces, and then there are a bunch of films that simply MUST be seen by anybody even remotely interested in the art of cinema, and ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"" doubtlessly belongs in the latter category. Not only is F.W. Murnau's 1922 German Expressionist silent adaptation of the Dracula story the scariest and most atmospheric filmic version of Bram Stoker's novel, it is doubtlessly one of the most atmospheric films of all-time, and arguably even THE most influential Horror film ever made. The iconic status of ""Nosferatu"" is almost unequaled. The picture of Max Schreck in his immortal role of Count Orlock has long become a synonym for the Horror genre.But ""Nosferatu"" is not simply a must-see for being such an important classic. To this day, it is simply one of the creepiest masterpieces ever accomplished, thanks both to F.W. Murnau's magnificent atmospheric genius and the uniquely haunting screen presence of Max Schreck (whose name oddly translates ""Max Fright""). I am a huge admirer of both Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, and I love both of them in their roles of Count Dracula, but neither man's eeriness (nor that of any other screen Dracula) comes close to the nightmarish power of Max Schreck's demonic stare, which infests any viewer of this film. This is what nightmares are made of.The unspeakable gloom of ""Noferatu"" is created by almost all aspects of the film. The wonderful settings simply ooze atmosphere, and the grainy picture of the early 20s film suggests the weird impression of actually being filmed in an old and mysterious time. Since the storyline of ""Dracula"", which ""Nosferatu is based on, is generally known, I don't suppose it necessary to give a plot description of this film. Angered by the fact that her permission was not asked Bram Stoker's widow Florence Stoker tried to get the film confiscated and the copies destroyed, and this Classic of all Horror Classics therefore owes its survival to lucky coincidences. Very lucky, that is, as ""Nosferatu"" is doubtlessly one of the most precious pieces of art that cinema has ever brought forth. There are not enough words for me to appropriately praise ""Nosferatu"". The film simply is brilliant in every detail. The cinematography, the settings, Max Schreck... every aspect of ""Nosferatu"" is part of creating an incomparable atmosphere of pure gloom. As said above, this film simply MUST be seen by everyone even remotely interested in film. I strongly suggest to get a good copy featuring the original Soundtrack on DVD.

Like the movie K-PAX, the audience is only interested in the film when the main character (Kevin Spacey / Nosferatu) is on the screen. When the main event is not on the big screen, the film becomes a giant bore. The rest of the film is an average film from the 1920's. The magic that makes Nosferatu is Nosferatu himself. The outrageous makeup and costume, to the manner in which he walks and moves makes him true eye candy in the sense of the word.",Nosferatu
92,Steffi_P,"""What a lovely throat""",9,6 November 2006,"FW Murnau's Nosferatu - the most famous silent horror film, the first adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula and containing some of the most memorable and terrifying images ever committed to celluloid.The German Expressionist directors can be credited with inventing the horror genre. Not that works with a horror theme hadn't been made earlier elsewhere, but the Germans were the first filmmakers to actually use the medium of cinema to frighten the audience. In Nosferatu this is not just done by the disturbing look of the vampire, but by a number of cinematic techniques. For example, the huge distorted shadows are more eerie than seeing the real thing. He also nearly always has the vampire walking towards the camera, as if he is advancing upon the audience.Max Shrek's as Dracula (or Graf Orlok, depending on the version) has to rank as one of the best performances of silent cinema. Not only is the vampire a brilliantly creepy creation in makeup, but the way Shrek moves and positions himself  stiff, spindly and slow, like an animated corpse  completes the character. The parts of the original Dracula novel which dealt with the vampire's ability to change into the shapes of various animals was dropped for Nosferatu, but Murnau references them by having Shrek creep like a rat, hunch his shoulders like a bat, rub his hands together like a fly and so on.Other than Max Shrek, the other actors are decent but not outstanding. The performances are highly melodramatic and exaggerated, even by silent film standards. This was probably a deliberate request by Murnau to heighten the unreal quality throughout the picture, although having said that he favoured over-the-top performances even in straight dramas like Sunrise (1927).Murnau had a great eye for space. His shots are often reminiscent of works by the Dutch painter Vermeer  cramped interiors with open doors leading to distant vanishing points. This helps to give the film a tight, claustrophobic feel.Like DW Griffith, Murnau makes extensive use of cross-cutting. However, whereas Griffith would use cross-cutting to make comparisons between historical events or to create a tense race-against-time, in Nosferatu the effect is much more psychological. He reveals the psychic link between Jonathon and Nina by cutting between him being attacked by the vampire and her nightmare; he defines Renfield by cutting from him to Van Helsing describing a carnivorous plant; he shows Nina's troubled mental state by cutting from her sleepwalking to shots of the raging sea.Nosferatu is an early landmark in horror films. It's not Murnau's best though, and also sadly due to its history there are no perfect prints available. But the fact that it is still so well known and still has the power to creep out modern audiences is testament to it as a great piece of film-making.",Nosferatu
93,rbverhoef,Artistry in silent classic,9,20 October 2005,"The problem with films like 'Nosferatu, eine Symphony des Grauens' is that they are easily admired but harder to enjoy. I can not think of a modern audience that would really like to see a movie like this. I enjoyed the artistry of the film, the images (there are a great deal of memorable ones), therefore I was able to have a great time, but how many people these days will see the brilliance in some of the shots? My guess is not so many.Director F.W. Murnau's version of the Dracula-story is one of the best known silent films and that could be a reason for people to see it. But I have to be honest here. Other well-known silent classics are better films to start with if you want to give them a try. 'The Battleship Potemkin' (1925) from Sergei Eisenstein still has a lot of its impact, Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' (1925) still feels sweet and funny, Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) contains many more memorable images. Maybe all this is just a matter of opinion. Still, there are images you definitely will remember and although they are not scary in the modern sense they are kind of creepy.Especially the scenes where Graf Orlok (or Dracula, played by Max Schreck) suddenly appears have quite some impact. I will not go into the story, which follows most of Bram Stoker's story pretty closely, since for me it is not really about the story. Besides the images we have the Schreck-performance and appearance which is completely different from every other Dracula we know. Bela Lugosi's Dracula in the 1931 film has become the standard for Dracula in the movies. Schreck looks more like a rat than a bat and instead of a charismatic man (like Lugosi and Gary Oldman in Francis Ford Coppola's version from 1992) he is ugly and creepy. It helps the silent version. His appearance fits Murnau's haunting images and there is a shot where Schreck erects from a coffin which belongs to the best remembered scenes from the silent era. If Schreck would have looked like a gentleman the power of the shot was probably lost.See 'Nosferatu' if you are interested in things like this, for its place in the history of cinema, to admire the work of one of the greatest director's the world has known.",Nosferatu
94,truemythmedia,Not Just a Great Silent Film; A Great Film!,9,14 May 2019,"""Nosferatu"" is one of the silent film era greats, and, in my opinion, it is the greatest vampire movie of cinema's adolescences. While Dreyer's ""Vampyr"" is creepy and atmospheric, and it plays wonderfully with light and shadow, it doesn't hold a candle to the terrifying performance of Max Schreck as Count Orlok. Bela Lugosi's performance in ""Dracula"", which, I might add, is far less faithful to its namesake's source material than this film, is practically laughable when compared to Schreck.
F.W. Murnau's direction is brilliantly on point. He uses the film's admittedly sparse production design to his advantage, filling up the empty spaces with darkness and shadow, allowing Schreck's performance to be the focal point of every scene, while still developing the world around him. There are beautifully framed shots, wonderful use of silent era special effects, and a remarkably dark ending that will stay with the viewer for a while after the last title card has faded from screen.
I was incredibly excited to revisit ""Nosferatu"" as I had only seen it one time before this. A second viewing really solidified this film as not only a great film from the silent era, but a great film period. I predict this movie's influence will stretch well beyond the century mark; this is a film that will ever be remembered and revered by cinephiles, as well it should. For those looking to try their hand at silent films for the first time, this is a pretty good place to start. It is a touch slow in the beginning, but the moment Orlok hits the screen, I was entranced until the end.",Nosferatu

96,Galina_movie_fan,First and the best of vampire movies,10,12 February 2009,"Sometimes, I think that from over hundred years of Cinema history the best, the most creative and exciting years were in the relative beginning, in the first decades of the 20th Century. The old films that I've watched lately don't seem old - they are timeless. Their beauty and mystery -unsurpassable, their influence - immense, the pleasure they bring - incomparable. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens made in 1922 by F.W. Murnau is one of these movies. It is so finely crafted, so well thought of, so lovingly produced, so beautiful to look at, and so creepy and genuinely scary that I believe it will stay one of the best films of the horror genre and true inspiration for present and future directors, and not just horror film directors. A Symphony of Horror is a pure cinematic delight, poetry on screen from the first shot to the final. Werner Herzog came quite close in 1979 in his updated color version of the same film but I prefer Murnau's film a bit more, perhaps, because it was the first one and Murnau had no previous film to compare to or more likely, because no one, even fabulous Kinski could not be as creepy and frightening as Max Shreck.The B&W photography with astounding use of sepia gave some scenes a somber dramatic, Gothic tone. Each frame deserved to be captured and enjoyed for the sheer beauty and elegance. The scenery was breathtaking, storytelling - solid and compelling. Hans Erdman's 1922 score created a perfect sound background for the story. The most fascinating asset of the film though was not even acting but simply presence of Max Shreck. What a mesmerizing magnificent ugliness that would not let you take your eyes off his face, fangs, ears, and spider like fingers.

This couple of course is going to be the protagonists and the ones that will see everything in a different way. The journey begins for Thomas and he will be just interested on his mission no matter if a lot of people around don't want to get close to his destination, they are afraid of it. At this point the -relevant- book of the vampires (it is called like that in the version of my DVD) is even like a joke for Thomas. But he will feel the horror as Ellen. Graf Orlok (Max Schreck) arrives, the plague arrives, the death arrives. The place is full of fear, some persons carrying the coffins makes a terrific scene. Graf Orlok has many memorable scenes, the performance of Schreck is just unique but there are some scenes that are unforgettable: Graf Orlok on the ship, his shadow but damn he was reflected! I like a lot how this versions ends, the woman knew this: a woman pure in heart must make him forget the rooster's first crowing.The historical value of this film is enough to consider it a ""must-see film"". It has a difficult past, problems with the copyright and with Florence Stoker. But this one is a unique version, a great version. A lot of that is thanks to Schreck. Here everything relies in the atmosphere and of course in the presence. The vampire is not elegant, the vampire is everything else but that.

It doesn't have to rely on cheap jump-scares and over the top violence, but instead sends chills down the viewers spine with great atmosphere, directing, and an unforgettably creepy performance by Max Schreck.Its surreal and dreamlike atmosphere manages to be created all thanks to Murnau's cinematic vision. His films reflect a true love of dreams-and ""Nosferatu"" feels just like a dream or, rather, like a nightmare. He's one of the cinematic pioneers that proved that film that doesn't need to be in any way lifelike, and that you can really do anything in front of a camera. The movies are magic, and that's what ""Nosferatu"" (and all other Murnau masterpieces) prove.""Nosferatu"" (along with ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"") is the most famous and widely beloved of the German Expressionist classics.

99,Sergeant_Tibbs,The scariest film of all-time for Max Schreck alone.,9,24 October 2014,"My choice for the scariest horror film ever made (with considerable honourable mention to Ridley Scott's Alien) is the quintessential vampire film – F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens. Made in 1922, its age is part of the reason why it's so strikingly horrific. It feels all the more tangible and eerie, especially due to it being shot on location rather than a soundstage. It doesn't offer shock horror that we're so used to and desensitized from these days, given its silence, but instead incites an overwhelming sense of unease. Is there anything more convincingly ghastly than Max Schreck as Count Orlok? A substitute here for Bram Stoker's famous Dracula due to rights issues, but a character that is no less a part of pop culture.The figure of the vampire seems to be no longer one of horror. Saturated and romanticized over recent years of PG-13 young adult films, not to mention an abundance of parodies, Schreck's performance however still stands tall as an iconic monument in monster movies. Perhaps it is due to the nature of the character in this context. Klaus Kinski almost meets Schreck's match in Herzog's 1979 Nosferatu remake (it takes a lot to claim that Kinski has been outdone in the scary faces department), and Willem Dafoe's committed portrayal of the actor in the mediocre Shadow of a Vampire is one of the greatest performances of all-time in its own right.While myths perpetuated in the aforementioned film wherein Schreck is believed to be so convincing as a vampire because he is one are easy to shake off, he does indeed bring an otherworldly atmosphere. Even when he does nothing in the frame but stand, the film has a crippling tension in his enigmatic mystery. His grotesque rat-like makeup with his pointed ears and bulky nose, his tall rigid intimidating figure, the claws of his hands and nails, and the hollowness of his face are all pure nightmare fuel. Even his silhouette sends shivers down my spine. Schreck uses the tool of his body impeccably to create a sense of perpetual menace.Its most haunting scene comes just passed the midway point when the film's protagonist has escaped from the vampire's castle and Orlok slowly follows him via a ship transporting coffins. The image of Orlok springing out of a coffin is chilling. As he kills off the sailors, which is later blamed on the plague, it suggests a sinister omniscience and omnipotence about him that previous scenes couldn't implicate, and it hints at the crushing inevitability of death.Even so, it isn't as overtly expressionistic as other German films of the time, especially Murnau's own films, but that restraint only makes it more generous to the actors and the story. The simplicity of the iconic frames of looming shadows is enough to withstand 92 years. The film outside of Schreck is still quite notable, in its storytelling ideas (it was the first vampire film to suggest that they could be killed by sunlight) and penetrating themes of fear, narcissism, sexuality and death. Nosferatu is as thoughtful as it is unsettling. I was lucky to see it with a live orchestra two years ago and that experience has stayed with me since. An essential horror film.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",Nosferatu
100,frankde-jong,Not the gentleman Dracula but a far more sinister creature,9,4 September 2020,"Bram Stokers ""Dracula"" (1897) has many film adaptations. Only a few of them are classics. In the adaptations of Tod Browning (1931) and Terence Fisher (1958) Dracula is a gentleman and there is a lot of Victorian moralism about sexuality. The adaptations of Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau (1922) and Carl Theodor Dreyer (1932) are much more sinister.""Nosferatu"" is based on the slavic words ""nosufur atu"" which means ""he who brings the plague"". By avoiding the name ""Dracula"" it was attempted to save on copyrights to (the widow of) Bram Stoker. The resulting copy right issues had for a long time a negative effect on the availability of the movie. The adaptation of Carl Theodor Dreyer (""Vampyr"") also avoids the name Dracula, but this film is based on a novel by Sheridan Le Fanu. Sheridan Le Fanu is (also) an Irish writer who precedes Bram Stoker in writing about vampires.In 1979 Werner Herzog made a successful remake of ""Nosferatu"" with Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani.",Nosferatu
101,TheUnknown837-1,"Count Orlok may not terrify us as he did ninety years ago, but the image of a corpse-like vampire continues to haunt us",8,26 October 2009,"I had an interesting reaction to F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror."" At no point in watching this film did I feel any genuine, visceral terror. Even though it features one of the most physically off-putting characters of all time, the movie never actually gave me the shivers. That came about an hour later, as I was tossing and turning around, trying to fall asleep. Lying in that dark empty room, I kept on picturing the movie's iconic images of a corpse-like vampire crouching over his victims as they slept. I kept on imagining my closet doors as the castle passages in the film, and that at some point, they were going to swing open under their own power. One minute, they would be vacant, and the next there would be Count Orlok walking unhurriedly, striving to quench his thirst for blood. That kept me up through all hours of the night.For me, the terror came not in the actual moment of viewing, but afterward. I have seen ""Nosferatu"" four or five times in the past couple of years, and each time, it has registered the same effect on me. It has a haunting quality that cannot be ignored, even if it is not as viscerally gripping as it probably was to the people who first saw it ninety years ago. And although it does not make my blood pump like some other entries in the horror genre, it is not, save for a small stretch in the middle, a dull experience. It is full of unforgettable images and a quintessential, of-its-time atmosphere.Perhaps the movie's grandest achievement is the ever-going presence of its villain. And that is really saying something, seeing as how Count Orlok, the titular nosferatu, only has about ten minutes of screen time to his name. Ignoring his physical grandeur, one can feel the vampire's authority hanging over every scene like a specter. One that cannot be fought off or evaded, that is until an innocent maiden sticks her neck out (literally) to save Europe. In this sense, ""Nosferatu"" is a defining example of German Expressionism: an art movement prevalent in the movies as well as paintings during the 20th century in which the creator would provide an inner feeling through some distorted version of reality. And what distorted version of reality would work better than the idea of vampires: carcasses rising from the earth to feed on the flesh of the living. No matter how many times our parents remind us that these are just fictional entities, most of us can never quite shake the impression that there are some things in this world we cannot explain or expect. Especially when it's late at night, and you are all alone in a dark house.But the vampire's physical presence cannot be ignored, either. I do not know how much is owed to Max Schreck's performance as Count Orlok or the fabulous make-up work, whose creator I really wish I could name. But this is one of the most visually memorable characters in cinema history. Count Orlok is not so much a man as he is a rodent. He bears no hair of his own, pointed little ears, a narrow lower jaw eerily reminiscent of a snout, and big expressionless eyes with heavy dark shadows hanging beneath them. But best of all are the fangs, positioned smack-dab in the middle of the upper mawagain, much more like a rat than a man. Add to that Max Schreck's lean, limber posture and stiff movements (movements deliberately slow, as they are made by a creature with no reason to hurry) and Count Orlok quickly becomes visually disturbing. He may not terrify us as he did nine decades ago, but the image of a corpse-like vampire continues to haunt us.Certain elements of ""Nosferatu"" have dated, most of them the simple practical camera tricks that director F.W. Murnau had to utilize to suggest a supernatural element. But to his credit, he does apply them enough times so that the kitsch element wears off and we start buying them as part of this world. For instance, Count Orlok's carriage: footage of horses pulling a rig played at irregularly fast speed. By today's standards, and keeping in mind that it was very easy to over-crank a camera by accident in the silent era, the effect does look silly. As do some of the time-lapse shots of coffin lids crawling upon their boxes. Whether it was Mr. Murnau's genius or just lucky accidents, the constant usage of these tricks do eventually, as the film progresses, seem to meld it and become part of this fantasy.There is a twenty-minute stretch in the middle, as the vampire travels from Transylvania to (I believe) Germany that loses an overall sense of pacing. And a surprisingly lengthy ""meanwhile back home"" sequence, with a German professor lecturing about Venus fly traps is flat-out dull, in spite of its metaphors. But other than that, this is an undeniably impressive motion picture from one of the genre's greatest talents. Since the movie is available in several versions, I do feel obligated to briefly comment on them. To put it brief, get a hold of the recent, restored version by Kino International. The movie is given appropriate color tints to suggest day and night (and destroying the error of black-and-white prints in which it was clear that Nosferatu, supposed to be instantly killed by sunlight, is walking around in day without ill effect), and there are none of those added sound effects like crows cawing or doors creaking. There is one version that used these to the hilt and rendered some of the film's best moments unbearable. I'm sure there are some silent filmmaker who would have tossed in these kitschy additions to 'enhance' their movies had the technology been available to them at the time, but I doubt F.W. Murnau would have been one of them.",Nosferatu
102,baumer,Perhaps the first horror movie ever made?,7,2 July 1999,"When I think of horror films from my era, the good ones are films like Angel Heart, Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street.  They all used tecniques to scare like shadows, great lighting, dark images and a truly scary villain. And I must admit that while I am not a true fan of classic cinema ( I absolutely despised Citizen Kane ) I have to say that maybe some of the best horror films from our times have Nosferatu to thank.  The use of shadows and imagery in this film is quite impressive.  And seeing that it is a silent film the atmosphere has to be that much better to achieve its desired mood. And it does that here.  I first saw this film in my first year film studies class at Carleton U.  I had heard all the broohaha about it and it didn't disappoint.  It sent chills through me and that is what I admired about it. Yes, it is dated and that is why older films don't have the same effect on me as modern ones, but this one holds up quite well to films in our time. If you ever come across a copy of this, take a chance on it.  You may see some Carpenter, some Craven and even some Hitchcock in here.  And it will surprise you.",Nosferatu
103,gizmomogwai,Nosferatu still has bite,8,16 October 2009,"I finally managed to upload a copy of the classic German film Nosferatu (1922) intending to review it along with other horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV this October. Among those interested in vampires, Nosferatu has a towering reputation. The movie also established that daylight kills vampires. Nosferatu is basically a rip-off of the novel Dracula, with the names changed. However, I watched an English language version where the names from the novel were restored- for example, Count Orlok was called Count Dracula in the version I watched. Hence I will use the names from the novel in this review.Being from 1922, Nosferatu is of course a silent film; I believe this is only the second silent film I've seen after Birth of a Nation (1915). Despite the handicap of being mute, silent films can convey an effective message anyway. I knew just from watching the beginning that Renfield was crazy and had a creepy laugh. Furthermore, when Renfield sends Harker to Dracula's castle, you can see Harker, formerly a sceptic regarding warnings from the superstitious peasants, beginning to freak out. The appearance of Dracula is now famous- a rotting corpse, not a man. People praise the actor, Max Schreck, but personally I see this as more of a triumph in make-up than in acting.I found myself not understanding a few things in the movie- like how Dracula got control of Renfield to begin with. Another disappointment is that with a run time of only an hour and twenty-four minutes, and with Dracula not getting to Germany until fifty-seven minutes into the film, he's not going to be able to do much there. We see little of his terrorizing of Germany, until a strategy to kill him is conveniently found in a book, and he's vapourized by the morning sun. Still, Nosferatu is a landmark in vampire history, marking the start of their long lived presence in movies. It's still a fun film, and still an influence.Happy Halloween.",Nosferatu
104,marcin_kukuczka,"Horror masterpiece which, after all these years, is even more enjoyable",9,29 October 2006,"F.W. Murnau indeed has a significant place in movie history. He was the director who invented camera movement in his wonderful 1924 production THE LAST LAUGH. He is also known for having directed one of the most beautiful silent romances, THE SUNRISE (1927). Besides, it is maestro F.W. Murnau who adapted Goethe's marvelous FAUST to screen in 1926. Finally, it is him who, not having any serious reference to how a horror film was being made, proved unbelievable brilliant uniqueness of thrill through the still classic horror, constantly a prospect film for all scary movies, NOSFERATU. We have a number of horrors nowadays... yet, NOSFERATU is still enjoyed by viewers galore... is that not an interesting phenomenon? Of course, the period of time which has passed since the premiere of the film is huge and, as a result, there may be some people who will dislike the movie after all these years: no camera movement, silent performances which tend to constitute ""overacting"" with ""overgesticulation"" (from today's perspective), undeveloped cinematography. Nevertheless, I think that because of the movie's old age, it has a stronger sense of suspicion and mystery nowadays than it used to have decades ago. I still absolutely admire this film for its constant power to thrill and shock while the awareness that the movie is more than 80 years old additionally thrills me. Modern horrors are, generally, so unoriginal and similar in their conventions that there is still no movie that could be compared to Murnau's 1922 masterpiece. How come that a movie made in the early 1920s with limited filming techniques can thrill the 21 century viewers? This leads me to one conclusion: Murnau's film really served its purpose to the very core.The number of scary moments are something the film can still boast. Who can forget Hutter's visit to Graf Orlok's castle? Who can skip the facial expression of the vampire from the coffin? Who can possibly omit the terrific atmosphere when Nosferatu is on ship? And the moments with mosquitoes... I personally loved many of these scenes, but particularly two sequences have remained in my memory for good: the one at the castle filmed at marvelous Orava in Slovakia and the final one when Nosferatu's shadow is seen walking upstairs.The performances are exceptionally good, yet on the condition that they are interpreted from the silent era's point of view. This is the only factor that may disappoint some today's viewers. Yet, the facial expressions and gesticulations (these are the major factors that one may take into account when applied to silents) still do the job. Max Schreck is still horrifying as Count Orlok. Consider his face, for instance, at the scene when he says about the throat of Hutter's wife. Greta Schroeder is also memorable as Ellen, particularly at the moments of her trances. Alexander Granach in his portrayal of Knock also provides a viewer with a thrill of fear.NOSFERATU is a very well made horror movie, a silent I would recommend to everyone who likes scary movies. I also consider the movie a must see for all movie fans. Highly recommended movie with unforgettable atmosphere that has become even more intense due to the fact the movie was made such a long time ago. I love it and although I have seen it a considerable number of times, I am going to see it once again.",Nosferatu
105,Beta_Gallinger,A silent horror classic!,9,26 June 2007,"I remember seeing this unauthorized 1922 adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, ""Dracula"" (or at least some of it) years ago, but at that point, I was only around nine years old, and it wouldn't have meant much to me at all. However, over a decade later, I watched the entire film, and even though it was my first time ever sitting down on my own to watch a silent movie, meaning that I wasn't exactly used to watching films from this era, I was still VERY impressed with this particular one! Jonathon Harker is a resident in the town of Bremen in 1838, where he lives with his wife, Nina. For a living, he works as a real estate agent. One day, Harker is sent by his strange employer, R.M. Renfield, on a long journey to the Carpathian Mountains, where he is to complete a sale with the mysterious Count Orlok, who has sent a letter showing interest in purchasing a house in Bremen. On Harker's way to Count Orlok's castle, he comes to a nearby inn. Here, he looks in a book called ""The Book of the Vampires"", but does not believe any of the frightening things it says. However, after Harker reaches his destination, he eventually learns the horrifying truth about Count Orlok, and much trouble lies ahead for Harker, his wife, and the whole town of Bremen! It has now been more than eight decades since the release of ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"" (a.k.a. ""Nosferatu""). Some movies from this long ago haven't aged very well as time has gone by, but ""Nosferatu"" is clearly one that has! For today's viewers, it can still be very scary (as horror movies are supposed to be) and highly entertaining for fans of the horror genre! So, if you're into horror flicks, then unless you simply dislike films from the silent era in general, I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this groundbreaking 1922 classic!",Nosferatu
106,jhclues,"Max Schreck IS ""Nosferatu""",10,18 March 2001,"In 1921, director F.W. Murnau set out to make a horror film based on Bram Stoker's novel, `Dracula,' but was denied the rights to the property by Stoker's estate.  Undeterred, however, Murnau merely changed the title to `Nosferatu,' the name of the title character to `Count Orlok,' then proceeded to make what has come to be considered nothing less than a classic of the silent film era.  An unsettling film (especially for the times in which it was made), it is a faithful adaptation of Stoker's story, and brings images to the screen, the likes of which at the time, had never before been seen.  And although by today's standards much of it may seem relatively tame, there is an innate sense of the sinister about it that is timeless.  For the same elements that so unnerved audiences in 1922 when it was released, are equally discomfiting now, most of which is courtesy of Max Schreck, who portrayed Count Orlok. 	It was the first screen appearance for what is now the most famous vampire in history, and the German character actor Schreck brought an eerie presence to the role that has never been equaled.  Bela Lugosi may be considered the definitive Dracula-- his portrayal is certainly the most well known-- but even he could not match the sense of evil that Schreck brought to the character.  The scene in which Schreck's shadow is cast on the wall as he slowly negotiates a staircase, emphasizing his misshapen head and elongated fingers and nails, is an image that leaves an indelible impression on the memory, as does Schreck's overall appearance:  Lanky, though slightly stooped, with oversized, pointed ears and haunted, sunken eyes.  It was Schreck's greatest screen role, and had it not been for a lawsuit by Stoker's estate that prevented wide distribution of the film, it would no doubt have made him a star. 	The supporting cast includes John gottowt, Alexander Granach, Wolfgang Heinz, Max Nemetz, Gustav von Wangenheim, Ruth Landshoff and Greta Schroder. An air of mystery surrounded the set during the filming of `Nosferatu' that became something of a myth, which began with the fact that Schreck, a method actor, was never seen by cast nor crew without his makeup and in character. And it was further perpetuated when it may have been implied by Murnau that Schreck was actually a vampire playing an actor playing a vampire, all of which goes a long way toward proving that `hype' is nothing new to the entertainment industry.  One of the three most highly regarded German directors of the times, Murnau, whose philosophy was that `nothing existed beyond the frame,' directed a number of films, but none achieved the lasting notoriety of `Nosferatu.'  For film buffs everywhere, as well as aficionados of silent pictures, this film is a must-see, and a perfect companion piece to the recently released (2000) `Shadow of the Vampire,' the film by E. Elias Merhige that chronicles the making of `Nosferatu.'  A comparatively short film-- the restored DVD version runs 81 minutes, the video, 63 minutes-- it will nevertheless provide an entertaining and memorable cinematic experience.  This is an example of not only the magic, but the magic at the very core of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",Nosferatu
107,KnightsofNi11,Where the vampire genre all began,8,29 October 2011,"This is where the long legacy of Dracula films begins. F.W. Murnau's classic, Nosferatu, is said to be one of the most terrifying adaptations of Bram Stoker's novel ever made. It is a silent film German from 1922, not released in the states until 1929 because it was rumoured to be some sort of German propaganda, not something the United States wanted floating around the country in the midst of World War I. Of course, the film is nothing of the sort. It tells the story of Hutter, a real estate agent who visits the Campire Count Orlok's castle in Transylvania after Orlok expresses interest in taking up residence near Hutter. Hutter quickly learns that the Count has a dark secret, and so unfolds a tale of terror as Count Orlok wreaks havoc on Hutter's unsuspecting home town.By 1922's standards this film is absolutely horrific and incredibly dark. By the standards of the 21st century it's hard to still see this film as frightening, but it is indeed still dark. It tells a bleak tale, one of sorrow and misery, without anything to lighten the mood. It begins cheerily enough. Hutter and his wife live a peaceful existence in their town. They are deeply in love and they have a substantial income to make their lives as easygoing as possible. But things take a turn for the worst as soon as Hutter agrees to visit the dangerous Count Orlok. The film only grows colder and darker from there, never shedding a hopeful light on the harrowing situation the characters of this film find themselves in. Even towards the end when the film seems like it might end happily, it takes a dark twist that ends it on a very somber and unfortunate note. This is truly astounding for a film made so long ago.I said that this film isn't very scary by our standards anymore, but that doesn't mean that the image of Count Orlok isn't disturbingly memorable. The images of Orlok as the full fledge vampire, Nosferatu, are deeply unsettling and he is a figure that you cannot easily shake from your mind. The make up is excellent and the hauntingly slow paced way Max Schreck portrays the Count is perfect. He is an incredibly ominous figure, standing up at least six feet tall, dressed in a powerful black robe that contradicts his eerily pale skin. Schreck also wears giant prosthetic hands which are half human half beast, in a way. They are massive hands with claw like structures on the fingers, and when Schreck stretches these hands out it makes Nosferatu that much more feared and all the more intimidating. Nosferatu's image is something that should be revered forever in the world of vampires.And what a vast world that is. Vampires have been falling in and out of popular culture ever since this film. We now have countless vampire movies, plenty of vampire book series, and even a plethora of vampire television shows. And what's amazing to think is that this 80 minute German film from 1922 is what started this entire legacy, other than the book it is based on of course. Any visual rendition of the Dracula story and any film or television show centered around vampires owes so much to Nosferatu, much more than they are likely aware of. Vampires are practically their own genre these days, and its all thanks to this film. Nosferatu spawned a legacy that, just like the film's title character, will likely never die.",Nosferatu

109,RforFilm,"See how Nosferatu, the oldest of horror movies still has fangs.",10,9 June 2014,"Out of each genre that has experimented with it, black and white photography seems to have been used better in horror. And it's ironic considering that a lot of amateur filmmakers want to make the next big scary movie, and almost all are shot in traditional color. Though simplistic, black and white photography in horror cinema to me is like the ultimate battle of light and darkness. The light representing the good and peace of mankind and the black revealing the darkest of shadows and the true tone of eclipsed mystery. The world's that are already bleak, suddenly takes a turn when the movie is done in a German Expressionistic style.Believe it or not, if you've seen any Tim Burton film (Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Frankenweenie, etc) then you have an idea what German Expressionism is about; looking at the ideas of madness and insanity in a more visual style. Dark shadows fill with terror and abstract visuals are welcomed. Speaking of Germany, this country has given the world a lot of interesting stories from the dystopian future of Metropolis to the eerie tone of Cabinet of Doctor Caligari. But I'm here today to examine it's view on vampires in Nosferatu.This is actually an interesting retelling of Dracula. Apparently, the studio could not obtain the rights to produce the Bram Stocker novel, so they took the same formula, and changed the names in an attempt to make it their own.It opens with lawyer Thomas Hutter who is being sent to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok. He bids farewell to his fiancé Ellen and entrusts his friends Harding, and Harding's sister Annie to look after her. Close to his destination, he comes to an Inn where he is warned by villagers to not go to the Orlok's castle at night.He arrives to find Count Orlok (played by Max Schreck) to be a thin, almost terrifying man to look at. He continues his assignment, aside from the strange occurrences from puncture marks on his neck to Orlok almost sucking the blood from his thumb. Orlok signs the documents to buy the house across from Hutter as the lawyer starts to suspect that Orlok may be Nosferatu, ""The Bird of Death"". Hutter escapes, but Nosferatu ends up shipping his body out in the seas where he continues to attack each sailor one by one. He eventually reaches Hutter's town, as the young man must race to save his fiancé.If a silent movie should be watched around Halloween, then Nosferatu is the best answer. Though not as recognized as the Bela Lugosi Dracula, this vampire story is just as atmospheric and a tad creepier. The German Expressionistic tone only makes the scenario scarier and Max Schreck becomes one with the matching scenery as the chilling Count Orlok. I remember watching this for the first time when I was a freshman in college, and this gave me fighting dreams for two days. I can still see that demonic creature whenever I close my eyes.As silent movies go, this is one of the best ones (certainly best of the horror silent). I have yet to see the Lon Chaney Phantom of the Opera or Hunchback of Notre Dame, so I can't make too much of a comparison. But I will say that these images are the ones that inspired men like Tim Burton to continue to show new light on this kind of expressionism. It's played in many film classes for a good reason; it's the grandfather of horror. Nosferatu probably won't sway modern movie goers, but this is a must for any fan of horror or Tim Burton.I'll give this ten shadows of Count Orlok out of ten. As dark as the castle that it sits in, Nosferatu is a bleak, but beautifully crafted tale of Dracula is in the National Film Registry for a reason. See why this old film is worth preserving.",Nosferatu
110,stamper,"Why this is still a classic, even eight decades later",8,26 March 2004,"The thing with Nosferatu is, that despite the fact that there is no spoken dialog, the film is able to maintain a pretty high level of entertainment throughout. This is mainly achieved by Murnau's sharp style of directing, which only portrays the essential parts of the story and the great music by Erdmann. Another thing that makes this film worth while, is the fact that Murnau is able to put some special effects' into the film, which do not only make the film more interesting, but also astonishing, if one bears in mind that it was shot in 1922. I, for one cannot comment too much on the acting, but as far as I'm concerned, it was good as well and putting all elements together I'd have to say that Nosferatu is one tight package of silent film-making. Now I know that this film will not be for everybody, but if you are a film buff and you enjoy a good thrill, you should give this film a shot (that is if you do not oppose watching a silent film).

Mernau has created a classic with Max Shreck as the mysterious Count Orlock. See this movie. I recommend it to everyone. This is a towering masterpiece of horror.....5/5.",Nosferatu

I must admit, though, that I preferred the first half. It is magical in some way when Hutter is going to Transylvania. Murnau is a master at building up the tension. The DVD copy I got had a very good musical score by the Silent Orchestra. As for Max Schreck's performance, it was very good. But I've got to say that I still prefer Lugosi's sublime performance in ""Dracula"".

114,tonypeacock-1,"Early, eerie 1922 horror film as haunting as any Dracula adaptation",6,13 July 2019,"Silent, black and white film from 1922. German production to boot.
Inspired by a source material of the Bram Stoker story, Dracula.In order to evade possible copyright infringement issues with the Stoker estate key character names from Dracula were changed and the locations changed from London to Bremen, Germany.Of course these changes failed to persuade the courts, who ordered that prints of this film be destroyed. Some luckily survived!Directed by F.W. Murnau. The film has gained cult like status amongst the silent film fan community.I watched the Werner Herzog 1979 remake first a few days ago. I'm glad I watched in that order because it allowed me to understand the original so much more.What makes this film stand out as one of the first horror movies is the performance of main star Max Schreck as Count Orlok (Dracula). He has the appearance of a rodent rat.No wonder Orlok strikes fear into the local population of his isolated castle in the Carpathian mountains.The film ticks along with haunting photography even by 1922 standards and the obligatory cue cards.The character of Count Orlok is a lasting memory of the 94 minute long film.",Nosferatu
115,springfieldrental,First Vampire Movie,9,3 November 2021,"Bram Stoker's 1897 book 'Dracula' wasn't the first written work on vampires, but it was the first one to capture the imagination of the public. Hollywood didn't touch the subject of vampires before German artist, architect and occultist Albin Grau was inspired while serving in World War One by a Serbian farmer's story of his father being a vampire and one of the Undead. He and a businessman formed the film studio, Prana Film, to produce a movie based on Stoker's book. Even though a lost and obscure Hungarian film may have beaten Grau to the punch by a year, his March 1922's ""Nosferatu"" is acknowledged as cinema's first on a vampire and on Count Dracula.Grau was responsible for the look and feel of ""Nosferatu."" He hired writer Henrik Galeen, who was involved in 1913 'The Student of Prague' and wrote the screenplay to 1920's ""Golem,' to draw up the script for ""Nosferatu,"" based on the Dracula book despite not buying the movie rights from the late author's widow, Florence Stoker and his estate. Grau also employed director F. W. Murnau to carry out his vision. Murnau not only displayed a keen eye on presenting one of Germany's most expressionist film, but lent his suggestions to the Galeen script. And it was the movie that put the spotlight on Murnau as one of Germany's emerging talented directors.Another key element to the aura of ""Nosferatu"" was the actor who played the vampire count, Max Schreck, a stage actor who had been in front of a camera only two times before. His portrayal of a blood-sucking creep was so believable that the 2000 film on the making of ""Nosferatu,"" 'Shadow of the Vampire,' has the actor, played by Willem Dafoe, being an actual vampire.Because he felt his small film company couldn't afford to buy the rights to 'Dracula,' Grau decided to change some of the plot lines and characters of the Stoker novel. The movie's title was linked to a Transylvanian term, Nesuferitu, meaning an unclean spirit. Count Dracula's name was altered to Count Orlok, who resembles more of a rat than the suave Stoker noble, and who kills his victims rather than creates more vampires. The locations and the year the events took place, 1838, were also shifted around. Religious symbols and garlic have no effect on ""Nosferatu's"" vampire, but there's a twist where, while the sunlight for Dracula only weakens him, for Orlok it's a lot stronger.But all the changes didn't fool Florence. She had no idea about the production of ""Nosferatu"" until she received an anonymous letter at her residence in London detailing the film's screening in Germany and included a handbill describing the movie as ""freely adapted from Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Not living in the lap of luxury, Florence sued the German film studio for copyright infringement and demanded payment as well all copies of the film destroyed. By 1925 when the courts made their final decision, Grau's studio was bankrupt (""Nosferatu"" was it's only movie produced) and despite numerous prints destroyed, a small number had been preserved, to be shown a few years later, enveloped by a cult following.When Hollywood did come around to produce its 1931 'Dracula' with Bela Lugosi, Universal Pictures paid Florence $40,000 for the rights to her husband's novel.",Nosferatu
116,ofpsmith,Scarier than Dracula,8,31 October 2015,"I'm just going to start by saying, this is a scarier movie than the 1931 Dracula. I think Dracula is a better movie but in terms of fear, Nosferatu just edges out. Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula is excellent, but he played Dracula like a charming nobleman. Lugosi was even wearing a tuxedo. But Max Schreck as Count Orlok was much scarier. He was taller than Lugosi, he was bald, he had those ugly hands, and was just downright terrifying and ugly. Lugosi never really bothered me, but Schreck actually gave me the creeps and made me cringe. Orlok is even an uglier name than Dracula. The German cinematography is also creepy and it really works. It's a perfect Halloween movie.",Nosferatu
117,DarthVoorhees,Brilliant,10,20 June 2005,"F.W Murnau made a movie that has and will stand the test of time.Nosferatu is still at times frightening.The film has an eerie feel which is made greater by being in black and white.When getting a copy of Nosferatu look into who is doing the music,I personally prefer organ music.The acting is great too.Gustav Von Wangenheim goes a bit over board with his facial expressions at times,but we can forgive him.The thing that pulls the audiences back and back again is of course Max Scherk who gives the uncanny performance as the evil Count Orlock.If you look into the eyes of Scherk as Orlock you all most see fear it's self.We can understand why a movie like Shadow of the Vampire was made.The movie faithfully follows the Stoker novel unlike the Lugosi version which followed the Broadway play.There were name changes to avoid legal trouble with Stoker's widow.That is why Harker is now Hutter,Mina is now Ellen,and Dracula is now Orlock.This is nothing to be upset over because the film is still I think one of the most faithful adaption of Stoker's novel.I am sure that Nosferatu will haunt audiences for years to come.",Nosferatu
118,the red duchess,One of the great celebrations/critiques of cinema.,10,22 March 2001,"'Nosferatu' opens with a man looking at his reflection in a mirror.  Besides its symbolic significance, this is a perfect distillation of his character, that of a vain, narcissistic, absurdly self-confident to the point of machismo, married man largely indifferent to a wife he abruptly leaves to make the fortune worthy of a man of his merits.  He ain't afraid of no ghosts, nor robbers.  So, the image he sees in that mirror is one of wholeness, perfection - I am Hutter, I command all I see, my unity of identity is linked to my power in body.  To the viewer, however, the effect is the precise opposite.  The framing of the scene is fragmented, with the outer frame, the window and the mirror; Hutter himself is doubled - the 'real' Hutter and his reflection, or shadow. All the assumptions smilingly embodied in Hutter will thus be destroyed in conventional horror terms.  His whole identity will be destroyed - the Count will suck his blood and in effect become him, if we believe the man who claims 'blood is life'. Hutter's body will first become passive, feminised as he is violated by the Count; after, he will no longer be a body, but a shadow, bloodless - literally, he shadows the Count as the latter comes to England; and symbolically, in that two men now claim possession of Hutter's wife, and both have equal claim, both being Hutter.  Murnau is careful to give his horror story a genuine patina as an 'objective' story: no horror film has come as close to capturing the visual essence of all those stories that have circulated in Europe for centuries, the twisting medieval towns, the arcane religious symbolism, the plagues and mass hysteria, the crumbling castles and storm-tossed ships, the creak of wood - the look of the film feels like a crumpling manuscript setting out the story.  But the film is also the portrait of a marriage.  The opening sequence chillingly reveals the sterility of a marriage before anyone has even heard of the Count - Hutter wrapped up in himself; Ellen, hypersensitive, morbid, dressed as if in mourning; the union childless; the couple, above all, separate, each completely misunderstanding the other. 
The image of the mirror is repeated throughout the film, connecting Hutter to the Count - the scene in Knock's office where Hutter looks at the map of Transylvania just as he did his mirror; the Count's house directly opposite Hutter's, a decaying edifice that looks like a melting, anguished face. 
But Ellen is linked to the Count too, her somnolent rising mirroring his. This isn't a conventional opposition between bourgeois and bestial urges, even though the Count is given the most grotesque (anti-Semitic?) animal features, and even though Murnau never lets us forget the Conut as emanation of the Hutters' dreams, desires and fears - Hutter reads that he will shadow his dreams; Ellen spends most of the film sleepwalking. 
All three elements of this triangle, which symbolises the one relationship, is linked to death - the Count, the undead, living in coffins of dead earth; Hutter, narcissistic, onanistic, his lifeblood siphoned from him; Ellen, the Venus fly-trap, self-abnegating destroyer of the destroying force.  Hutter ends the film as he began, alone, his lust for money and status destroying the union that crowned it.  The contrivance of society and respectability is swept away by the malaise of nature, those gendered forests, tides and moons, as if the Count and Ellen are part of the one female nature Hutter cannot accomodate.Such Freudiana is undermined in the film in two ways - in the disarming comedy of the piece, the Count often seeming to have strayed from a silent comedy, running around London with his coffin; and by a self-reflexive examination of film, that sees the warning about vampires in the book Hutter reads linked to bestiality and the eye that is so important in the film; the turning of the film stock into negative as Hutter enters the Count's realm; the trickery, such as time lapse and fast motion, that shows the Count's mastery of time and space, but, more importantly, Murnau's mastery over the storytelling, already indicated by an unseen, but constantly intruding narrator; even Ellen's couch, which, my husband suggests , seems patterned as strips of film.  In a  movie where human sexuality is impossible, the characters seem content to be voyeurs, like the film audience, staving off the death, the loss of identity, or at least its fragmentation, that contact with another person entails.",Nosferatu
119,davidcarniglia,"""Here Begins the Land of Phantoms""",8,28 September 2018,"The best vampire movie, and one of the best horror movies. Max Shreck seems to actually be a vampire. Almost a hundred years after Nosferatu, his Count Orlock is still the most frightening presence ever on screen.At least one reviewer mentioned that Shreck was a vampire playing a human playing a vampire; I'm remembering a modern movie (sorry, I'm not quick on recalling the title) with just that premise. Even Shreck's shadows are scary. I agree with the review that pointed out the blend of Romantic German influence (the scenic aspects) and the German Expressionist touches (almost every scene with Orlock).Seeing Nosferatu again after many years, the differing motifs are more noticeable, but work well. Definitely Romanticism delved into the bizarre, decrepit, and ghostly; it's the ""phantom"" world mentioned by the Transylvanian native. The Expressionistic interior scenes complement with their claustrophobic, hallucinatory feel. At times, though, the atmosphere doesn't seem supported by the tone projected by some of the characters.Hutter seems an almost comic character, oblivious and even annoying. He's not really sympathetic. After all, his motive for going to Transylvania is completely monetary; he not only leaves his wife in the lurch, but puts her in danger by his affiliation with Orlock. And it's her power that destroys Orlock; her husband is more or less useless, despite all of his hand wringing.The character I had the most trouble with was Knoch. I suppose we're to assume that he's had prior dealings with Orlock. This isn't stated, but it must be so, because he's vampiric himself; he even looks a bit like Orlock. Another clue is that he can read the weird hieroglyphic letter from Orlock. What I didn't understand was why and how he goes back to the asylum after escaping.In one scene, in a field, Knoch he's inexplicably sort of cavorting around. At other times he's simply goofy. I get that he's supposed to be nuts, but it plays like unexpected comic relief. Like Hutter, Knoch subverts the tone without adding much to the story.I like how Ellen lures Orlock to his death. In most vampire lore, the innocent woman is simply prey, and has no intrinsic power over the vampire. It does make sense that Orlock, not being a rational creature, would inadvertently endanger himself for the right amount of lust.It did seem odd that the vampire book that Hutter refers to uses the name Dracula. Maybe Murnau skirted the legal usage of that word by using it only as a reference, and not as a character's name.The period setting was convincing. The clothing styles for both the middle-class and peasant characters was very authentic. The town crier and lamplighter were great touches in the Bremen scenes. What didn't quite add up was that the streets were always deserted when Orlock was moving about with his coffins. Even in the middle of the night you'd think somebody or some thing would be about in a large city.I really had to steel myself to watch Nosferatu again; it's that scary. There's nothing like Shreck standing up in the coffin, rats scurrying all over, as the stunned sailor looks on. I feel kind of traitorous not giving this a '10'; but some bits seemed off in this time around. 8/10.",Nosferatu
120,Bababooe,Nosferatu as a character = 10 stars. Nosferatu as movie = 5 stars,7,27 April 2018,"I've seen this movie a few times. Last time was last week. The story is basically a cut version of Dracula. And the version I saw was butchered American or English version with the characters named Dracula instead of Orlof and so on. I'm sure the story has also been butchered in the editing. Best thing about this film is the character Nosferatu and Max Schreck's portrayal. Unfortunately, there are not enough scenes with him. This character is pure dread. I hope the original version has more and more intense scenes with him.All the other characters and actors are just there, just mediocre. The only other actor/character worth mentioning is Renfield and his story line is not explored much in the version I saw. If you've read the book Dracula, or know the story or seen the other versions of Dracula, my suggestion is to bypass the flaws in this film (the story and most of the acting) and dive right into the main character and scenes with him.

121,elicopperman,The Iconic Film Dracula Before Lugosi,6,20 February 2019,"Before the days of the Dracula films that everyone associates with, there was another feature inspired by the classic novel made during the German expressionist period called Nosferatu. What's interesting to note is that even though the film was inspired by the Bram Stoker book, it had to deviate heavily from the source material due to failure to obtain the rights from Stoker's heirs, and as a result the film suffered numerous legal problems after it was made. With all that said though, for what it is, it still remains revolutionary in the horror movie genre for how innovative it was back then. In terms of how it ages though, I only enjoyed it to a degree.The general storyline focuses on the mysterious Count Orlok summoning Thomas Hutter to let him buy a house in the town of Wisborg, only for Hutter to discover that Orlok is a vampire and must save his wife Ellen, all while Orlok's crazy servant Knock prepares for his master to arrive. I think the weakest aspect of the feature is actually the plot itself, as it's too straight forward to have much surprises (at least nowadays) and the characters themselves are two dimensional at best. Not to mention, the acting is also heavily over the top at times, making some scenes way too hammy to be taken seriously. I do like how the film integrated a subplot of a possible rat plague to create the necessary drama, but at the same time it didn't really need to be there. Having Orlok and Knock being the main epidemic throughout Wisborg would have been more than enough.However, in spite of its numerous flaws, there is still a lot to admire about the feature itself. The usage of dark shadowy lighting and camera tricks help elevate the creepy atmosphere and suspenseful tension that still looks quite impressive to this day. The limitations of silent filmmaking back then are what carry the emotions across visually more than any amount of dialogue ever could. Any given moment where the music gets horrifying is what sends chills down my spine, and its no wonder many shots are parodied and payed homage to in subsequent features to this day. Even if one could argue that movies onward have improved on horror cliches and tropes, the shear artistry and craftsmanship behind the scenes are what give the feature life. Never forget how important color shading and values are to the presentation of any feature out there.So in the end, while Nosferatu is far from a favorite of my personal caliber, I still highly respect it for how inspirational and groundbreaking it is. It's no wonder the film itself got remade by Werner Herzog and why the likes of Stephen King and Bernard J. Taylor have made their own tributes based of it. I would give this a recommendation to anyone who is curious to know what Dracula inspired content was like prior to the feature with Bela Lugosi. You might not appreciate everything about it, but one thing's for certain: it will satisfy anyone who ever wondered what this strange alternative vampire legend was in the first place.",Nosferatu
122,garethcrook,The remakes never match the original due they.,9,15 February 2021,"F.W. Murnau's classic telling of the Dracula legend. Some of the details are a little different from Bram Stoker's book, but only names and places. They'll be some real die hard Dracula fans that can wax on about the myths and meaning of one version over another and what it all means. That's not me though, if you want that, Google it. Here I'm more concerned with how this film looks and feels. The answer to both is, creepy! Shot in the early 20s, it's of course black and white, 4:3, flickery... and silent. The version I've watched had restored title cards for the minimal dialogue. Which is a shame, but didn't detract too much and the scene setters still used the original German hand drawn black letters which really add to the tone. Essentially it's the well known story. A rich vampiric Count from Transylvania wants to buy a new home and a young naive estate agent goes to flog him one in his hometown of Bremen, having left behind his young and quite justifiably worried wife. So Hutter (the agent) leaves his wife with friends, travels the long and arduous journey to ""the land of spectres"". This is what it's about really isn't it. The story is great and this does rattle on bloody fast, but it's Max Schreck's depiction of Count Orlok 'Nosferatu' that's why this still kicks ass 100 years on. The locals are terrified of him, try to warn Hutter (Gustav Von Wangenheim), but he's having none of it. Hahaha he laughs on screen, all actions emphasised for the lack of sound. Even in Act 1 as we're waiting to reach Orlok's castle, the cut is lovely. You can tell that great care and attention has been taken to ensure the story flows and it does with a remarkable silkiness. Sometimes films of this era can seem a little disjointed, but this is a masterclass. There's some gorgeous cinematography that packs a punch even in black and white, probably more so in fact. Although it'd be lovely to see what they'd have done had the Academy ratio been an option. Filmed in Slovakia and Germany, it looks authentically rural and again, creepy. Hunters eyes are on stalks from his first encounters with the Count, as great as Schreck is, Wangenheim really does carry his share of the load. Orlok sees a photo of Hutters wife, declares ""Your wife has a lovely neck"" and signs the papers to buy the house close to his. Hutter starts to get a little concerned, does he really want this dude as his neighbour. Even from afar he seems to have a hold over Hutter's wife, who senses her husband's danger. It's fantastic, as Orloks stalks menacingly through scenes, doors obeying his movements. It's a scary as anything you'll see in modern cinema, with nothing but a bit of make up, a lot of tension and some wonderful score that signposts every move. Hutter discovers his hosts secret, realises he's in trouble, he's not laughing now, Ellen is in danger, as Orlok boards a ship with his coffins full of earth and rats. It's gripping stuff, much better than that offering from the 90s with the dodgy accents, even if Gary Oldman looked amazing, he's no where near as iconic as Schreck. Orlok moves in to his new abode, which looks like a disused warehouse in Manchester awaiting gentrification. The locals panic at the finding of his seemingly abandoned ship, fearing the Plague. With nothing else for it, Ellen offers herself to save the town, missing none of the romance in this fantasy horror. It's magnificent and certainly one of the best pieces of early cinema I've seen.",Nosferatu
123,nickenchuggets,Blood is life,10,27 October 2021,"Because this movie turns 100 next year, I feel I simply have to discuss it. Nosferatu is one of the greatest and most well known of the countless vampire movies, with legitimately creepy Max Schreck playing the main character, Count Orlok. Although it is based on Bram Stoker's most famous book Dracula, Nosferatu forgoes some important aspects of the story and invents its own plot points. The backstory of the movie is almost as interesting as the movie itself, since Stoker's family apparently tried to sue director FW Murnau over this so called ""unlicensed adaptation."" At first, it looked like they succeeded, and a judge wanted all copies of the movie burned. Most were, but a very small amount managed to remain unharmed, and that is why we are able to watch this masterpiece today. It's just strange to imagine if things turned out differently and Stoker's family got their way, nobody would know about this movie. Anyway, as stated before, Nosferatu makes several changes to Stoker's book, and Dracula isn't even in the movie. It also takes place in germany in the 1830s, before germany was even a unified nation. The tale begins in a german town named Wisborg, where Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) travels to the infamous Hungarian/Romanian region of Transylvania, which is well known today for apparently being host to many vampires. He is here to see Count Orlok, who he doesn't recognize as a vampire yet. Orlok buys a house close to Hutter's, and the townsfolk seem to know all about Orlok already, as they are terrified of him. After this, Hutter journeys to a castle (which Orlok owns) and stays for the night. Upon awakening, he finds two marks on his neck which resemble insect bites. After reading about vampires in a book, Hutter starts to believe that Orlok's strange behavior toward him at the castle can be chalked up to the fact that he is one. Hutter's wife Ellen also starts behaving strangely which suggests Orlok is controlling her somehow. Soon, Orlok's coffin (with him inside) is transported to a cargo ship, where he wakes up and slaughters the crew. The ship arrives back in Wisborg, which enables Orlok to enter his new house he bought earlier. Pretty much immediately, people in Wisborg begin dying, but people think it's because of a disease at first. Although vampirism is a disease, nobody suspects this yet. Meanwhile, Ellen learns from the book her husband was reading that a vampire can be killed if a mortal woman (like her) tries to seduce him. However, this partially backfires when Orlok feeds on her, but he picked a bad time to do so. The dawn sunlight approaches, and Orlok can't survive this. He disappears, but Ellen dies right after. Like I said earlier, Nosferatu makes some noticeable changes from the book on which it is based, probably the most dramatic of which is the change in setting. It was felt that germany would make for a better setting than Britain, where the original was set. Another difference is how Orlok does not turn other people into vampires in the film, although being bitten by one typically implies this. I never read the book so I don't know how it ends, but Nosferatu's ending is also changed because it's revealed that sunlight kills him, as opposed to Dracula who is only damaged by the sun. There was also a remake of this movie by Werner Herzog in the 1970s which changes the main villain back to Count Dracula, but there's a reason the 20s version remains the most famous. While it may not be as disturbing now as it was back then, Nosferatu as a character is still pretty creepy, due to the immense height of Max Schreck, who plays him. The frame of him standing in the open doorway is still disturbing after a whole century. In my opinion, Nosferatu will always be remembered as long as horror movies exist, because without it, vampire movies would probably be much different. Simply an automatic 10/10.",Nosferatu

It's Dracula, like he has almost never been after this, it might say Count Orlok, but it's Dracula.. the only reason it does not say that, is due to copyright issues. This Dracula is perhaps not sexy or stylized and cool, but he is scary!

125,moviemanMA,The Origin of Horror,10,24 July 2005,"What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it can't be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter doesn't know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it's still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he's just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.",Nosferatu
126,rdoyle29,The first Dracula ...,9,17 September 2000,"Subtitled ""A Symphony of Horror"", ""Nosferatu"" is the first, and on of the best, of many movies inspired by Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"".  Directed by one of the cinema's true poets, who helped create the language of the horror movie, it is a dreamlike film where much is left unexplained.  The geography is deliberately vague, and several characters, such as the Van Helsing figure, Professor Bulwer, have little connection with the main action.  From the start there is a sense of unease and menace, but everything is done by suggestion without any explicit violence.  Blood is constantly mentioned but never seen.  Plague overtakes a city but we are left to imagine the state of its victims.  When the townspeople chase Knock over the countryside they appear to be tearing him apart, but the object of their frenzy turns out to be a scarecrow.The film's climax has a gentle sensuality.  Instead of a phallic stake being driven through the vampire's heart, a self-sacrificing heroine holds him in her bed to ensure his death.  Sex and death, blood and contamination, are the film's themes.  Max Shreck's Orlok is a truly grotesque iconic figure, both frightening and moving, with his bat ears, his aquiline nose, hunched shoulders, hairless dome, flaring eyebrows, black-ringed eyes, white skin, and clawlike hands.",Nosferatu

Can not help but start praising the job Max Schreck and Murnau did to bring Count Orlok character to life on the screen. Orlok's face, hands and slender build along with his sly shuffling movements with the right camera angles and props brought a hell of a lot of general creepiness. The viewers in the twenties must have been shell shocked because they didn't tame it down which they most often did in this time period. For a full length silent feature film I found the time going fairly fast with a view dragged out scenes, that can be expected.

While still in a form of relative infancy in 1922, F.W. Murnau takes another stab at establishing cinema's darker side in the form of Nosferatu, a film which never quite pushes the boat out as far as Wiene did two years prior but nevertheless makes a haunting and memorable experience on its own ground.As far as vampire stories, legends and big-screen productions go, Murnau's classic film is one that may not frighten quite as much as it might have done but nevertheless still manages to startle with its beautiful photography and otherworldly performances, all the while pushing you unknowingly into an unsettling atmosphere that envelops the imagination during its strongest sequences. Max Schreck—who will perhaps always be most vividly remembered for his portrayal as Count Graf Orlok here more than anything else—may not be as commanding or entertaining to watch as John Barrymore was a year earlier in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but there are more than a handful of moments where even now almost a century later, Shreck's dead-eyed gaze and stilted, robotic movements are unsettling and haunting to watch.Where the film tends to suffer is during its middle-half where a lengthy boat ride goes awry. Set largely during the day and lacking the eerie claustrophobic sets that dominate the first and last half- hours, these scenes don't have quite the same amount of grip and only sporadically play with or develop the sense of tension and suspense instilled earlier on. Nevertheless, there's still plenty to take away from the experience as a whole, whether seen for historical, aesthetical or purely entertainment reasons. The film's greatest parts, which are set mostly during the dark hours and feature haunting photography bringing to life a thrillingly dark narrative, would go on to further develop the horror genre into its heydays of the 30s and burn images of horror into the minds of its audiences for decades to come. Today, it's not quite as horrifying, but there's an artistry and distinctly unsettling atmosphere throughout that even the ensuing decades since haven't managed to soften.",Nosferatu
130,OttoVonB,A Genre is Born,9,5 September 2002,"Even the most illiterate film-goer would feel a sense of familiarity at a glimpse of Max Schreck's Count Orlock. That in a nutshell sums up how essential and influential this film has become.A half-disguised adaptation of Bram Stocker's Dracula, with names and locations altered for legal reasons, Murnau's Nosferatu is the granddaddy of all vampire films and, to this day, one of the very best and most disturbing. Minimalist and eerie cinematography, a simple yet efficient structure and a horrific title character design make this more than merely enduring. Forget Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee or even Gary Oldman: Max Schreck's rodent-like, unclean horror is the ultimate vampire. this character alone propelled the film into legend and is what nightmares are made of. Only Klaus Kinski ever came close in what was, tellingly, an intriguing remake of this film.This is a recommended starting point if you are new to silent films. It may not be as accessible as Metropolis or visually stunning as The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, but it amply deserves its reputation, if only for continuing to evoke fear and unease 84 years after it was first released.",Nosferatu
131,AnonymousbutDilpreet002,Somebody said scary ?,4,28 July 2020,"That was a laughably silly film. Despite having intertitles, story is so confusing. It's like the Dracula is running from place to another for no proper reason, scaring people. And what was up with that guy locked in jail. Why we see him so many times.The introduction part was uselessly put there, just a formality before actual story starts. Without moving into the story, they have wasted 20 minutes.The face of vampire is funny rather than scary. His shadow was the only scary thing about the whole film. And that dialogue, ""Is that your wife. Such a lovely neck"", was he trying to do comedy. This can not be serious, right?Don't know why people lie to themselves. Calling a hundred years old film a masterpiece is stupidity at best. I have watched many better films from the same era.",Nosferatu

Also this movie is considered to be one of the milestones in movie history. So I had some expectations. But personally I find it very hard to get immersed into silent films and unfortunatly this one was no different. I'm pretty sure i would absolutely love it if i could go back in time and watch this in the 1920's. But right now its just not doing anything for me. It's about a guy going to visit Count Orlok in his mysterious castle to sell him a house in the city but ends up putting his wife and the city in danger.,Nosferatu
133,x_manicure_x,Has its moments,5,14 August 2021,"Murnau's unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" might deserve its status as one of the most seminal contributions to horror cinema, but almost one hundred years later it's nothing more than a slow silent film with a trivial plot, remembered by most for Max Schreck's iconic performance as Count Orlok and a bunch of visually appealing scenes. Just think of the scenes on the schooner, when he stares at you from his window, or when his shadow is seen creeping up the stairs and taking Ellen's heart. Though my favorite shot is definitely when we can barely see his head in the corner of the screen as he quietly drinks her blood. There is a fascinating, eerie atmosphere during Orlok's ""night"" sequences, juxtaposed to the more conventional and dull ""day"" sequences. Murnau used tinted film to distinguish the two domains and added a few proto-special effects like negative shots, fast-forward, and superimposition to suggest Orlok's monstrous nature.Must-watch if you are into cinema history or want to know where a lot of vampire horror clichés came from, otherwise you are not missing anything.",Nosferatu
134,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Simply Fantastic,9,28 October 2006,"SPOILERSThis is by far my favorite silent film. It was just plain creepy without sound! That's pretty impressive, right? When I was young I was absolutely terrified of Count Orlock. I mean, whenever he came on the television for some commercial I would scream and run. Now, I think he's a brilliant character.Count Orlock is the first Dracula character to come to the big screen along with the first vampire movie ever in 1922. That was nine years before Bela Lugosi in the 1931 Dracula.You all should know the plot to this, so I won't bore you with my speech about the movie's plot. I mean, it is basically Dracula. Anyway, there are hundreds of famous scenes in this film. Here are a few.Jonathan meets Count Orlock with a little hat.Count Orlock in the doorway.Count Orlock in the coffin.Count Orlock's shadow while walking up the stairs.Count Orlock dies.Have you ever noticed that Lemony Snicket's Count Olaf sounds very similar to Count Orlock? That's where Lemony Snicket got his inspiration for Count Olaf.Count Orlock definitely does not the good looks like Bela Lugosi, which looks more like the real Dracula in Bram Stroker's novel. Count Orlock has the head of a rat, and a slight hunchback, and a black suit, and in the beginning of the movie, a little hat.If you're a fan of horror films, pick this sixty-eight minute flick up at Hollywood Video or Blockbuster.9/10 Recommended Films: Dracula, Bram Stroker's Dracula, and Taste the Blood of Dracula.",Nosferatu
135,ReelCheese,In The Minority,5,29 July 2006,"Obviously any reviewer has to cut this one a lot of slack. It was made in 1922, a time when people were still amazed by the ability of others to project moving images onto a screen. Although films had already been produced for years at this point, there were still plenty of bugs to be worked out in direction, storytelling and plenty of other areas.I kept all of this in mind when watching ""Nosferatu."" Based on the high ratings other IMDb users have given, I'm clearly in the minority when I say I wasn't all that crazy about it. Even with its limitations in mind, it too often drags along at a snail's pace. It's also somewhat episodic, lacking a seamless flow from one scene to the next. And other than a few memorable scenes with Max Shreck's hideous vampire -- truly one of the all-time frightening screen villains -- it's not all that interesting. I think anyone, whether they liked this picture or not, can agree that Shreck is the highlight.So what more can I say? I honestly gave ""Nosferatu"" an honest chance. I'm a pretty lenient critic and am willing to forgive a lot of faults. I just wasn't highly entertained by this one. Even movies long considered classics can turn out dull.",Nosferatu
136,williampsamuel,Still Creepy After All These Years,10,7 January 2015,"Allow me to start off by saying that Nosferatu is a complete, shameless rip-off of Dracula. Sure, the vampire's name has been changed, and the story moved from London to Bremen, but the plot and many of the characters remain the same. Bram Stoker's widow actually sued the filmmakers for copyright infringement, securing a court order that all copies of the film be destroyed. We are fortunate today that a handful of prints survived. Sure, Nosferatu may be a rip-off, but it's still one heck of a horror movie.The movie does have some very real problems. Although the filmmakers had one of the great novels of the previous century to work with, the problems of adapting it into a screenplay, together with the constraints inherent to all silent films medium, mean that some plot points never become all the way clear. There is also a bit of Bad Exposition Syndrome involving the film's solution. And although Professor Van Helsing appears, he never actually confronts the villain.But the issues are more than made up for by Nosferatu's sheer creepiness. Conrad Viet (?) playing the title role, sports one of the all time great horror movie makeup jobs. His pointed ears, completely bald head, narrow cheekbones, and bushy eyebrows give him an aspect that is terrible to behold. His hands are oversized, with his fingers narrowing into long claws. And forget the standard pair of fangs; all of his teeth are needle sharp, and his mouth is absolutely packed with them.This eeriness extends to practically every other aspect of the film as well. The Transylvanian castle fills the viewer with foreboding from the moment it is first seen, and the darkly lit halls and corridors within are no less disquieting. Even more menacing is the ruined manor in Bremen. Every window is broken, part of the roof is collapsed, and indeed it seems that at any moment the entire structure could come crashing down.The special effects are also worth noting. Although crude by today's standards, there is still something frightening about seeing doors open and close on their own, or coffin lids floating through the air. We know that these sights can't be real; the jerkiness of the movements tells us that something is up. But the incompleteness of the illusion only adds to the feeling that something is not right, heightening our sense of apprehension.Great advances in production values have taken place since this film was made, and I admit that Todd Browning's Dracula, made only a decade later, had much better plot and characterization. But Nosferatu is still the one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen, able to give even the hardiest of audiences nightmares. And if it can still have this effect today, just imagine what it must have been like for people watching this in 1921. It's not hard to picture many a burgher making their way home through the dark, narrow streets of Berlin or Munich, convinced that their every step was shadowed by an immortal being that lived only to suck the very life out of them, and to You're not reading this in the dark are you?",Nosferatu
137,Screen_O_Genic,"One of the Landmark Horror Classics, Perhaps the Peak of German Expressionism",8,25 August 2019,"Based on the famous Bram Stoker novel ""Dracula"", ""Nosferatu"" is a dark experience into fear, uncertainty and sexuality. Set in the early 19th-Century in Germany, a jolly regular Joe named Hutter is sent by his employer on a long trip to settle a business transaction with a client. Hutter proceeds on his journey and as he nears his destination a sense of dread creeps in starting with worried locals, reluctant coachmen and an ominous landscape that seems to engulf one as the clueless protagonist meets his tragic fate.Cloaked in artful black and white, ""Nosferatu"" glows with a luminous eerieness that still emits an undeniable chill after nearly a century. The ghoulish-looking characters are the epitome of the grotesque and the macabre, and Max Schreck's iconic portrayal of Count Orlok grows more unsettling with time: the tall, rail-thin figure, pointed hook nose, protruding ears and wide, gouged eyes is the scariest vampire the silver screen has known. The overly dramatic acting and slow pace bespeaks its time but the film is a grower and leaves a lasting impression. One of the silent classics and a landmark in Horror, ""Nosferatu"" is perhaps the peak of German Expressionism.",Nosferatu
138,hasosch,Monstrosity With Human Substrate,10,19 February 2009,"In 1853, the German philosopher Karl Rosenkranz wrote a standard work about ""The Estetics of Ugliness"". In his book, he also differentiated several types of ugliness which are normally perceived as horrific, f.ex. the nauseating, the criminal, the diabolical, the demonic type, the witch-type, the satanic type. He also suggested a comprehensive typology about the features which cause horror, such as horror by nature, horror by mind, artificial horror, and he even added a chapter about the pleasure of horror. Of course, Rosenkranz could not know that already two generations after him one would use the possibilities of film in order to combine his types or even to invent new ones.The reason why F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" is still being counted amongst the best 100, 50 or even 10 horror movies of all time, lies without doubt in the fact that Count Orlok is not an alien, but a human monstrosity who could have been found in one of the many deformation cabinets on the fairgrounds still at the beginning of the 20th century. He was possibly surpassed only by the Elephant Man who left, at least in the present author, a fright that would not go away soon when he saw that movie for the first time. Horror-types that are related to that of Count Orlok could also be found in the first ""Ghost Trains"" (or ""Dark Rides"") since the end of the 20ies. Only later, one would start to deviate from this Orlok-type of ""horror by nature"" which does not stand by chance at the top of Rosenkranz' list. Since we are part of nature, we seem to feel more intensely touched by monsters whose human part is still shining through, so to say. Even today, after having experienced a whole typology of monstrousness, we still feel creepier in watching Count Orlok than Freddie Krueger. The reason for all that lies possibly in the fact that the human brain is incapable of imagining a monster without any human substrate, and amongst these monsters with human substrate, the types of ""horror by nature"" are the most creepy ones.",Nosferatu
139,tnrcooper,Iconic horror film,10,2 January 2012,"Amazing horror film - iconic images from this film have echoed down the years. The image of Orlok's shadow cast on a wall as he climbed the stairs, Orlok rising out of his coffin, and the shot of Orlok carrying his coffin walking through Bremen are iconic images which many moviewatchers have seen even if they don't know where they come from.The movie was called Nosferatu because Bram Stoker's widow wouldn't grant permission for the use of her deceased husband's book and so director F.W. Murnau changed Dracula's name to Orlock (Max Schreck), he made Van Helsing into Professor and set the film in Bremen rather than London. That said, the outlines of the movie are similar apart from those simple name changes.This is a scary movie - from the creepiness of Orlock to the eeriness of real-estate agent Knock (Alexander Granach) to the impressive cross-cutting of Hutter's (Gustav von Wangenheim) suffering at the hands of Orlok to his wife Ellen (Greta Schroeder) empathizing and sensing his suffering. It is full of moments which will creep you out. Some of the acting is a bit hammy, but the essential story as told by Murnau and writer Henry Galeen is creepy and Murnau paces the film deftly. Truly a classic which will stay with you forever.",Nosferatu

141,meathookcinema,A true Gothic masterpiece,10,1 November 2017,"In the 80s with new horror films like The Evil Dead pushing the boundaries of the genre, television companies thought that older horror films ceased to be scary and so could be shown during the daytime. And so I saw Nosferatu which was made in 1922 one Bank Holiday morning. It couldn't possibly frighten me, right? It scared the hell out of me. And watching it again now it still freaks me out. An unofficial adaptation of Dracula (the estate of Bram Stoker sued and wanted all copies of Nosferatu destroyed. Luckily this didn't happen) this is beautifully shot and directed. In fact I could look at any frame from this movie and drool. This is an early example that a horror film didn't have to be some kind of example of low culture but could actually be art. Max Shreck's Nosferatu is pitch perfect and the very embodiment of evil.

It's an exemplary good film, in its own right, but I wouldn't consider it as terryfing as this one.In this age, where special effects have replaced plot, and where thrills are represented by a loud noise, followed by an unexpected apparition, Nosferatu shines. This is a movie that preys on your inner fears, where slowly opening doors play with your imagination and make you feel scared just because of what might happen next, where the crude special effects are not the goal, but a medium. After a while, you will notice that Nosferatu's image will become embedded with your worst fears.Sadly, as it has been said before, the print for this movie is very badly beaten. But don't worry. Even this adds to the ambiance.It's worthy to note that most of the locations where this film was made are still standing, just because the filmmaker chose those that were already historic by the time he made the picture. This is shown in amazing detail in the DVD editions.",Nosferatu
144,PCC0921,Forget What You Know About Dracula. This is Nosferatu.,8,7 January 2021,"Forget what you know about Dracula, Tod Browning, Universal Pictures and even that awkwardly good Italian version of Dracula (1931), directed by George Melford. Browning and Melford's classic Dracula is different from Nosferatu (1922). Yes, it's the same characters, same story and from the same source materials, but because of the entertainment business and all it's legalities, this film became different. That's a good thing, because it offers things that Dracula could not. Enter German director F.W. Murnau and freakishly perfect for the Nosferatu, Count Orlack role, Max Schreck.Much like Metropolis (1927), there are many versions of this film out there too. Mostly, because, the Nosferatu film also had certain parts lost and rediscovered over the last 100 years. There are actually versions of it out there that has the names changed back to Dracula, Van Helsing, Renfield, Lucy and Mina. Being many years later now, that legalities thing I mentioned before doesn't mean much today. So now we can see it in all it's glory. If you can find the restored Blu-Ray version, that has color tints, all the original English text put back in with all the Murnau character names returned and comes with the original soundtrack by Hans Erdmann, then you probably have the best representation of the film you can find.This film covers certain areas a little more than Dracula (1931), did. most notably, the plight of the death ship, Hutters journey and how Orlack gets his coffin to the ship. It follows the diary/journal format that Bram Stoker's novel did. Instead of being low-brow, calm and sophisticated, like Bela Lugosi, Orlack is more animated, cautious and less human-looking. The film has a great style to it and a really interesting history. You should read up on it. For the 100 year old imagery and the craft of F.W. Murnau, that alone is worth seeing this, but there is much more.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Nosferatu

146,faraaj-1,Disappointing after Caligari,6,16 December 2006,"Nosferatu, the famous German version of Bram Stoker's Dracula is something of a disappointment. Visually, it's nothing compared to expressionist masterpieces like Caligari or Metropolis. I understand that actual Eastern European locations and buildings were used instead of sets. That was a mistake. You just have to look at the beauty of Lugosi's castle in the 1931 English version of the Bram Stoker novel to see why. There is no reason why Nosferatu - given the expressionist abilities of the Germans - could not have been even more beautiful than Dracula.Also, the pacing feels quite sluggish for a 94 minute long movie. The only exceptional thing for me was Max Schreck as a truly vile Count Orlock. He is physically repulsive and looks like a monster. He has none of the campiness of Lugosi or the physical power of a Christopher Lee - just a menacing, detestable, sickly creature. There is an excellent movie called The Shadow of the Vampire starring Willem Dafoe as Schreck. Its a fictional movie but much more watchable than Nosferatu. I actually wasted time watching this because of Shadow of the Vampire and my liking for Caligari and Metropolis. This isn't even remotely as good.",Nosferatu
147,foxtografo,"Great monster look, but it's far from perfect",6,25 July 2019,"I know everyone's going to hate me, but this is my humble opinion.
I loved the monstrous Nosferatu's design and how it fits in the creepy environments and atmosphere given. Also the ominous feeling set by the story, but not really much more that I liked.
Hutter's performance is so overacted that annoyed me all the movie, that's probably the worst of all.
I have to say I'm not a silent cinema lover, but I can appreciate the production, the photography and other aspects, understanding the age of the movie.
Metropolis totally blew my mind when I saw it, and it's way longer than this one! This one just bored me throughout and I only found interesting some shots of the Nosferatu and a few photography aspects of the movie.
Not even Schreck's performance I found exceptional, It was basically standing around and moving curved, and looking creepy in costume, which he did good, but at the time of actually interacting with other characters it wasn't brilliant. The make up wasn't so good neither. I've seen better even in very old movies.
The special effects are quite unimpressive, I'm sure they could have been better if they used a bit of imagination, the opening doors could have used strings instead of stop motion, for example.
Some shots and scenes look amazing, some look so uninteresting and uninspired, it's quite uneven in this way.
I totally understand the value of this movie, it's ageing, I'm sure everyone was terrified back then and it's understandable why, the atmosphere and creepiness are there and it's palpable, but that it's not enough for me to make it a great movie.
The pace was quite boring, way too long for the scope of the story.
It's more a photography experiment than a good movie for me.
Again, I know this is a classic, and I'm not trying to argue that, but being objective, I didn't feel it was a great movie.",Nosferatu
148,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,Frightening vampire but simple plot,5,11 April 2015,"The movie was made in 1922 which would make it younger than The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari which I consider superior in every way. Sure Max Shreck is really frightening as the vampire, here called Count Orlok because copyright issues didn't allow the director to use the Dracula name even though the movie is clearly based on the Dracula novel. This means that Nosferatu is the first Dracula movie preceding the Dracula movie from Universal Studios by 9 years. Dracula from Universal developed its story and characters out better than Nosferatu. Sure the fact that Nosferatu is a silent works as disadvantage but it could have been made up by atmosphere which I find is really lacking. I do the comparison with Cabinet of Dr. Caligari which had much more atmosphere and actually a good story and characters. Nosferatu relies too much on the creepiness of count Orlok. The story is so simple, the characters underdeveloped. Interesting to see as piece of history but there is better silents and silent horrors out there. Not to forget showing hyenas when talking about wolves, it's strange they could get away with that.",Nosferatu
149,kurosawakira,"The Name, A Curse",8,4 June 2014,"I had lots of fun reading Stoker's novel last autumn. Knowing the book by its reputation only as the vampire story that defined and started it all, after finally reading it (actually, I listened to it for the most part) I realized how little my expectations actually prepared for the wonderful story and above all, the sophisticated narrative structure of the thing: to present the story as a collection of documents, all with their own points of view, from which the ""author"" weaves, in the guise of an editor, the narrative for us. What rocks my world is, of course, the unnaturally acute subjectivity this method emphasizes that can be appreciated and used in abundance in modern art, even in the most mundanely mainstream production that's about avoiding risk, not inviting it.What made the experience even richer was then to proceed with Murnau's film, available on Blu-ray courtesy of the Masters of Cinema series in a beautiful restoration; after that I'd proceed to Herzog's remake, ""Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht"" (1979) and close it all with Merhige's ""Shadow of the Vampire"" (2000), a brilliant piece of cinema in its own right, not merely as an insight into the Murnau film.So here we are. I had of course seen this in the distant and apocryphal past, but the only lasting impression of it was that I really didn't like it that much. As has become a habit of sorts lately, I'm all into revisiting films and giving — not them — but myself another chance. Now, there are many eerily effective scenes: the carriage is superb and the scenes on the ship are sublime. I still do, however, prefer ""Vampyr"" (1932) as the touchstone of the genre, incomparable in the things it does cinematically, even after 80 years. I don't get that sensation here. For me the type of ""horror"" that this genre exemplifies is most exhibited in Dreyer's unconventional film, where the narrative is shifted from the image to our imagination. The images only serve a kind of hallucinatory ambiance for us to invest ourselves in the film. That kind of cinema doesn't tell, it implies. This film, I'm afraid, is a bit too much of the first sort, despite some of the iconic shots that have become staples of vampire films to come.Not that there aren't many brilliant things here. Among the most interesting is the game it plays with Stoker's novel: it's a film that's not exactly an adaptation but a sibling of a different name; and still it opens as a book, and much like the novel, becomes a recollection of an individual of horrific events. This Dracula-but-not-Dracula level works for its benefit when seen in retrospect.Then there's the emphasis on names, rather underlined because they are supposed to be like characters from Stoker yet aren't. It all starts with Nosferatu, the name that actually occurs twice in Stoker*, and continues to the ship Empusa, which is the name of a Greek demigoddess who used to seduce sleeping men and feast on their flesh and blood. The prologue/overture makes the name Nosferatu into a curse of sorts, warning people from invoking it.And then, of course, the characters of Hutter and Orlok, the first of which is insufferably naive in the beginning, then transformed by Orlok, and then the count himself, who seems so out of place most of the time there's no wonder where the idea for Merhige's film could have originated from. They represent two opposite worlds not only in principle but in reality as well: Hutter is the overtly extrovert an ostentatious, and acts accordingly ostentatiously; Orlok is the silently introvert ghost, whose lank figure creeps and haunts the frame. Their antithetical functions are also emphasized not only in their manners but their houses, especially the ones in Britain. Hutter's house, accommodating him and his wife, is all about idyll and sustaining their marriage, while Orlok's supposed new purchase, the ramshackle house, is all about destruction, and it shows in the exteriors.Although I prefer both Herzog's and Merhige's films over this, a curious occurrence of pure vampirism has taken place: just as those two vampire films suck life from this one, so does Murnau's film grow stronger thanks to the later ""remakes"". * ""Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die, or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would for all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror"" and ""The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once."" The etymology of the word is unclear and still under debate; some trace it to Emily Gerard who argued it's Romanian for ""vampire""; others have not found such a word in the language in its written form, yet it most like exists in the oral tradition as either 'nesuferit' (""the insufferable""), 'necuratu' (""the unclean"") and 'nefârtatu' (""the devil""). Yet Stoker's meaning was most likely ""un-dead"".",Nosferatu
150,Geofbob,A prophetic symbol of the rise of Hitler or just a good vampire movie?,10,29 August 2001,"Nosferatu would probably be almost entirely forgotten today if it weren't for the memorable images of the rat-like Count Orlok. Max Schreck's performance, and the way director H W Murnau uses it, create a screen monster whose appearance is uniquely disgusting, but who at the same time seems perfectly natural. Like the young, eager estate agent, Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) who journeys from Germany to sell him a property, we accept him on his own terms, while knowing in our minds that he is to be feared. Orlak's naturalness is all the more remarkable by contrast with the other characters who we never forget are acting, because of silent cinema's exaggerated facial expressions and movements.
Somebody has commented on IMDb that the film is a portrait of a failed marriage between vain, greedy, uncaring Thomas, and self-abegnating Ellen (Greta Schröder) who has nothing to lose in sacrificing herself to destroy Orlok. Certainly, the couple are ill-suited, but I see Thomas as uncertain, trying to prove himself to an aloof, brooding Ellen. Is she perhaps the ultimate femme fatale, a destroyer who will rise again in Orlok's place to continue spreading plague?  The rats, soil and coffins bring to mind the horrors of the WWI trenches. In 1921, just about when the film was made, Hitler - fascinating to women both personally and nationally - became leader of the Nazi party, and the plague of war would soon return.
The film is usually regarded as being expressionist, and the most vivid images, such as the shadows of Orlok's hands, fall into that category. But much of the outside photography of Hutter travelling through the mountains, of Orlok's castle, and of Ellen by the sea, are nearer to 18th century German romanticism. The Eureka DVD on which I base these comments contains interesting commentaries on the movie's locations (most of which still exist) and its artistic context.  This Australian-produced 2-disc DVD, with sepia and b&w versions of the film, has very expressive background music by Art Zoyd; though I preferred to watch in silence.",Nosferatu

Max Schreck as the titular vampire is beyond horrifying, with images that have the power to stay entrenched in your mind long after the credits. A horror classic.",Nosferatu
152,Vampenguin,A truly terrifying film classic,8,10 April 2006,"One of the few truly terrifying films ever made, Nosferatu is a classic film, pure and simple. The atmosphere is phenomenal, just bristling with that early German style. Max Shrek looks incredible as Orlock, easily the most terrifying image of a vampire of all-time. As for the score, I saw the Type O Negative version. Very uneven, though at times it's truly amazing. In many scenes it seems very out of place, but in others such as the infamous Door scene, it fit perfectly and elevated the tension of an already scary scene. The actors weren't very good, but it's not often you see a silent film with good actors. Overall this is one of the only films that can actually scare me. Though Dracula '31 is easily a better film, it doesn't even hold a candle to this in terms of pure scare factor.8.5/10 PS - The DVD I have had a rather interesting introduction by David Carradine that I enjoyed.",Nosferatu
153,chelano,yellow to blue,10,8 October 2011,"Yes this is an old film and the actual dialog script is probably about 2 pages. But this film does things to make it a piece of art. The music really shows the different scenes and what is going on. Also the color lens they use to show a moment. Like happiness or daylight was yellow but evil or darkness was blue. There was a strange moment when red was used too. Again there is no sound of voices, but some of the acting was pretty good. A lot of it seems cheesy from the time it was made, but two characters to me really stick out. Of course the first is Max Schreck as Nosferatu and then the other is Alexander Granach as Knock. Two really really boggled my mind about this film. There was a shot of a ship in water and it was a great shot. There are low budget movies now a days that use CG ships and it looks horrible, yet this 1920s film went all out. The other thing is the vampire. How scary is he? I mean look at how deformed he looks. There are some vampire movies that have more deformed vampires, but then look at others. Like Twilight. Vampires are meant to be scary and Hosferatu is one freaky looking vampire.",Nosferatu
154,thinbeach,Nosferatu,2,7 December 2015,"The shots and lighting from Murnau and co. are masterful while the performance of Max Schreck as the vampire is one of the creepiest and most memorable in cinema history, but these things alone can not make up for the boredom of the story, whose plot is thin, has too much of a reliance on title cards, overacted performances by the rest of the cast, and runs too long.Those hoping for a tense or suspenseful horror by modern standards will not find it here, and I would recommend it only to those with a keen interest in film history, or filmmakers interested in the craft.I simply cannot understand how this film has received the amount of acclaim it has, although like other interesting looking sleepers such as 'Dr. Calligari' and 'Metropolis', I can only imagine there are a whole bunch of very visually orientated people out there who like unusual ideas, and are more or less wholly unaffected by story.",Nosferatu
155,Kubris,Nos-fer-a-tu!,7,29 November 2011,"As a very young person relative to this film, I first heard of Nosferatu through Spongebob Squarepants in their funny horror episode. That was years ago. Finally I got around to seeing this classic horror. What can I say about it? It was OK.As a loose adaptation of Dracula, the film's plot cuts out a lot of the story and adds a little. No Van Helsing or Lucy-alikes, shortened sequences of... everything, but with the additions of Knock, an ending I liked, and a great boat scene.The music in the version I saw was great, one of the best parts. I believe it was composed by James Bernard, and it was excellent. As said before, the other things I enjoyed were the boat scene, left ambiguous in the 'Dracula' I read, but shown here in the film, with the scariest results in the film. Also, the ending, was a heroic sacrifice, even though it didn't make much sense. Also, Max Schreck's menacing Nosferatu is just iconic.I didn't find the film the most engaging though, and some unnecessary things were put in. The film is short and cuts out a lot, but leaves in irrelevant things. At 90 years old, the films has aged worse than even other silent films. It's a classic horror fans should see, or if it's on you should see it just for kicks. Just don't expect to get your socks knocked off like it's 1922. 7.3/10",Nosferatu

What a creepy and unsettling film this is.
In fact, when it come to horror movies that predate the 70's this might be the creepiest and scariest that I've seen and it's also a fantastic film, in fact, it's probably one of the best and definitely one of the most memourable films from the silent era. One of the biggest contributers for this is without a doubt Max Schrecks's terrifying performance as Count Orlok, his scenes are extremely creepy to say the least, one of the best examples is when he is standing in the door frame that is barely big enough for him to pass through, his creepy and unatural design and the incredible makeup truelly make it one of cinema's most recognisable villains, well that and his appearance in 2 spongebob episodes.
The film uses parallel editing to a great effect like we see in the scene where Hutter races to get home by land while Orlok travells by sea and Ellen is waiting wich I really like and the same goes for the use of stop motion and accelerated moments like when Hutter travells to Orlok's castle.
Overall I really liked this film and while Dracula from 1931 is also really good I would say that, so far, this is probably the best adaptation of Bram Stroker's Dracula that I've seen.

157,thisissubtitledmovies,an incredible film,10,21 January 2011,"excerpt, full review at my location.Despite being released 90 years ago, Nosferatu remains one of the most iconic and infamous horror films of all time. Back in 1922, critics described Nosferatu as a masterpiece and it continues to find new audiences with every passing year. It has been remade, parodied and even gained its own mythos with Shadow Of The Vampire. So what, exactly, makes this movie stand the test of time?As with many silent era classics, the whole movie is now available to enjoy on YouTube, without committing an act of piracy since Nosferatu is now a public domain film. There are also countless (excuse the pun!) versions and restorations available, some of which even have new inter- titles which have changed the characters names to Dracula and Harker. So really, it has never been easier to see this incredible film – a film which changed the vampire legend and shaped the future of horror.",Nosferatu

Certainly, there's never been a better vampire performance on film. But the film itself is something of a relic -- not too frightening by current standards, with a Germanic heaviness of mood that bogs down the whole film. For many, that's the charm. For still others, the film is indeed chilling, even scary. It failed to affect me one way or the other. At times, I was frankly bored.",Nosferatu
159,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: German Filmmaker F. W. Murnau's Epic Tale of Endless Horror.,9,30 May 2015,"Nosferatu is a 1922 silent Gothic horror film directed by legendary German filmmaker, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. F. W. Murnau—a prominent figure in the German expressionist movement of the 1920s—is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the silent era. Nosferatu, also known as Nosferatu–A Symphony of Horror, stars Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok. Murnau's Nosferatu was supposed to be an adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 epic vampire extravaganza, Dracula, but after the studio failed to procure the rights of the book from Stoker's widow, the names and other details were deliberately adjusted so as to avoid the hassles of copyright infringement. However, this deviation was not enough to deceive the court, which gave its verdict in the favor of Stoker's widow. After the film studio (Prana Film) declared its bankruptcy, the court instructed to destroy all the existing prints of Nosferatu. If it wouldn't have been for the one surviving copy of the film, which had already been distributed all around the world, we would have surely been deprived of the privilege of savoring this true gem of cinema.What makes Murnau's Nosferatu remarkable, in comparison to the countless other renditions, is that apart from keeping the eerie feeling of Stoker's Dracula intact it also succeeds in doing away with the theatrical gimmicks (that can offer tear apart an entire narrative), thus relying heavily on the development of its characters as well as its plot. This enriches Murnau's characters with an inherent sense of realism that the characters in the book's other cinematic renditions are so ostentatiously devoid of. Max Schreck's Count Orlok, in exact contract to the character's future portrayals on the celluloid, is what he is supposed to be: a cursed creature depraved by centuries of hapless suffering and solitude, who obviously lacks the glamour of a celebrated vampire being made to bask in the glory of his own grandeur.One vampire movie that comes very close to Murnau's Nosferatu in its expression of horro is E. Elias Merhige's metafiction horror film, Shadow of the Vampire (2000). The movie, coincidentally, shares a more intimate relation with Nosferatu, for it narrates a fictionalized account of the filming of Murnau's 1922 epic. The movie stars John Malkovich as F. W. Murnau and Willem Dafoe as Count Orlok. The beauty of Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire is that it serves two different purposes at the same time: It triumphantly presents a fictionalized account of the making of Nosferatu. And, it also serves to be a Gothic horror film of its own. Malkovich's Murnau comes across as a meticulous filmmaker who seems so obsessed about his art that he wouldn't think twice about sacrificing his cast and crew members in order to fulfill his artistic vision. Dafoe's Count Orlok is an actor so committed to his act that he wouldn't leave a single stone unturned in order to bring the Gothic vampire to life. While Dafoe's masterful performance resonates with Max Schreck's iconic portrayal, John Malkovich's F. W. Murnau has all the qualities of becoming the cinematic archetype of a mad artist obsessed with his art.Over the last nine decades, Nosferatu has not only enjoyed a strong cult following, but has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Renowned film critic Roger Ebert writes in his review of Nosferatu, ""To watch F.W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu'' is to see the vampire movie before it had really seen itself. Here is the story of Dracula before it was buried alive in clichés, jokes, TV skits, cartoons and more than 30 other films. The film is in awe of its material. It seems to really believe in vampires."" Over the years, Stoker's Count Dracula has enjoyed an unprecedented following, one that is matched only by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's super-sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, with Stoker's Gothic super-villain making a major appearance in more than 200 films. Suffice it is to say that the universal popularity of Stoker's Dracula owes a colossal debt to Murnau's Nosferatu, which not only made Stoker's epic vampire saga a household phenomenon, but also immortalized Stoker's vampire as the supreme symbol of Gothic terror in the world of cinema. Even today, Murnau's Nosferatu serves as a great means to get acquainted with Stoker's timeless tale of terror. Nosferatu still continues to be unparalleled in its demonstration of unrestrained terror in the world of cinema.

160,mrush,The grandfather of all great horror movies,9,7 May 2006,"This is one of the truly great horror movies.It is the story of Dracula although he isn't called Dracula because of legal reasons involving Bram Stoker's estate.Maybe it is just as well because this 1922 classic isn't like any Dracula you've ever seen.Even by the time of Bela Lugosi's classic ,Dracula was portrayed as a suave debonair count.But in this great film the Count is a scary little thing.Rat-faced with sharp rat teeth and long nails and the look of disease all about him.Max Schreck is simply amazing in his role as the Count.His portrayal of the ugly little monster is one of the greatest roles ever captured on film.Speaking of captured on film,this film is almost a hundred years old ,and it looks it.There are evenly lit places and scratchy looking segments and the film speed is a little off in places but that all just adds to the great atmosphere that this masterpiece has.Several scenes from this film have become iconic,none more so then the Count rising straight up from the bottom of the ship.The scene where the Count carries his coffin through the town is as freaky and eerie as anything I've seen.The way Max Schreck walks will even scare you.There was a rather expensive restored version of this film done back in the 1990's.Most cheaper copies will come with a crappy added on sound track,death metal or something like that,I always turn that off along with all the lights and let this little creepy silent film flicker away in the still of the night.Watch this one if you haven't.It will stay with you.",Nosferatu
161,gcrokus,Noseferatu Started It All!,10,18 March 2009,"""Noseferatu"" is one chilling film, and a must-see for any lover of the horror genre. It really sets the stage for Hollywood's steady production of vampire-related tales for more than three generations. About the only negative thing about it is that director F. W. Murnau didn't ask for permission to adapt Bram Stoker's original 1897 novel to the screen, and a long legal battle developed with Stokers' widow. Murnau lost the case in 1925 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker) but prints luckily survived.Beginning with real estate agent Hutter going to Transyvania to secure the sale of a house in Germany to Count Orlock, Hutter soon finds that all is not normal in the life of the Count. Even the carriage ride to Orlock's castle is odd; Murnau chooses to speed up the film anytime said conveyance moves. The behaviour of local townspeople and, shortly after the carriage ride, Hutter's introduction to the Count, plunges us into a seriously dark world. And there is no less a discovery by Hutter of a book about vampires. There are a number of film-history moments in the early going, but one that I don't recall seeing in any other vampire film is Orlock's rise up from a seeming prostrate position. This not only startles Hutter but we as well. Any student of vampire lore (at least the popular image of it) will recognize the close parallel between Murnau's movie and subsequent films about Dracula. I grew up with the far more widely known Bela Lugosi rendition which in its own right is a fine film, another whose themes are widely copied. The actual quality of the film is a little suspect. I think we are fortunate the film is even available, and the slightly disjointed print is not so terrible as to make it less visually disturbing. There has been speculation about the star of Noseferatu (Max Schreck as Count Orlock) and its director F.W. Murnau for what seems like forever. I recall reading a story in a magazine during my teens that perpetuated the notion that Schreck was himself a vampire. This is a far remove from what really seems to be the case, that he merely a loner in his private life. Noseferatu is a four star movie.",Nosferatu

By today's standards, it's pretty tame and the count looks a bit goofy, but I bet in 1922 it was pretty scary...like when he rises out of the coffin. It's quite an innovative film.  It wasn't just in black and white, but used different color tints to signify different lighting (blue for night, yellow for candlelight, etc), which really made it more realistic. It had nice fades between the scenes and use of negative film for some interesting effects.  The scenery shots at the beach were beautifully shot and they worked well to contrast the tighter interior shots. It had most of the key elements in a Dracula movie; Taking different forms, hypnotic telepathy, a good Renfield character, no sunlight, etc. Though his reflection did show in the mirror.  The DVD I watched had a choice of two audio tracks: The Silent Orchestra or an Organ score composed and performed by by Timothy Howard.  I sampled them both in the beginning and a couple times throughout the movie, but the organ won out.  The orchestra was well done, but the simple organ music added to the eeriness of the movie.

As for Murnau's earlier masterpiece, ""Nosferatu"", it has certainly been released in any number of DVD versions -- some of them quite nice. As this films was originally found to be in copyright violation (the filmmakers not having bothered to get the book rights from Braum Stoker's wife) and the court order to destroy the original and all copies, one was grateful that the film somehow had survived and was available in decent form to see at all. Now comes Kino's Ultimate Edition with a high definition transfer made from the finest surviving archival material from around the world. Who would have ever guessed that this film could be seen in such a breathtaking form! I've viewed the film many, many times -- but seeing this Ultimate Edition I felt like I was seeing it the way it would have been seen back in 1922.

167,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,A Classic Horror That Holds Up,8,11 July 2019,"F.W. Murnau's masterpiece, ""Nosferatu"" (1922), was a milestone of horror.

169,joshuafagan-64214,Still Great and a Huge Milestone of Film,10,27 September 2015,"This is not going to be a long review. In fact, consider it less of a review and more a bundling together of observations I had while watching the classic silent horror film Nosferatu.It is strange how this became the most recognized and the greatest of all classic Dracula films without even officially featuring Dracula. The Germans that made this film were unable to secure the rights to Stoker's novel, so they just changed a few names and made the film anyways. Normally, this results in a cheap, bargain-basement product. But every now and then it results in a classic, like this here.It is also to blame for many of the traits about Dracula that date back to the novel, such as that he is killed by sunlight. Far more people feel this movie's influence than have ever watched it, which is a shame, since it is one of the best movies of its decade, elegantly shot and stirringly scored.There is a reason that this film is subtitled A Symphony of Terror. You aren't just watching a visual display, you are given a feast for the ears. One of the best scores in film accompanies this film; one that makes this film feel less like a broad form of entertainment and more like a piercing symphony, with notes instead of swords. Certainly, there was more emphasis on music in the old days in film. Be prepared if you haven't watched before a film from this time.The use of chromatic filters has always been one of my favorite techniques, and its use in this film helps maintain a flowing, even turn that never stagnates. The colors are not harsh, but you feel its effects fully.As for the cinematography, there a number of shots that stick out to this reviewer. Among them are many simple shots, such as the ones of the castle in the daytime, the one zooming up to the ship carrying Count Orloc (Dracula), and the one of the seas being looked out at by the wistful love interest.One thing I can say for this film that I cannot say for others is that it is classy. It may give up some scare-points for it, but it revels in the high horror mythos, using a refined and efficient touch. Most of the terror of the film is implied; best for the restriction-heavy decade in which it was made, but also for foreshadowing and anticipation. Many films try to keep their secrets from you, not letting you know what happens. This film doesn't; you know what will happen and it is by such that the film is scary; dramatic irony is in full effect here. What is perhaps most remarkable is that it does it without being dragged down by a general sense of boredom and slowness; it is calculating and maneuverable, like a snake slithering through the midnight sky. This film does not fall into clichés; it sets the clichés for films to come. That is an impressive feat.This is not a perfect movie; many of the plot holes of other horror movies were also passed down from this one. If the film was faster paced, it would be alright, but as it is, counting on those beats to carry tension, it often instead makes you ask questions. But to seriously attempt to degrade this film is a bit like throwing stones against a monolith. Such flaws are nothing compared to what this film authored. It may not be the best film ever, but it is brimming with ambition and beauty and is anyway one of the most important films ever made.Thanks to a recent recovery project, this film can now be watched in full; so grab your horse and ride into the call of the deathbird.",Nosferatu

It basically follows the plot of Bram Stoker's Dracula novel (even more so than the 1931 film), but winds down to an original ending during the last half hour. It revolves around the ploy of the vampire Count Orlok, who buys real estate in Germany and takes interest in the neighbor's wife.The cinematography is very well done. The shadows and angles in every scene are well-placed. The segments where Orlok's shadow is shown pacing along a wall are effective and suspenseful. Orlok himself is brilliantly designed, possibly being one of the best monsters in film history. The make-up and costume work done on Max Schreck is phenomenal for the time. Schreck's acting style is fitting as well.The plot is a little bit jumbled up, but flows smoothly nonetheless. It felt like too much of the content was unrelated to Orlok. The scenes about carnivorous plants were excellent, but some other scenes did not have much value. Also, it felt like there were too many plot lines, which lead to a few plot holes. I would rather have them traded for more screen time on Orlok.Overall, the film is excellent for its age. It has problems that come about from being a silent film, but is compelling to watch.

It's got a great atmosphere, and it's absolutely more engaging whenever Max (who plays this version of Count Dracula) is on screen. Max-without a doubt-is the Heath Ledger Joker of this flick. I say that in the sense of saying that Max makes a memorable performance that bothers someone like myself, who's not only grown-up on horror flicks of all degrees, but who doesn't tend to be afraid of horror films, these days. This film creeps me out.The film itself feels pretty bland, with all the age the almost-one-hundred years have placed on its shoulders. I haven't seen many silent films, but I can say that I probably wouldn't like this movie as much without Max's Count Dracula performance. The way he moves is absolutely horrifying, and his skinniness adds to the terror. There's something in his eyes that frighten me-and most people I've talked to, who've actually taken the time out to watch this classic.My title may seem obnoxious to bigger fans, but yes, in the end, I do consider this a classic. It DESERVES to be remembered, strictly because of Max. How many modern films have we seen have performances like this one? Not many.",Nosferatu
177,KennethEagleSpirit,One of the best films ever made!,9,2 February 2007,"This film is both a ground breaker and a classic. Ground breaking in that it was the first vampire movie, the first in its use of sunlight to kill a vampire (which thing I understand to have been a new concept at that time and original to this film), and a leader in the genre due to its style and quality. Classic in the use of black and white, shadow and light, makeup, and special effects. The scenes, the way they're shot, and the flow of this film are marvels. Max Schreck is the perfect vampire. He represents the animated corpse in wonderful fashion. The story line, character development, continuity, photography in particular, and attention to detail are a tribute to the German cinematic artistic ability of the day. This thing is more than just worth watching. Its worth watching again. It would seem that great vampire movies are like that. Just when you think they're dead forever they resurrect.",Nosferatu
178,98nurdinm-1,"""Nosferatu"" - not that bad-ooo",4,3 March 2006,"""Nosferatu"" is a classic - there's no doubt about that. It's the film that gave us such scenes that have remained deep within the logs of cinema history - the shadow creeping up the stairs, Max Shreck's look as the bloodthirsty Count Orlak, the German Expressionism....And yet, for me, this film was spoilt utterly and brutally by a completely rubbish score. I'm not sure which version I watched - though it was on DVD - but it sounded like an eight-year-old child playing with one of those cheap keyboards. There were elements of Goth Rock, Choirs singing, wind whistling - and it just didn't work! With a different score I may have really liked this film, perhaps even loved it - but the music, such an important factor to the film anyway on account of it being ""silent"", took all the suspense out of it.4/10",Nosferatu
179,highclark,How to get plague off your teeth...,7,30 May 2011,"While it is a creepy film and at times quite brilliant in capturing with shadows and stop motion photography sense of true dread, the main culprit in the undermining of Nosferatu is with it's clunky story telling and comical acting.I will normally cut a lot of slack for the temperament of silent film theatrics, but considering the place this film holds amongst most, if not all critics, I'm going to have to judge it a little bit harder than the other classic films of its time. Again, kudos for finding and then maintaining such a great look and feel throughout the entire film, but really, I can't go any higher than a seven. There's too many questions concerning the two main characters in their haste to race back from Transylvania. Why won't Hutter take his love away from Nosferatu? He did sell him the house across the street, he had to know this scenario was going to take place. Also, why leave it as a mystery to the character of Knock? At least with Renfield we understand why he is slave to Dracula. In Nosferatu there's not much to go on plot wise to signify any connection, other than that crazy looking home buyers document. I realized Knock was crazy, but I didn't know he was Transylvanian crazy.This is a must see film, don't get me wrong. But other than making a note of it and moving on to other films, I can't see why this film get the love it gets from critics.But, it is really, really creepy.",Nosferatu

Although the 20's was when the film was still in infancy. This was a benchmark in horror.

My DVD rental was through Netflix and severely detracted from the film. There were no color filters added to this cut, which meant that I had to watch Nosferatu parade around in the daylight. Why did they film night scenes during the day anyway? Make sure you get a release that has the color filters added. The soundtrack varies from release to release as well. My version had a beautifully orchestrated symphonic masterpiece, that was at odds with what was being shown more often than not.

If one has ever read Bram Stoker's Dracula then one should know when they see this movie that it is a complete rip off of Dracula. One point off for being unoriginal. Nine points for having enough guts to be the first to make Dracula into a movie under a new title. The story isn't much different from Dracula as memory recalls and as mentioned above. Nosferatu has been rated number two or three on the scariest movies ever created list. The obvious number one is the Exorcist. If you ever get a chance, see this.

185,dav07dan02,max schreck is a real vampire!,10,22 June 2005,"Director: F.W. Murnau, Script: Henrik Galeen, Novel: Bram Stoker, Cast: Max Schreck(Orlok), Gustav von Waggenheim(Johannes), Greta Schroeder-Matray(Ellen).This is the ultimate vampire movie. Easily superior to the Tod Browning, Bela Lugosi version done in 1931. This has long been a favorite early horror film among fans. Murnau had difficulty producing this film due to resistance from Bram Stoker's widow. To get around this, all the character names where changed.This film is set in 1800's Germany. Johannes, a real estate man, has to leave his wife, Ellen, for a while to travel to Transylvania to sell a flat to Orlock. Orlock, of course, is the vampire and the place that he is to selling to Orlock is across the street from Johannes's place. When Orlock arrives in Bremen, their town, a plague is brought among the village. The journey that Johannes takes to get there is amazing. We are taken through beautiful country with the alps in the background. When he gets close to Orlok's, he comes to a bridge and his ride stop's there. The driver of the carriage will not go across the bridge to ""the land of the phantoms"". The bridge represents a change from normalcy to an eerie otherworld.This movie even by todays standards has some rather creepy moments. Orlock has a rat-like face with big front teeth and big ears. He is easily the creepiest Dracula. There is a scene where it is nighttime and Ellen gets out of bed and goes to the window to find this shadow of a figure starring into her apartment from his window across the street--very creepy. Max Schreck had such a strange persona that it was rumoured that he was a real vampire. Who am I to dispute this! He sure was convincing. This film is a fine example of the German expressionistic films that where made between the two wars. If you have no horror films from the silent era and are interested in acquiring some, this is the best place to start. Murnau and Fritz Lang was among the two best German directors of this time.",Nosferatu

Nosferatu is a sheer masterpiece in film techniques, as well as a brilliant exercise in the very essence of vampirism down to its simplest manifestation.  Every scenes in this film is literally filled with images that seems to really understand its main subject, and the actor Max Schreck gave an unequalled performance that brought this film to a whole new height.  Considering that its made in 1922, some of the scenes are simply breathtaking ... like when I see the Count revealing his true nature for the first time, as well as the coffin scene where he rises up stiffly .... you can't put a price on that.After seeing this, just about every classic ""Dracula"" movies that I've seen becomes overtly comical and obsolete.  Who wants to see some vampire that wears a halloween cape and a butler's suit?  Not me, after seeing a film that is not just about a vampire sucking people's blood, but the very idea of vampirism itself.  Honestly, those who don't like Nosferatu can't really call themselves true fans of vampire films.  Watch this film, and discover the hidden magic behind this amazing silent masterpiece.",Nosferatu
188,tsf-1962,creepiest show on earth,9,19 November 2006,"This movie is so disturbing on so many levels I don't know where to begin. While Bela Lugosi and his successors have portrayed Count Dracula as a noble, even charming gentleman, Max Schreck's Count Orlock is a hideously deformed monster without any redeeming qualities. There's an uncomfortable touch of racism here: Orlock is the ""other,"" the foreigner, corrupting the blood of pure Aryan maidens. Perhaps the paranoia rampant in post-World War I Germany, a defeated country oppressed by the victors, partially explains this. But what's with the rats? Orlock is portrayed as lord of the rats, a carrier of plague, This is chilling when you consider that the Nazis often portrayed Jews as rats, particularly in the infamous propaganda film ""The Eternal Jew."" I don't know why Germans are obsessed with rats; perhaps they'd be a happier nation if they kept more cats. The bottom line is, this movie gives a disturbing glimpse into the German collective psyche, and goes a long way toward explaining how the Holocaust could have happened.",Nosferatu
189,aqua_swing,Still has great staying power,8,2 December 2005,"There are many things that place this film in your ""see before you die"" category. It's a priceless, fantastic piece of work, from start to finish, and it has beautiful staying power, even now. But there are a few things that work against it. The music to the film lends neither good, nor bad to it. Understandably, this is very early film, and perception of people watching the film in the twenties was probably vastly different, but seeing as this could be considered one of the earliest horror movies, the music from this film could very much have been better used in a silent drama, or comedy.On that note, Max Schreck is perfect. Much has been said about his ability to capture the character so perfectly (as in Shadow of the Vampire), and it's true. Though it's in no way comparable to Bela Lugosi as a character, this movie is still a very important piece in cinema, and I'm honored to be able to say that I've had the opportunity to sit down and enjoy a brilliant work of early cinema.",Nosferatu
190,jhigginbotham151,Max Schreck saves Nosferatu,6,3 May 2014,"Nosferatu is a film I had wanted to see for awhile. All the clips of Max Schreck as Count Orlock was amazing to say the least, the use of shadow was also incredible, it seemed like such a different take on Dracula. But it isn't, its just the typical Dracula story and the fact that its a 90 minutes but only has Schreck in it for a tenth of that doesn't help.The 90 minutes is a problem. Dracula (1931) with Bela Lugosi was 70 minutes and it told its story far better. 'Well it had sound' you may say, well Nosferatu may as well be a sound film because I remember spending quite a bit of time reading during the film. I understand silent films needed title cards to explain the story but if it becomes a detriment to the pace and well being of the film then you have a problem, either trim the story to better fit the lack of sound or just don't make the film. The film just isn't interesting enough to fill its 90 minutes and halfway through, you get bored and just stop reading the title cards, so if you haven't seen any other version of Dracula, the story isn't going to make as much sense to you. The film practically shot itself in the foot here.The lack of Schreck is another problem. While his small appearances throughout the film does make his character all the more mysterious and terrifying, it makes the other 75 or so minutes painfully boring because you're either reading or watching something that isn't as interesting as watching Schreck. Schreck is fantastic as Count Orlock, his unnatural appearance, movements and almost expressionless face is truly a compliment to how terrifying a monster can be with no voice. Sadly, they do give him a voice, he is a god damn gentle man if the title cards are anything to go by, with such horrifying lines as 'What a lovely throat', why would you give a character as horrifying as Orlock such cheesy lines. It just takes away all the mystery and frankly makes him less scary.F.W. Murnau may have made a flawed film but his eye for detail is incredible. His use of shadow is so effective, he manages to convey things no title card could ever convey in words and its a real shame he didn't inject more of this creativity into the rest of the film. The music is very good as well, blending in well with the films tone and its cinematography.Overall, I wish I could say better things about Nosferatu, but its simply to flawed to ignore. I recommend it to any fan of the horror genre because it is a landmark film in the genre and the performance from Schreck and Murnau's fantastic cinematography are deserved of all the praise in the world.",Nosferatu
191,treadwaywrites,Some Better Ideas Than Dracula,8,23 March 2009,"Nosferatu is one of our earliest films and certainly one of our most entertaining of earliest films. The film is shown in virtually every film history class throughout universities around the globe. It has been picked apart from every angle of meaning from that of pure expressionism to political nuance. The film did not win any awards after all the Oscars were still 5 more years away from creation. The film is German and actually titled Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie des Grauens which translates to Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror. The film was instantly paired down to just Nosferatu. Directed by F.W. Murnau and staring Max Schreck as the vampire, the film was shot in 1921 and released in 1922. The story is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but the names and details were changed in the movie because the studio was unable to buy the rights to the novel. Items like ""vampire"" became ""Nosferatu"" and ""Count Dracula"" became ""Count Orlok.""We're lucky to have this film at all. Nosferatu was the first and only production of Prana Film company which was founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and Albin Grau. Albin Grau was an artist and specialized in the occult. Due to lawsuits by the Stoker estate the film company had to declare bankruptcy and evades the lawsuits altogether. Grau had the idea to shoot a vampire film during his wartime experiences. During the winter in 1916 a Serbian farmer told Grau that his father was a vampire and an Undead. Of course this gave Grau several ideas for movies. On Nosferatu he was not only the producer but he was also the production designer and responsible for how the entire film and characters look.Henrik Galeen was sought after and wrote the screenplay for the film. He was especially experienced in dark romanticism and had worked on other screenplays. He set the story in a fictional North German harbor town named Wisborg. It was also his idea for the vampire to bring a plague to Wisborg when rats follow Nosferatu off the ship from which he lands in the harbor. It was his decision to leave out the character of Van Helsing, the vampire hunter.The film is very engaging for 1922. The establishment of the alternate vampire that came to be known as ""Dracula-type"" this more rat-like depiction is very believable. This adaptation of Dracula is as positively hailed as the original Dracula itself. The movie is in public domain and because of that most of the copies of this film are of poor quality though it is easy to find the film. There are some very nice quality of film in release and it is well worth it to view one that is high quality so as not to miss any of the fine details of the film.The film was remade in 1979 by German director Werner Herzog. Like all remakes that film is a film unto itself and should not necessarily be compared though it is also worth time to be viewed. Nosferatu is a part of film history but aside from what grade history may give, the film is scary and well made. It is a wonderful film and Max Schreck as Count Orlok is terrific to watch.",Nosferatu
192,Tommy-5,Early Horror Classic,9,11 July 2006,"1922's Nosferatu is one of the early classics of horror cinema. Directed by the great German director F.W. Murnau, this film uses lighting and lack of sound to its distinct advantage. I've read that the Bram Stoker estate nearly succeeded in having all of the prints of this film destroyed. All fans of classic cinema should be grateful that this did not happen.What interests me about silent era films is that they are so old now, one gets a sense when viewing them of looking back into the past through the lens of a fiction film. Nosferatu is the standard Dracula story and reminds much of 1932's Vampyre in style and tone. I'm not going to critique the story too much as most readers already know it, but would like to offer comments concerning this version.Max Shreck as the vampire distinguishes this film from the countless other Dracula and vampire films that have been produced through the years, for in most the vampire is normally portrayed as handsome and debonair, a creature that one almost wishes will wind up in the heroine's bedroom. But, Max Shreck is garishly tall, long-fingered and bald in the ugliest way, looking more like an over-sized gnome than the elegant Dracula we are familiar with. One has to watch closely as Shreck becomes progressively uglier as the film progresses, a very subtle suggestion to the viewer of the deterioration of his life and psyche. Murnau uses rats throughout the film to tie them to the presence of the disturbing vampire. The scene on the boat where he emerges from the ships' hold is perhaps the most frightening in screen history. Nothing has topped it in the 84 years since it was filmed. Credit Murnau for this.Much of Nosferatu was filmed on location in villages and old buildings, again reminiscent of Vampyre. In the use of lighting and camera angles, one gets the idea that Murnau and Carl Dreyer were cinematic soul mates. I have always maintained that some films are better made in black and white, and after viewing Nosferatu again before preparing this review, I am also convinced that some films, even today, would benefit from limited dialog and, in some cases, total silence. One wonders what Nosferatu would have been had it been a talkie? Perhaps still a classic, but the images of Shreck as Nosferatu benefit from the mind having no external stimulation such as background music or dialog. 1979's Nosferatu with Klaus Kinski, while not a bad film, simply does not give us an insight into what Murnau would have done with sound technology for this masterpiece.One thing is a bit different in this version than in others. The story goes that, to destroy the vampire and the effects he has had on his victims, he must be in the company of a female virgin early in the morning when the cock crows. I don't want to offer a spoiler, here, but pay careful attention to Nosferatu's ending. It is a brilliant piece of camera work and is a wonderful ending to a great film.",Nosferatu
193,Rueiro,"A very beautiful, and often underrated film.",10,29 May 2012,"This is one of the most famous films of all time, the oldest surviving vampire film in the world, his director's most famous work, one of greatest and best known films of German Expressionism, and without question, one of the best horror films ever made and which set the standards for all the vampire films that have been made ever since. I know that many people are immediately put off by the fact that it is a silent film, but I would ask them to put that prejudice aside for ninety-three minutes, and give it a try. They eventually may not like it still, but still they got nothing to lose. In order to watch ""Nosferatu"" with a keen eye and to appreciate it in full as it deserves, some previous research is essential. Yes, it is an adaptation of the novel ""Dracula"", and as to why the names both geographical as well as the characters' are German in some editions, the answer is that Murnau and his producer didn't acquire the copyrights of the novel for purely financial reasons, and they thought they could make a pirate adaptation and get away with it. They did the first thing, but didn't achieve the second, for Bram Stoker's widow sued for plagiarism when she heard of the existence of ""Nosferatu"", and the court ordered all the existing copies to be destroyed without question. Fortunately a few survived, and by the Thirties, after the death of Mrs. Stoker, the ban ceased to be and the film could be publicly screened again. But the copies shown to the public had been chopped down to sixty-five minutes, leaving a film filled with massive plot holes and discontinuity that weighted it down terribly and caused the negative feelings that many spectators still feel about it. I myself experienced that when I acquired a VHS copy recorded from some TV channel, with English subtitles translated into Spanish by a voice-over, in plain black and white with lots of dirt spots in the negative and a murderous visual quality. Still, that was the only way to watch it before the arrival of DVD technology. Then ten years ago I attended a screening at the Curzon Soho cinema on the 80th anniversary of the film, and there I saw the restored ""Nosferatu"" for the first time, noticing the immense difference that the original 93 minutes make to the film. Not only everything makes now much more sense, but we can see that, except for minor changes in the action, the film is one of the most faithful adaptations of Stoker's novel. To me personally it also is, with Terence Fisher's ""Dracula"" of 1958, the best adaptation ever made to this day. Still, viewers ought to be aware that there are several different editions on sale on DVD, with prices varying between five pounds and twenty, and not all of them are the restored version. Obviously, the cheaper ones are just copies of the old VHS, so here we go back to the same problem we used to have in the past. The reason for this is that ""Nosferatu"" nowadays belongs to the public domain, which means anyone can edit a copy and put it for sale without infringing any original copyrights. This is what a few video companies just have done, recycling the old material they already had, regardless to quality and to the fact that they are selling only two-thirds of the film. Other editions bring the full-length cut, but still they present other deficiencies such as plain black and white cinematography -the original negative by Murnau was tinted- and the wrong soundtrack. I watched one of those versions once, which had an electronic score with vocal sounds in the background that would be more typical of modern slasher films and sounded absolutely terrible in ""Nosferatu"". To my knowledge, the only version to watch for someone who is looking for the real thing and wants to own a piece of film history, is the one available in the ""Masters of Cinema"" series, restored by the F.W.Murnau-Stiftung foundation and the film scholar Luciano Berriatua. It comes with the original tinted print, the original 1922 score and the original inter-titles design, as well as a long documentary on Murnau and a book that analyses the film thoroughly. It is not cheap, certainly, but it is the definitive ""Nosferatu"" DVD if you love the film like I do. For first-time viewers who want to have a go at it, I would suggest to watch it in the Internet first. But again, avoid any version under 90 minutes if you want to see the real film.",Nosferatu

What is interesting to know is that this movie was actually mean't to be a movie adaptation of the classic Dracula novel, but the couldn't get the copyrights to the novel so the change the name of every one, but kept the same storyline. The only problem with a silent movie is that I can't critic the music. Even though It has music on the DVD it was all added in by the computer. Well the version I saw had good music. Another thing about silent films is that you can't really say any thing about the acting. So lets just say that the faces match the emotions.

People can't really use their imagination anymore, which is a good thing to use when you are watching a silent movie. However, I try my best, and I really enjoyed this movie. It has a really creepy atmosphere, and even though it's more than 90 years old, it still had some creepy camera angles and shots. I can't imagine how creepy this movie was back in 1922, because it still is a little creepy now. Not scary, just creepy. I really liked the music that was playing throughout, because it really enhanced the movie. The whole time the music was playing I was enjoying the movie. Which means I enjoyed the whole movie. Max Schreck did such a good job at being creepy that I completely admire him, even though he's dead. Everyone else in this film did a wonderful job. Even the extras played a believable part. Also, I think the makeup artists did an absolutely wonderful job on the whole entire cast. Count Orlok (Max Schreck) looked really creepy and real. I even thought that was a real person's face until I took a good look at it, and realized that would be impossible for someone to have teeth like that. Also, the costumes are made so well that I believed they were real clothes and not just costumes. Now on to the general aspects of the movie. I really enjoyed the wonderful acting, well, wonderful for the time, and the effort put into playing a believable character really made me happy. The special effects were very rare, but when they did appear, they were very good. I have no idea how they could make things disappear and reappear with the so limited technology of the time. I could tell they used stop-action for some of the door opening effects, or maybe even string, but it was done in such a way that it was enjoyable. The story line was loosely based on Bram Stoker's Dracula, so it was really entertaining, and somewhat original because the makers shifted some stuff around. In fact, the only reason I don't give this a 10 is because it was kind of hard to follow. Now, that is probably because I took a break while I was watching it, but it might not be, so don't dislike this review because I said it was kind of hard to follow. OK. I was trying to figure out why some things happened and why some things did not, but I still understood the movie 100% by the time it was over. Don't judge! I still really loved this movie though, and it really irks me that some people don't take the time for silent movies. That's really all I have to say. So thanks for reading. See ya!",Nosferatu
197,kriitikko,The Grandfather of all vampire films,10,9 May 2008,"About 10 years after the death of Bram Stoker, a German filmmaker F. W. Murnau became interested in adapting Stoker's most famous novel, a vampire story ""Dracula"", as a motion picture. However, Stoker's family was not interested in selling the rights to film the book and legally the film should never have been done. Murnau did not give up but with a screenwriter Henrik Galeen made some changes to the story line and characters.Set in the 1830's Germany, a real-estate agent Thomas Hutter(Gustav von Wangenheim) receives a job from his boss Herr Knock(Alexander Granach) to travel to Transylvania and sell a house from their town to an eccentric nobleman Graf Orlok(Max Schreck). As Hutter travels through the Transylvanian countryside towards Graf Orlok's castle, the local villagers express unexplainable fear whenever hearing Hutter mentioning his destination or Orlok's name. Hutter receives a strange book from one of the villagers that tells about Nosferatu, an undead creature that sleeps in graves during daylight hours and feeds on the blood of the living people during the night. Refusing to believe in such stories Hutter continues to the castle of the vampire lord. Meanwhile back in Germany, Hutter's young wife Ellen(Greta Schröder) starts to sense something dreadful approaching.As a film Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror) is the grandfather of all vampire films. There are numerous elements in this film that have been passed to other vampire films and that can be found even in the very newest films. Such elements as vampire dying in sunlight, vampire's obsession of a young woman, local villagers living in fear, a young man accidentally cutting a wound to his finger and making vampire behave strangely, and many, many other things. This film also started the long lasting tradition in Dracula adaptations to cast the weakest actor in the movie in the role Harker, Hutter here. Unlike his many successors though, Gustav von Wangenheim is not a stone face bloke, but an annoyingly overacts his reactions throughout the film.Murnau, who in his most early films already showed a great love towards nature and surroundings, wanted to film on actual locations and he does an excellent work with his photographer Fritz Arno Wagner. The little town in the beginning delivers a kind of dream like atmosphere that turns into a nightmare later when vampire brings death and destruction with him. The majestic takes of Carpathian Mountains and Graf Orlok's castle have an eerie feeling around then, almost like from an another world. The castle with its doors opening and closing by themselves and bats flying around its towers has been an inspiration to many later Gothic castles in films.The most memorable aspect in the film however, is the vampire itself. The monstrous bald headed and long fingered Graf Orlok differs greatly from the Count Dracula of Stoker's novel, but not in a bad way. Orlok does not appear as just another version of Dracula but is a completely own character. Although Orlok seems like a monstrous missing link between a bat, a rat and a human, and only brings death and misery wherever he goes, he does have some tragic elements in him also, that the actor Max Schreck manages to subtly perform from under his makeup. Orlok is not the kind of vampire to appear to maiden's window and seduce her to drink her blood. He does not have any appeal or hypnotic powers in him. He has to take what he wants, for no one will give it to him voluntarily.Unlike in Stoker's book and many later adaptations of Dracula, the film is not build around the fight between vampire and the crew of men hunting him, but between a vampire and the woman he desires. Greta Schröder, though somewhat theatrical, makes a good performance as a woman who, in order to defend all the she holds dear for herself, must allow the devil to have what he wants. The finale in the film in many ways is actually more dramatic than that of Stoker's book. The film also has its own Van Helsing- type of character, Professor Bulwer(John Gottowt), but his role is so small in the film that he is not even necessary character here.All in all, even if the film may not seem much to the present day audience now, over 80 years after its production, it is still in many ways impressive to watch, not only as the first memorable Dracula adaptation, but also as maybe the most important vampire film ever made.",Nosferatu
198,Foux_du_Fafa,Eeek! Vampires!,10,8 July 2008,"Having recently seen this as part of a university module on film from Germany's Weimar era, I can safely say that ""Nosferatu"" is one of the best films ever made, especially from an atmospheric and cinematographic point of view. The film is suggested by Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" - I say ""suggested by"" as opposed to ""based on"", as whilst the premise is the same, the names of the characters and the story's general tone are changed to something more Germanic. Perhaps even more so than the influence from Stoker, ""Nosferatu"" is equally influenced in a number of aspects by German Romantics ranging from Caspar David Friedrich to E.T.A. Hoffmann and the Brothers Grimm. Thus, the vampire seems more of a folkloric figure from within one of the darker moments in a fairy-tale from Grimm than Stoker's did, and the relocation of the time period and setting is to Germany during the Romantic era (no less).The film succeeds because it incorporates aspects of fantasy-horror and Expressionism, yet at the same time uses realistic settings (often ""on location"") extensively; in comparison with the likes of ""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"", which were stylistic affairs confined to a studio. This creates a subtle spooky mood, which inhabits the viewer for a good while after the film is over, rather than provide quick short thrills that die as soon as the credits roll like with a number of horror films. This makes for an excellent film, which ought to be watched.",Nosferatu
199,carljessieson,"Amazing for its time, pretty good for today",7,25 March 2015,"Nosferatu is a 1922 German film directed by F.W. Murnau, written by Henrik Galeen, and starring Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, and Greta Schröder.Liked it, didn't love it. There are so many times during horror films when I think of a smarter plan of action than the characters did, and this movie was just the same. I totally understand that it is a classic, and it definitely deserves to be. It's important to note the time this movie came from while critiquing it. Things in the film that may seem amateur now were ground-breaking back then. The film unfolded in a somewhat confusing manner. Something I've noticed about watching these earlier films is that the pacing is strange. It will be moving incredibly slow and/or including scenes that weren't really necessary, and then things that should take a long time happen in a snap with no explanation. I know that's vague but when watching, be prepared for seemingly random behavior stemming from somewhat ambiguous motives. I thought I was having difficulty suspending disbelief, but you can only blame it on that so many times before you have to accept that the film just isn't filling in all the blanks. It was successful in creeping me out, that's for sure. Interesting enough but I did find myself ready for it to be over a while before it actually was. It has awesome special effects for 1922. There were interesting, creative angles. It is a classic for a reason, definitely, and I'll recommend it, I guess. Bechdel test: 0/1 Did not pass. Only one female character and her sole reason for existence was to worry about her husband and be in utter despair. Did I enjoy it? Yes. 1/1 Do I ever want to see it again? I would watch it again, yes. Do I ever want to include it in my own collection? It's already included but I don't think I would intend to buy it if it wasn't. 7/10 Bye love you -Jessie Carlson",Nosferatu
200,Joel I,Still the greatest,10,4 December 1999,"Nosferatu was made in 1922, and if there's been a better vampire movie in the last 77 years, I haven't seen it.  Don't be put off by the fact that it's silent.  If anything, that only adds to the creepy atmosphere (hearing Dracula speak would have made him less scarey).  The image of Max Schreck, as Count Dracula, rising from his coffin or climbing out of the hold of his death ship, is still sensational.  Even his shadow is terrifying, as brilliantly used by director Murnau.  The scene of his demise is haunting. Some of the narrative scenes between Dracula appearances are a bit melodramatic, but they don't detract enough to keep this from being the classic vampire movie.  Horror buffs, you can keep your special effects. Believe me, if you haven't seen Max Schreck as Dracula, you ain't seen nothing!",Nosferatu
201,johnnysugar,The standard for primal terror,10,6 August 2003,"F. W. Murnau's classic film ""Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie Des Grauens"", or ""Nosferatu: A Symphony Of Horror"" has appeared in many incarnations since its debut in 1922.  Some, like the 1979 remake ""Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht"" have been bold revisions, others, like the version featuring the debatable talents of goth band Type O Negative, have been painful.  But to explore why this is the standard by which all other vampire movies must be judged, one must look to the original.The plot is simple.  Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim), a real estate agent, is contacted by Knock (Alexander Granch), and odd man and servant to Count Graf Orlok (Max Schreck).  The Count would like to buy a house in town.  Hutter travels to the Count's remote castle, where he encounters a hideous and disturbing man.  Orlok travels back to town, where he falls in love with Hutter's virtuous wife Ellen (Greta Schroder), meanwhile bringing death and the plague with him.  It is, of course, and adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"" with the names changed, the narrative stripped to its essentials, and virtually all secondary characters removed.Many people doubt that a movie made 80 years ago, without the graphic wizardry of modern technology, could be anything near frightening.  This is far from the truth.  The terror inherent in the film rests almost entirely on Schreck's stooped shoulders.  Orlok is a vile and frightening thing, a creature whose inner darkness and insaitable want have been epitomized in its grotesque features.  The silent nature of the film works wonders with this, as one cannot imagine a voice hideous enough to match the Count's twisted form.  Orlok is not the suave, refined, mildly campy vampire of Bela Lugosi or even Gary Oldman.  He is a primal monster, born of nightmare and fear.Despite Orlok's amazingly chilling performance, one cannot forget the direction of F. W. Murnau, who provides sets and angles that uniquely convey the dread inherent to the vampire's threat.  His linking of Orlok to the plague is particularly interesting, as the plague contains all of the terror and chaos of the vampire itself, but it is a wholly natural phenomenon.  The organ score heightens the mood even further, but the score on the most recent DVD release by the Silent Orchestra is just as good as a layered, multi-textual alternative.In a cinematic landscape where a horror film is judged on the amount and extreme nature of graphic killings displayed, many may see ""Nosferatu"" as a relic or even worse, as a bore.  Yes, the acting may seem overdone, and the special effects are certainly primitive by modern standards.  But the essence of ""Nosferatu"" is how it can distill the most ancient form of fear into a film, into one horrible, terrifying character.  For this reason alone, it is a must for any fan of cinema, and certainly required viewing for any horror fan.  10 out of 10.",Nosferatu
202,pitsburghfuzz,My thoughts on Nosferatu...,8,5 August 2009,"When i first heard about this movie and what it was about, i thought i was about to pee my pants when i saw it. It is often hailed as among the greatest(if not the greatest) symphony of horror"" of all times(pun intended). The movie is basically ""Dracula but with different names(if you want to know why it is all over the internet). Anyway, the movie succeeds in fascinating. The angles and shots were pretty cool and the scenes are memorable, such as Count Orlok(Dracula) ascending the stair case. Some of the horrors i was expecting were not terrifying for modern audiences. The major thing that made me mad was cop-out ending. Like Dracula(1931), which is often considered to be the greatest Dracula, had that same weakness. Although i was slightly disappointed, Nosferatu is a movie everyone should see, like Godfather, Casablanca, ETC. Watch it give your own opinion on this ""symphony of horror"".",Nosferatu
203,aeowen-03398,A Rarity,10,31 March 2019,"I had heard of this movie in undergraduate school back in the early 90s, and the rarity was very few if any prints were saved due to Bram Stoker's estate threatening plagiarism over the storyline; thus, Dracula became Orlok.So here almost 25 years after graduation, I had totally forgotten about it until an old friend called and just ranted on about something being there and had I seen it. Curious, i asked him what the excitement was...and he told me this movie finally made it on YouTube!Watched it, loved it! Love the music so much!

No offense to old movies (I like them, personally), and no offense to Max Schreke, who really did a good job of portraying creepy-vampire-man, but ""Nosferatu"" sucked.After reading the book Dracula on which this was based (yes, it says in the opening credits that it's based on Dracula), I am absolutely appalled that this is hailed as a masterpiece of horror cinema. The exaggerated acting (while understandable) is annoying and really destroys that suspension of disbelief with the silly faces that only succeed in making you laugh.It truly mangles the book; Mina Harker has become Nina Harker. Arthur, Lucy's husband, becomes simply Westenra. Lucy doesn't sleepwalk, but Mina/Nina does. Renfield is an agent as well as a mental patient. Van Helsing and Dr Seward are barely involved at all. And Dracula dies immediately after biting Mina/Nina for the first time, with no aid from the others (he gets burned by sunlight)! They even misspelled Jonathan Harker as JonathOn Harker. Come ON, people.All I can say is, this film truly destroyed my belief that old movies were the better movies. It's too incorrect to be an adaption, and it's too boring to be scary. The best thing that can be said about Nosferatu is that the bad silent acting will have you rolling in the aisles.",Nosferatu

It may be a bit tiresome to watch if you are not used to reading all the dialogs (which come rather sparingly) but it has a lot of dark spirit in it.The effects used in this movie are stunning for the time and through there crudeness (seen with todays eyes) become even more spooky! Many times will the viewer have to understand the contents of conversations from what the actors are doing on the screen, so not everything is spoken out, even if you at times would wish for more clarity... but things just are that way now and I would feel out of place to truly criticize this movie for not being clear enough.Max Schreck is most certainly the king of terrifyingly looking vampires on screen. If I had to chose between being bitten by him or by the Christopher Lee vampire, I would feel more comfortable around Christopher! He'd just be that tad more charming in a way.The cracking of the music is just another thing that adds to the flair of oddness and the scenes with landscape are just as fitting in the movie as all the rest is.Highly recommended for all vampire or old movie fans!9/10",Nosferatu
206,gring0,Seminal but flawed,7,20 January 2012,"Those who rate this film a full 10/10 do film criticism a disservice by lowering standards so low. While containing powerful scenes that remain landmarks in film history and have seldom been matched, the film itself is overlong (I have just seen the 85 minute version at the town cinema here in Germany) and, at times, incoherent. The acting alone is a major flaw and makes one question how anyone could overlook the stilted mannerisms and over-acting to describe this as a masterpiece. The stop-motion may have been revolutionary at the time, but it seriously dates the film. Where the film retains its value is in the context. Made three years after the Great War, Nosferatu can be seen to represent a Germany that was untouched by the battles but saw its population decimated by a hidden killer courtesy of the British blockade which saw perhaps as many as 750,000 die of starvation-related illness. Soldiers returned home to a familiar landscape but with everything upside down courtesy of the revolution and constant assassination and coup attempts.

208,homer_simpson91,An excellent movie,9,1 November 2001,"This is by far the greatest vampire movie ever made, and one of the best horror films, if not the very best, of all time. Nosferatu, or Count Orlok, is, in my own opinion, the creepiest and coolest looking movie ""monster"" I've ever seen. Freddy Kruger, Hellraiser, the Frankenstein's monster, none of them hold a candle to the vampire played masterfully by Max Schreck.To say that Max Schreck steals the show would be an understatement. Max Schreck played the role Nosferatu incredibly. Even after almost 80 years, Nosferatu is still scary, disgusting, mysterious and fascinating all at the same time, all thanks to the perfect performance by Schreck.F.W. Murnau does an excellent job as director of this film. The atmosphere and artistry he created in this film is what helped make it the classic it is today. I believe this is the first film in which two events happening at once are intercut. This is a common routine among movies now, but it's Murnau that helped pioneer it using this film.The only flaw I noticed watched this movie was the acting of Gustav von Wangenheim. I understand that for silent films like this one, a little overacting might be necessary, but I found Gustav to be annoying and distracting, and not very convincing at all in his role. He overacted WAY too much, and the fact that it's a silent film can't be used as an excuse for it. Max Schreck gave a brilliant performance, and Greta Schröder did a good job too, so there is no reason Gustav couldn't have.This tiny flaw hardly dampers the experience of this movie, however. It is definitely one of the best I've ever seen, and although it probably would not make my Top 10 list, it certainly makes my Top 20. This movie is highly recommended, not just horror movie fans, but for fans of movies in general.",Nosferatu
209,aakash-karkare,Nosferatu,8,24 November 2010,"Nosferatu was the first horror film. It was the first vampire film. It also has a wide number of admirers from Roger Ebert to Werner Herzog. It is adapted from Bram Stoker's Dracula. For some reason it is one of the few films from the silent era that still has a wide following. Nosferatu gives us an image of the vampire. We see him as a lonely man. We see him as sad. His wealth has no real value for him. The movie begins with a traditional love story but the way Murnau depicts it gives it beauty. The flower scene is very beautiful and later where the woman asks him "" Why did you kill the lovely flowers?"" juxtaposes the two scenes well. Murnau said that in the future there would be a lot of use of camera angles to tell a story. He says people will film thoughts and that is what Murnau does throughout the movie. He is filming thought. The shots of the seas, stormy and calm, the beautiful shot of the Venus Fly trap and various other similar shots. You can see how much Herzog was influenced by Murnau's style of storytelling.Visually this film is out of this world. It has tremendous beauty to it. Maybe because films in the silent era had to concentrate more on the visual aspect then the dialogue and plot lines but I don't think we would see such a movie today.I love watching these old movies. They have such simplicity to them and in that simplicity lies much of their charm. The scene of Nosferatu just behind that barred window is typical of this simplicity. I think it has to be watched a couple of time for it to sink in if you are new to silent film as I am. Some scenes hold more meaning when you see them as a whole and look more beautiful after the first viewing.The music is quite beautiful and if goes with mood perfectly. There is not a misplaced note in the score and I think the score is a work of art in its own right.Nosfeartu is one of Murnau's masterpieces and is a landmark of the silent era. Made almost a century ago it is still relevant as a film today. Maybe the plot has aged a little but that is not a problem. But visually the film can be watched and re watched.",Nosferatu
210,GingerStarWarsnerd,A true masterpiece that was very groundbreaking for the time,8,6 August 2019,This is a true horror film. Psychological thriller that kept you entertained. The storyline was interesting but a bit slow at times. It was a tad cheesy since it's an old film. The shadow of Nosferatu made the movie creepy as well as his whole appearance. Very well done for a nearly 100 year old film. I hope it still ages well years to come.,Nosferatu
211,Jamie-58,Erratic but good,7,11 October 2000,"Okay, it was rude of the film makers not to consult Florence Stoker about the use of her late husband's book to make this film. She was entirely within her rights to have the whole thing consigned to the flames, though even a cursory look at the worst prints in circulation reveal what posterity would have lost had she succeeded. At its best this is an extraordinary achievement, and its a pity that its many fine qualities went largely unappreciated in 1922 - and for some time thereafter.However there is no point getting bogged down in false veneration. Nosferatu has some glaring flaws which reduce its status from the towering masterpiece it is purported to be. The cinematography is often crude, even by 1922 standards. The script robs Stoker's story of its grandeur and blatant eroticism - there is a brief nod to the latter only in the final scenes. In place of sex the director has placed pestilence, which may or may not be an asset, depending upon your stance. Of much of the acting, well, the less said the better, and some of the special effects are frankly risible. Compare the journey from the Borgo Pass to that in Tod Browning's Dracula, made only nine years later, to see how inept parts of Nosferatu can be.On the plus side one has to applaud a film that maintains its terror and stark imagery almost eighty years after its release. At its best Nosferatu is that rare creature, a truly frightening and disturbing horror epic. It is a triumph of design, and the attention to detail is overwhelmingly impressive. Max Schreck manages to deliver a performance that is aided and abetted by makeup, but whose real impact derives from its sinister restraint.A mixed bag, then, something it has in common with its 1931 Hollywood remake. I know I swim against the critical tide when I say I prefer the latter, but that is not to deny the power of this film.",Nosferatu

213,Diego_rjc,Expected more. Much more.,7,24 January 2010,"'Nosferatu' came out on a very disturbed time for the world history. Germany had lost the war only three years earlier, and because of this fact that the 'German Impressionism' cinema movement began. In this movement, lots of important movies came out that redefined genres, created genres, and influences film-making up to today. 'Nosferatu' is one of the most famous pictures of this time, along with 1919's 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari', 1927's 'Metropolis' and 1931's 'M'. This movie is loosely based on Bram Stroker's Dracula, and it's the first adaption of the famous novel. But I really don't like the way the story was presented here. It isn't told well, and looks a bit confusing. The titles are too vague, and they don't really explain what's going on. This is one of these movies in which you don't really care what's going to happen. The plot is about a house salesman that is sent to Transylvania in order to sell a house to Count Orlok. The Count buys the house, but only because he is interested in the Count's wife. After this point, the story turns into something weird, and nothing like 'Dracula'. That's why I think it's unfair to compare this with 'Dracula' (although I do prefer the 1931's version of 'Dracula', but as I said...). The acting is really the main reason this movie is so famous. The supporting cast is all excellent, but it's the main part that steals all your attention. Max Schreck is absolute perfect as Count Orlok. He provides a haunting, yet serious and scary interpretation. There's even one movie in which the matter of him been a true vampire is discussed (2000's 'Shadow of the Vampire').The other aspects aren't really worth mentioning. F. W. Murrau's directing is okay for 1922, so is the rest. The titles are well made, but confusing. One thing that really bothered me was the blue and yellow tints to represent night and day, but this is not a problem only with this movie. Lots of 1920's silent movies utilize this resource.Overral, this is a mice movie, with an excellent acting, but a confusing and bad-told story. From its period, I prefer much more the also German 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'.7/10",Nosferatu
214,Greekguy,"A gem of early horror, but its setting can sometimes vary.",7,29 March 2013,"Clarification is required – when we talk about this film, we are talking about three different things: a discrete work of art, a cultural phenomenon and a viewing experience. Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin.Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain.However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schröder as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means ""fright"" or ""fear"") as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles. As for exterior locations, the quaint Hanseatic towns of Lübeck and Wismar give the film added authenticity and period charm.Is it scary? Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's ""Vampyr"", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's ""Shadow of the Vampire"", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living – and dying – with ever since.",Nosferatu

His appearance alone is enough to frighten anyone approaching his castle. Schreck's body language is so unorthodox that, it too, becomes unnerving. The cinematography of the film is superb, whether you see it in black and white or with the color lenses applied. The color being used to aid in the development of mood. Murnau's pacing of the movie also adds to the overall effect of the film, seeming to tow the line between slow enough to create tension and quick enough to prevent you from losing interest.

217,bjhadse,"The Most Accurate, Most Unsettling Dracula to Date",9,15 September 2011,"Anybody familiar with Stoker's ""Dracula"" (from which this film is blatantly lifted) already knows the story. Hutter (aka Harker) travels to Transylvania at his employer's request in order to finalize the sale of an estate to Count Orlok (aka Count Dracula). He is held prisoner at the Count's decrepit, ruinous castle (drained nightly of blood), which he narrowly escapes with his life. Now, injured and feverish, he must make his way back home to warn his beloved Ellen (aka Mina) of the creature which now stalks her. The film is notably more accurate than the official (and canonical) 1931 adaptation with Bela Lugosi (which is primarily taken from a 1924 theatrical adaptation of the novel).I have yet to find a more unnerving villain (vampire or otherwise) than Count Orlok (Max Shreck). Unlike Bela Lugosi's suave and charismatic Dracula or Brad Pitt's (sym)pathetic Louis, Shreck's Orlok is completely inhuman. His appearance alone is revolting: long, bony fingers ending in talon-like nails - white-washed pale face - pointed ears - dark, sunken eyes - rat-like fangs centered in the very front of his mouth (indeed, rats were the bestial motif of choice in the film, spreading plague throughout Germany after Orlok's arrival -- a fitting metaphor for vampirism itself). Orlok moves with expressionistic intent: jiltingly, stiffly and unnaturally.The scenes in which he moves across a ship's deck (backdropped by white sails) or where his imposing shadow (gnarled hand outstretched) creeps up a staircase toward Ellen are among the film's most memorable and most frightening. Fans of Dracula (the novel, the films and the cultural icon), vampires and expressionist films will find this highly-stylized feature an unnerving and truly frightening masterpiece.",Nosferatu
218,JackBenjamin,Horror,9,23 March 2009,"The images in this film are deeply frightening. Modern depictions of the vampire, at the behest of the studios no doubt, are of handsome, charming gentlemen who, even when they shift at night to monster form, retain grace and appeal. Nosferatu is a horror.I think the best way to approach art is, in Harold Bloom's terms, to read it outward from within. There's a danger in trying to see a work in a social context because you're starting from a false focal point, one you've yourself ordained as critical. That said, I think it's hard to read any film that came out of 1922 Germany outside the context of WWI. One of the most meaningless, mindless, devastating events in human history, and Murnau is very much the Nosferatu who rose from the grave to tell the tale of those undead, survivors in a changed world -- after all, how could life ever have been the same after the war; no, it must assume some new, unspeakable, unnatural and abominable form.The meek beast notwithstanding, other memorable images for me include that establishing shot of the ship at sea (I don't think I've seen this imitated since, which is surprising); the clever intercutting of Ellen's sleepwalk with the trolling vampire a sea away; the shadow of his clawed hand crawling up her nightgown; the reverse negative of the frantic carriage; the fast-motion current of the nighttime river; the extreme longshot of the townspeople chasing the scarecrow (and Murnau's clever use of the iris to simulate a gargantuan setting sun) -- all images that play with the notion of time and how it manipulates nature and vice versa, which, to me, is the most intriguing aspect of the vampire myth.",Nosferatu
219,Dorkboss,One of My Favorite Horror movie,10,8 October 2018,"Nosferatu was originally was suppose to be based on the Bram Stoker's famous book known as Dracula, but the director F.W. Murnau, never had gotten the rights from Stoker's wife.The plot tells that Hutter has been given a task to go to Transylvania and meet Count Orlok so he can can sell him a property in town. Leaving his wife Ellen with her friends; he go and meets Count Orlok and while he sells him the property, he begins to feel something unusual about the Count.This movie is still one of the most iconic gothic horror film that anyone can enjoy. One big thing that I enjoyed from the film is that unlike horror movie of today where they use loud noise to scare you, this movie has a subtle quietness and I know that's common for silent movies, but it helps the atmosphere and it builds the creepy moments that make it enjoyable to watch and get scared of. Count Orlok is also great too, from the stunning makeup design to the creepy walk and moments, the Max Schreck did a well done performance where I found him so haunting. It's a memorable film that every horror fan can enjoy watching, it the type of film that set the perfect mood to watch on a late night and all the lights are out.",Nosferatu
220,fullthundermoon-36564,Quintessential Silent Cinema,10,17 November 2021,"Nosferatu is a most haunting film. Stunning! Filled with late night characters and eerie motifs - beautifully captured.

Early horror-talkies kept the exaggerated mannerisms, so the Frankenstein and Dracula catalogues never disappoint.",Nosferatu
221,bakchu,Be sure to get a good version,10,22 January 2005,"Well, much has been said regarding the greatness of this film, and it is true - it's an unforgettable masterpiece. But only if you get a version that is close to the original 1922 release. Over time, many poor prints were released. Large parts of the film were thought lost for a long time. In 1988, Enno Patalas was able to reconstruct nearly the whole movie based on an original print discovered in South America. Remarkable in this version is especially the restoration of the original titles and the tinting - yes, ""Nosferatu"" wasn't simply black and white originally! E.g. night scenes were tinted blue, the titles green. This looks very interesting and really adds to the atmosphere.For this restored version, new music was written by German composer Hans Posegga. The score - eery and full of memorable tunes - is in my opinion the best Nosferatu music as yet. Sadly, it isn't available on any DVD I know of, and even the German television that used to air it with the Posegga music seems to have switched to a different one.The DVDs one can currently get seem all to have rather poor English titles - poorly designed (the German ones are often artfully hand-written) and overly shortened. I saw a similar German version in cinema - the rough, simple titles felt like a considerable stylistic incongruity to me, knowing the original.",Nosferatu

While probably the least faithful to the novel of all the adaptions, this was the original, and in my opinion Max Shrecks portrayal of Count Dracula(or Count Orlock) is even more iconic than Bela Lugosi. It also led to one of the greatest endings of any spongebob episode ever. To put it simply Nosferatu is a must see for any horror fan, and has stood the test of time in ways that few other silent films have.",Nosferatu
223,BruddanChrist,No wonder it's a classic!,10,20 February 2008,"I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons. I mean, how could anybody actually enjoy a movie that could have been shot by a seventeen-year-old with a crappy camera? How naive I was...Nosferatu is an exercise in brilliant film-making. Murnau's heavy investment on the look of the film pays off. The film is fun to watch. The acting is over the top, which is necessary to avoid constant cuts to dialog cards. The music is great, too. Chilling and expressive without being overbearing.As Roger Ebert put it, this film is not as scary as it is haunting. There are no moments that make you jump, but there are parts that stick in your head. Nosferatu is a classic for a reason. Find out for yourself.",Nosferatu

225,AnDread_The_Blind,Disappointing and Ugly,7,7 October 2010,"What a disappointingly boring and ugly movie. I appreciate horror of all eras, from the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari on. I've read and enjoyed the original Bram Stoker novel, and seen many of the film incarnations. I felt as though I had been putting off this classic, but really I wasn't missing much. I'm afraid I'll have to fall in with the conventional view that the 1931 Tod Browning adaptation is the best. Coppola's version is more faithful to the novel, but has its own problems (though it is still enjoyable). I know it's going against convention to disparage this movie, especially as a horror fan, but I can't find reason enough to lie or convince myself that I'm mistaken here. My experience viewing was that unpleasant.There isn't much to praise this version of the Dracula story--the action drags, the shots are desolate and ugly, the people are ugly, and the story is boiled down to flat simplicity. The only points in its favor are the vampire make-up and creepy visuals, but those aren't enough to carry a film for me.I'll be honest and say that I find it hard to appreciate silent films. I suspect it has to do with the reliance on exaggerated over-acting and visual cues akin more to theater than modern film. And so I can understand why some people might enjoy this film for the strangeness/grotesquerie of the visuals alone. I just didn't find them interesting enough to carry the film the way those of a few silent classics did, as in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The Phantom of the Opera, and Metropolis.",Nosferatu

But, I actually liked it. A lot. For a black and white movie made in 1922 with no sound, it was an amazing movie. It was the first ever movie version of Dracula, and it had extremely wacky, over the top acting, which was highly entertaining. Although it was supposedly a horror movie, I though it was very comical and wild, but I mean that in a good way. It was extremely long, get it held my attention, probably more-so than the 30s Dracula with Bela Lugosi. All in all, it was really good, and a horror classic no doubt, that spawned a legacy like no other.",Nosferatu
227,aileencorcoran,Nosferatu,8,24 October 2015,"I did not watch ""Nosferatu"" by choice. One of the modules I picked for my first term this year in college is European Cinema, which started off with German Expressionism. ""Nosferatu"" was one of the films we had to watch, and it is, at least to me, one of the better ones.Directed by F.W. Murnau, one of the most highly acclaimed Expressionist directors, ""Nosferatu"" is an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, ""Dracula."" Stoker's widow was unimpressed with this, and asked for all copies of ""Nosferatu"" to be destroyed. Most were, but one survived, which is the print that people around the world have seen since 1922.Set in a small German town, a cheerful young real estate agent named Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is summoned by his shady employer, Knock (Alexander Granach), to Transylvania. He is to sell a house to the reclusive man known as Count Orloc (Max Schrek). Hutter obliges, leaving his beloved wife, Helen (Greta Schröder), pining for him at home. Hutter heads to Romania, where he is warned by locals and books of the occult that where he is heading is not safe. Not even when the carriage that is transporting him refuses to go any further sways his stubborn mind. Alas, it is only when he meets the strange Orloc that Hutter realizes things are not all well in the mountains of Transylvania. He cuts himself when eating a late dinner with his host, to which Orloc reacts with erotic flourish, ""your blood... your precious blood!"" Odd happenings occur at Orloc's castle, such as doors opening for the Count without him moving his hands, Hutter falling unconscious in a chair only to wake up with a peculiar mark on his neck. Most bizarre of all, is when Orloc proceeds to attack his guest on his first night, only for Helen to somehow know something is afoot, calling out her husband's name in a frenzy, distracting the vampire...Hutter eventually discovers that his host sleeps in a coffin, and after seeing him journey away to his new home, across the road from him and his wife, Hutter escapes and tries to make his way back home. Orloc manages to kill an entire ship, leading the people of his new town to believe that they are in the midst of a plague epidemic. This is not helped when Knock, Hutter's boss, goes mad, and starts killing small animals for their blood.Despite illness and overwhelming fear, Hutter gets home to his wife, telling her to not research into the events that are occurring. Alas, Helen finds out that the only thing that will stop the henous Orloc is if a good hearted woman gives her blood to him before the cock's first crow...As a horror film, ""Nosferatu"" is more chilling than scary. It showcases many human fears, both from the time period and today. There is an underlying sexual tone, perhaps due to Murnau's sexuality (he was openly gay), where the unusually flamboyant man is seduced against his will by a creature of undetermined gender. There is Helen; is she deprived of sex from her husband (which from the amount of kissing they do seems unlikely), or does she see her husband is conflicted and offers herself to Orloc for his freedom? There is the fear of the unknown, of being possessed. Losing control of oneself, of what can not be seen or unseen. Of sickness and death. Of love and war. ""Nosferatu"" may not be a scary film, but, in the words of Roger Ebert, it haunts us.8/10.",Nosferatu
228,worldsofdarkblue,This Is Definitely Not Hollywood,10,12 May 2006,"When the American industry got around to making it's vampire entry they must have felt that U.S. audiences needed their monster to be softened. What a difference between the two interpretations!While Hollywood was smart enough to cast an east Europe type (Lugosi) they lessened the dread factor considerably by dressing him up in formalwear and giving him no real teeth to speak of. Orlock has teeth and they look very, very sharp indeed. The hollywoodized Dracula looks less like a monster and more like a romantic leading man when contrasted to the Orlock character of this German film. No one will ever attach 'romantic' to their description of Count Orlock.Where Lugosi would attempt to convey his brand of menace by means of a penetrating, hypnotic stare and holding up his fingers, Shreck has no need of such staginess. Where 'Dracula' (1931) has fake, vaguely European sets, 'Nosferatu' (1922) is truly Europe. In it's silence Nosferatu feels more ominous than does Dracula, what with his slow, deep-voiced, stilted speech which seems contrived and even unintentionally funny at times (how often have comedians utilized it since?) And wolves and bats are far less creepy (almost noble by comparison) than are rats and spiders. Nothing noble about rats.I didn't set out to write a disparaging review of 'Dracula'. I've loved the Lugosi version since childhood, but when I saw 'Nosferatu' many years after numerous viewings of the Universal series I realized very quickly that the fear factor of 'Nosferatu' was leagues ahead of the American version, and frankly, I was initially dumbstruck by this fact. I would never have guessed that a silent-era horror film could be so much more striking than the films made over the next five decades!Whereas Hollywood gave us a fun, not very scary, but deservedly much loved movie classic, F.W. Murnau has given us a fascinating, visionary masterpiece of horror cinema. Students of film art will likely explore 'Nosferatu' more than once.",Nosferatu

You can watcha Weimar Republic era German film, and imagine that a little known political activist named Adolf Hitler is alive and well, and forming a new political party, The National Socialist Party. In 1922, Germany got a much needed infusion of foreign capital, much of it from the United States. Who knew that in seven years, the Great Depression would ruin Germany, and the rest of the world. Like Nosferatu, Hitler would thrive in the ruins of a broken nation, ""sucking"" the lifeforce of a country steeped in the myths of the Grimm brother's stories, full of cannibalistic witches, and enchanted forests. The themes of racial pollution and insidious forces destroying a nation from within are subtle, but evident. Was Nosferatu a metaphor for the Eastern European Jews who were swarming into Germany? A metaphor for Hitler and the Nazi party? Or a metaphor for the German Psyche?",Nosferatu

It is also the oldest surviving movie adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula although the names of the characters in the movie were changed due to copyright reasons. Nosferatu was actually considered lost for a long time because Prana Studios who distributed the film got sewed by Bram Stoker's widow and were ordered to destroy every copy of the film and it was thought that no copy of the film had survived. Luckily that was not the case and horror fans can still enjoy this cinematic master piece. The film tells the basic story of ""Dracula"" (a Transylvanian vampire buys a house from England...) but makes slight changes to the story and actually changes the way Dracula (or ""Count Orlac"" as the vampire is called in the film) is killed since in the Bram Stoker novel he is simply stabbed but Nosferatu invents an entirely knew and innovative weapon ""sunlight"". Its funny that what is considered to be one of the most well know facts about vampires and is a huge part of the modern vampire mythology is actually not from the Dracula novel but from the film adaptation. Being the original Dracula film Nosferatu is a must see and an essential film for every horror fan's movie collection. Watch it if you dare!",Nosferatu

241,HollywoodGlee,Nosferatu accompanied by German pianist Markus Horn,10,17 March 2016,"Viewed by Larry Gleeson at San Luis Obispo California State Polytechnical University's Spanos Theater as part of the 22nd Annual SLO Film Fest, formally known as San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.The complete 2006 digitally restored version of Nosferatu the surreal German Expressionist classic silent film by renowned director, F.W. Murnau, served as the Opening Night film for the 22nd SLO Film Fest with a new piano soundtrack performed live by German composer and pianist, Markus Horn. Most recently, Horn has performed his musical talents to another silent German film, Metropolis, directed by Fritz Lang. Interestingly, Horn created this composition in the Spanos Theater specifically for Nosferatu .Nosferatu, is similar in a stylistic vein to the classic example of German Expressionism, the 1922 silent film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with its use of unusual, odd-looking characters, geometric mise-en-scen and its abundant use of light and shadows in its storytelling. A storied production, Nosferatu, an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" was shot in 1921 and released the following year in 1922. It is very similar to ""Dracula,"" retaining its core characters of Jonathan and Nina Harker and the Count while omitting some of the secondary characters.Interestungly, a court ruling ordered all copies of the film destroyed after Prana Film, a short-lived, silent-era German film studio was unable to get the rights to the novel, was sued Bram Stoker's widow and eventually declared bankrupted in defending itself from copyright infringement. A few copies of the film survived as the studio undauntedly had gone forward with the production changing names and details from the original novel. For example, Count Dracula became Count Orlok, played brilliantly by Max Schreck (Schreck in German translates to terror, fitting for the roles Max Schreck undertook throughout his acting career) and the term vampire became nosferatu. In addition, Count Orlok doesn't create new vampires. Instead he killed his victims with the town folk blaming the deaths on a black plague. And, while Count Dracula was weakened by sunlight, Orlock sleeps by day as any exposure to sunlight would cause his death. In the end, Count Orlok meets his demise in drinking the blood of a young maiden, Mina, who sacrifices herself by allowing Orlok's copulation while enticing him to do so into the day's sunrise culminating in Orlok's death.Director Murnau prided himself on utilizing various angles in his productions and Nosferatu's cinematographer, Fritz Arno Wagner, delivers. Several shots capture the eye including a film ending low angle shot of a castle in ruin representing the demise of Count Orlok. In addition, several shots on board the ship of stacked wooden coffins and the frenzied scrambling of ship rats as a coffin is opened and its contents spilled become etched in memory.All this withstanding, the evening belonged to Markus Horn, as he mesmerized the audience with a soundtrack that brilliantly matched the photographic score in creating a dream like atmosphere for the minimalized intertitled narrative. Horn's intense symbiosis of film and music culminated in a rousing, standing ovation by an enraptured audience at the film's end.This version of Nosferatu with the Markus Horn accompaniment and a run-time of 94 minutes left the audience wanting more. Much more. An exceptional opening film. Highly, highly recommended.",Nosferatu
242,drsecond,"Great for its time, but....",7,14 December 2001,"I was a little disappointed with this film.  Pluses - The camera work was way ahead of its time, with some of the shots looking like scenes from modern horror flicks.  The music on the VHS version was amazing.  Minuses - Pacing on this film is quite slow, with extended scenes of people traveling. The film is about a 45 minute story stretched over 80 minutes.  For some reason, version I watched kept changing color of the black and white, i.e. some sections were reddish, others blue, others brown, and very occasionally grey.

243,FlaviusAetius,A nightmarish gem from the Expressionistic era of cinema,10,4 November 2006,"Many kids nowadays won't get this movie. They'll say it's stupid, boring, black and white, not enough sex, profanity, or violence to hold the attention of their rap-corroded brains. Indeed, this film isn't for everyone, not just the demographic above. But to the right sliver of viewers, 'Nosferatu' is a triumph.It's basically the classic plot of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', only with details changed. ( Count Dracula becomes Count Orlok, Harken becomes Hutter, and Orlok follows him back to Germany, not Britain.) Max Schreck completely steals the show. As he slinks through shadows, purses his hideous rodent features, moves like an animated corpse, and springs from his coffin and into your imagination, you never once gain a doubt that he isn't the freakish vampire you see. There is no charisma in 'Nosferatu', no sex appeal or eroticism. Count Orlok inhabits a realm of nightmares, not a realm of earthly evils. His appearance is alien, his behavior is inhuman, and his feats of power unholy. He can turn intangible in the movie and seems to be telekinetic as well. The special effects of 1922 are laughably outdated by todays standards, but the film does a remarkably good job of balancing what you see with what is going on. His coffin, assembling itself piece by piece into a cart at irregular intervals, is a surreal experience. It's distorted, fractured, bizarre, and crooked: far more terrifying than the way-too-real aesthetics provided by modern day CGI.This film is a classic and one that has long provided much examination to film students throughout the world. You can't call yourself a true connoisseur of film without having seen F.W. Murnau's magnum opus.",Nosferatu
244,ed_zeppelin,"Surreal, chilling, and beautiful",10,27 July 2006,"Whenever you see something described as ""instantly recognisable"", beware: it means that whatever it is has been spoofed/homaged/ripped off so many times that the original isn't what you actually recognise. Half the people who recognise Max Schreck's terrifying Count Orlock haven't seen the film at all, but have seen plenty of clip shows, parodies, or worse, Buffy The Vampire Slayer. In effect, certainly in this case, ""instantly recognisable"" means that worthy source material has become synonymous with and indistinguishable from the clichés that have followed in its wake.That's why on first viewing Nosferatu is interesting for all the shots that Schreck isn't on screen. Thomas Hutter, Professor Bulwerthese are all new characters, presented fresh for audiences eighty-five years on. The shots of Orlock rising from his coffin, lurking in his crypt  and, of course, coming up the stairs  are fantastically exciting, but only when the rest of the story is added are these moments validated and a truly great film is made.Nosferatu was made a score of years after Bram Stoker wrote Dracula (in fact his widow was still alive), and the vampire it gave us is now such a ubiquitous trope that it's easy to forget how comparatively recent it was, and that Nosferatu comes from a period when the imagery surrounding it was still being defined. The film dates from when something new was being brought to the table with every retelling of the story, and this film's major contribution to the tale is the idea that sunlight is fatal to vampires. Since technical limitations meant that scenes could only be shot in bright sunlight, in retrospect they were lucky to get away with it.But it works. F. W. Murnau was the king of German Expressionism in silent cinema, and the abstract, surreal and symbolic style of film-making makes a virtue out of necessity. Hand-cranked cameras mean that people move strangely  this is actually incorporated into the film here, to give characters a sense of grotesque distortion. Similarly the bright sunlight during what is supposed to be the middle of the night is used to give the feeling that time itself has been subverted in Orlock's realm, as the enigmatic figure disappears from one place and reappears in another without apparently travelling through the intervening space. All this contributes to Nosferatu's status as one of the most atmospheric and visually beautiful films of all time.Murnau died in 1931, around the time when silent films were being phased out in favour of talkies. This means that he will forever be associated with the style of cinema of which he was the undisputed master. He famously liked to use the visuals to tell the story, and to keep title cards to a minimum; as a consequence, the plot of Stoker's novel has been stripped to its bare bones. Once again however limitations and necessities are taken and turned into bonuses, as the plot here becomes a frame around the film. Expressionism was, after all, concerned with symbolism and suggestion rather than the purely literal, and it feels appropriate that the various milestones of the novel become mere points of reference here, starting places for it to divert away in its bizarre, frightening manner.These days, modern audiences find silent films increasingly difficult to get to grips with. It's understandable, but it's a shame. I haven't mentioned the poor quality of the film stock because it simply doesn't matter (in fact it adds to the evocative nature of the film by increasing the distorted effect), but common gripes don't end there. A common accusation is that silent films are badly acted, or that the comedies aren't funny. They are well actedjust in a different way. And they are funnyjust in a different way. They follow a different set of rules. But I need make no such excuse for Nosferatu, which remains as scary (if not more so) than any horror film I've ever seen, while remaining a beautiful, intelligent, literate piece of cinema. So put aside your preconceptions, if you have any, and forget about the silly spoofs. Just enjoy a film that's almost perfect on every level of its conception.",Nosferatu
245,Leahcurry,A beautiful but funny film,9,10 April 2000,"Let me first say that I like to watch horror and silent films. I had seen many ""Dracula"" movies before this one, but I didn't expect that ""Nosferatu"" was turn out being so unscary, and beautiful!However, the film has many flaws. First, it is much too long (80 minutes of slow pacing when it could have been much faster?). The film is set up much differently than the other versions, the final scenes in Bremen are short and run together, and are a disappointment. Next, ""Nosferatu"" was shot by day, and it is painfully obvious that most of the ""night"" scenes were shot in broad daylight.On a more interesting note, there is not much screen time for Dr. Van Helsing, Lucy, and Westenra. They are much less important. It is all right this way, but can be hard to accept at first.However, the use of classical music in the soundtrack is very effective for the most part (except at the end), making it more classical than scary. The look of the film is also marvelous. Dracula's castle is not as scary as in later versions, but it still gives a faint sense of menace.As all Dracula's go, this will not scare you. It is too beautiful to be suspenseful. Max Shreck as Dracula has a bald head and bat-wing ears. His appearance is unsettling, even funny, and was surely scary for 1922. But it is the least scary horror film I have ever seen, and when compared to other silent films and early '30s talkies (ex. ""The Cat and the Canary"", ""White Zombie"", the 1931 ""Dracula"") it is completely unscary. ""Nosferatu"" is proof that a horror film can be beautiful and more of a classic than a horror film.",Nosferatu
246,theBIGlebowskiD,"An classy, beautiful artsy version of the classic tale.",8,25 December 2001,"Nosferatu, a 1922 film of Dracula, as a matter of fact the very first vampire movie ever made, is a wonderful and beautifully artsy silent film. With the perfect music to back it up. It leaves you with a tear of beauty and truth. I loved it.",Nosferatu
247,metalrules31,The First Classic of Cinema,8,17 June 2008,"Nosferatu by F.W. Murnau, can be considered as being the first classic of cinema history. It dates back to 1922, the early history of the seventh art. If it wasn't for some serious research in order to obtain a full copy of this movie, then I would have to give this title to another film.It is true, this is the first silent black & white movie I have seen, but it was certainly a good starting point, and also a place I could recommend others to start from. Its story is simple; it is basically a summary of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the backbone of the story. It eliminates secondary characters or diminishing their roles in order to present the movie with few interventions of inter-titles.It is very fast moving, understandable and even though it dates back more than 80 years, it is still scary. This is mainly due to some great shots by F.W. Murnau and the amazing main character portrayed by Max Schreck. Some of these effects are yellow tinting for day, blue tinting for night, an amazing sound score and the genius negative shot.Max Schreck portrays Nosferatu. Murnau considered him quite ugly and just ordered ear and nose tips to be added to his make-up. Schreck does not blink on the whole movie, wears heavy clothes and always creates an aura of darkness and mystery whenever he is on screen. This can be finally seen on one of the final scene where the shadow of the vampire is seen walking up the stairs.All these and more, make of this film a great visual experience. This is probably the most significant release on the dark world of vampires since the before mentioned Bram Stoker's Dracula.",Nosferatu
248,Odysseus-5,Dust it off and watch - it's STILL damn good!,9,9 September 1998,"I'm a lover of classic horror and, let's say it... ""vampire"" films!  I had heard about the original _Nosferatu_ and when I saw it on Laserdisc in the movie store in the bargain bin, I decided then and there I had to have it. I have not regretted it since!  The eerie ambiance and unique (and disquieting) feel to Count Orlok himself give a whole different feel to the vampire - this first vampire is not just a nasty human with fangs, a bad sun reaction, and a predilection for a fake central European accent - this is a cunning and vicious inhuman creature who you can be afraid of!  While the story could be better (as is true of so many silent films) the stylish acting and the fantastic cinematography are what really make this film the classic that it is!  If you're used to the cinematographic stereotype vampire, do yourself a favor and see what else there is to see!",Nosferatu
249,linkan-3,Classic,10,18 May 1999,"Classic film. Great flick. Although I must say it's extremly grainy, if you know what I mean. Even for an old film from the 20's. And there are some weird stuff going on here:1. The vampire casts shadows and has a reflection. What sort of vampire is that?2. Nosferatu/Count Orloc gets killed at the end when sunlight hits him. But not long before that, he's out in broad daylight, walking around with his casket under his arm!3. Last, but absolutely not least, there is the geographic issue. It takes place in Brehmen, right? That is in Germany. And Ellen is waiting for her love Jonathan, who is traveling by boat, she's sitting on a beach looking out. So Jonathan is traveling from Transylvania, in Romania, to Germany, by boat! That's impressive.But still, a great film, and a true classic.",Nosferatu
250,sqrt_-1,Best vampire-horror ever! Still!,9,28 October 2001,After seeing a a fair amount of vampire type movies and other attempts at supernatural horror this is still the best ever! I have seen it 5 times by now which is a lot for me for a movie and a silent one at that! I am mad about the way this movie portrays the vampire as nothing other than an animal. No melodramatic human drama here. It is very effective in this way. The photography is great and one cannot help but be pulled into the story. I saw versions with different background music but one with Bach organ was the best. I will certainly freely recommend this movie to any lover of classic movies and rate it up there with 'Metropolis' and 'M'(Both by Fritz Lang). Enjoy late at night with a bottle of well matured Pinotage.,Nosferatu
251,azuremorningsky,the origin of the vampire flick,9,29 April 2010,"The first time i saw Nosferatu was when i was flipping channels late one Halloween night and stopped on TCM. I missed the very beginning but watched the movie all the way through. I have found that films i stumble across on accident are in many instances the best ones i ever see and Nosferatu is no exception. The film is a thinly disguised adaptation of the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker. It tells the story of a young naive real estate agent named Harker (in some translations) who unwittingly is sent to sell a house to the vampire Count Orlok. Orlok buys the house and travels to Harkers home town bringing with him a devastating plague. While the film is sometimes dismissed because of its being a silent movie, i would argue that the fact that it is a silent film makes it even scarier than if the film had sound dialog. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes dark films or wants to research early special effects.If you enjoy this film i would also recommend the remake of Nosferatu made in 1979 and a early sound vampire film called vampyr. This is just a little side note, but i have never seen Nosferatu with the same subtitles twice its really quite strange.",Nosferatu
252,Sarteshi,The beginning of it all.,10,27 January 2001,"Each and every horror movie produced after Nosferatu borrows some element from this film. From the slow, creeping soundtrack to the dark, sombre mood that permeates the movie, it is the best horror movie of all time.Some people say that it could be jazzed up with special effects and voices but this movie is a testament to what one really wierd guy with a video camera can do for the art of movie-making.",Nosferatu
253,trevorchamberlain-63352,The haunted screen,10,13 February 2020,"When Carl Jung came up with the concept of the collective unconscious, was he inspired if only obliquely by the movies, well perhaps, perhaps not? But cinema is a vision with the blinds down and once seen, belongs to your individual and our collective consciousness. Can any one remember a whole film, don't we know them in fragments, bits and scenes. Has any one watched a film to notice, what it is you don't remember, about the version that is playing inside your head. Just to make it more complete, is that what obsession is?Characters too, become unglued from their celluloid. Film stars become lovers or idols, friend or enemies. Woody Allen has imagined the star slipping off the screen and Humphrey Bogart offering advice to the love lorn and who that in your bed tonight, George Clooney or Brigit Bardot or both.They have their own adventures and continue their lives. As many as we can imagine. How distressing is it to simply know that Han Solo dies or that some one has written it. Poor chewie, I can remember thinking at the time, what's he going to do now? They live around us at work, at play.at home or where we can never be, sometimes just doing there own thing, is that Jack Nicholson hanging out with Ray Milland at the empty lounge bar? Nosferatu's Count Orlock belongs to the basement or maybe even the sub-basement of any imaginary world. In the darkness he stands nestled into an ached recess of the wall, almost forgotten in the shadows of this rarely visited room, he is waiting to catch your glance.There is something disquieting about the imagery of the F.W Murnau's film and of Orlock's place within it, something is not quite formed or fully worked out. Is he death, pestilence or waking nightmare or something we can not name, and so the figure slips across the frame and around our peripheral vision. This is where Nosferatu successfully haunts our imagination.Carla Laemmie lived long enough to reminisce with Mark Gatiss in 2010 about her part in the making of Dracula back in 1931, helpfully remembering the film as process. But Nosferatu is more distant then that. Murnau died in the year Dracula was made It seems to have always been there, with it's stiffened gait, with fingers switching, in image and in our imagination, in documentaries, on television, present and yet unknowable.Murnau's film very nearly didn't make at all. The story was illegally and very obviously borrowed from Brahm Stoker's novel Dracula. The author had died but his wife still held the performance rights and used this to have every copy destroyed. This proved to be elusive, hidden away from the sun light, in many dark boxes Nosferatu remained immortal. But at what cost, before the advent of dvd and now blue ray it seemed that the only remaining prints were third, fourth or fifth generation copies, beneath the scratches and spots the image looked decayed and at the very edge of corruption.Writing in Danse Macabe Stephen King mused that no matter how clearly you could see the zip up the back of the costume worn by the actor playing the monster. Waiting in the dark that night beneath your bed for that delicious moment to grab a leg or arm of any careless youth, is not a thing with any zip. Nosferatu seems to have already formed into that nightmare, the actor in make up has disappeared from the film as age and use has blurred its look. Nosferatu is simply some thing the camera has seen objectively like a chair or a tree and just as real. The proof that he was there is in the grain, But what is it, certainly not a simple reflection of sun light on the lens, he is a vampire after all. Is it not some form of corruption, a mold, a hideous growth upon the film. Nosferatu is a horrible nightmarish creation, unlike Dracula or Frankenstein, good old Bela and Boris, he refuses to become endearing or cuddly. You might give a child a bed time pizza face or Jason doll. However a really good likeness of Count Orlock ( something that catches the spirit) is still something you would not want to turn the light off on a child.Images from the film have stood for the genre in general. Nosferatu's shadow on wall is on the paperback English language front piece of Lotteh Eisner's The Haunted screen, the seminal work of expressionist cinema. He is there again creeping across the cover of Ian Roberts introduction to German Expressionist cinema, reminding readers that the genre would influence Citizen Kane, Sunset Blvd and film noir. Nosferatu the monster has slowly been gaining respectability in academic circles as a poster boy and calling card. However he had one last trick to play on audiences before he could be pined to his influences.Count Orlock is played by the popular German screen and
stage actor Max Shrek. The word Shrek
Means fear in GermanThat line or something very like it is in my large format colour illustrated edition of Horror films that I had back in the 1970s. That line or something like it was in another illustrated history borrowed from a friend, the local library had two more horror books giving the same information and why not. The information is factual and there are only so many ways of relaying it. All of these books are full of factual information on the industry and they agreed with each other. And they all agreed that Count Orlock is played by the popular German Screen actor Max Shrek. But there was a rumor that this wasn't true.Have you ever seen another film he has been in, do you know the name of any film he has been in? Have you ever herd of Max Shrek Before? Do you know what he looks like with out make up, have you ever seen a picture of Shrek? And that name, isn't it just a little bit to convent that Shrek means fear. Could this information, parroted in every publication have a single disputable source. I think this is the first time in my life I became worried about sources. The rumor was that Murnau in a desperate search for truth and originality had found someone who claimed to be a real Vampire and put him in the film (say! That's a good idea for a movie) Of course you don't have to believe in this for a moment to fall in love with the idea. I did not and I do.This was all long before the Internet and the mobile phone. Today Shrek's past history, personal appearance and film career come immediately to light. You can even watch some of his other films on the same device. Back then it would have taken a trip to a German film archive or museum to be sure. What could you do but speculate. What blew my mind back then was the duplicity of truth. That facts were not facts even if they were in black and white and printed everywhere, how sure could you be with what you are looking at. It's fitting that such a rumor should surround such an uncanny film and that Nosferatu freed from reality should be accorded a particular life of his own. Perhaps Lotteh Eisner was right with her title and the screen could be haunted after all.",Nosferatu
254,tobias_681,If you look beyond the shadows you might see something beautiful,10,13 October 2015,"This was the first silent feature film I ever watched. At the time it was obviously a little strange as I was only used to ""talkies"" however Nosferatu has haunted me ever since. I don't mean to say that I wake up at night, sweating and riddled with terror – however part of the movie stayed with me since then.Of course there are the technical aspects. Murnau had been a director for 3 years when Nosferatu was made, yet he commands the technical aspects like he'd been at it an entire lifetime. With him he has an entire toolbox full of visual devices: Deep focus (screw you Citizen Kane!), time-lapse, stop motion, shadow-plays, low angles, etc. And then there's the cutting compared to other movies made at the same time, the movie is actually cut quite fast. However it's not cut chronologically and some of the things make little sense seen only in the context of the story. For instance we are shown a random scene of a professor showing his students a flytrap when none of the characters features before or after. The narration is truly impeccable and entirely unique. It adds up better as a dream than as a story... Now the story, that's a peculiar case It's an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula which wasn't all that known back then. So the production team simply got at it without acquiring the rights. They changed a few names and settings, omitted a few characters and then went on to work with the story which stayed largely the same (one of the major differences is the ending of course). As it stands it's really simple: Graf Orlock (aka. Nosferatu) orders a guy named Hutter to his castle to sell him a house in Wisborg (a fictional German city). Hutter goes there but is captured by Nosferatu who travels to Wisborg and takes at Hutter's wife (obviously this is omitting some major plot points). While the movie resonated well with critics and audiences at the time, there was one major problem - Bram Stoker's widow was yet alive and apparently she wasn't very amused so she dragged the production company, Prana-Film, to court. Nosferatu became their first and last film and it was ordered to be destroyed. However that effort ultimately proved to be pointless as the film existed in too many copies already. So the film remained, Bram Stoker's novel received renewed interest (ultimately leading to a stage adaptation and the Lugosi film in 1931), Murnau became a big name and Prana-Film vanished.People like to talk about Nosferatu in relation to expressionism. Of course it makes sense given the cinematic movement at the time (German expressionism), Schreck's makeup, the dark theme, the connections to nature (e.g. the aforementioned flytrap) and Murnau's use of shadows. However personally I think it links much, much better to romanticism. For Nosferatu Murnau used mainly natural settings, shooting mostly on location (he even went as far as Slovakia for the exterior shots of Transylvania). He uses wide establishing shots, showing us nature which is either void of humans or renders them insignificantly small. The entire movie is in vein of a strangely melancholic mood that culminates whenever Murnau (a former art student) copies the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich (one of the leading painters in romanticism and a personal favorite) in still shots (Consider Friedrich's Moonrise at the Sea and Hutter's wife, Ellen, waiting for him by the sea, Friedrich's Woman at the Window and the symmetric shot of Ellen opening the window or Friedrich's The Abbey in the Oakwood and Nosferatu's destroyed castle at the end). Although Nosferatu is (in my opinion) the most terrifying portrayal of Dracula, it's also possibly the most daring, complex and human. The movie stresses nature (as evident in the large establishing shots) and above all doing as one's nature bids one. The movie shows arrays of living creatures (wolfs, horses, rats, flytraps, flies, spiders, cats and even bacteria, amplified by a microscope). They all do as their nature bids them, the wolf stalks horses, the spider devours its prey and the flytrap eats flies If we relate this to Nosferatu, what is he? The manifestation of evil or merely an outsider who doesn't fit in by nature? Given he's a vampire him sucking blood is only natural. He follows that urge that defines him - and he dies. He dies by the sunlight, he can't withstand. Is this a ""happy end""? Is it a tragedy? Is it neither? Personally I found the death to be very sad: The sun shines through and Nosferatu clutches to his heart and slowly dissolves into nothingness. It is debated whether or not Bram Stoker was gay. We're certain about Murnau. Given the disdain for homosexuals at the time, I think the ambivalence is very much intended.If you look beyond the shadows you might see something beautiful - Nosferatu is one of the most visionary examples of artistic realization I have ever witnessed and maybe the best horror movie of all time – 10/10",Nosferatu
255,swanmj,This is what True Vampire Mythology should be like,9,27 June 2015,"The vampire (Nosferatu) depicted in this movie is a truly scary, hideous, nightmarish spectacle to behold: hunched-over posture, pointy ears, crooked nose, sharp fangs, scrawny fingers, spindly limbs, and long fingernails. More vampires should be horrifying like Max Shreck's interpretation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. I am absolutely sick and tired of the trailers and advertisements for generic, pseudo-Gothic, angsty-teenager renditions of vampires - which depict vampires as attractive, romantic men or as cutesy schoolboys. I am glad, in contrast, that movies like this exist. If you are like me and want a vampire that is truly terrifying, please by all means choose ""Nosferatu"".Also, ""Nosferatu"" is a truly good film. I have watched it twice! It has a good plot, and it also has good music.",Nosferatu

257,dxia,Brilliant,8,14 March 2004,"I don't have a particular fondness for older silent films. Regardless of how influential they were, I always watch them with the same critical eye as any modern movie watcher, and if they don't age well, I tend to dislike them in spite of their ""classic"" mantel. 'Nosferatu' shows that good films do not die. The film is beautifully made and eerily haunting even though it's over eighty-years old. The producers were far ahead of their time, and audiences can see the early techniques that would eventually become the horror genre's mainstay. Max Schreck's resemblance to a vampire is still as disturbing today as it was over half a century ago, and a true movie afficionado has not lived until he or she has seen 'Nosferatu' played with a live orchestra.",Nosferatu
258,ww_sketcher,One of the Best Silent Horrors You'll see.,9,25 April 2005,"Nosferatu is one of the most celebrated Horror films ever, and with good reason. It's beautifully directed by F.W. Murnau (one of Germany's greatest Directors in any field), and as it's not terribly scary by any standards today, it still creates a sense of atmosphere which sticks with the film.The story of Nosferatu is fairly predictable considering, but it's still fun. From The Castle meeting with Count Orlock and Hutter to Nosferatu's slow take over the boat, and not to mention beautiful visuals filmed in outdoor German outback by Murnau. And don't forget the classic window and shadow scenes! Speaking of visuals, we have one of the best looking and disturbing icons of horror, or cinema in general with Nosferatu, with his long pointy fingers, to his warped face. He's become a popular culture icon for obvious reasons. Nosferatu is played well by his role, but Hutter is also well played (by silent movie standards of course).If there are problems with Nosferatu, it's that the plot is a big confusing to explaining why characters like Knock do what they do. And also some effects are a bit awkward, such as the speeding up of the camera for the horse chase, to the stop motion effects of Nosferatu's coffins and boat trip. Even in 1922, these shots could be done better.Regardless, the above is petty bickering. This isn't the best German Expressionist Horror film (The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari holds this title), but this one that sticks with you visually and in mood. When i first watched this film. I watched this for the first time at Midnight and in a Dark room alone. It was perfect. I suggest you all do the same.",Nosferatu

260,cutsman-2,THE Vampire Film,8,2 May 2010,"Vampires have come along way since the days of Nosferatu. Now they are our friends, they sparkle, and are the object of female desire. I can't imagine anyone in the film wanting to be with Max Schreck, or see him as some sort of object of sexual desire. Anyway, that is a bit of an aside, but it means that Schreck is quite effective. Actually more than effective he is terrifying. He lumbers around slowing, with his long arms hanging by his side, not speaking, praying on the living. The story follows a young man, Thomas Hutter, as he visits the castle of Nosferatu, after leaving bringing the vampire hot on his heels. The look of the film is really eerie. It was a foggy feel to it and a camera that lingers on the subjects as they are subjected to impended doom. The lighting is rather beautiful; Schreck's shadow is cast on walls with a certain foreboding. Nosferatu's arrival brings the black plague, which sweeps through the town, wiping it out. The filmmakers do a bang up job of making the town seem empty. There are later shots of coffins at dawn slowly crawling down the streets, the dead being carried away from the town. Hutter and his wife figure out, by reading the book of Vampires how to kill Nosferatu and succeed in doing so. This is how you make a horror film, there are no modern day jump scares, it is completely atmospheric. The viewer is placed into a town and left to watch the vampire as he wreaks havoc. There is no wink, nod to the audience. He moves slows and doesn't present much a threat but at the same time does, he is unpredictable and while he is terrifying looking, it is hard to draw your attention away from him. Horror films don't scare me and this didn't scare me either. But I can appreciate the atmosphere of the film and what the filmmakers were attempting to accomplish.",Nosferatu
261,manjavhern,Slow and Steady horror movie,10,10 May 2010,"I saw this film for my film history class and was greatly impressed with it. Being of the 21st century and seeing films that have so much violence, blood, and gore in them it's a little bit hard to be scared from ""classic"" horror films. But if you set your mind into the pasts time state of mind, you get an appreciation for the film. The film is very suspenseful and from reviews I read by film critiques, very symbolic. When I watched it I didn't get the feeling of the effects of World War II on the population; though after reading the reviews and seeing the film, I can see the connection between the two. After reading the papers, I then understood the actions and fears the protagonist felt from his experience with Nosferatu. I can only imagine the horror the movie brought to audiences in its time. Never having seeing anything so horrific or terrifying on the screen before must have been a tremendous eerie feeling. The movie did drag on a bit, but the scenes of importance were well done and very entertaining. I loved the scene where he slowly rises from his slumber. That scene is infamous and still inspires film today! To have that affect on the cinema is outstanding. I was very surprised with the ending. Even today it is uncommon to not get your happy ending, but for that time, I just didn't see it coming. It was very surprising when his love died in his arms. The music was very eerie and gave the film its horror feeling. I loved the scene with the carriage and the speed it went. It truly did give the feeling of being in a supernatural state. Over all a good horror movie for its time that would have a lasting effect the film industry for years to come.",Nosferatu
262,Keltxangel,Nosferatu,6,4 May 2010,"The vampire in the beginning of the film was really unsettling for me (I'm not a big fan of horror movies), and when he sucks the blood of Hutter when he cuts his thumb, it was a little shocking. I really liked the use of shadows in the film when the vampire is just about to come into the room in the middle of the night to suck the blood of his guest. The shadows were a warning of something bad about to happen and was also mysterious because you couldn't exactly, at first, see who was casting the shadow. I almost laughed when he climbs into his coffin to sleep at night, it just seemed like a stereotypical thing for a vampire to do, so it makes you go ""of course."" The end of the film is the climax, you are just waiting to see if he will really kill Hutter's wife and you are on the edge of your seat, rooting for something to go wrong so that this woman's life is saved. When the vampire does disappear in a puff of smoke, the image of his castle is now a castle that is destroyed, which is supposed to symbolize the end of the vampire.",Nosferatu
263,c-blauvelt,The original vampire film and most famous example of German Expressionism.,7,27 January 2006,"Nosferatu (1922) by F.W. Murnau--F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu may be the most famous example of German Expressionist film-making in the 1920s, and yet it is probably the least representative of the overall movement. The first tale of Dracula to hit the big screen, Nosferatu tells the tale of the vampire, Count Orlok, who brings terror to a village in Germany in the 1830s. The film is slowly paced in keeping with the Expressionist movement's emphasis on slow pacing to highlight nuance in the acting and detail in the mise-en-scene, but also in this case to orient the viewer to the background folklore of vampires, a mythology not in the forefront of the public consciousness in 1922. Compared to the highly distorted exaggerated sets of Expressionism's most representative film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu was mainly shot on location in order to emphasize the idea of the unnatural coming out of the natural, a very different notion from that of the carefully crafted, internal, emotionally subjective reality created in the mise-en-scene of most Expressionist films like Caligari. The acting of Max Schreck as Orlok is highly expressionistic, however, with his extremely distorted body movements. In fact, his acting was so unearthly for its time that many wondered if Max Schreck himself might not be a vampire as chronicled in the film Shadow of the Vampire (2000). The cinematography highlights a sense of claustrophobia through its alternating wide-shots and close-ups with scenes edited together using iris transitions. These edits complement the chamber-drama atmosphere of the tale, as do the many arches in the film, a dramatic motif to define a limited, claustrophobic space. Interestingly, whereas Caligari was a commentary on a hypnotic, but misguided power leading the passive masses to their doom in Germany in World War I, Nosferatu is a commentary on the death of the Great War. So profoundly is this film about death, that every character in some way orients himself or herself to it and establishes a relationship with death. Ideas of the supernatural and death pervade the editing together of disparate scenes, a variation of parallel editing in which two or more actions are perceived by the viewer to be taking place at the same time but there is some sort of supernatural connection between these simultaneous occurrences, such as when Hutter's wife perceives his danger at Orlok's castle when the vampire prepares to drink his blood. Ultimately, while the originator of the vampire film, and a classic of horror and silent cinema, the film's pacing is too slow for so minimal a story. As with many German expressionist films I fear that the emphasis on distorted mise-en-scene and acting betrays what is truly unique to the cinematic medium, editing. Paintings can have emotionally-subjective, distorted imagery as well as in the Expressionist paintings of Munch and Kandinsky, and many German plays in the teens displayed the overwrought performances of films like Nosferatu and Caligari, but this to me is a betrayal of what should be truly emphasized in cinema, editing. Editing is what truly differentiates the cinema from all other art forms, and is why I feel that German Expressionism with films like Nosferatu runs contrary to the soul of film-making.

264,emilhagberg-84632,Still awesome and creepy after 100 years!,10,28 May 2021,"It's been nearly 100 years since the release of one of the best movies of all time. Nosferatu has surely aged well, I must say! It's still a creepy and scary horror film and I can think of many films from the 1970s and 1980s that hasn't aged nearly as well as Nosferatu, which is a proof of timeless quality. I really enjoy the paranoid atmosphere and the light/shadow-contrast is genius!",Nosferatu
265,lauhmalfoy,"""Why did you kill such pretty flowers?!""",7,27 January 2011,"I really enjoyed this movie, specially because most of the scenes must have been really hard to make in 1922. However, I liked so much of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" that I was expecting a lot more from this (maybe I actually forgot this was made in German in 1922 and I shouldn't have). However, I did find Nosferatu creepy at times, specially Max Schreck character. He was just perfect for the role. None the less being a masterpiece, I really wished the story was more loyal to ""Dracula"": in the end everything ends up fine, in the movie Ellen dies. Also, I missed Van Helsing very much: I was always expecting for him to appear. Maybe I shouldn't think so much in the ""inspired by Dracula"" sentence: after all, it's an 1922 adaptation. For everybody who is wondering if this movie is worth watching: yes, it is. It's extraordinary how Murnau was able to film all this and still make it feel real.",Nosferatu
266,ricedanielle,what a horror,8,7 December 2008,"This film is both horrifying and comical. The make up used on the vampire is amazing. His ears look like they belong on an elf and his skin is extremely pale. His teeth look like they can be real even though they are all pointy and some rotted. The one make-up touch that is most interesting is his fingers. His fingers are abnormally long which makes his hunched over body even more awkward looking. One could think he wouldn't be able to pick anything up with them, yet he carries around his own coffin everywhere he goes. Thats the comical part of the movie (when he carries his coffin) the music that is played as he walks sometimes makes it almost impossible to stay serious.Some of the most interesting shots are those in which you see nothing but his shadows. When the monster is suppose to be walking up the stairs all you can see is the shadow of his long skeletal body and fingers. His look itself is just scary to think about. When he is on the ship walking and his body rises up. The first thing that comes to mind is "" keep that thing far away from me"" With his eyes bulging out of his head and his intense stair it seems as if the vampire is going to walk directly out of the screen. Moments like this occur all throughout the film. Its a good movie for someone to watch if they want to both be slightly frightened yet laugh a few times.",Nosferatu
267,saffell,Murnau Paves the Way for Horror,10,4 December 2003,"Spoilers herein:Murnau phenomenally portrays the myth of the vampire. He does so to such an extent that many people believed Max Schreck to be a real vampire in life off screen. The tale is well told and Schreck's acting is brilliant. Clearly, these are actors who understood the limitations of lighting and sound in the twenties.Schreck plays Nosferatu so well, that even I found it quote credible despite my skepticism about silent cinema ... my main interests lying in today's action-packed thrillers complete special effects, etc.  But Schreck's insistence on playing the part of the vampire on and off screen got me going and his dramatic gestures, his gazes, nearly all his movements scared me silly.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes scary movies. It is a must-see as it paved the way for all the horror films that ever came after it. Enjoy!",Nosferatu
268,MovieReporter,Murnau's masterpiece of menace and atmosphere,10,27 April 2005,"Whilst there are a few solid versions of Dracula out there, F.W. Marnau's 1922 silent adaptation remains the greatest film adaptation of Bram Stoker's tale. Ironically, the film was unauthorised and was eagerly sought to be destroyed by Stoker's widow which makes its latter-day rediscovery and restoration all the more appreciable. Opting for a folkloric depiction of the vampire, the film presents one of the screen's most menacing figures, the hideous Count Orlok (Max Schreck), far removed from the suave urbanity of the succeeding incarnations that we have grown used to. The story is the same: a naive young estate agent ventures to Transylvania in order to secure the bloodthirsty aristocrat's move to his home town where strange happenings are occurring. Yet, what makes Nosferatu the definitive Dracula movie is its grandiose air of menace, atmosphere and fascination which few films ever have rivalled. For its time, the film is stunningly cinematic with its use of location and parallel crosscutting whilst Marnau assembles a gallery of unforgettable and chilling shots, not least the sight of a shadowed Orlok creeping swiftly upstairs ready to devour his victim. Eighty years down the line, Marnau's work firmly stands as a superior piece of silent cinema as well as one of the definitive horror classics.",Nosferatu

It's a great classic, but I'm not too fond of the updated music they changed to this film. I much prefer the original film with the original music. The original was eerie and spooky on its own. There was no need to change the music. Once more, modern people have to ruin classic original films.They did it with Jaws, Critters, Jurassic Park, The Terminator, a bunch of other films (do I even need to mention the original Star Wars trilogy?) and now, Nosferatu. Why can't they leave classic films alone? If it ain't broke, don't ""fix"" it.",Nosferatu
270,djayesse,After the bridge...,10,10 March 2017,"Unforgettable The magnificent Murnau. In my opinion, his most impressive film. There is a threat flying upon us all through the movie. And the special effects increase this threat: the coffin closes itself and moves without any help, door which opens or closes without any human intervention... And of course, all these shadows and lights which are Murnau's touch, and a constant touch in the German cinema at this time. This is Dracula. And even better than Dracula: Orlock (Max Schreck). Terrifying Orlock, frightening Orlock, captivating Orlock. A shadow became flesh and blood. With two incisors (in the later Dracula movies, his canine teeth will replace them) which help him suck his victims' blood. Nosferatu, it is above all a strange mood, a worrying atmosphere: thanks to its characters and settings.The first important location is Wisborg, a port city, where a plague has spread since the arrival of a phantom ship. In this boat, a few coffins containing Orlock's body and his native soil, and also a few contaminated rats. The second important place is Orlock's castle, with its crypt where he can rest during the day. This is where everything starts. This is where Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is kept prisoner after his blood had been sucked. He will escape this castle, but it will be a rough time for him. In Wisborg, Orlock lives in a huge windy house without any windows. But he does not care. He needed a house in front of Hutter's which could allow him to spy on his wife, the one with such a beautiful neck... The last important - and probably most impressive - location is Hutter's house: its stairs, its bare wall, and the room where the fatal vampire attack takes place.Hutter - Harker in Bram Stoker's novel - sells a house to a strange man: count Orlock. He is the vampire's first victim (in the film). He has a wife, Ellen (Greta Schröder) - Mina -, a beautiful woman with black hair. His boss, Knock (Alexander Granach) - Renfield - has sealed a deal with Orlock, which made him his servant. Ellen, the vampire's new victim, risks the eternal damnation, but is eventually saved. But to what cost? And Orlock. The central character. He drives the cart which brings Hutter to his castle. We can only see his great and staring eyes. Hutter is worried also by his appearance: tall, bald, with pointed ears, thick eyebrows and very long nails, also dressed in black. He does not make big gestures: only his natural pose scares us. He is the personification of terror: - when he appears on the deck of the boat, film in a low angle, giving the impression of someone (something?) bigger, and even more frightening ; - when he walks up the stairs towards Ellen's room, his black shadow on the bare wall increases once more the terror. Therefore, when he is hit by the sun rays, everyone feels relieved.I could talk to you about the premonition of such a movie: the brown plague which spread over Germany a few years later. But I will not. Let us appreciate this movie and consider it as it is: simply a masterpiece. No other vampire movie reached such a splendor. Except maybe Vampyr, by Carl Theodor Dreyer. But this is another story.",Nosferatu
271,mcfloodhorse,clammy and creepy,9,21 March 2006,"Although at a rather quick 90 minutes, experiencing 'Nosferatu' seems as surreal in its semi-illogical disjointedness as an early Bunuel film and not unlike a dark and dreary drinking binge; one recalls only certain sequences of the narrative, punctuated by large gaps in time and in the association of events/characters. This doesn't necessarily detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, but rather adds to its eternal strangeness.Hans Erdmann's (?) original score is at once darkly foreboding and highly hypnotic -- like Count Orlok himself -- with its haunting phrases unfolding and folding back on themselves like a spiral. Orlok similarly comes out of the darkness to glide through walls or up stairs and then, receding from light and recoiling his claws, he inexplicably vanishes from sight (and from script) for minutes on end....only to re-emerge from within his coffin in one of the film's most infamous images.Orlock's insatiable lust for young blood gives the film an erotic charge otherwise repressed in the waking lives of the ""human"" characters of Jonathon and Nina (surfacing only slightly in Nina's somnambulism).The two most amusing moments in the film also depend on the ""non-human"" characters of sickly Renfield and his master, the Count. Renfield escapes from his prison cell pursued by a large mob of locals and, fleeing to a rooftop, starts throwing stones at the angry Volk while wearing the mischievous grin of a child. The Count, meanwhile, adds an element of surrealism as he does a skinny-legged shuffle through town with his own coffin in tow. Still quite creepy and darkly comical after all these years.",Nosferatu

It is really a good movie but an actual spectator will surely found it too innocent, perhaps a little childish... Nosferatu won`t scare us today, we`ll prefer Lugosi`s Dracula, which is much more real, than this angel of the night. In german expressionism, Kaligari is undoubtedly much better, and with Metropolis (by Fritz Lang) the masterpiece of this cinema.",Nosferatu

However we only got to see clips from Nosferatu, so the teacher could show us the characteristics of this era. Then a couple of months later, I found myself staying up late, and by pure coincidence, I happened to catch the movie from the very beginning. It might have been 3am, but I was wide awake throughout the whole movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. This masterpiece will live on forever, and I recommend this film to everyone who wants to know how it was done back then.

276,butler-britney,"Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens",9,4 May 2010,"Over all the silent films of the world and especially German Expressionist cinema, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror F.W. Murnau, Germany 1922, 94 min.) sticks out the most to me. Murnau continually proves to be a genius director that has influenced both German Cinema and Cinema on a global level. Nosferatu is a story based off the classic novel Count Dracula. Fun fact of the day, the film was actually sued for copy right because of its illegal adaption of Count Dracula.Young Hutter travels east to Count Orlok's castle in Transylvania for business. The Count turns out to be a vampire and travels west to obtained Hutter's wife, Ellen. The town is soon plagued with death and the only way to defeat the Count depends on Ellen's self-sacrifice.The genius of the film starts in the script and creative direction. Nosferatu becomes more then a horror film like Dracula, but is a leading example in German Expressionism as it parallels characters and situations to experiences in World War 1. One scene that truly embodied this analogy was the scene of caskets being carried down the town street. This image was a common one as women watched the caskets of their men who were sacrifice in war.Murnau introduces stunning editing techniques including the use of speeding up the pace and using negatives to provide symbolic imagery. The ability to defy space and time through editing is one rarely, if not ever, seen before. I highly suggest this classic film to anyone no matter their taste in genres.",Nosferatu
277,FlickeringLight,Cinematic Gem Of German Propaganda Films,10,2 July 2004,"Saturday79 hit it right on the head-- this is a film that at its heart is a condemnation of the Bolsheviks and their Communist ideals, which had come to power in Russia five years earlier. This eastern menace is portrayed as the new Black Plague, spreading across Europe and leaving destruction in its wake. The Plague metaphor is carried far, complete with rats and wagons carrying the dark dead bodies of the afflicted. I don't think it is a mistake that Orlok looks like Lenin with rat ears and teeth. It is also amusing that the vampire, usually a metaphor for seduction, is repulsive. Again, I don't think this is an accident. Imagine the horror of a German who falls under the spell of the Bolshevik monster, only to see its true form when it's too late.The Weimar Republic had good reason to fear the Bolsheviks considering the economic state of Germany at the time, and it is fascinating how Murnau is able to reconcile a story that he loves (Dracula) with government propaganda to make an incredible and lasting art film that was resonant beyond its time.Another interesting aspect of this film is Murnau's blending of impressionism and expressionism. At times his film is overtly expressionist, with ominous skies and oddly shaped sets, while at other times he takes an impressionist tact, mostly during scenes of the peace in Bremen before the arrival of Orlok. This in itself is another political comparison between the Weimar Republic and the Bolsheviks.With its political insight within its own time that would prove resonant if not downright prophetic in the coming decades, combined with its cinematic ingenuity that began to blaze trails for future films, Nosferatu is clearly a great film that deserves its place in the history of cinema.",Nosferatu
278,stephenhill8,Disappointing,3,3 December 2002,"I had the perfect setting for seeing this film classic- in a historic theatre with working original organ played as the silent film background.  Sadly, it was simply consistently disappointing.  Though historically interesting (e.g. seeing special effects ingenuity with 1920s technology), nothing could save this overall sleeper of a silent film.  I believe that what we have in the high rating here (and for many old films), is that only those who adore all old films have seen and rated them-- highly.",Nosferatu
279,saturday79,Setting the film in its political context,10,8 April 2004,"People have already said everything there is to say about the film itself, mainly that it is a fantastic film, a wonderful achievement for 1922 with the special effects of the carriage etc., superb use of light-shadow contrast and a testimony to expressionist acting, although not the expressionist set which we see in films such as Caligari (Wiene, 1919).However, what many people ignore is the potency of the political message of the film. 1922 was at the height of hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic which ruled over Germany from 1919 to 1933. The public were used to frequent, violent political confrontation between factions on the extreme left and extreme right.What we see in Nosferatu is a theme typical of early Weimar cinema: the omnipresent, omnipotent tyrant in the form of Nosferatu (also Caligari, Dr. Mabuse etc.). The tyrant comes from the east (it is unsure what this represents, though I would argue that, given the political situation and the recent communist uprising in Russia, it is the Bolshevists) and we see by comparing the first shot of a quiet, tranquil 'traditional German' town and the last shot of a dilapidated, ruined castle, the progress from the bourgeois ideal into anarchy, chaos and destruction during the film.The film shows that no-one was able to stop Nosferatu in his tracks before he arrived to ruin Wisborg, the town where the film is set. Only Ellen, by sacrificing herself and giving her life, can stop the tyrant. So soon after WWI, it is clear that such a sacrifice is not portrayed as desirable. The film removes Van Helsing, the policeman in the Dracula novel, from the plot, meaning that there is no strong force in 'traditional' Germany- the power is held by Hutter, a middle-class estate agent. The middle classes in power at the time in Germany were the liberals of the Weimar Republic. Hutter is portrayed as weak, easily overcome and without much of a clue as to what's going on. This is clearly a call for a strong leader to fill the evident void in Germany, to come in and rescue society from the threat of being taken over by Bolshevism.When we look at Murnau's later films, such as Dr. Mabuse, Der Spieler, it becomes clear that the right-wing (not Nazi) anti-authoritarian message of the film was not a one-off on his part.",Nosferatu
280,pavo6503,"I would hardly call this film ""chilling""",5,12 October 2005,"Neither good for it's many credits nor bad for its faults, Nosferatu is worth more for its film trivia value. I'll save us all the plot summary, plenty of those already.I have a newer DVD version, without the colorization or silly soundtrack. I personally prefer to watch this movie with a CD playing simultaneously, like the Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz trick. I have found the Clockwork Orange soundtrack (minus the Lighthouse Keeper song), Isao Tomita's Snowflakes Are Dancing and Everything You've Always Wanted to Hear On the Moog... albums work particularly well. Their use of synthesized classical music make up for the camp and thespian-ism of the film.Let's get real, this movie is NOT scary, creepy, hair raising, terrifying or worth any of the other accolades I have read on this site. Max Schrek's makeup is good, but he is TOO stiff an actor. Harker is a goof-ball. Nina looks like a 7 foot goon in most of her scenes. The captions are laughable, Renfield serves no purpose in this version of the film and so on...I have found the more recent Nosferatu (from the '70s) to be a better vampire film. If anything annoys me the most about these Gothic horror classics is their EXTREME camp. Tone it down, it will give us less to laugh about.I DO enjoy old films, but I watch them for their historic value, and to put my toddler to sleep when it's bedtime.

282,creatorvani,A Classic,8,9 March 2021,"'Nosferatu (Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie des Grauens)' was directed by F.W. Murnau during the times of German Expressionism in 1922.The interesting thing in Murnau's Nosferatu that it not entirely follows the regular German expressionism. The clothes, set designs, the environment stays true to reality as much as it can with a wide open world - so very opposite of Caligari -, however the plot is that what contains the elements of the German expressionism and that's why it stands out other than its creative execution and developed story.Murnau worked with Max Reinhardt in hiss theater after he finished University and that's where he learned how to play with light and shadows, how to make an atmosphere that is the true backbone of horror. There are beautifully shot scenes, personally favorite of mine the iconic blue-green light with the vampire's shadow as he goes up the stairs, the shadow of his claws showing on the wall. The other one is when he feeds on Ellen, and everything is dark except him. Brilliant composition and cinematography.It is an Art Film, the parent of all Dracula and Vampire movies, but originally adapted from Bram Stoker's book. Because of Plagiarism they had to avoid sticking with the original names of the characters, that's why everyone is called in a different name. Some scenes was changed, executed differently or cut out, and character have been changed a little as well, that's why we don't have a vampire expert called Van Helsing for example. After a while though, everything was lost that was connected to this film because of the Plagiarism with the adaptation - but as we can see, some of it was saved and that's why we can witness it today.One day Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) has to travel to Transylvania to visit and make a deal with Count Orlok (Max Schreck) who plans to buy a house where Hutter lives. Hutter, therefore, goes there and has no idea what a terrifying monster he is about to meet.The acting is brilliant from everyone. Hutter is a very enjoyable character who you're rooting for to arrive on time to save the day and the actor's charisma is the one make this possible. Count Orlok - aka Dracula's actor is terrifying. Absolute goosebumps everywhere, a true monster. There's nothing human about him, the way he stands and walks, the body languages he conveys and the expressions he does is such a stunning job. He is Dracula in his act. Ellen (Greta Schröder) is an incredible actress, you can feel her terror when the monster feeds on her, and all the little romantic scenes with her and Hutter is a joy to witness.The ending of the film made history - every Vampire film made their creatures witness the sun. It is insane to think about how much it influenced Cinema, just as well as Caligari.Personally, I liked it but I had moments (especially with all the boat scenes) when I wanted to skip and that's why it has 4 stars. I loved the beginning of this film, it really was mysterious and so engaging. The lights and the environment they filmed in was also so pleasing to the eye. Overly a classic, a very good film and everyone should watch it.",Nosferatu
283,jt-hix2112,Great creepy atmosphere – Left me wanting more though,7,3 February 2010,"As most people know, this is Murnau's version of Dracula. To try and dodge copyright laws, he changed all of the character's names from Bram Stoker's book and fiddled with the story. The end result is a very creepy, atmospheric film – the performance of Max Schrek gives us the most disturbing portrayal of the Dracula character, one that is quite different from the suave and charming Dracula of Bela Lugosi. I've seen this movie twice now, and both times I was a little let down. Like I said, the atmosphere is great, but the story itself just left me feeling like there should have been more to it. The beginning really got me interested, but slowed down for me when Orlock leaves Transylvania. Don't get me wrong, there are some great scenes after that, such as when Orlock reveals himself on the boat or when Hutter gets a ride in a very creepy carriage, but the story or maybe the pacing just doesn't quite do if for me. The ending especially is a big let down, I was expecting something much more.Like I said, I have seen this movie twice. The first time I saw it, it was a horrible transfer with no tinting and an awful score that did not match the creepiness of the film at all. For my second viewing, I saw the Kino version, a great improvement. The transfer was beautiful, all the scenes were tinted, and the soundtrack was said to be the original score. I believe that my first viewing of Nosferatu has ruined it for me. Do not watch the version that gives the characters their original book names, it's horrible. Make sure you get the Kino version, you'll have a much better experience. Go into this with no expectations and it will probably turn out better for you than it did for me.I give this 7/10, the eeriness of it made up a lot for my disappointment in the story.

It was my induction into the world of silent cinema, something that I have now grown very fond of. It was also one of the first vampire films I had seen. I have now seen several of each genre, and Nosferatu remains a standout. It truly uses the lack of sound to it's advantage, creating a chilling atmosphere and real sense of foreboding. The camerawork is excellent, showing some early innovation, and genuinely helps with the narrative which, at times, can be a little slow and plodding. Although it is not the greatest silent film I have seen, it is still the best vampire film. Had I seen a lesser silent film first, I fear I may never had kept my interest in them. 8/10.",Nosferatu
286,johnwolpert,Remarkable,7,21 February 2002,"In the opening scenes, ""Nosferatu"" establishes itself through a series of ominous images: an obscured sunset, a silenced crowd at a Carpathian inn, and two of the most dreadfully frightening characters I've ever witnessed in a film. Max Schreck and Alexander Granach play Count Orlock and Mackler Knock respectively, and both deliver performances that, even though they are silent, evoke as much fear and mystery as Hannibal Lecter.
What is so impressive about this film is that it is able to inspire fear without modern horror film conventions. No objects suddenly revealing themselves alongside a bold musical note, no horror villain stereotypes. This movie inspires fear through the manipulation of its characters; their movements, their costume and in the case of Count Orlock, their slow, foreboding walk. The most frightening point in this film is when the wide eyes of Max Schreck are first seen. This is not the kind of horror that warrants a scream, but rather leaves you completely silent and in awe of its geniusI gave this movie a 9 almost exclusively because of its innovation and artistry. The plot, which bares little resemblance to the Stoker novel in that it doesn't include many of the sub-stories, is not as enthralling as recent versions. Then again it doesn't need it, the purpose is clear and apparent; Nosferatu is not suave or manipulating, it is a torn, haunted soul and this movie gives the only sincere depiction of Dracula that I have seen. Truly remarkable.",Nosferatu
287,FightinTexasAggies,Nosferatu Linked To WWI,8,11 May 2010,"Nosferatu, I thought, was a great film. After watching and analyzing it, it is easy to see the direct relatedness to WWI. The eeriness, the sense of not knowing, and suspense are all common factors in which people feel undergoing war. Nosferatu demonstrates how closely related film of that era was to politics brought about by the war. They effectively show how WWI is directly linked to the German expressionist movement. This movement then later sparked rise of the postwar horror genre. World War I not only paved the way for many filmmakers to come, but it changed German silent cinema forever. During F. W. Murnau's film, the main character, Hutter, leaves his plague-infested town to meet Graf Orlak, who later is deemed to be a vampire. After waking up, Hutter realizes who Graf Orlak really is. Hutter then must race against time to get back home in order to save his wife from Orlak. The setting of the plagued town is easily comparable to the setting of WWI—just set in a different time period. In both, innocent people died, and there was nothing the average person could do to stop neither sickness nor death. Orlak symbolizes the war itself, while the main character embodies Germany. Germany sought out the war, but in the end the war retaliated and came after Germany. In the end of the movie, Orlak dies once subjected to the sunlight. The sun rising symbolizes a new coming, specifically for Germany. Orlak is killed by this new coming which can be interpreted as a foreshadow that Germany would try once again to win another war, WWII. This film was great, it was ahead of its time and forever impacted German Cinema.",Nosferatu
288,actionstudiosco,"Once underrated, now very much overrated",5,4 September 2014,"It seems to be ""mainstream"" to say that any film from before the 30's is a great film, when in fact, that's not true at all. There were - believe it or not - some terrible films. Dare I say it, Nosferatu is one of them.The movie lacks a protagonist, is terribly paced, and we are never really properly introduced to any characters. We think ""Ok, this guy doesn't believe in vampires,"" and ""Ok, this guy is scary,"" but none of them ever feel like real people, because none of them act like real people.If it wasn't for the groundbreaking effects and bone-chilling cinematography, make-up, and acting on Max Schreck's part, there really wouldn't be anything to like about this film. Nonetheless, it certainly is creepy, so for a horror flick, I suppose it succeeds. As a decent film, it does not.",Nosferatu

I keep seeing this movie listed or described as purely a drama! Apparently people assume any 'sillyness' in the scenes to have been unintentional? The hallmarks of a naive and primitive age? You really think the scriptwriters wrote lines like 'whoops it seems I got bitten by two musquitos in my neck, right next to eachother while I slept deeply in this terrible castle in the land of thieves and phantoms but don't worry by love kiss kiss' without realizing that it can't be taken seriously?Well here's a newsflash: this movie was always intended as a comedy.

This showing was supported by a live organ play (directly composed for the movie), which suited perfectly. Nosferatu is a good, maybe even a great film, but only if you see it as classic. It is the first vampire movie, it is the first big Murnau feature and it set the tone for hundreds of followers. I can appreciate how innovative Murnau uses light and  shadows in this typical expressionistic manner and why this must have been a scary film in the 20ies, but it does not scare me today.

293,hughesreviews-co-uk,"Re-released for Halloween this year, F.W Murnau's 'Nosferatu' is a beautiful and chilling piece of silent cinema that set the foundation of the Gothic cinematic tradition.",9,27 October 2013,"Released in 1922, 'Nosferatu' was, essentially, an unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula novel. Disguising the film under original names and details, this Dracula story portrays Count Orlok negotiating a move to Bremen with realtor Thomas Hutter; and like the plagued-diseased rats of history, the Nosferatu is, naturally, a harbinger of death; bringing a great darkness with him in as he obsessively pursues the neck of Hutter's wife.Masterfully directed, timeless images of the nocturnal blood sucker gravitating through the shadows - as one with the dark – will send chills down your spine; uninvintingly locking themselves away in the darker side of your memory. Max Schreck's Count Orlok grotesques all with his rat-like physical demeanor and extending claws; the epitome being the iconic shot of the shadow ascending the stairs. You feel a sense of unexplainable elegance to the shot; not just because of it's iconic status and cultural significance. It is pure Gothic horror; unnerving through it's sheer visual majesty. This is a vampire you won't be accustomed to seeing if you have been a regular viewer of the the shirtless escapades present in the 'Twilight' films. Nosferatu is not exactly heart-warming, buff or sexy. More, a pale stick insect which has just crawled out of a rat hole. Edward Cullen and family like transparent architecture, with their expensive, modern real estate. Nosferatu prefers his abode to be a beautifully haunting, Bavarian castle.Their is a great charm in seeing one camera techniques pioneered. Film was still a relatively new art-form and 'Nosferatu' pushed that art forward through it's usage and merging of light, subject and camera to create truly oppressive atmosphere. Not even Francis Ford Coppola, or the great Werner Herzog, could create the same sense of mysticism. Could it suggest the invention of sound recording has been a detraction of quality? No, but I certainly can't see how dialogue would have improved the film. It just shows how great Murnau's grasp of the visuals are; his impressionist images effecting audiences for nearly 100 years. Coppola's and Herzog's interpretations of the Dracula myth are both great films in their own right, and there are many more Dracula stories I can watch with certain satisfaction, but non can do what this original vampire movie did: scare me. All the fabulous cinematic innovations that occupy our screens today do nothing in comparison to one inspired performance in 1922 from Max Shreck, playing the physical embodiment of all things foul. For this reason, he takes his rightful place as one of the greatest movie monsters to grace celluloid.Stoker's heirs sued over 'Nosferatu' and the devastating ruling ordered all copies to be destroyed. But, like the movies iconic monster, it seems the film is immortal. One print survived. Because of that one print, we all have the privilege of indulging ourselves in this classical Gothic pleasure. Which many of us, to our disgrace, have not done. Unless you are a film student, forced to digest and evaluate the importance of a silent movie classic, I doubt you have been casually watching 'Nosferatu' when Halloween comes around. Time has left it behind, but thanks to the Masters of Cinema re-release and the film's triumphant return to cinema's this Halloween with the BFI's Gothic season, it can take it's place on everyone's collection shelf as, not only a historically significant piece of filmmaking, but a great, casual viewing experience that everyone can appreciate.Go to hughesreviews.co.uk to see the original article and more reviews!",Nosferatu

Different names and settings have been used to delete the threat of being sued. Such as Count Dracula ha been changed to Count Orlock. Otherwise the first vampire movie is just like your story, Bram Stoker!Although many sources online will let you download this movie entirely, it is definately much better if you watch this movie on VHS or DVD, in the dark.

didn't find this movie scary and didn't like the plot. It was a knock off Dracula, nothing more. Both the acting and characters were average. At times, I thought it was cheesy
and over dramatic. It just wasn't for me. I know the movie is beloved by some, but I did not see the appeal. I will say, however, I liked the setting. Nosferatu's castle was a nice set
as well as the town Knock had lived in. The score was beautiful, but by the end of the movie it had gotten a little redundant. Overall, I thought it was just OK. Maybe for the time period, it was truly horrific and enjoyed by many. I don't
think it has aged well and I don't feel it is a must watch. I will say, however, it historically speaking it was a fun watch. It shouldn't even exist!",Nosferatu
299,ais_film_reviews,Short review,9,13 October 2006,"Nosferatu is a timeless production. For some it is shocking, frightening and bloodcurdling for others boring and faint. It's rightly said that it requires specific and understanding approach, especially for the modern audience. Whoever has become convinced to watch it has to be aware that back in 1920's film makers' technological abilities where pretty limited. Expecting Nosferatu to come up to modern criteria is simply sacrilege. The requirements of the modern audience are much different than these 80 years ago. It is noticeable that recently people are more scared of seeing blood and guts all over the place rather than a psychological image of the night's child slowly creeping to get his victim. The editing very nicely works to increase the effectiveness of Nosferatu's image. In general the acting is quite typical for the silent movie era. Because there is no dialog, actors exaggerate their gesticulation and commonly use obvious face expressions that could show their emotions to the viewer. At this point I would like to mention the character of Thomas Hutter. From the very beginning of the movie it's clearly shown how narcissistic and overconfident he is. However as the action goes by we can see how his character undergoes the changes caused by demonic Count Orlok. Max Schreck's acting is different. It's very specific what makes it an outstanding performance. He doesn't gesticulate; he moves slowly, his posture is hunched and his face expression practically does not change throughout the movie what makes it look like a mask. All these factors make up one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. Story telling is surprisingly good especially for a silent movie. However if anyone wants to have a full comprehension about it needs to re-watch the movie. As I mentioned before the editing has been done pretty nicely. All the shots of Nosferatu are very effective. The perfect usage of lighting and shadows as well as his make-up gives the tension, terror and a little bit of the shivers. He was so good that after the movie's release there was a rumor about him being a real vampire. This fact was by the way the main reason I wanted to see this movie although I didn't expect myself to have such a reflection. That is why I am not disappointed. It's important to understand the difference between people's perception now and 80 years ago. I doubt If anyone who was making Nosferatu back in 1920's would have thought how it will be seen in 21st century.",Nosferatu
300,FilmDog-1,A Symphony of Horrors,10,14 March 2002,"They don't make films like this faded, haunting masterpiece of silent cinema anymore.When Dracula was first put on sale for movie rights; the one of the first men to grab it was F.W.Murnau one of the most of the famous German directors of his time. By the time word got back to them about using the rights of the name and storyline of Dracula (Owned by the rights of Florence's widow.) Murnau had alread started production on the film; so to get around it they cut out the name 'Dracula' and replaced it with Count Orlok, Jonathan Harker became Hutter and Ban Helsing became Professor Bulwer; Orlock stalks the gothic streets of Bremen instead of Vistorian London.What is so different from Nosferatu and many of the others films of the time was that most of the film was shot on actually locations around Eastern Europe; the production hardly used any studio sets. What makes the most haunting feature tho is the sense of realism and the expressionism (most evident in the interiors od Orlok's Castle) that gives the film its hypnotic visual power.If there is any film a film student would need to have in his/her collection, it's this film. Although it is a hard task to find any surving copies. The reason for this is when the film was released Florence Stoker (widow of the author of Dracula) noticed the comparsion; she pursued the case relentlessly and in July 1925 a German court ordered all prints of the film to be destroyed. Luckily for us several prints of the film survived; a few in which have still been lost over the last few 8 decades.But thanks to the 2000 release of 'Shadow of a Vampire' a film  which looks behind the filming of Nosferatu and starring John Malkovich (F.W.Murnau) and Willem Dafoe (Count Orlok) the film was released for the first time on DVD in it's full original length of 94 minutes.Sadly soon after the film hit America in 1929; at the age of 43; Murnau was killed in a car crash.""Men must die. Nosferatu does not die!"" proclaimed the original publcity for the film. We can only hope it's the truth for this film.",Nosferatu

I just wonder what these guys would have done with todays technology cause in a nut shell this film raises more hairs than most of your more modern vampire flicks out together.

305,sldmseen,The Most Entertaining German Impressionist Film for our Day,9,10 April 2000,"While ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" remains the hallmark of the genre, ""Nosferatu"", by F.W. Murnau holds sway as the most immediately accessible and entertaining of these films from the early half of the century that so influenced filmmaking, and a wonderful example of the genre in its own right.In the film, a young impressionable working-class man named Hutter, played in an almost infantilely ignorant manner, goes on an assignment to sell a piece of abandoned property across from his home to one Count Orlock in Transylvania.  Of course this dark figure turns out to be a vampire, who easily overtakes the young man and heads back to his home in Weisborg to take possession of his new property, bring death and destruction with him.An obvious thievery of the Dracula story by Bram Stoker, Mrs. Stoker sued to have all copies of this film destroyed.  Luckily, it survived and it is now agreed to be one of the major origins of modern horror films.  But in a deeper analysis (which the German Impressionists were trying to convey in their art) one sees the sexual triangle between the young man (Hutter), his wife, and the Nosferatu, driven by the struggle between civilized and bestial impulses.  One can also view all of the characters and their stories as a microcosm for a single human mind, a characteristic seen often in this genre.Beyond the psychology and art though, this is an old silent horror film that can still give me the jitters if I sit and watch it alone at night.--GD",Nosferatu

308,washsem2001,Not that great,5,17 March 2002,"While Max Schreck's performance is unquestionably remarkable (and highly unique among all the romanticized Bela Lugosi impersonations found in most other vampire movies), ""Nosferatu"" as a whole didn't impress me. My disappointment may just have been a result of the particular version I saw--namely, the 60-minute Americanized version in which all the names had been changed back to match the original Dracula story (Dracula, Harker, Renfield, etc.). Even so, however, it definitely didn't meet my expectations.Of course, as with any ""classic"" movie, there are many good things to say about it. Schreck is phenomenal. His performance alone makes the movie worthwhile. Technically the film was far ahead of its time, making new innovations in camera work and special effects. (The makeup on Schreck is believable even to this day.) And the film as a whole certainly has its moments. The best scene in the whole movie, I think, comes when the ship floats peacefully into the perfectly calm, quiet harbor of Bremen...the eerie calm of the scene masks the terrible cargo the ship carries on board. (And you don't even see the vampire!)Nevertheless, the flaws of this movie definitely outweigh the positives. There is a distracting subplot involving Renfield which comes out of nowhere and doesn't connect at all to the rest of the movie. Aside from Schreck and the actor playing Renfield, the acting is so-so at best (the actor playing Harker is particularly hammy). I can't forget the awful, awful score, which featured among its many glorious moments a highly out-of-place jazz interlude and (most hilariously) ""Renfield's Theme,"" a bouncy circus melody which played every time Renfield was on screen (and reminded me way too much of ""Torgo's Theme"" in Manos: Hands of Fate--which is not a compliment). The score, of course, may have just been added to the Americanized version I saw. But the topper was the fact that, although Count Orlock/Dracula is supposed to die if exposed to sunlight, he spends half of his onscreen time wandering around outside in the middle of the afternoon (as evidenced by the obvious shadows all over the place).See ""Shadow of the Vampire"" instead. Willem Dafoe is just as good as Orlock as Max Schreck was, and his character is much more defined and nuanced and interesting. (The climax is also much more thrilling and--well, climactic.) I give this movie a 5/10, almost entirely on the strength of Schreck as an actor (as you can tell, I can't say enough about it). Otherwise, ""Nosferatu"" doesn't satisfy.",Nosferatu

Beyond the definitions, any viewer can not help but consider it a series of pictures at an exhibition, harbingers of horrific suggestions beyond the capabilities of Friederich and Munch. Max Schreck will probably be remembered as the Nosferatu closer to the figure of the vampire that has ever appeared on the screens, so as to suggest (to some) that Murnau had a real vampire playing the role. It seems then that Schreck was his real last name, curious twist of fate, since it means ""Terror"" in German! Although the names of the characters from the novel ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker were all changed, the director was sued by Stoker's heirs and lost the lawsuit. Returning to the movie, even if seen in a cut version (missing half an hour) it is a timeless masterpiece, and I think that instead of staying here to hear me talk about it you should go and see it!",Nosferatu

312,starostenkoivan-90744,German Expressionism masterpiece,10,11 November 2019,"In the 1920s the origins of the horror genre were born in Germany. The turning point was ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", in which groundbreaking sets depicting the mind of a madman were used. ""Caligari"" was the beginning of the new trend in the film industry known as German Expressionism.The main features of this trend were unusual sets with distorted proportions, the theme of madness with a touch of dark romanticism, the events of the plot unfolding in an imaginary world, the use of play of shadows, and deliberately exaggerated acting.The particular influence of German Expressionism may be observed in Tim Burton's motion pictures.""Nosferatu"" is one of the most prominent representatives of the German Expressionism.The film is an unofficial adaptation of the most famous vampire novel - Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"". Its director F. W. Murnau was one of the greatest figures of the German Expressionism era.Murnau changed the names of the main characters, as Bram Stoker's widow refused to sell the film rights. Count Dracula became Count Orlok, Jonathan Harker - Thomas Hutter, Mina - Ellen, etc. The setting was transferred from London to a fictional German city - Wisborg (linked together names of two cities - Wismar and Lübeck) in 1838.Thus, the plot of the film is very different from the book, and it should be considered as a separate product. In Murnau's film the Count does not look attractive and seductive as he was in the book, but pretty much the opposite. Murnau was guided by the Eastern European vampire mythology, in which the vampire appearance was the following: bald head, pointed ears, long claws and rat-like incisors. The name of this vampire is Nosferatu, which is translated from Greek as ""disease-bearing"". This myth is originated in times of plague, which was carried by rats. According to this myth, Nosferatu was the leader of the rats carrying the plague and death. That's why he had a rat-like appearance.In Murnau's film it was quite so - Count Orlok arrived to Germany with a huge amount of rats, spreading plague upon all the inhabitants of Wisborg.Another difference from the original novel was that after the Count bit his victims they did not turn into vampires - they died from his bite. That's the way Ellen dies: she sacrifices herself to the vampire for the sake of the rest.Nosferatu dies from the rays of the rising sun. This concept has appeared exactly in this film, because in the book Dracula moved easily in London in the afternoon. He simply was not that strong during the day light hours. The myth that a vampire can die from the sunlight appeared precisely due to Murnau.One of the artistic achievements of the film was the scene filmed in the negative, in which Orlok carries Hutter to the castle, also the fast playback of the film strip, which had not been used in cinema before. Gothic sets masterfully create the sense of suspense and estrangement. The exterior shots made in Slovakia are incredibly fascinating.Being enlightened in mysticism and the occult, Murnau ingeniously used his knowledge to create the sense of fear and terror in his masterpiece.The incredible film sets were created by the production designer Albin Grau. Grau, as well as Murnau, was completely absorbed into the occult and the supernatural. And initially it was his idea to make a vampire film (being in the German Army during the First World War, he heard from a Serbian farmer that his father was a vampire).Due to Grau ""Nosferatu"" acquired the dark sinister tone, and the stunning Gothic atmosphere. Count Orlok's appearance was also designed by Albin Grau. Grau was responsible for drawing the posters for the advertising film campaign as well.The role of Count Orlok was brilliantly played by Max Schreck (whose surname is translated as ""terror""). He created the canonical image of a vampire which terrifies even nowadays. This role made him famous for all his lifetime, and made him the most recognizable movie vampire of all time.The role of Ellen was worthy played by Greta Schroeder - theater and movie actress, and, besides, Paul Wegener's wife - one of the dicoverers of the German Expressionism . She brought a considerable depth into the role of Ellen, who was ready to sacrifice her life for the sake of her beloved and other people.Thanks to this film I became a fan of the horror classics and eventually wrote a book about the history of horror cinema. This is my most favorite horror movie of all time.",Nosferatu

I already own the soundtrack score from a 1995 RCA/BMG cd, but combined with the moving images and 5.1 audio, Nosferatu now looks and sounds terrific. Although I must say I really enjoyed the excellent James Bernard score for the BFI release, this is the way it was intended to be heard back in the 1920s. Therefore, I highly recommend this splendid DVD and by buying it you support the hard work that went into its reconstruction and invest in future releases to come. Congratulations to Transit on their excellent work in restoring this and other classics, such as Battleship Potemkin, Metropolis or Der Golem et al. Well done!",Nosferatu
316,theeroticmonkey,A defining moment in history of horror,10,13 November 2007,"A hugely important film, not only for the horror genre but also for cinema itself. I saw the film at a very young age and Max Schreck's performance haunted my dreams for the years to come. He is truly brilliant as Nosferatu, the vampire, a massively chilling performance. The influence of this film can be seen all around us and despite it's age it is still one of my favourite films. The music is extremely atmospheric and despite there being no actual sound (such as dialogue or sound effects) the story is easily good enough to allow the lack of sound not to matter. The story itself is compelling and the main character turns in a fairly good performance. It is even fairly amusing in places. The film is a classic and anyone who believes themselves a film buff must see it.",Nosferatu
317,TimWagner3,Max Schreck's Indelible Performance Highlights Film,9,5 March 2012,"This Expressionist film was released in theaters 90 years ago, and its essential ability to scare people has not been diminished. Two people deserve credit for this accomplishment. The director, F.W. Murnau, captured a foreboding world behind the lens by the strong use of shadows and his keen ability to tell a story. The other person is Max Schreck, whose makeup and portrayal as the vampire continue to haunt people to this very day. I still find it hard to believe that his total screen time is less than 10 minutes. This is a testament to his strong screen presence. The film would not work without him.NOSFERATU is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula and the plot is very familiar to horror fans. The filmmakers did not receive permission from Stoker's widow, and as a result, some of the characters' names are changed. For example, Dracula became Orlok and Renfield became Knock. However, the plot was basically the same and she later sued because of copyright infringement. Anyway, the protagonist of the film is Thomas Hutter who works as a real estate employee. His boss, Knock, sends him to a Castle in the Carpathian Mountains. He must sell a house to the mysterious Count Orlok. Just by coincidence, the house for sale is next to Hutter's house in the German village. Hutter soon realizes that Orlok is a vampire after being attacked. The vampire rushes off to his newly purchased home, which is in ruin. He will spread a plague in the once peaceful village while attempting to defile Hutter's wife. Hutter must try to get back in time to protect the love of his life.A creepy atmosphere pervades the entire film. There is always a feeling of dread. The story is simple yet very effective. I always fear for Hutter because of his predicament. When he leaves the peaceful village and beautiful wife, Hutter has no idea what terror soon awaits him. In my mind, there is nothing scarier than being isolated in an ancient castle with a malevolent vampire. I could easily sense how alone Hutter truly was during his stay in the castle. After subsequent viewings, I can always feel the impending dangers as Hutter first sets out on his journey. Somewhere in the far distance there is a vampire awaiting his company.The film does have flaws. Some of the acting is exaggerated and laughable by today's standards, but you have to consider the time. The pacing is slow and may bore some people who do not appreciate silent films. You really need to have some patience and watch the film in the right frame of mind.If someone were watching this film for the first time, I would recommend finding a decent DVD release. This film has fallen into the public domain and there are some inferior prints out there. For advice on acquiring the best copy, you can visit the message board here and read different opinions. I also recommend the Werner Herzog remake from 1979, which I believe is a superior film. However, even though Klaus Kinski does a fine job of playing the infamous vampire, he cannot compete with Schreck's performance.P.S. According to the trivia section on this website, Max Schreck makes a cameo as a clerk without any makeup in Renfield's office towards the beginning. Hutter is seen talking to the clerk shortly before going into Renfield's office. In some prints, the man raises his head, in others he does not. This supposed cameo has been debated among horror aficionados, and while there is no official source for this, I believe that it is Schreck. Go watch and decide for yourself.",Nosferatu
318,zach-735-707860,A Noir Ancestor,8,11 May 2010,"The frights in this film may be contrary to what we are use to today, but I'm sure the audiences back then got a chill with the authentic and Gothic world of Nosferatu. While this film may not be considered very scary for our time, this film does experiment with techniques that would go on to influence the horror genre. Also the uses of black and white as well as lighting added not to just a horror atmosphere but a noir one as well. The use of contrasting black and white palettes and the use of shadows are early signs of the noir genre. Dracula could be seen as the murder in a noir gangster film. He even wears a dark jacket like those in dark gangster or other noir films. I also appreciated the metaphor of Dracula as death, referring to the German people's feeling about World War I. Dracula represents the death to the countries young and innocent. This film also managed to stay entertaining through all ninety four minutes of silent cinema. The dark settings were excellent set pieces for the dark terror. They created this Gothic reality the audience nor the characters could escape. However, the sets also give a certain real feel with the town locations. While many of the performances are whimsical and a little over the top, Max Schreck delivers a chilling and creepy performance as Dracula. Overall I believe this is a well done, entertaining old school silent film. A film that belongs to cinema art for its influences and ideas to horror and noir filmmakers and films alike. The story is faithful to the idea of Dracula, and the acting overall is reasonable for a silent film. The cinematography is this films strong suit, which is where other films have drawn most of their inspirations. A film forever remembered by cinema.",Nosferatu
319,subsct,"Awesome,just awesome",8,28 July 2012,First i have to recommend this movie to horror fans because when Nosferatu dies at the end it is scary.So the story is about John goes to Nosferatu's house to offer him a better one he finds himself letting Nosferatu to his town and everybody is scared and at the end when he dies it is pretty good for the 20s. but this is only recommended to horror fans and i am a horror fan i watches with 50 horror pack and i would pay for this movie on DVD so people who love horror check this movie out it is awesome.Oh yeah and one more thing see the remake to because it is not as good but it is still a really good movie and again for horror fans.,Nosferatu
320,rustyruss1982,Okay!,7,17 January 2004,"To tell you the truth I didn't particularly enjoy this film. I appreciate the film so much, it is definitely a stepping stone in cinema. But as a film to enjoy, Nosferatu is rather boring! The direction is superb, but the acting is dreadful. I suppose you could say I was being very harsh but this film is very high in the top 250. Personally I don't think it should be so high.",Nosferatu
321,mmfredette,Not Great,2,11 May 2004,"Worth seeing for its historical and trivial interest, but this is not a good movie. May have been in the '20's.The vampire is good... creepy.The story is illogical as presented here, sometimes downright ridiculous.It's technologically primitive, of course.They use shots of a hyena running around some trees to represent a werewolf. Awful. Maybe they figured that no one knew what a hyena looked like back then. I don't know. But it's embarrassing now.Bad acting, as you'll find in practically any non-comedy silent film (in comedies, the kind of super-swooning and super-laughing and super-everything they do in silents works because, well, it's funny). It's the physical equivalent to screaming for the entire movie.There is no way that this is one of the 250 best movies of all time. It has far more in common with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" than it does with ""The Godfather.""",Nosferatu
322,hoodnick,"I enjoyed this as a ""modern"" movie enthusiast with no knowledge about German expressionism.",8,16 September 2012,"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Nosferatu is the way it combines quality storytelling with moments of insight to contemporary filmmaking; even the most mundane and obvious occurrences require a strong emphasis of movement and facial expressions to properly depict a story with no sound. Above all else, this piece of German expressionism is a fascinating remnant from an era where the tropes and possibilities of the horror genre or filmmaking in general had yet to be established. In that regard, Murnau's vampiric tale from 1922 is of great historic value based on its reputation and influential nature alone. A question of relevance, however, is whether its ability to appeal and affect has been lost over the years; which is not the case in my personal opinion. Based on Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', the story accounts for a strange series of events in the fictional town of Wisborg where the protagonist Thomas Hutter lives with his wife Ellen. As he embarks on a journey to meet count Orlok and fulfill his duties as a real estate agent, certain irregularities lead him to believe that his client is no ordinary human being. As his suspicions turn out to be true he desperately hurries back to assure the safety of his wife and stop Nosferatu from making his demonic entrance into a town of innocent villagers.The narrative makes progress at a pace far slower than modern viewers might be used to but makes sure to remain focused, relevant and clear. Moments that fail to achieve any form of importance are easily forgiven as they tend to observe either architecture or hauntingly eerie forests at midnight. Whilst the picture quality is naturally muddled, the creepy and still effective visuals that rely on atmospheric shadowing and angles make the movie as a whole surprisingly approachable even 90 years after its release. You quickly get the impression that this is no hastily written Dracula rip-off but rather the creation of a pioneer with a strong sense of affection for the medium he's chosen. The director even created an epidemic plot device that does not exist in the original novel and adds perfectly to the narrative.Musically, an assessment is hard to make since the original score is mainly lost and several versions have been made ever since. As for my own viewing, I got an incredibly moody and appropriate soundtrack that more or less carried the entire movie on its shoulders and saved me from distractions and boredom. Another virtue of this creation is the excellent casting choice of Max Shreck as the antagonist. As previously mentioned, most actors need to deliver their performances in rather exaggerated manners in favor of coherence whilst count Orlok movies in an awkward, stale, and incredibly creepy manner. Most people have probably seen images or clips from some of the more iconic scenes that depict his ominous ascent in the stairway or perhaps the way he arises from his coffin – depictions that modern filmmakers still see as a source of inspiration.To sum things up, this is an old movie. It lacks the knowledge of modern visual techniques and devices but fares almost admiringly well without the tropes we cherish today. Gothic and beautiful book pages are scattered throughout the entire film to inform us of vampiric characteristics; formulated as poetically and hauntingly as possible. Each and every aspect of the film, from weird coloring to expressionist acting and Gothic approach adds to the insanely refreshing classical horror feel where you root for the potential victims rather than the antagonist.In many regards, classics are overrated. Criticizing them even on an amateurish level has become a cinematic taboo that most critics and individuals avoid. Nosferatu, on the other hand, sincerely deserves the vast amount of praise it has received; it's one of the few hauntingly grisly and poetic pieces of Gothic filmmaking that chose to tell a vampire tale in an era where it was neither predictable or cliché. I mean that as a most sincere compliment.",Nosferatu
323,MovieGuy87,All around good movie,10,14 October 2004,This movie created in 1922 was probably the best movie for 40 years after it was made. A really great silent film that combines a good story with some very good makeup. This black and white film has very good and very creepy music that makes it an instant horror classic. A movie for the old horror movie fans out there if you haven't already seen it. Max Schreck made this movie very scary with his makeup and haunting actions. The movie is made scary by using camera angles to only show shadows cast of the vampire about to strike. This would be a movie for older audiences to watch because of the horror violence and also because it is a silent film which would involve reading. Again probably the best movie of its time. I love this movie and I'm sure that most of those will hold it as a classic like i do. I give this movie **** out of ****.,Nosferatu
324,Boothegoo,"You start it, expecting some outdated piece of cinema, but you get a chilling peace of history. This movie will stick in your memory for years.",10,20 August 2013,"Nosferatu is one of the most influential horror movies ever made, and many movies own a lot to it, even it they don't know it. Even if Nosferatu isn't Original (More or less stolen from Dracula), it's still worth a watch and set the less popular image of a monster vampire instead of the other often handsome vampire (who own a lot to Stoker and Bela Lugosi). If you want a movie that still have the roots in German expressionism with out going nuts with it, this is the movie of it, there's scenes that keeps it pure, like shadows and certain camera angels, but unlike Doctor Caligari, I don't feel like it's go to the surreal. I don't think there's any need to summarize the plot since many people above me done it before. But i want to give huge credit to Max Schreck for the role of Orlok, he and Lugosi are the best actors when it comes to Dracula. I would also want to give credit to Alexander Granach, he made Renfield / Knock feel very alive, even 91 years later. If you watch this movie, turn down the lights, grab a drink, and just relax and let this creepy movie eat you, i would recommend watching many different editions of this movie, since the different musical scores give a different exercise.",Nosferatu
325,Floristan15,A Chilling Work of Art,8,18 April 2005,"Nosferatu. The very mention of the name strikes fear in ones heart, and so it should. This chilling master piece is one of the most frightening films created. Although silent, what it lacks in sound it makes up for in atmosphere. You shudder when the grotesque vampire comes on screen but cant help but watch due to the amazing costume and make-up. No cape was needed for this terrifying count, he makes our skin crawl without the use of blood and creepy accents. His very presence makes us want to reach for the light switch. The infamous scene when the vampire rises unaided from his chest is one of the most frightening images of a monster ever pictured. The feeding scenes are equally as frightening and allot we see no blood, little is left to the imagination. A historic master- piece. Well worth viewing.",Nosferatu
326,Evantheus,The precursor to modern horror,8,16 May 2005,"Yes, this film is the first horror movie ever, as far as I'm concerned. I have read comments from people noting that this film was boring, and uninteresting; however, such viewers simply have neither taste nor a sense of film history. Plain and simple, although this film may not be frightening by modern standards, this movie represents the basis upon which every vampire film is based.Although the silent format presents accellerated and exaggerated emotional and physical performances--and a soundtrack which leaves something to be desired--the overall ambiance of the film is that of absolute creepiness. People forget that the soundtrack/sound effects are meant only as an approximation, and supplement to the visuals.This is standard viewing for anyone interested in horror movies (even though I would categorize this film as a suspense thriller)... A fantastic film whose only shortcomings arise as a result of technological limitations of early 20th century cinema and, what I feel to be, an aprubt ending. Murnau succeeded in freaking out even the most modern and supposedly ""worldly"" of movie-goers.",Nosferatu
327,r-kreek,A classic that is worth to watch,9,8 February 2006,"I was afraid I would never see this movie because it is hard to come by. Although not too long ago I finally was able to see it, the legendary Nosferatu. The black and white sets the mood right at the beginning of the movie. The castle, landscapes, they all fit perfectly in the movie. Max Schreck truly plays evil creature as if the role was made for him. The bald head, the pointy ears, frightening eyes, long fingernails, he really is someone you don't want to meet in a dark alley.There is a little downside to the movie though, because it's black and white the movie can be somewhat confusing. Sometimes you thinks it's day, and Nosferatu is walking around in the sunlight. (personally I think those scene's were shot in the daytime). And that's weird because vampire die when they get into the sun. Also one funny scene is when the Nosferatu is running around town with his coffin under his arm.When considered all, this is still a wonderful movie that you have must seen at least once in your lifetime.",Nosferatu
328,QualityApeMan,The Film that Started the Vampire Craze,8,4 June 2018,"F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu might not be the first vampire film ever made, but it is the one that popularised vampires, making them a horror staple to this day.The story is inspired by Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (in fact the Stoker estate filed a lawsuit against the studio for plagiarism, but that's a story for another day). Estate agent Hutter is sent to the castle of Count Orlok to sell him a house in his home village of Wisborg, unaware that he is a vampire. After noticing a cameo of Hutter's wife, Ellen, Orlok takes a fancy to her and leaves for Wisborg after locking Hutter in the castle...As Nosferatu is a silent film, there are various accompanying scores available. The score on my Eureka Entertainment DVD is by French avant-garde band Art Zoyd. It's quite interesting to say the least - full of warm synthesizers, and unsettling industrial ambient noise. Overall I would say it works but I imagine it's nothing like the original scores.There are some nice special effects that add to the creep-factor: Orlok vanishes though closed doors, and use of stop-motion photography stands out (particularly where he loads the coffins onto the carriage and them climbs in himself). The use of shadows are also effective. I remember the scene where Orlok's shadow ascends the staircase from when I was a child. It was ingrained into my memory. Orlok's appearance is quite unique too. Nowadays we are used to the vampire's fangs being their canine teeth, but Orlok's are his front incisors, making him somewhat resemble a rat (which seem be drawn to him throughout the film unlike the typical bats).There are some amusing moments in the film. When there is talk of a werewolf prowling near the inn. When we finally see it it's just a hyena. No doubt the general public in 1922 didn't know what a hyena was so it would have looked really unusual and impressive. Oh well. The note that Knock peruses is bizarre too, adorned with illegible symbols. He seems to be able to read it fine though!Overall, Nosferatu is a bit dated nowadays but there is still enough interesting imagery for horror fans and others interested in film history. Recommended!",Nosferatu

I do not usually watch movies more than once, and I only own a few. However, this version of Dracula is the progenitor of all things Dracula. I watched this film with a friend in college, and was immediately drawn in. Since then, every film take on the Dracula story that I see is ruined. I have yet to see another version that can do anything beyond poor imitation of this original. Loved it. The final sequence is utterly fabulous. I really think that Max Schreck was a vampire.

334,peter_leonard_lee,Bit of a landmark movie.,7,6 March 2011,"Generally, I think recent movies are better than old movies. Most people who review these movies seem to disagree, as old movies tend to get higher ratings than modern movies. I watch a lot of movies - roughly about one a day - and I like watching old movies. I find old movies fascinating in the same way that I like to see how music has changed. But new movies are much more able to evoke emotions than old movies, though admittedly there's a lot of rubbish around. The picture quality now tends to be better, and the cinematography more advanced. Jaws, for instance, is so frightening because it matches what we do in our minds to frighten ourselves, and old movies generally fail to do this. Further, modern acting tends to be better and the scripts better - movies are now all-round more professionally done. Try watching the old and new versions of ""3:10 to Yuma"", end to end, if you disagree with what I say. That said, Nosferatu I think is really quite a good movie, well advanced of most other movies I've seen of the period - bit of a landmark in movie making, I'd say. It might be a bit clunky in scene changes & in other ways, but I think it's truly a bit chilling, which most horrors, including many modern horrors, fail to achieve.Try following this movie up by watching John Malkovich's & Willem Defoe's Shadow of the Vampire. It made me doubt my own view of reality, briefly. (I like films that do that - that make me think differently, if only for a while).",Nosferatu
335,Stephen-288,The Scariest Horror before the 'Talkies' (maybe spoilers),8,22 June 2004,"Boo! Nosferatu is chilling, thrilling and its silence but grand symphony gives the film a Gothic atmosphere. F.W.Murnau's direction is okay, the acting looks a bit corny, but of coarse it was silent and hard to make out what the performers were doing. But Max Shreck was outstanding (and Shreck, in German means fright or terror!) his vampire performance chills your bones. He was the first vampire to have fangs in a motion picture and is predicted to be the most effective vampire to this day.Murnau didn't have rights to make the film (if you haven't noticed, it is a copy of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' only with a few names changed) and in the end, Stoker's widow sued Murnau. All the prints were destroyed, but fortunately, or some people may say unfortunately the vampire survived! Murnau got away with a copy of Robert L. Stevenson's 'Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' with 'Der Januskopf'.The film's appearance, style and direction combined together is a masterpiece. I think it is the scariest horror film before the talkies, Max Shreck is so greatly devoted into his character you never see the mortal soul inside him! When I got the video, I was deeply disappointed because the 'digitally remastered' film was sepia all the way through, not a mixture of different filters like any other silent film.

337,timepilot3000,...Deathbird....,9,27 April 2016,"Stark. Surreal. Captivating. A few of the words I would feebly use to describe this film, a first and original of many categories that could be discussed for hours. First surviving vampire film. One of the original surviving horror films, this one set the early stage in not only silent film - but how rights to films and content will be set. This film was all but completely lost - as it was ordered destroyed due to unsecured rights associated with the original Dracula novel. By fate almost - one main copy and a few scraps of others have survived - amalgamated into what we can see today.The experience itself? If you haven't taken the time to watch it - it is a time capsule in many ways. With many period pieces, and older films it is necessary to place yourself in the shoes of not only one of the audience of the time it was released, but that of the filmmaker's interpretation of the period they are representing at the time the film was made to get the intended impact of the film. It is very captivating to see all the uses of production, setting, and manner used to convey this story - all shot in 1921. I think you could watch this 10 times and gain something new from it every time.Many have heard of the great silent acted performance of the character Count Orlock by Max Schreck as legendary. Words cannot surmise, how not only did he portray this being wholly - but did it without any prior example in a completely new form of medium. The character it'self, is an example of the raw folklore of the creature now a common place in pop culture. The performance of that entity being an organic representation at the root of this genre is plainly seen in this film. Its almost like being a film archaeologist, just watching it in the dark.Lastly, as I mentioned, imagine never seeing but one or two simple silent movies in your life. You go to the opera hall, to see this film, and take it all in. Imagine the terror of some of these dark folk tales come to life as light and shadow swoop all over stacking up corpses - and the soul of man and woman alike.

338,david-sprawson,Slow and boring,2,10 August 2008,"I have tried on several occasions to watch this film and have fallen asleep every time but one. It was shown on TV in the UK with a score specially written by James Bernard, who had written many of the great scores for the Hammer horror films. It was his music that kept me awake, so I managed to see the entire film for the first and only time. I consider that this is one of the most over-rated movies on IMDb. Maybe in 1922 it was a ground breaking experience but to the modern viewer it is painfully slow and hopelessly over acted. Max Schreck is the only actor who shows any, restraint  and he is the vampire and could possibly have got away with being a little bit over the top. His appearance and movements are the only reason to watch this old relic and the reason that I have given the film a 2. I have seen the restored DVD of this film on sale at ridiculous prices on the net and cannot imagine why anyone would pay that much to own this film.

Watch this in a darkened room and you probably be creeped out. (Incidentally,'Schreck',as I'm sure many people know, is a German word for 'fright' or 'terror'. This wasn't a publicity stunt! It was his real name.) It is true that Bela Lugosi's iconic performance in 'Dracula' immortalised him in film history and is very enjoyable (see my review for 'Dracula'), but it lacks the threat and downright evil of Schreck's.

Not only does ""Nosferatu"" scare the wits out of you, but it does so without words. For an actor to reach into your soul and drain your conception of reality with nothing more than movement and expression is a feat that no cinematic production of our modern era could hope to achieve.

I didn't have too many expectations going in other than what I already knew from seeing ""Doctor Caligari"". In the end this film definitely is impressive when looked at from the perspective of the time period it was made in. Without this critical detail the film can seem not necessarily bad, but almost bland. This is due to its use of what are now troupes to the horror genre, but at the time this was insanely innovative. The greatest aspects of the film have to be the fantastic character design of Count Orlok and the cinematography. The costume for Orlok is genuinely creepy and unsettling still to this day and the different parts that give him his look such as the bald head, long fingers, and hooked nose all come together for an innovative and fantastic character design. The cinematography is also extremely well done. Of course there is the iconic shot of Orlok slowly creeping up the stairs towards his victim, but there are others such as stills of the castle, Orlok looking out of the abandoned house towards Ellen, and the ship sailing that really are impressive. The key to understanding and appreciating this movie is all in acknowledging that it has flaws but for the time it created what we accept as the norm.Now while I have mentioned all these aspects I really enjoyed I'd have to say it's biggest flaw is the pacing and plot. It feels sort of all over the place and unnatural at times. Hutter jumps from place to place and they spend too long on parts that really don't have any significance such as Hutter watching the werewolf. It just isn't needed and doesn't really fit the movie. There are plenty of scenes and sections like this that really just leave me scratching my head asking why. I understand that there are still growing pains as most of these actors and directors in the time period are used to the medium of theater, but these just feel like bad writing and directing. It's boring and slows the movie a lot. This adds to what I feel is the biggest let down of the movie, which is that it feels like it really lacks suspense for a horror film.As I stated earlier my only other comparison for this film is ""The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari"" and ""Nosferatu"" compared to that I'd have to say I preferred the former. While it still suffered from similar pacing issues, it actually felt really suspenseful and like there was a semblance of horror and mystery to the film. It doesn't just feel like ""Nosferatu"" where you can expect everything. In ""Nosferatu"" everything is clear and predictable. It really just holds it back for me. A lot of what is supposed to be horror comes off as comical to me and just feels a little silly. Parts like the ""mosquito bites"" and Court Orlok remarking that Ellen has a ""lovely neck"" to Hutter feel very silly. While I don't necessarily love these parts I can respect them for what the achieved at the time, and the reason I feel they are funny now is because this film solidified these as troupes that were innovative at the time.This film's greatest achievement is the influence it has left for all filmmakers that came after. It isn't perfect at all, but it really excels at many of the aspects that it really could at the time. I'd overall say the film is a 6/10.",Nosferatu

345,BloodSucker X13,Dracula gone german.,10,4 November 2001,Brilliant.This Film is great every film buff or vampire lover should see this movie at least twice. F.W. Murnau is a genius. Max Schreck was superb as Count Orlock. And being how new Cinema was when this Film was released the special effects were amazing.,Nosferatu
346,cpetrizzi,A Visual Treat for the True Synaesthetic,10,10 April 2010,"I wonder what it would have been like seeing this in a theater in 1922. Maybe with a date? Would you have had nightmares for weeks? Would she have? I think the answer would have been a resounding YES! Silent film or not, Nosferatu will bring chills up and down your spine. The performance of Max Schreck reveals his attention to detail as one of the original method actors.The movie opens on a town bathed in sepia tones coupled with flute-like sounds wrapped in semi-upbeat music. This is Ellen and Hutter's hopeful theme. Hutter presents his beautiful wife with freshly picked flowers upon her asking ""why did he kill them""? We are faced almost immediately with foreshadowing of what's to come. Sepia tones continue with Knock proposing to Hutter the idea of ""making a pretty penny"" with selling the house across the street.As Hutter gets ready to travel to meet Count Orlock, Ellen's face at the doorway is filled with concern, and then they embrace with a kiss. The film then alternates between blue and sepia hues upon his journey, with a showing of dogs on the path. The joy and innocence exuding from Butter's face reminds me of Begnini's spirit throughout the 1997 movie ""Life is Beautiful."" The ending share similar qualities, too.The music changes to deeply ominous, foreboding tones of the didgeridoo, coupled with intermittent dissonant long tones. Then the original melody is sped up to signify the impending nighttime when ""unnatural deeds"" occur. After Butter crosses the bridge into the pass, he is met by a carriage driven by a character emulating Count Orlock. The horses are even shrouded to cover their hideous sights. Then Butter meets up with Count Orlock who tells him that it is late and his ""servants are asleep."" There is even a reddish scene. .....wonder what this means for later.End of Act 1.So much about this movie screams MASTERPIECE! Sound, lighting, color, makeup, thematic melodies, graininess of the film, and acting. I haven't seen enough silent films to compare, but for me Nosferatu hit all the right chords, figuratively and literally. The only complaint, and it's very superficial, is that the music had similar qualities of the synthesized tones from the early computer video game ""King's Quest,"" oddly enough. This experience has made me appreciate silent films more.",Nosferatu
347,garrett-cypert,A Fine Example of German Expressionism and a Grotesque Twist on a Classic Tale,8,15 November 2007,"F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is arguably one of the most horrific adaptations of Bram Stoker's Dracula ever produced for film. In order to better understand the reasons for my 8 out of 10 ranking, I will first explain how it's characteristics of expressionism make it fit in with other films released in Germany during the 1920s. Then, I will explain the most obvious and key difference between this film and other Dracula films. Finally, I will briefly describe how Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes has withstood the test of time, on the screen and in the courtroom.The period between about 1919 and the rise of the German Nazi movement in 1933 was a time of what is now known as The German Golden Age of film-making. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is one of the landmark films made in Germany during this golden age. Of course, the beginning of the German Golden Age was when the horrifying masterpiece Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari was released in 1919. This was one of the first attempts at what is now called expressionism in film-making. Expressionism is defined as aesthetics in which ideas and feelings are shown through exaggerated elements in the image such as lighting, decor, and content. Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari took expressionism to the extreme with the use of carefully constructed indoor sets that made everything on screen seem distorted and anti-real. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes, released 3 years later, brought to its audience very exaggerated shots (extremely tall beds, misshapen windows, grotesque makeup, exaggerated shadows, etc.). But one of the main differences between Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes and Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari is the amount of screen time that shows nature. Many of the expressionist shots in Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes where outside, depicting some of the abnormalities in nature. This is an important element when discussing this film because it puts a rather disturbing twist on the natural world that contributes to a pessimistic air throughout the movie. For instance, when the hyena is shown, its simply unattractive appearance and disproportionate body adds to the film a sense that something is not quite right with the current situation. In most films it is a relief to see shots of trees or of the horizon, but Murnau proves with Nosferatu that this does not have to be necessarily true. Many of the most disquieting shots where actually shot outside for instance, the long shot of the castle, and the scarecrow shot. The expressionism in Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is obviously there, which puts this film rightfully so in the realm of the German Golden Age, which is characterized by a strong emphasis on expressionism.Next, it is important to realize that one of the foremost reasons that this film has become such a memorable film is because it does not show Dracula as he is usually depicted. This unauthorized version of the 1897 novel does not portray the count as a handsome, deceiving man. Instead, the antagonist (Count Orlok as he is called instead of Dracula because it is an unofficial adaptation of the novel) is as ugly and unattractive as a count can be. With his rat-like appearance, Max Schreck certainly gives the movie a dark feel. Just the appearance of this Orlok on the screen is enough to scare viewers, even if he is not actually doing something horrific while on screen. Schreck is simply horrifying to watch. If someone is on screen for no more than 10 minutes total and can have an entire movie made around their character, they must me one sick looking puppy.As stated above, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is an UNOFFICIAL adaptation of Bram Stoker's original Dracula novel. I think that because of this, Count Orlok has been created into this sort of rebellious icon that seems to constantly lurk (much as he does on the actual film) behind all of the other, ""pretty-boy"" vampires. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes has become a sort of cult classic not only because of its extreme appearance of the count himself, but also because of the persecution it has endured over the past century. The Prana-Film Company declared bankruptcy after Bram Stoker's estate acted for his widow, Florence Stoker, and sued for copyright infringement. The Stoker estate won the case and the court ordered all existing prints of Nosferatu destroyed. Luckily, copies of the film had already been distributed around the world. These prints were then copied over the years, helping Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes gain its current reputation as one of the greatest movie adaptations of the vampire legend. When most people think of silent horror films, their minds immediately recall that horrifying image of Count Orlok towering in the doorway of a dimly lit room or rising from his casket staring forebodingly into the camera.Through the use of deliberate expressionism, alterations of a classic story, and a nasty battle in lawsuits, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes proves that it is a must-see film for any true movie fan.",Nosferatu
348,marco-ricaldi,"""Nosferatu"" A glimpse of our first theatrical Vampire",8,4 December 2007,"""Nosferatu"" is a wonderful film that was made in 1922. The director of the film was F.W. Murnau, who based his film loosely on the novel ""Dracula"" written by Bram Stoker. The film later came into legal problems with the movie rights or licensing because the film was based on the book without authorization. Even with certain names being changed like Count Dracula to Count Orlock, you can still get a sense of who they are referencing to from the book within the movie. The same goes for the other characters that are portrayed in the film. Max Shreck who plays Count Dracula in the film ""Nosferatu"" leaves you with an incredible image of what might a real vampire might look like. Since I have never seen the movie until now, I was mesmerized by the detail that went into the character of Count Dracula. Details such as pointy ears, long fingers and fingernails, and never blinking within the movie made this film unique in the 1920's film era. Having read the book ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker you see where Murnau got his ideas on his movie from the book. The film doesn't go by the book quite exactly which helps shed new light on how Murnau's version of the story is for him. Certain shots throughout the film were fascinating. Shots that I noticed that were quite interesting to me were how they made Count Dracula fade in and out of certain shots within the film. It was an incredible special effect that I have never seen done on a black and white film made in the 1920's. Furthermore, to see on the shots taken where Jonathan Harker is picked up by the phantoms is baffling. The scene depicts the horse carriage moving extremely fast, while everything else is moving in normal time. I also thought the shot taken on the boat where Count Dracula arises from his coffin straight as a board was an impressive take. You do not see any strings or wires to help him make such a move, so it leaves you to wonder how they thought of doing that without making it noticeable on film. One other shot that was impressive in my opinion was the scene where Count Dracula is walking up the stairs in the mansion that the Harker's live in. It is interesting the way you see his shadow ascends up the stairs on the wall and the shadows of his arms stretch along the wall into the room and onto Mina. All of these were incredible effects done in this film, which makes you wonder how they shot them in the year that they made this film. I noticed that through out this film Murnau shot a lot of shots at eye level form. I would say that eighty percent of this movie is shot at eye level. He did use some low angle shots though, like when they are shooting Renfield on top of the roof of the building trying to get away from the police that are trying to put him back in the asylum. He even used high angle shots within the film that I noticed only twice. Once when Harker is at Dracula's castle looking down through a window watching these men load piles of earth into these coffins, and even see's Dracula himself get into one of the coffins. It is also another time within the film that is depicted by fast movement of people doing actions in this fast pace motion. Another time he uses a high angle shot is when he shoots the scene where Harker see the town people caring coffins of their loved ones down the street that have died from this plaque that they have thought has infected their town. The film was well shot though, especially beginning and ending every shot with the picture looking through a peep hole getting smaller to bigger or bigger to smaller. One thing in the film that I thought was kind of a problem was that since it is filmed in black and white you could not really tell if it was night time. Because the filmmakers shot everything in the day, it was difficult to depict day time scenes from night time scenes. In some scenes you see Dracula walking around outside when it looks like it is daytime with the sun up, but you know that it could not be possible due to the fact that if it was so Dracula would be dead. So in that sense you just had to know that it was night time all the times you see Dracula within the film until the end. I also found the music to be quite odd in this movie. Some parts of the film had wonderful music to go along with the story, but then there were other parts that seemed different from what I have ever seen done in a silent film. I noticed that Murnau was trying to go for something out of the norm, and more into something that was unique and different with the music and sounds that were put into this film. Overall the movie was an amazing film made for its time. It was extremely thought out with great detail and cinematography. I was incredible impressed with how the film was put together to do such special effects for its time. For anyone who likes old movies and the story of Dracula, ""Nosferatu"" is a must see film.",Nosferatu
349,DethbyHashi,A Gothic Piece of Art History,10,6 February 2011,"This unauthorized silent production of Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"" may not be the most faithful film version but it is truly the most haunting and provocative interpretation to this date. For its time ""Nosferatu"" is a masterful visual experience, most remembered for its boat scene in which Nosferatu rises from his crate and stalks along the deck of the ship. Although Max Scheck in the title role steals every scene he creeps into, everyone in the film puts on unforgettable performances. For those of you who are unsure about watching Nosferatu because it is a silent film, viewing it is an emotional, dreamlike experience. It's similar to the experience of a ballet where you feel the energy and emotion through the music, and the players, not through direct word. Over the years, ""Nosferatu"" has reached out with his long, boney, shadowy fingers and influenced everything from the horror/fantasy genre to Hollywood Blockbusters to even family movies.",Nosferatu
350,lindy-n-perrin,Expressionism in Nosferatu,8,9 February 2009,"Each generation has a different Dracula. When F. W. Murnau directed Henrik Galeen's adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror in 1922, he created a Dracula for the German expressionist community. Through both acting and editing, the director used the camera to focus on particular emotions that both actors and audiences were feeling.Throughout the film, the camera remains stationary. This mise-en-scène only allowed the audience in on what Murnau wants the audience to see and feel. Emotional moments in which the vampire is about to attack Jonathon in his sleep are inter-laced with that of Nina waking from a dream to warn him of the attack. Nothing else in the two rooms can be seen, forcing the audience to focus their attention on the action taking place before the camera. This drawn-out suspense is felt by both audience and characters.Another editing example that evoked emotion involved Jonathon observing Nosferatu's late-night preparations for his journey to England. Jonathon watched Nosferatu from his bedroom window as the vampire loaded what looks like coffins onto the back of a horse-drawn carriage. Murnau slowed down the filming process to make the vampire appear as if he was moving faster than humanly possible. Cuts between Jonathon's horrified but curious face are inter-laced with the activity outside his bedroom window. Finally, the vampire is seen climbing into the final coffin and closing the lid. The horse-drawn carriage leaves the castle grounds and Jonathon is on his own to escape. Also, ""special effects"" add to the fantasy that is Dracula through the technology of editing. In one scene, the vampire appears out of thin air before a terrified Jonathon. Also in the death scene of the monster, the director created the illusion that the sunlight radiating from a window evaporated him into nothing but a puff of smoke on the floor. What is interesting in that shot is the director's ability to make the vampire slowly dissolves, starting with his fingers and ending with the smoke. An example of an actor's wardrobe and make-up giving off a strong emotion is seen in the horrifying appearance of Nosferatu himself. Count Orlok appears almost rat-like. His elongated nose and sharp, pointy teeth give his face the impression of a rodent. Murnau used Nosferatu's long, skinny fingers to cast shadows upon the walls in order to ""creep"" out the audience and give an impression of a crawling monster waiting in the shadows. Multiple shots found in the film give the impression of a slithery movement whenever Nosferatu moves about the screen. His arms are stationary at his side and his fingers spread out, as if ready to attack. This induced a fear in both characters and audience. This fear is only intensified when appearance meets movement, creating an understanding that the monster is not natural. Nosferatu's appearance makes it very clear that he is the monster of the film and is to be feared. Later vampires that would come across American screens would take the fantasy vampire in a real world in Nosferatu, and create a life-like human vampire in a fantasy world. The vampires would become sexier and more desirable to our American fantasies and less bazaar. In German expressionism, the audience feared the monster for how unhuman-like he appeared. In American films, the actions of the vampire first makes the audience desire the vampire, making fear a secondary emotion.Strong emotions can also be communicated through the exaggerated acting of the characters. One character in particular is that of Renfield. Renfield, who could be considered Nosferatu's devoted servant, is locked in an asylum. He senses his master's return and becomes unruly. The actor must exhibit skills that would lead the audience to understand his lunacy without the use of dialogue cards. His uniform was shabby and his hair was unkept, which would be considered consistent with a lunatic's inability to care for himself. Also, Renfield is eating flies when the doctor enters the room. His wide eyes dart around the room in an insane manner. His ""desire"" for blood even leads him to attack the doctor. His wild-beast-like movements (jumping from the floor onto the bed, crouching on the bed as if ready to attack anyone who comes near) only lead to a greater understanding of the character's insanity.This film was the first known adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Even though small elements are different in the movie (the death of Dracula) and some are all together missing (no wolves who are friends of the vampire, the death of Lucy, and the three vampire women) the over-all emotional portrayal of the story is present. The appearance of the character of Nosferatu greatly resembles that of the vampire in the book. The movie's vampire would differ from our American culture some years later when American idealism would saturate the movie industry. Our vampires would become more beautiful and sophisticated. But that is our generation seeing the story through our idealism.Overall, this movie is a good example of expressionism in Germany. It is worth the time to watch this film. This film is a great short summary of Stoker's book Dracula for those who want a ""condensed"" version of the classic  or those who just like classic silent films.",Nosferatu
351,ronsabol,"""Great"" in it's day, but pretty laughable now.",2,18 September 2018,"I'll be short: This film is no masterpiece, nor is it great by any stretch of the imagination. Orlock's look makes it a standout, but beyond that, it's pretty awful. Goofy acting and a score that only seems to truly accommodate the film maybe 25% of the time, makes this movie rather funny for the most part.",Nosferatu
352,amazingadam11,Or lok?,10,12 November 2015,"One of cinemas finest achievements. Watching the original Nosferatu kind of scares me in a peculiar way, lighting effects play a major part in that. The story is nothing new these days, but if you watch it from the eyes of someone who saw it in 1920's it feel remarkable. The Masters of Cinema release I watched was beautiful, perfect score and excellent title cards. I can't find any reason not to watch this, I mean the film is short and it certainly flies bye. Most humans I know haven't seen this so I would recommend getting your hands on it and watching as soon as you can. At least it's still a better love story than Twilight.",Nosferatu
353,zewrak,Beware of all clones and bad copies.,10,5 February 2003,"This movie, since its one of the most known vampire movies out there and one of the true crowns in the horror genre has alot of bad copies and ""copycats"" when you buy this movie, make sure you get the black and white original. There has been a few releases where they have tried to colorize it, which totally ruined the movie itself.I know there is atleast one good copy on DVD though. With only the music recreated with a modern orchestra. Once again beware, there are also copies that have added new music as in electronic music with samples where they even try to put some whispers and monologs into the background.
So make sure the DVD case states clearly that it is the original B&W with real orchestras playing the music.",Nosferatu
354,smmoynihan,Disturbing and artful,9,23 May 2012,"Nosferatu a German expressionist horror film. It is one of the first silent films I ever viewed. I found it to be emotional,creepy, disturbing, artful, and beautiful. By far my favorite vampire film. Although this is a silent film the eerie music,strong sexual subtext, and the use of fast-motion and negative photography makes the film very visually pleasing and captivating. Fritz Arno Wagner brings terror out of silhouettes. It's definitely more haunting than scary. Of course thew best seen is Orlok is standing in the doorway of Hutter's bedroom. Overall Nosferatu is a iconic, emotional and visual treat. My biggest gripe is it is very difficult to find a decent copy of the film.",Nosferatu
355,Nemesis69,Beware The DVD's,7,31 December 2004,"I had seen this movie on cable several years back and it had, to me a very weird and somewhat spooky soundtrack. However, as zorak-10 and others had mentioned earlier, there are some DVD releases of this film that were colorized, and or had different soundtracks from the original release. While this DVD I picked up was still in black and white, it had the names of all the characters changed to match those in the book, so Orlock is called Count Dracula, Hutter is Harker and Greta is Nina as they were in the original Dracula novel. Still, anyone who is a true horror fan should see some of the originals and this one stands out as that.",Nosferatu

Nearing his destination in the Carpathian mountains, Hutter stops at an inn for dinner. The locals become frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name and discourage him from traveling to his castle at night, warning of a werewolf on the prowl. The next morning, Hutter takes a coach to a high mountain pass, but the coachmen decline to take him any further than the bridge as nightfall is approaching. A black-swathed coach appears after Hutter crosses the bridge and the coachman gestures for him to climb aboard. Hutter is welcomed at a castle by Count Orlok.

A stunning work of visual art, so glad it wasn't actually destroyed when they tried. The use of light and dark, casting shadows in particular is exceptional. Very much an excellent example of the Expressionist movement of it's day. The fact that this film is up for another release almost a century after it was made is testament to it's beauty, influence and artistry. Even with it's deviations from the plot it is still my favorite, if unofficial adaption of Dracula, and likely still my favorite vampire design with it's creepy rodent qualities adding to the unnerving feel of the entire piece.",Nosferatu

The word ""masterpiece"" is used a lot, but Nosferatu has truly earned that title. It is a great example of Greman expressionism. Max Schreck was truly at his best. Schreck's portrayal of the head vampire rivals that of Bela Lugosi in the later 1931 talking film, ""Dracula.""Considering the technological limitations of the 1920's, the film was well made. If you are new to silent films, I strongly recommend Nosferatu.",Nosferatu
359,tom-w-lloyd,The Original Vampyr,9,10 February 2021,"For a film as renowned as Nosferatu, there is nothing I can add which hasn't been said a thousand times before. Despite this, after recently rewatching this masterpiece of silent cinema, I felt compelled to add my voice to the slew of admiration and critique that has come before. It's influence on horror, and film in general, is undeniable, and the line up of Universal monsters from the 1930s owes a great deal to not just this, but the wider wave of gothic and expressionist cinema of the Weimar Republic.For contemporary audiences, Nosferatu has lost none of its impact. It is astounding that a film quickly approaching its first centennial does not feel remotely dated. In fact, the flickering black and white imagery emanates a timeless, almost ethereal quality, offering up a portal into a shadowy world of nightly creatures and a permeating sense of death.By 1922, when Nosferatu was unleashed on the German populace, Murnau was already an accomplished director, with a diverse variety of films under his belt. It's unfortunate that most of those are now lost, a fate which Nosferatu narrowly escaped after a copyright related lawsuit ended with the demand that all copies be destroyed. I'm grateful, along with the rest of the film community, that this decree went unfulfilled.While aeons away from the alluring charm of Bela Lugosi's Dracula of 1931, Max Schreck's half-rodent-half-bat creature of the night is no less impactful. With taloned claws that cast groping shadows in the moonlight, and a piercing deathlike stare which hypnotises the viewer as he does his victims, he emanates an eerie predator-like presence. His lust for 'pretty necks' and the 'hellish life-potion' which flows within, is evident from the first time he materialises onto the screen out of the encroaching darkness.The looming shadows of the vampyr himself is only one aspect of the striking imagery on display. Hordes of rats, spiders and carnivorous plants devouring prey, even a microscopic polyp consuming oblivious specks in its watery domain, give a realistic edge to the horror, a far superior touch to the 'rubber bats on strings' found in Hollywood the following decade. Other scenes which leave a lasting impression include the forlorn Ellen finding solace on a patch of sand surrounded by wooden crosses, and the cursed ship which floats ghost-like into Wisborg harbour.Tying everything together is Hans Edermann's hauntingly beautiful score, which compliments the imagery and propels the story, elevating each element into a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts. I can only imagine the awe and terror beheld by the original audiences as the arched entrance of Hutter's bedroom-cum-prison is filled with the looming presence of Count Orlok, while the pounding of drums and the blaring of brass resonates through the cinema hall.For those that experience Nosferatu it will leave a lasting impression. The combination of haunting cinematography, striking score and an iconic creature of the night could hardly be bettered. It truly is A Symphony Of Horror!",Nosferatu
360,ktesta60,Nosferatu: a horror classic,10,26 August 2014,"In my opinion, Nosferatu is one of those movies no matter how many times someone remakes it or tries to take the story line from it, it will always be an original horror classic. When you think of a vampires, the first thing that pops into your head is instantly Dracula. But for lovers of horror, its two mysterious dwellers, Dracula by Braum Stroker and the horror classic Nosferatu. Nosferatu is instantly remembered by one of the most classic vampires movies. Though, Nosferatu may not be for everyone due to the fact that it is a silent film and it is not in color. But anyone who is into classic films, especially horror I recommend Nosferatu, because to me it's one of the most classic foreign horror films out there.",Nosferatu
361,expertgame,This one was extraordinary.,10,24 April 2015,"This is the granddaddy of every horror movie and one of the best. Seriously, it's still scary, well-made and enjoyable. Max Schreck plays one of the greatest villains ever. No emotions, no motivations, no introspection, just a freaky living corpse sucking your blood.The flaws are little and rare, the only bad thing is overacting. But this was great and probably really scary for the '20s.F.W. Murnau is a true cinema master and probably Nosferatu is his masterpiece. And - my opinion - probably the movie with the bast vampire teeth ever.Aniway, this movie actually introduced the fact that vampires burn exposed at sunlight. And i have to say Orlok is better than Lugosi's Dracula.I recommend you the colorized 1995 and 2005 versions.",Nosferatu
362,marapese-96327,Nosferatu is genre definer,8,1 September 2016,"F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" is a genre defining horror film that was far ahead of its time. Much like most of the German films that came out in and around the 1920's, this film was heavily influenced by the end of WWI and was part of the German expressionist movement. Murnau used multiple editing techniques, most notably the montage, that were far from as common as they are today. Although the scare factor of the monster's reveal hasn't quite stood the test of time with the huge technological advances we have made in the last century, there is no denying the brilliance and the effect ""Nosferatu"" has had on the horror genre as a whole.",Nosferatu
363,mghm5000,Nosferatu--language and music,10,27 August 2005,"""Nosferatu..."" is an excellent example of an actor understanding the part so well, that the body language alone delivers the message. Schreck's creature becomes a snapshot memory, which is something very rare, even with all of today's gadgetry and technology. It has had so many countless imitations, albeit, many imitations not even realized as such by those who created them due to the timelessness of what Murnau and Schreck created (an example would be the nonhuman-like movements seen in many of today's Horror movies--jarred and ""creepy"" body movements seen in movies like ""The Ring"" and ""Fear dot com"", and the body images seen in many rock videos like those by Mariyln Manson and Steve Vai). So it is fair to say that ""Nosferatu..."" was a very progressive movie in its day, sexually charged and new. Also very progressive was the music that accompanied the film--dissonant chords abound, with a balance of symphony and American-influenced bass and ""traps"", creating an unsettling mix that keeps one on edge. Germany at that time was rich in the arts, but the music heard in ""Nosferatu..."" was very forward even in such a progressive cultural state.",Nosferatu

365,zentiger16,A piece of classic horror that all should see at least once!,10,16 November 2005,"Where would we be without this film? This is truly classic suspense! There is some great acting in the flick especially by Max Shreck who plays Count Orlock. The wonderful direction by F.W. Murnau make for a creepy,fun and interesting film even if it is a silent movie. The effects and makeup were top of the line for the time (and most still hold up well to this day!) This is a must see film for any horror fan that wants to know more about the history of the genre. The influences are still being felt from this groundbreaking film and vampire fans will find this wonderful creation priceless . This is the first film (or at least the first remaining) to be based on the classic novel Dracula. Be sure to catch 'Shadow of a Vampire ' which is based on the ""behind the scenes"" tales of the making of this film.",Nosferatu
366,i_love_kong,Masterpiece,8,20 November 2005,"This truly is a BRILLIANT film. FW Murnau's use of shadows makes this film one of the most frightening vampire films. Max Schreck portrays the vampire excellently and I think that the character of 'Count Orlok' is the only screen vampire to date that actually shows how terrifying Dracula was to be intended. I mean, come on! How scary is Bela Lugosi or Frank Langella? Thank God Florence Stoker didn't get all copies of this masterpiece destroyed! I also think that the Orlok character makeup looks a hell of a lot like John Barrymore's Mr Hyde makeup form Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1920 version). This would be one of my all time favourite films and I highly recommend it to horror fans or silent movie fans.",Nosferatu
367,dking987,dking987's review of Nosferatu,8,25 September 2008,"Very good, i liked it of course, the fact that it is in black and white, means that the film going generation of today wouldn't consider this such a great film, to what it truly is...all together, with the special effects, and its early date (1922), this is a work of genius. it is also pre WW2, and German, meaning some aspect's of the story, other than Bram Stoker's Dracula, came from the depression, that Germany was at the time, and because of this, subtle clues and idea's, ranging from Anti-Semeticism to exist within the film (Orlok's Image, also, it was the time for persecution to begin).Overall: 8/10",Nosferatu
368,topiniskala,Horror masterpiece and my favourite film of all time!,10,9 May 2018,"I feel I might not be the best person to review this film, because as the title suggests, this is my favourite film of all time and thus I really cannot stay objective. I saw Nosferatu for the first time when I was 12 years old and it was my first proper horror film and had a massive impact on me growing up.Nosferatu is (as far as I know) the oldest surviving vampire film and the first proper on-screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, even though Murnau made heavy changes to the plot and switched all of the names. The christian and patriarchal overtones of the original novel have here been switched into a more directly sexualized approach. The vampire is not repelled by crosses or other religious symbols, but instead is finally vanguished by the rays of the morning sun after giving in to his lust for Ellen. Also while in the original novel and later Dracula movies Van Helsing is a central figure on the plot and appears as a wise and paternal teacher, here he is more of a doting old man who in the end is largely useless against the vampiric menace. The vampire Count Orlock is also switched from the usually depicted more noble gentleman to a ghoulish, ratlike and shrivelled fiend with very few human characteristics. He is also much more associated with plague and disease, which actually is more closely related to older European vampire legends rather than the Stoker novel. This depiction of evil as a plague and disease spreading over civilization is also a common theme in Murnau films overall.This film has been often associated with the German expressionist movement and while yes, I do agree that the film has a strong expressionist streak going through it, it also at times brings to ming the older German Romantic art of the 19th century. Actually a lot of the nature scenery especially has a strong resemblance to paintings by Caspar David Friedrich. There's also a lot great use of shadows and architectural shapes across this film and the acting, while very much dated, definitely has it's moments. Max Schreck is brilliant as the ghoulish vampire, Gustav Von Wangenheim goes through a believable (though exaggerated) transition from a careless and naive youth to an adult and Greta Schröder as overly sensitive and pained Ellen is actually really good also and definitely should get more recognition. Of course with this being a silent film it's hard to say anything about the sound, but after hearing the original score for the film I have to say that the musically this film is absolutely spot on. Just cacophonous and noisy enough to be unnerving, without going too abstract. The mood of this film is definitely it's greatest asset. Watching this alone in the dark at night puts you in a really weird and freaked out mood. The whole film has this slow burning heavy pace that feels almost ritualistic, slowly building into the unbearably intense finale. Of course you shouldn't expect jumpscares or really any kind of obvious scare tactics with a film this old, but give it a chance and take it seriously, and it will creep under your skin and haunt you for a long time. I remember watching this for the first time alone at night when I was twelve and being obsessed by it afterwards for weeks. It definitely sparked my lifelong love affair with the horror genre and helped me get into writers such as HP Lovecraft, and all kinds of darker and more sinister art, cinema, literature and music.So yeah, an essential horror classic that everyone should see and my all time favourite film. Just be prepared that due to the age of this film it might require more effort than just making popcorn on your part. Set the mood right and this film can turn into an unforgettable experience. Also make sure that you have a good quality print to watch, as many of the cheaper public domain versions have an atrocious image quality and often very random music choices. Personally I recommend the Eureka Masters Of Cinema version, as it is a very good restoration and has the original orchestral score.",Nosferatu
369,sanchodesu,Art Zoyd Made Me Die Inside,3,8 February 2006,"As a historical landmark in film, Nosferatu undoubtedly stands tall: it marks the birth of the horror genre, and the first film to experiment with the art of unsettling the human mind. An entire genre and huge amount of film technique owes itself to this movie and its ilk. Nosferatu is one of the most important pieces in the early days of film.However, as a movie itself, it is at some intervals funny where it is not meant to be, and at others just irritating and painful.A lot of the pain for me, I will allow, probably came from the soundtrack. I had to watch this movie for a film class and it was played with the Art Zoyd soundtrack on the Kino version, which I suppose meant to unsettle and frighten the listener, but in fact was sort of like Bjork farting through her mouth mixed with the sound of scissors cutting paper mixed with the sound of car alarms, and once they settled on a particular Bjork-car alarm mix, they would stick with it for a good fifteen minutes or so, even if nothing of particular interest was happening. The sound of car alarms, I find, makes me very angry, and when it goes on for fifteen minutes or so, it makes me want to throw up. After over an hour of this sort of assault on my brains, I was dying inside.However, I was aware as I was watching that it was not only the soundtrack that I found unappealing. In between the major points of the storyline, there are large tracts of nothing in which there are only alternating shots of scenery, boats, and people milling around or traveling, destroying what little suspense there might have been. The main character somehow manages to be annoyingly idiotic and treacly even though we can't hear what he says; his wife is so melodramatic it is either humorous or tiring. The only good actor in the film is Max Schreck, and, to be honest, I found his appearance more funny than frightening. The movie set me up to ridicule it with its poncy opening and I couldn't get out of the mood.For its time, the movie is terribly good. For our time, the movie is at best a nostalgic remnant, and on average not horrifying or entertaining. It deserves the cult following it has gathered in regard to the greatness it once had, but as with many things, greatness fades. For the general audience, Nosferatu is a movie landmark to be seen mainly out of interest in film history, not as a method of entertainment.",Nosferatu

371,jack_jenkins91,A classic horror which makes you realise how crap most of todays movies are,9,22 March 2006,"I love this film, it makes me wonder why they bother with Jason and all when they have classic horror villains like this.The movie is incredible, the use of shadow and the ugliness of Max Shreck (RIP :() are truly well done. It was pretty scary when i saw it when i was younger but now i just admire the classic moments again as it never grows tiresome. Though it isn't without its flaws, the acting is parts is god damn awful even for its time and the soundtrack for the remastered version was terrible, how you can mix rock music with a 1922 classic silent movie and keep up the same atmosphere is impossible, they deserved to get sued as well for taking Stoker's work without permission but luckily a few copies survived the process when they were ordered to be destroyed Overall though pure excellence and if your tired of all the modern day rubbish horrors today check this one out",Nosferatu
