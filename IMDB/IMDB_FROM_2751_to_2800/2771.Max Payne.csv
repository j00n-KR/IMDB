0,bkoganbing,Some special killers,5,20 March 2015,"Watching Max Payne I did not realize it was based on a video game character until reading about it here. Then certain things began to make sense and I put myself in the place of the protagonist/hero that Mark Wahlberg plays. A lot of it made sense even to me who is of an age where one did not play video games in their formative years.Wahlberg's Max Payne is a detective down in cold case now. He requested a transfer there, not a plumb assignment but one that leaves you with a lot of time on your hands. Time enough to study cases and develop patterns and similarities if one is looking for some special killers. In this case it was Wahlberg's wife and daughter. The late wife wife worked for a pharmaceutical company and it was over her job that she was killed. They've developed a drug for the military which given to soldiers just eliminates fear from the equation. You can fight off just about anything except a directly fatal wound. It's also highly addictive and you'll do just about anything to get it. If you don't get it some dark fantasies come your way.I have to give credit to Mark Wahlberg here. This film maybe based on a video game fantasy but at no time does Wahlberg become a cartoon like caricature. He also gets some good support from Donal Logue as his former partner, Beau Bridges as the former head of security at the victim's job and one deadly female assassin in Mila Kunis. That woman is in a role far from the emptyheaded cheerleader she played in That Seventies Show. She's originally hunting Wahlberg thinking he might have been part of the killing of her sister who's gotten into that drug. But they join forces against the bad guys.Remember this film is a fantasy and for a mass audience and it's hardly Oscar material. Still I have to give credit to Wahlberg and the cast for putting some dimensions into cartoon like characters.",Max Payne
1,Leofwine_draca,Noisy and generic shoot-em-up,5,6 August 2012,"MAX PAYNE is the movie adaptation of a popular video game. And if that's not enough to put you off watching it, I don't know what is. Game adaptations don't have the best cinematic reputation out there. In fact, I can't think of a single decent one off the top of my head; the one that springs to mind foremost in relation to this film is the 2007 film Hit-man, which turned out to be very poor indeed. Max Payne isn't quite that bad, but it is a trite and predictable movie with a cookie-cutter plot and no real focus to the narrative.The story is about a grieving cop who lost his wife to some nefarious bad guys. He becomes involved in a plot involving an illicit drug that, surprise surprise, turns out to have some relation to his wife's death, and the film goes from there. But despite a fairly shot running time (1 hour 40 minutes to be precise), the plot is meandering and the action sequences are anything but exciting. They're supposed to feel dynamic, over the top, and are often depicted via slow motion, but they're also bland and sanitised in order to garner a PG-13 rating. It's like a dog biting you without any teeth.Wahlberg is okay as the hero, but he doesn't bring much to the part. He's no better or worse than an out-for-revenge Seagal in one of his early efforts. The supporting cast is notable for either being cast for their looks (Mila Kunis and Olga Kurylenko make good sisters, I admit) or half-recognisable past it types (Beau Bridges and Chris O'Donnell, what are you doing here?). The addition to the narrative of some dream-type sequences involving fiery demons is an unwelcome distraction to the otherwise grounded storyline and feels like an effort to add a bit of CONSTANTINE to an otherwise mundane film.",Max Payne
2,SnoopyStyle,"Wahlberg wooden, Kunis acting tough",4,10 December 2013,"NYPD detective Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) works diligently in cold cases where he investigates the murder of his wife and baby. He questions Natasha (Olga Kurylenko) crashing a party. When she turns up dead the next day, his former partner Alex investigates. He discovers some clues, but is killed. Max is jumped in Alex's house, and some suspect Max's involvement. And then Natasha's mysterious sister Mona Sax (Mila Kunis) comes looking for answers.Mark Wahlberg is wooden and has no charisma in this movie. Mila Kunis is out of place as a tough chick. It feels like make believe for the young Miss Kunis. The production value is best described as better than B-movies with pretensions of a great movie. The investigation grinds on and on. It's not very compelling. It's a fail attempt at a noir crime drama mainly due to the actors and the wonky script. There is a good amount of shooting action, but its style doesn't make it compelling. It feels more like people are throwing everything and anything at this. And there isn't enough excitement.",Max Payne
3,Prismark10,A pain to watch,3,15 August 2018,"Max Payne is a dull, derivative cheap looking adaptation of a video game.Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a NYPD detective investigating the death of his wife and baby.The film has a neo noir setting but Wahlberg is a blank, he just turned up for the pay cheque.It has almost a monochrome type washed out scenes, a bit like Sin City.The script is inane as Payne's investigation leads him to super soldiers addicted to an experimental drug and crooked cops. As this is a video game adaptation you have long drawn out John Woo inspired shooting sequences.",Max Payne
4,kosmasp,It's all about the game (and how you play/shoot it),3,26 April 2009,"If you are an avid fan of the game ""Max Payne"", let me tell you: This movie wasn't directed for you. But then again, it almost seems it wasn't directed for anyone! Yes some action scenes are fairly good. But with so many movies to choose from, why pick a movie, that has so-so action scenes, with a really bad story breakdown as shown here? Actually there is no reason! While the game was aimed and made for adults, the movie was really keen in trying to get a PG-13. And while it worked for ""The Dark Knight"", this movie can only suffer from this comparison. Some would argue that many movies would suffer from that comparison. But Max Payne does more so. It was a real pain to watch the movie, especially the messed up ending! I only know the theatrical version, but I'm pretty sure, that the extended cut, won't make much of a difference!",Max Payne
5,jboothmillard,Max Payne,4,26 February 2012,"I saw the leading actor interviewed and taking part, as well as mentioning this film on Top Gear, and it was only just before I started watching it that I found out it was based on a video game, so I was keen to see what I would make of it, from director John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines, The Omen). Basically NYPD detective Max Payne (Razzie nominated Mark Wahlberg) seeks revenge against the man who three years ago murdered his wife Michelle (Marianthi Evans) and baby, and in the meantime he works in the cold case division trying, continuing to try and find new evidence. Two people stick by the loner's side to offer him hope, ex-partner Alex Balder (Donal Logue) who may have found a clue, and security chief BB Hensley (Beau Bridges) who worked at the same pharmaceutical company as Max's wife. While this is going on, bodies are piling up all over the city, people are dying in mysterious and unexplained ways, and the result appear to be a highly addictive street drug that causes dangerous and in most cases fatal hallucinations to those who take it. Max is soon joined by Mona Sax (Mila Kunis), who originally wanted to arrest or kill him for apparently having something to do with her sister's death, but she agrees to help him in his search. They find out that this drug was to make people, specifically those trained for certain fields, to lose their weak senses, i.e. fear and guilt, and become much more willing and determined in certain situations, e.g. war. By the end of the film Max finally catches up to the man who admits to selling this drug Valkyr on the streets, and killing his wife, it turns out to be BB, and he gets what he deserved. Also starring Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges as Jim Bravura, Chris O'Donnell as Jason Colvin, Amaury Nolasco as Jack Lupino, Kate Burton as Nicole Horne, Quantum of Solace's Olga Kurylenko as Natasha and Nelly Furtado as Christa Balder. Whalberg I will admit is a bit too stony-faced in this face as his character is filled with unending grief and anger, and the supporting cast although good names don't really add much either, the story is a bit predictable, and the special effects for the hallucinations and action sequences are alright, overall it is a less than average but not terrible action crime drama. Okay!",Max Payne
6,Tweekums,Decent action thriller,6,28 November 2011,"Often films based on video games suffer from having the feel of watching somebody else play the game; a bit of a weakness as the whole point of a game is to play it yourself. Thankfully I never really got that feeling here; in fact if I hadn't known it was based on a game beforehand I probably wouldn't have suspected. The film follows the eponymous Detective Max Payne as he carries out his own unofficial investigation into his wife's unsolved murder. His investigation isn't helped by the fact that people he comes into contact with seem to wind up dead; including his former partner leading the police to suspect him! Initially it looks as if his wife was the victim of a robbery that went wrong but as the investigation proceeds it becomes apparent that she was targeted because of something she found out at the pharmaceutical company where she worked. As Max gets closer to solving the case things get more and more dangerous for him and the number of people he can trust gets lower and lower.While this wasn't a great film it wasn't terrible either; Mark Wahlberg was believable in the title role managing to pull off the unbelievable action in a believable way! The story was fairly cliché; a cop haunted by his wife's murder has been done many times before, that didn't mean it wasn't interesting. I quite liked the cold look of the film; in many places the colour was almost drained from the picture; I was less impressed with the CGI used to depict the hallucinations the users of a drug saw early on I wasn't certain if the were meant to be hallucinations or if the film contained some supernatural weirdness! I can't say how it compares to the original came but as a film it passes the time well enough and is worth catching if it is on television.",Max Payne
7,ma-cortes,"Thriller full of action , violence and lots of computer generator effects",6,24 January 2010,"Everything ripped apart in a New York minutes...Detective Max Payne(Mark Wahlberg) is a man with nothing to lose in the violent, cold urban night of New York. A fugitive undercover cop framed for murder and now hunted by cops and the mob. Max is a man with his back against the wall, fighting a battle he cannot hope to win. Prepare for pain.. But Max has nothing to lose. His wife and daughter have been murdered by narcotic addicts, a drug called Valkyr that induces hallucinations of flying demons . However things get worse, he has been accused for the killing of his best friend, a D.E.A. agent( Donald Logue). He's only helped by another agent (Mila Kunis) whose sister (Olga Kurylenko) has relationship to strange mobster (Amaury Norlasco) and his criminal activities.Blaming the Russian mafia, he seeks out the most gangster mob boss in the city, taking on an army of mobsters that he could not possibly hope to overcome, Max Payne confronts the epitome of crime, but aware that the mafia is only a pawn for a higher corruption, as he discovers the power-hungry , hush-hush pharmaceutical Corporation and whose security chief (Beau Bridges) is his mentor. In an attempt to clear his good name and settle his past, Max Payne serves as a vigilante to eliminate the origen of a new designer drug being trafficked and which turning ex-soldiers into killing machines, that of which he thinks was responsible for the murdering of his wife and daughter.This is a rumbling action movie based on video games by Sam Lake , one of the most important action games ever made for the P.C. Tough and two-fisted Mark Wahlberg as detective who sets out to uncover the truths behind his family's killing , his role as revenger driven by determination to avenge , acting as judge, jury and executioner is similarly to ¨Death Wish-Charles Bronson¨ and recently ¨the Punisher-Thomas Jane¨. Large secondary cast as Chris O'Donnell, Beau Bridges,Kate Burton and the Bond-girl Olga Kurylenko. And a brief interpretation as widow by the famous singer Nelly Furtado. Colorful and dark cinematography with glistering camera-work by Jonathan Sela capturing the rain and snow that falls on N.Y. buildings and streets . Stirring musical score fitting to noisy action by Marco Beltrani. This Neo-noir vendetta picture is middling directed by John Moore . He is an expert on remakes (The Omen, Flight of the Phoenix) and warlike action (Behind enemy lines). Rating : Acceptable and passable. The flick will appeal to Mark Wahlberg fans.",Max Payne
8,michaelRokeefe,Revenge can bite like Hell.,5,8 February 2009,"Forget about the game and cheer Mark Wahlberg for getting through this terse blunt force drama of revenge. Wahlberg plays Max Payne, an undercover New York City DEA agent, that takes on duty in the Cold Case basement searching for any clue that might lead to who is responsible for the death of his wife and young son. He will team up with a beautiful female assassin Mona Sax(Mia Kunis)and enter an avenging and ultra-obsessive investigation that will take them to the city's underbelly and a collision with fantasy and the darkest of reality.John Moore directs this explosive and hard-hitting crime drama. Also in the cast: Beau Bridges, Donal Logue, hip-hop artist Ludicrous, Olga Kurylenko and Chris O'Donnell.",Max Payne
9,jotix100,A pain in the you-know-where,5,27 November 2009,"Max Payne is a detective suffering from a tragedy. His wife and baby son were killed in a tragic way. Now he is going around trying to find out who the assassin was. For that, he is willing to go wherever to get the guy responsible. Since the death, Max has been assigned to the cold case unit, where he follows leads that obviously don't go anywhere. Little does Max know that forces bigger than he can even think are working against him. Even his father's old partner, BB, who appears to protect him, knows a lot more and has a special interest in his young protégé.In the meantime, Max has to fight all the strange forces that want him dead. The clue appears to be in the company where his wife Michelle used to work. The pharmaceutical company has created such a potent drug that was designed to give the troops fighting terrorism an edge over the enemy. What's more, the super powers they get make them soar and attack viciously the people they want to eliminate. Max proves he is up to the task while almost losing his mind in the process.This film is based on a video game and it shows. Beau Thorne's screenplay plays like a fantasy one encounters on an arcade or on a computer game. John Moore, the director, has proved he knows how to get the viewer involved, but in this case the story is his own worst enemy because the hero just doesn't hold the viewer's attention. In order to compensate for the lack of originality, he goes for a lot of action with the special effects that at times are so amazingly silly, one can almost laugh at some of the most intense parts.Mark Wahlberg has done better and deserve material where he can create a character. His Max Payne is not exactly one of his better screen roles because it's just plain phony from the start. Beau Bridges fares better with his BB, the head of security of the pharmaceutical firm. Mila Kunis' Mona is an enigma. Ludicrous has nothing to play.Dan Zimmerman must be given credit for his editing of this messy film. Jonathan Sela, the cinematographer, photographs Toronto in the constant snow trying to make it pass for Manhattan.",Max Payne
10,Scarecrow-88,Max Payne,5,20 May 2010,"Cold case cop, Max Payne(Mark Wahlberg), once a homicide detective, is out to find the ones responsible for the murders of his wife and child. What he discovers is that the company his wife Michelle worked for, Aeser, produced a drug, supposed the make soldiers in the war against terror, stronger and fearless. This drug, named Valkyre(it gives you wings), causes a harmful effect in that it creates hallucinations of demons with wings swooping around as buildings and high-rises burn in the distance..it certainly makes for a stunning image, the director plays to the hilt, especially at the end after Max must take the blue ""V"" in order to rise up, after diving into a frozen river(used to bury the dead at the bottom whose voices were silenced for one reason or another)to avoid being gunned down in cold blood by someone he thought was his closest ally. This movie is beautifully shot, it looks great, the art direction, camera work, the way gunfire creates destruction in slow motion, and how snow falls in just exactly the most striking fashion the filmmakers can possibly muster. I especially loved how, when people were shot, you could see blood in the cloud of smoke as ammunition rings and bodies fall. But, the storyline takes quite a while to develop and is rather uninspired. I mean, anyone who has seen a gazillion action movies knows that Max' best, most loyal and trusting friend is the one behind everything that transpires..it's all too obvious, and he's pretty much suspect the moment he appears. Mila Kunis is Mona Sax, a Russian mafia girl whose sister was butchered, eventually joins forces with Wahlberg's Max Payne, himself a vigilante of the grand tradition. Payne ""breaks down doors"" at night in pursuit of the one who got away after killing his family. Payne is a dour man on mission, who simply exists because of the injustice yet concluded. Beau Bridges is BB, a company man who was Michelle's boss. Ludicrous is Lt Jim Bravura, a detective investigating Payne and the other homicides on the rise on the NYC streets, the tattoo of bird wings on the arms of the victims left torn to pieces. Chris O'Donnell and Donal Logue are wasted in nothing parts as a Aeser company employee and Payne's former partner, respectively. Both are in and out in short order, only contributing to the body count when they know too much and must pay the consequences. Amaury Nolasco is Lupino, a Spanish soldier who now has a group of men on the street peddling their blue ""V"" to junkies, before dispatching anyone they believe is due to become ""angels"". Olga Kurylenko makes an impression, albeit in a minor part as a future victim who encounters Max briefly and knew something about the drug and Lupino, as the Russian sister of Mona, who is a party girl and junkie. Marianthi Evans is Max' dead wife, Michelle. I can't imagine fans of the Max Payne game would really like this movie, to be honest, because it really doesn't feature a whole lot of on screen blood shed, just instances where we see bodies flying out of frame after being pulverized by Max' shot gun blasts. And, as I mentioned above, the story takes it's time developing, and even after the stage is set, the plot is nothing we haven't seen in a limitless amount of other action movies. I think the look of the film is it's major asset, because everything else is unimaginative. Wahlberg is going through the motions here. Kunis looks great, to me, as a hitwoman, but it should be in a Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez joint, where she has a part with meat on it's bones.",Max Payne
11,CinemaSerf,A cold case that hots up...,6,12 October 2021,"I quite enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's efforts here as a NYC detective who must ally with the rather dubious - and deadly - Mila Kunis (""Mona Sax"") to unravel a mystery that has left bodies (including those of his wife and daughter) all over the city. The closer they get to the truth, the more they realise that just about everyone else in the place is now on their tail - and it's getting dangerous, with the pair uncertain as to whom they can trust. It's a quickly paced, if pretty derivative, action adventure with the usual mix of vengeance and kick-ass action married with an underlying domination theme - this time, a hallucinogenic drug - that must be addressed by our pair of increasingly isolated investigators. The visual effects are effective, the score works hard to build and sustain the tension but as ever, the writing was the first thing under the bus. The dialogue is banal, there is a fair degree of stereotyping and in the end it is really just an high-octane adaptation of a shoot 'em up video game that just about does what it says on the tin. Not great, not rubbish - but entertaining enough for fans of mindless fantasy crime capers.",Max Payne
12,poolandrews,Average at best video game adaptation.,4,10 December 2011,"Max Payne is set in New York where police detective Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) works in the 'cold case' unit, three years previously he arrived home to find his wife Michelle & baby murdered & has been on a personal crusade to find out the reason why & who was behind it. Max spends his spare time chasing leads & while at a party to question his informant meets a woman called Natasha (Olga Kurylenko) whom he takes back to his apartment, the next morning & Natasha is found dead & Max becomes the number one suspect. Max's old partner Alex (Donal Logue) investigates the case & finds a connection between Natasha's murder & the murder of Max's family but he too is found murdered inside Max's apartment before he can tell anyone. Max is convinced that he is close to finding the answers he has been looking for, a sinister plan involving identical tattoos, a blue drug, betrayal & a military experiment is responsible & Max is determined to dish out some justice...This Canadian & American co-production was co-produced & directed by John Moore & is based on the first person shooter video game Max Payne released back in 2001, generally disliked by fans of the video game & fans of good films Max Payne can only be considered a disappointment. Right away I will admit that I have never played the Max Payne video game so cannot say how faithful this adaptation is although I have seen lots of films so feel more than qualified to say that I didn't think Max Payne was a particularly good film at all. I was expecting something better, something more imaginative & something more fantasy based than what we ended up with, to be honest Max Payne is a dull police mystery drama for the majority of it's duration with only the winged demons providing any sort of fantasy element at all & even those are revealed to be nothing more than drug users hallucinations. The detective mystery aspect is poor with no effort to create any sort of convincing mystery & furthermore no effort at any twists, turns or surprises. Max never seems to have to work anything out or solve anything, virtually the entire plot is given away when Mona visits some black gangster & he seems to know everything & just tells her everything while Max gets everything he needs to know by hitting a guy in the nose a few times. The facts are just given up too easily, none of the character's have to work for them & there's no sense of discovery as the script just plods along. At 100 odd minutes Max Payne has a few forgettable shoot outs but is surprisingly lacking in action, a promising opening with Payne submerged in a potentially watery grave is totally wasted as he merely just swims to the surface a little later & it's never really explained how Natasha became involved with the drug or how it worked or what the ultimate goal of the people involved in this sinister military plot was. If you do end up watching Max Payne stick around once the end credits start as there's another little scene after them which destroys the ambiguous climax & reminds you that Mona totally disappeared for the last twenty minutes.Generally speaking video games do not make for great films & while Max Payne isn't the worst video game adaptation or even the worst thriller around it's further proof that the two mediums are very different & appeal to people for different reasons. Apparently the Max Payne game had something called bullet-time which is included here, or as anyone familiar with films like to call it slow-motion. The best aspect of Max Payne are it's slick visuals, a really stylish mix of graphic novel & film-noir thriller Max Payne looks great, it's just a pity as much effort didn't go into the script. Having said that max Payne is stylish without really ever having it's own style, the near black & white cinematography with hints of colour reminded me of Sin City (2005) while the constant rain & snow felt like Se7en (1995) & the slow-motion bullet-time looks like it's from The Matrix (1999). The action scenes are forgettable & it's an hour into the film before the first one even kicks in, the CGI computer effects are good though. Being a Hollywood studio production Max Payne is tame with no real blood or gore & minimal violence.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 this had a fair amount of money spent on it, apparently the original Max Payne game designers weren't impressed with the finished film & lets face it, they weren't the only ones. Filmed mainly in Toronto in Canada. The acting is pretty poor at times, Mark Wahlberg is alright while rapper Ludicrous has a small role, Beau Bridges & Chris O'Donnell also turn up.Max Payne is an average thriller with only some very nice visuals to recommend it, the story is a mess & the lack of any decent action or violence is a real killer. I just can't say I thought it was very good & everyone else I have spoken to who has seen it feels the same way.",Max Payne
13,dbborroughs,Muddled plot diminishes great action and a wonderful visual sense to make an okay film,6,21 October 2008,"Working the cold case desk, Max is looking for clues that might help him solve the murder of his wife and child. When his after hours snooping gets him linked to the murder of a girl he met at a party, Payne finds himself hip deep in trouble and hot hot on the trail of the killer of his family.A very muddled plot line (I'm still not sure what happened) distracts from some great action sequences and a visual style that is really neat.The film is not only juggling too many plot threads, its doing so in a way that knots them up into a nattered mess. I'm not sure if the problem is that the story never really made sense or if its just because they cut the hell out of it to get a PG13. What ever the cause what could have been a great little film is just an okay one. I'm especially in love with the winged Valkyrie that haunt the film. Nominally a hallucination, the result of a super-soldier drug gone wrong, they take on a deeper significance as the film goes on of the righteous warrior (Payne) going into battle.Not a horrible film by any means, but certainly not anything that you'll want to pay any great amount of money to see. My advice is wait for cable or at the least the DVD when you can rent it.",Max Payne
14,zardoz-13,"Loads of Payne, But Little Gain!",4,24 October 2008,"""Flight of the Phoenix"" director John Moore and rookie writer Beau Thorne have turned the popular third-person shooter video game ""Max Payne"" into a big, dumb, loud, bullet-riddled actioneer with former Calvin Klein underwear model Mark Wahlberg as the vengeance-driven anti-hero. This shallow but supercharged saga about a relentless New York City Police detective searching for the felons that murdered his wife and infant child qualifies as a straightforward, formulaic crime thriller. Despite its painfully predictable plot, ""Max Payne"" boasts top-notch digital visual effects, an eardrum-splitting soundtrack, and atmospheric, film-noir cinematography.Since the mysterious murders of his wife and child three years ago, former homicide detective Max Payne has confined himself to the nether regions of the New York City Police Department's cold case unit. Max scowls in his black-leather jacket and dark slacks as he peruses old reports. He walks around loaded down with an arsenal of guns. Max believes he has found a new lead in his wife's murder, but it turned out to be a dead end. Later, he crashes a party thrown by a former snitch. Our hero hooks up with a drop-dead gorgeous Russian honey, Natasha (Ukrainian-born actress Olga Kurylenko of ""Hitman""), and they head off for his apartment. Max refuses to sleep with Natasha, so she storms out in anger. She steals Max's wallet, too. Manhattan's desolate, snowy streets aren't a safe place for feisty Natasha. Gigantic winged demons descend upon her. When the NYPD find her remains the following day, they have to scoop up the pieces.Initially, circumstantial evidence implicates Max for Natasha's death. Ex-partner Alex Balder (Donal Logue of ""Blade"") grilles him about Natasha without luck. Bad vibes alienate Alex and his ex-partner over the unsolved murders of Michelle Payne and their baby. During his investigation of Natasha's murder, Balder spots similarities between Michelle's dead killers and Natasha. At this point, Natasha's gun-toting sister Mona Sax (Mila Kunis of ""The Bionic Woman"") who works for the Russian mafia enters the picture. Mona wants a piece of Max whose own fortunes tumble further when he discovers Alex's corpse in his apartment. Alex had found a link between a winged Valkyrie tattoo on Nastasha's severed limb and those of the killers that Max gunned down when he came home that fateful day three years ago. Nevertheless, the chief culprit in Michelle's death has managed to elude Max. Now, our hero must clear himself not only of Natasha's murder but also Alex's death.Max's wife Michelle (Marianthi Evans of ""Thirteen"") had planned to blow the whistle on Aesir, a giant pharmaceutical firm where she worked, that had experimented with a powerful hallucinogen called Valkyr to turn U.S. troops into fearless fighters in the war on terror. Predictably, Aesir's experiments backfired. Soldiers either died or mutated into subhuman winged predators resembling gargoyles. Just when everything appears to be heading south for our hero, his old police buddy BB Hensley (Beau Bridges of ""Stargate Continuum"") comes to his rescue like the U.S. cavalry. Now, BB works as Aesir's chief of security. While BB has Max's back, our hero also has to contend with Internal Affairs investigator Jim Bravura (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"") who is not sure who to believe.In Remedy Entertainment's 2001 video game, Max was a DEA agent, not a New York cop. The Italian Mafia was Max's enemy. Moore's melancholy action melodrama replaces the Mafia with Aesir. Moore retains the Valkyr plot, but Mona doesn't die in the showdown at Aesir. The video game was first to use the ultra-slow motion 'bullet time' effect that Andy and Larry Wachowski popularized in ""The Matrix"" trilogy. Further, the video game aped Asian director John Woo's flamboyant Hong Kong action epics. However, Moore prefers unvarnished violence instead of John Woo's balletic bloodletting shoot-outs. Imagine a stone-cold Charles Bronson revenge opera with the drug plot from the Sean Connery sci-fi thriller ""Outland,"" and you'll have an idea about what to expect.""Max Payne"" amounts to a polished potboiler, with few surprises that strike you like a bolt from the blue. Thorne's screenplay relies primarily on clichés. You'll know before Max does who killed Michelle and their newborn. Moreover, you'll spot the chief villain before he confesses. Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges, Chris O'Donnell, and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges co-star with Wahlberg. Wahlberg delivers a toned down performance as Max. Basically, Wahlberg sports one expression. He never laughs. He is all business. Mila Kunis looks like she could vanquish Laura Croft. Beau Bridges excels as chummy Max's friend. Poor Chris O'Donnell gets lost in the mix.""Max Payne"" bristles with action during its 100 minute running time. The shoot-outs are loud but antiseptic. Occasionally, a combatant will exhaust their supply of ammo. Thousands of ejected shell casings chime against concrete during the gunfights. John Moore, who also helmed ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and ""The Omen"" remake, loves to show guys and gals loading their firearms, blasting away with them, and then reloading. Moore captures the hyperactive state of the Valkyr-drugged soldiers. The scenes where Valkyries hover over those who have consumed Valkyr are mildly spooky. Only once does ""Max Payne"" give us a glimpse of these winged hellions. The filmmakers never reveal if the Valkyries are either apparitions or the actual thing. Moore and Thorne relate two-thirds of the story in flashback. After the opening predicament, the scene shifts to 'one week earlier.' When the present finally catches up with the past, our hero has a date with the villain on a helipad atop a skyscraper as storm cloud gather. ""Max Payne"" doesn't deviate from the B-movie action formula. This derivative, one-dimensional thriller ranks as a solid but unexceptional thriller.",Max Payne
15,grantss,Better than expected,6,9 March 2020,"Surprisingly good. I was expecting a mindless shoot-em-up but the plot was actually quite decent.Best thing about it was the dark setting and the CGI - reminded me a lot of Sin City, which is a very big compliment.Decent acting by Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis.",Max Payne
16,Boba_Fett1138,"Wrong story, for the wrong movie.",5,14 June 2011,"Talking about wasted potential. The video games featuring Max Payne are not just popular because of they are action filled games but perhaps more so because they play like a modern film-noir, with its atmosphere, story and characters. All of those elements got suddenly for some reason totally changed or abandoned and what is left is some confusingly bad written movie, with some average action in it.I don't get it why movies based on video games often feel the need to feature a new and original story, that deviates from the video games. Seriously, the story from the first two Max Payne games would had been compelling and great to see on the silver screen. The story that we have instead now for this movie feels like it got written for a totally different movie at first. On top of that, it just isn't a very solid or original story to begin with. It doesn't make the movie a very compelling watch, also because it can get confusingly bad at times.I still really liked the dark visual style of the movie though, that also was really in style and tone with the video games. But however this also forms a problem at the same time. The visual style makes this movie seem like a film-noir, while it's story, although it tries hard, just isn't noir. It's lacking all of the required ingredients and also the characters are not well written enough for that.It's also a poorly and just wrongly cast movie. I'm not a Mark Wahlberg hater but he just wasn't right for this role at all. He's not tough looking enough for that and also doesn't have the right acting skills to convincingly sent out all of the emotions and complexity of the Payne character. Same goes for Mila Kunis as Mona Sax really. And remind me, why was she in this movie again? Her character actually doesn't add anything at all and might as well been left out entirely. But Kunis also just isn't right for the role. Mona Sax is supposed to be the definition of a femme fatale. A girl you can easily fall in love with but always need to be careful that she won't be putting a knife in your back. Kunis however is far too soft and friendly looking for that. No way it's believable that she is a girl that can kill without remorse and in the blink of an eye, though she can most likely still beat me in a fight.Guess good thing you can say about this movie is that it's not a boring one to watch. There is always something happening and luckily there also is plenty of action. You however most likely won't ever be very taken by any of it, simply because you won't care about the story or characters enough for that.But like most other people I'm still hopeful for a reboot. All of the potential and material to make a great movie series is there up for the grabs, hopefully to be picked up by a more capable writer and more suitable cast next time. 5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Max Payne
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"For some, this will have a bunch going for it",5,5 November 2008,"I've played both VG's, several times through, and I enjoy them. I don't think many are going to argue that this has a lot of atmosphere, almost every moment of it, and builds mood, often rather well. There are a couple of real nice visuals in this, and the overall look and feel is achieved almost invariably successfully. That's, unfortunately, most of the positive. Before I get into the negative, let me tell you, if you dig the original, 2001 game, you are in for a treat here, the references, the things they got right, they *really* hit the nail on the head with. Obviously that isn't going to count for anything to those not going in with such in mind, so I'll also say that select pieces of the action, especially near the end, were very cool. There isn't much of it, though, in this, which really stands in stark contrast to its source, which has received comments about having too little varying play, in that it was almost entirely based on shooting(and the moves). I'm afraid that's brought me to the bad... this is merely the sum of its elements. Overuse of effects occurs... the first time we see a flickering light, it's good, but it gets excessive, if not that strongly. It also seems very intent on both telling us that it has a high production value(which it does, no doubt), and I'm not sure all the suggestive material was there for any other reason than attracting young people, and one can question whether it should really be in something like this. On that, Kunis is too young for the part, and she does *not* have the femme fatale thing going on. Wahlberg is closer in age to his role, and he does brooding reasonably well. But let me get back to where I was just headed... does this fit in the genre that what it comes from does? Max Payne, both when we saw him in '01 and when we rejoined him in '03, was a mix of film noir, John Woo movies and a dash of The Matrix. That can't really be said about this. Bullet-time is featured, but only barely at all, and seldom that impressive. The tone is dark, bordering on drab once or twice, and at least one downright tasteless sequence, that I'm also not sure was meant to have the overtones it wound up with. There are a handful of attempts(that I imagine few will laugh at) at comedy, but no actual humor. Not all of it is thought through, and characters get exposition-happy some. The acting tends to be average or better. This isn't without dramatic moments, and actually has a different and interesting take on certain aspects of the story, which they actually translated relatively well to the silver screen. The CGI is quite excellent. The style is noteworthy, if limited(perhaps intentionally so). And anyone who thinks Nolasco can only ever be the sympathetic Sucre, well, just hold off on judging that until you see this. Sound has something to bring to the table, and music, as well. Pacing may not be flawless, but I can't claim that I was ever bored watching this. The cinematography and editing have stuff to offer, if not devoid of odd choices. You can tell this was PG-13, at times. The language isn't pervasive, and harsher is found elsewhere. I recommend this to fans of the interactive efforts involving of the same title, and those intrigued... albeit I would advise that you keep an open mind, the former group to a greater extent than the latter(who, honestly, will probably get less out of this). 5/10",Max Payne

19,neil-476,"All a bit ""So what?""",7,21 April 2013,"I was looking forward to this movie. The trailer was intriguing, with some great visuals - large flappy bird man pulling someone out of a window, slow-mo shoot-ups, dark noir-ish feel. I'm not a video game player, so I was unaware until fairly recently that it was a video game adaptation, and that wouldn't necessarily put me off anyway.So off I went. And I was disappointed.It's the old, old story - all the best stuff is in the trailer. And once again it turns out that the straightforward linear narrative, so typical of videogames and their adaptations, translates into a muddled and confusing storyline in the film.Max Payne is a detective working cold cases following the murder of his wife and child. Following some coincidences, it turns out that their deaths are related to a cold case, and it's all to do with a conspiracy concerning a super-soldier serum. Ho-hum. The story is OK, I suppose, but no better than OK.The movie does look quite good. The bleached colours are getting a bit old these days, but there's some variation , and it does suit the subject matter. The effects are quite nice although a) there's one point where the same shot of winged thingies is used twice and b) the science fiction ambiance put over so strongly in the trailer is quite misleading - this is essentially a crime drama, with minor sci-fi trimmings.The cast are no more than adequate. We already knew that Wahlberg could do worry (a frown), anger (a frown), puzzlement (a frown) and sadness (a frown). For Max Payne he has added a kind of bizarre grimace which is intended to convey happiness. It's scary.The winged thingies - the best thing in the movie - turn out to be hallucinations brought on by the super-soldier serum. What a disappointment. And a wasted opportunity.",Max Payne
20,anaconda-40658,Max Pained.,5,16 December 2015,"Max Payne (2008): Dir: John Moore / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges, Chris O'Donnell, Nelly Furtado: Noir styled action film based on a video game. Max Payne investigates murders related to that of his wife involving drugs and paranoia. Directed by John Moore with exquisite tinted color and black and white. Moore previously directed the remake of The Omen as well as the pitiful Behind Enemy Lines. Here he further displays his talent for action while really only contributing to the empty sub genre of video game films. Screenplay is creative although the concept is hardly genius and is hopeless with a conclusion that leaves more hopelessness. Mark Wahlberg plays off the bitter hardness of Payne whose happiness died with his wife. Mila Kunis plays the sister of a victim who has her own resources to assisting Payne. While the leads fare fine, the supporting roles are a hindrance. Beau Bridges and Chris O'Donnell are given underwritten roles, which is unfortunate given the fact that neither have made much impact in film within the previous few years prior to this. Musician Nelly Furtado also makes an appearance although whether she matches her music with her acting, is one's opinion. The highlight here is the noir tinted color that gives the film a detective feel otherwise it is populated with video game violence with tremendous visuals that underline the hopelessness.

21,FlashCallahan,The angels are not done with you yet.....,5,13 March 2010,"Three years ago, NYPD detective Max Payne's wife and baby were murdered. Max gets himself transferred to the cold case office where he can continue searching for the killer who got away.He's a loner, but two people reach out to him during a fateful week: Alex, his ex-partner who may have found a clue, and BB, the security chief at the pharmaceutical company where Max's wife worked.Meanwhile, bodies are piling up, some as a result of a drug on the street that is highly addictive and, for many who take it, brings hideous hallucinations.When one of the bodies is a woman Payne was the last to see alive, her sister comes looking for him armed to the teeth; Max must move fast...based on the game that had film noir written all over it, Payne does have film noir elements to it, but the visuals heavily rely on films such as 'Sin City' to keep the audience interested.Wahlberg is probably the best choice ever to play Payne, as he only really has one expression, disdain, and he spends the majority of the film shouting unconvincingly at one time stars (hi, Chris O'Donnell) and shooting his gun in stylish ways John Woo would be ashamed of.The doesn't know whether it wants to be a noir like thriller, or Goth horror, and it really confuses itself at several points during the movie.If you haven't played the video game, no worries, this has barely anything to do with it, apart from the initial story and some of the set pieces, all the rest is Payne maundering through his life and trying to find out why his wife died.The last fifteen minutes are okay, but not good enough to make up for the previous seventy.It's pretty to look at, and suitably moody in places, but becomes very dull after a while, which films like this shouldn't be.",Max Payne
22,Aaron1375,Its bad when the story of the video game outshines that of the movie version.,4,28 October 2008,"Yes, this movie was a bit of a letdown for me. I was expecting a really bang bang shoot em up type movie. I did not really get that here. I should have known it was not going to be good when it was rated pg-13 instead of R. I mean the game was rated M yet the movie garners a lower rating, why? I mean do the 13 through 16 year old boys really have that much impact on how much a movie makes that you tick off those of us who like a lot of blood and cussing in our action movie? Really, there are a heck of a lot more of us over the age of 16 that our money should be more of a concern. Enough of that though, the movie to me was a bit boring. Max Payne might have been portrayed right by Mark Walhberg, but they seem to have taken away Payne's sense of humor in this movie. I mean the dude in the video game lost his family to, but there was still a sense of humor in some of his inner monologues. The movie also took a lot of the better plot points of the game out and substituted them with plot points that were not very good at all. Along with this the whole angel/demon thing was a bit much and one of those things they added that if left out could have saved the movie money, money that could have been added to more shoot outs and such. So the story, Payne lost his wife and kids and now he is searching for the killer and is joined somewhat by an assassin girl who loses a sister during the course of the movie. A rather underdeveloped assassin girl who all but disappears at the end of the movie after she shoots one guy up. That is about all there is to it, it is obvious they are aiming for a sequel, but I prefer my movie to end with less loose ends to tie up than this one did. Still, there is a couple of nice shoot outs, and the visuals in the movie are rather nice, I just wish they had movie shots fired. Why do comic book movies and video games movies seem to have such short action sequences? There are exceptions to this, but it seems makers of these types of films just feel they have to delve into the characters a bit more than necessary. Look at one of the exceptions ""The Dark Knight"", in that one you had a very nice long action sequence with the big car chase scene and that movie did rather well. So basically other than the two shoot outs and nice visuals this movie falls way short of the video game in terms of entertainment value.",Max Payne
23,zetes,"Not bad for a video game adaptation, but not good for a movie",5,22 March 2009,"About the best that can be said of this movie is that it's hardly the worst film that's ever been made out of a video game. Then again, it pretty much throws the game to the wind anyway. Max Payne was one of the first games of the Playstation 2 system, and, well, it would be giving it too much credit to say that it revolutionized storytelling within a video game. It at least tried to be cinematic in a way that no game up to that point (2001) had tried to be. It was pretty much a video game noir, complete with its own hardboiled dialogue. The film would have been wise to keep that aspect of the game. It might then have been fun. As it is now, it's a dismal, depressing revenge drama. Mark Wahlberg plays the titular ex-cop who is seeking clues to his wife and child's murder. His investigations lead him to a corporation that has developed a new drug, Valkyr, which gives humans almost god-like power (in the game I remember it caused you to go into Matrix-style bullet-time physics). I guess it's not half bad as a revenge drama, but I always find myself wishing that that didn't even exist as a genre. According to Homer Simpson, revenge fantasies are one of the most common gifts Hollywood gives us. The look of the film is quite excellent, and it looks especially great on Blu Ray. Mila Kunis is sexy as a woman Wahlberg hooks up with, and who is also out for revenge. Recent Bond girl Olga Kurlyenko also appears (in at least her second video game adaptation, following Hit-man)  most Bond girls quickly disappear into the Playboys of history, but I really like this chick. Mostly sexually, but she's not a bad actress. I kind of hope she sticks around for a while.",Max Payne
24,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Max Payne,6,16 October 2008,"For starters, don't be a dweeb and start heading out the door when the end credits roll. If you deem that the movie didn't have proper closure since there are additional folks who didn't get their due Payne justice, then this scene at the end with Mila Kunis playing the Devil's Advocate, will probably make some amends to what is essentially a relatively generic detective drama.My first experience with the Max Payne game was by chance in a cybercafe. Back then, Counter-strike was all the rage, but having been thrown out of a server, I was poking around the computer's desktop, and noticed the game icon. My first impression after surviving all five minutes of it in the subway shootout, was that it allowed anyone who wanted to be Chow Yun-fat in a John Woo movie, play out their fantasy in full slow-motion glory. It was one that spewed plenty of blood, but more gratifying to a gamer, was how varied and massive the firepower was.How did the movie fare? Well for those looking for the same all-out wall to wall action, you might have to be patient until the hour mark before things really start to heat up. Even then, it takes a lot more set action pieces before you get to the money shots as seen in the trailer. Good thing though that director John Moore didn't go overboard with all the slow motion madness the trailers would have led you to believe. Then again, this made the action stick to the formula of body counts, unlimited rounds, and an almost indestructible hero.Those who are worried that Max Payne will be turned into John Constantine, can put their fears to rest. In fact, most of those winged angels don't serve much purpose in the movie, except to give the visual effects and the computer graphics guys a job to do. It's actually quite unnecessary except to throw up red herrings when you try and figure out what function they serve, and then it will dawn on you that it's for stylistic purposes and not substance.The opening of Max Payne made it look like it plagiarized that from Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity. And in fact, given the look and scowl on Damon in The Bourne Ultimatum's poster, he does look like a doppelganger of Mark Wahlberg, and both of them could probably interchange roles since all that is required, is a permanent scowl. As the character goes, Payne is out kicking down doors looking for the murderer of his wife and child. And this is essentially a one-man show easily dispatching countless of faceless, emotionless and pretty cliché (think The Fugitive type) villains. What I thought could have been frowned upon, especially when the morally right go up in arms to condemn the movie for its violence, would be what seemed like a condonment of drug use, never mind if it was used for survival purposes, because it made it seem like drugs make you tough and fearless.Supporting female characters get turned into your classic flower vases, and I seriously think that newly minted Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko should start to look for more variety in the roles that she plays, rather than the usual vampish Russian who doesn't hesitate in shedding her clothes for the screen and wanting to bed the hero. While she's largely forgettable here, Mila Kunis' role as Mona Sax would likely be the meatier one, but alas I suspect that most of her scenes got cut and left at the floor of the editing room. It's quite amazing though how a little goth makeup and loads of leather could transform her from friendly hotel front desk staff in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, to a character that has a penchant of popping up with no rhyme or reason.It's far from being a satisfactory game-turned-movie, mostly let down by the wafer thin plot that reeks of having been there and done that. Visually it's very beautiful to look at, with the constant gloomy nights punctuated with first snow. Fans of Wahlberg who are familiar with his bad-ass dude roles, would find that it's the same all over again, no matter if he's called Max Payne, Bob Lee Swagger, Dignam or Bobby Mercer.",Max Payne
25,siderite,"Shoot me, Max, I liked the movie! Sort of...",7,27 February 2009,"I had very low expectation for the movie and I have played the game so long ago that I don't remember anything else than moving through scores of Mafia guys guns blazing. I actually had to read the Wikipedia page to try to remember the game plot, but what is written there is hardly similar with what I remember. Well, my memory was never very good.So, assuming I knew almost nothing of the game, I liked the movie. It's a combination of Punisher and Constantine, with a huge cast of celebrities, even if none of them really have a great role. The atmosphere was just dark enough to like, some scenes and dialogues made no sense, but I quickly dismissed them with ""hey, it's Max Payne, a movie made from a video game!"" so I was able to have enough fun watching it. Even my wife actually watched it to the end, even if she mischievously commented on the scenes that made no sense.And yeah, I like Mark Wahlberg and I _really_ like Mila Kunis :).

26,Smells_Like_Cheese,Every cliché you can imagine in an action movie... yet somehow no blood and less swears,4,12 November 2008,"Well I do know that Max Payne is a video game, I've never played it, sorry to say, I've never even heard of it until the movie. But from what I hear, it's a very violent video game, so I was expecting an all out action packed movie. Now I had heard very bad things about the movie, but I was still curious to see what it was about, plus I love both Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis. While I started to watch it, the beginning was actually decent, I was thinking ""why all the bad reviews? this isn't so bad"" but then as it moved on, I can see why. First off, now I'm not trying to sound like this blood thirsty fan, but there are people getting shot left and right... but there is absolutely no blood, like they get shot and there's no blood? Not to mention, Mila Kunis's character just disappears at the end... maybe she felt it was so bad she just walked off, lol. The story stopped making sense, Mark Wahlberg kept the same face the whole time as well as the story stopped making sense.Max Payne has had a hard life, he had a beautiful child and wife who were just taken away from him, they were both brutally murdered and his life feels empty now. He is trying to find out who or what killed them, so he investigates to find out that anyone who has a certain tattoo is affiliated with a cult is mysteriously being killed off. He meets a woman who he wants information from, she has the same tattoo, but she is killed, now her sister, Mona Sax is looking to see what killed her, so she investigates with Max who finds out that he can't trust just anyone.Max Payne is just an alright film, pretty much it's forgettable. It could have had so much potential to be a great action film. I did enjoy the atmosphere though, I felt that it was a great feel to the film, it had a very film noir feel. Just the story fell short and the script was a little silly with some of the over the top trying to be like Terminator lines. Mark seemed like a great choice for an action hero, but he looks constipated throughout the film, lol. I think Jason Statham would have been a better choice maybe, but it's the script that needs work. Sorry to the video game fans, I know this was the ultimate let down for them, hopefully if they do a sequel they'll get it right next time.4/10",Max Payne
27,KineticSeoul,When bullet time is useless,3,13 April 2010,"Just play the video games of this title, because it's actually quite obvious the director just wanted to cash in by just putting a video game title on this. The video game has bullet time where everything slows down, but in this it felt out of place and felt like there was bullet time because the video game has bullet time. There was no need for bullet time and the gunfights are not done well at all. This is a boring action movie plain and simple, the special effects has demons and angels flying around which seems like it should of been in another ""Constantine"" movie. Maybe it would have been better if another director with more potential made it.3.2/10",Max Payne
28,Buddy-51,a great look in the service of weak material,4,21 February 2009,"Based on a popular video game of the same name, ""Max Payne"" is a film noir crime drama with a supernatural twist. Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a cold-case detective with the NYPD who's understandably obsessed with bringing the culprits who murdered his wife and kid to justice. When Max himself becomes a prime suspect in a series of subsequent killings, he sets off on a dual-purpose crusade: first, to find the actual killer and, second, to clear his own name of all charges. The sole original element in this otherwise thoroughly hackneyed setup comes in the form of a mysterious mythological bird (surprisingly NOT a maltese falcon) that seems to be the connecting thread tying all the murders together.Thanks to imaginative art direction, cinematography and production design, the movie does achieve an impressive and distinctive art deco look - i.e., denuded colors in an abundance of darkly-lit night scenes with snow flakes fluttering unceasingly through the picture. But, on the story level, the movie feels way too derivative of previous detective dramas to generate much interest of its own. The plot basically boils down to a bunch of law enforcement and criminal types strutting around in black leather jackets trying to look more bad-ass than the next fella'. As to the identity of the actual killer, look no further that the most likely of the ""least likely"" of the movie's suspects and you'll hit on him right off the bat. You'll also marvel at what incredibly bad shots everybody except Payne seems to be in the movie - with our hero emerging virtually unscathed from one fusillade after another, while he apparently has no trouble mowing down everybody else in sight with a single trusty pistol.Chalk ""Max Payne"" up to yet another sinecure in the increasingly frustrating career of Mr. Wahlberg.",Max Payne
29,Robert_duder,A different spin on the video game genre...a decent start,7,25 November 2008,"Max Payne won't blow you away, it won't be your favorite movie, and it wasn't even a fantastic action movie but I have to give it kudos for a few things. First of all it took the concept of a video game and was willing to go in a different direction but keep some of the main ideas in tact. I mean for the most part video game movies don't really smack any home runs so its good they try something different. Max Payne also succeeds in feeling like the beginning. That means they could continue to serialize it and even if I think the movie is sub par I would still go back and see a sequel or two sequels because I love sequels...usually. Director John Moore is not a newcomer but he's not exactly a long standing director in Hollywood. Still he has had two very successful and well made remakes under his belt so I think he could easily do Max Payne justice. Much like the video game he tries to give the film a style and a look unique to itself. Its like giving it the Sin City look but a little more vibrant and fast which it needs to be the action movie it aims to be. The story is actually less confusing than I thought it might be and still entertains and keeps things going quickly.The most impressive thing to me is that Mark Wahlberg recovers full circle from the DISASTER that was The Happening (see my review.) The guy shouldn't even have a career after that mess. But it turns out Wahlberg does an amazing job as Max Payne. Dark and broody and tough as nails he really embodies the character and proves he should be an action star and stick with that. Mila Kunis is Wahlberg's unwilling partner Mona Sax who helps Wahlberg investigate her sister's death. I still can't quite believe how useless and completely pointless her character is. She is not there for a romance story because there isn't one and would ruin Max Payne's character. She likes to tote around automatic weapons and kick some butt but she has such little to do. Beau Bridges who is an amazing actor gets nothing but a campy side role that doesn't even begin to do him justice. The twist in the story that he is involved in is very transparent and even when it all comes to fruition it does nothing for his character. No one in the supporting cast really stands out including Ludicrous (yes the rapper) and Chris ""What the hell happened to my career"" O'Donnell who is barely a footnote in the film.So it is safe to say that one of the things the film lacked was character development in the sub characters. Kunis was hyped as a co-star and she is barely existent and you could literally remove her character from the film and not notice. However Wahlberg is terrific, if not surprisingly so, as Max Payne and I don't think anyone else could play the role now. He was perfectly cast and I hope he considers doing more of them. Its true what many reviewers say that the film has very little baring on the video game but as mentioned I have no problem with that. I even think the addition of the super natural element actually added a certain something unique to the film and the style fit the content. However this film could have perfected with an R rating or NC 17 or whatever the heck they call it now because it should have been mind blowingly violent and gritty. But they rarely do that with films now. Better characters, even more development with Max Payne's character would have really rounded out this film. Unfortunately parts of it seemed campy, and there was a fair share of glaring plot holes that never come together. Overall a fair film that will entertain on a Saturday night but certainly won't gain action classic status. 7/10",Max Payne
30,MLDinTN,silly idea,4,23 August 2009,"This movie wasn't very good. It's not really a supernatural movie, but the way it is depicted it makes it seem so. These guys take a drug developed by the military and it makes them hallucinate. They see black demon looking things flying around. Apparently when it shows them, they are just supposed to be the delusions and not real. It was very confusing. And of course the trusted best friend turns out to be dirty. How many times have we seen that in a movie. And I don't know what happened to Mila Kunis. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall she was great and hot, in this she looked horrible and had nothing to do. I don't know why her character was even in the film. And Mark Wahlberg wasn't much better as detective Max Payne whom is hunting down those responsible for his wife's murder.FINAL VERDICT: From reading other reviews, I found out this movie is based on a video game which I have never seen.

Now I am no fan of the games but I've played them a long time ago, and i couldn't help, but feel a bit disappointed when the the credits started rolling. Many of my friends told me that this movie is very lack-luster and not adapted great with the game and after seeing this film, I agree with them The atmosphere is very dark and swallow and Mark Wahlberg does a decent job but in all honesty this movie could have been much better with a better script and had they stayed to the game. The story is quite similar to that of the first game, which meant that I never really managed to get excited about the story since i'd played the games, and therefor found it predictable. One great thing about this movie is the scenes, the picture and effects are amazing. The movie takes place in the middle of a snow storm, so the colors are kept cold, but with red providing a contrast. This works very well and helps the movie capture the cool atmosphere from the games.The movie isn't really that bad but I understand why many critics and fans of the video games hate it, since it doesn't seem a like what their used to playing. The movie also seemed rather boring in its first part (about the first 50 mins), then the action came in place. Its still far from great. I like a few scenes towards the end, like the shooting scenes and the scenes with Wahlberg and Mila Kunis.
As a rewatch 06/07/20' and nearly 10 years since the initial watch, opinions remain relatively same. Some decent action scenes but a majority of the film isn't that engaging or interesting. The scenery is nice and is possibly the highlight. Having forgot that this was PG13, but realizing had it been R rated (as the games), perhaps it would have been received better.",Max Payne
34,johnnyboyz,Just a dreadful pseudo-noir exploring limp ideas under an adolescent canopy; thus close to maximum Payne is inflicted on the audience.,4,28 November 2009,"I can remember the Max Payne video game; I can remember playing it around about the time the Playstation 2 was still relatively new and my interest in all things crime and noir (within media texts, of course) was peaking. This was thanks to all manner of strange things, such as regular access to fellow video game Grand Theft Auto III and 1999 Mel Gibson film Payback. That was then, this is now - and while noir has since gone on to become favourite film genre and my interest in video games has waned (although Grand Theft Auto 4 offers some harmless, nostalgic, crime-infused entertainment now and again), stumbling across things like the cinematic adaptation of a game that played its part in my life, years ago, is a strange and somewhat distorting experience. It is doubly sad as much as it is just plain damn annoying that I have to report the adaptation is rubbish.From Max Payne director John Moore's CV, he does adaptations and remakes; he does re-interpretations and updates. Prior to Max Payne, The Omen and The Flight of the Pheonix received this treatment, and while I haven't seen either of them, coming into his third re-interpretation of any text should see him with enough experience of this ilk to deliver something somewhere near decent. It's with a heavy heart and a somewhat annoying sense that you have to point out Max Payne is, critically, the worst received of the three. What more can you say about a film that put more effort into the closing credits sequence than into the whole of the rest of the film itself? The only gripes I have with noir material of any kind is when it's actually an action film masquerading as noir. Recent French produced film (but with very American sensibilities) Taken did this but sort of got away with it thanks to some nicely choreographed action sequences and an intelligible narrative. There was a knowing sense about Taken, one that saw it identify what it was and keep to it. Max Payne masquerades as hard-boiled pulp fiction with a gruff and humourless lead at the centre of it all still struggling to get over what lecturers at screen writing seminars like to refer to as a 'past tragedy'. What it actually is, is a teen-orientated action film with a labyrinth of a nonsense plot; several scenes that I think are supposed to be dramatic and heartfelt but are just unintentionally funny, as well as some horrid acting performances.Max Payne is a one-part revenge film; one-part supernatural thriller; one-part social commentary; one-part blockbuster and one-part neo noir. To say it fails on all fronts would be sugar coating that particular criticism. The Razzie nominated Mark Wahlberg plays the titular role, a squashed face; grumbling voice; leather jacket-clad; badge wielding detective named Max Payne who's based in the thriving, bustling metropolis that is New York City. It begins Sunset Blvd. style, with a guy narrating as he floats in some water. The plot sees a murder happen, in flashback, then another murder happens – that of a Russian girl Max was with and he's the prime suspect when his wallet is found beside her body. But this New York City sees Russian and Jamaican gangs sporadically turning up desperately trying to look mean; strange winged beasts popping up and doing their thing; tattooists in grotty parlours having access to old, colourless books on Nordic mythology, plus, the world's most inaccurate SWAT team.Most of the film's problems revolve around its attitudes towards the audience in relation to its premise. The film is certified '15' over here in Britain, and carries a similarly lightweight rating in America. The sorts of themes and ideas the film covers are trivialised. There is the murdering of one's wife and baby and the shadowy goings-on by both the state and a very capitalist driven company of whom rows and rows of office cubicles and towering skyscrapers act as semiotic driven pieces of iconography representing this capitalism, or society, as a whole: the very same society that took away our lead's family. In terms of making back the money, Moore destroys the real essence of what noir's supposed to be with the inclusion of some strange winged creatures. The producers reckon anyone that's played the game is going to see it and noir enthusiasts will might see it but the buck stops there, so the inclusion of these creatures broadens the audience horizon and will get those in that don't care much for noir and didn't ever play the game but like a bit of horror or material of a supernatural nature.Moore sets his film in a New York that shifts from heavy snow to pouring rain and then back again – what with all the melted snow in between snowfalls and the rain on top of this, shouldn't the streets be flooded? I think Moore wanted the film in black and white, since the snow on the ground and the black clothing and grim cinematography combine to create an as black-and-white look as possible but 100% would be death at the box office. Graffiti peppers the walls of most apartment blocks advertising the drug Valkyr, with a big 'V' accompanying a syringe, but you don't inject the drug, you drink it. Max will meet a certain Mona Sax (Kunis), who wants whom Max wants dead, but she does nothing for about an hour then shoots some guys at the end – I think she exists in the film to wear a leather trench-coat and hold a big gun; Kunis looks unsure in the role, she's punching above her weight. I wish there was more to admire; I wish there was more fun to be had out of it; but over all else, I wished I was watching Payback again about an hour in.",Max Payne
35,TheMovieDiorama,"Max Payne may not be the worst video game adaptation but it's still a ""payne""-ful experience.",4,5 June 2018,"Having never played any games from this franchise, I can only solely base my thoughts on the film itself. And honestly, it's not terrible. Granted it's not 'Silent Hill' or 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' good but it certainly isn't 'Alone in the Dark' or 'DOA: Dead or Alive' atrocious. A homicide detective seeks revenge for the murder of his wife and child, to which he soon comes across a company producing chemicals to aggressively enhance soldiers. 'Jacob's Ladder' meets any other generic revenge thriller, although this iteration lacks any thrills. Having done some rapid research (thank you Wikipedia), it seems at first the story stays true to the source material for the outset. Norse mythology, identical characters and similarities in plot points, regardless the narrative still felt like an incoherent illogical illusory mess. The non-existent character development resulted in any plot twists (if you can call them that) to be negated. It plays the old ""good guy is bad guy"" card and it delivered nothing to the table. The character of Payne himself should be emotionally vulnerable, everything he loved has now instantly dissipated. Emptiness. Sorrow. Melancholy. Instead, we get Wahlberg scowling and walking as if he owns the city whilst simply talking his lines. No expression, just talking. He might have the physicality correct, but lacks emotional conviction. The supporting cast were forgettable, that also includes Kunis, simply proclaiming ""oh no...it's Max Payne!"". Aesthetically, I adored the noir style. Glossy, atmospheric and reminiscent of 'Sin City'. Moore directed this to ""max""-imum potential. Action was well executed, the Valkyrie imagery was ominous and he convincingly made the environment its own character. The tower siege in the third act was chaotic and visually impressive, particularly the Valkyrie hallucinations which tear apart the building. Is it style over substance? I suspect so. Just a shame that the cast and screenplay melt away what could've been a decent crime mystery.",Max Payne
36,Captain_Couth,Bad video game to movies: Max Payne,5,8 March 2009,"Max Payne (2008) is a terrible adaptation of the video game of the same name. Donnie Wahlberg stars as Max Payne a man on a mission, what kind? I don't know because it's a very vague one. The dark and glossy movie has nothing to do with the video game except the name of the lead character and the title. I was very disappointed with the film. I mean Mila Kunis is hot and so is that tall Russian chick but other than that, it's not worth watching unless you want to see a real expensive shoot 'em up action movie.If you are a huge mark for the series then you wouldn't like this movie. It'll just make you angry. But if you like senseless films that have a lot of shooting and CGI effects then by all means enjoy.Not recommended",Max Payne
37,thinker1691,""" In Norse mythology, the Valkries would carry away the valiant to Vallhalla """,9,28 August 2009,"The world military is always seeking the formula for the perfect soldier. Ironically enough the formula was already discovered in the 1880's by Dr,Victor Frankenstein. Several thousand were created by the Nazi's during the second world war. The ultimate soldier is a mindless automaton who carries out his instructions without hesitation or conscience. The question remains what happens when these soldiers are released from duty? This film "" Max Payne "" is one answer. In the film, a huge pharmaceutical conglomerate, is responsible for the next step in a soldier's future. A New York police officer's wife and son are murdered and for three years the case remains unsolved. The officer, Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) transfers to the Cold Case unit and continues to investigate without success. However, the grizzly death of a sexy, mysterious woman and his partner's brutal murder, reveals unusual clues which involves Payne's friend BB Hensley (Beau Bridges). Together with Mona Sax (Mila Kunis), the sister of the murder girl, Payne is thrown back into the fray. The entire movie is draped with dark, winged creatures and an army of drug-crazed soldiers all seeking to prevent Payne from uncovering the truth about his wife's killer. Black drama, physical confrontations, explosive action and a plethora of dark images shroud this exciting film. Walberg gives a highly charges performance and surprisingly so does Mila Kunis whom we last seen in 'that 70's show. The result is a great film and one which is destined to become a Classic. ****",Max Payne
38,DarkVulcan29,"Not has good as Mortal Kombat(1995), but better then Super Mario Brothers(1993).",5,18 October 2008,"I'm a big fan of the game, I was excited when I heard there was gonna be a movie version. I won't beat around the bush, Mark Wahlberg is a good actor, but he would not be my first choice, I always thought that Tom Cruise would be a better fit in the role. But none the less Mark plays it to the best to his advantage. Now I understand they can't totally copy elements of the game, but while watching the movie it became clear that the screenwriter never played the game. He just heard of the story, and used that instead. Which was alright at times. But the problem is that they used little elements of the game instead. That got annoying for me, because it felt like a cheap shot to the game. Because unlike the game, the movie start to drag has it begins. I liked it when it began to pick up. The other problems is that there are too many characters in the film, that are not developed enough, they just get thrown in front of us. The movie does have some great action scenes, and descent performances by Mark Wahlberg, Beau Bridges, and Mila Kunis. But the ending could have used more imagination. Although it does have its moments, in my opinion the game was better. I'm amazed this movie managed to sneak by with a PG-13 rating.I would not rate the movie as a hit with Mortal Kombat, I'd put it with Doom, Hit-Man, and the Resident Evil series, as not bad but alright. At least it wasn't as awful as Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, and Double Dragon.",Max Payne
39,MBunge,Perhaps the epitome of bad video game movies,3,27 March 2011,"Oh, brother. This movie is what people mean when they complain about big screen adaptations of video games. Not that this is the worst ever such production. It's just that Max Payne has probably got every single flaw that is so stereotypical of video game films. Characters that are nothing but attractive facades? Check. Dialog that wouldn't make the grade in a first year film school class? Check. A plot that not only makes little sense in general but specifically and needlessly contradicts itself on several different occasions? Check. Completely superfluous special effects? Check. A complete absence of any overarching theme or subtext? Check. A movie that no one in their right mind would have ever made if there weren't already millions of people who played the game it's based on? Check and double check.Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a police detective still haunted by the unsolved murder of his wife. Then this Russian skank he meets at a party gets ripped to pieces outside his apartment, with Payne's ID found next to the body parts. Then his former partner gets killed in Payne's apartment and he's considered the prime suspect. Just when you think the story's going to kill Payne's dog or his long lost Aunt Frieda, the plot of this thing finally kicks in and Payne starts uncovering a corporate secret that's behind all the death. Aided by the Russian skank's slightly less skanky but much more violent sister (Mila Kunis), Payne sets out towell, he sort of.what I mean is that Payneaw, screw it. There was sooooooo much exposition and sooooooo little logic to what happened that I can barely remember it, even though I watched the movie just last night. Suffice it to say that if I had an acupuncture needle stuck into me every time something stupid occurred in this film, I'd have looked like an inbred porcupine before it was halfway done.I've never played the game, so I can't tell you how faithful this motion picture is to it. Did the video game constantly tell you what a badass Max Payne was while the character wandered around looking less threatening than your average dildo? Did the bad guys in the game have such horrific aim that when they tried to shoot Max Payne they ended up hitting something 10 feet to the left of him? Where things in the game blown up for no apparent purpose? When the game ended, did you have no idea what became of one of the major characters? Where the boss fights all terribly anti-climactic? If all that was in the game, then this film is an extremely scrupulous adaptation.Outside of the strange sight of seeing Chris O'Donnell playing a third banana character in a Mark Wahlberg vehicle, there's nothing here for any viewer.",Max Payne
40,MaxBorg89,Payne in the ass!,5,30 December 2008,"Poor Mark Wahlberg. Ever since he obtained a fully deserved Oscar nomination for The Departed, he has struggled to hit it as big again: Shooter was enjoyable but unmistakably shallow, We Own the Night received very mixed reactions, and The Happening was one of the most unjustly panned movies of 2008 (well, minus the plastic plant scene). None of those, however, is as bad as Max Payne, which just about tails The Truth About Charlie for the title of Wahlberg's career low.But hey, few people expected Payne to be any good in the first place. For starters, it's based on a video game, and those never turn out well on film. Secondly, it's directed by John Moore, whose body of work is all but encouraging (he remade The Omen, for crying out loud). Plus, it comes off as a mix of fantasy, action and revenge thriller - in short, a mess.For those not familiar with the game, the story centers on the titular cop (Wahlberg), a brilliant homicide detective who's been reassigned after the brutal murder of his wife and kid. When a Ukrainian girl (Olga Kurylenko) is found dead with his wallet in her pocket, he's immediately charged with the murder, and the only way to clear himself is to find a thug named Lupino (Amaury Nolasco), who might even have something to do with Mrs. Payne's death (go figure..).With some minor adjustments, this could easily be the latest installment of Death Wish. If only things were that simple: the plot is twisted even more with a subplot concerning a mind-altering drug called Valkyr, which makes everything look like Hell on screen and destroys Norse mythology's credibility off screen. Then again, decent scripts are rare when it comes to this sort of flick, so Moore is supposed to redeem himself with visuals and action scenes: in the first case, he delivers more than enough; in the second, he disappoints, and big time - not counting the first ten minutes and the last twenty, there's a serious lack of pace and ass-kicking.Last but not least, the acting. Wahlberg does pretty much the same he did in Shooter: gritty and watchable, but never exploits his huge potential. Mila Kunis, who plays the ""Payne girl"" (sorry, couldn't resist), is totally miscast, being too young and with the wrong background (That '70s Show), except for the fact that she is of Ukrainian descent like her on-screen sister Kurylenko. Beau Bridges, generally a fine presence, manages the unenviable task of becoming worse as the picture progresses, and Nolasco's villain is as lifeless as they come (and let's not even get started on Ludicrous' ""acting"").Long story short: if this were a game, it would reach the ""Game over"" stage after twenty minutes. Compared to this, even Tomb Raider looks decent enough.",Max Payne
41,juneebuggy,Felt like a movie Nicholas Cage should have been in,6,26 January 2016,"While this was a visually impressive movie filled with stylish action sequences and a decent cast the plot was so all over the place that I didn't know if I was watching a revenge thriller or a supernatural fantasy. I guess ultimately it was both, with Mark Wahlberg taking the lead as a grieving cop out to avenge the murder of his family.As his investigation evolves he hooks up with a Russian assassin (Mila Kunis) and events take a supernatural turn involving super soldiers, blue drugs and flying demons so that this wound up feeling like a movie Nicholas Cage should have been in.The style and overall vibe of this movie is great though, all dark and comic book-esque, (apparently based on a video game, who knew) The action is decent too including a couple of cool looking shootouts done in slow motion. I generally like revenge movies and I did find parts of this interesting but it just kept going off the rails and losing me.The cast kept surprising me (Beau Bridges, Ludicrous, Chris O'Donnell) but ultimately I just didn't care. The final rooftop scene with Mark screaming into the heavens, Nicholas cage would have been awesome doing that. 1/2/16",Max Payne

Mark Wahlberg is actually very good in his role here as the tough Detective Max Payne & he plays exactly how i expected him to play it & that's straight forward hard & ""Punisher"" like & he delivered so his performance was fine & made for a Cool tough vigilante cop as he searches about the very dark, snowy & cold New York City to track down the murderer of his wife & baby some 3 yrs ago & that's how surprising dark this Noir Thriller actually is & for a film based on a video game i was surprised by it's mature darkness & old School Noir nature.
There's plenty of Mystery surrounding this story & the usual Corruption from people you trust & high places but it's done well & looks fantastic abit like a Graphic Novel in style & yes a little similar to Sin City but not as comic book as that & it has a solid Cop Thriller feel & like i said Wahlberg is decent as our lead, well Mark Wahlberg is an excellent actor anyway in many films but this Max Payne was always a hated one of his films but i finally watched it in 2021 & i enjoyed it.At times There's a strange nightmare feel to the film & some cool & freaky imagery & some Awesome action scenes & surprisingly not very bloody but entertaining & Cool still.

43,kluseba,An impressive atmosphere worthy of a film noir meet an intriguing story with a few length and a surprisingly solid acting,8,23 May 2012,"Even though the movie got a bunch of negative critics by fans of the game series, I happen to like ""Max Payne"" a lot for different reasons.First of all, the movie is visually stunning and develops an amazingly intense and constant film noir atmosphere.Second, the acting is surprisingly good for this kind of movie and offers a couple of very intriguing characters that represent the outsiders of a pitiless society. I never had a too favourable opinion of actors such as Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis or Olga Kurylenko but they are very convincing in this movie and almost left me speechless at some points. The fact that many stars have some minor roles or cameo appearances keeps the movie quite interesting and I like to see celebrities such as Ludicrous or Nelly Furtado in this film.The third strong point of the flick is its story. The plot is quite dark and mysterious and offers some minor surprises. It's certainly not the script of the year and in the end, there are some predictable scenes and also a couple of lengths in this stylish anti-hero blockbuster but it's definitely better than I thought and easily beats many similar superhero movies that flood the markets nowadays or adoptions from computer games or visual novels. From that categorization, I would even say that this movie is one of the best of its kind.I must admit that this movie focuses a lot more on the atmospheric part than on stunning action scenes as there were in the games. I think this is a positive thing for a movie and adds a lot of depth and originality to this adaption. The few action sequences are still well done but not quite outstanding. From that point if view the games were definitely more gripping and innovating.In the end, I have seen this movie a couple of times by now and find it all very entertaining, visually impressive and intriguing from the beginning to the end. Anybody that likes ""Sin City"" or ""The Spirit"" might adore this movie and I even think its the most profound feature of these three.",Max Payne

Which the video game had plenty. I always thought Peter Krause (From the ""Six Feet Under"" fame) truly did looked like Max Payne from the video game. But Wahlberg did play the role extremely well and he surprised me with his performance. Die Hard fans of the game will have mixed feelings towards the film.

The pace of the film was also on point. The only problem I had with it was perhaps casting. Ludicrous as the detective was off, Mila Kunis as a mysterious Russian was also weird but Mark Wahlberg did well up until the last five minutes or so of the film. The scenes with his wife 'Michele ""Not Yet Max"" Payne' were so unbelievable especially given the fact that Max had spurned the advances of two major babes during the first 90 minutes of the film. That said, I think what got to most people was the fact that the film was rated PG-13 and not R.

48,lewiskendell,Another failed video game adaptation.,3,29 January 2016,"Making a movie based on a video game is always a risky proposition, and Max Payne is yet another example of how NOT to do it. Personally, I thought that too much time had passed since the Max Payne games were popular. Why even make this now? The property isn't nearly classic enough to still be recognized by the current crop of gamers who probably don't even remember it. Yes, this has nothing to do with why the movie itself was so bad, but it puzzled me all the same.Anyway, back to the movie. I almost feel sorry for Mark Wahlberg, because for a talented actor, he sure chose to be in some terrible movies in 2008. The Happening was mediocre in every way, but Max Payne is past awful. Did he not read this script before signing on? Story exposition comes from random characters with one minute of screen time, people show up in places they have no reason to be just in time for important plot points, and I'm still not sure who some of the characters were even supposed to be. Add that to an appalling directing job and some of the weirdest facial expressions that I've ever seen (especially Mark, he looks constipated 75% of the time). Even the action scenes don't satisfy. A piece of debris falls directly onto a lone police car, just so it can explode? And we're supposed to be entertained by that? I don't think so. And Olga Kurylenko and Mila Kunis are WASTED. How is that even possible? Olga is on-screen for maybe 5 minutes, and they managed to make Mila, somehow, look unattractive. They can't make an exciting movie out of a game based entirely on shooting, but they managed to make a gorgeous woman look like crap? My head is still trying to wrap around that. My point is, there's not any redeeming qualities in this disaster.I pity anyone who buys this turd tomorrow, hoping for a good action movie. I hope Mark got a ginormous paycheck for this, because it knocked my opinion of him as an actor down a few notches.

The movie resolves one issue but leaves a whole host just dangling - obviously a plug for a sequel, but way too obviously such; I wanted to see a whole film, not a teaser for the next episode.In many ways, this cheat of a twist at the end is reflective of repeated failures to deliver the goods throughout the film. A new romance for the hero is hinted at and never arrives; some action sequences are Woo-like set-pieces, but others end abruptly with no sense of satisfaction; the worst of it is the element of mystery - which never arrives. The clues are revealed in a confusing manner, and don't really add up - yet the solution is painfully obvious, almost from the beginning.Others have remarked the lack of any sense of humor, the uninteresting characterizations, the drab world and even more drab world-view. I wasn't the big fan of the Max Payne game that others are, but even I recognize that there's a certain wit, a mood, and - yes, despite its being a game - humanity in the game that is lacking from the film.But it's the cheap tease of the film that really disappoints.

51,bob-rutzel-1,So-So,5,30 January 2009,"Detective Max Payne (Walberg) is after whoever killed his wife and partner.Well, at least Mr. Wahlberg is back in a role that suits him best and not playing around with woof-woof movies like The Happening. He's does good in these thrillers, and it's okay to be an up-tight character from time to time, but always? Ah, but the problem is that video games don't leave much room for character development, humor, and a sense of humanity. This movie is based upon a video game and it's Game-On from beginning to end until all the bad guys are put away. One would think the director would lighten up for a couple minutes and pretend this is a good guy in a regular movie trying to do the right thing. Payne is a good guy, but is more than uptight in this not so regular movie.The acting, dialogue, and stunts were all good. I almost didn't recognize Chris O Donnell (he used to be Batman's Robin) as he must have found the cookies in the kitchen in the Bat Cave and never left.But, as video games are hell-bent on action, that is what we get in here and it's non-stop. At least the stunts and shootings don't go on forever and ever and that's a good thing.Most of the scenes were night scenes and it was always either raining or snowing in those scenes. I guess most video games are best played at night in bad weather.There are some aspects of this being a supernatural thriller in that we have dark soldier-angels flying around and either killing or helping to kill and where they came from is never really explained. There is a drug that does make one become a super-soldier in a sense, but this also is not really fully developed. In a video game, nothing needs to be explained, but in a regular people movie it would have helped.I would say if you are going to make a regular people movie out of a video game, keep in mind we are not all Gamers, and prefer some explanations and to be entertained with a regular people-type movie, and not something So-So.

52,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Max Payne""- A mildly enjoyable but ultimately mediocre action-flick that pales in comparison to its far superior video-game source material.",4,31 August 2017,"Perhaps the greatest tragedy that can befall a film is also one of the most simple mistakes that can be made during the filmmaking process- the failure to meet potential. The inability to live up to the promise of a story or an idea. And arguably in no other film is this idea exemplified more than in director John Moore's 2008 release ""Max Payne."" Because not only did the film fail to meet its potential... it failed to meet its potential after that potential had already been realized in the far superior video-game on which it is loosely based. The original 2001 game ""Max Payne"" was a pioneering and groundbreaking release that made keen use of cinematic storytelling, top-notch voice talent and Hollywood-level screen writing to realize a dark and grim tale of vengeance and crime. It was almost a movie in itself already- it merely needed to be translated from one medium to another.Unfortunately, an army of producers and one of the most inept filmmakers in modern cinema saw it differently, and decided that rather than honor the original, they would go out of their way to change it. And it resulted in something that while occasionally aesthetically entertaining to watch, ultimately feels vapid and empty... merely coasting by with the most basic and bland of clichés, and only occasionally giving us brief glimpses of the brilliance seen in the source material. In essence, a truly unique modern noir tale became a generic studio hack-job. But what else can we expect from the same director who single-handedly destroyed the ""Die Hard"" franchise?Max Payne (Mark Whalberg) is a man lost- a cold-case police detective haunted by the murder of his wife and infant child. Obsessed with the case, he tracks down criminals in an attempt to solve the mystery of why they were killed and who is responsible. Following various leads and tips, Max eventually begins to piece together a conspiracy that might have something to do with the death of his family... a conspiracy involving a mysterious hallucinogenic drug and an equally mysterious young woman named Mona (Mila Kunis) who might be the key to everything...To give some praise where it is deserved, there are indeed a few moments peppered in here and there that work, in addition to a few solid turns from a talented cast. Whalberg and Kunis are both more than adequate in their roles and do the parts as much justice as the script allows. In the hands of a better writer and a better director, they could have been perfect. I also really enjoyed Donal Logue and Beau Bridges in smaller supporting roles. The color palette is a good translation of the source material and what little action there is is typically well-executed, even if Moore fumbles in trying to replicate the game's trademark ""bullet time"" action set- pieces. As a result, I do think that audiences unfamiliar with the source material might be able to get some surface-level thrills from the proceedings. But that's all it is... surface-level thrills without proper substance behind them. You could say that it almost feels like a true ""Max Payne"" tale... almost...Unfortunately, you can't help but feel completely apathetic towards the movie as a whole because it seems that Moore and writer Beau Thorne fundamentally misunderstand the appeal of the franchise and completely fail at capturing the magic of those now-classic games. Like many filmmakers who work on game-to-film adaptations, Moore, Thorne and the various producers behind the film seem utterly convinced that they can do better than the original, and make nonstop and completely superfluous changes to the story that convolutes it instead of enhancing it. When you take something as fresh and unique as the original ""Max Payne"" and try to ""make it better"" by changing it, it looses its freshness and uniqueness. When you change something that's already pretty much perfect, the only way to go is down, which is exactly what happens.So fresh ideas are replaced by generic tropes. Interesting characters are replaced by bland archetypes. And fascinating twists and turns are replaced by dull and overused cliché. It makes the film so much less than it has the potential to be. Not only does it do no justice to the original work, but it also ends up making for a much weaker film even when judged on its own merit. Change, change, change... and all for no reason. Why should we as an audience care about a film if its clear that the filmmakers have no respect whatsoever for the source material or their audience? Combine that with atrociously grating dialog, generally bland visuals outside of the eye-popping action, a confused and unfocused narrative structure and a tamed-down PG-13 rating that feels like it's holding the film back, and you have a recipe for mediocrity.""Max Payne"" might not objectively be a terrible film. But it is most certainly a sorely disappointing one. A symbol of not only Hollywood's continued misunderstanding and mishandling of video-game properties, but also of the terrible sin of failed potential. And so, I give it a below-average 4 out of 10.",Max Payne
53,chrichtonsworld,Can't believe that people actually liked this movie!,2,25 October 2008,"Who cares if the plot is different from the game. This being an adaptation it is to be expected. What i do want to see is that the essence of a game is captured. And without any hesitation I can say that is not the case. ""Max Payne"" the game was a tribute to classic John Woo movies starring ""Chow Yan Fat"" like ""Hard Boiled"" and ""The Killer"" which contained beautifully choreographed action scenes filmed in slow motion. Everyone who had seen one of those movies wanted to be the gun blazing ""Chow Yan Fat"". The game made that possible. The good plot is one of the key elements that provided the special ambiance that made the game stand out from other shooters. However it was not the reason why people played the game. And somehow a lot of people including the ones who made this awful movie missed that point. Bullet Time was the main character in Max Payne the game. Without it Max Payne would never had been as popular as it is now. In the movie there are maybe two and a half scenes where events are slowed down. I know that we are spoiled after ""The Matrix Trilogy"" and several other movies. But how can you exclude it like they did if it plays such an important role. And even if I can forgive them for not using the bullet time effect as much as I wanted to. Why not offering action scenes a la ""Shoot em up"". At least then I would have gotten a fraction of what this movie supposed to show. There are many other topics and flaws I could mention and discuss. But since the action element was the most important one I see no point in going deeper!",Max Payne
54,oneguyrambling,Wahlberg takes a two month paid holiday making this video game adaptation.,5,3 February 2012,"Max Payne has a few things going for it, tone, some creative and frankly striking visuals, Mark Wahlberg channeling his inner Bruce Willis but not enough to elevate it to anything more than a 'decent' video game adaptation. This leaves it with Hit-man and Resident Evil, and perhaps a notch below Silent Hill, but still not very good.Max is a jaded cop on the shelf. Deemed unfit for active duty after his wife and baby are killed, Max shuffles papers and files files in the cold case department of the force, his colleagues told not to poke the bear.But by night Max is quite a deal more active, roaming the seedy underbelly of the crime infested city on the hunt for his families' killers, taking out his frustrations on junkies and low lives – all hooked on the new superdrug 'Valkyr', which apparently gives users its users wings in a far more literal sense than Red Bull can ever claim, in the form of incredibly vivid hallucinations that are practically interactive.With Max edging ever closer to the truth, others provide assistance along the way, his former partner, a junkie woman's sister Mona Sax (Mila Kunis) and a family friend named simply 'BB' (Beau Bridges). Unfortunately when both his former partner and Mona's sister are offed in rapid succession – with Max being implicated in both cases – he falls on the radar of Internal Affairs cop Jim Rivera (Ludacris), and eventually the greater police population also.I think we're supposed to think that the superdrug is just so cool and the fact that the movie liberally sprinkles video game features such as bullet time and a couple of shooter-style sequences is supposed to wow us. The problem is that Max Payne is such a dispassionate and uninspired character – in the literal sense, I'm not suggesting the character is bad.That's OK and totally understandable if you're a grieving husband and father, not though if you are supposed to be an action movie.Add to this two point-docking sins: 1/ Max Payne is a PG version of a well liked violent video game. The 'Unrated' version has three or four kill shots with a bit of blood, but no more real oomph. Making a PG version for an audience familiar with a violent video game is simply a waste of time, and a trap that catches all too many filmmakers lately. I simply put it's no wonder there hasn't yet been a shooting game adaptation that demands attention.2/ No-one told Beau Bridges that it was a film about a video game – not a cartoon. He is simply wrong as BB, and his lamentably cartoonish performance straight up sucks, especially his early scenes where he acts like there's a laugh track playing behind every line he utters. And you have yet another promising film that tries but fails.Final Rating – 5 / 10. Technical proficiency and well loved source material gets you so far, half way to a decent film in fact. But who wants half a decent film?",Max Payne
55,Pumpkin_Man,The Movie I've Waited 7 Long Years To See!!!,6,17 October 2008,"I never thought I'd finally see the cop with nothing to lose up on the big screen! I thought it was awesome! Although they took a lot out from the game and added different things and mixed things up, it was still pretty cool! Mark Wahlberg did a really good job as Max Payne! Mila Kunis was awesome and sexy as Mona Sax! Ludicrous did a good job as Jim Bravura. I didn't care if Bravura was black or not. Three years after his wife and baby are murdered by junkies on a drug called Valkyr, Max browses through old cases and tries to find the 3rd man who killed his wife and baby. At a party, Max meets Natasha, Mona's sister. After doing some Valkyr, Natasha sees some Valkries flying in the air. The next day, Max's old partner, Alex Balder brings Max to the crime because Max's badge was found at the scene of the crime. Later, Alex finds links between Natasha's murder, and Michelle Payne's murder. Alex is found dead at Max's apartment. Mona thinks Max killed her sister, but they find out, they are both after the same person, Jack Lupino. When the FBI are looking for Max because they think he killed Jason Colvin, Max deals with an unthinkable betrayal. When Max is left for dead, he needs to use Valkyr to help him survive. During the end of his bloody revenge, all he can see are hallucinations of fire and Valkries all around him As his rampage leads him to Aesir Corporation to kill the one who murdered his family.

So he goes in search of the killers and finds his beliefs questioned.I've never played the game, but this movie seemed to another bad attempt at a game. The dialogue was dull and the twist became quite obvious as we met Payne 'buddy'....The action scenes were satisfactory and Wahlberg pulled it off, while the appearance of Olga was quite surprising, she is more beautiful than ever, as the cinematography only adds to her stunning looks....I found the idea of a little girl running the 'Russian Mob' hilarious, and totally unbelievable...(Ohh and she carries around a automatic machine gun).It seems Hollywood cannot transfer a 'game' onto the big screen...So I have an idea...

57,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Pretty good for a video game adaptation.,10,19 May 2019,"Very few movies based on video games actually live up to their hype. Most rely on being campy or are so over the top that you can't take them seriously. However, ""Max Payne"" is an exception. Mark Wahlberg was a wise casting decision for his similar looks to the main character of the game, and a real knack for playing the hard-core action hero. For those who are unfamiliar with the video game, this movie provides enough substance to be able to see it without being lost.
""Max Payne"" feels dark and cold, which reflects the emotions left in the main character's heart. The New York City of this film is monochromatic, sticking to drab black, white and brown, thereby accentuating any color that would occasionally appear.
Wahlberg captures the essence of the tragic hero well, and Mila Kunis (who does her best Michelle Rodriquez impression throughout the film) shows the audience that she can do serious roles just as well as her comedic ones. The motif of precipitation mixes well with the embers of the Valkyrie filled hallucinations, but almost to an extreme point of creating rain indoors, just to keep the motif alive.
The action sequences are well done and visually stunning and the plot and characters are relatable enough that anyone should be able to enjoy this movie. Definitely go see this movie in theaters, as there is definitely something about being surrounded by action of this caliber.Make sure you stay after the credits for a teaser for a sequel that never materialized.",Max Payne

Looking like he was searching for ghosts, as many accuse him, he is joined by an assassin with a revenge of her own, in their attempt to solve what seems to be a great conspiracy.To make myself clear from the beginning, this movie is a big disappointment. It had everything it needed to be great, from good actors to a loved franchise, and somehow managed to fail in every attempted aspect. Unlike its video game counterparts, it delivers way too little action, almost no bullet time/slow motion scenes and way too little suspense. It was supposed to be mysterious, full of fighting and shooting with style, as in the game, but somehow, the producers decided that those scenes shouldn't take part. After many boring and predictable events, it decided to bring something interesting by unraveling some of the main intrigue, but it was a bit too little, a bit too late. It brought some thrill with its final part and exaggerated finale but that wasn't enough to raise the bar, even by a small bit.It's another mediocre movie which had more than what it required to be at least good, threw it away and decided to have another ""approach"".

59,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Just another video game adaptation... with a slight plus.,5,26 June 2009,"Perhaps it was inexorable that a game which revolutionized gaming, would be made into a movie by a big studio. Everything is all right with that thought, except the last two words: big studio. Though, perhaps ironically, it is due to those very two words that the money needed to make such a movie was put up to begin with. The problem with studios is that they don't really like to break new ground or venture into dark, or even daring, plot territory. Then if they do, it is all too often simplistically sensational with the usual clichés tagging along. ""Doom"" was a perfect example of this.""Max Payne"" is on one hand a good movie and that is visually. There is lots of interesting detail and the nighttime noir cinematography is actually pretty good AND a very acceptable representation of the game's visuals. However, visually, big studio films are very frequently stunning so that doesn't really make it that much of a surprise, but rather a relief for fans of the game that maybe they got this adaptation down very well.It is not too long into the movie that those very visuals become to seem like a tease. Director John Moore does some pretty interesting things with them - even though those flying demon things are in the game, the visualization of the drug present throughout the game is pretty interesting. It is odd, but not in a bad way. The problems arise with *hold your breath* the plot. Surprised? They get pretty close to making a good adaptation, include good visuals with some new twists, but they mess up the plot... GAH! It's frustrating. The plot seems like it was written by someone who read a one paragraph summary of the game's plot and then compressed it even further by heavily editing the darker plot points in the game's third act.They say give credit where credit's due and here there is SOME credit to be given. For one, the action editing isn't ""hyperfastinsane"" and the shootouts are pretty good for the few of them that there are here - though, very strangely ""bullet-time"" is only shown in one scene and it is not a very good one at that. But again, the visuals are overall good. Though, in the end this is noir film with too little noir, an action film with too little action, and a conspiracy thriller with an underdeveloped and wholly uninspired plot. --- 5/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence",Max Payne

I wanted to ignore the bad reviews but they are accurate. The supernatural aspect is dialled up and yes I know it's drug related, but that wasn't a huge part of the game.

63,PyroSikTh,NOT the Video Game,7,28 March 2009,"Let us note that this film (obviously) isn't the video game. It's a film based on the video game. Slight difference. For one, this is a plot-driven film rather than a mindless action flick/shoot 'em up.Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a cop tortured by the death of his wife and child, and he is hell-bent on finding who did it. He starts from the bottom and works his way up the hierarchy, uncovering military secrets along the way, which just lead him to climb higher. The film opens with Max Payne falling in icy waters with a film noir-esquire monologue. It's a shame this monologue is so short and one of the few narrations, but it's enough to make the viewer wonder why he's there. From there it goes back in time and develops it's way back to that point. Along the way he meets Natasha Sax (Olga Kurylenko) and her sister Mona Sax (Mila Kunis). Unfortunately, I don't feel either of them, particularly Mona Sax got enough development or screen time.The visuals are very good and certainly quite creepy. The finale is certainly a high point in cinema special effects, and the cinematography is expertly done with some scenes as photographic and artistic as those in Road to Perdition. There's also a good soundtrack that helps the viewer to emphasise and feel the emotions Max feels. This ranks amongst my top films.",Max Payne

I know it got slated in the reviews and a lot of people said it was rubbish, but it was good.The film is based on a a computer game. Normally computer game based movies are rubbish (but even the rubbish ones I quite like for cheesy reasons). But this is an exception.The movie is about a police officer whose wife and baby gets murdered. He then spends the movie trying to find the killer.The film stars Mark Wahlberg as Max. Also we have Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges, Ludicrous & Chris O'Donnell. The acting was pretty good and the action was great. There was some great action scenes which were all through the movie.I loved the feel of this film... it reminded me a little bit of Sin City. This film is in colour, but it has a comic book feel to it. The effects were really good.There was one scene in the film though that I thought didn't really belong in the film... there was a scene where Max was having a gun fight... and he jumped backwards in slow motion to kill a guy behind him... but it was a really too slow. I don't mind slow motion moments in some movies, but it really didn't feel right at that point of the film. It just felt out of place for me.The other part of this film I loved was the demons... there is a drug going around in the story line and whoever takes this drug sees this black, flying demon chasing them. The demons looked amazing. Such good effects and probably the best thing about this movie. It really made the movie feel creepy and added to the suspense.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A lot better than expected... hopefully a sequel might be on the cards.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Max Payne

Although if the director or producer actually played the games they would probably be able to craft something a little more entertaining next time. Mark Wahlberg is usually a personal favourite of mine but I feel he was let down by a terrible script.The games are amazing, I've always been a die hard fan of them, the way the story comes together i compelling and the way this story comes together is just draining and I dont recommend it to anyone, its enough to put you off the Max Payne series even though its incredible. I do have to note that there were a few intriguing fight scenes but that's as good as it got for me.I was just as let down as Wahlberg was when I watched this, utterly disappointed and its such a shame, they had potential but it failed as some do.",Max Payne
68,rowmorg,Nice art direction but a shame about the rest of it,5,15 September 2009,"A drug to induce confidence in soldiers is called alcohol, e.g. the alcoholic Winston Churchill, or speed, which Churchill also used. Nazi Germany had a range of drugs they fed to, for example, fighter pilots, who flew across the English Channel at 10 feet altitude under the radar and surprise-blitzed my home town of Brighton. Drugs for fighters is absolutely nothing new, so the idea behind Max Payne is, shall we say, unoriginal? Anyway, the angle here is very typically American, in that a mammoth drug company is making giant profits merchandising its war-dope to the Pentagon, again, nothing very new about that, but at least a wrinkle of originality. It compares with the shameless marketing of Viagra to the US public, as if American malehood was flaccid, something the inexorable increase of population (http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html) denies. What doesn't work in this movie is that the drug is a hallucinatory that gives the fighters apocalyptic visions of dark angels wheeling above, tearing buildings apart and throwing people to their destruction. Counterproductive, it would seem!As with so many movies, the script breaks with the rules by having its hero take the drugs, and thus depart from his position in our minds of normality and competence. But by this point in the movie, anyone still watching will doubtless be beyond caring about the state of mind of Max Payne. BTW, that name Max Payne is also unoriginal. Its derivation from ""maximum pain"" is in turn derivative from Max Headroom, the character who draws his name from signs on elevator walls.This is another of those vampire films that sucks the life out of you and spills you out on to the street feeling empty: quite the opposite of what a genuine work of art does. It is entirely concerned with gunplay, hopelessly inaccurate by the baddies, brilliantly focused by Max, and lovingly screens all the weapons as the titles scroll at the end. Not a scrap of sexual revelation in the whole two hours. Forget it.",Max Payne
69,xamtaro,"Muddier plot than the over-hyped ""dark noir"" visuals that saps all the fun out of the game",6,10 January 2010,"Max Payne was a revolutionary game for its time that combined drew its inspiration from the best of Hollywood action and detective noir films. It was only natural that the story be re-told in the medium that inspired it. So how could a film based on a video game whose main influences were films in the first place turn out such a boring mess? The story follows the quest of detective Max Payne, a bitter cop who works in the ""cold case"" unit of the NYPD. A few years earlier, his wife and baby were murdered driving Max into despair and kick starting his obsession with finding their killer. Following a tip off that leads from a confrontation with some thugs in a railway toilet to a meeting with the beautiful Natasha Sax and the scowling Jack Lupino at a drug party. Max tries getting information from Natasha based on a tattoo she has that looks similar to a symbol from his wife's old case file but the sexy foreigner tries to seduce him. This only angers the detective who promptly asks her to leave. The next day, Natasha's body is found decapitated in an alley way and Max is the prime suspect. Still adamant on following up on his family's murder case, the final straw comes when his partner, Alex Balder, is murdered and the blame once again falls on Max. With the NYPD threatening to take him off the case, a criminal conspiracy that leads right up to the most powerful corporation in the city and the revelation of the true purpose behind the mystery drug Valkyr, Max is on a race against time to right the injustice that was forced upon him.It all sounds pretty intense, except there are only 3 big action scenes in the entire movie. Where the game was a guns blazing fight for survival every second, the movie is a sombre brooding and almost sleep inducing experience. Most of the time, the plot involves Max going from one place to another, deadpan neutral expression plastered across his face, talking to some people, finding some clue and then heading off somewhere else. Along the way he meets up with token dangerous gun-girl Mona Sax, the usual ""just doing his job"" police chief Bravura and ""old friend"" BB. Even without being compared to the game, this show is no better off as a stand along movie. Though the actors play their parts well, all the characters come across as very plain. Max is especially uninteresting despite being the main character though this is more the fault of the half hearted writing than Mark Wahlberg's acting. Thankfully, there is enough mystery and surprises in the narrative like any good detective movie. Red herrings, flashbacks, eerie foreshadowing narration and other trademarks of classic film noir detective stories manage to creep in, heightening the experience. It may not be a worthwhile successor to the golden age of film noir but it is a passable tribute to that genre of movies. At very least, the subplot about the aggression boosting but hallucinogenic nature of the Valkyr drug as well as some amazing special effects during the hallucination scenes about demonic Valkyries and hellfire manages to add some air of freshness to this yawn-fest of a movie. Also, The final gun fight where Max Payne takes on an entire building's security detail looks a lot better in the DVD's unrated version. While the creative team had managed to capture the dark nihilistic look of the game's cinematic visuals complete with the ominous atmosphere, they chose to move away from the action heavy nature of the games and replace it with a messy detective revenge story that plods along for its 103 minute duration. Fans of the game and those expecting John Woo styled gun fights would find the entire experience a paynefully boring one as ""Max Payne"" is merely a mildly entertaining mystery genre detective story that feels like a glorified art-house episode of CSI given a big budget CGI mask. Only good for what it is and nothing more.",Max Payne
70,theshadow908,"Ignore the game, enjoy the movie.",7,21 November 2008,"Max Payne tells the story of a former New York City homicide detective whose wife and baby daughter were killed by a gang of drug addicts. He now works a desk job in the cold case department, hoping to uncover a lead that might lead him to catch his family's killers. Without the knowledge of his superiors, he goes out every night tracking leads and interrogating suspects. His investigation leads him to an underground drug circle that is using a new drug called Valkyr that gives its users frightening hallucinations, sometimes driving them to suicide. He discovers the drug may have something to do with his family's death and he begins tracing it to the source, uncovering a conspiracy in a corporation his wife used to work for.If you played the Max Payne video game and thought the story and action sequences were amazing, and you now want to see this movie in hopes of getting a similar story, you're going to be disappointed, that's a fact. The way I was able to enjoy this film was by not comparing it to the game, and just viewing it as a fun cop movie staring Mark Whalberg. I know that can be hard because there's certain things from the game you want to see translated, and when they're missing you get a little annoyed. I just reminded myself, ""This isn't the game. This is a movie."" I felt there was enough of the game in this film to keep me from being turned off. The tone of the game was well portrayed in the tone of the film. The darkness, both figuratively and literally, the constant blizzard, a lot of the characters. The settings in the film were almost dead on, which was impressive. A few bullet time sequences were even put in, one being the very cool scene shown in the trailer where Max Payne fires a shotgun while diving backwards. I was also glad that the trailer mislead us into thinking the Valkyries in the film were real and then surprised us by revealing them to be hallucination.I mostly enjoyed this film as a fun action film that I could enjoy on a Friday night. The performances in the film are good, and so are the visuals. The dialogue and the story aren't as good as they could have been, and that was slightly disappointing, so that keeps this from being a great film noir cop movie. However, in an age where video game movies can't even get the basics right, and are basically God awful, this can claim to be one of the better video game adaptations. This film is flawed, but if you don't try to compare it to the game it can be an enjoyable watch.7/10",Max Payne
71,dvc5159,"Visually stunning, almost everything else average. Don't expect another ""Shooter"".",6,16 October 2008,"Another year, another film adaptation of a video-game. I walked in the cinema with very low expectations, but surprisingly I walked out satisfied, if not groaning. Max Payne, while still not reaching the artistic heights that video-game movies have yet to achieve, is a decent potboiler and a good way to waste one and a half hours of your time.Marky Mark is watchable as Payne. Here, the filmmakers decided to focus on characterization more than the game itself, making the film more noir-ish than stylized. Still trying to bulk up his action hero resume, here Wahlberg somehow slightly drags along for the ride, though in some scenes his acting is good. But definitely a step down after the great ""Shooter"".The action sequences are well-shot. They satisfy any action fan's hunger. The angelic/demonic hallucinations during action scenes are pivotal, and are arguably the best things in the film. Beautiful in an artistic sense, yet strangely what is something this artistic doing in a supposedly mindless action film? Nevertheless the film's look and atmosphere are nicely done, as per the music score by Marco Beltrami. And let's not forget Bond girl Olga Kurylenko, sex bomb... I mean, eye candy of the year.My only complaint goes to four things:First, the script. Why is there some cringe-inducing lines in the film? It makes a tough film cheesy. Really.Second, the wasted use of actors. Some surprising faces here (Chris O'Donell, Beau Bridges, Olga Kurylenko) but they are used gimmicky. You'll see as the film progresses.Thirdly, the pace. It starts of interestingly, but after that the pace trods along slowly like a snail, diverting my patience and attention. Thankfully after the middle of the film the pace went back on track.Lastly, the film is supposed to be an R-Rated, violent, mean spirited film and as gritty as the original games were. Why would John Moore ask the editor to trim the movie down to a mere PG-13? A teenager would not go in anyway as the film is obviously meant for mature audiences only, so what's the point in trimming? It would just anger the fans and will do harm to the movie overall. Obviously, the word ""greedy"" comes to mind. But this time it's not the executives at Fox's fault. It's the director's.That being said, however, the violence is definitely a hard PG-13 in the reign of the Bourne movies and Die Hard 4.Overall, decent. If you think this show kicks ass, you have not been seeing many better action movies in your lifetime. However if you are in the ""Wahlberg Kicks Ass"" club, gladly oblige to see the movie.Entertainment value: 7.1/10Overall value: 5.6/10Delton",Max Payne
72,jhpstrydom,Without being compared to the game.,6,9 March 2009,"Mark Wahlberg plays popular game hero Max Payne, a cop who sets out to find the man who killed his wife and child, while doing so he uncovers a potential conspiracy that could lead him to the killer.While Max Payne boasts a great tone, atmosphere and great cinematography, the overall film wasn't really all that great, the acting was tough to judge, there were some good performances but the actors seem like they didn't have much to work with, the action scenes are minimal, and was just a ton of shooting and they weren't all that exciting, however if you are interested in this film, you can watch it, but I feel that there are better options.Without comparing it to the game, I felt they could have done more to make it a bit more interesting and exciting, and possibly add more to Max Payne's back story and they could've been more inventive with the action scenes instead of making people just shoot at each other.Otherwise, its a good concept and is well shot, but the execution needed a little more work.",Max Payne
73,eddax,Movies based on video games should be more interesting than this,3,13 January 2010,"*yawn* Movies based on video games should be more interesting than this. Max Payne comes across as any other crime movie - a cop whose family is murdered goes against the police force in his relentless pursuit of the culprits and eventually unearths a big conspiracy involving illicit drugs. It's the sort of movie I wouldn't have bothered watching, actually, had I actually read the movie's synopsis first. The cast is unexceptional apart from the occasion surprise of a big name in a small role, like Chris O'Donnell and Nelly Furtado. They're actually good but they're barely on screen but for a couple of minutes. The direction is reminiscent of Sin City but with color. It's not a compliment, since it makes me think ""rip-off"" instead of ""homage."" Perhaps the director didn't mean to, as the style is apropos for this movie as well, but still.",Max Payne

However something I never do that alot people do and I don't understand it. Is they base movie adaptations of the source material and if something strays at all they automatically pan it.
Myself I like to go into something with open mind and if anything appreciate some different changes directors make to the story.With that said Max Payne the movie is thrilling neo noir action ride that keeps you at edge of your seat. I felt all the actors in the film did pretty good job with the material. There was action throughout that I also found entertaining and the pacing was good as well. The only achilles heel I felt with this film had to do with the hero/villain fights. Without giving to much away I just thought those scenes would be way more intense then they actually were and it kind of killed alot of the buildup in my opinion.Other then that don't listen to reviewers and give this movie try its very entertaining in my opinion.",Max Payne
75,squirrel_burst,Dull. And the people in charge of releasing this picture knew it too!,2,4 March 2015,"Just when you thought video game movies couldn't get even worse, here comes the pain! ""Max Payne"" that is. It's a dull, clichéd detective story that masquerades as a supernatural film in order to sucker you in. The story follows Max Payne, a detective who had a loving wife and family, but lost it all one night when intruders came into his house and murdered them while he was away at work. Ten minutes earlier and he could have saved them so of course, he has become a shadow of his former self, only dealing with cold cases and generally walking around brooding. When a girl who unsuccessfully tries to seduce him turns up dead, he is suspected of being the killer and is forced to go on the run. The killer, or killers appear to be connected to a narcotic drug ""Valkyr"", who in turn appears to be connected to his wife. Was it all a senseless murder after all, or a big conspiracy? It's up to this super sleuth to figure it out, along with the sister of the dead girl, Mona (Mila Kunis).This really feels like a dusty old detective story script that was re-purposed to be a video game movie. The plot, concerning Mark Walhberg, walking around the crime-ridden streets brooding constantly is a tremendous bore. Suspect number 1 for this crime is the director, who makes none of the characters remotely interesting. Max Payne is about as emotionally responsive as a T-800, except constantly depressed. During the whole film he doesn't crack a single smile and always appears on the verge of tears. He's not even interested in Olga Kurylenko (who was in another bad video game movie I saw, ""Hitman""). She strips down, completely naked and tries to seduce him. He looks at her like she's a blank wall. He doesn't even get excited when he's gunning down the bad guys or running away from danger. Even getting shot in the arm barely gets a rouse out of Max so you cannot connect with this character, no matter how tragic his back story is. Mila Kunis doesn't fare much better. Her character is basically just angry at the fact that her sister was murdered. That's it. She tags along with Max Payne, sometimes. Mostly she just disappears from the movie. Our villains are completely bland as well. Amaury Nolasco plays a 'roided up assassin that is really just a generic serial killer. Believe me, even that sentence makes it sound more interesting than it actually is. Even the overall mystery of who killed Max Payne's wife and child is really easy to figure out from the get-go (due to the overuse of logos on the victims and items related to the case) and once you do figure it out, you're checking your watch hoping the running time is almost over. No such luck.""But wait a minute!"" you might be saying ""I saw the trailer for this movie and it looked really cool! There were these creepy angels flying around, rooftops exploding into scenes taken straight out of hell, and I even saw a clip where the people investigating a murder said that the wounds couldn't have been caused by anything human!"" To you, I'm sorry to say that you have been terribly misled. You see; someone at the head of the studio watched this movie and realized how boring it all was. They knew that none of the characters would entice you in the least to check it out, so they threw in a bunch of clips of the characters on drugs having hallucinations. To clarify, whenever people use the Valkyr drug, they start having these visions of angels and of hell. At first, you don't know this but it becomes obvious that every scene where you hear fluttering wings or shadows over a character that is screaming or running away in panic is just a bunch of hallucinations. The film teases with the idea that the drug actually causes people to see invisible creatures and that the murders are being causes by these angelic beings, but it is not the case. The wounds that ""couldn't have been caused by a human"" are, in fact caused by a human and there are no hidden mystical creatures in this movie.At least with some bad video game movies, like ""Resident Evil"", ""Super Mario Brothers"" or even ""Bloodrayne"" the movie sucks, but there are some interesting action scenes and maybe a couple of cool creatures or interesting monsters to make the time pass by. It really isn't the case here. Yeah there are some shootouts, but the climactic battles are about as interesting as your average bed pillow and I struggle to call a bunch of hallucinations ""cool creatures"". They could have been edited out of the movie completely and not affected the plot in the least.Everything about this movie screams ""bad direction"", particularly considering the stars, which have proved themselves to be competent actors before. You can do so much better than ""Max Payne"", which by the way, sets itself up for a sequel at the end of the credits (a sequel that thankfully will never come to pass). Just don't watch it. It sucks, it's even worse than you've heard. (On DVD, April 25, 2014)",Max Payne
76,Quebec_Dragon,Almost painful,4,6 August 2009,"I played the 2 games to completion and loved them. This movie, whether you're a fan of the games or not, is plain boring. As a film noir, it's neither truly atmospheric nor gloomy. Yes, it ""snows"" constantly (although the snow didn't look real to me) or it rains but that's not enough. As a revenge film, it doesn't involve you nor does it make you feel the anger of the protagonist or the guilty satisfaction of the guilty being punished. Actually, the reason for the revenge is not properly shown until the middle. The movie should have started with this! As an action flick, it's neither exciting nor thrilling. I was actually bored and the movie felt much longer than its running time. The Max Payne games are famous for using an effect called bullet time (think the slow motion parts in Matrix or Wanted). It looks very cool and if they had used it more than a couple of times in the film, it would have made the action so much better.In the games, Max Payne was also the narrator. He tended to sometimes go into bad poetry but there were some very good lines and it gave us a great insight into the mind of the character as well as helping tremendously the film noir aspect. The film would have sorely needed this elsewhere than at the very start. Not just for storytelling purposes but because Mark Wahlberg playing Max Payne was mostly stiff as a board and totally uncharismatic and uncool. None of the other characters particularly fared well especially Mona Sax. Beau Bridges, as a security chief, did add a touch of class. To go back on the action, what little there is, was mostly underwhelming and yawn-inducing.There was an original somewhat supernatural element added (see the dark wings in the trailer) not present in the games that serves up some nifty visuals but I'm not sure it was necessary. It can be jarring and might make you believe it's more fantastical than it actually is. For those interested, Max Payne the film is like a shell of the games: sprinkling in a couple character names, constant fake snow, the drug Valkyr (looking and acting different) and one of the location's names. Max Payne should have and could have been a stylish exciting modern film noir if the Hollywood hacks doing this had simply sticked closer to the game. I could say this is a disappointment but by now we have learned not to expect too much from video game adaptations.Rating: 3.5 out of 10.",Max Payne
77,undeaddt,"Try not to see it like a game based movie, but as a action movie.",7,25 October 2018,"If you try and not see this movie as a movie that was based on one of the best gaming franchises in the 21 century, it is a good action movie, but otherwise, if you see it as a film that needs to channel the greatness of the games to the movie theaters, it is awful. I think that Mark Wahlberg was the real guy to be chosen for the role of Max Payne and he does his job perfectly, he is by far one of the most adaptable actors in this decade. I also fell in love with the way the city looked, I see a lot of Gotham in it and the way things are set it reminds me a lot of Sin City, which I also liked a lot. Other than that, the action scenes are few and they are nothing special to be talked about, the acting crew is great with a lot of famous faces, but still they did not manage to change the fact that the movie flopped as a game based one.",Max Payne
78,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"A die hard fan is pleased, and here's why.",8,16 October 2008,"Oh, my dreams have sort of come true. Max Payne, on film. I had prayed for months that it wouldn't stink to the high heavens like every other video game adaptation. Thankfully, Max Payne does not stink as a standalone film or adaptation, nor is it anything like the other game adaptations. John Moore's obvious goal in the film was to match the spirit, tone, and grit of the game, and I have to say that he reached it.While I was disappointed in the lack of action sequences, I think that including even half of the action from the game would have taken away from the realism of the film, as mountains of action sequences work a lot better in a game than they do on film. The film opts for a quieter tone, and a much more thoughtful and introspective approach. I appreciated this a lot, as a fan of the game. By no means is Max Payne just thrown together to make a quick buck. It is well made, and well thought out. I was not disappointed in this aspect.Mark Wahlberg, thank you for not failing. That would have ruined my year. Wahlberg delivers a quiet, yet subtle and intense performance in the title role as the most ""pain"" and ""pun"" inducing detective of all time. While there is a large supporting cast, I really wasn't swayed either way by any of them, besides Chris Bridges, who was actually playing a character for once instead of himself on screen. Mila Kunis as Mona Sax wasn't the best casting in the world, but Mila proves that it wasn't the worst casting either. There isn't as much depth to her in the film as there was in the game.As an adaptation, the Max Payne film is very different from the game in pretty much every aspect besides the tone and the characterizations. Once again, all I wanted was the tone to be right, and I got what I wanted. Though the noir aspect of the game is somewhat lacking (I missed Max's inner monologue so much), I still found it to be the dark and effective thriller that the game was. A brooding performance from Wahlberg and a matching score only add to the film. Stunning visuals, engineered by the fictional hallucinogenic drug in the film, in addition to the dark cinematography, steal attention away from the fact that the film's editing is subpar.I have to bring to life the fact that Max Payne is not an action movie at heart. It is a mystery film with some action scenes (and some very well done visual effects). The game may have been a shoot 'em up style game, but I know that you can't do this on film and expect to be taken seriously, which Max Payne should be.At it's core, Max Payne, despite a lot of changes from the game, remains the dark, story driven thriller that I've loved for a good part of my life. I'm proud of the film as a die hard fan of the game, and respect it for what it is as a film by itself. I'm satisfied, and not disappointed. For those who haven't played the game, Max Payne is an effective mystery film that is driven by the main character and the exposition around him. For those who will inevitably complain about a lack of action sequences, wake up and realize that Moore & company got the tone right, at the expense of necessary cuts.",Max Payne
79,TheHande,"A great looking and sounding movie, with a mediocre plot",6,19 October 2008,"Max Payne is an interesting film from a production-values point of view, but it unfortunately seems to fail, at least partly, in what it obviously set out to do. What the movie attempts to be is a serious video-game movie, but what it turns out to be is a film where the story is just way too predictable.Audio-visually the film is great. Marco Beltrami (Resident Evil, Silent Hill) does his usual excellent job on the score of the movie. Visually the film is powerful, whether they depict it snowing or raining the film just looks wonderful. The few actions scenes are also done with class, but the movie is actually driven more by the story. Unfortunately, since the story isn't all that compelling it means the movie begins to drag on and becomes kinda depressing and later a little boring.In all the movie lacks anything that would raise your interest. The CGI work with the Valkyries undoubtedly looks amazing but doesn't really add anything to the film. Another problem is that the film tries to be so serious and dark. There are some moments of levity but they are few and far between and because of this it feels like the film kinda drags on.For fans of action movies Max Payne is definitely a passable film, but it lacks the character that would make it stand out amongst the video game movies of recent years. Silent Hill had the visuals and a great story. Hit-man had hard-hitting, gritty action but with a bit of a comic tint to keep the film interesting. And even Dead Or Alive managed to stand out thanks to its comical touch. Max Payne just doesn't offer anything that you wouldn't find in any other action movie.",Max Payne
80,gregeichelberger,'Max Payne' is an accurate description,4,28 October 2008,"If one was to go by Mark Wahlberg's recent film history, one would say the young actor is making great strides in the realm of filmcraft. One would also have to have him step back a few notches, however, after starring in the newest action misadventure, ""Max Payne."" Based on a once-popular video game (that's a bad first sign, considering some of the movies coming from this genre include ""Alone in the Dark,"" ""Silent Hill,"" ""Doom,"" ""Underground Evolution,"" ""Street Fighter,"" ""Mortal Kombat"" and, of course, the horrid ""Super Mario Brothers""), this has Wahlberg as the brooding, morose, depressing title character.I guess he should be sad, though. He is a New York City Police detective whose wife and baby son are murdered. When no one on the force can solve the crime, he becomes resentful and withdraws to the cold case division.When his former partner and a prostitute he bumped into once end up dead, however, he is the natural suspect and is soon on the lam.Max, though, is not as stupid as he appears, and somehow uncovers a conspiracy concerning a drug company's effort to make a serum which causes soldiers not to fear combat.Only one percent of the subjects have their fright eliminated, though, as the other 99 percent suffer severe hallucinations, including experiencing visions of Valkries (or large winged demons of Norse mythology) before killing themselves. The drug, by the way, is called ""Valkare"" just to rub the irony in in our faces a bit more.Meanwhile, Payne discovers that his wife's murder may not have been a random act and even his closest confidants might know more than they are admitting.All pretty confusing stuff. Not only that, but it is extremely dark (not just the story, but the joyless cinematography; it's either raining, snowing or it's nighttime) and terribly loud, to boot.And while Wahlberg does the best he can with his character's limited development, others in the film, including Beau Bridges, Mila Kunis (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" the voice of Meg on ""Family Guy""), Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Chris O'Donnell, among others, are absolutely abysmal.I could certainly tolerate these flaws to a point, but add to it that the movie has little or no excitement despite constantly delving into the supernatural and you have one mish-mash of a film.Better to save one's money and rent the original game, or even some of Wahlberg's other pictures, such as ""Invincible,"" ""Shooter"" ""Perfect Storm"" or ""The Departed.""",Max Payne
81,shadowman123,"No Sin City , But still worth a look at.",6,4 November 2008,"I am huge fan of the computer game series , Max Payne on his own seems like a very interesting character however although Mark Wahlberg touches on that, he never truly goes all the way and shows what the character is all about. Although computer game-to-movie adaptionations do sick with the expection of lets say Tomb Raider or maybe Silent Hill, Max Payne does seem half decent. The scenery and the mood is set in a great way , also the clever use of visuals make it all the film-noir Sin City style. The problems however with Max Payne are that which most of these types of movies suffer from. The script is shallow and in a way it seems to do the character no justice what so ever, Although Mark Walhberg made an effort it seems that there is very little preparation needed for his character because it looks like that he so used to playing 'tough guys'. However it is not a total dud , as the atmosphere and great action scenes save it from being a complete waste. To conclude Max Payne should of been a terrific movie and by checking out there is no denying that it has lots of potential but is unfortunately hampered by time old problems. Its not a total waste of time but , worth a look at but don't expect anything big.MAX PAYNE - 6.7 OUT OF 10",Max Payne

If I would make a movie based on action video game, I would not only try to keep a game atmosphere in it, I would put as much as possible action in it. The plot was so many time used in other action movies that it gave me a headache. Altought there was some originality in it, like that Viking thing.

84,GirishGowda,"Verdict from a non-fan, this was a Major Pain",4,2 May 2010,"As everybody said Max Payne was a major pain in the butt when it releases a couple of years back, I didn't go to the theatres to see it. Last night, it was coming on TV and I thought, hey let me give it a try and sat down to watch it. The concept wasn't too bad, but the execution is very shoddy and amateurish.Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a New York City police detective and he is haunted by the murder of his wife and baby's death even after three years. He killed two of the murderers, but couldn't kill the last one. He is a tortured soul who wants nothing more than hunting down the last murderer. During one of his routines to gather new leads and information about his family's murderer, he befriends Natasha Sax (Olga Kurylenko) who is murdered and her sister, Mona Sax (Mila Kunis) wants revenge. Jack Lupino (Amaury Nolasco) is her murderer and both Payne and Mona team up to get their revenge. But, is Lupino the real antagonist or is there someone operating behind the curtain? First of all the cinematography is excellent - I loved the feel of the movie, the score is not overbearing. But what really is a drag, is that there is nothing in the story that drags the viewer in. The starting of the movie kind of captured my attention, but by the 30th minute, it was getting boring. Mark Wahlberg only has one expression in his face throughout the movie and it is a major pain in the ass when he portrays the same expression when he is happy with his family too. That is kind of confusing, wasn't he happy with his family when they were alive or what? Bad casting choice there and the writer seems to have no job here, as there are hardly any dialogues and whatever there is seems to be drowned out by Mr. Major Pain. Olga Kurylenko - why does so many of you think she is sexy again? She can act (Quantum Of Solace), but she isn't sexy (they should have roped in Megan Fox, now that is one hot babe) and she plays only a cameo which didn't add anything to the story. Amaury Nolasco (Prison Break) as the bald Lupino who is high on drugs, looks and acts credibly, but there is not enough scope for his acting ability. Mila Kunis is also wasted. Why were there huge man-crows (or 'angels' like they call them) flying through the skies of NYC in the minds of people? I only got it, when they showed that all of them were druggies. This film seems to be telling us not to get addicted to drugs, we get it. Move on, will you? I don't do drugs (I am a 20 year old guy) and nor will anyone else who knows what drugs can really do. The slow motion scenes were good, but there was only a couple of them and the dark angels were very cool.Though the film was somewhat boring, I can't give it a 1, because the visual treatment was excellent and I like some of Mr. Wahlberg's previous works. By the looks of it, there seems to be a sequel coming which I definitely won't be watching if the reviews are the same as this. Don't watch this at any cost, unless you are a teenage boy and get real high seeing girl-on-girl kiss.4/10",Max Payne
85,helmutty,A review by someone who did not play the game.,7,18 October 2008,"First of all, I did not play the game-Max Payne. How did I know this movie? There are trailers and I am interested in movies adapted from games. I have almost seen all the movies adaptations of games like Hit-man and resident evil. Coming to the review, Max Payne is an interesting story but there is lack of action and lack of slow-motion gun shooting. I am interested throughout and I am no idea what to be bored about. The effects are cool, music is cool and gun-shoot outs are interesting too although I agree that they are a little disappointing.The story: Max Payne is a depressed cop who is trying to find the killer who murdered his wife. When time passes, he finally finds some clues and they will lead to the one who killed his wife. Story sounds simple but the emotions and the tone are the point. Along, you will get some short action scenes which will lead to the final shoot-out. I did not play the game but I enjoy the movie. Those who say that only gamers will enjoy the movie, they are wrong. Some gamers hate the movie and some strangers to the game enjoy the movie.Overall: It is good for time passing. Those who want big-bang action and non-stop thrilling action with non-stop shoot-outs, this one may disappoint. Those who want time-passer, this may pipe some interest. It is not bad and could improve on the action/shoot-outs scenes. Wait for cast and credits to roll off and discover something.",Max Payne
86,mr_popcorn,Max Payne,5,15 October 2008,"Lincoln DeNeuf: ""The Devil is building his army. Max Payne is looking for something that God wants to stay hidden. That is what makes him more dangerous.""Rockstar Games' double-gunned action franchise comes to the big screen thanks to director John Moore (The Omen) and Mark Wahlberg, who embodies the title character of Max Payne, a widowed cop hell-bent on delivering justice no matter what the cost as he investigates a string of killings in his city. Mila Kunis and Chris O'Donnell head up the supporting cast, with Beau Thorne adapting the screenplay for the 20th Century Fox production. Review After a long wait, I finally got to see this just a while ago in theaters. After seeing the kick ass trailer, my hopes were riding high thinking that the video game to movie genre might have just found its best film ever. I hate to break it to you but it isn't. But its not that bad actually, its just something's missing, the key ingredient for a perfect video game to movie translation. Oh well, it seems like Silent Hill still holds the top spot as the best video game movie ever. Director John Moore, the guy who made Owen Wilson into a bulletproof God in Behind Enemy Lines, just missed the spot by an inch. True, he captured the essence of the game, kudos to excellent production design, John Moore stayed true to the game with the over usage of snow and the rain fall almost taking the shape of a new character and the cold weather is present at every pivotal scene in the movie. Kind of like a metaphor of Max Payne's revenge fit to those who killed his family: sad, agonizing and stone cold. Mark Wahlberg in his most physically demanding role ever as titular hero Max gives his best as he almost carried the whole movie in his shoulders. The mishandled Mila Kunis gets limited screen time as assassin Mona Sax, a bad move for the director as I can already envision throngs of angry Max Payne die hards rallying outside screaming for John Moore's head for butchering their beloved action heroine. Besides the eye candy slow motion and the raining bullet orgy happening in the movie, it left some unanswered plot points and that's what you get if your concern is action first and story development second. The poorly executed ending concluded abruptly and I wanted more out of it. I am assuming this will be a hit in the box office and with huge box office returns means a potential sequel. Spin the story a little bit more and prioritize plot development and maybe I'll give it another shot.",Max Payne

Well, at least I learn that in US, a good cop on drug is still a good cop, despite all the hallucinations he sees and all the dead bodies he left...To make it simple, I am a huge fan of the original Max Payne game. Back to 2001, the game totally blew me away with everything it offers. So at least, I was anticipating a movie that matches the game's reputation. But I was essentially disappointed by it.What I think were wrong about the movie: 1, casting. There were so many wonderful characters in the original. Each one had their memorable moments. In the movie you really can't match them with actors one by one.All there left are familiar names. Mona Sax should be sexy and deceitful, but here she's just......I had bad feelings about it when they cast Mark Whalberg for the main protagonist, Max Payne. He might be a good choice for ""Shooter"". But IMO, Max Payne has more to offer than double-handed guns and a big frown. In the original game, Max was such a bitter and dark-toned person that he even always had a sarcastic smile when he was doing his job. ""What does 'BB' mean? Backstabbing Bastard?"" This is an example of how detective Payne talks to a suspect. Plus, he is at the same time the narrator, who brings players insights into the NYC underworld. In the game, we could feel Max growing on us, as his character become more and more multi-dimensional. We learned of his pain after the American dream being ultimately marred. He blames himself, suspect his own motivations of all the revenge and bloodshed. That's why he was so alive on the little screen and people could really taste his nightmare. However on the big screen, all he left for Mark Whalberg are guns and the coat.2, the story. Max Payne is one of those games that the story really matter. From time to time you'd have to seriously think about the dialogs to get the underlying messages. But the movie was so straight forward in visualizing everything, especially the mysterious drug Valkyrie and its effects. It was effective in luring people into cinemas for another ""Constantine"", but not effective in making the story deep. So, just like the casting and performance, they abandoned most of good things and made it an MTV.3, The actions. If Max Payne, to audiences, just means two guns and a big shaggy coat, at least the actions should be satisfying. However, I was wrong again. The bullet-time were there, but all in wrong places. When he was desperately outnumbered by enemies in the climax, all we saw was Mark Whalberg's face-on-drug. The actions were never in sequences, never fluent and never enough to make a wonderful scene. I can't figure out what was the director afraid of making a complete action scene. Maybe he just didn't quite got the idea of the game.I gave it a 6/10, because of all the good things about the movie brought up by other reviews. I have also noticed them and I gave credits to the cinematographic and the abuse of black and red. But believe me, THIS IS NOT MAX PAYNE.",Max Payne
89,bayardhiler,Hear Mark Wahlberg Roar!!!!!!!!....And Laugh Out Loud,3,15 February 2014,"Where to begin? 2008's ""Max Payne"" is one of those films that really had the potential to be a cool movie. After all the premise of someone looking for vengeance in a dark world has made an excellent plot for more than one movie (""The Crow"" anyone?). But when the plot and over all film is so meddled by someone incompetent like John Moore (the man who killed ""Die Hard""!) well, then it becomes a nightmare. Based off the popular video game, it stars Mark Wahlberg in the title role as a detective who works the cold case desk by day and hunts for the people who killed his wife and baby by night. But when mysterious and brutal murders start occurring, that's when things go down hill fast and not in a good way. You see, the filmmakers decided it would be cool to have fake-looking flying black CGI demons seen from the people's point of view before getting killed. You might think that means some sort of supernatural force at work but in the end, without giving too much away, it's all for show and nothing else. Now as far as Wahlberg's performance goes, he actually does get into the role completely. Unfortunately though, the plot doesn't inspire us to care all that much of what happens. If I had to guess why that is, it would probably be due to the fact that the plot is handled poorly by Moore, almost to the point that you really don't care all that much what happens. Even when the ravishing Mila Kunis is included as some sort of Russian gangster trying to find the murderer of her sister, things don't really improve all that well. Add in the lousy effects and far-fetched scenes (like when Payne manages to dodge who knows how many bullets from twenty machine guns being fired at him while running down a hall!) it becomes nothing short of a laugh riot. One of the few good things that I can say for the movie is that it does have a good dark look to it. With the constant snow coming down, New York becomes a rather gloomy place to be in. But then Mark Wahlberg does his roar (trust me, you'll know it when you see it) and when that happens, just try with all your might not to laugh. I guarantee you won't be able to hold back. With all that said, if you need something for a bad movie night with friends, ""Max Payne"" is probably a top choice. Also starring Beau Bridges, Ludicrous, and Chris O'Donnell.",Max Payne
90,kevin_crighton,Another game adaptation that doesn't work.,3,15 November 2008,"Max Payne is the latest movie to be made, based on a computer game. And while not the worst of them, it's still a major disappointment.I'm not even going to try and give a plot synopsis, as simply put it is all over the place. Suffice it to say, there is something about a drug to help soldiers over-come fear, the murder of a girl and his old partner, some supernatural creatures (maybe) and the death of Max's wife and child years before.As I said, the plot is all over the place. What doesn't help is that characters do things that are at odds with what happened the scene before! One moment, a character is helping Max, then next trying to have him killed.As a character, Max doesn't really work. There is nothing likable about him at all. Okay, he is after revenge for his family being killed, but there is no humour in him, he doesn't give sympathetic ear to anyone trying to help him. As a result, you simply don't care what happens to him. I don't blame Mark Wahlberg's performance. I think it's simply the way the character is written that is the fault.The rest of the cast (including the new bond girl Olga Kurylenko in a small role) don't really register. It doesn't help, as I said that the characters' motivation seems to change from scene to scene.John Moore, who directed the remakes of Flight Of The Phoenix (which I enjoyed), and The Omen (which I didn't) does stage some okay action sequences, and creates some impressive visual sequences, but the story and script don't really help him.I've never played the game. But from what I understand, the plot used here is not the same as the game. It does mean you have to ask, why make a movie based on a game, if you aren't going to use the plot from one? As a game, it may work very well. As a movie however, Max Payne is a disappointment.",Max Payne

92,Simon_Says_Movies,Takes itself much too seriously and lacks action,4,20 October 2008,"It seems that a rule of thumb exists when examining certain genres of movies which seem to inexplicably and infinitely churn out low calibre products. While by no means am I making unfair generalizations as exceptions always exist, the aforementioned dreck seems to reside within three cliques of the movie industry. The first, not surprisingly, are remakes which recently populate yearly release schedules like bunnies. The second, and again as I'm sure you could have surmised are sequels and are akin to the former. The last of this Bermuda Triangle of sub-par cinema are adaptations derived from less then conventional sources; toys, songs, old television programs, attractions and last but not least (well, actually least) video games.Despite a cornucopia of inspiration at their disposal, the (less then) creative minds if Hollywood cannot seem to give rise to anything particularly memorable. Now that is not to say nothing watchable has emerged from this sub-genre, as I enjoyed the Resident Evil series on a strictly B movie level, but there is most certainly room for improvement. This time round we have the adaptation of the long running franchise, Max Payne. I personally have never played this game, but even I can deduce that something must have been lost in translation, or I would otherwise be forced to make large scale generalizations about its fan base. In director John Moore's imagining mostly everything is taken much too seriously, especially when boasting a storyline about drug-induced hallucinations involving winged demons. Mark Wahlberg's Max Payne might as well have worn a mask, as the only thing that moves on his hardened face is his mouth when he talks. And in its attempt to be stylish, the art direction (although stylish) is much to bleak to be involving.A more tortured man you are not likely to find. DEA Agent Max Payne's (Wahlberg) life has been unrelentingly consumed as he searches for the man who took his family away. During a robbery gone wrong, Payne's wife and infant son are murdered by three assailants, the third of which escaped his vengeful clutches. Sifting through endless case files and dead-end leads, hope finally glimmers after the brutal murder of sexy Natasha (future Bond girl Olga Kurylenko) whom Payne had a brief encounter with. Bearing the same tattoo as one of the slain perpetrators, Payne's ex-partner (Donal Logue) leads the hardened cop into a cult-like underground drug scene which gives its users terrifying hallucinations, where he joins forces with Natasha's assassin sister Mona Sax. (played by the vivacious and always sultry Mila Kunis) Together, and with the secret aid of Max's father's old partner BB Hensley (Beau Bridges) whom now works at the corporation formerly employing his lost love they try to find out for good what happened to his family. Throwing a kink in Max's plans is the death of his ex-partner, which, coupled with his connection to Natasha puts him under investigation by Det. Jim Bravura (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) for the killings.I have sifted through a number of opinions which feel that Max Payne falls victim to its action. I on the other hand feel the opposite. That the scenes are far and in between the monotonous dialogue and introduction of irrelevant supporting characters. Such an example is a drug user who thinks he is a god and offers nothing but to give Max a faceless adversary. While watching the narrative unfold, I was continuously confused, as most characters were not properly introduced, story lines meandered and the integration of the demons was overdone. Certain scenes were outright laughable, and my theatre and friends seemed to share my view. And the ""twist"" I found to be quite obvious, and the following scenes were laughably dubious and clichéd. Other then the fact that its hero can endure shotgun, pistol and machine gun rounds, hypothermia and beatings over the course of the film nothing else miraculous occurs, and resides a bar under disposable entertainment, despite (sadly) being one of the more successful game-to-screen adaptations yet. With its dawdling storyline, a distinct vibe of style-over-substance and cringe worthy segments, this fall release adequately disproves the adage, ""no Payne, no gain"".View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",Max Payne

95,frankenbenz,The title of this movie perfectly describes the movie-going experience...,3,6 December 2008,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/Certain actors on a marquee will give you a good idea what type of movie you're going to see: English actors = period pieces, theater actors = serious drama, former sports stars = brainless action movies. Obviously these are sweeping generalizations, but a marquee can still give you a pretty good idea what you're getting yourself into. So if you see Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and Ludicrous lumped together, you should probably expect the worst. Max Payne delivers on that promise. If the bad acting, pointlessly excessive action sequences and the suffocatingly tireless soundtrack don't make you beg for this mess to end, the well worn, boringly familiar plot will.Fans of the Max Payne video game will also be disappointed. The game was a nightmarish noir with surprisingly rich characters and an addictive storyline. The movie does no justice to the game and keeps very little of the plot intact, save for the titular character's tragic past. Wahlberg, as always, is wooden and gives Payne none of the tortured angst and cryptic depth he deserves. Mila Kunis is just awful, proving that great looks do not always deserve to be seen. Watching Kunis is the equivalent of watching someone else's child play dress up in a school play. Rapper turned actor Chris Ludicrous Bridges also feels like he's costumed to play a part he has no ability to play - is it not obvious to Casting Director's this guy has less acting range than even the other rapper turned actor in this movie? You wonder if the execs behind these casting decisions really are so cynical that they believe no matter how talentless their hires are, they will attract their sought after demographic. If box-office is any indicator, these 18- 25 year olds aren't as stupid as the Fox executives wish they were. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this big budget spectacle of sh** because if I had, then I'd be really mad.",Max Payne
96,Vincent_B,A poor movie that loses on two fronts.,4,5 February 2009,"Max Payne is billed as a movie based on a popular action video game. However the movie fails to satisfy the people who played the game by not following the game. Some of the names are there but that is where the similarity ends. The movie fails as a stand alone for people going to see an action movie about a cop on the edge. This film lacks action and attempts some cheesy drug induced hallucinations that fail to keep the audience spellbound. I actually replayed the game after watching the movie and they didn't even make it halfway through the first game. Was the writer hoping to make this into a trilogy? I don't know, but like I said there is very little about this movie that maintains the game's plot, style, or action.I kind of figured this movie was going to be a turkey when I found out it was only rated PG-13. If they had stuck to the game's plot and done it justice it would have been rated R. People still watch rated R movies but lately Hollywood has been cranking out a lot of movies directed at the ""teen"" market. This game has been around long enough that most of the players are over 18 years old. So I rented this turd fest on DVD and sadly it didn't surprise me in the least. If you didn't like the movie play the game it is much better.",Max Payne
97,robertallenandersonjr,Starts out slow but last half kicks it up,7,17 October 2008,Max Payne was a very slow moving movie for the first part of the movie. The reason why it was slow though is because it was explaining the story of the movie. The story was very good and kept going with it all the way until the very end. The last half of the movie really kicks it up and has a ton of action. I liked all of the special and visual effects. Their were many slow motion scenes that made the movie cool. The visuals were very good and many of them were shots of tall long buildings. Mark Whalberg was very good and did a stellar job as Max Payne. Mila Kunis was good as well for the amount of screen time she gets. The movie had many great fun action scenes to watch. The movie in ways was kind of sad. They had many flashbacks throughout the movie. Overall the movie does lack and flaw a lot of things but its pretty good.,Max Payne
98,Adorable,"No longer a heyday classic, but still fun",6,23 January 2009,"The first Max Payne game, when I picked it up for the PC back in late summer 2001, was a singular experience. That thing kept me enthralled for almost a week  I basically recall going to work, eating, and playing Max Payne.The story, the mood, the action  all were marvelously conceived and effortlessly executed. Then came Max Payne 2, which was supposed to be much the same, but the magic was gone. And now we have Max Payne, the movie, on home video. Here, as in the sequel, the mysterious sway the original title held over gamers and action fiends is almost entirely absent.Let there be no misunderstanding, Max Payne isn't a bad motion picture. It's quite watchable and only has a few yawnsome stretches, but it's nowhere nearly as compelling as its source material.As goes for most movies based on games, a combination of the inspiration being ill-suited to other formats and the filmmakers' ever-present fears that ""normal"", non-gamer audiences won't get it conspire to knock this release back a few notches. Once again the action has become subdued, central story tenets dropped, and characters erased.This Max Payne has Mark Wahlberg render the game protagonist as a more hapless, almost bureaucratic persona, and although he does that adequately, this isn't the noir enigma the first iteration was. And while Max Payne started out fictional life as an almost psychotic rogue NYPD detective, Wahlberg puts forth someone laden with grief and despair  not a sadistic, Punisher-like desire to avenge himself against the criminal element.Speaking of elements, the movie glosses over or outright ignores many components from the game's cool story, such as the vital mafia aspect and shadowy Inner Circle. Instead, we have a plot that follows a familiar arc. Cop wronged by nefarious interests, goes a bit off kilter, finds renewed passion for correcting said wrongs, then kicks some ass. Only some though, this isn't the most gung ho movie ever released, although there are several respectable action setpieces. Only a few, mind, and the game's super-addictive bullet time likewise gets a simple, after a fashion nod, that's it.Conversely, the supernatural was merely a backdrop in the game version, but here it's taken to a slight extreme. This doesn't hurt, but nor does it help avert attention from the fact that the movie's version of New York isn't as detached and comic-bookish as the game's.However, they did get the snow almost right (the game was set during a strangely long, seemingly endless blizzard), and many of the original characters actually end up more interesting than in the game  to wit Ludicrous as Lt. Jim Bravura and Mila Kunis as assassin Mona Sax. We also get Amaury Nolasco portraying Jack Lupino, a character most gamers would say wasn't all that essential to proceedings in the original, but don't quote me on that. In the movie he's almost the chief antagonist, which doesn't sit right.Either way, Max Payne won't bore you, it's OK as an action movie and the dark, snowy mood helps it as a cold season release. It's quite apparent they didn't really film in New York, but the CGI isn't too obvious or cheesy.Director John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines) manages to supervise a good looking affair here, and while gamers won't get to relive the chaotic, often tragic but nonetheless memorable days of summer-fall 2001 through this film, it's still a relatively competent game-movie conversion, and appropriately enough has a neat end credit sequence.Rating: * * *",Max Payne
99,C-Younkin,Max Payneful,3,20 October 2008,"If there is any substantive thing to take from ""Max Payne"" it would be this: the MPAA has turned to mush and is now being run by monkeys throwing feces at each other. That's the only way I can explain how this disgusting looking movie ever got a PG-13 rating. It's of course based on a video game, and like most video game movies that come out every year, it's meant to be a fun little ride with bullets, guns, and bad-asses who know how to use both to fatal effect. Last year ""Hitman"" was the big movie of genre and I feel it accomplished what it set out to do. Which brings me back to ""Max Payne."" The only way I can see this movie accomplishing what it set out to do is if director John Moore (""Behind Enemy Lines"") and screenwriter Beau Thorne got together and tried to make a movie that's offensively ugly and incompetent. This movie sucks, and it sucks hard.Mark Wahlberg usually plays good action heroes, but here he plays Max Payne, a NYPD homicide detective transferred to cold case files since his wife and child were murdered. Determined to find their killer, Max goes out every night looking for leads but always comes up with dead ends. Then a homicide detective buddy (Donal Logue) shows him the murdered body of a dead hooker killed in exactly the same way as his wife and suddenly he's back on the right track, even getting a partner in the hooker's sister, Mona Sax (Mila Kunis), and some help from his father's former partner, BB (Beau Bridges). Just where there's a dead hooker, trouble is soon to follow as soon Max is being investigated by an Internal Affairs Detective (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) for her murder and various other questionable deaths. Various discoveries are made along the way until the killer is finally revealed.Thorne's script is so short on explanations that it barely holds together. The movie throws drugs, hallucinations, a murder mystery, attacking birds, a devil's army, and the cover-up by a pharmaceutical company and for the most part I felt like an ass for even trying to make sense out of anything this silly. The rest of the plot can be seen coming a mile away and the dialogue said is some of the most ridiculous I've heard all year long. A character says of Payne, ""He's looking for something even God wants to stay hidden."" What will probably disappoint fans, however, is how few scenes of actual action are really in the movie, and how utterly devoid of excitement those few scenes are. Moore is a hack director in every sense of the word, relying on senseless, video-game style shootouts (accompanied by vile mood lighting) that don't thrill as much as glorify the violence. Is there a more overused action shot than turning to slow-motion to present a gun battle? Most of his computer visuals smack of being stolen from Francis Lawrence's far superior ""Constantine,"" except they look messier and far too overdone to really respect. And how many times can we see digitally created snow falling on the city in the dark night? This movie is style over-drive at its worst.And the actors don't seem to care. They seem to be approaching this movie with all the subtlety and dramatic weight of a porno. Wahlberg walks through the movie with a bored puss on his face, never digs deeper to show the character's tortured soul, and throws out lines like he could really give a crap what he's saying. I don't really blame him either cause I felt the same way. Milla Kunis (That 70's Show) is in the movie for some unexplainable reason, and she puts on her tough face in a performance that can only be described as laughable. Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges seems to be playing a detective in this movie but for the most part he just seems to be playing Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges. Amaury Nolasco (Prison Break) is a charismatic young actor who I wish could string together some decent movie roles, but that string isn't going to start here with his performance in the role of ""crazy guy who likes to stare at people and sometimes look down on them from stairwells and rooftops."" I have no idea what happened to Chris O'Donnell but he's taken a sharp decline since ""Batman and Robin."" Oddly, Clooney seems to have survived. And Beau Bridges comes off the best here but that's like saying that a half-eaten hamburger in a bag full of trash is the best.What really bothers me about movies like this is that it's all just violence and how best to package the violence in enticing, simple-minded wrapping paper. The villains are a collection of junkies, prostitutes, pimps, killers, and thugs who wallow in the gutter and the hero isn't that much better because all he wants is vengeance and blood. Both shoot their guns with as much care as if they were shooting in a video game. Both savagely beat on other people, sometimes doing it till death. Is there a difference between the two? Are we supposed to care here or just watch the bullets fly? Why is it that a movie featuring characters that are just violent and bloodthirsty can get a PG-13 but a movie that dissects the violence and ideas of vengeance like ""Unforgiven"" gets an R? It doesn't make sense to me and it sends out the wrong messages. I wish the MPAA would learn that.",Max Payne

101,politehere,If You Watch The Movie Twice You Might Feel Differently About It,7,28 February 2014,"Needless to say, Max Payne is one of those games that never gets old; thanks to its intriguing story and fantastic action sequences. I was hoping they would make a film based on the game and this is how they ruin such a great story? If they were serious, they would have aimed for a trilogy and remained faithful to the game's fascinating storyline.As for the movie, it tells a completely different story than what we are all used to so much so that I felt I had a dagger in my eyes the first time that I watched it. For someone who has played the game many times and is in love with the storyline and with Max Payne's revengeful character, the movie could be an excruciating experience the first time around, but I decided to watch it for a second time, but this time I had accepted the fact that the movie was only loosely based on the game.The second time around, I actually enjoyed the movie immensely. The cinematography is fantastic, the actors look and sound very much like the characters from the video game; except for Jim Bravura, who was a white old man in the game, but a young black man in the movie; a completely unjustified and annoying difference. Also, some of the sets, like Rosco Street Station and Max Payne's house are real life replicas of what we get to see in the video game. The second time, I also watched the credits roll and then we are shown a brief scene where Max Payne and Mona are sitting at a bar and glance at a newspaper story about Nicole Horne (Max Payne's main enemy from the game) which suggests that there's going to be a sequel and they are going to go after her. The problem is that the end of the movie places another character from the middle of the game as the final enemy in the location where Nicole Horne was supposed to be, which would make it really difficult to make a sequel look like the video game; and that would make a possible sequel even more disappointing for the fans of the game.The thing about this movie is that to enjoy it, you have to watch it more than once. The first time, you would be cursing the director for ruining the original story (I had given it a 2 star rating in my first review!), but the second time, you would be thanking him for putting so much effort into making the movie look so artistic, beautiful even ( a 7 star rating!).Let's all hope that ""Max Payne's journey into the dark will go on"".",Max Payne

You know when a guy wants to come to Max's apartment with some information that he'll be dead before he can impart it. And you know Max will be blamed for just about everything that happens. There will be no surprises. Now it's just a matter of toughing it out to the end. Even the scene near the end when Max is lying on the street freezing to death. My wife told me several minutes before what was going to happen and how, and of course it did.

103,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,Gloomy and Payne-ful to Watch...,3,31 January 2009,"I bet even Uwe Boll can cough up some of his slapstick cheese and make a better production than this. First off, the mass production of movies based on Video games needs to stop. Did Hollywood run out of ideas? The plot line is as follows:Max Payne's family gets killed. Max Payne finds out who killed his family and kills everyone who was involved with it. AND THAT'S IT.Usually vengeance is required to be only a part in real successful movies. Like Conan the Barabarian, or the new Punisher these movies have vengeance, but they don't abuse the concept and beat it like a dead horse. Max Payne drills revenge in your head until it hurts.How many times have we seen this plot before? This is a replica of replica of another replica in regards to another story. It's like watching and off-off Broadway production of a hit classicThe movie starts off in undeniable boredom with it's dark, cold and gloomy setting. This effect can work in horror films and Max Payne is not supposed to be one. Nevertheless it is as if direction tried to make it that way and if failed miserably. Sure the demon silhouettes were a nice touch but it is as if direction was desperate to make the movie somewhat interesting. I am sure it was a successful marketing technique in the trailers. Throughout the movie is gloom and more gloom with failed attempts of suspense and intrigue.Mark Wahlberg is continuing to ruin his reputation by choosing one of these bad monotonous cold face vengeance protagonist roles. There is no acting required to play his part. His character is too stiff and unbearable to watch. It depresses me to look at him sometimes. It's like he's the ""me-too"" version of Keanu Reeves. I don't even want to begin with the supporting cast, this was just a production that they want to put their name on. There are some decent name of Hollywood but they too are bland as the rest of the story to even mention, even Max Payne's sidekick Russian Mafia chick.The end of the movie was action packed but I feel that direction slapped it all together in a few minutes. An explosion, a few henchmen getting shot at, slow motion camera scenes, and a bad guy who dies in the end. Wow. Like I haven't seen that before...This is probably the worst vengeance flick I've seen a while. My score of 3 is rather lenient.",Max Payne
104,lopcar1993,One of the best Vidoe game adaption's ever made!,2,19 January 2009,"Max Payne is something of a rip-off, well the character at least the story is very original. The character of Max Payne is a rip-off of Mel Gibson's Mad Max. But I didn't really find that relevant to this film or the video game for that matter, no what I found good about this film was the dark themes and the gritty noir style that was infused into this movie. I'm a massive noir fan and this was a great joy to watch unfold on screen.The story of the Max Payne adaption differs much form the video game I've come to love, but that didn't stop me from going to see it in theaters I knew this would be a good film, and to tell you the truth I was right. I got into the story and I felt what Max was feeling and I Really connected well with it's dark story. But this film kind of let me down hard in some places the dialogue was terrible in some spots and the acting was not that of the highest caliber, but I didn't expect Oscar caliber acting in this film anyways. What I expected was out of this world, shoot out the lights fun and I got that and so much more.Mark Whalberg( who in my opinion did a very good job.) stars as the title character in this John Moore directed film the film it's self has less qualities than most Wahlberg crime dramas. But this one is a very good one to watch and it gives off a good vibe that can not be ignored. This film is easily forgettable if you don't pay close attention to the story and if you don't stop scrutinizing what is left out from the video game, this movie was easily a hundred million dollar maker. But it was mired down by it's video game ties and the fans who boycotted or protested to this film because it didn't follow the story to a T. But I'm here to tell you that it may not follow the video game ties, it may not follow the strict protocol of how the game worked but let me tell you it does live up to the spirit of the game very well and this film, if your forgiving delivers a mind blowing experience like no other.All in all Max Payne is an awesome movie.",Max Payne
105,Sjhm,This is a bad film,2,29 November 2011,"Seriously. This is a very bad film. I expected a great deal more than this confused mess. Even if you are only vaguely familiar with the games, this script is a disaster. It takes a while to work out what is going on, the first half hour or so drifts about pretty aimlessly. Then there is a period where it hops from cliché to cliché as stock scenes play themselves out one after another. It is all shot in the gloriously washed out dark and gritty colour scheme that we have come to recognise as denoting the moody, gritty game genre. And that is where I think the main problem lies, it seems as though the entire script has pinched little bits from lots of other genre movies, parts of this feel like Elektra, and parts are reminiscent of Sin City or even Batman Begins. If you have a couple of hours to spare, spare yourself this painfully bad film.",Max Payne

107,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,An ostrich-camel between blockbuster and content movie,5,14 October 2008,"The main surprise is that this screen-version of ""Max Payne"" dares to defy the ""subjective 3D shooter VG"" heritage, attempting to sketch a content movie about the agony of a deeply hurt and virtually invincible detective - the ""Angel Heart"" quotes are obvious, mainly in the snowfall shots. John Moore's directing is stylish and compelling, although marred by some awkward moments - the worst being the Valkyries, as convincing as a bunch of half-humanoid crows with Xmas-tree lights as eyes, who torn to pieces a chick, throw a dude of the window, and further don't solve anything more, except flapping their wings in the background when the hero suffers the throes of his conscience conflicts.Although not by far as rewarding as ""Shoot 'em Up!"", ""Wanted"" or ""Eagle Eye"", the movie offers an expressive visual show, worth at least the admission money, if not also two hours of your life. A word to the wise: endure the final credits (very well done, by the way) to the end: you will be nicely sent to the sequel.",Max Payne

109,alanpuzey,I should have hated this.,10,27 October 2008,"I'm over 60, I'm from England, I don't often like modern action films with lots of violence and I got absolutely nowhere playing the 'Max Payne' computer game - so I should have hated 'Max Payne' the movie, right? Well NO! I saw it on a lovely, big screen with vibrant surround sound, along with about five other viewers (it was the midday show in a cineplex in Chiang Mai, Thailand!) and I came away feeling I had been more thoroughly entertained by a movie than anytime previously this year.Although not an avid computer games player, I had persevered with the Max Payne game as I thought the graphics were the best I'd ever seen in a game, and the bits that I did manage to progress through were very effective. The movie, whilst obviously not copying the graphics exactly, was more beautifully stylized than I had dared hope for. The only comparable film I've seen would be 'Sin City'.Mark Wahlberg was excellent in his role and the supporting cast fine, particularly Beau Bridges. The story didn't really matter to me that much, it had resonance and was well paced with no flat spots - and carried me along to its climax, finally leaving us with the hint of a sequel.On the way home from the cinema I popped into a computer store and bought new copies of 'Max Payne' and 'The Fall of Max Payne'; need I say more!",Max Payne
110,Exiled_Universe,ONE OF IF NOT BEST VIDEO GAME INSPIRED MOVIES EVER MADE!!!!!!!,8,17 May 2019,"Despite all the hate this movie got because it did not match up to its video game standards, i never played the game so i dont know how well it adds up to it. I mean most video game inspired movies get bad reviews and rating take for instance the 2 hitman movies, which i though were way better than this, got terrible ratings on rotten tomatoes. I was like how in the HELL does that work. I also found out that i love the movies that everyone hates, well i know that im not the only one that loves the film. Like i said i never played any of the max payne games so thats probably why i like this film and thats probably why i like the hitman films because most people who play hitman or max payne will most likely watch the movies for them and come to realize that it does not match how the game was played out but i never played any of them. I think that the atmosphere was good and matched the snowy feel. I feel like Mark Wahlburg fitted perfectly as Max Payne. Keep in mind i am reviewing this from a movie point of view so i am taking the video game craze away and just focusing on the story of the MOVIE and not the games. I thought the movie had an ok amount of action. It should have been rated r though but meh it was still ok and at least it had some blood. What i also liked was the fact that every time someone got shot with a shotgun they would fly back like 3 feet so that was pretty awesome. I also feel like the whole flying demon thing was kind of silly at times but in the end i had NO complaints. If you have never played the games they watch it and if you have...beware. Oh and also the girl that died in the alley in the beginning of the movie was also the girl in hitman 2007 and in both of these movie she gets naked and acts like a hooker and a you know what slu... you know. But in this one she didnt get naked because of the pg-13 rating unlike hitman where there were three explicit scenes where she was fully naked. Does she like doing that nasty stuff for a living, does she wanna be known for that sort of thing in movies because there are websites where you can do that sort of thing you know. Or maybe it was just a coincidence and she was just instructed to do those scenes in those two movies. I mean hitman and max payne where only a year apart so maybe thats why, and maybe she does it in other films as well i dont know and i dont care. Anyway watch it. Ugh god i need to be more brief, this isnt a review on the actor.",Max Payne
111,EchoMaRinE,another bad movie that is based on a good game,6,15 August 2009,"Max Payne is a cop who looses his family while fighting with crime and the character is coming from a computer game with the same name. The game was a great success and it had unique ideas like bullet time which was slowing the movements of the enemy, giving you the impression that you are actually moving faster than them. In that sense, the game was like matrix. Max Payne was fighting with big numbers of criminals but he had also his emotional problems because of his loose. Coming back to the movie, you only see some scenes where he looses his family. The rest is mindless action which has nothing to do with the game. Mark Wahlberg certainly doesn't fit this character and the plot was so weak. Anyone who played the game will hate this movie. The rest will not even get what is going on, since the character development is very weak. So, this is another bad movie that is based on a good game.",Max Payne
112,KillerLord,The Whole Crew Was On Brain Dulling Drugs!,4,25 October 2008,"I am going to write down this entire comment in an FAQ format. Frankly, there is no other way I can think of writing anything coherent about this movie. So, I'll just try and answer some of the questions people have in mind about the movie.How faithful is Max Payne to the original game? Well, the plot has been borrowed from the game. Mark Wahlberg is just about okay in the shoes of Max Payne but there is no proper script nor anything else that supports him and makes him believable as a Max Payne. There is bullet time in one scene and that's all. The dark, unfriendly and the coldness of the environment has been faithfully brought into the movie but all the one-liners, depth and emotion of the game is completely missing.What are all those supernatural elements in the movie? The game was realistic in the sense that we did not see deranged people behaving crazy and nuts under the behavior of the drug. However, in this movie, a side effect of the Valkyr drug is hallucination. All supernatural elements like angels are hallucinations of the drug users. Does this supernatural stuff add or subtract to the goodness of a movie? It takes us away from the pain that Max endures due to the loss of his family. Even suspension of disbelief does not help if one wants to appreciate these sequences. It is way too silly for the theme of the movie.Does Mark Wahlberg make a good Max Payne? In looks and style, yes. Emotions and body language, okay on his own but not faithful to the original Max Payne. He is a different Max Payne from the game. But he hell sure should have played the game, it would have helped him. But since he has reported not to have played the game, I am okay with the off beat version of Payne he portrays but surely the script writers have been pathetic.Anything good about this movie? A bullet time sequence is decent. At one point, Max pays a visit to his wife in his dream who tells him that it not his time yet. Max gets an adrenaline rush and makes an attempt to get out of the ice cold water. This is a relatively well done scene. What about the bad part of the movie? This is the majority part. The script is horrible. You cannot understand no matter how hard you try the pain of Payne. There is no screen time devoted to convincing you that Max Payne has suffered a terrible loss. Nothing convinces you about the main plot. It is perfectly lame. The ending of the movie is horrible. The dialogs are horrible. Mona Sax is horrible. Natasha Sax is pointless. Overall, the movie is pathetic from both 1) Point of view of the game fan 2) Point of view of the unprejudiced movie watcher. What should have changed for the movie to be made better? Well, 1) Add 10 minutes of more screen time and convince us why we should sympathize and identify with Max. 2) Add 20-30 minutes of more screen time and make us understand the operation of the Valkyr drug and Michelle Payne's connection with it better. 3) Remove the supernatural element from the movie. 4) Either eliminate Mona Sax from the picture or give her something significant, nothing something in between both.These are four major points I found could have saved the movie.Movie goers, beware!",Max Payne
113,terrencepatrix,Max Payneful to watch,1,22 October 2008,"I so wanted to enjoy this movie. I'm a gamer and happen to enjoy the video game to movie genre. I simply could not find a redeeming quality in this film. Believe me, I tried. I kept my hopes up till the credits started rolling. And this film just plain let me down.Not only did it not live up to the hype whatsoever, I don't think this movie can even be classified as any specific type of movie. It didn't have action, it didn't have drama, it didn't have comedy, it didn't have wit, it didn't have romance...it didn't have much of any substance whatsoever. It literally had a combined total of about 10 minutes of action for 120 minutes. The plot is told through dialog that is revealed randomly through the sporadic conversations.The direction was horrible. It was obvious they filmed every scene at random and pasted them together. There is no natural rhythm to the movie...it jumps around without any explanation. Two times during the film Max Payne (Marky Mark) has a friend meet him at a bar...only to refuse to disclose any information and walk away 10 seconds later. It's completely pointless. Characters are brought in without any explanation to who they are, or why they are there. There is no depth to any character in this movie. At the end I still wasn't sure who Mila Kuniz's character was or what her role was.Like I said, I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I went in with an open opinion, and realistic hopes. In my opinion the people involved were looking for an easy paycheck and nothing else, and I find it insulting and sad that companies release movies like this to the public. It just shows it's rarely about entertainment and always about cash.",Max Payne

115,powerfull_jedi,We never feel the Payne,5,16 October 2008,"Once in a while a game based movie comes along. Only to have terrible reviews and generally disappointing box office performances. Now add a credible director with some respectable action credentials, billed as the next Richard Donner, John Moore and you have an equally credible action star, Mark Whalberg whose embarrassing Marky Mark days are long gone. Then you have a game which is just perfect for a movie.The end result? Nothing more then a disappointment. I should've figured it by now, with only 24 hours before the US premiere, barely any reviews are to be found, which lead me to believe that 20th Century Fox themselves didn't have much faith in the project.Max Payne goes the way of many others that have gone by: Dead or Alive, Hit-man, Doom and Alone in the Dark, to name a few.Max Payne would make a very good movie, but even in the hands of competent people, it feels nothing more then a messy and lackluster production.Enter Max Payne, who is pushing pencils but at the same time following clues that lead to the bizarre and brutal murder of his wife and baby son. All this related to a string of weird murders with people using tattoos. Max Payne starts digging around, as his trails keep getting cold and also teams up with a mob girl called Mona Sax who wants to find the culprit who murdered her sister. All this related to an odd drug that's making people go insane. Expect a lot of rough Jack Bauer-esquire questioning and gun play, right?Sadly, Max Payne is not as action packed as the trailers make it seem, expect only one actual gun play sequence in a very familiar place to fans who played the first game(the subway station). Then an investigation plot that seems to take forever, until we get to the much hyped twist and betrayal bit... all the time I was wondering, is this Max Payne?If it weren't for the visual presentation(which I will get to soon enough), this would be a very generic TV cop pilot episode. The fact that Max Payne is a 7 year old game hurts this movie's chances of getting out there, because a lot has happened in these last years, so it's twists and turns will be seen coming a mile away.While a literal translation of the game plot would be perhaps overly complex, anybody who remembers the original game, will be puzzled as to how this plot works, as it feels like it's jumping around. The lack of characters like the Punchinello mob and the secret society lead by Woden make the end result seem messy and the ending delivers no sense of closure at least for us, the audience as it comes quickly and abruptly.If feels like they picked the first two levels, ignored everything else and glued the final level, hoping it would tie the loose ends by itself, that's how it felt to me.Even the twist does very little to get people excited. In this case, part of the blame falls on the lead star himself Mark Whalberg who at often times seems to use the exact facial expression for either being mortified by his wife's slaying and when he's does something completely different. While Max's obsession in his the constant reminder of his family's loss and the movie environment looks decent, much of the character's mumbling and deep narration from the game is almost gone(it's shown in the early part of the film where Max is struggling to avoid drowning).Whalberg just doesn't sell Max Payne to me. He's not nearly as bad ass as he could've been, except in the final 20 minutes when he becomes deranged as a result of using that drug as well. Other then that, I generally cringed at his performance.Mila Kunis is also a huge disappointment, as she does very little, apart from showing up just in the right time at the end of the film. A mysterious character in the game reduced to a couple of eye candy shots for the male audience. In a brief moment sarcasm I'll say that her presence in the movie was as relevant as her role as Meg in the new Family Guy episodes.In short, Max Payne is yet another disappointing entry into the game to movie adaptation history, as the successful and critically acclaimed chapter has yet to written.Those of you expecting a decent cop movie, might get a cheap thrill or two if you're into the movie's premise and don't know what the game, the rest will better wait for a cheap movie night or wait till the DVD. It's just that disappointing.",Max Payne
116,because-of-him,Playing the game is a prerequisite to viewing the movie,9,30 April 2009,"The movie is excellent IF you have played the PC game or other version. Without doing so, the movie is confusing and distorted. There are numerous scenes, such as the train, the bedroom, the club, the business tower, the clothing and more that are directly from the PC game that I have played numerous times. The movie, Max Payne, is a rare jewel in that it maintains the sense that you are still playing the game while watching the movie. The game itself is high quality with movie-like scenarios with dark motifs and ominous snowy nights exactly like the movie. So, the low rating and derogatory remarks by many reviewers may be because they have no connection to the game. For gamers like me, the movie is top-notch all the way. I will certainly purchase the DVD.",Max Payne
117,A_Roode,Max Pain...,4,23 October 2008,"I'm trying to remember the last time I've been so disappointed leaving the movie theatre. 'Max Payne' is a film with two faces. On the one hand it is visually stunning, conceptually great and a feast for the eyes. The art direction, atmosphere and style have so much flair. John Moore conceptual and visual styling is a feast for the eyes. My problem is with the other hand: I need more than just style to look at if I'm going to enjoy a film. I need substance.All of the excellent visuals and atmosphere in the world can't over-ride one severe problem: 'Max Payne' has a script devoid of the dramatic glue that transforms it from a pastiche of episodes to a flowing story. The movie is so busy being gritty and dark that it forgets to give you characters who you care about. So much time is spent trying to build up the mystery that nothing is spent on character development. The irony is that the film needed to be twenty minutes longer to help fill in some of these connections, but already feels like it runs too long. This is Beau Thorne's first script and I won't pretend to think that it is easy to do an adaptation of anything -- let alone condense hours of a video game into an hour and a half of film. Some of the problems might have been easily solved. As just an example, Max Payne is driven, bitter and solitary. Why not open the film by showing the reason he is this way instead of leaving it until the movie is half done? Brutally edited and paced, 'Max Payne' is a story headed no where and taking forever to get there. The acting isn't bad -- given the material they have to work with -- and there was some relief in watching Beau Bridges chew scenery mercilessly as the movie grinds to it's conclusion. Mark Wahlberg turns in a typical performance and manages to look disappointed that he doesn't get to swear. Chris O'Donnell and Donal Logue are under-used and both Amaury Nolasco and Mila Kunis would have benefited from more screen time and character development. I wish that 'Max Payne' had kept it's Restricted rating. Because I wanted it to be harder edged? Oh no -- an 'R' rating would have kept more people from watching it.I will say that there were two decent action sequences and I thought they were both pretty decent. There is a good showdown in the office building ... twice. It might even be worth renting the DVD and fast-forwarding your way through a turgid boggy mess in order to see them. Unless you value style over substance though, give 'Max Payne' a pass.",Max Payne
118,NicolasCostoglou,I don't know about heaven. But I do believe in angels...,10,6 March 2017,"Max Payne is my second favourite Video game adaption after ""Prince of Persia the Sand of Time"".The movie is a clear and effective homage to the Noir-Thrillers of the 30's-50's in every aspect and that's what makes the movie great for me. This film doesn't rely on action sequences rather than telling a intriguing Thriller-story with a few very well handled action sequences, which are all unique and different.This is my favourite performance by Mark Wahlberg and that's saying something, because a year prior he showed us his worst performance in the weird ""The Happening"". He shows great subtle emotions and you feel for him the whole way through because you understand him. All the other actors also do a fairly well job, even Mila Kunis who is believable in one of her first serious roles.One of the reasons i hold this movie in such high regards is also the technical aspect of it. The look is beautiful and the camera-work and editing is great. It succeeds in capturing the style and tone of a real Noir-Thrillers, but with a modern take. Dark contrasts and long shadows, also the use of color in this movie is (while slightly on-the-nose) really well handled. Also the visual effects are really well done, most of all when people take the Valkyr-drug it's sheer amazing at times.The score by Marco Beltrami is some of his best work, and i'm a real fan of this composer for a long time.The story is slightly changed from the video game to make it work on it's own and so that it's surprising even for fans, and i appreciate it (being a fan of the games myself).I'm also happy they used Max monologues just at the start and the finish of the movie, because even in the game it's sometimes a bit to over-depressive and metaphorical at times.All in all i enjoy the movie very much, it even introduced me to the games, and even after playing both i haven't changed my mind at all...

120,soger,Ambiguous feelings,7,21 February 2009,"I didn't play the game myself but I looked forward to watch the movie because movies created based on action games tend to be full of action with lots of special/visual effects. Well, my feelings about this movie are ambiguous.But first things first: would people stop complaining about the script!!! What the hell do they want? There is nothing wrong with this movie's script, it's got twists and everything. There are tons of dumber movies out there. And if a really good script is vital for you then I suggest you visit a theater not a cinema.But still, I don't want to defend the movie. The first 69 minutes is just a plain old detective story and I'm not really fond of those. It's mostly just talking and I got really bored during it. The remaining 27 minutes on the other had delivered what the whole movie should have had delivered: good action scenes.",Max Payne
121,lekgolah,"For a film that was based on a action packed shooter, there is very little action",4,5 May 2010,"What I said in the summary pretty much sums up the entire film. Films that are based on games have never really had interesting dialogue. Maybe the Resident Evil films had a few interesting scenes but that is really all there is. I find it strange for a film based on an OTT action game that has the character shooting everyone devoid of any action for the first half. Instead it relies upon trying to create an interesting story through the use of dialogue. This was an ambitious move and the writers can be credited there but the end result feels like a TV film but with a few action scenes added towards the end. The dialogue is dull and the cast suffers for that. Mark Walhberg does a fairly good performance as Max Payne but for most of the film, he just scowls. We hear how dangerous he is (such as the Jamaican guy) but all he does is look angry and hit a few people. The rest of the cast are completely uninteresting. Ludicrous may have received a lot of negative comments in other reviews but at least he was enjoyable to watch unlike Mila Kunis or Jeff Bridges' brother. I watched the Unrated edition where I was expecting a lot more violence and action but instead there is one use of the 'MF' word, other swearing and some digitally enhanced blood effects. The action takes place in the second half of the film and while the action scene in the office was good, it still felt average compared to others. Bullet time, which was a big feature in the game is almost absent here. There were never any scenes that really stood out to me. Although the sound effects were very good I might add.This isn't The Matrix where you spend the first half developing the characters and then spend the second with enjoyable action sequences. This is based on an action game so for each third of the film we should be having an action sequence. Thats not to say that good films need shootouts but that is what you would expect from a film like this and since the dialogue is so uninteresting, you are left waiting for something to happen.Fans of the game will be disappointed by either versions of the film. While the action scenes were far from bad (the Unrated edition made them slightly more enjoyable) the overall film is very dull. Max Payne who is meant to be the man who criminals fear like Batman, but is sadly just another generic cop out for revenge.",Max Payne
122,unemployedvirgin,in cinema we have now entered the 'Vigilante Era',8,14 December 2012,"Having never played the video-games but heard of the title, this had been on my Watchlist for quite some time. Mark Wahlberg is a believable tough guy in this revenge fest set in an urban landscape. Really digging the comic book feel this movie had; it's as if the director and story-boarders really collaborated well to film each shot like a graphic novel. The blood splatters are almost artistic as the mystery antagonists slowly reveal themselves. I didn't really understand the connection with hallucinogens and Jack Lupino's murderous rampage. The focus on the drug infused states took away from the plot's premise overtime.With that being said, the intricacy of the storyline is still there with a unique cast portraying interesting characters that compliment one another. It's definitely worth viewing.",Max Payne
123,MoviesReviews101,Verdict: Video Game Action success?,5,13 September 2014,"Story: Having never played the games or even knowing anything about the games I could really see this fresh as an action fan. I was expecting some form of supernatural side to the story but I was wrong. It is just a revenge thriller that has lots of action and very little dialogue. Most of the support characters have very little development and are each only used to pass on a small part of the story. In the end as a standalone action film it is switch the mind of acceptable. (6/10)Actor Review: Mark Wahlberg – Max Payne the determined cop who wants to truth who ends up getting caught up in something bigger than he could have ever imagined. Solid from Mark but the fans of the games will dislike what he does to the character.

124,Strider_1978,It's Max Payne but not as we know it Jim.,6,17 October 2008,"My opinion has changed after viewing this film again, I view it periodically.The problems started, though I could not perceive them when Fox got a hold of it. The problems continued when John Moore and his production company received it. The nails were in the coffin when the Pg-13 cert emerged.In all fairness it was never supposed to be the computer game, but a film based upon it. The result of a six week shoot, a low budget, a team with bad production values and a director who would be more suited to production is very clear.Its not strictly Wahlbergs fault. I appreciate him taking the role and putting forth the effort. I do criticise him for not looking at the source material and relying on 'couching' rather than a direct link to the role. When I see Mark I don't see Payne, I see a character that dresses and moves similar to Max whose profession is a cop. WHen Mark looks serious I can buy it, when he tries to look emotional, putting himself in that dark place that he sent himself for the role the illusion dissipates. The acting is at best mediocre and at worst atrocious. The action that there is is heavily restricted by the pg 13 cert which dictates how much blood can be shown. So we get a very obviously staged series of runs through a pyro field and actors dressed as characters taking bullets and going down quickly. The film is mystery and not action, and so Moore lays on the visuals thickly. We can't have the Max Payne plot because the material is higher than a pg-13 and so we get a snail paced 'investigation' where the characters come and go. It is impossible to suspend disbelief because of how ridiculous and obvious characters and situations are. The only saving grace for the film is that the production company nailed the mood, tone and feel of the game. Max Payne has no kinetics, no oomph and there is nothing to chew on. By the time Max gets to Aeser we no longer care. At least there is Mila Kunis, though young and somewhat petulant in character, her chops manage to carry the film a little. A terribly miscast Bravura manages to hold his own as the ghetto IA man, the sizzling Olga really has some potential as an actress and her short role does give the film something more than eye candy. A glaring, glaring irony is that a completely insignificant character, the head of a Jamaican mafia that has absolutely no place in the MP world steals his scene, his role no more than five minutes- then we don't see him again. What the film desperately needed was some decent shootouts a la John Woo, or at least something akin to a bad Steven Seagal flick. Have Payne take out Boris Dime in the holds of a ship, fight his way past 20 thugs and then jump ship. Have Mona report to a man behind a desk that we don't see but hear. a man with a familiar Russian accent that might suggest a possibility for the next flick if they ever dare to make one. The best part of Payne, no, not the ending credits is the easter egg after them. It's a scene where I can actually see Max and Mona, mostly because there is little scripting. IT leaves room for the second film, only if they don't make it an R I have no idea how they will Pursue Horne (who I forgot to mention is one of the real highlights of the film) unless they intend to go after her with tranq darts.It's a bad film, punishment for gluttons like me who enjoy being thrown into the MP world, even if there is no cake beneath the icing.",Max Payne
125,Neenee-b,Payne to watch?,7,15 November 2008,"Most movies based on computer games tend to suck.Was Max Payne any different? I don't know and frankly I don't care because it stared the wonderful Mark Wahlberg.Everyone has a favourite actor and will watch and defend anything that they choose to star in and in his case it would be The Happening which is the most entertainingly, hilariously, bad movie made ever made.In Max Payne, Mark, playing a cop (what else can he play), uses his signature move, his perma-frown to show how sad he is after the untimely murder of his wife three years ago.This is in direct contrast to the bewildered perma-frown he debuted in The Three Kings and his angry perma-frown which earned him (a surprise!) Oscar nomination in The Departed. Clearly you cannot say that Mark Walhberg doesn't have acting range - either way it doesn't matter as he looks cool holding a shotgun.So off Mark goes to catch his wife's killer (he sat around in the police station boiler room filing up until this point) and along the way everyone he meets ends up murdered by some angry bald dude wielding a big ass sword, making his buddies in the precinct, who, in true Hollywood fashion, are all one doughnut short of a cliché! From the trailer it looked as though there would be a hint of Constantine about the film which would have been great but it was not to be - it was all about drugs. I don't know why that surprised me. Its always drugs. Always. Without exception.One thing about the film that really annoyed me was all the CGI snow which didn't actually fall, it just swirled around for a few moments and then it would start raining. Every time we were outside it was raining - hell inside during the worst cinematic gun fight in history someone turned on the water sprinklers. Hollywood clearly doesn't have to deal with water charges.Speaking of the terrible gun fight, Storm Troopers have more accuracy than security guards with automatic weapons. Mark Walhberg vs. twenty heavily armed guards. I suppose it shouldn't have been a shock to the system over who won that fight.Anyway, Max Payne catches the bad guys, doesn't get the girl as she cleared off before the final battle and was forgotten about by Max, the director and the audience and he does this without one witty quip!! Is it wrong were I am beginning to pine for the good old days were cops drove cool cars, took part in violent car chases and every time they cocked their gun or killed someone they automatically said something witty..Oh lord I have just described Bad Boys If you love Mark Walhberg you will enjoy Max Payne.If not the rain, fake snow, moping around, slow motion guns fights, lack of smiles and sunshine and constant aerial shots of New York will surely tick you off.",Max Payne
126,xtian_durden,More confusing than usual.,6,27 January 2009,"Did any of the creators even played it? They made it more confusing than the game itself. They've changed merely everything. I thought Mark Wahlberg fits in the role, but I didn't see Max Payne in him. It's completely different. We all know that Mark Wahlberg is a great actor, but he's not Max Payne. I know, there would be a Part 2, I beg them to make it more than this, cause I love the game. And they should put some more bullet-dodge scenes, cause it's the signature move of Max Payne.

Like the game, the film is dark, action packed and filled with lots of story.Mark Walhberg is phenomenal on screen as Max Payne and completely owns the role; the studio execs couldn't have picked a better suited actor! All the rest of the characters are well cast and contribute to making this such a fun film. Also Mila Kunis does a good job playing Mona Sax.The director did an excellent job of directing all the scenes, but he really earns credit for making several scenes and locations of the film extremely identical to the game.Those who haven't seen or played the game Max Payne will probably not like, appreciate or even understand this film or it's artistic style; it's dark and very nitty, gritty.Now normally I have some kind of nitpicking and complaining about just about any film I review, but I am at a loss of negative things to say about this film.Stunning visuals, great acting, an interesting and dark story all add up to a very well earned and well deserved 10/10.

No. It doesn't even cover the whole story arc, not by a long-shot. Does this movie make an effective use of bullet time? No!

First I appreciate the fact that all this flaws are visible from the very beginning and I was watching it stripped from any expectations, so it is avoided the disappointment in the end, which usually ends with 1 star on IMDb.

132,starving_college_student,A bad comedy...,1,27 March 2009,"...but the problem is this is supposed to be an action flick. Failing on all levels, I found myself laughing at points I knew I wasn't supposed to. And while this film has double the possibilities: (1.-an action flick for people who don't know the game or 2.- ""Max Payne the movie"" for those who know the game) it fails on both accounts.As an action flick, it is uninspiring, has on cue cliché plot points, and very stiff acting. The plot is a mishmash of dribble, based on a vengeful cop's remorse over his murdered wife which worked in the game (while in movieland has been used to death). Some characters/scenes even come to the point of being pointless. And after the movie is finish the viewer realizes that all the demon/angel imagery has 0% to do with the movie other than some eye candy for the director to waste money on.To those who know the game this is even more disappointing. They completely miscast the lead. Wahlberg is too all-American and his voice doesn't have the grizzled feel of a man with a heart filled with vengeance. He felt like too nice of a guy (even saying thank you in a scene). And the trademark moves/bullet time are only used once or twice which is the ONLY reason the game became so popular (and the only reason that this film was made) The makers of this completely missed the point of the game - to relive all the cool action/gun flicks. That was the point of the GAME. So what is the point of making a movie about a game that tries to let you experience being in a movie? Here is the answer: ......",Max Payne

The acting was really good, Mark Wahlberg was an excellent pick for Max Payne's role, and Amaury Nolasco as Lupino was spot on as well. The biggest issue I had was they missed like 90% of the story or just made up new less interesting plot routes.

134,shariqq,The pun - Max PAIN - is quite obvious.,2,16 October 2008,"Max Payne is a celebrated game, and with its film-noir/graphic novel roots, becomes an easy property to adapt for a movie. Yet, Uwe Boll... no, John Moore botched it up. The movie plays out like a cheaply-written foreword to what a real movie could have been. Although the visuals are spot-on, with muted and gray colors, bleak and contrasting visuals and especially the way the camera follows Max Payne in most of his movements, just like the game, that is all the movie picks of what made the game a success. The game's omnipresent voice-over narration by the titular character did begin the movie, but it dies a natural death hardly ten minutes in.Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg, back in Happening mode) is an NYPD detective whose family was left murdered one fateful day. He spends subsequent months hunting for one escaped killer. The movie picks up from when the dead-case heats up, and Max finds himself episodically partnered with a female assassin out of high-school.Max Payne really has nothing to go for it. The story itself takes you nowhere and the action sequences  the main expectation from this movie  leave a lot to be desired. Mark Wahlberg himself evokes no empathy or sympathy as we mechanically follow him from point to point in an inactive trance. The absurd obviousness of the antagonists for the audience also makes the entire runtime of the movie a ritual waste. To make it worse, all the ""cool shots"" were used up for the trailer. It ends up like a dream-less sleep  a lot of time goes by being inactive, but you are still tired at the end of it. Eventually, the anticipated end-credits come as a blessing.Eventually, the only thing to remember about this movie will be the effective use of Marilyn Manson's ""If I was your Vampire"" for its trailer.My Rating --> 1 of 5",Max Payne
135,MSusimetsa,Better than it is reputed to be,6,25 January 2009,"It seems to me that the fans of the game are disappointed because Max Payne doesn't have as much action as the original games. They really should realise that games and movies are different medium altogether. Like another reviewer said, the film opts for a quieter tone, and a much more thoughtful and introspective approach. It is a murder mystery game, not an action flick, and this is a big plus for it.Personally, as a father of a baby girl, I felt very involved with the plot all the way through. It did not reach the caliber of, for example, Gladiator, which has a similar theme, but it was still a decent exploration of the pain and sorrow that the main character feels.",Max Payne
136,baberchik,Modern Film Noire at it's finest,8,21 August 2012,"The review by ""pixelblink"" could not be more wrong. There are VERY few... scratch that... ONE very good video game adaptation, and that is this movie. That is was based on MP1 (game) rather than MP2 is a blessing. That game, despite being hopelessly old by today's standards had the most beefiest, juiciest storyline and virtually re-invented film noire type atmosphere. When I first heard of the movie being made, I was afraid it would just blatantly be a matrix-lookalike with the over-the-top slow-mo scenes, but instead it was a great big bite of the very beefy MP1 storyline. For pixelblink who obviously played MP1 in his sleep and remembers little of it, I will have to remind that storyline and ATMOSPHERE was all that the game had to offer, and this adaptation not being a Die Hard clone just with Max Payne, but a drama with SOME action scenes is exactly to the point. Some twists and some creativity that had little or nothing to do with the game, but if you can picture MP1 cut scenes being the basis for 99% of this movie, and you didn't skip even 1 of them in the game - you'll be in for a treat. About 3/4 in the movie is where the real action begins, and I did like the way it was done, surrealistically, and not just over the top. Turn your lights down, and have a bite of a very rare steak that is MP the movie.",Max Payne
137,raiderhayseed,Is Max Payne a Fable About the Discovery of Heroin?,5,20 January 2013,"I don't play computer games and tend to avoid films based on them, but ""Max Payne"" has an interesting twist in its tail. The story has it genesis in the discovery by a pharmaceutical company of a drug that will turn mere mortal soldiers into supermen, capable of fighting like Scandinavian warriors of mythological times, whom the valkeries would resurrect to live with the gods when they perished in battle. The company has had to cease manufacturing the drug when its side effects are discovered.That idea has resonances with another drug that formed the basis for cough medicines in the 1800's and was only outlawed in Australia in the 1950's. Can you guess its name???""In 1874 in the Journal of the Chemical Society chemist C.R. Alder-Wright described a series of experiments in which a number of acids had been combined with morphine. There is no clue as to why Alder-Wright should have carried out such an experiment, or even what he might have been looking for, but in any event the result of his labours was a long list of compounds, one of which was a chemical known as diacetylmorphine... It was to be a another 24 years before a German pharmacist Heinrich Dreser conducted further experiments with the drug. He discovered it had enormous potential as a powerful analgesic and popularised it with the name, heroisch meaning strong powerful or heroic. In future decades the drug was to become known universally as heroin"" (page 30, 31 ""Shooting Up: Heroin – Australia"" - author Simon Davies - published Hale & Iremonger 1986)Is ""Max Payne"" (pain as in hurt and suffering - max as in an abundance of hurt and suffering?) a fable about heroin? The book by Davies makes the point that it has often been used by soldiers in war situations.My inexcusable and unworthy pleasure in the film, ""Shooter"" has left me with a soft spot for the often incoherent mumbling of Mark Wahlberg, but his Max Payne did not affect me as much as his performance as Bob Lee Swagger. Maybe it was the surfeit of gun fights and explosions, or maybe the script was not just not as good.But do other films based on video games have such interesting subtexts? Does this mean I have to watch Laura Croft's tomb raiding exploits?Probably not. I think ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" did the whole exposure of problems of Big Pharma a whole lot better.",Max Payne
138,neacorp,I don't get it and don't want to even try.,1,20 January 2009,"I played both main games and this ""film"" was a ""disappointment"". It helps to know the events of the first game, but I pity those who never played it and saw the ""film"". It probably looks like mush of scenes to them.The game starts with the death of the family, mysterious phone call and then jumps to a bank rubbery and frame-up. Eventually Max fights through the mob, a junkie nightclub and a military base only to end up on the roof of a skyscraper and drops an antenna on a chopper with the main villain by cutting the guide wires. There are a lot of characters in the game and its nonstop action of gunfights and regular painkillers.In the ""film"" the simple story of revenge is substituted for god knows what. There were no mysterious ravens in the game and the 3 family killing assailants were killed during the incident. Anyone who played the first game knew from that this is WAY off as is the beginning scene from the mid of the movie.The gunfight only starts an hour into the movie so you know its boring before that. And the movie is only 95 minutes long. There are only 3 gunfights at all (offices, pier and station) and bullet-time is plain annoying. Being blown away may have worked 10 years ago, now we have Mythbusters to make the movie even lamer. Instead of painkillers (which should have turned Max in to a zombie by the end of the game the way I played) you get only the blue psycho drug and lame hallucinations. And to conclude Max simply kills a mid game villain on the roof of the station (no chopper), credits and then a scene in a bar where the real final boss is shown.They threw away almost everything intriguing of the original plot and put an hour of petty detective drama. If you want the real Max Payne story, just get the game, activate GOD mode to save time and experience it for yourself. Its WAY better than this ""film"".",Max Payne
139,shadowycat,Law & Order: Special Video Games Unit.,8,19 October 2008,"Game origin or not, this film stands on its own, and it's beautiful effort. The art direction is stunning. It is very noir and full of symbolism... and some complex and intense film making technique too.Imagine a TV crime show, The Crow, and Sin City all rolled into one. As a video game movie, it's unparalleled. BF advises they've taken some liberties with the game's version of events, but it works.It ran a little long and there were some red herrings along the way, but the overall ride is a good one.Notes on the actors: Wahlberg may be typecast as the tortured cop, but he brings it. Mila Kunis proves she has range (Compared with her portrayal of the obnoxiously perky desk clerk in Forgetting Sarah Marshall!) and Beau Bridges was perfect. People sitting near us in the theater snorted when Ludicrous (credited as Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) appeared. Not sure if that's a good thing. As a filmmaker, I don't think I want audience snorting when an actor appears based on just who he is... just sayin' ...He was OK though, and his performance was highlighted in my favorite scene which involved office mayhem (that is not a spoiler but it would be if I said more...)Go see - even if you're not into the game.",Max Payne
140,cyguration,Max Payne is a game with a story...so where was the story?,2,25 March 2010,"When every gamer and fan of Max Payne (the original, not the gaudy sequel) found out that Hollywood had tapped Rockstar for one of the most celebrated and praised video games in recent history, a lot of gamers were excited.Let's get one thing out of the way for non-gamers: Max Payne is a heavily noir-oriented game that is entirely fueled by a dark, brooding overtone involving corruption from the city streets all the way up to city hall. It's a game that focuses deeply on the psychological trauma of a cop whose family is murdered and he eventually becomes a depressed DEA agent that gets framed for murder. Max Payne is probably one of the few games with a story that's better than most crime movies, seriously.Fast forward to the release of the movie and gamers and non-gamers alike have been completely confused on how the heck this movie turned out as bad as it did. Nothing good from the game translated over into the movie...not the narration from Max, not the poetic scenes, not the action...nothing. There were about 10 plot points in the game that could have been used to convey a purposeful and deep rooted movie, full of meaning and intrigue yet instead we get a movie full of fluff.Heck, they could have focused the movie on the corporate corruption affecting the lower-grade of our social order; they could have focused on the police corruption involving the pay grade that separated the haves from the have nots (which was a strong overtone in the game); they could have focused on the drug addiction, either that of the low-lives using the drugs or Max's saddening addiction to pain-killers (an extremely strong crux of the first game). There's so much more from the game that was just compelling and at times breathtakingly poetic that was just completely passed over, skipped and misused in the movie. They didn't even bother to interpret the eerie dream sequences involving Max's guilt over his wife and child dying. Instead, Max Payne the movie delivers less than a handful of actual shootouts (and poorly edited shootouts at that), and the whole diving and shooting thing that made the game famous seems to be underused in the movie. Mila Kunis looks too young for Walhberg, which creates an uninteresting relationship between the two. The movie's pacing is horribly slow and because of that it forfeits its right to be called an action flick (because an action movie needs actual action scenes every so often so the crowd doesn't get bored). There are no fight scenes and only one watch-worthy shootout in an office building and even that's kind of short and forgettable. I'm running out of words, but hands down this movie could have done 100 different things with its plot to be 10 times more interesting and engaging than what it was. This isn't a good movie for gamers and non-gamers alike. It's boring, too long, too stiff, unevenly paced and just a bad cash-in by Hollywood.Hopefully, five years from now, someone will reboot this movie where it's not two hours of wooden acting, boring action sequences and a plot that's been recycled from twenty years ago composed of predictable characters and an ending that was visible a mile off.This movie isn't even bad enough to be funny, and that's the sort of bad worth avoiding.",Max Payne

It was a lot like Constantine mixed with realistic science. Action was pretty amazing. Basically it had all the elements u wud expect from a Mark Wahlberg Movie. His acting was really sincere and intense as always. If ur a Jason Bourne trilogy/shooter/The Departed fan, this movie is for u. Mila Kunis is been my favorite since I was a kid and watched her in That 70s Show, she is extremely gorgeous and a great actress who deserved this role.

142,chi-cerca-trova,"Good, but not great",7,18 October 2008,"*HAVE NOT PLAYED THE GAME, RATED AS A MOVIE* I am a big fan of film noir. It sort of acts as a counter to either extremely melodramatic heroes or the too-polished ones. So, I must say I had an affinity for this movie before going in.Since I am not acquainted with the source material, I cannot give a fair comparison to the game. As a movie, I must say the aesthetics and style were top notch. The dramatic shadows, the deliberate camera, the stylistic character development all hearkens to noir classics like ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"" to name a few. While the dialog was cheesy and predictable, it had it's own style to it that became endearing. The gunfights, while few, were kinetic and engaging.However, it had some style choices that were quite erroneous on the part of the director. While the Valkyrie imagery was an interesting metaphor and well done, it was done way over the top that distracted from the scene in the movie. Rather then enhancing the scene, it distracted from some very powerful cinematography. Another was a deliberate ripoff from Gladiator. The whole pseudo-Elysium dream sequence was a direct tear from Gladiator, and his wife even says ""Not-Yet"".All in all, not too bad of a movie. It was a tight movie that clipped along and didn't take itself too seriously. My gripes were more of style over substance that detracted from what could have been a great movie.Oh side note: I don't know if this has been done before, but the end title sequence get's a 3/10.

How can game-inspired characters become more than just one dimensional? And that is where Max Payne suffers. Whilst Wahlberg puts a brave face on for the duration, there is a mountain of unlikelihood to overcome here, and the plot suffers immensely. Setting such an impossible series of events in real time means there is never any credibility, as Payne becomes a hunted man following the death of a Russian acquaintance (played by Bond girl Olga Kurylenko). These movies should be set in a fantasy land from where they are conceived. There are plenty of fast paced action set pieces which are easy on the eye, but ultimately this is just well meaning nonsense.",Max Payne
144,on_the_can,A whole lotta nothing,4,30 October 2008,"Video game movies have been hit and miss and as such have earned a pretty shoddy reputation. I've never been one to condemn one movie for the pitfalls of its predecessors anyway but the trailers to this film looked like it might promise something new and interesting. It doesn't.The trailer (definitely augmented by the use of Marlyn Manson's 'If I Was Your Vampire')implies a film noir quality and textured feel like Sin City. The opening few shots of the film appear to be living up to that image. Max Payne has been left for dead in an icy body of water only a few yards from a decaying pier. It's night and the moonlight soups everything in blue, black and white tones and Max's narration of his impending death could make any noir fan shiver. It's remarkable however, how fast that slick opening collapses into a meandering cliché filled cop out for revenge plot. Conspiracies are revealed here and there, a strange new hallucinogenic gets passed around, a few hot chicks dance for the camera, Max looks constantly ticked off, dialog gets spewed with monotone attitude and a few bullets hit a few targets, but none of it stitches together the way it was likely meant to and the end result is the reason video game movies have earned their reputation.Some of this could have been salvageable if the movie offered the unique and cool look offered by its trailer but it just doesn't. Save for a few money shots made with masterful execution the rest of the film is reasonably run of the mill with very little attempt at anything unique in art direction. It's also pretty light on action which would have at least made it more entertaining. The cast is loaded with a surprising amount of recognizable faces but their talent is wasted on the material. The only element that continually impressed me was the slowly falling snow(I assume it was digitally added), which helped to give a really ominous look to it's many night shots, but it's a pretty sad thing when the strongest element of a film is the climate it was set in.There are certainly worse action films out there than Max Payne, but this one could have waited for TV.",Max Payne
145,arc_a2007,It's like something from fanfiction.net,1,2 November 2008,"As a die-hard fan of both Max Payne games, I hated this film. Video game adaptations have hit a new low. Hit-man, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat... they're all really terrible. But they're practically masterpieces compared to this. There are just certain things you don't do with your source material and this movie did them all. Where shall I begin? They changed Nicole Horne into a cameo role. She gets one or two brief glimpses in the entirety of the film and has nothing to do with anything. In the game, she was the hand behind the scenes, setting in motion every nightmare that would come to haunt Max. Why? In the game, Jim Bravura was a middle-aged white police chief. Here, he's a young black lieutenant. Again, why? Jack Lupino was little more than a boss in the game, someone Max had to plow through about midway through. He's given quite a lot of attention here, including a ridiculous backstory and anti-climactic confrontation.Mona Sax had a major role in the game, but she's really pushed into the background here. And Mila Kunis could not be any LESS convincing as a dangerous, gun-toting femme fatale.What's the deal with those ""valkyries""? Is this an emo fanfiction or something?

146,deltajvliet,Max Payne: Revisionist Action Noir,7,17 October 2008,"The movie starts off somewhat slow, save a nice little scene in a dirty subway bathroom that shows just how desperate detective Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is to avenge the deaths of his wife and infant. As the film progresses and we learn more about Payne, the details surrounding his family's death, and several other factors affecting the storyline, director John Moore treats us with some rewarding action sequences in the last two thirds of the movie. The end was kind of predictable, but that's not the point. If you're going to see the Max Payne movie, chances are you'll see exactly what you wanted to. Mark Wahlberg makes for an especially effective badass. He's cool, he's unflinching, and he brings a degree of emotional depth to what would otherwise be a one-note character. But best of all, he wields a shotgun with all the coolness of Bruce Willis kicking ass and taking names in Die Hard. He takes on a whole SWAT team; he goes into a criminal stronghold with nothing but a gun and a death wish; he does that thing where he just holds the slide grip of a shotgun and cocks it one handed. I remember reading an article that said there's a shortage of cool tough guys in Hollywood right now, that Jason Statham is basically the only guy filling the void left by Stallone, Scharzenegger, and to an extent Bruce Willis. Maybe Marky Mark can be that guy now; he nails it here. Max Payne is neo-neo-noir. It's like a whole new approach to the genre, like if you took Sin City and Se7en and combined them with Hard Boiled to form some sort of super movie composed of people perpetually obscured by shadows with bleak lives and depressing backgrounds who manage to constantly get into gunfights set against a dark, desolate, forlorn city where happiness is virtually unheard of. The visuals reinforce how innovative the movie feels. They're reminiscent of movies like Sin City and 300, but they're not so much CGI or surreal, just revisionist takes on noir. And these visuals make for a great backdrop to the action. They complement some eye candy bullet time, add to the grittiness of shootouts, and in general enhance all the violent goodness the action junkie in me loves to see on a visual level. That said, the shootouts were decent in their own right. One within an office building was especially noteworthy. Watching glass shatter, things explode, and dust fly as the good guy who epitomizes cool runs for cover while simultaneously shooting his way out of the situation will never get old. And Payne's drug-induced berserker mindset towards the end of the movie makes for another great several minutes of flying bullets, too. And yet, I felt a little disappointed in that there wasn't more action. The movie has its fair share, but it was one of the best aspects of the film and more really wouldn't have been to its detriment. Moore's take on action and noir is entertaining and innovative while Wahlberg steps up to the plate, but the movie drags in the first half and just doesn't come off as that compelling. Still, I believe I just witnessed the first serious minded video game adaptation I can call good. Sadly, the critics don't seem to agree, but then what do they know? 7/10",Max Payne

But then sees he wasn't the one responsible. What happens is a Satanic action adventure that ensues with blood and bullets.My Spiel: This is your basic revenge story of a man's family being murdered. But then takes a turn to the dark side. This will be a little strange but this had a lot of demon - satanic visions. Not that it bothered me it was just a constant theme in it, I just thought it was funny how far we have come, but I am straying from my review. I have to say I only sort of liked this movie. The action was normal. the Character development was average. The only thing that made it unique was the mix of Demon visions when he takes a drug that enhances your abilities and senses. I don't want to rune the story but it was fairly obvious what was going to happen. This should of just stayed in video game form which it was originally based off, when all you have to do is run and gun your enemies down. There wasn't a big character development because the makers wanted a new slick game with slow-motion firing sequences. But its obvious Movie makers are running out of stories and ideas so they are resorting to games and comics to get there ideas.End Result: If you don't mind your normal action movie. With a splash of satanic stuff, or shall I say quite a bit of it. But don't let that bother you. this is just a average movie, nothing special in my book. I left the theaters just thinking what was really the purpose of this. But to extinguish about 2 hours of my life, ""O that was it!"" Max Payne (2008) Review: A Friendly 5/10",Max Payne
148,rdbrown-zeteo,Good movie.,8,7 August 2010,"The biggest complaint I see with this movie is the script. So, the script isn't that great? I don't have a problem with the script. However, for me, what made this movie good was its style, the actions sequences and the visuals.Sometimes, the script is not the most important thing in a movie.Here, we have a mediocre script but the story is still pretty good and is still well told through the style, action and visuals of the movie.One of my complaints is I wish there was a cool fight scene with Payne and the crazy guy with the machete.Overall, I really like this movie.",Max Payne
149,gundognc,"Max Bordom, Min Continuity",1,23 November 2008,"Lets get something straight, I liked the game Max Payne but despite what all the tiresome geeks are probably saying, it only had a good story by comparison with other computer games  most of which revolve around an intricate plot of ""kill everything that moves between point A and point Z"". Recover your memory and discover that you are actually the baddie.What passes for narrative depth in most computer game is the choice of weaponry you get to exercise said slaughter. To be fair, games are about fun not about deep and moving storytelling and that is as it should be, after all I cannot see a successful game being made in which the controls are: Left Thumbstick  Control level of world-weariness.Right Thumbstick  Boubon / Cigarette.X button  Crack wise.Y button  Smack dame in the face.(from EA's forthcoming game based on Dashiel Hammett's The Maltese Falcon)Having said all that, what the game Max Payne did was to set a scene very well. It was a clever, knowing, if extremely derivative take on the noir genre, tipping its digital hat to everything from Ramond Chandler to Elmore Leonard.Sadly Max Payne the film does away with all the humour and lacks the entertaining derivativeness of the game's storyline as well as the noir overtones.-- Spoiler -- Max is an unhappy widower who's family was murdered by drug addicts. There's this drug, Valkyr, which makes 1 person in a 100 into an unstoppable killing machine and the other 99 get chronic terrifying hallucinations before they go completely spanko and top themselves. Unsurprisingly, people are lining up around the block to take this wonderful stuff! I can see the addicts saying ""You know, I like heroin, but I'd really like something that drives me to suicide with horrific visions"". In a brilliant double bluff, this drug's street name is the same as the name it had when it was being marketed by the Aesir Corporation to the military as a combat enhancement drug. None of the geniuses in the NYPD have worked this out, including Max who's spent three years working on the case.Max meets a girl, Natasha Sax (Kurilenko) who attempts to seduce Max for no well explained reason shortly before being hacked into tiny little pieces. Natasha's sister Mona is understandably upset and blames Max for her killing. Max has other problems however as his former partner discovers a connection between Natasha and the people who killed the Payne family and gets topped himself for his trouble.Max, now on the run from the NYPD finally realises that the Aesir corporation (for which his wife worked) may be involved and by an enormous fluke goes to see the one chap at the Aesir corporation who's conveniently just found out all about the whole Valkyr deal. Chris O'Donnell has a walk on part as the talkative Aesir executive. How the mighty have fallen. There was a time when COD was starring in high-quality Hollywood output like Batman and Rubbish and Vertical Smile... Limit, sorry, Vertical Limit.After a tiresome bit of violence Max finally works out that the baddie is the only other recognisable actor in the film and kills him (and a lot of Aesir staff along the way).-- End spoiler -- Other reviewers have said that Max Payne ""Best game to film adaptation"" and they are right. Given however that the list of game to film adaptations includes some of the most profoundly bad films ever made (see Streetfighter, Wing Commander and absolutely anything made by Uwe Boll) I am not sure that this is the ringing endorsement that it could be.Max Payne isn't bad enough to be laughable or good enough to be enjoyable. Sadly after Wahlberg's last couple of outings as a leading man (The Shattening & We Own the Shight) I get the impression that he is better as a supporting actor than as a lead. I can't really recommend this movie at all. If you loved the computer game then you'll blow a gasket with the nerd rage. If you have never heard of the game then you'll wonder what the hell is going on and what the fuss is about.",Max Payne
150,moviefreak2010,The film stabbed me in the heart.,1,2 November 2008,"Max Payne is considered by me the worst movie that I ever seen in my life. Why???, simple, because I'm a die hard fan of the video game and its sequel. The story of both games was very complex, twisting at every turn and the nightmares in the game make you feel like you're in a real nightmare. Along with the story is a whole lot action scenes and slow motion in vein of John Woo and The Matix.The only thing that is nightmarish about this movie is me watching this movie unfold. Barely any action at all, and no slow motion except for two scenes. And whats up with the demon angel from the drug???? They shredded and burn the complex of the story and make more basic and boring and uninteresting.The actors are not to be blame because how are they supposed to know about the video game and the true storyline.If I ever met John Moore, I will seriously tell him that he is a disgrace and he had ruin a good video game by releasing this piece of garbage.I hope this review is helpful to anyone that never seen this movie.",Max Payne
151,jmcfrancis,A lazy movie that goes nowhere,2,13 December 2008,"Let's disregard that the movie seems to skip the plot of the games completely. It's ironic, really, because the game stories were actually better paced and presented. But the movie, well, the script is terrible, many of the characters feel really underused and - the clincher - the first (of two) proper action scene happens two-thirds into the movie. Mira Kunis' character feels completely shoehorned, a couple of things never get resolved and the whole thing just drags its heels. Whalberg does a good job playing his role, but the whole thing just doesn't hold up. It's dull, it bores and time seems to take forever to pass. Max Payne is rubbish.",Max Payne

Clearly there was little thinking all round when it came to casting in this tragedy. The Max Payne game thankfully bears little resemblance to this shambolic reinterpretation. Mark Wahlberg just hasn't got any charisma, why oh why do directors give this guy parts in big budget films?The storyline briefly resembles the story of the game, however Max Payne is brutal in the extreme as you would expect from a video game. Video games are a basic 'shoot em up' with little or no regard for realism, the problem with the film is they have tried too hard to make it believable. They have tried to give Max Payne a human element which frankly destroys any hope of this being a good film. This is a big budget film and in parts is beautifully shot, the CGI is top rate the scenes with the demons are well done. So, what makes this terrible? Mark Wahlberg... it wouldn't have made a difference if he had played the game Max Payne! Simply because he is unable to portray any emotion, Wahlberg is miscast for this film (or any other for that matter). Beau Bridges is a great actor but struggles to be able to convey a bad guy, I know that Beau is meant to come across as a good guy initially but we all know he isn't.Sadly the ending left it open for a sequel, please, please, please don't let this happen without a total re-imagination that resembles the original story and re-casted with appropriate actors for the part.",Max Payne
153,evilresident097,Not too shabby at all for a movie based on a game....,8,16 December 2008,"I usually don't like movies based off of games, but for Max Payne, I'd be happy to make an exception. This is a worthwhile experience.The acting, though somewhat flawed, is actually pretty good. Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg was a good choice as Max Payne and he shows the sadness and vengeance in Max's heart. Mila Kunis of Family Guy was alright as assassin Mona Sax and Olga Kurylenko, the newest Bond Girl, gave a good pre-Quantum of Solace performance as Mona's sister. Heck, even Ludicrous wasn't too bad as an Internal Affairs agent.The action was great. The bullet time, though limited, was pretty neat. The shootouts were fun and fast paced. The final act is the best part. Those CGI Valkyries were creepy and dark, just like the film's mood.The only real problem was the script. The lines are so preposterous that I chuckled here and there thinking, ""Only an amateur would come up with those lines."" But aside from the clunky script, I think Max Payne was good not only for the fans, but for newcomers and action seekers.8/10",Max Payne
154,darlybrito,"Good action, not so much for the script",6,23 January 2009,"When I saw the trailer of Max Payne, it caught my attention. The story looked interesting and I was looking forward to watch the movie. The movie was enjoyable, but not the script. Mark Walhberg was a great choice to play Max Payne and he didn't disappoint.Max Payne is cop, whose being investigating the brutal murder of his family and wife. Hungry for revenge, Payne's obsessive investigation takes him to a dark journey that leads to a evil underworld.The story is very interesting until the point where I felt like it had way too many turns. This was the main problem that I had with the film. It was good during the first 30 minutes, but the rest confused me quite a bit. At the end, I understood the plot better, but I could off enjoy the movie more if it wasn't for the twists.The performances were good, except for the actor who plays B.B. Hensley. I felt he was just reading his lines instead of acting them. Mark Wahlberg was great as Max Payne. He really fits the character and he executed the role well. The hottie Mila Kunis was also great as Mona Sax. She is pretty bad-ass in the movie. Amaury Nolasco plays Jack Lupino, an ex-soldier, who goes nuts after drinking something in the movie. You'll know what I'm talking about. He really freak me out the first time I saw him in the movie. I thought he did a good job as Lupino.I thought the action and special effects were awesome in the movie. The action was top-notch and violent too. The demons like creatures look very cool and look a little creepy too.Max Payne is a entertaining movie, but the script problems was what left me not liking the movie more. The action was great as I said before and I don't think it will disappoint. Max Payne was a fun movie to watch and nothing else.",Max Payne
155,nunemkh,Great action film.,9,20 October 2008,"MAX PAYNE is a new action film based on a video game. There seems to be allot of game to movie adaptions lately. It has a good cast and and allot of enjoyable action scenes and allot of drama and twists.If I were to compare to another movie I'd probably say Sin City, although that's only because of the similarity in the cinematography and the characters. Although MAX PAYNE takes place in New York, it's definitely not the New York we have on this planet. Max PAYNE really has an other-worldly atmosphere to it.The plot is very similar to the plot of the original video game: a detective who has lost his wife and child is framed for murder and there's this hole thing about a drug made by the government. It was very interesting. I normally don't like action movies that are about the government corrupting the world with conspiracy and all that, it just doesn't interest me. But this movie was much more about the characters and the affects of the drug that the government made, not too much about the actual government it's self.This is definitely better than RESIDENT EVIL or SILENT HILL, which weren't bad movies, they just sorta missed the mark and i feel this movie didn't. Keep in mind however that this is coming from a guy who hasn't played any of these games. I simply think MAX PAYNE is a much better movie, whether or not it's a better adaption is beyond me.I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action movies with complex, yet understandable plots.",Max Payne

I don't know what Beau Bridges and Mark Wahlberg were thinking... well I do, I guess they were looking at the script through green-tinted glasses.Mere minutes into the film I could see what was coming a mile off. One only needs to have played a few video games to be able to figure out that the big corporations are always evil and that the guy you think is Mr Nice is actually quite the opposite.The valkyries were quite creepy, it's one of the few things I can say that's any good about the film but they're really not well used in the story and are only imaginary beings anyway so what was the point?

This movie calls for just a little bit of mental effort, but it is well worth it.I was AMAZED by the well thought out PLOT, the subtext, and the almost believable action. It was slightly violent, I guess a requirement for the modern, mindless masses, but at least there was some soul to the film. There was a complex message. There was suspense.The special effects were right on target for such an intricate plot. I sat on the edge of my seat during several scenes and was constantly being surprised by the turn of events. This movie has sadness, friendship, retribution, and determination -- all oars are in the water and propel the viewer along at a good clip.It's a rare action movie that delivers more than just mind-numbing violence these days such as some recent and pathetic super-violent films I will not name here. This production shows a smooth development of action, reasonable characters, and good performances. The music was outstanding. The movie managed to balance reality with altered-reality with such a unique feel that the whole exceeds the parts.",Max Payne

No not in the slightest. But it's still a great time, Mark Wahlburg is a great actor as Usual and Mila Kunis isn't too bad either, the action is great and the length is perfect without outstaying its welcome.Yeah some parts are dumb and its a predictable plot and doesn't follow the games perfectly. But it does follow the game, and it doesn't have to be perfectly, everyone needs to stop complaining, no it does not deserve a 10, i'd say about a 6.75, which for a video game movie, is GREAT.

While the action sequences were somewhat enthralling, they were so blatantly unrealistic that your suspension of disbelief is put on hold more often than not. The acting was amateur at best, and while I love Mila Kunis, it was hard to imagine Jackie from That 70's Show. Mark Wahlberg couldn't even save this fail of a movie, the direction and writing were so bad that you care nothing for even the main character, let alone any of the side characters. Don't even get me started on the time wasted on special effects. The story was extremely shallow, and nonsensical; nowhere near the original video game's depth of character and plot development. The director said he cared nothing about the game and it truly showed. We can only hope this teaches him a lesson, but something tells me, that's a no.",Max Payne

I awarded a 2 rather than a 1 because of the atmospheric snowfall throughout. Watching snow fall is, after all, better than watching paint dry.The actors do a reasonable job of impersonating video game characters -- totally two-dimensional and displaying nothing resembling personality or humanity. Anyone who hasn't been lobotomized should be able to figure out everything that will happen in this film within its first ten minutes.If you happen to be accompanying an 11- to 15-year-old boy who refuses to leave before the totally predictable ending, and you find it difficult to fall asleep because the movie is so atrociously loud, you might try counting dead bodies in lieu of sheep.

For a fresh new story about cop taking his revenge against drugs and conspiracy this is also too loose in terms of script. I won't join my voice with the chorus saying ""this is not how it had been in the game"". The lowest-rate reviews are of that kind. Yet, writers had to choose side. Which they did not. In terms of brand new movie this is simple: plot seems too much generic. Just another cop who takes revenge for his family against conspiracy and corruption. How many of that kind do we know? A lot.In terms of screen adaptation there's too little of Max Payne in this Max Payne movie. Yes, we've got picturesque scenes and precisely directed vignettes (more of the visual kind). But... you know, that is all. Not a movie of Max Payne, but a movie with a cameo of Max Payne. Some different story that takes place somewhere in those parts, and remarkable details glimpse to you now and then. Yet, a totally different story. Not only in script (god knows, that is not necessary) but in the terms of feeling. Bright sun, neat offices, cute family-driven premises are not the things that should surround us! Still... I can't say this is a bad movie. Everything but script seems supreme. To me, at least. I really like visuals.

Then halfway through I realised it was based on a video game, and suddenly I actually enjoyed it.I have not played the game but I've seen plenty of story lines unfold in other games. If you look at this as a film in its own right, the story seems very clichéd and the overly dark visuals look like ""Underworld"" on a bad day. But looking at it as one big video game makes the whole experience a lot more fun. Amazing sets, great slow-mo shootouts, and stunning cinematography and framing make for a fairly unique experience.Visually this seems to be in a league of its own.. was expecting a ""Sin City"" styled film, but the visuals and atmosphere in this are unique.

In this movie Max doesn't pull out his gun until over half way through. This movie could have been shot in black and white and made into a modern day Film Noir, like what they did for Sin City.But No, they massacred a perfectly good video game, Hollywood takes another well known name and wrings it for all the money it's worth. It's a tragedy really.I mean first you see Jackie Berkhart, which is depressing, but then you see Donal Logue and your thinking AWESOME! then he dies a scene later, then Ludicrous shows up, and he has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, it's like that character was made just so they could put ludicrous in this movie so people would watch it. And don't even get me started on Mark Wahlburg He's short, and just totally does not fit the role of Max Payne. Whoever did the casting for this movie, just needs to lose their job.Whoever approved of this garbage needs to lose their job, I mean taking Max Payne and making it into a stupid drug movie, with a drug that makes people hallucinate demons come and kill them.Terrible, don't watch this movie, I mean I had just got done watching Shoot 'em Up and that movie would have been better named Max Payne.

There is a shootout and a twist as in all this types of movies. It has some weaknesses but it does not try to fix the real world y hitting the viewer in the head with a stick and trying to play on their emotions so that they accept that it was their fault they did not like the experience.
I would have given it a solid 7 or 8 but went for 9 because I watched it first time 2020 and I could see strong female characters and immigrant characters etc and all this without lecturing. That is very seldom these days.

167,mickran,It's fast paced editing doesn't cover up a very slow and predictable script,1,22 November 2008,"15 minutes into this movie you're shown all the clues that you need to guess the outcome of this predictable action thriller. Abandon Entertainment seems to be under the impression that all movies should open with a bang and just keep going through to the end at breakneck speed and that it will keep audiences enthralled. Unfortunately it leaves you numb and uncaring about all the characters that are introduced and killed at such a fast pace you can barely remember their names. The director doesn't even know the basics of good cinema and introduces one new character after another in an offhand way making them as forgettable as the cliché action sequences which even include the classic: hero running through the glass corridor under a hail of bullets and shattering glass. Yawn.Style wise it is a half baked attempt at film noir mixed with some unrealistic CGI that may be a nod to its game origin but ultimately take way from any sense of believability. Slow motion sequences are thrown in at arbitrary points with little effect. The scary bad guys are not scary with the exception of a tattoo artist who is very well played and extremely creepy but again the director's incompetence wastes that scene racing through it as quickly as possible to deliver the facts rather than relish the mood and spooky effect it could have delivered to the movie which needed it so badly. The climax will have you slapping your self on the forehead as an expression of disbelief and self flagellation wondering why you watched the entire movie when you knew who the bad guys were right at the beginning thanks to the incredibly heavy handed hints delivered with all the subtlety of a sledge hammer. Not to give too much away but... it also has the worst underlying concept for evil doings since Catwoman.

There are a couple of great shots of snowy New York that resemble the original game, but this is where all the positives end. This movie is a disgrace to one of the most popular and beloved franchises in gaming.To address the elephant in the room, Mark Wahlberg is a terrible Max, he looks like he's never played or even heard of the game, and just googled it days before the start of the shootings. In fact, none of the characters work, the script is awful, which speaks volumes since it's based on a video game. They all look confused and don't know what they are doing. Adding the angels wasn't a good idea either, because they bring nothing new to the story, and feel like they were put in there just so they can have something flashy and cool.Maybe the biggest flaw this movie has is the lack of action, which is the opposite of what Max Payne is all about.

So after watching the film, I couldn't help myself feeling quite disappointed, this movie hasn't captured much of feel that the cyber version had given me 5 years ago.First of all, the choice of Max Payne failed. My first choice for this roll would be Clive Owen. Who has played the game wouldn't forget how Max spoke, how he walked and shot. I may like to say Owen would fit in every bit as a Max. His tune, his height and style make me think that he would be born for Max Payne among all his colleagues from the action movie faculty. Mark Wahlberg just should simply try anything else but Max.Second, there are two few bullets. I have expected tons of bullets flying around in all direction every 10 to 15 minutes, and only that can truly remind us of who Max really is. But, quite a pity. Wahlberg preferred to talk rather than fulfill my little desire. Every shooting hasn't lasted long, after three or four rounds of loading, end of the scene. And what was worse was the climax. Every audience has full rights to enjoy an exciting, adrenaline-driving climax in the late part of every action movie. But this movie didn't realized that. Two bad guy were just simply finished by one single bullet. Nearly no hand to hand fight. Haiiiiii. By the way, I am pacifist, maybe the scriptwriter is one too. Pity for an action film.",Max Payne

Well for the movie obviously they control style isn't a problem but unfortunately the very aspects that made the game truly great were lost in the translation to silver screen this movie was boring, stale and completely uncool not to mention the completely whacky and all over the place storyline i will say at times there were breaf glimpes of what could have been but they were way too brief and squandered uselessly this isn't the worste movie but one of the biggest disappointments I've incountered in years they dropped the ball on this big time.

But I liked the movie Hit-man, and I like this.I thought that story should have stuck to the original game better, I also thought there wasn't enough shooting and killing to reflect the game's 600+ kill count. I also think that Max's super-human capabilities should not have been attributed from Valkyr - the original Max Payne seemed to only need ""Pain Killers"" to overcome bodily injury.Where is the ""Inner Circle"" as well.I thought Nolasco's Lupino was good - always happy to see him.Kunis was a mis-cast, she isn't believable in a violent role.I also thought the drug's side effects should have not been in the movie, I wanted to see a UberSoldat on a killing spree, and I didn't think it was fair to the Payne character to attribute the feats from a dug induced haze which clearly has too many initial side-effects, in order for the drug to have been gear up to the degree which is was (well past pilot and into live-trials), it should have worked well then horribly degraded - not give out hallucinations on the first 2 hits.All in all, totally watchable, hot women, enough gun-fu to keep you happy, a decent movie.I hope there a sequel, but hire me as producer/editor/director, I'll make an epic movie.You know from Lord of the Rings it is OK to try and be true to the storyline and it is also OK for the story to be true to course.All the low-life scum creeps who call themselves movie critics by giving this movie an unwatchable review are simply losers who never played the games, don't get film noir and couldn't even make a sucky home movie their families would even want to watch. I'm sick of all the ""highly rated"" trash getting through, and adventurous and alternative stuff like this get crapped on. These critic-losers seem to have either failed out of film-school or are on the payroll for the big budget movies.Long live Max Payne on film!",Max Payne
174,foOki,It looked good...,5,27 October 2008,"Not good, and not horrendous... I think it failed in 4 areas. 1. As film noir, it was dreadful. Dark images do not equal film noir. The script was patchy, and the 'mystery' really wasn't much at all. 2. As an action movie. There wasn't much action (and any that was shown was pretty lame). A slow mo sporadically placed through one of the supposed action sequences made most of the audience laugh unintentionally. The point of a special effect is to enhance, not to make you wonder why it was used. 3. As a game to film conversion... similar to DOA... it was like watching the cut scenes of the game all in one sitting. Minus the fun of playing the game, and the intrigue of the story. Plot holes and game/ action film clichés were unfortunately littered throughout and there didn't seem to be anything in between (ie; a game) to fill the gaps. 4. The acting... there were a lot of actors there that I don't mind watching, but I'm not sure if it was bad direction or just that they were bored that they all came across more wooden than Pinocchio. Olga, Chris and Beau were all highly under utilised (see Iron Man or A History of Violence for how to use small character roles effectively).The only area that worked (and it would seem the only area where anyone actually paid any attention to the game) was visually, it looked great (I'm talking art direction and colour here, not the direction) but in all honesty. That's about it though. Watch if you're bored, if you liked Hit-man or if you thought the visuals of 'The Cell' made up for the rest of the movie.",Max Payne
175,matatosky,I believe in....,5,20 June 2016,"Nothing after seeing this video game adaptation. I am not a gamer. I don't fit the description or the profile. My favorite games are only Grand Theft Auto, Hit-man, Max Payne, the occasional boxing, hockey, wrestling and basketball game. Thats it. Im not going to pretend to base off of the gaming point of view. I've played Max Payne 1 & 2. I've yet to play Max Payne 3, as adulthood has drastically put a damper on my gaming tendencies, but I am guessing it's a solid game like the first 2. The movie was very well expected, even though Mark Wahlberg was lead star. Mark Wahlberg has had a LOT of ranges in different movies, we all know he has presence in front of a camera, but he wouldn't have even been in my top 100 to incarnate a wonderful character like Max Payne. He does not look, act, speak nor even MOVES like the character, which is why critics have panned his performance as terrible, because well....it was a terrible casting choice, ALONG many. Moving on, don't bother playing the game to understand the movie. The plot has been senselessly altered if not eradicated from its original premise and even changing targets at the several villains in the game. The movie shifts from a tale of revenge to war on capitalism by dragging out some scenes that were useless anyway. As I said before, the casting. It's terrible. Worse than Mark Wahlberg, is the fact that they cast Ludicrous (Yes THAT guy) in a role meant for a 50-60 year old man, as it is evident in the game. Now, Im happy for Ludicrous making it big in acting but cmon REALLY!?!? And let's be honest, he's not that good of an actor and his presence here is mildly irritating, especially in such an important role. Mila Kunis is really miscast. Mona Sax, the game version, is a ruthless and yet intelligently seductive assassin that knows how to counteract Max' intense and impulsive behavior. In the movie, Mila tries to make her character seem like that but does not make it happen. The chemistry of the characters in the game is not equally distributed here on screen. I really did want to like the movie, I really, really did, but it just insults its namesake. I bet you a million bucks that if this movie, had been named entitled ANY other name, it wouldve been awesome and I wouldve personally recommended it, but it's name is Max Payne. A beautiful and gripping game turned into a less than mediocre movie. Halfway into the movie, I found myself wondering if I was watching 'Constantine' or Max Payne, and I LOVE Constantine but that's not the direction the movie needed to go. Finally, the ending is pretty weak. It has basically no substance and doesn't give you the fulfillment the ending of the game does. It's just bland. If you're a hardcore gamer, you don't need this film in your life. Play the video game better. If you're looking for dark shoot em ups, watch Smokin Aces. Way better movie, acting and storyline and one of my favorites. I'm not going to say it is a terrible movie, it isn't, but it is a terrible adaptation. I feel completely ashamed that I ever had to say a bad word about Max Payne, but if any had to be said, it would be about this movie.",Max Payne
176,sverrehu,Director gives you the finger,4,24 March 2009,"I just bought the DVD, and after watching the movie I watched the featurettes. As I always do. After a couple of minutes the bearded guy produces the middle man and says: ""You just pirated the movie, didn't you?"" or something like that. I don't like that kind of ""funny"". You hear me, John? That's not funny. The people watching the extras are probably the film geeks who never pirate any movie. Being an arrogant frack doesn't make us buy more of your stuff. Get me?Except for that, I enjoyed the filming, but found the story rather thin. But then, I never liked the games, so I'm probably not qualified to make a statement.",Max Payne
177,MovieMaster95,Put's the Payne name to Shame!,1,2 October 2010,"This film is the perfect example of a cheap Hollywood cash in. Before I saw the film, I had played both games numerous times and loved them for their film noir, graphic novel feel and the amazing third person, slow motion action. And because of my love for the games, I decided to check out the film...What a disappointment. Almost nothing about this film has anything to do with the games. No inner-monologue, no action until the final act, hardly any slow mo (I can remember about 3 instances), Max wasn't the criminal killer he was in the game, Mona was pointless and didn't even use a desert eagle and a sluggish pace.This film won't please anyone. Action fans will hate it's snail like pace, crime thriller fans won't care for the lousy plot and fans of the games will hate the fact it has nothing to do with the game.If there is an upside to this film, it's the stylish film noir look to it but that alone can't save this mess. Even as a standalone film this film suffers from a bad action, a dull plot and uninteresting characters. This film doesn't deserve the name 'Max Payne' nor does it deserve a dime for such a butchered adaption.",Max Payne
178,space_base,Easily the best video game to movie crossover to date.,8,16 October 2008,"I got to see MAX PAYNE a day in advance due to a sneak preview screening at a local theater.And I've got to say... it was impressive to say the least. I consider MAX PAYNE and it's sequel to be my favorite games of all time, and now the movie is the best based on a video game yet produced (though that's not giving it enough credit). Though the film does a few things different, it definitely compliments and stays true to the source material. John Moore, a hack director, turns in his best work to date, delivering some crisp and tense action scenes and most importantly, gets the feel for the game JUST RIGHT. There is also some stunningly gorgeous effects a digitally-altered photography to behold. Mila Kunis was slightly miscast, but Walhberg I feel was a perfect fit to Play Max. It's also good to see Beau Bridges working again, and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges proves once again he's the best rapper-turned-actor since Ice Cube (Boys N the Hood and Three Kings... not the family friendly Ice Cube of recent memory.But the reviews will be terrible. Every time a movie based on a game is released, critics bash it. OK, most of the time it's justified, but here, I can assure you it won't be. Some reviews I've read are straying from the film, and talking about how games shouldn't ever be movies because they have NO emotional impact or artist and creative purpose. A: this is a completely idiotic, false, and ignorant statement, and B: this has nothing to do with the film being reviewed! SHOOT EM UP and WANTED got very strong reviews which they wouldn't have if they were based on games (and they were essential video games!). MAX PAYNE is better than both of those, but will get pummeled critically do to the format it's source material is on. That's just stupid.See this movie with an opened mind. It's a very well crafted modern neo-noir.7.5/10",Max Payne

It doesn't compare favourably to the game.....well, I don't care.Well shot, good coherent direction and good acting. If you're not a gamer don't be put of because this film is based on a game. The action is Marvelesque and has aspects of The Matrix...slowed down action and bullet sequences, maintaining those qualities of realism, grittiness and detail.

180,Moviemanic22,Gothic style suspense movie,6,21 February 2017,"'Max Payne' is the movie adaptation of the infamous computer game. Many critics say it is something which that the movie makers have not ever played or even seen still frames of. I would also honestly admit I have never played it. So I can only give my individual judgement of the movie itself. The movie is about a cop played by Wahlberg who is intent capturing the killers of wife and young child. This is shown in flashback sequence in the middle portion of the movie. From his undercover snitch his is given leads and before he can question them they are killed off. However his partner discovers some information which leads Payne to a pharmaceutical company that his wife was employed for. The reason behind his family's murder forms the latter part of the movie. There is also the role played by Mila Kunis who is after the killer of her sister. The movie is directed by John Moore who is behind the upcoming 'Stephen King' Movie IT and made the 2006 'The Omen' The cinematography is very appropriate with the film. There are many moments that are reminiscent of Frank Miller's 'Sin City'. As a matter of the fact the entire film is shot in that same dark bleached style. The film has good pacing and does not waste time with the plot. Many fans of the game have criticised the film for not being faithful to the game. But I guess it's each to their own. Mark Wahlberg once again hammers loudly at the screen. Unfortunately his emotions are underdeveloped, but plays the role to his best ability. Frankly I feel that this role was too restraining for him. Beau Bridges also gives good support.",Max Payne

I was hoping it would have been a little more believable story line. The film starts out OK but when winged creature's start flying away with people (of course the characters in the film don,t see them) I know this is not what I hoped this film would bee like. I hoped it be a little more realistic. Boy was I wrong Max gets shot at, blows up buildings, jumps into freezing river and never looks worse for wear.

In the end I was quite pleased.Max Payne starts off well, but then starts slowly going downhill with every bad dialog and plot turn. Yet soon after the middle of the film it starts getting better and better and keeps you on the edge of your seat with enjoyable shootout sequences and wonderful performance by Mark Walhberg.The script is clearly awful and cliché, but the direction fills the movie with entertainment that keeps us interested till the end. During the last scene I was praying it wouldn't end badly and luckily it had only a few icky moments.The whole movie is a roller-coaster ride with very bad and occasionally genius moments, so as a whole it's an OK flick, slightly above average. Plus Mark Walhberg's performance, it gets 6 ½ out of 10 stars.",Max Payne
183,Phoenix_e13,had absolutely NOTHING to do with the game!,2,23 October 2008,This movie sucked ass. It should have been a rip off from the game max Payne. Which was a great game! Great story etc.. In the game u work your way up the ladder by killing people. To get to know who killed your family.The only thing matched in this movie was that indeed his family got killed.This movie had really nothing to do with the game max Payne and i was upset when the movie ended. I thought i would go see a great action film with shooting and the FAMOUS slow motion effect (the matrix ripped it of from this game!) That function made the game GREAT. But in the movie we didn't see anything back off this function. The directors reason was... he didn't wanted it to make it look like the Matrix :S What is complete bullsh*t! I mean max Payne invented the slomo effect. So it should be in the movie 2. And i only liked the first matrix ..the other parts sucked. Anyway if the director just had put in this effect and would have worked with the original script of the game this WOULD have been a kick ass movie. Instead.. he chose to make max Payne a complete moron. There were hardly real action scenes.. the chick in the movie who's helping him out has no depth like in we don't know ANYTHING ..like who is she? And where does she go or end up after saving max ass in the end??Then there were angel soldiers?.. they looked really cool and think these demons would look great in a new Spawn movie! but it had nothing really to do with the story of max Payne. OK..So lets get this together:1) didn't come close to the story of the game 2) No bullit time in the game 3) hardly any action 4) missing info about the characters 5) angels? people on drugs?..terrible story.If you haven't played max Payne some parts would not seem to matter.. but still it has a bad story and the movie was boring way to less action.,Max Payne

There are no supernatural beings in the video game. This was a very sad attempt at this film. I personally think it only made it theaters because of Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis.

185,Scarlet_Syndicate,Payneful adaptation of a great video game,3,11 February 2012,"Let me just start off by saying i'm a huge fan of the games and when I saw this,I expected it to be at least a little similar. I'm sad to say I was extremely disappointed.Obviously the film couldn't have ALL the action scenes in the game because that would've made it more boring than it was already, but a few wouldn't have hurt. As far as I could tell, not many were used and the complete lack of bullet time in this film put it to shame. That was one of the main themes of the video game.Also the locations they used in the film varied differently to the game too and the adaptation of the storyline was plain awful. Did any of the people on this set even play the game or just read the back of the box and go from there? the reason I gave it three stars are for the casting which I thought was fairly good,the weather (is that even worth a star?)Well at least they got the snowing part right, and the mythology which they kept in the film.Furthermore, with the lack of plot, how many characters did they miss out? quite a lot I'd say. Where was Gognitti or Woden? They were great characters! It all pretty much centered around Max' battle with Lupino. Which kinda sucked as he died in the first part of the game.Okay so Mark Wahlberg did quite a good job but he never managed to fully portray the whole Max Payne kinda vibe. Or that may have been down to the director. You never really got chance to know him apart from a few flashbacks to his wife and child(which personally I thought were quite good) And, dude, where did the monologues go? they practically made the game! All in all, if you're a fan of the game I would advise not watching this film as chances are you will come out severely disappointed at the terrible adaptation.If you haven't played the game before then I still advise not watching this film as chances are you will come out severely disappointed at the lack of, well, pretty much everything.Now all I have to do is wait for someone to come along and remake this film into better one...",Max Payne

Inexcusablely lazy cash in.,1,10 November 2012,"It's as if the setting, characters, story, tone and events of the artwork (and Max Payne, the game series, is a passionate work of art) that made this movie possible were turned into pieces in some kind of movie construction set for toddlers. A group of toddlers then, with all the inexperience, ineptitude and unbelievable gall (to not have even BOTHERED to check the source material for all of the hallmarks which made it stand alone in the first place) scattered the pieces all over the screen. Some of the pieces had their head chewed on, others broke in the dash, some were lost under the couch and what remained was the stilted, pointless, sporadic mess that we have been served. Give ME the budget. Let ME tell the story. I just hope that Hollywood sees that there is more money to be made by telling a good story that is true to the source material, written and directed by the enthused likes of Joss Whedon, Peter Jackson or Christopher Nolan and subsequently producing films like The Avengers, the recent Batman trilogy and as I have just seen, Dredd. This film would be an incomprehensible bore for the Max Payne uninitiated and for the fan of what is surely one of the great video game trilogies, a terrible tragedy that we will more than likely now not see a true big screen adaptation worthy of the franchise.

187,iambrdy,"Don't waste your money, it's one of the worst films made this year",1,19 October 2008,"Oh Max Payne What unfortunate series of events were put into motion to make you such a bad film?First, the writing; knowing full well that is a movie adapted from a video game that is derivative of other films. However, as a popcorn flick, you don't expect to be challenged mentally, you see it to get your violently happy smile on. That's it. It's a simple escapist pleasure to see a movie that's dumb, but fun. The formula is that simple. Shed those completely unnecessary layers that may slow down the action and instead insert bravado into the spots between the action scenes. Crank is a good example, there's very little to that movie aside from stay hyper and kick ass.So the first problem with Max Payne is heavy handed and droning attempt to develop a two dimensional character Why? It's not like Max Payne needs a lot of development, he's a dude with a vengeance on, shut up and let it happen. Instead you're walked through all of these really bad scenes filled wit the worst dialogue put to page. It's like watching soft-core blue movies without a nut to bust. That's just the first 20 minutes. The movie continues, but first let me tell you how they open the film, because it really set the bar for the rest of really badness of it all.We open on a man walking down a hallway towards a door cracked open and light bleeding through it A baby is crying in the distance. The man moves closer to the door and on that door a big sign reading ""Baby"" is hung on it. First off, I ma not sure why, if they're assuming that an audience is that dumb; they didn't just put a big old title on the screen, or put an interpreter up there to point and say ""Hey, there's an Freakin' BABY in there!"" I know it ties with the video game, but this is an adaptation, some changes for the sake of not raping the audience's intelligence have to be made. And, believe me, it doesn't stop there, the film is filled with some of the most heavy handed art direction, really bad sound design and some of the worst editing I've seen since Live Free Die Hard. It's that bad.Later on in the film Max and the Mila Kunis playing a Russian girl supposed to move plot, but ultimately becomes a tragic and unfulfilled, unresolved and disjointed piece of the movie; well they stop into a goth tattoo parlor, where they go through a catalogue of tattoo's and stop on the reoccurring one they see. They question the proprietor and at the drop of the dime he pulls out an old book about Norwegian mythology and starts talking about Valkyrie's, the symbol and the significance of the mark/tattoo. This brief wikipedia presentation ends with such a blatant inconsistency with Mark Walberg/Max Payne asking one more question and then the shop proprietor responding with a really big and dumb ""Huh?"" So in one single turn he goes from Mythology and theology expert into dumb goth guy. The movie spends so much time building to a conflict, but without any tension, just trivial scene after scene.There were points in the movie that we were really laughing, but they really weren't supposed to be funny. Dramatic tension was the goal, but the exact opposite occurred. In particular Mila Kunis talking to Max about how much of a dark time bomb he is. The dialogue is SO poorly written that the scene becomes comedic.Beau Bridges line in the end is also laughably bad.Other miserable notes Chris O'Donnell, Yep, bad.Nelly Furtado's cameo Was one of the most laughably bad moments on the screen and the first shot of Ludicrous, was also really funny. Like, really, really funny.I guess some things that should have been aborted are born, and Max Payne is one that is prospering. Which is really unfortunate.",Max Payne
188,Faizan,"Revenge is a dish best served cold, but ""Max Payne"" feels dead on arrival",1,15 October 2008,"You'd be forgiven for mistaking ""Max Payne"" as being an extended episode of one of the many TV legal dramas, except set in Sin City. It's actually New York, but I doubt anyone watching it would really care. Just like they wouldn't care who Max Payne is in the movie or why he's on a mission to find the man responsible for his family's murder. Revenge is a dish best served cold, yes, but ""Max Payne"" feels dead on arrival.Like an angry, younger Lieutenant Columbo (another TV reference!), Mark Wahlberg as Payne prowls the streets and alleys trailing long shadows behind him. The film is based on a video game, but feels like it was based on a lullaby or is itself a video game being played out. Actually, that last analogy would be an insult to the original game which, ironic as it is, was modeled after Hong Kong movies and in particular, the now overused bullet time sequences from ""Matrix"". The games other defining factor was its dark, sarcastic, extremely quotable first person narration, which were as eloquent as they were witty.Very little of both is found in the film, and that isn't close to being its main problem. What the movie seems to have somehow done is arranged the games many sporadic plots and threads into an incoherent, disengaged whodunit. It is so focused on telling its story that there are about half a dozen flashbacks to the murder of Payne's wife alone, none of which create the empathy they aim for. Forgetting that games are popular not necessarily for their stories, just like comic books aren't necessarily championed for their thematic depth or literary impact, the film ends up turning into an enduring punishment, one that lasts as long as the duration of the film.",Max Payne
189,hugoruneofbrentford,Dead from the moment Wahlberg was cast,4,8 March 2021,"The role of Max Payne, even if taken completely separately from the popular games, is one that requires an actor of extraordinary intensity.
Wahlberg is a charisma vacuum with little talent and totally miscast in the title role.
His tough guy act is as convincing as Cain Dingle's on Emmerdale. I was never able to get involved in the film because of his terrible performance.
There are other problems with the film of course. It seems to have little if any resemblance to the game.
The pacing is awful and the director can't do action sequences to save his life.
Its a shame because there are some good elements. When Wahlberg isn't onscreen the movie picks up dramatically.
Olga Kurylenko is a bonus and most of the rest of the cast aquit themselves admirably but with Wahlberg being a walking plank and the fact that no one involved seems to know or care why the games are so popular it's all a waste of time.",Max Payne

191,olesd,Pain to the Max,6,21 January 2009,"Dreadful. Not because it wasn't a smooth transition between game and film, but because it seemed like no one was trying. The visuals are so stylized they're boring at worst and at best look like a rip off of Sin City. Max is totally un-relatable and un-likable as the center piece and his sob story is told so tritely you can't manage to care. All the odd choices for transition (black Bravura, Alex is a bagman, Mona is Russian, Valkyr is blue...etc) don't do anything to enhance the story, instead quite the opposite they remove all the firmly established characters from the game completely, leaving behind hollow and uninteresting replacements. The movie is also really boring since the only action occurs at the end and then it's so silly and small scale it does nothing to make up for hours and hours of doing nothing. There's a scene where we see the storage factory Max stops by is called 'Gonitti's Storage'. I thought this meant we'd see Vinnie Gognitti from the game. Nope. It's just an in joke, hollow and unsatisfying and barely planned out. Like this entire film. Hit-man was better then this.

192,dondanhernandez,The best adaption so far,8,21 October 2008,"So Max Payne wasn't sheer perfection like I wanted. But still give the movie credit, it takes the darkness and grit from the game and uses it to full perfection for the movie. There were a lot of missing elements but we can't expect a perfect adaptation of a video game, I mean I would have loved to see it resemble the game a little more closely but what they did was good enough for me. The plot was far better than those of the standard vid game movie and the acting and characters were more rounded and not as flat as say Alice was in the Resident Evil movies.Mark Wahlberg plays a great Max Payne and any doubts for me were dropped the moment the film started, he brings Max to life and yeah I miss the old smiley constipated Sam Lake version of Max with James McCaffrey's voice but Mark makes it work. Mila Kunis proves her ability to act though she was miscast she doesn't fit the femme fatale role of Mona and Ludicrous playing Jim Bravura wasn't exactly that bad, his music sucks but his acting is pretty decent. The rest of the cast do what they need to and say their lines fine.Also the style the film was shot in was stylistic and entertaining to watch every scene was sheer poetry.All in all it wasn't horrible and has proved itself a better adaptation than the other video game movies we have out.",Max Payne
193,Dan-121,Visually sumptuous and atmospheric,8,21 October 2008,"Despite a lack of ambition on the filmmakers' part, Max Payne is a serviceable action movie with glimpses of brilliance. If only the filmmakers had set their bar higher.In a nutshell, the story deals with Max's search for justice for his slain wife and child. The classic plot elements of love, lost and betrayal make this story of an avenging outcast engaging. The emotionally resonant and visually poetic closing scenes are also particularly affecting. A noteworthy aspect of the movie is the use of imagery, from the subtle contrasting effect of gently drifting snow over emotional undercurrents to the jarring drug-induced hallucinations. The constant snowfall and rain, dark-hued color palette coupled with a menacing soundtrack add to the moody atmosphere that befits the tone of the subject matter.There are also well choreographed action scenes that accelerate the movie to its ending. The initial gunfight in the Aesir office is spectacular. The movie works, in no small part, due to Mark Wahlberg's convincing portrayal of the title character. The other characters have mostly limited screen time but are satisfactorily portrayed as well.However, there are negatives to counter the positives. The movie attempts to weave mystery and intrigue into the storyline with mixed results. On one hand, the additional back story adds more depth to the characters. On the other hand, the subplots feel somewhat inconsequential or unnecessary. This inevitably affects the pacing of the movie resulting in the perceived slowness in story development. Also, the abrupt nature of the ending leaves much to be desired. Furthermore, considering its source material, the action scenes are limited and somewhat muted.All in all, I ended up liking Max Payne. It is not a bad movie. It is just one that does not aspire to transcend its source material, which is a shame, because it has all the elements for a truly great film.8/10",Max Payne
194,Faisal-Hashmi,Good looking but empty and disappointing movie.,6,16 October 2008,"Whatever way you look at it, Max Payne disappoints. A movie that was marketed as a complete action movie which was also based on an action game is actually a dull and bland mystery movie with elements of action embedded.On of the reasons for that is the first half. Given the premise of the movie - A detective looking for revenge of his family's murder - the first half is incredibly boring and devoid of any suspense or tension. All we get is either cops talking about Max Payne and his past, or a very sorry-looking Max Payne going about the city looking for clues in very disjointed and badly edited sequences. Nothing important happens as all we get is exposition and introduction of unnecessary characters.Speaking of unnecessary characters, played by Ludicrous was a very useless character and didn't have any use in the story other than for flashbacks which should have been removed. Olyga Kurenko is also a forgettable character that was included only for sex appeal.Another reason is the plot issues. Without spoiling anything, the plot feels disjointed and doesn't tie up in the end as many questions remain unanswered. The ending is also very abrupt and unsatisfying.The saving graces of the movie are the visuals and the final act. John Moore has succeeded in giving the film a noir look which is beautiful. The final act of the movie is the only place where you will find all the trailer action moments. They look amazing and this is the act where the story is actually moving forward to a finale.Overall, Max Payne isn't a very bad movie. It's just disappoints given it's premise and source material.",Max Payne
195,rlsalgad,the non gamer point of view,6,9 January 2009,"the movie is not bad at all if you haven't played the game, the mayor part of the criticism points to important characters to the game being left out or being of little importance in the movie, and, well, is nothing that can worry a person who has never played max Payne, so... whatever. the movie is entertaining, even though it makes no sense in a lot of moments, the characters was completely flat and undeveloped, and you can guess who are the bad guys since the first shot in that they appear. but, despite the fact that this is not an smart movie, all that lacks in the smartness department is compensated in the coolness area. nice effects, cool action scenes, great photography... cool movie... dumb, but cool. fun to watch, unlikely to be re-watched.",Max Payne
196,FrankG47,All how NOT to make a video game into a movie.,1,17 September 2011,"It's hard to really sit and watch a film that is made entirely from a successful video game. Though it has happened, it's also had a huge back lash when the video game script gets re-written and is never correct.Max Payne, the video game was a dark game that appealed to the player for it's comic book pace story telling, and it kept a very detailed storyline that was just like classic film noir suspense.There was NO NEED AT ALL to re-write the script to the video game. It's script was almost like a film, and with a good director could have been easily transferred to film. Why Hollywood feels the need to ruin books was always a mystery, but yes they also ruin good video games, and this was not the first one (Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia) The character of Max Payne was terribly re-written. In the video game you have an angry renegade fugitive cop that just pulls the trigger without question. There isn't a whole lot of screaming and big emotion. Hard to blame Whalberg on that when the script was totally re-written.This is how the movie should have happened, and how the video game follows.A New York cop comes home to find his wife and daughter brutally murdered from thugs using a drug called Valkyrie; V. After the funeral he goes undercover for the DEA.After the big break that traces the drug to a mafia family, he is framed for the murder of his partner and goes on a killing spree trying to figure out the entire case all by himself, and successfully does.In the film what we get is the characters thrown around in different locations and doing odd things, and some who's characters are totally re-written.First off let's start with the character of Mona Sax In the video game she was the sister of Lisa Sax (changed to Natasha Sax in the film), whom was the wife of Don Angelo Punchinello; head of the ""worst mafia family in New York"". Mona refers to herself as ""Lisa's evil twin.In the film she is a Russian assassin. They had to re-write the Femme Fatale character to not even fit the original story.In the film we get a detective story that makes no sense at all, riddled with plot holes, and things that make you say ""Why did they go through all this trouble making a film for a video game they could have just EASILY used the script for?"" I am a bit biased because I have played the video game, but in this case I can be. This film is the worst game-to-movie transition ever.",Max Payne
197,Syntax_Terror,strongly urging you NOT to see this film,1,28 October 2008,"""I don't believe in angels, but I believe in pain..."" Those opening lines of the movie can only mean one thing, trite bull****. I don't know what the people over at Fox Studios were doing when the subject of making a movie out of one of the best shoot 'em up, film noir inspired, and heart racing video game franchises came up for discussion. It certainly wasn't ""Hey, we should play the game to see what this thing is all about."" Nope. It was more like ""Hey! This game made a lot of money. Someone quickly tell me what the back of the box says about the game and we'll write a crappy screenplay around it and miscast the whole thing."" Mark Wahlberg plays Max Payne, the brutal, no holds barred and out for revenge cop from the video game of the same name... but wait! They rewrote nearly the whole character. He couldn't seem to give a rats ass about his murdered wife and child except for a few bland flashbacks. The acting is so misplaced and frozen in this movie and adding the likes of Mila Kunis, Chris O'Donnell, Ludicrous (holy crap what were they thinking?), and Beau Bridges didn't really give them much of a leg to stand on.To sum it all up, I felt like falling asleep during the film (a feat not so easily accomplished for me). This was an action movie turned into a long boring drama with a few shooting sequences.Don't waste your money. Rent 'Shoot Em Up' instead",Max Payne
198,Mr. Man-3,From a die hard fan: this is a terrible film,1,19 October 2008,"I've had the pleasure of beating both Max Payne 1 and 2, so let us start this off by saying I like the games a great deal. At the very least I expected a dumb, entertaining action film. What I was shocked to find was a film so poorly made I am impressed that Mr. Moore actually put his name on the credits.In the games Max is pushed over the edge and goes on a rampage of survival and revenge. He works his way up from person to person and every once in awhile, he has crazy dream sequences. Throughout there is a dry wit and extremely overdone noir dialog. It's so over the top, it's hard not to like.I have no idea why the filmmakers chose not to follow that fairly basic plot setup because the replacement is absolutely horrific. The movie wobbles from scene to scene, alternating from making no sense at all to making Max and every other character in the movie look like complete morons.What's further astounding is that the film can't even get the basics down. This is the worst directed film I've seen in over a year. It's pretty but the action is sparse and boring. Conversations are so badly shot it's no wonder that the whole theater was laughing at most of the scenes. At least one actor turns in a performance so stiff he should be declared legally dead.And as for the 'staying true to the game' part? Well, they had some slow motion shots, but beyond that, all the style, humor, and over the top action is missing.Alright, I'm done. I still can't believe the film was that bad. Oy!",Max Payne
199,cericsso,Lots of Payne. No Gain.,5,19 April 2009,"Reviewing movies based on video games is always a bit tricky. On the one side, you need to consider the movie as a separate entity, a movie in itself, just like when reviewing any other movie. But then again, like the past has shown us, game-based movies are hardly even close to ""regular movies"" in quality, and as such, they'd all be completely crushed in reviews. So, maybe the only way to be fair and objective, is to look at it from a gamer's perspective.I remember back in 2001 when Finnish Remedy Entertainment finally released ""Max Payne"" on PC, to much hyping and a rigorous marketing campaign. And man, was it a blast! Combining all the elements of neo noir and renegade cop movies with a nice plot line and excellent graphics, the game just rocked (as a matter of fact, still does!). And even though I was very skeptical of a sequel, I have to admit, ""Max Payne 2"", launched in 2003, blew the roof out. So, there's my baseline. Now, I've never been a fan of game-movies, quite the opposite, in fact. I also felt it all along, that a movie adaptation of this franchise would end badly. But still, the fan in me just couldn't resist checking it out when the DVD was released.As a cinematic adaptation, ""Max Payne"" is actually not that bad. Taking the basic elements of the games' plot line and twisting it up to add some dramatic value, it actually manages to hold on to it's core without falling apart TOO badly. And, in accordance with the games and their nature, there's action and violence galore (though very clearly, director John Moore has chosen a PG-13 approach), and it looks good. I would even dare call it beautiful. The overall visual effects and camera work is also nicely done, with some clear references to the games. I must also applaud the movie for not overusing the bullet-time effect too much. Since the ""Max Payne"" games were the first to implement free bullet-time in games, it would have been easy to use them too liberally here. And after ""The Matrix"", this seems to be the dogma of action movies these days. Casting was also good, even though I was a bit surprised to see that many A-list actors for a movie of this caliber. Contrary to fans' objections, Mark Wahlberg as Max Payne still turned out pretty nice, even though Dignam (from ""The Departed"") still rocks a bit harder. I do however feel a bit sad for Olga Kurylenko, whose only role in the pasts, except ""Quantum of Solace"", have been rather meaningless.But, for all it's worth, ""Max Payne"" still leaves a lot missing. First and foremost, adapting a game based on previous movies, into a movie just doesn't really turn out good. It felt more like watching a re-run of all the elements that made the games good. The problem is, nowadays, they've all been done, and in a time where mediocre movies are a dime a dozen, ""Max Payne"" just doesn't stand out. And the fact is, there are some characters involved that don't drive the storyline in any way, rather making it messy. So all in all, the movie adaptation of ""Max Payne"" feels more like an attempt to make the game fans happy by keeping all the elements, but doesn't make the movie-fans any luckier.",Max Payne
200,jmarinko-1,Mr. Moore does a fairly good job of adapting the cinematic aspects of first-person shooter games back into cinema,5,25 October 2008,"I think it was when bursts of flame filled the Manhattan night and giant winged creatures smacked against skyscraper windows like bugs on windshields that I began to lose the narrative thread of ""Max Payne,"" a somber, stylized new action movie derived from a video game.Up until then it seemed more or less clear. Some people had wings tattooed on their arms, and they all seemed to be hooked on a blue liquid developed by a pharmaceutical company where the hero's wife worked before she was murdered, along with their child, by some people with wings tattooed on their arms. The weather in New York alternated between fluttering snow and driving rain, and every time someone fired a gun the images slowed down and the sound mix cleared out so you could hear the plink of a bullet casing as it hit the ground. Meanwhile, Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is an action hero so melancholy that he can't even muster a quotable catchphrase.Which gives ""Max Payne,"" directed by John Moore from a script by Beau Thorne, a measure of integrity. It's not an especially good movie, but such a judgment is not really relevant to its ambitions. It is content to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of a familiar range of sensations, some of which almost rise to the level of feelings. Though a sexy woman in a skimpy dress (next-wave Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko) shows up to tempt Max, lust is not really on the menu. Instead, the film's momentum is derived from the grim, ruthless self-pity of the lone avenger.Max Payne, a solo shooter moving through hallways, alleys and empty rooms, is a figure handed down from movies to video games and nowadays, increasingly, handed back. Mr. Moore does a fairly good job of adapting the cinematic aspects of first-person shooter games back into cinema, and in devising a coherent color scheme and sound design for Max's escapades.A coherent story would be a lot to ask, and would in any case slow down the movie's rhythm. Max's righteous anger finds various allies and targets, though it is not always clear who is which. They are played by Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges and Ludicrous with just enough panache and expressiveness to uphold the (increasingly irrelevant) distinction between a movie and a video game.""Max Payne"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The brutal violence has been cleansed of blood, the swearing avoids the really bad words and when Ms. Kurylenko is topless she is filmed from the back.",Max Payne
201,dino_saur333,Needs more shooting,6,26 October 2008,"Let me start of by saying that if you've played of the game (either the original or the sequel or both) and you loved the game (and you probably did) do your best not to come to the movie with...too much expectations.I myself have finished both games and loved them. I was pretty excited when news of the movie popped up on one of my RSS feeds. So I watched it the first opportunity I got. The movie didn't disappoint me but at the same time it left me wanting. By the end of it I was like ""That's it?"" Looking at the games you expect a lot of shooting. Not just ""Once upon a time in Mexico"" amount of shooting. I'm talking about ""Rambo"" x6 amount of shooting. And in this movie there was just not enough shooting. However I do think the filmmakers did a fine enough job in making the few shooting scenes in the movie pretty cool.My biggest complain is with the main Character. Mark Wahlberg should've at least played the game to get a feel for Max but he didn't (according to the trivia section) and that's a big blunder in my book. If your playing an established character you need to study said character. If he did, maybe he would've done more shooting.In the games Max is driven by revenge into a long and painful downward spiral into the depths of the underworld due to the murder of his wife and daughter. He is so consumed that he does not stop even in the face of death and dishonor and becomes a one man army. In the movie the motives are the same but Wahlberg's Max seemed...tamed compared to the game. in the movie Max seemed emulating some old 80's detective while ought to be more of a no-holds-barred, loose-cannon, cowboy. Maybe he just didn't do enough shooting.Lastly, i just don't like how they added all these extra main characters to the story. Sure some of them were necessary but the Movie should've focused on the few main characters. That's one of the things that made the game great. You only follow the stories of the people who matter to the story. I don't like the new characters because they replace the roles of the game Characters. The major villain in the game was featured in the movie but the role of that character was severely underplayed and spread across several other characters. Not good. The filmmakers just ruined a character I loved to hate from the game.All in all, a not so bad movie. It resembles the game in story and feel enough that it's still familiar to fans of the game. The action is pretty good, the cinematography is very good, and the direction is also good.In the end of it all, the movie just needs more characterization a darker feel...and lots more shooting",Max Payne
202,seanbreeden,I want my time back,3,24 January 2009,"One of the truly bad movies I have ever seen. I have loved everything Mark Wahlberg has done until now. MAYBE if you are a hard core Max Payne fan then you will like this movie, but for me it was slow.... very slow. I would love to get my time back that I spent watching this movie. There were some really good actors in the movie but the plot was thin and the movie just seemed to drag on forever.If you have seen every other movie out there and just want something to watch, or if you are a big fan of the game, then this may be a good pick for you. For me, I wish I had selected something else.Mila Kunis was super hot in it though.",Max Payne
203,stee_nolan,The Slating that this movie got was unnecessary...,8,18 June 2009,"Max Payne surprised me. I struggle to watch movies based on video games. Doom and Resident Evil are prime examples of failures and Halo doesn't look so promising. Max Payne delivered as competently as Ed Norton's version of the Incredible Hulk. It's dark gloomy theme reminded me so much of the video game that I was almost about to jump up and grab my old PS2 and hook it up to the system. Mark Wahlberg cut the ice in his portrayal of Max Payne when I really honestly did not expect him to. He slipped out of character quite noticeably from time to time, but hey, it's never easy to play such a consistently mysterious character on a consistent basis.I plainly do not understand how people have analyzed this movie down to the point of where they come out with the opinion that it's embarrassing to watch. In a whole, this film is most definitely not a mortifying experience. It does not set a landmark in movie making but really, nowadays, does any movie do that? Max Payne more or less fulfills the fantastic experience that I personally had with the Video Game. So what if it's a bit of a cheesy movie... wasn't the video game a bit cheesy? Now I don't want to fly into an argumentative state of play but what does this movie not have that the video game has? Perhaps your reaching for a controller to play the movie but Mark Wahlberg isn't quite doing what you tell him? This movie will probably remain unsung due to it's negative publicity but I will applaud it and will welcome the sequel with open arms.Overall Rating:A solid, positive 8/10",Max Payne
204,Zohaib_Author,"The Game, The Movie...Its Awesome",10,16 August 2020,"I have been a fan of the Max Payne Game and have played part 1 and 2 multiple times. When this movie came out i was really excited. It was difficult to understand the movie at first because it was slightly different from the game but after watching few times, i understood the story. What i absolutely love was the way this movie was filmed. The best thing about this movie is Mark Wahlberg. It was his best acting ever however it remains for some reasons underrated. But for me it was Mark's best acting ever. I have loved this movie when it came out and I love this movie today.",Max Payne
205,killer3000ad,"Boring as hell, wait for it to air on free TV.",2,16 October 2008,"I only ever played the first game but I came into the cinema expecting much shooting and bullet time mayhem. Boy was I in for a major disappointment. Max Payne has to be the second worst movie adaptation of a computer game after Dungeon Siege. It's so boring and slow that you could take five toilet breaks in the first two thirds of the movie and still not miss anything. It's just that boring. The action in the end probably only amounts to 12-15 mins of the total movie length. There's only three or four bullet time sequences in the whole movie and that's about the only entertaining part of it because the none bullet time action sequences are poorly choreographed and bland. There are a lot of useless characters like Bravura and Mona Sax, whom if you completely removed them from the movie, the plot would not suffer at all.The movie in my opinion is both improperly marketed and written as it comes off as gritty detective crime drama rather than the bullet time action filled game that it is based on. It doesn't help that in Australia the movie posters scream that it is 2008's Sin City. If you played the games and loved them, I suggest staying away from this as it will ruin your experience. If you don't know anything about the games, well then you might be entertained a bit. Were this movie marketed as an urban crime drama and NOT based on an action game where the hero goes from level to level mowing down enemies, it probably would be more accurate because that's what this movie really is, a gritty urban crime drama with a very slow and long build up to the ending. But hey if that's your cup of cake then fans of such genre would enjoy this snoozefest. But as a fan of the game whose main selling point was the Matrix-like bullet time action, it fails... badly.",Max Payne

The other half was concentrated TOO much on secondary characters (which was not needed...title of the movie is max payne) on the bright side however, ludicrous did a decent job and was actually semi-likable in the role. The compositing and VFX were very well done as well by SpinVFX it seems also in Toronto. Camera work is very good as well and pulls you in. The whole look of the film is great, sets and locations especially.The problem overall is however not enough action (for a movie based on a shooting game), not enough darkness in it (whichever executive had his hands in the PG13 rating should be fired...still hoping for an R rated DVD/BD release), some but not all characters were good and lastly....where is the MONOLOGUE? Half the game is Max Payne ""talking""...you're INSIDE his mind as flashes of comic book pages go by with grim winter storms and New York with blood red skies in the background.Bad decisions, a rushed production perhaps and i wish i wouldn't blame the director for this because it seems his hand might have been forced one way instead of the other but this JUST barely makes the grade as an okay movie for theater release.If you're a fan, go see it, its the closest we'll ever get to a grade A movie done. If you've never heard of it, you can skip it.",Max Payne
207,nthrooch,"Idiotic, disjointed insult to the name, Payne.",2,23 November 2008,"Having played both titles in the past, the second I heard of this film, I was almost instantly hesitant. Game to film conversions never run smooth at the best of times, by majority due to their insistence on changing everything that people like, to separate it from the source material. The crazy thing here, is that this film doesn't betray the original storyline to a great degree, but in doing so comes up even worse than if it had.There are two major problems with Max Payne. The first, is the tremendous number of errors in the film. Spoilers abound here people, so skip these two paragraphs if you're yet to see this atrocity. Consider this, in the game, the drug Valkire is intravenous. As a result, the graffiti peppered all over the city is of a large V with a needle on it. Max Payne the movie decided to keep this graffiti, only the drug was now a drink. So throughout the movie, characters are popping the stuff like Bacardi breezer's, and yet still the graffiti contains a needle.It's just one of numerous idiotic flaws in an already ruined story. Why is Mona never seen without an MP5, as if she can just wander the streets of New York carrying it like a handbag? Why is it she stipulates ""you know what I do"" to Max when at this point he is still very much unaware of her existence? Why is it that a breaching charge from a SWAT team can not only knock out a door, but utterly disintegrate a clearly heavy filing cabinet holding it shut?This film completely misses the mark in both continuity and story. The original story of Max Payne is left utterly gaunt with the removal of key aspects, like Mona's sister being a twin. Like Jim Bravura being a bastard hunting Max, not an ignorant, sitting idly by hoping to see him. And don't even get me started on the reasonless race change for ol' Jim. It seems the in thing these days to take a white character and swap him out with no justification. Yes, I'm talking to you Kingpin from Daredevil.Needless to say both me and my brother left utterly disappointed. Me, a long time fan of the series, him, a regular movie goer. This film disappoints both, and is absolutely to blame for it's own demise. Poor directing, complete ignorance of source material, and an overall failure to deliver what could have been the western Hard Boiled. A must-miss.",Max Payne
208,vito7,could have been worse,6,16 November 2008,"Well if you can still be entertained by relentless gunfire (though some fans of the game may not feel there is enough of it of slo mo scenes) then you might not hate this movie. The plot is the basic 'they killed the cops wife so he'll settle the score by any means' setup. And when all you have to support it is automatic weapons it's hard to breath new life into such a familiar script. Considering that, they really didn't do such a bad job. The drug hallucinations of black angels and raging infernos did add a little flare to the shootouts and the incessant darkness did set the proper mood for the film. I admit that my not expecting much going in may have lead me to give this film what some might consider a generous mediocre rating, but if you know going in that you're getting the 'Dirty Harry style, the cop will kill everyone so the authorities will have to except the last man standings explanation' type of movies, it's not so bad. I have definitely noticed over the years that in these Stallone, Van Dam, Segal etc. movies that the author seems to think that since he has shown us who the bad guy is that the good guy is free to shoot them without the burden of having proof to show everyone after the blaze is over. But ah well, it's one of those types of movies and for what it is it could have been worse. Save it for video or better yet cable.Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html",Max Payne

It made harks back to the john woo action films such as hard boiled and implemented the bullet time stop motion gun play of the matrix.The film. Well. ITS AWESOME. Its got guns, extreme stunts, a good cast. oh and Olga freaking kurylenko. I mean hot isn't even half the word. Mark Wahlberg is usually the hard ass cop anyway so he was the obvious choice and while he plays more the hard faced actioner rather than the foreboding logical character that is max in the games his performance as that persona fits the dark edgy mood that is brought in straight from the games.the only criticism is that the implementation of the Angels must have seemed like a good idea at the time seems somehow out of place and the reason that they are present is so outlandishly stupid it seems out of place but whilst the idea is wrongfully placed it at least adds a great incentive for the mystery to remain being studied and keeps the viewers intrigued.In short its a good proper action film big on brawn but surprisingly its got brains too. mind you the balance is a bit off but still it makes good viewing.

Only once in a great while you see a glimpse of what he is thinking and what his pain is. The end of the film was so moving to me I almost cried, I felt his Pain and it was deep.

Never had a sole action game had such a dramatic and sad story of the character you play as.When it comes to the story...it is a bit confusing to understand what is really going on in the beginning, but it really picks up as the story continues. I admit the movie could use more action scenes, but when it came to the action...it was intense and satisfying (there is an action scene that I cannot stop playing over and over again).The reason you make a movie of a game is to bring the great story to people who don't play video games, and that is exactly what they did.Last of all, if you liked the movie ""Taking Lives"" and the visuals from ""Sin City"" you'll love this movie.

212,Prikolist,"Good movie, wrong title",1,26 October 2008,"I'll say that's it's an enjoyable shooter with pretty special effects, to which I would ordinarily give an 8 or 9 easily. However, they decided to call it Max Payne. I have guesses for how the script was written. The writer was given a two-paragraph summary of the game, he crossed out one, changed the other, and added paragraph of his own. And probably saw a screenshot or two to get the mood. Wait, wait, I know - the writer was just shown the retail box the game came in, they usually have a little concept art, a couple screenshots, a short intro to the plot and game features. That must be it, because the only things linking the movie to the games are the character and place names, death of Max's family, shots of snowy Manhattan, and the drug. Sadly, this is yet another utterly failed attempt at a video-game-based-movie. In my opinion it is due to completely discarding often brilliant story lines, which besides obvious damage to the movie also alienates the fans who should be the main target audience. I understand there needs to be some major cutting and writers just love reworking things, but it should be done on the scale it was done in Lord Of The Rings, not like this. If I merely recorded actual gameplay and then cut it as a movie it would be more pleasant to watch. Now I'm sure there will be many people reading this that are unfamiliar with the Max Payne franchise, in that case if you like good action movies - go see this one, you'll enjoy it. As a Max Payne fan though I can't give this movie above a 6. I think the point that killed it was when I realized that they combined Vlad and Mona into one character. Ugh.

Max Payne as computer game gave to the world the first off-the edge bullet time,which was one of the most or maybe the biggest innovation that entered the action genre. Sure, it was copied from the ""Matrix"", but who caries, since you have the chance to smash, shoot and kill everything you see in a slow, and elegant way.But the script of the movie was the most important spice of the whole recipe for a great game. It' dark atmosphere, the cold snow, that was pouring over New York city, the dialogs, the salvation that Payne was seeking-amazing! So, I've entered the cinema, with hopes and dreams to see how this character will step up into the big screen. And i was bored to death! Payne was Robocop, or is Robocop Payne? The actor was dodging bullets, killing enemies without aiming(which is normal,of course) etc. But the biggest disappointment of all was not the awfully confusing script, rather then our champion of the night- the fighting scene. Or is there actually any scene that was even connecting with a fight? I was waiting to see how the main character with stand up and battle not just with his demons, but with the enemy,the murder that made his life a nightmare, but in return I've watched a gun firing bullet and.... the end! :) Now that's what I call a real action! Since I've criticized every point of this movie, logically I should know turn the coin and say something positive, give a light into the tunnel of darkness shame, and dumbness. Well, the film ended, which is a good thing, the credits were good, there were no spelling mistakes and..uh that's all.In conclusion, my review of this movie is maybe way too emotional and the users may not accepted as accurate statement, so I owe you an apology, but I am fan, that wanted to see Payne as a ordinary cop, that has no super powers, to deal with his problems, to fight with his nightmares of his murdered family and in the end find his salvation. But in the end I've received a dramatic climate change-from snow to sun.",Max Payne
215,Movie_BUFF007,Totally MAX PAIN!!,4,15 January 2009,"It's so hard to see a film like this. I've played the game and thought why not go and see this film. But It was the biggest disappointment ever. I mean, mark's acting is so lifeless with no emotions at all. And then the crazy dialogues, Payne going from places to places with no solid reason. Mona comes out of nowhere. Then Alex dies. And then that drug thing. OH!!!! I wish I could beat the s*** out of the Director.How could they make a movie like this...huh? I guess they never played the game. It has pretty much nothing that goes with the game. I think they did this just to make some money. I'm a big fan of Max Payne. And now I'M in MAX PAIN MODE. Ahh!",Max Payne
216,p-steele,The Good & The Bad of Max Payne,5,14 November 2008,"I'm going to review this movie twice. The first will be as a fan of the game and the second will be as a fan of film.Review One  From a gamer's perspective. I'm a fan of both the Max Payne games. They had depth, story, action, bullet time and violence. That's everything that you would want from a game such as Max Payne. I was excited at the prospect of watching this movie. The events of the film a roughly based around the original Max Payne game. The director used some clever angles/shots to replicate the game in his movie and the flash back sequences were excellent. Having played the games there was no need for character development and the director did not develop characters that much so that was also a nice touch.I thought that the film took a while to get going. A few things did happen at the start to keep me interested in the film until the action kicked in. There was not much use of bullet time which was a bit of a let down as Max Payne was the first games to ever utilize effective slow motion in action sequences.The thing that really grinds my gears about this film is Mark Wahlberg. I just did not think he was convincing enough. I thought and thought as to whom would have been able to pull of this role and I believe that Hit-man star Timothy Olyphant would have pulled off this role. At least he looks a bit like Max Payne from the games, right? All in all, it was what I expected. It was slightly let down by Mark Wahlberg but it's not his fault he was miss-cast.I give this film a rating of 7 out of 10.Review Two  From a fan of film perspective. I am reviewing this as though I had not played the games or even heard of Max Payne before the film itself.I thought the directing in this movie did not make any sense whatsoever and just added to the confusion of the movie. None of the characters were developed and half the time I did not even know who the characters were and their purpose in the movie. Things were happening during the first hour of the movie without explanation and this just confused me. Quite a lot happened in the first part of the film but it still seemed to drag. This was not helped by the fact that the director did not explain the events in the film.Mark Wahlberg was very stale in this movie and showed no emotion at all. The rest of the characters could have been played by anyone and still had the same effect.This film was made for people that have played the game. The director could have easily developed characters and added depth to the story so that this film appeals to a wider audience. Sadly, if you have not played the games then you will just be left confused and cheated, as they should have called this film a sequel to the games.I would strongly advise you not to watch this film unless you have played the games.I give this film 3 out of 10.Closing Thoughts: My final rating for this film is 5 out 5. It's good if you're a fan of the game but a waste of time if you have not played the games. This is my opinion means the film was poorly executed and had so much more potential.",Max Payne
217,linkin_man_park,Watch it as movie not as movie based on game,8,20 October 2008,"I know why most of the people are hate this movie cause they wanted pure gun fight scenes or full action like Clive Owen Shoot em up .but if u see it as movie point of you its probably the best video game adaption movie .good story and very nicely directed the snow fall and other things are good .some acting was poor but in the end Mark walhberg is a great actor nicely did his acting .The whole Nordics angel stuff seemed kind of strange, but it works, and it proves visually stunning when displayed. I think people just weren't ready for a movie like this. Perhaps it's the whole 'based on a video game' thing they can't get over. This is over all 'highly recommended' to watch in theatersgo watch it rather than reading negative reviews good movie it is .",Max Payne
218,MozaredTFT,"Go back to your roots, Payne!",7,1 November 2008,"Alright, I saw this movie two hours ago. First impressions were ""Alright"", ""Too short"" and ""Too far from the games, not sure if that's a good or bad thing"". Now to think it over and expand that.Let me start off by saying I really really liked the games. The magnificent depressive feeling and one-liners Payne bombs his own story with create mind-blowing psychic explosions in both his and your own head. The blackish color and ""Downtown city"" feeling of the games were brilliant.But for some reason, none of this is included in the movie. The best it can be compared with is some kind Miami Vice-like TV series. The story wasn't horrible, but far from what you'd actually call good. Some characters (Like Mona Sax) seem to be too distant from the story to actually make a difference. And it's painfully obvious that Nicole Horne is only there because she was in the game and not because she had a crucial role to play.The special effects are nice, but aside from some of the demons they don't really add anything to the story. And why the heck was Chris Bridges playing Jim Bravura? Don't get me wrong, his acting was nice, but the Bravura from the game and Bridges are about as far apart as you can get.I've rated this movie a 7, but come to think of it, the only reason it's worth a 7 is because I'm a fan of the games. If you are, you ought to just watch the movie because it's fun to see names like Bravura, Sax, Ragnarock and Horne pop up. If you haven't played the games, skip this one. The story is too chaotic and the plot is too simple for the movie to be seriously entertaining.It's a shame really... If the movie had kept to the game more it could've been a big time blockbuster. Even directly implementing some of the one-liners of the game into the movie would've improved it a lot. The movie wasn't awful, but no matter how you put it; back to basics would've made it a lot better.",Max Payne
219,liampemberton,MAX PAINFUL,5,3 January 2019,"Based on the third-person shooter from 2001 about a detective getting revenge of his murdered family; Max Payne doesn't give what fans are looking for, it's not unique enough to give movie-goers what they are looking for, and the majority of it is boring as sin. Had this movie been allowed to go over the top crazy, this could have a very awesome, action-styled neo-noir stylish flick. As is, it's just dull with an occasional good shot here and there. But what does that matter when there's absolutely no substance and no fun to back it up?",Max Payne
220,vipher20,Beautiful rendition,8,22 October 2008,"There's three kind of people going to see this movie. 1--People that have no idea about the game that think they're just going to watch some kind shoot-em-up mixed with a Constantine/Sin-City feel. 2--Those that have played the game and enjoyed the gameplay. 3--Those that have played the game and enjoyed the gameplay, but moreso, were mesmerized by the entire feel of the storyline; the dark noir-like cut scenes, the way Max's loss hunts him continually in an eerie way, the twisted levels with S&M induced screaming in the background of one and others with the valkyrie laced druggies wondering around, and of course, the poetic story-telling by Max himself.Now, if you are one of the first two....let's face it, the majority of you just won't get it. You won't truly appreciate the lengths the director goes to in keeping the storyline congruent with the game, but not just rip it off completely. For those of you that keep saying Clive Owen should have played Max cause he did well in Shoot-em-up....you people should be the last ones to leave a rating on here. This film is not just a mindless shooter. This film would have been another game-to-film adaptation that had zero substance if Clive Owen had played the part. And people really would have been crying ""Sin-city ripoff"" if he'd played the part, since he was in that one too. Now was Mark Walberg PERFECT as the role? I don't know about that. But I thought he did a really job and captured Max's demeanor quite well.I know it seems there may be no difference between liking the game for it's gameplay and then loving the game for it's story-telling, but there really is. When me and my buddy discussed the game, we always talked about how good it was simply for the mood and storyline, rather than the actual gameplay. And we both ended up really liking the movie.You have to go into this movie understanding that there's more to it than just shooting guns and bullet time. If it was just those, the movie would have gaping plot-holes and would lose it's emotion. But the director leaves equal time for every issue; The eerie mood, how obsessed Max is with finding his wife's killer(s) and the way it affects his relationships, the hallucinations from the drugs, the corruption in which the valkyr has led to, and, yes, even the bullet-time. There really is a lot of substance to this film. It's a murder mystery film that also incorporates some vivid action and special effects. If people would know this going into it, I think their reaction would be a lot better. Probably not much of a movie to go watch with your g/f or wife, as my buddy's wife and her friend sat there and cut up the whole time cause they weren't connecting with the movie (which got on my nerves, as I was really into it).All in all, I think it was beautifully done. It set out to capture Max Payne from every angle and did just that. It took ample time to make fanatics of the game go ""holy crap, that scene was straight from the game"", but yet also write in some originality of it's own that worked well within the plot. As far as some of the characters, I thought every one of them played their part to near-perfection. Mila Kunis actually did surprisingly well and it was fun to see her play the femme fatale bad@$$. Ludicrous didn't really have that much riding on him, but he still played the part just fine and I never got the feeling of ""rapper-turned-cop"" from his performance (unlike the way I can't stand many of Ice Cube's performances cause he's very one-dimensional). Chris O' Donell had a very short role, but I thought he played it amazingly. I haven't seen him in anything in a while, but he played the part of a corporate big-wig scared for his life very well and showed a lot of emotion in his performance in a way in which you almost feel sorry for him. Beau Bridges executed his part perfectly (not much more to say about that). I even enjoyed Donal Logue's serious short role as Max's partner, Alex.Not a perfect movie, but definitely a good one, and by far the best video game-to-movie adaptation I've seen thus far.",Max Payne
221,michaeldjoyce,Booooo!!!!,3,3 January 2019,"I remember going to see this film with my family the day it opened. I was so pumped cause I grew up on the first game. Used to spend so many hours playing it and I beat it a thousand times. Great story with such a dark dramatic tone. Yet this movie had no balls to capture any of it. It's all over the place, has no soul, it doesn't make sense a lot and characters are totally useless. Mark Wahlberg gave it his all, but he feels at times like he doesn't wanna be there and you can't blame him. What was the point of having Mona Sax? In the first two games she was an important character but is totally wasted in this film and you can tell she also doesn't wanna be there. They obviously were just putting her in for the sake of being there all because she was in the game. Second question, what the hell was up with all the demon and Angel stuff when the game had nothing to do with any of that? It was all based around gunplay and bullet time. Yet this movie put so much focus on that which was stupid and why would you not place the murder of Max's wife and baby right at the beginning? Instead you place it in the second act and that just didn't work. Last but not least, Why in the world would you cast a rapper as a police captain? Come on!!! Overall, this was a bad movie. So many random things thrown at you and just don't about any of the characters. Whether you are a fan of the game or not, you will waste your time with this. I would not recommend this",Max Payne
222,Xorpion,Totally Fulfilling!,10,5 December 2008,"There could not have been a better tribute to the path breaking, trend setter in the video game world. I am simply stunned by the sheer amount of closeness the movie makers have made with the actual game.I am one of the many millions of people who got hooked up to shooter games after playing Max Payne. The main force that drove me to keep playing the game was its cinematic approach. The game had excellent cut scenes and wonderful narration with some great dialog. To watch all that as a movie starring one of my favorite  Mark Wahlberg was just amazing.You would not believe the level of attention to detail given to each and every aspect of the game. Be it the camera work, or the lighting or the sounds, even the way Max limps when he is down in health  Everything! Every Single Thing!I seriously don't know how this movie would mean to anybody who has not played the game, but for Fans of the game  this would be a real treat. I was waiting to watch each and every feature which made the game such a great hit and when they come up they just leave you in awe. It has everything used so cleverly - The Bullet Time mode, the puzzle sequences in between chapters, the weapons  and they used my favorite pump action shotgun the most! You should watch the scene where Max takes a dose of the Valkyr drug himself  simply superb.And for people who are wondering why the movie finishes with just the end of BB, wait till after the credits roll.The bottom line is  this is a terrific movie with great action, music and style. I would give it a straight 10 and would strongly recommendthis movie to anyone.",Max Payne
223,FinHalen,The Best Video Game Based Movie,9,20 October 2008,"Now I know thats not saying very much since the only other good one is Hit-man in my opinion. But video game movies aside this was one the best movies i've seen all year.One thing that makes it different than most vg movies is that it actually takes time to develop a coherent plot that stays faithful to the source material. There is little action for the first hour or so and the last 30 minutes are crammed with beautifully shot action scenes and Max's Signature Bullet time. there are only 4 bullet time scenes (i wish there was more seeing how often they happened in the game) but they are so beautifully shot that i didn't mind.Wahlburg plays Max Payne Very well, i can't think of anyone who could have played him better. Many people have been calling this movie a rip off of sin city, don't listen to them they are just proving their stupidity by comparing that piece noir garbage to this great movie.Whether you like thriller movies or are a Max Payne fan you should find this movie throughly enjoyable.",Max Payne
224,Chinchillajs,Don't Be Fooled By The Name!!,6,20 October 2008,"First off I am a large video gamer and I was pretty eager (and at the same time worried) to say the least when I heard Hollywood was making a movie adaptation to Max Payne because of how it could've gone in one of two directions; for example it could've been as horrifically tragic as the ""House of the Dead 1 & 2"" movies or respectable as the ""Resident Evil Franchise"" and yet John Moore (the director) gave us a third possible direction of how things could've turned out which is that it's a typical action movie (not a blockbuster as it's been hyped up to be and as far as it being a video game adaptation it fell real short ending up to be a big disappointment and hell it wasn't even that action packed compared to it's game counterparts). Simply put... all Beau Thorne (the script writer) do was borrow the name sake of some of the game characters from both Max Payne games as well as the concept of his family having been slain and then Beau Thorne (the script writer) made up a totally different Max Payne story and world thereby abandoning the continuity of the games and their story lines instead of staying true to them or their fans. Now onto the Pros & Cons of this movie... (Pros) the movie itself had at times a gritty look to it (slightly reminiscent of ""Sin City""). Special FX and visuals looked great but then again it's kinda hard to mess up on something like that nowadays. Finally casting did a pretty decent job on who they brought in though I wasn't completely sold on Mark Wahlberg's take on Max Payne; I myself would've liked to have seen Clive Owen's take on this role especially after seeing him in Michael Davis's ""Shoot 'Em Up"" which was a similar movie and where he played a similar character (actually now that I think of it I would've love to have seen Michael Davis both write and direct Max Payne and I think he would've stayed truer to it). (Cons) throughout the movie they kept focusing on the inner demons of taking drugs and what they may lead you to believe that you see (which was an interesting take on it) but my issues with it were... 1: I think they went a bit overboard with it and started to focus on those visuals too much, 2: for something they focused in on so much it had nothing to do with the Max Payne games (once again Hollywood going for visuals over substance). Now a huge problem that I did have with this movie which had they incorporated this game-play function properly (though they didn't) could've really turned this movie more so towards the juggernaut that it could've been was the feature ""Bullet Time"" made popular by the Max Payne game franchise (for those who aren't familiar with games or simply with these games ""Bullet Time"" is a feature in the games which allowed Max Payne to put the game-play in slow motion which allowed him to target or dodge better depending on the situation... very ""Matrix"" like). Here's how ""Bullet Time"" ended up being used... 1'st Time). Max Payne falling backwards while cocking a shotgun and shooting an assailant in the rap-tors above. 2'nd and Last Time). Max Payne shoots an unarmed. Are you serious?? I kid you not... such cool visuals which could've ended up in the movie (reminiscent of ""The Matrix Trilogy"") and instead it looked more like they simply threw it in last minute. To wrap things up... once again ""Max Payne"" was a typical action movie but not as much a ""Shoot 'Em Up"" (which I'd recommend certainly watching over ""Max Payne"" though at times some of the movie was a bit far fetched but then again it is a movie and the gun play/action more than makes up for it not to mention the on screen chemistry between Clive Owen and Monica Bellucci worked). As for ""Max Payne"" in my opinion you can hold off on and rent it when it becomes available. I hope all this came in handy. Enjoy!!",Max Payne
225,babagannuj,Watch it on 2x while doing something,4,7 August 2021,"I am a big fan of May Payne video games, 1, 2 and 3. All of them contains amazing storyline and superb characters. But this movie is unfortunately trash.It is really a great success to turn that kind of potential into a garbage. Movie contains countless mistakes that I don't have that much energy left to waste more time into it.One last note, I felt an influence from Constantine (2005) and 6 years later we had what we wanted with a different name as John Wick. Also with the Matrix example, maybe Keanu Reeves would have been a better choice for Max character.",Max Payne
226,alizekeriya,Generic at best!,4,14 February 2015,"I am a hardcore fan of the original game. It was a Neo-Noir Thriller meets John Woo type of game. However, when I went to see this film I lowered my expectations as many video game to movie adaptations are horrendous. What I saw was a generically action film, with none of the heart and meaning of the games. The casting choice itself was ""acceptable"" as Marky Mark kinda tried to act the role, given the script sucks, which was admirable. From changing important characters to cliché filled scenes, there is really not much to praise, except for a few visual scenes and some Slow motion action scenes. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even the main villain, a baffling choice to make it BB(Backstabbing Bastard) instead of Nicole Horne, who would've given the film an interesting and unsuspecting villain was demoted to a second tier character. Mila Kunis as Mona does not seem right, as her lines feel weak and forced, with almost no emotion behind it.(Same goes for other actors as well). All in all it is a very forgetful film, which is a shame, because they had so much potential to turn an amazing game into an equally amazing movie. For hardcore fans or regular fans of the games, stay away from it as you would feel that important characters or settings are completely disregarded. For casual moviegoers if you are into a bland generic action movie, with a few good scenes than this is highly recommended, otherwise stay away from it.",Max Payne
227,scootser-1,Uneven but entertaining,7,20 October 2008,"When I went into the cinema I wasn't expecting a grand story because I didn't care much for the game's plot either. What I expected were stylized gun scenes and eerie scenery. I was surprised when I realized they went in the other direction and created their own plot which sadly left out many memorable scenes such as the subway massacre and the playground. They also added three years between Max's vendetta taking place and his tragedy which made the character a lot less menacing. The first half an hour of Max Payne is admittedly a mess. The starting point is way off and the plot goes places as if no one knew what they were doing. After the mentioned half an hour however the plot becomes a lot more coherent and the action starts.Mark Wahlberg certainly looks the part of Max but he doesn't always act like him which is because he has never played the game. On multiple occasions his voice doesn't show the deep hurt he is supposed to have. One obvious miscast was Mila Kunis as Max's partner Mona mostly because her acting felt like watching a school play. All others do a decent job but then again they don't get a lot of screen time.Most of the scenery is copied straight from the game complete with floating snow and high rises. Sometimes it works and sometimes it feels a little forced. The scenes inside the Aesir company are beautiful to look at and exactly as I imagined they would look like. I for one loved the Valkyrie and fire and brimstone scenes even though there was nothing like them in the game. I have seen some complaints about how slow motion or bullet time was used in the movie but in my opinion it was implemented in the best possible way. Fighting scenes were well shot with red color flashing when Max got hit.The plot has some leaps of logic and the side plot with Lupino didn't seem to have much to do with the main story. However, I think it is much stronger as a movie than the game's story would have been. The ending is definitely very Max Payneish and anyone who wants to see the film because he has played the game won't be disappointed.",Max Payne

229,Stryder-56897,"""What are you a Cop or something?"", ""Not Tonight""",7,14 February 2021,"Keep in mind that I've never played any of the video games, not a gamer at all really. So my point of view is of a moviegoer and not a gamer.I've never been a fan of John Moore as a director, I mean he made the worst movie ever known as ""A Good Day to Die Hard"". That being said I did enjoy this movie, the second movie by John Moore that I liked after Behind Enemy Lines.The plot follows the titular character (Mark Wahlberg) investigating the death of his wife and child. He's a cop that's pretty much a one man army at first. Really enjoyed the scene in the underground subway. He then goes to his snitch's party and meets a woman (Olga Kurylenko) thinking that she might be a lead, he takes her to his place for questioning only to find that she wants to play. She leaves after he tells her to go, only moments later she gets murdered, what Max didn't know is that she stole his wallet making him a suspect in his own case.I thought Mark Wahlberg did a pretty darn good job as this character, I understand that apparently in the games the character is more gruff like Jon Bernthal but I like Mark as an actor and is once again unfamiliar with the source material. Mila Kunis plays the female lead in this movie and she's fine, Mila is one of those actresses that I feel works in the right role and while I would've picked someone else for this part if I was the director she still did ok.Beau Bridges and Ludacris were both pretty good in the movie as well, for some reason Nelly Furtado was in this, I like her music but I just thought she was just a bit random casting wise. The action scenes were pretty good, my favorite was the final one. My biggest issue with the movie is that the film leaves the whole thing with the Valkyries too vague. Are they real or an illusion?, I still have no clue because if they are an illusion then the scars that the villains' victims get don't line up with what they would be capable of doing.One more thing that I liked that I'll highlight is the style. I liked this film noir style, it reminds me of Watchmen or Sin City, it's a style and type of storytelling that resonates with me for some reason. Overall I enjoyed this movie, far better than A Good Day to Die Hard, Flight of the Phoenix, The Omen Remake and I.T., about the same as Behind Enemy Lines for me and also this is one of the better video game film adaptations out there.",Max Payne
230,igor-muller,it was OK but something was missing,6,12 November 2008,"something rather vital. i wasn't sure what through it, and even after i finished. i am a computer gamer, absolutely enthusiastic about it, was pretty much into e-sport in early 2000s here in Russia. so i am kinda in that stuff. but - funny - i never liked Max Payne series, may be because i don't like rather ""mindless"" FPS games (tho i love tactical ones like competitive CS or Quake). while i admire the atmosphere it once created, still i wasn't a fan of it. so i was watching the movie with absolutely zero expectations, still in touch with idea behind it.it was good, but it wasn't enough. i think this movie COULD be better, i mean really, i loved the idea, i loved all that winged stuff (not to spoil :D ), atmosphere, some scenes were in fact good, but something went wrong. a lot of scenes were very badly shot, some editing was extreeeeemly annoying, the movie lacked suspension terribly, it was just not enough space.yeah i think that is - it was too crumpled. there should be just some more fresh air into it, for contrast. some better dialogs, some better editing and directing, and it might come out as a really good film. but as it is now - just overage flick, i liked Babylon A.D. better but hey, i am Yeoh's fan!",Max Payne
231,rubenmeibergen,Epic failure,3,24 January 2009,"I've played the games a couple of years ago. What do the players get served while playing the game? 90% action, 10% storyline. The story is obviously the red line through the whole game, but the game is about the shooting, about the bullet time action. The atmosphere that has been lay'd down underneath the game is grim, its underworld, its depressive. The character is angry, he doesn't value his life anymore. He's out for revenge.If you make a movie from such a game, the first thing you do is take those basic, simple ingredients and make that the core of the movie. Which is exactly what the director and especially the writer didn't grasp. I mean, if you want to make a movie about ""Need for Speed"", you're not going to see speeding cars for 5% of the movie right? You will have to see that basic ingredient at least 70-80%.I'll explain how I would do the movie. First of all, you cast a character that looks like Max Payne. Mark Walberg, does not look like Max Payne. Clive Owen looks like Max Payne. But most likely he didn't even want to play the character because he looked at the script for 5 seconds and decided its terrible. If someone like Clive Owen doesn't want to do it, you take someone that might not be that known, but at least looks like Max Payne.That set aside, we've seen what, 1 or 2 bullet time action scenes? That's the same as creating a movie about a race game and doesn't show races. Its amazing how they did not grasp this.The whole story and the other introduced characters in the movie are completely irrelevant. I'll sum up what you need to put in the movie if you want to please the fans. Its fairly simple.You start off with Max Payne in a subway station, blowing opponents to pieces with subtle, but mind-blowing bullet time action scenes. After 15 minutes of pure action, you show some of the dreams Max Payne had in the game, so the watcher gets introduced why he's doing what he's doing. The rest is completely irrelevant. The bullet time actions scenes has to be in there at least 12-15 times, since that was the key element that made Max Payne a successful shooter. Further on you get introduced with the top level criminals, what they are doing, who they are, why they are doing what they are doing. In the game there's also a big fire scene in a restaurant, which was clearly an important aspect in the story line of the game. Why wasn't this scene in the movie? Did Mr. Moore even know the game? He must have not played it, that is so clear. The incompetence in Hollywood amazes me.I demand a remake of Max Payne by Robert Rodriguez.",Max Payne
232,alexk-ronning,"Not faithful to the game, and is just a disappointing movie regardless.",5,25 May 2011,"I was so looking forward to this movie, the Max Payne games are some of my favorite video games ever. They had a dark, awesome, melodramatic script, along with over the top but brilliant voice acting. It had a gripping crime noir story, where all the characters mattered, and you really cared what happened to them. It even had some black humor. The thing that stood out most in the game though, was the John Woo style bullet time action. The movie is faithful to the game in pretty much none of these ways.First of all, pretty much every character is miscast. Mark Wahlberg is a great actor, but for Max Payne, no way. His mannerisms, his voice, just can't pull it off. And to top it off, he just doesn't have any of the style or humor that Max Payne should have. Mila Kunis is also terribly out of place. If anyone knows the character of Mona Sax, you'll be thinking throughout the movie, what were they thinking? She just feels far to young and... I don't know, she just doesn't have the presence that Mona Sax should have. That's just the two main characters. Get ready to see Ludicrus play Police Chief Jim Bravura, who was an old fat guy in the game! What the poo??? Then you have I can't remember his name playing BB, that just didn't fit. BB was a smooth talking, double crossing pretty boy. Now he's an old dude who is a mentor/friend to Max.Even the way the movie ended wasn't true to the game! The person who was behind it all is totally different to who it was in the game, that just boggled my mind, what the poo... The only thing that really stayed faithful to the game was the look of the film. Dark, snowy, and a very bleak, but awesome visual style. Everything looks the part, but it just isn't. I'll get down to the action now, which is one of the biggest disappointments here. The action itself is impressive, well choreographed, and stays true to what the game offered. To some extent. The last few scenes of the movie are truly awesome. But if only the whole movie was this way. There is actually very little action here. There is literally NO ACTION until we hit somewhere past the halfway mark. So that means, if you're just looking for a decent action movie, with no interest in the game whatsoever, Max Payne will fail you.And then I'm just going to say, the story didn't follow the game at all, and it makes you wonder if the movie makers or the actors even played it, I'm pretty sure they didn't. I would personally have chosen to show the death of Max Payne's family at the beginning of the movie, just as the game did. Otherwise, to people who don't know the original storyline, Max's goals are mostly unclear. This review is a late, so everyone knows that the Max Payne movie is a disappointment, for fans of the game, and for people who just want a good revenge/action movie. I feel like I could remake this movie, and it would be 10 times better.",Max Payne
233,campkllyrsf-1,"Looks great, but that's all that's great.",4,21 October 2008,"I was excited for this movie, but with Fox behind the release, you know something is going to be screwed up.I tried to watch this movie and separate it from the game, but I was unable to do so. It's alright if they keep the tone of the game, and keep the general plot of the game in the movie. First thing messed up, the rating. How can you take a Mature rated game, with a subject matter such as revenge, and bring it down to a PG-13? If you've played the Max Payne game, I bet you were also worried about the PG-13. Acting, no one was great. Mark Wahlberg, as much as I like him, did not serve justice for Max. Mila Kunis did pretty well for Mona Sax, but Mona wasn't in the game very much at all, so not really a lot to compare the two. Bridges and Ludicrous were decent, but nothing special. I will say Ludicrous is getting pretty good and is one of the better rapper-turned-actors. Story, if they would have kept the story from the game as close as they could, it would have been a great one to tell. But here, they take the basics from the game: Max loses his wife and child and is seeking revenge; They're linked to this drug Valkyr... that's pretty much it. Everything else is changed and brought down to clichéd crime stories. It was neither deep nor gripping. About half way through I just wanted to see stuff blow up or people get killed.Speaking of which, there wasn't a lot of either. Through half the movie, nothing really happens. By the time something does happen, I was going ""finally, some action."" But, the action wasn't really what I hoped for. The game had such great action scenes, they could have taken any scene from the gameplay and easily made it into a movie. But, some of the best parts of the action in the game, they leave out. They did the bullet time a few times, but it seemed like they put them in the wrong places. And one bullet time was slowed down so much it seemed like it was kind of making fun of bullet time. Unnecessary and ridiculous. There were things I did enjoy in the movie. First off, cinematography. It was very dark and gritty. It had a visual tone similar to the game, different, but pretty effective. The special effects were done pretty well, and the Valkyries looked cool. I think the valkyries were taken from the graphic novels, which I haven't read, but that's what I've heard. Back on topic, I really liked how the movie looked. Some of the shots were really nice, and the overall look of the movie was impressive. Along with that, while the action sequences weren't great, some of the shots were pretty brutal. When these guys were shot by shotguns, they flew back. It was one of the few things about the gun fights that I thought was well done.The style of the movie was cool, but only appearance wise. The action was flat, nothing new. The story was nothing of what it could have been. And the acting was average to sub-par. I didn't think the movie was terrible, but definitely not worth the title of Max Payne. Fox adds another movie to it's list of movies they've screwed over. 2/5 rental at best.",Max Payne
234,tclegg-60959,A Missed Opportunity,5,2 March 2021,"This film is a really big missed opportunity. The styling and story line of the game could have been easily transferred t oa dark and violent film noir with a nice dose of conspiracy thrown in. Unfortunately all of this is wasted on a very tame and lackluster film that stick to a predictable formula with poor character development and sloppy dialogue.Some of the visuals are nice but the lack of any true bullet time (which is a big mechanic of the games) is a real let down. As for the violence, yes there is a lot of shooting but this is a film that needed to be darker and more visceral. Had the action been more similar to films such as John Wick and the Raid or even the Punisher (TV series not film) and this film could of had potential. Unfortunately all of this was repeatedly squandered through.The acting is fine but I felt that the poor script left them very little to work with. Hopefully in time this will get some form of reboot and correct these wrongs.",Max Payne
235,jjwile,Not bad for a movie based on a game,7,18 October 2008,This movie was pretty good for a movie based on a game. It actually stayed with the story with the game. It was cold dark stork like the game itself. same exact characters from the game even jack lapinio was still psychotic like in the game and upsets with demons and hell. As for the birds of prey thing its just extra special effects to give the computer animators something o do so you don't really expect a john Constantine movie. It's not like doom or when the super Mario brothers movie came out and tey were both stupid. I believe this movie lived up to the hype and it will make enough money too pay for itself in no time. I recommend it for a good movie maybe a few awards for special effects and for action.,Max Payne

237,raymondknapik,Very Disappointed With The Movie,4,1 November 2008,"When I first saw the trailer for Max Payne I thought it looked pretty cool. But I have to say after seeing the movie I very disappointed with the movie. The trailer is misleading also. For I thought the movie was going to be somewhat like Constantine and it was no were near that at all nor as good. The movie is based off the video game of the same name and the video game is better then the movie was. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg , Beau Bridges, Mila Kunis, Chris O' Donnell, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, and Donal Logue. Mark Wahlberg does a good job as Max Payne. But he can't even save the movie. There was some cool action scenes but that all there was. The story was very weak. So skip this movie all together. It is not worth seeing. The movie is about Max Payne trying to track down the ones who killed his wife and child.",Max Payne
238,johnnie02,"Average, yet worth seeing",6,24 October 2008,"First I am a very big fan of MAX PAYNE game, especially because of the story; all the comics & flashbacks, & as all other games I've played, I really hoped I could someday see MAX PAYNE as a movie, & it did happen. But, I was a little disappointed by the movie, it did had some parts of the game but not as I imagined, the story line was too weak, too few flash backs, & almost no action for a very long time. On the other side, the movie theme was exactly as the game theme; always dark, black & white surroundings, & snowing, maybe that's the only good thing about the movie, along with some suspense every now & then. The acting was OK, except that some characters were not good at all, & Mark Wahlberg was not as ""emotional"" as ""Max"" in the game, but he was good. I recommend you go & see this movie, it's not that bad as people say, although not that good, but worth to see even once. I enjoyed it but not so much!",Max Payne
239,Rybergare,Best game-movie adaption out there,7,19 October 2008,"Many people will think this is a boring, not very new thinking movie but you have to play the games to get it. People who haven't played the games wont get some parts and will just think they are weird or stupid. So you, who haven't played the games, don't give this movie crap because you just don't get it. I think this is a great game to movie adaption, far better than Tomb Raider or Hit-man. The movie really captures the feeling and atmosphere of the games, the darkness, snow, rain and so on. That is what this movie really needed to succeed as a good Max Payne adaption, and it has that. The acting was good too, Wahlberg is really good as Max Payne and many of the other characters fits in their parts and looks like they do in the game, which is good. And i was really kind of surprised that the story followed the first game almost exact, which made me feel good. Because i don't think you should change the script much when its based on something. The visuals are great, really well made effects. Also really cool and well shot photo and filming, with good light and so on. But i think there's just one thing i want to say is bad, it was not as much action as i thought, to be a real Max Payne movie this should have had more action in it. Well the action scenes are cool and exciting but if you expect as much action as in the game, you wont get it. But i also think that just that is what maybe keeps the movie good too, because if the producers had stuffed the movie with tons of action it maybe just would have seemed more ""b"" like lets say ""Doom"". It wouldn't be taken so serious as it should be. Because the game is a really serious one, which has a good story and a deep meaning and to explain all that, lots of action wouldn't fit in. So my final opinion is that this is a really good movie-game adaption, the best out there. Good characters, cool environments and effects and of course its Max Payne, one of my favorite games. So if you like the game, go see this. But if you haven't played the games, don't expect much, it will probably be an OK movie anyway but its best with the game experience in you luggage.",Max Payne
240,emirdumani,Mark Wahlberg is Max Payne,7,17 October 2008,"I don't whose idea was to change the story of the games but i can understand. They wanted a short story that non-Max Payne fans could relate to...but butchering an incredible story mixing up characters is bad for business if you are planning a sequel.As a fan off action movies i liked this movie, it had everything in order, a good story good characters and good acting(except the female lead Mila Kunis). As a die-hard Max Payne fan i'm outraged. I played and finished the games maybe a dozen times, and i finished'em again a month ago so i would remember the story accurately before watching the movie version.As a Max Payne fan i know the characters have been slaughtered...Mona Sax was the coolest chick in any game up to this date giving her such lines and making MEG GRIFFIN deliver them was a grave mistake, getting a minor character like BB Hensley and making him important was another mistake. Beau Bridges is an excellent actor but there is no place for him in this story...not in original charactered version. I have many other comments about other characters namely Jim Bravura and Alex but since the story was changed dramatically i don't know how else they could be casted...As for the lack of Vinnie Goggnitti ,Alfred Woden and Vladimir Lem's presence i have nothing to say...but if you ask any Max Payne fan they would probably name Vlad to be one of the best characters in games.Finally i would like to add that i cannot imagine a better actor for the job of Max Payne than Mark Wahlberg, he was really good.I would like to wrap-up my ideas now, since it looks like gibberish know that i read it, but it reflects everything i wanted to say about this movie. If you are looking for a good action movie, don't miss it...but if you are a Max Payne fan who played the games as if they were movies you are going to be disappointed.",Max Payne
241,Vercettiter,"I must be one of those rare ""one percent"" that actually like this movie.",10,14 November 2013,"First off, to those who don't understand the title, ""one percent"" is a reference to something related to the movies plot. Anyway, most the reviews I see are talking bad about this movie. Not me! I loved it, and will try to explain why. This movie is basically art. The cinematography, the action, and dare I say story as well. Why did I not mention the characters? Well, you could figure that out for yourself, but I will get to that. Some of the story may be hard to understand the first time through, so you will have to at least somewhat like this movie to get everything. It will require multiple viewings! If you think it doesn't make any sense, you have probably missed something. If you think the plot is simple, you simply didn't catch everything besides the obvious. The characters all certainly make sense, and Max himself I really liked. The thing is though, most people probably aren't going to care for him. He is rather one-dimensional, in the sense that there really isn't a whole lot to him. The reason I like him anyway, is because he is exactly the kind of guy I would want to be. Cold, obsessed, and depressed? No. Cool, calm, and a total bad-ass! I also really felt for him, and wanted the bad guys to pay. The character BB, I also liked. He has that personality and that energy to him, but there isn't anything special about him besides that. The other characters aren't great, they just work. Their only purpose really is to move the story further. So, overall none of the characters are really very much of a conversation piece. Now, about that cinematography. This film looks absolutely amazing! Eye-candy. The water, the snow, the gun shots, and the very pores on Max's face, are all made for blu-ray! The action in this movie was definitely very exciting also! The action was like, ""Awesome!"" And, in some moments I could feel my heart beating just as you could here his. Like I said, I must be rare for liking this movie. I expect some sarcastic thoughts too. Like, ""yeah, because you've got bad taste"". I really don't care though. I love this movie, and I have tried to explain why. 10/10!",Max Payne

So every body expected the oncoming script of the movie. I personally thought that there would be a lot of action scenes full of slow motion effects, guns and enemies. But i fell in a despair when i watched the film. I waited from the beginning to the end that the action would begin, but it didn't. then I started to think that the film making industry is about to fall. Because it is harder to make worse when the title is ""max payne"". Butthe atmosphere and color of the scenes fit the script's nature. But somebody must spend more money to add more action scenes to the movie.",Max Payne
243,andrew-413,One of the worst movie of '08,1,13 January 2009,"That a load of trite. I've played the games but frankly this shouldn't have to come into it in my opinion. Let the movie stand on it's own merits, of which is has few. Note I did not state none: the cinematography in places (location shots, urban scenes) were well done as with some of the film footage's treatment (somewhat black and white and nice depth of field exaggeration). Everything else in the film fails. The characters have no depth whatsoever. No storyline was really developed other than Max on a perpetual, monotonous mind-less hunt for his wife's killer(s). The main villain had a couple of sentences throughout the film, so I really didn't care for him. His howling like a mad dog at the moon made me laugh. Was I meant to feel he was a threat to Max Payne? Hell, Max should have dispatched him with a dictionary... that'd kept him busy. Often the scene's came across so sterile you actually saw through the pretty 35mm film treatment and saw props, a set and actors. The Angels of Death or Valkyries didn't help matters: they had no relationship to Max during his visualizations of them. So it was just plain useless eye-candy. Shame on the director and producers for this utter piece of rubbish. Mark Wahlberg should watch his next move carefully after the flop that was 'The Happening' and then this. Oh yes, and if you liked 'Transporter 3', disregard all of my criticisms: you'll love this film! 'Max Payne' in my mind truly deserves one star. First review I've given with such a dismal score!",Max Payne
244,tanyels,This movie is GOOD,8,26 October 2008,"Before I watched the movie, I had no idea about it. I hadn't watch the trailer and I didn't even knew the movie was out. I just enjoyed playing Max Payne so I decided to go see it.And then, I saw, one of the best game adaptation I've ever seen. The movie doesn't actually just use the storyline, it also uses the theme of the game so well that it felt like watching the ingame scenes. The theme is so well presented that just by looking at the colors of a frame, I could tell that this was related to Max Payne.The presentation of the city, with all the scattered doors, the snow, the messy people who waste their lives was incredible. The movie is so depressive but it's also really fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is being accused for being dull but I disagree. I think that his emptiness, his inconsequential and inconspicuous way of acting made me believe that this character had lost all his hope in life and he was only motivated by revenge. In short, he was good. And even the ""hot girl"" factor that has to be included in every movie for financial reasons was so well incorporated in the Max Payne theme that you would ask yourself if it was also a part of the storyline in the game.So if you liked the game, just go see this. This movie is immense and it sucks you in. It was one hell of a movie.",Max Payne
245,thewarriorsfan666,A huge missed opportunity.,4,30 October 2008,"Months ago I said that I had hope that Max Payne would be able to shed its video game trappings and become a good movie. Boy were those hopes killed in the worst way. Way too murky and over-plotted, Max Payne is a misfired jumble of plot threads that begin and then are promptly discarded with no reason whatsoever. Its as if the filmmakers had no idea what they were going for and just jumped at one idea to another with little to no thought.However, its not just Beau Thorne's terrible script that deserves a beating. John Moore is director who is facing a major slump after getting a good start with Behind Enemy Lines. Safe to say, its not getting any better for him. Not only can Moore not develop any sort of coherency, but the guy just can't direct actors properly.Mark Wahlberg had that same problem in The Happening, but hes even worse here, as his character is so clichéd and boring that the audience doesn't ever care what he's going through. There were even a couple of people next to me that said that they hated him in the worst way. Surprisingly though, hes not the worst here. Mila Kunis, who endeared us to her with her engaging performance earlier this year in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, lacks any flair or personality in a thankless role that was terribly miscast from the get-go.Some actors do better than others, but barely. Beau Bridges' mentor whatever to Payne (what freaking purpose does he actually serve in this anyway?) goes nowhere and doesn't really add anything to the overall package. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges internal affairs character is initially interesting, and Bridges actually does well, but is derailed by a script that gives him nothing to do. Nelly Furtado's debut is really good, so she's understandably abandoned by the script, apparently because she kept upstaging Wahlberg at every turn.The only saving grace is its production values, which is definitely beautiful to look at. The gun battles are way too few and way too far between, but when the action gets going, things get flat-out ridiculous and ludicrously fun. Its clear a lot work went into the production and its gorgeous at times. It's just too bad its in service of such a terrible film.",Max Payne
246,scott-tomasso,Wow....,1,26 October 2008,"Let me first just say that I AM a fan of the video game. So I, like others who have commented on here already, was really just looking for a fun action movie. I didn't expect it to be Oscar worthy or anything like that...just a fun time at the movie theater.That being said...I was extremely disappointed at this movie. Actually, that's being nice about it. This was such a poorly executed story that I nearly walked out. Seriously, seriously bad.The visuals were nice, but even THOSE were too stylized and even painfully funny to watch at times (most of the time). It seemed they were trying too hard. And for an action film, there sure was a lack of action for the first 3/4 of the movie.Now the acting...I honestly felt I was watching a student film with some of those scenes. Ludicrous was just that. Mark Wahlberg was OK at best. Donal Logue - awful, Mila Kunis - out of place...the only bright spots were Chris O'Donnell and Olga Kurylenko (who is smoking hot).Bottom line...I would not recommend this movie to anybody.

Something was totally missing from this movie, but I can't put my finger on what? There was only one main character, as opposed to the two or three we were led to believe from the trailer. The Marine guy seemed like a real player in the script, but ends up being tossed away like yesterday's garbage.

Maybe... this movie comes close to by a forth toward its source material. Hate to rain on your parade but the drug, Valkyr in the original video game was never about literal demons snatching people. Seriously, where was the heart into making this film? Nowhere to be found.I don't even know where to begin without going into spoilers, but the Max Payne character was about a on-the-run undercover cop who was framed for the murder of his partner, Alex after the death of his wife and newborn daughter a few years prior.

Number one warning : it is categorized as an ""Action, Crime, Drama"" and rated PG-13. - only the rating is appropriate.

(There was hope in the opening but then nothing) Action scenes = minimal. (Not too bad other than being sparse) Acting = very good for what little the script offers. (The actors do not deserve the blame for this atrocity unless it is for choosing to do this script.) Scenery/Cinematography = Brilliant but wasted on scenes like 8 minutes picking up a folder with no conflict in the scene. (The scenery was impressively accurate to the game. I kept feeling like it was going to get better because of it. Then nothing would happen.)I wanted this to be good. I kept lying to myself and saying it would get better any minute.People who say I am disappointed because it isn't the video game need to understand I didn't want the video game I wanted an action film that captured the essence of the game.We are left with no reason to care for Max Payne. If I was the writer I would have been ashamed to have my name attached.Max Payne got the Indy treatment.I really want my money back on this one. I felt insulted that they thought this script was a passable story.,Max Payne

Don't take me wrong, but Ludicrous associates with gangs/rap not a noir style detective. And the choice to take My Name is Earl actor Beau Bridges was just plain wrong. Really, he is good at comic roles, but for such a film... he just does not fit in.I was unable to get away the feeling that something was wrong with this movie all the time watching it.

At first I was confused about the angels and demons thing and how it would be related to the game. They actually make it all work very well. Its roughly related to the game as in it keeps the of the basic idea but certain scenes and characters from the game are not present :( (Sadly Vlad is not in the movie. They had great special effects and the mood of the movie really matched the grittiness of game. The only this that disappointed me was there wasn't enough major gun fights and any some of the bullet time sequences from the game. But don't get me wrong the movie did have bullet time in it. Just not to the extent I wanted. The shots they did have of it thought were amazing! They leave room for a second movie which I hope they do. One thing completely missing from the movie were pain killers! The signature mark in the game... oh well thou. Its not a big thing... its kinda like saying the Doom movie didn't have the health dispensers :P.

Max Payne was perhaps one of the most groundbreaking, entertaining games in history when it was released. I must have played it through three times in the first two weeks. The only thing this movie had in common with the game were its title and some names.The story still had the same basic premise as the game, yes. But all of the little things that were changed ruined this movie for me, and I think a lot of them stemmed from trying for the PG-13 rating. Max Payne was a dark, brooding, VIOLENT game. I wouldn't let a 13-year-old play it, and I wouldn't want a 13-year-old seeing a movie based on it, IF THE MOVIE WERE FAITHFUL. This piece of trash was so predictable and non-entertaining, I found myself looking at my watch halfway through, wondering when the credits were going to roll so I could leave.I don't want to get into more specific points, because I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't played the game and are just looking to watch Mark Wahlberg for an hour and a half.

Yet whoever had the pleasure of playing the games would realise that it fall well short of the lofty standard both games has set.I think the best definition of the movie is a mix of detective drama, sin city's noir graphic, a tiny sprinkle of shoot-em-up action at the end.It tries to be everything, and ended up to be totally confusing.I think the movie would have gone a lot better if they go to the extreme in one direction (preferably action wise) instead of trying to make acceptable plot (which fall shorts of the standard required of any detective or conspiracy movies anyway).Max Payne was a shooting game - yet by no mean it was Doom (heck, at least this movie is better than the screen adaptation of Doom); it was a captivating, story driven shooting game.It is funny that Hit-man did it wrong by doing too much slick actions where the game was stealth based and Max Payne was getting it wrong by doing too much detective drama when the game is about action.Perhaps some of these directors should spend a few weeks playing the games from start to finish so at least they understand what they are trying to bring to the wide screen.",Max Payne
258,drjmetz,Why more than a passing nod to the original source matters,2,13 August 2010,"I managed to catch this (finally!) and delayed putting it off until I finished playing Max Payne again (coincidentally I was already in the middle of playing the game when the TiVo caught the film off HBO). As a result, I was fresh off playing the game before watching the movie.I look at it this way. If I changed the names of the characters to something else, would I:1) recognize this as Max Payne, and/or 2) think the film was enjoyable?The answer to 1 seemed pretty clear to me. I wouldn't have seen it as MP, but would have thought that the writer had obviously been inspired by some of the elements of the game. The answer to 2 was, well, it was a very pretty movie but there was a great deal of disconnect from scene to scene, and with a set of characters in which none are developed from beginning to end, there wasn't much to really admire except for the nifty cinematography. Otherwise, the plot was very, very cliché and predictable.The reasons why movies are made from video games are varied, but effectively there's something inherent in the game that makes for a compelling big-screen adventure. If you take Resident Evil as an example0, it was nifty traps and some intense action (zombies!!). For Max Payne, the compelling intrigue was the character as well as the mystery behind 1) his family's murder and 2) who set him up. In the game, he wasn't sure who to trust - including himself - as his predicament made very strange bedfellows. Sadly, his family's murder was the only thing that was included in the film and that was pretty evident early on. There was none of the mistrust of Mona, the uneasy alliance with Vlad, the personal vendetta with Punchinello. Game-Max was forced to take Valkyr and his experience was horrific because he was trapped in a nightmare of his family's death, searching for them to save them and yet taunted by their incessant crying for help. Movie-Max took the drug of his own accord to gain the strength that Game-Max found through emotional loss. This is a very different character.Slapping a couple of logos onto the walls as graffiti and using the same names does not mean that the movie adheres to the story. Game-Max and Movie-Max are not the same character, nor were the motivations, nor were the way in which the story was told. There's really not much left to tie it to the original.Even with the game the plot was predictable. Evil corporation pushing bad drugs on the street; nothing new there. But through Game-Max's jaded eyes and so-corny-that-even-he-knew-it commentary, the noir became a compelling reason to run from the cops and the Mafia to search for answers.By throwing demons into the mix as the movie does, and as often as it does, it's similar to saying that you're going to make a Harry Potter movie but replace wands with light sabers and include a few alien spaceships; oh, and Harry is actually a 25-year-old orphan whose parents were killed attempting to overthrow the Ministry of Magic. Those pesky Death Eaters? Yeah, we just left them out. It might work and it might be close enough to the original, it even might be a decent movie if done properly, but it's disingenuous to call it Harry Potter.As a Max Payne flick, I rated it a 1. As a non-Max Payne flick, because of the beautiful cinematography but crappy character development and uber-predictable plot line, it got a 3.",Max Payne
259,hrafnthor,A disappointment,3,17 October 2008,"First of let me say that I played Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The fall of Max Payne. I just came from the cinema and man am I disappointed. First of Mark Wahlberg is too nice to play Max. If I'm not mistaken he say's please a few times in the movie! Thats not Max. He fires about 6 shots during the whole first hour of the movie (not kidding). Thats not Max.He eats not a single painkiller during the whole movie. Thats definitely not Max.There are about maybe 15 people that get shot during the whole movie. Thats not Max.There is no blood, no big action scenes except at the end where the film tries to recreate the large finale from the first game where Max storms the Aesir tower and slaughters everything that moves. But it fails miserably. Mona Sax is played badly by Mila Kunis. And fortunately for the audience she only gets a few scenes.There are good bits though. The look of the scenes are good. That cold, dark and wet world that the game takes place in is really captured in the film. Though places like Ragnarok and the harbor could have used more love. I give this film 3 stars for the good looks but the acting is bad, the action is bad and the body count is non-existent.",Max Payne
260,Koettbullen,Skip the bad reviews and go see it,5,5 June 2009,"All the bad reviews comes from angry gamers, who complain about everything.I had Max Payne 1 on the Ps2 and i kinda liked it, didn't play it so often but it was an OK game. But i'm not here to review the game, i'm just going to write something short about the movie.It have some great visuals, very good action scenes and it feels like those ""old b detective movies"" kinda like Sin City. The only problem is that it gets kinda boring and it has one of the worst dialogs ever, even though there's some great ones as well. Also the plot is kinda mixed and i didn't like the drug part.When i went to the cinema i had an open mind and for that, i enjoyed this movie.If you haven't played the game: 5/10. If you have played the game: 2/10.Thanks for reading through :P",Max Payne
261,christianvillagomez,There'll still always be a sense of regret though...,6,4 July 2010,"Honestly in a world where adapting video-games to movies is as hopeless as the words' definition itself you'd have expect this BAFTA award winning film-noir oriented game ""Max Payne"", which was basically already a playable movie, to be easy to translate to the big screen. But no: instead of 20th Century Fox just bothering to ask the original games' creator/screenwriter Sam Lake if he could take the time to convert his original masterpiece into a version easily fitted for give or take 2 hours, they go to Beau Thorne: a man who seriously needs work on a story's coherence and hardly could've played the whole game himself. Just like basically everybody else, the movie will always stay inferior to the game no matter how much more I learn to appreciate this for its own story. To me there's only 3 things the film did that was faithful to the game: 1.) I cannot begin to tell you how perfect Mark Wahlberg was as Max Payne! 2.) Director John Moore perfectly recaptured the look and feel of snow-trenched nighttime NYC 3.) The (very few) action scenes do kinda feel like levels out of the game. Other than that, the only original idea they included in here that I enjoyed were sunnyside moments of May Payne still in his dark clothes visiting his wife & daughter in an almost heavenlike version of their house. The story's just so different and though this movie could've been so much shittier given it's still game-to-movie material but there'll always be a sense of regret given this movie could have been done SO much better and SO much easier.",Max Payne
262,Optimus_,Don't buy the critics from the hardcore game fans,8,19 October 2008,"You'll see a lot of critics from people who think that not following exactly the game's plot/scenario/character buildup/whatever is wrong. Quite the opposite, this is exactly what makes Max Payne a good, standalone movie. It's the best Hollywood attempt to make a film noir in the last 5-6 years. The plot has logic and, what is very important (at least to me) the violence serves the plot, not vice-versa.Actors perform very well, the script has tension and, overall, we're talking about a movie that doesn't have obvious flaws at any level. 8/10, definitely worth seeing.A 9/10 for Max Wahlberg, probably the best pick possible today for the role.",Max Payne
263,underclass_hero24,So much potential wasted on what could have been a great film,3,6 April 2011,"I was amazed with the opening scene and Max's grim monologue ""I don't believe in Heaven. I believe in Pain. I believe in Fear. I believe in Death. There's an army of bodies under this river, people who ran out of time, out of friends. I could feel the dead down there, reaching up to welcome me as one of their own. It was an easy mistake to make."" set the Max Payne tone perfectly. From there on the film just disappointed. Mark Waldberg could have made a decent Max, but he over did his lines and didn't sound at all like Max's low key. And also I don't get the comparisons, Mark looks nothing like Max, except when Max squints. The story had potential, it was set up right, Max seeking revenge for the death of his wife and Michelle. But then they decided it was his only objective and not tracking down the source of the Valkyr drug like in the game. It made Max look like a bit of crier. Mona Sax played by Mila Kunis? This is when I realized this film was no good. Actually no that's a lie. I realized how terrible it was when the script writers revealed that they either hadn't played the game or just wanted to f**k the story up by throwing in Nordic monster. Yes okay, sure it was a Valkyrie, yes the drug is named after it, yes the game does reference Norse mythology but never at ANY point in the game did Max fight a Valkyrie! This film had a lot of potential, even with the lack of action, if the script writers had simply just copied the games narrative (which essentially was an interactive film noir), it could have been a lot more fun to watch. But no, apparently there is an inability in Hollywood to make a good film based on game.",Max Payne
264,tlseigl,Would be a perfect MST3K selection,1,18 October 2008,"I went to see ""Max Payne"" more to socialize with some friends who were going, not out of any vested interest in the film. I'll be up front: I had no idea what to expect from this movie, having never played the game that it was based on. If they made ""Tetris: The Movie"" or ""Super Mario Kart"" into feature films, I'd have more of a leg to stand on. But let's just go ahead and say what I need to say: this movie was awful.For starters, I've like Mark Wahlberg in some movies, but in this one he's all about maintaining a fierce stare no matter what's going on around him. He's channeling Clint Eastwood, which would be perfect if not for the fact that he comes off more like a constipated cop than one hell-bent on revenge. The screenwriters don't do him any favors by making him the single stupidest policeman to wear a NYC badge. He's like an intense Inspector Clouseau, always two or three steps behind the audience in figuring out just what is going on (trust me, you'll figure out the villains of the piece long before he does, and that is no spoiler).Surrounding him is an equally intense cast, most notably Beau Bridges as his father figure and mentor. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges is decent with what little of his character there is, an IAD officer who suspects Payne of vigilante justice. Mila Kunis actually comes off as believable when she steps into the role of a revenge-fulled Russian mobster (yes, Jackie from ""That Seventies Show"" can pack a mean Uzzi). Compared to Wahlberg, even the people who are on screen for a total of three seconds are more believable than the title character.I think it's safe to say that if (like me) you're not a fan of the game, a lot of what goes on will feel like slapped-on retreads of earlier, more coherent action or noir films (at one point, I told one of my friends during one scene that the director had certainly seen ""Die Hard."" You'll know the scene when you get to it). Like I said, a lot of the ""intrigue"" or suspense about who is who is kinda obvious to the viewer, even if it takes Payne another two scenes (and endless body count) to figure it out. Basically, the first hour or so is the world's longest flashback, making the last act almost seem thrown in for good measure. It feels rushed and predictably chaotic in a ""crap, we need to get this movie in for under a hundred minutes"" way.It wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that ""Payne"" stripmines the detective genre for clichés that only someone who has never seen a movie before would be surprised by. Someone dies after ripping off another character and thus pinning suspicion on him, another leaves a frantic phone message about meeting up to discuss new details in a cold case and is found murdered in that other guy's home, and it turns out that you can't really trust anyone (of course). Obviously the filmmakers studied the works of the detective genre past; they just didn't bother to do anything new with that.I'm not against video games as movies, I love the ""Spider-Man"" series and would be the first to argue that any art form that's less respected (such as comic books or video games) can occasionally led to a masterpiece if given the chance. ""Max Payne"" is not that kind of a film, it's a blatant cash-grab for the video game fans and a soulless franchise-in-the-making with tie-in merchandising and guaranteed sequels. I think it would be perfect fodder for the MST3K crowd, if the show were still around. As it is, let me offer this pithy assessment: ""Max Payne"" would only be worse if it was Mark Wahlberg starring in ""Thomas Paine<"" and the eighteenth-century pamphleteer also killed Redcoats with incredible firepower.Okay, let me end with this instead: at the end, a patron behind me cried out jokingly ""why, Marky Mark? Why?"" I think everyone who saw the movie was asking the same question. We haven't gotten an answer, though.",Max Payne
265,Tonymjacques,Um...what?,5,18 December 2011,"Okay i'd like to start off by saying I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie simply because i'm such a big fan of the video-games. One of the many problems with this movie, is the cast. For example, in the game it is very clear that Jim Bravura is a chubby old white policeman and in the movie he is portrayed by Ludicrous. And I think that if they wanted to execute Max's role properly they should have just used James McCafferey (Jimmy from Rescue Me, voice of Max Payne). To me it seemed like they were trying to jam pack this movie with a bunch of famous, but not so famous celebrities. Aside from the cast, the plot is very different compared to the games and has a weird storyline. It seemed like the drug 'V' in this film was more important and plot altering than what Max Payne was really about. Another problem I had was the rating. The game is very explicit and has a lot of screwed up things in it which made it a noir type video-game, but however the movie isn't really all that violent, and really goes to show that in this case, the rating matters. Overall my point is, if you haven't played the video-games, you might like it, but if you really like the video-games, you're in for some disappointment. The movie was okay but they could have really done something good with this movie simply by adding a believable cast, fixing up plot holes and making it rated R with a lot more action.",Max Payne
266,jhanke-2,Did anyone who made this film even play the game?,2,18 October 2008,"We know that Mark Wahlberg refused to play Rockstar's ""Max Payne"" game before performing in this film, but, in addition, I must assume that neither the director nor the screenwriter ever played this game before, either. If there weren't so many shots of the background scenery that tied in with the game (although they were never fully or, in some cases, partially explored), I would assume that no one involved in the movie had even seen cut scenes from the game. I would have assumed that they got a one paragraph synopsis on the game, with character names, and just made up their own story that barely connected to the game storyline.When this movie was made for a ""PG-13"" rating instead of an ""R"" rating, most of the fans were nervous. And, after seeing the train wreck this film became, it's clear to see that our worst fears were realized. Worse even than whether this works as a movie adaptation of a video game is whether this film would works as a movie if you have no knowledge of the video game. Unfortunately, if you went to see this film looking for an action flick, you would say that this was one of the most boring, yawn-inducing films you'd seen in the action genre.The lack of narration throughout this film, the lack of a solid action director like John Woo (who knows how to do slow-mo), and the lack of anyone from the Rockstar team helping with screen writing added up to what can only be described as a hollow, dull film that has virtually no tie to the amazing game that spawned it. The studio system strikes again.",Max Payne
267,robert-177,Lots of fun,8,16 October 2008,"Good fun and lots of action and suspense. Stylish and unpredictable. Walhberg didn't play at his best, but more than good enough if you liked him in Shooter. The style of Max Payne reminded me of Sin City, but Sin City is of course a lot better. I think Clive Owen would have made a even better Max Payne, as his character in Sin City has a similar ""mood"" to it. Look out for the two beautiful women Mila Kunis and Olga Kurylenko, they steal the frame in every scene. Amaury Nolasco is great as Lupino, we need to see him in more roles like that. He kind of reminded me of Jason Stratham. Don't except the most solid story in here, but as a pi**ed off policeman Max Payne delivers his rage well enough. 8/10.",Max Payne

270,Asuka_Langley,Max Fail,4,13 October 2008,"So I had tickets for avaunt premiere of max payne so without second thoughts I went to see it. From fun's point of view:I was very enthusiastic about the movie also. Trailers I saw indicate that the movie was going to be very close to what the first game was all about....Oh boy how wrong I was. What was in store for me was 90mins of a movie without meaning or sense to some points. First things first.Atmosphere:, the scenes where so messed up you couldn't actually feel the max payne atmosphere. They where some good scenes and some similarities with the game but only 2-3 scenes, nothing more, all the rest is bad scripting and directing.Acting: Mark Wahlberg seems to have a fever after The Happening, he fails to deliver the expressions of a man who had all the tragedies fall upon him..he was to calm and you know Max Payne can't stay calm! Mila Kunis, fails to deliver as Mona. In the game, Mona played a big role into Max Payne's life, something which don't happen here and Mona play's maybe the smallest part in the movie. I won't say about the villains because its like spoiling the movie. But let me say this, I still don't know if there where any villains at all. You'll see what I mean when you see the movie yourself.Action: When you hear ""Max Payne"" you can only think of one word: ""Massacre"" Shootings here and there, shoot first ask questions later, bodies flying around, and slow motions. OK from a 90 mins movie or so, 10 mins of combined action scenes is unacceptable for Max Payne. If you erase the bullet time you get 8 mins of shooting. All and all the action scenes where good although without blood, they were great and in combination with nice FX. You going to say now, ""okey all good so far but 10 mins of action scenes? are you kidding me? what where they doing in the rest of the film?"" well apparently they where asking questions first and shoot later.Sound: Sound was the best thing about the movie, the sound FX where amazing but even more amazing was the theme, the music was nicely placed into the movie, too bad the movie wasn't good for that music.From a none-fun point of view you might enjoy this film or hate it. But I'm certain you will like it more than those who have played the game.",Max Payne

The main scene settings is within the dark snowy nights. It is gorgeously put together, with snow flakes drifting by slowly, right in the middle of the most intense moments. It feels dark and cold, very cold and that goes with the whole 'revenge' plot. The photography is extremely artistic, and darkly beautiful, especially the gun slinging scenes, which also have superb reverberating sound effects. The plot itself is entertaining, although a little predictive, but I love films for the 'artistic edge' more than the plot itself, and this has that edge, like very few films these days.

The mystery murder of Max's family, a series of strange killings, a glimpse of a supernatural world, a quest to find the truth.But when all the answers were revealed, the result was disappointing. The explanations they came up with were highly improbable, borderline ridiculous. The characters turned out completely shallow, one-dimensional sketches of human beings. What little suspended disbelief they managed to create in the beginning was shattered to pieces when the time came to tie up the loose ends of the story.I spent the final half hour of the movie yawning!",Max Payne
273,thefatguyabouttostealyou,Decent movie,7,18 October 2008,"Here's the biggest problem with the Max Payne movie. The story-line, and the action seem to exist as separate films. One, is a neo-noir detective story, about a man on a quest to find his family's killers, the other is a balls-to-the-wall insane-o action movie. While this combination may have worked in the video-game, it doesn't here, and as a result, the action is not evenly spread out, instead all being crammed into the last half hour, meaning that some viewers may become bored (it's a good 45 minutes before Max kills anyone).Other than that it is a decent movie, with some kick-ass gunfights, nice visuals, and good performances from most of the cast.

Overall, the lighting and camera was excellent. The acting, in general, was pretty good. The plot was good but expressed rather awkwardly. It's as if the director didn't know how to tell this story. Also, the ambiance of the movie keeps changing, which expresses why the movie never actually got really exciting all at once. And finally, the ""red flashes"" and the bullet time was limited, so to speak that the editors were indecisive on how they could portray this movie. Otherwise, the movie was enjoyable.All in all, I WOULD have gave it a 6 or a 7, but since the majority of the people didn't understood the art in this movie, I gave it a more deserving grade.

Though this film was enjoyable it did not follow the source material. The video game had an extremely absorbing story with amazing characters, back stories and depth. The movie could have been a block buster if it had followed the source material more closely. The movie lacked the monologues of the main character 'Max Payne'. In the video game there are many cut-scenes filled with emotional and story driving monologues. Mark Whalberg was very competent in playing Max Payne, though there was much left to desire from Mila Kunis as Mona Sax. All in all, as a movie it was well directed and constructed. As a video game adaptation it is a failure, it makes the same mistakes that many video game to movie adaptation have. The movie strayed way to far from the source material.",Max Payne

Lupino was completely changed and nothing like the game jack Lupino. the fact that Jim bravura was black made no difference so i don't no why everyone is moaning about it.the one thing this film had was atmosphere and fairly good cinematography, other than that it was untrue to the game, watered down and just a plain insult to be truthful. screw u Hollywood",Max Payne

Watch it!!,10,12 February 2010,"Stop listening to people who compare this movie with game, if they would take the story from the game, it would have been a long and boring movie.Gaming is different and movie is different.They reduced the script to make it engaging as a movie. The Max Payne in the movie was brilliant, don't compare him with the one in the game, they are very different.The only character that I feel was not up to the mark was ""Mona Sax"". In short, very bad.The last half of the movie includes the angry part of max payne, not like in game that he is running killing people with strategies, here he is the unafraid man with no fear and ready to blast anyone who comes in his way no matter who he is.You will also see a twist which was not in game but makes the movie a hell lot more better. There is no things like max payne taking datas from computers and stuff instead he makes people tell that the hard way.There are a lot of great things about the movie.Do watch this movie its a very good one. Don't try to surprise yourself if you have already played the game but try to see the brilliance how they converted a good game to a good movie.For those who haven't played the game, this movie is a treat.The open ending with Mona sax showing max payne the newspaper is something to look forward, we might get a sequel.Very good movie, they added everything from game in a few some scenes to make gammers happy, but its not a complete game story, its a better one.Well done to the creators.",Max Payne
279,nintendohero-1,It just didn't work.,5,12 May 2010,"This is my first review so don't hate me.I didn't hate this film. I just found it a complete slap in the face to the game series. If you've played the games and seen this, then you know where I am coming from. I absolutely love the game series. This movie pretty much butchered it to death. Now, for someone who has no clue that this was based (barely) off a game, then, okay. It's an okay action film. Mark Wahlberg is.. well, you know.. Mark Wahlberg. Mila Kunis did an okay Mona Sax. I think it would have been better if the dialog and script weren't so horrible. Everyone else cast doesn't really matter cause they where just put in it for kicks and giggles. I will give it this, the setting of the movie was very Max Payne (game) like. Not the story or anything, but the noirish type atmosphere and the bleak snowy scenes felt very much like the game.The story was completely twisted around and stabbed and burned and tortured from the original story from the game. The trailer even seemed to make it look more like the game. The valkryie drug concept was kinda stupid, but I see what they where trying to get at. Now, Max Payne is famous for it's bullet time action, and I thought they did an okay job in this movie with it. There seemed to be not enough, but then again if they over done it it would be kinda ridiculous. I'm not going to say, ""Stay away from this film!"" but I will say, if you haven't played the games, I suggest playing them before you watch this, and then you'll understand where I come from. The good thing I do have to say about this film is it can be remade into something fantastic.I give it 3 stars for the effort to fail.",Max Payne
280,cre8ed,Totally agree with this review!!,5,15 October 2008,"Sad but true, I just returned from a much previously hyped film VERY disappointed. In a word BORING! I'm fairly forgiving with reviews, I usually give most films the benefit of the doubt especially films based on video games. This film is based extremely loosely on the game. SOME action scenes were cool but most were the same old same old repetitive shoot outs we have seen a thousand times before. The bad guy, I went with a group and we all guessed who it would be as soon as he arrived on the screen. Was this suppose to be deliberate. The acting was so so. If anything this film has definitely increased my desire to see Quantum of Solace thanks solely to Olga the next bond girl. She sizzles on the screen but is unfortunately underused. LUDA-Cris!!! didn't pull off the serious cop routine, he was a lil too cardboard and the fact that I was waiting for a ""AAiigghhhttt"" to come out of his mouth at any second probably didn't improve matters. I will say that it is beautifully shot, the lighting and atmosphere are great. Some may say a little too dark knightish but hey that was always Max's style.My conclusion this gets a big 5 out of 10. I will not be buying the DVD on this one.",Max Payne
281,OMGmyFACE,"Even if you never played the game, this movie is trash.",2,3 April 2011,"I'd like to try being unbiased about this movie but I'm not sure how possible that can be what with my being a huge fan of the video game series. But I'm pretty sure I'd hate this movie even if it weren't based on anything. See, Sam Lake is a good writer. Max Payne, the game, feels like film-noir as told by John Woo. It's satire, making fun of movies and games while also being a very enjoyable experience. The movie version, 7 years later, is... just not. The story is relatively similar despite lots of character, setting, theme, and continuity changes - which is fine because this is best viewed as a ""version"" of Max Payne - but it lacks the number one reason anyone should care about the IP: action-packed violence. This movie has none. That's bad when the only thing going for the movie is ""this is an action movie and people like action movies."" For the first third of the movie, nothing happens. People talk, Mark Wahlberg (who admitted to having not played the game) snarls, junkies have visions of giant bird shadows, repeat. When action DOES show up, it's gone in a blink. No fight choreography, no suspense, no wise-cracking gun-toting NYPD lunatic going ape on people, nothing. If you like quiet ""action"" movies with muted colors and sounds, focusing on setting and mood, you're most likely gonna pass on this anyway for something a little more art-house like The Limits of Control or The American. I wish I could say more about the acting but Wahlberg faxed it in, Ludicrous showed up to collect his paycheck, Mila Kunis just played an angrier version of her character from That 70's Show (not that I mind, she's the best thing about this movie), and why was Robin, The Boy Wonder in this movie again? As for the direction, I don't want to spoil anything for people who are intending on watching this, presumably with friends and liquor, but you can MST3K this whole flick. Here's an example tidbit that doesn't ruin the plot: Max leads a lovely lass to his humble abode to grill info out of her but she wishes to seduce him instead. You see her taking off her top as she slinks into the bedroom and Max follows her. He looks at her and promptly looks away in disgust, as if to convey that he's appalled by her slutty behavior. The camera cuts to the lovely lass who is still wearing her panties but has concealed herself under part of his blanket. He reacts by telling her to ""get out. Get your sh*t and get out."" She then leaves and he makes coffee while wearing his holsters. Wait. Why bring her back to your house in the first place? Why so sensitive and didn't you (a) notice she was on you in the club/(b) expect that to happen when you brought a girl you don't know from a party back to your place? Are you sure you're a cop? It's that, more of that, the hilariously over-acted Lupino scenes (yes, even during his introduction where he has NO LINES), and the fact that all the blood was added digitally in post that makes you wish you were watching Mean Guns instead. At least that movie had Christopher Lambert. However, the main offender is that, in a franchise famous for bringing 'bullet time' to video games, there's one no-buildup filler shootout later in the movie that uses this gimmick very poorly. Movies have emulated Max Payne's abuse of this feature and now the movie based on MP barely uses it once. If you've seen that slo-mo bit in the trailer where Max is leaping with a manila folder, you've actually seen the whole movie.",Max Payne
282,elchamber88,"Weak Story, Bad Acting, Maximum Payne.",6,7 February 2009,"My personal problems with the adaptation is all that damn cameos. Who needs these easily recognizable actors. Is Nelly Furtado and Ludicrous in the soundtrack. But thats not that a problem due to the abundant problems it also has. The next is the effing story. I don't know if it was how it was edited or what, but certain scenes were useless. Three sentences and that's it. I was left wondering why did they have to show that. It's like adding a scene where Max eats, goes to the toilet or takes a nap. Is it really part of the story? And the story suck. Plain and simple. No character arch for all of the main characters and holes are annoying. The one thing I did like... no love about the movie is how lush and beautiful it looks. I always thought that Max Payne would have a gritty, dark look to it, but was accepting to it's clean-cut film noir to it. All-in-all, the movie is, ahhhh, a rental.",Max Payne

There were a lot of scenes not shown in the movie, but it would be very difficult to include everything from an 8 hour game into a 90 minute movie. There were times during the game when I would get goosebumps, and there were a couple of times during the movie when I also felt the same goosebumps. Mark Wahlberg captured the feeling of Max very well, and the overall ""Film Noir"" feel carried from the film excellently. I missed Captain Batboy, however. Overall, it was an awesome movie. Faithful to the game, yet entertaining if you haven't played the game. 9 stars.",Max Payne

He seemed to have bad acting in the movie too.Second, the movie is not like the game. Max's wife in the movie looked nothing at all like his wife in the video game. The storyline is very different in the movie than the game. Major things happen in the movie that aren't in the game.The movie is just boring too. Action scenes are few and far between. The talking scenes are tedious.I really wonder how this movie even got approved to be released... I take it no one involved with the movie played the game before, since it's obviously not like the game.Overall, this is about one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Jesus! I admit, wahlberg's expression looks very much like max's. but everything else is just another character. not to mention that they invented everything else but the characters and the locations of the original story. that story was so damn good, i've been dreaming for years for it to become film noir. now somebody will just have to remake it cuz this just will not do! and that is the sorriest most pathetic excuse of a lupino i've ever seen. God! THE FLESH OF FALLING ANGELS! ruined... i wish that the real max payne would just show up and put a slow motion bullet straight in the head of whoever is responsible for shattering such an opportunity at a master piece along with every max payne veteran's expectations. and no more Christmas cards for mark wahlberg",Max Payne
286,Godstud,Slow moving & dull,3,17 October 2008,This is one of the few movies I have ever dozed off to. I am a big fan of action movies and I was supremely disappointed in this slow moving (no action til about 1/2 way through the movie) and Olga Kurylenko was one of the few bright spots an otherwise dull movie. The sets and atmosphere were good but fight against the bad guy was a let down with the ending utterly predictable. The action was standard and nothing better than a recent Steven Seagal movie. The trailers made the movie out to be more than it was and I am a person who turned the channel to avoid seeing the trailers for fear of getting the whole plot before seeing the movie. I was hyped up to see this movie and feel like I was robbed. Save your money and see one of the other action movies to come out lately. You won't be disappointed with Eagle Eye or Body of Lies.,Max Payne

Nobody can play the troubled Max Payne better than Mark Wahlberg. While starting out slow and explaining Max's story, the last forty five to fifty minutes are full of action that will pump you up and want more. I didn't think the hallucination demons were needed in the film, but all round, a well crated film with a good story, plot, and good acting from Wahlberg. Sexy Mila Kunis did a good job as Mona Sax, but the film should have explained what the heck happened to her when she got on to the elevator. The Bond girl did an OK job, as she was barely in the film. But as i have stated before... a great movie that will keep your heart pumping from start to finish.",Max Payne
289,MasterMegid,May Cause Max Payne...For The Viewer,1,14 March 2009,"I did not expect much going in to watch Max Payne. Films based on video games are almost never any good. Yet some how this film managed to be worse, than even I thought possible.For starters the cast sucks. That's as nicely as I can put it. Not a single actor does a good job here. From Mark Wahlburg's painful version of the title character, to the 19 year old Meg Griffin, er, I mean, Mila Kunis, is somehow supposed to be a femme feat ale, assassin. Furthermore, why is Ludicrous even in this? He only has like two scenes, and sucks anyhow as Jim Bravura.I enjoyed the Max Payne video games, but this film is completely devoid of anything from the game franchise except for the title. And even had I not played the game, I still would not have enjoyed this poorly made clap-trap.The non-sensical plot(Yeah, I made up a word so what?) is only broken up by a few action scenes. Which were all poorly shot, and boring to watch, drying paint is more entertaining! The icing of the cake has to be that the film is PG-13. Why when the game is M, which is the equivalent of ""R"", for those who don't know. And John Moore, is a jackass, untalented hack, that insults the excellence of, ""The Dark Knight"" to defend this load of rubbish.Max Payne, is simply one of the worst films, that I have ever seen. Keep in mind that I have seen hundreds of films including stinkers like, Spider-Man 3, Resident Evil, Dead lake, and Plan 9 From Outer Space! Avoid this one unless of course you are some sort of masochist.",Max Payne
290,docent-3,Huge disappointment. But what would you expect?,5,30 April 2009,"I enjoyed both video games and I was intrigued to find out that a movie adaptation is in the works, especially with Mark Wahlberg casted as Max Payne. Having recalled a multitude of paltry video game adaptations, I still hoped that ""maybe this time it will be different"". It wasn't.The movie lacks certain key elements that made the game so enjoyable. There was no equivalent of great cut-scene voice-overs that made the game movie-like. There was no ever present dark humor.As for the positives, I must commend on the cinematography which is pleasing for the eye and reminds me a little of Sin City.Unfortunately, the script is utterly weak and predictable, the dialogue often unnatural. There is very little character development. Some performances are adequate while others extremely weak. Particularly Mila Kunis was not too convincing as Mona Sax. All in all I find this movie a completely wasted effort. What might have been one of the first solid video game adaptation was ruined by mediocre script and poor acting.",Max Payne
291,atredbaron,Did anyone actually play the game?,1,22 October 2008,"Imagine an awesome video game with an awesome story....that was not this. I loved the Max Payne games, I knew it wouldn't be the same as the game and I expected the directors to take liberties; but this? The only thing that bore any resemblance to the game was the title and names in the movie.I actually wished Max Payne had shot me halfway through this. I was incredibly bored by an unbelievably slow story line which really failed to offer anything interesting and completely missed the ""film noir"" style of the game. At times it even became stereotypically cheesy! There was no connection at all with the characters; and for a game that focused on immersing you and having you empathize with the main characters, and I was very aware that I was watching a movie.Bullet time (a main tenet of the game) was hardly used and when it was, it was completely off: it was like someone accidentally hit the bullet time button at the wrong time and then realized they had to finish a fight in normal speed while it recharged! Plot holes abound. CG effects were like the cutting-room floor of Constantine, and for a movie about an action game, there really was very little action.I feel like this movie was made by someone who sat down to read the strategy guide (with the ""bullet time"" instruction page ripped out)and said ""hey! I get the gist of this!"" If I could have I would have left early (didn't drive).",Max Payne
292,sartrix,Actually quite a faithful translation,7,17 January 2009,"I have heard and read a lot of bad reviews about this movie, and when my girlfriend wanted to watch it anyway, we feared for the worst. Glad to say: we feared in vain! Both of us have played the games, tho in my case I never managed to get hooked on part 2. No matter, since the movie just covers part 1.A lot of reviews mention how things are missing from this movie, like bullet time slow-mo's, gore, and narration. But to be frank, we didn't miss anything really. In fact it HAS gore, slow-mo's (good ones even, without looking like a matrix rip-off) and narration. Just not through the entire movie, just like it doesn't have shooting through the entire movie. People.. a movie is not filming how some one goes through the game shooting people one by one. A movie actually tries to focus some more on the actual story! It's quite well compressed from the many hours of game-play to the few hours a motion picture can be.And that story was done fine. It was faithful to the game safe for some minor acceptable liberties, and solid enough as stand-alone for those who didn't play the game as well. The only confusing thing was the '1 week earlier' flashback which starts the movie and lasts well over an hour of the movie's total time. The mention of the dead wife in the prologue's narration can put viewers on the wrong track thinking it's 1 week before those deaths. However, once the scene comes which clearly shows which part was actually the flashback, it suddenly falls into place.The end of this flashback is the turning point of the movie from storytelling to solid action. I have no peeves with the action, aside of the endless clips of ammo. Never reloading is a common thing in movies, and by far not the worst to happen.The atmosphere and build up was absolutely great. Grim, gritty and cold. The junks and bodies everywhere from the skipped plowing of the early stages in the game, makes place for visuals of how the drug Valkyr is being experienced. A slight change of scope from 'yet another gore movie' to actually elaborating more on the substance that's cause of everything. Had they kept the hellish scenes in junkie apartments, then they'ld have lost the contrast with the drug's effects, and therefor it's a perfectly good choice.In closing, I'ld like to add that I've lost my confidence in the IMDb ratings and reviews as they've proved wrong yet another time. It's seriously better as many other action movies which get a 7+ rating like the failed Transporter 2.",Max Payne
293,kountxero,Quite a 'pain' I must admit...,1,15 June 2009,"Well, the long-awaited and perhaps inevitable movie adaptation of Max Payne, the legendary video game, is here. Right off the bat, let me tell you this: I loved the games. I KNEW the games and I understood them. Which is exactly why my rating is a single star.Most people would argue that judging a film adaptation in comparison with the game is unfair: I beg to differ. If this wasn't an 'adaptation', maybe THAT would be so, but since it isn't, there is the question of how well it translated the game into a different medium. I don't expect the entire game to be rendered scene-by-scene into a movie (as it would require 3 separate movies just to get through the first game), but I also don't expect an incoherent piece of trash that doesn't accomplish anything; not even by its own merits.Max Payne the Movie is a garbled mess of familiar elements from the game thrown together to make up for the lack of plot and logical plot progression; while the game had a good plot that at least made the player want to advance, the movie has none. The movie takes almost nothing from the games, which means: no voice-overs, seven total characters from the game, none of which is in character, no solid plot, no progression, NO shootouts, no action, no melancholy, no nothing. The revenge theme is so absent that it might as well have been omitted. The lack of action makes an action-based game adaptation look lackluster, especially when there is no plot to speak of. The only 'action' you get is two to three extremely slow-mo shoot-outs that last for about five seconds. There are some interesting visuals, especially with the bullet-time effects, but that isn't enough and is often used to defy the laws of physics as opposed to give a good visual show. All the action movie clichés are piled up together, hoping to make a plot, but it doesn't hold.As I am talking about the plot, let me put it this way: Max Payne is a NYPD cop. He's working in the Cold Case Unit. We don't know why he does until the middle of the film (granted, those who played the game do know). He is working a case with clues so obvious that there is no suspension of disbelief, save for ours, since we disbelieve any one man can be that stupid. Then, a bunch of yarns get spun, none of them is concluded, nobody does anything about anything, people hallucinate about giant man-birds (supposedly Valkyries) and the movie ends. That's seriously about how it goes. No, I'm not joking. That's IT. There is no mystery: not because you've played the game, but because the 'whodunit' portion is so obviously in-your-face that you don't need the movie to show you what's what. It's a bunch of overdone, tired clichés thrown together and put in a big ball of yarn that lessens as the movie goes along.I can go on for hours, analyze every aspect of this movie that is bad, but it would be pointless. So, instead, I'll cut short and give a small list of the pros and cons of this movie as a conclusion: Positive Bits: Premise (i.e. 'Max Payne the Movie'), the name 'Max Payne' that is unfortunately attached to it, Mike Walhberg is a good choice for the lead, some good visuals.Negative Bits: EVERYTHING ELSE IMAGINABLE. NO EXCEPTIONS.",Max Payne
294,nonperson104,Leaves plenty to be desired,6,22 October 2008,"When playing the original Max Payne game, i found myself amazed at the incredible emphasis placed on the plot and atmosphere, unlike other games of its kind. Everything just seemed to be right about the game.When the movie was released, i was skeptical. I knew that it could work, and could be a potentially brilliant film. But i also knew that it just couldn't be done. The second i heard that Mila Klunis would be accompanying Whalberg in the title role i was immediately bitter. After all, how could the cold as ice Mona Sax possibly be portrayed by the same person who plays Meg on family guy? But all doubts aside, i was surprised at the end result. There was the right amount of action: not too much as to blow everything out of the water, and not too little as to deny the games original premise. These scenes are all filmed quite well. I was hoping for a bit more atmosphere, and although a lot of people may tell you it's very atmospheric, a lot of factors bring this down. The second rate acting, second rate script and second rate cinematography had me cringing so many times throughout the movie.Max Payne is a solid film/noir action film that captures the mood of the game pretty well. But so many things about it could have been improved upon, and if only they were, Max Payne could have been so much better.",Max Payne
295,andrew-imrie,Why such a bad rap?,7,21 January 2009,"Why does everyone pan this film so hard? The special effects were really well done. The atmosphere and imagery of the film was sensational. Wahlberg did a really good job and the action scenes (although they weren't as plentiful as they should have been) were unique and impressive. The mixture of paranormal and terrestrial action was as well balanced as the game.Admittedly, the story line was somewhat predictable and a little forced, but it what can you really expect for an action flick based on a video game?!

The eight dollar and fifty cents I paid however was enough to keep me hoping for a turning point. Unfortunately it never came, and I left the theater wishing I had never gone. I have never played the game and I was confused as to what exactly was going on for the majority of the movie. The plot gave birth to an excruciatingly over used, B rated story line that involved some invention that is injected into soldiers to make them super strong, and then all goes wrong.

The cast it could be better, so the story, but it's OK. I didn't had a bad time, I enjoyed watching it.Its a very very good movie to rent when you don't know what else to see and you already viewed all the action movies like the Bourne trilogy.I don't think that its worthy to see in the cinema except you are a Max Payne follower and you already know the story.There are some goofs from the game but not so much, and the scenes where you see Max fighting to save his family his house is preety much changed.

I've played the game and I thought it was okay. It seemed more like the Matrix games than anything original, but I digress. I was wowed by the film in the way they actually made it a story and make you actually care for the main character. That hasn't happened for me since the first Mortal Kombat film, but then the second one sucked so bad I almost cried.The only reason I didn't rate this higher is that the film takes at least 20 mins to really get going, but after that it sucks you right in. I loved the whole soldiers taking a liquid drug to make them feel invincible to the whoever they were at war with, which sometimes feels like that could be coming around the corner any day now. When the head bad guy starts acting like he's some kind of god from the drugs I started thinking ""Can't wait till Payne kicks his Ass!"" As a story, I think it is a clever mystery story including fabled occult beliefs from the Norse mythology and when Max starts seeing them after taking the drug to get to the bad guys is pretty friggin' sweet.

300,dengee34,"too late, too bad",3,12 January 2009,"The film is based on the game max Payne. The game was a big success in the July 2001. Now after the game have been out for many years they created the max Payne movie. The movie is really approximating the game; they included bullet time as from the game, they included even the sounds when the clock ticks authentically as in the game. Also when the movie begins you identify the subway level as is the first level in the game. Allot of concepts and materials are taken from the game; the loading screens for example. When something new develops in the movie, like a new day you see varying screen of New York as in the game. So. This movie is not bad at all and the actor is so-so, not to good sometimes but we should not forget it is a movie based on a GAME. one thing that I did not like in the movie is the angels of death. Why did they made angels? looks cool but it is funny due to there, never been any angels in the original game. I think they are unnecessary in the movie also the movie would be so much better without them. I cannot say anything good about this movie because there is nothing to say. It could be so much better if they skipped the angels, made less investigation and talk scenes and included more action. Action because it is what we like to see and it is an action movie based on action game. The movie looked well because they could recreate and bring in the dark noir-style. And picked the right actor for max Payne; but all the other things, Not at all. really bad produced.

301,dgmcafee-1,This film inspired me to finally join IMDb and start writing reviews...,2,2 February 2009,"It inspired me because I have never been more unhappy with a movie that I expected to actually be somewhat good. I simply don't understand how a script could be made that was this horrible. It would be one thing if the writers came up with a completely new concept with new characters and everything, but they didn't. They simply had to adapt a video game into a movie, and it is my opinion that they failed.It is impossible to feel anything for any character (maybe excluding the main character's) because they come and go with no real explanation or depth. The death of Lupino was so anti-climactic that I thought he would still be alive or something. Maybe this was also credited to the fact that he took a bullet to the chest but didn't bleed. Then, what happened after Mila Kunis' character got into the elevator? I spent the majority of this movie in laughter because I didn't know how else to try to enjoy myself.The only reason that I would give it two stars is because of the CGI which led to some interesting moments. In the end I am left feeling nothing but disappointment towards Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis for accepting roles in such a mistake of a movie.",Max Payne

But it would've been a lot better if it was based exactly off the video game. Such as Max Payne fighting with the dual hand guns, popping painkillers, getting shot up more, and more bullet time sequences. They could've gotten a better actor to cast as Max Payne too. I'd say Mel Gibson would've been a good Max Payne. He's got a bass toned voice similar to Max Payne's. Mark Wahlberg's voice was kind of shy and quiet in the movie. Mel Gibson resembled Max Payne in Lethal Weapon 4 when he had short hair, wore the leather jacket, and fought with a hand gun. Mila Kunis (Jackie) did a very well job as Mona Sax.",Max Payne

The film was well cast also, Mark Wahlberg in particular was impressive, with supporting actors also performing well, even Ludicrous as Lt. Jim Bravura was okay, despite my initial skepticism.The criticisms are much stronger however. In simple terms, the plot, especially when compared to the quality of the game, is flawed, with limited character development and key plot elements from the game overlooked the main criticisms. Without giving too much away, in terms of emotional involvement, the characters was disappointing. None of the main characters evoked any sympathy or emotion from me (unlike the game) and the villains were conspicuous in their relative absence. There are limited action scenes, and again trying not to give anything away, even the pivotal scenes towards the conclusion of the film end somewhat quickly compared to what you may expect from a film noir. This leads to the main fundamental fault of the film, in that it is way too short. For the amount of opportunities and great scenes and plot elements that the game provides, 90 minutes is disgraceful.I suppose, for the people who haven't played the games, Max Payne might turn out to be a mildly enjoyable run-of-the-mill action film. For the others who have played the games, and are the people who will make up the majority of the audience in my opinion, Max Payne falls short. The film never at any point emulates the sense of enjoyment and immersion that the game provides and once again makes the same mistakes that other film adaptations of games have made.",Max Payne
307,aktunka,What were they thinking at the studio?,3,2 November 2008,"I just saw this film and I would not recommend it. The plot just barely relates to the Max Payne world from the video game without having any of the actual intriguing plot points. From the beginning, the movie feels disjointed and incoherent going from one interesting looking scene to another with nothing tying them together. Towards the end of the movie, the main female character behaves in a way towards Max that is completely out of sync with the way she has interacted with him throughout the rest of the show, and there is nothing that has happened that would indicate this would be a likely turn of events.That being said, I don't think the actors did a really bad job, I think that the problem here lies mostly in the screenplay, directing, and editing. Having the film limited to a PG-13 rating probably did not help either since the game it is based on is a very dark piece. I feel that they would have been much better off going for a more surreal feeling and having it almost mirror the game itself. It would have at least made more sense that way.",Max Payne
308,abcdefghmnzx-352-964589,Finnish game was better!!!,4,24 April 2012,"Graphically, the film has ​​some very nice scenes. The angel sequences are awesome, the angels are animated great. These scenes are all the more as they settle in the color scheme from the rest of the film. The film is deliberately somber, almost kept black and white, with long hard shadows. The Angels are the only sequences contain warm colors of the film. The film is very much on its looks, but the story does not, unfortunately for me, not by far.From the moment that the explanation will be informed of the angels of the air out of the story. The film is available as only a seasoned cop-takes-revenge Strip. That will not get better that apparently for the German market was very squinted at the intersection of the FSK12 release. The actors do not tear the film out. Olga Kurylenko, who has liked in Hit-man has a minor role here, Mila Kunis and Wahlberg can not convince was sometimes even better.Too bad you did Max Payne out to make more, maybe more would have to walk the path towards Constantine.",Max Payne
309,bmward-83027,Max Payne put me through pain....,4,9 November 2017,"I finished watching Max Payne last night after having to start and stop it a couple of times due to other things being much more important than watching it. Needless to say, I think I understand why Mark Wahlberg's face looked like it did throughout the movie...he was in pain too.Of course, this movie has been out for 9 years now...so why watch it now...I think mostly it was because I had it on my long list, and finally had a few minutes here and there to waste. I'm a gamer, and Max Payne (as well as it's shorter sequel Max Payne 2) stand out for me as milestones in my gaming history. The presentation and development of Max's character and backstory were top-notch and the ending was gratifying, not to mention all of the action in between. Based on Hollywood's game adaption history, I wasn't expecting much at all from this, although Wahlberg is one of my favorite go-to actors when I just want to see good action. Wahlberg tries really hard to bring Max's grit, pain, and determination to the screen, but he just never quite captures it. Most of the movie he tries pulling a Stallone in First Blood, rarely speaking, and when he does, the dialogue is terse and unemotional. Mila Kunis tries really hard to come off as a sexy but streetwise woman with a rough edge but all I kept waiting for was for her to either start talking about Jim Beam or cracking a joke. Trying to not compare her to the Mona in the game was more difficult than Wahlberg as Max.Beau Bridges...well, I'm not even going there. I think the only reason he still gets acting jobs is because of who his dad was. Ludicrous's portrayal as Lt Bravura was laughable to say the least...and Chris O'Donnell's Jason Colvin...he must have needed mortgage money at the time (it was before NCIS:LA...).The effects are so-so, and the ""homage"" to bullet-time was pretty ludicrous...you'll see what I mean when it happens. I just had to roll my eyes.I had to force myself to watch this because I'm not going to let a movie beat me. I mean, if I can sit through Leonard Part 6, I can handle anything right?",Max Payne
310,barnsb,Max Payne Review,7,15 October 2008,"First thing i should mention is that i have played the games and enjoyed them very much. I would rate them as my favorite game(s) of all time. So taking that into account, you can probably guess that my expectations were high, although not in the way of special effects and amazing performances. All i really wanted out of the film was for the storyline to stay solid and not to stray too much, unfortunately that is exactly what it did. The look of the sets and locations were quite good, and the acting was fine by my standards (taking into account my primary expectations). The major flaw was the exclusion of key characters which was always going to led directly to a change in the storyline all fans of the game know and love.For those who have not played the game, i imagine the acting performances and special effects would be a major part of the overall satisfaction, rather then the actual storyline. All i will say is i could understand someone stating they disliked the film based on the acting performances/special effects. This is not to say that these people would dislike the storyline also, that is definitely a possibility for the non-gamers.I don't really want to give this film a score, although you can probably guess a range it would lie between based on my opinion.Thanks for reading.",Max Payne
311,excalibur316,"""Max Payne"" is just one big disappointment.",4,18 October 2008,"I had really high hopes for this movie, but if you are a big fan of the Max Payne games as I am, then you will find the movie adaptation to be just one big disappointment of a movie.The movie starts off with the characters vaguely explaining Max's backstory, and how ""dangerous"" and ""dark"" he is. They do this so much that it gets dragging and really boring. Then Max moves onto following leads with no short backstory on how he got to those people or why he was going to a particular place.This movie is just really scattered in terms of the storyline and character development. For a movie highly promoted as an action film, this movie barely has any. It's all just Max's emotion-less face and everyone telling the audience how depressed he is.The characters are another thing that annoyed me in this movie, everything was just so scattered, I can't even begin to explain.Overall, if you're a regular movie-goer, then you won't enjoy. And if you are a fan of the game, then you won't like this at all.4/10",Max Payne
312,Wolven_StarScream,Murky and jumbled but still a decent action movie,7,18 October 2008,"I have never played the Max Payne games, so I have no idea if the movie was faithful to its origins. I've heard some people say that it was and others say it wasn't. But in any case, this really wasn't as bad as everyone seems to think. No, there wasn't as much action as you might get in a ""Transporter"" movie, but that didn't really bother me because sometimes I like movies that have a little more thought behind them. There were still some really awesome action sequences though and it was definitely beautifully shot. The atmosphere that they created with the lighting was great.However, there were still some things that I didn't like about this movie and that they could have done better. First, most of it, especially the beginning, seemed very jumbled and hard to understand. The writing and the editing were sub-par. Second, and this is probably due to the bad writing and editing, you never really connect with any of the characters and so you can never really feel any overwhelming emotion about their situation. The whole thing seemed slightly hollow and empty, as if the writer and director themselves were not quite sure what they were trying to get at. Third, the acting sucked big time in some scenes. It wasn't horrible throughout the whole movie, but it still left much to be desired. Fourth, there were many things in the story that weren't fully explained, which only contributed to the hollow, confused feeling of the entire movie.So, overall, it is not a bad film, but I was slightly disappointed. It really could have been an amazing movie, and I blame the writer and editor for almost completely ruining it. The only thing that saves it is the few awesome action scenes and the cinematography. But please don't believe anyone that says it one of the worst movies ever because it's not. It's just not as good as it should have been.7.5/10",Max Payne
313,ult_avatar,"Good premise, bad execution",1,7 June 2012,"In short: They changed almost everything that was the Game ""Max Payne"" and made a mediocre detective Story with mystery and CGI for teens. Let me elaborate:As a fan of the first installment of the game I can only condemn this screen adaptation.I know the different mechanics of consummation of Film and Game well enough to realize that it is not going to be the same content on the screen as on the monitor. However, to see the story and presentation changed so completely was an awful surprise.The premise looked promising: At least two A-Class Actors and the dark and sinister tone of the Game seemed to be present. Big budget, no Uwe Boll.After watching this I can only feel deeply disappointed. In my opinion they kept almost nothing true to the Game. The following points are essential to what 'Max Payne' is, as content: Max Payne is not constantly gulping Painkillers - not ONCE in the entire Movie.There are only two very short ""Bullet Time"" sequences - which was THE MAJOR THING in the game. Max is dressed very different. He is looking much more serious and well balanced in the Movie. He never goes ""akimbo"" (using two guns at the same time). They cut out the nightmare sequences - which felt like at least 1/4 of the game. They left out the voice-over done by himself - which is also major in the game. Also too much of the Movie takes place during the day - the Game took place only during the course of one night, I believe. They changed some of the Major plot points and characters around and invented some.They changed the administration of the Drug (V for Valkyre) from injection to oral. This makes the graffiti tag of a stylized syringe crossed with the letter V - which they kept true to the game - just absurd. How is someone supposed to get the hint that these tags mean Max is entering enemy territory ? They don't even call the drug ""V"" in the Movie!He is not constantly getting shot at. How can they change that ? The game was a 3rd Person Shooter. Not a Action Adventure. Thats like a movie adaption of ""GTA"" without constant car jacking and car chases.Because of the above points I don't think this movie is to be recommended. Although the acting is sound and there are no technical mistakes.At last I have to pity the aspiring actors Ludicrous and Nelly Furtado. Both of their characters felt artificial and unfitting. Not because of their performance: Ludicrous gave it his all, but his cool and quipping cop did not fit the story and tone of the Movie. And I can't even judge Nelly's performance because she only got about three sentences and 30 seconds screen time - I think there were more shots of Olga's body parts.",Max Payne
314,boscosburgarrrs,Payneful to Watch,1,18 October 2008,"I don't know how they did it but somehow the makers of this film managed to suck all the cool out of the title Max Payne. This film was just boring, dull, flat out lackluster. Moments leading up to the action were necessary yes but felt deluded, watered down.When action scenes actually did come they were good I'll admit, but brief too brief! What made the video game so cool was the voice over, the narrative by the main character Max Payne himself. His persona in the game was so dark, cold, a brave man on a mission.This film lost all of that coolness, that darkness, that grit, that grind it out, tough guy feel the games had. Now I understand people will say that a direct translation would be difficult and pointless for those of whom played the game.However Sin City did that with monstrous success so I don't see why not. This is one of the films where a direct translation would have been good. They weren't quite able to take the elements that made that game so cool and parlay that onto the big screen. Maybe when I make it big in Hollywood I can do a proper adaptation of this awesome video game...or somebody could just figure out ""hey ya know what? I don't think we should stray that far away from the original content"" I mean look at how awful the Resident Evil series turned out!",Max Payne
315,james-pink-1,oh my god what happened,3,5 April 2009,"No spoiler here - it doesn't need one, its already spoiled!OK so I am biased, having played both games to completion several times over I loved them both - dark, gritty, twisted, film noir greatness. the games, as most will no doubt know, were almost a scripted story board that was ready to go as a movie - seriously it should have been easy - don't bother with script writers - the script was already there, the games are a screen play! even down to camera angles and lighting - it should have been a no brainer. I would love to know what would have happened in the production crew and actors had actually played the game, but alas I suspect they had a treatment to work with and they just ran with that - Mark was an awesome choice for the role of Max but there it stops. My big question is if your going to make a film of a great game why risk alienating the original fan base by not sticking with the already existing story line and instead running with an ""off the shelf"" plot (that was on the shelf for a good reason - it sucked!) and just putting in the appropriate names.So whats next? do we have to now watch as Hollywood works it's way through more games - maybe Halflife? or Deus Ex - both could make awesome films but if this is what they are going to do with them why bother.Simply put if your going to make a movie from an award winning game that sold in the millions - STICK WITH THE f*&KING STORY! games designers spend a lot of time making great games with great stories - gamers spend a lot of time enjoying them where the hell does some half arsed hack of a director get off knocking out crap like this. Yes its a given you name a film after a game with this sort of following and it will sell seats in the cinema - but do a good job of it- stick to the story and it will be a blockbuster! - it can be done - they said that Lord of the Rings and The Watchmen couldn't be done - but they were and were fantastic - granted they aren't games but the principle is the same - you research the material of the story before you make the film - get some of the original artists and creative producers involved instead of knocking out crap like this, it's not fair on the fans - and thats who the film is made for surely - do it well and they will market the game via word of mouth far better than any amount of trailers and hype will ever do and that means more money for the producers, I really don't understand why you would do it any other way.",Max Payne
316,peter1885,John Moore Murdered Max Payne,5,15 October 2008,"I played both games and finished them so I know what to expect from Max Payne.In the game Max is always talking to himself (in his mind) telling the player what he is thinking in a stylish comic book way. This never happens in the movie. Mark Wahlberg did a good job of portraying Max but John Moore really just toned down this movie for no reason and made it a really big let down. Even the Action scenes were poorly done.All of the shooting scenes were horribly done. The movie is very slow paced and a lot of it just feels like it could have done better. Max Payne has never been about violence but there is no reason why this was made the way it was.Fans of the game will get some pleasure out of this but the majority will be disappointed. People who have never played the game will be bored after 20 to 30 minutes into the movie.Don't see this at the Cinama if you think you can wait, rent it.This is just another poorly done game to movie adaption.",Max Payne

There were major plot points that brought laughter and derision from the Austin Film Festival screening audience.The sparse dialog is often trite, and as for character development, don't hold your breath.Give the movie a miss, and just play the game.

318,simonchinnock,terrible film,1,20 November 2008,"As a fan of the games i guess i was expecting more. The story in the games played out very much like a movie; with the way it developed the main characters, the way it presented one man's quest for revenge and ultimately closure in the backdrop of a harsh New York winter's night. You didn't get this sense from the movie at all. I don't think it was Mark Wahlberg's fault; it was more the half assed script and the average to poor production values. The film lacked any kind of real character development, which is surely something essential to story telling. Wahlberg's character was the only one that showed any real evidence of this, and even then it perhaps wasn't brought out enough. The action sequences and some of the effects were so overdone and it almost seemed that the film makers banked on these crappy scenes to maintain interest in the film. As im sure you gather, this is a mindless action film and the worst Marky Mark has ever done. It was so bad people started playing with their phones and leaving the cinema half way in to the movie.

I don't know about everyone else, but the movie has the exact story. Not everything happens when it should or people aren't where they should be, such as Mona's sister, or the woman from Aesir, or Alex, but the main storyline is there.I enjoyed watching the movie, it was better than what I was expecting, and yea I'm a little disappointed it wasn't a complete rendition of the game, but I won't let that ruin my time watching it.

I have seen people play it and I thought this movie would make to the big screen one day. When I heard of it, I was first expecting the director Uwe Boll to be behind it, when I saw he wasn't I thought this movie has potential. The trailers looked amazing, and that is how the movie turned out. The movie was slow to begin with, at one point I was ready to just leave because nothing was happening. Then the first shoot out showed up and I was hooked. The slow motion scenes make a very nice appearance, and were very well done. I am glad they were as this was one thing that made the game so great. After the boring nature of the first half comes the second half where you are blown out of your mind with intense action sequences and unexpected twists. While this is although a great movie, Silent Hill still holds the title of the bet video game movie ever. Some people liked it, some don't, that is what the reviews say at least.

This is why watching this movie felt like torture.This is probably the greatest example on how to turn a success into a disaster. How can you make a story so bad, when you already have a story, characters, look, and everything else from the game. The writers and/or director found a way to remove almost all the action, something the Max Payne games is known for. The look, set dressing, and acting works fine, but the story completely overshadows the things they got right. For me the greatest thing in this film is the environment and look, that brings up a lot of good memories from the game. But this is not enough to save this painfully bad movie.I heard that Mark W. said in a interview that he never played the game, and didn't think this was necessary in order to play the part in the movie...what an lazy approach to a highly paid job.",Max Payne
322,stevenray72,Revenge isn't for the timid...,4,3 November 2010,"In my book a revenge flick should go straight for the jugular. These flicks should never be restricted by kid friendly ratings,either.Take Mad Max, for example.Now THATS a revenge flick!Ditto for Death Wish. Hell, even The Punisher is a decent revenge flick. Max Payne isn't fit to polish any of those films gun barrels. Based on the popular(and from what I hear,more violent) 2001 video game of the same name.Max Payne(Mark Wahlberg)is a loner detective seeking to avenge the mysterious murders of his wife and child. Along the way,he enlists the help of a professional assassin.This assassin is played by Mila Kunis(Forgetting Sarah Marshall.)Kunis makes for nice eye candy but has got to be one of the more diminutive and least threat hing hit-women I've seen in a long while.Moving on, Max uncovers a secret project being conducted by the pharmaceutical company that his late wife worked for.Said project involves supplying special energy drugs to soldiers to make them fearless in battle. An unfortunate side effect of the drug is that it may(read-it will)cause you to have have visions of demons stalking you in the night. I guess every drug has side effects but damn!!Payne will find those behind the production of this experimental drug,the subsequent cover up and how it may all tie into the murders of his family. One thing the film does have is a sense of style. Set in a noir-sh city,where it seems that the snow is forever falling.This snowbound landscape most reminded me of the final act of Sin City.I was also reminded of a criticism leveled at certain detail-obsessed filmmakers over the years. The criticism of ""style over substance"". Critics often make this charge against filmmakers like Ridley and Tony Scott,David Fincher and Robert Rodriquez.To name just a few.However,to label John Moore(The Omen remake)as this type of director would be an insult to many directors whose style DOES have some substance.Moore's direction here is devoid of any visible soul.The script is labored with clichés(corporate cover ups,friends turned enemies)and the action is boring and bloodless.This film could have been produced by a computer for all of the emotion and personality it displays.That is to say,none.",Max Payne

The script didn't develop the main character but rather confused us and ruined the story with these unexplained hallucinations Angels or Demons or whatever, adding those creatures didn't add to the script but made it more confusing although the original story was pretty simple, a typical avenge story.i think the movie script, direction and even acting weren't up to hopes!I have to admit that i loved one character Natasha, a role played by Olga Kurylenko... although her part was small & was added for no strong reason, She was Hot! hope to see more of her in other moviesMy advise, don't see it.....

People, realize that a movie cannot do in two hours what a game does in TEN! Of course, a lot of important characters where left out (like 2 come on)the movie cannot last all week. If your waiting on game based movie which develops as good of a story as the game does your insane. It's the same case with books. Honestly, I do not understand why somebody who has played the game wouldn't love the movie. Did you guys want another Blood Rayne movie or something? I thought the action sequences did the game justice, come on the game is like 6 years old and your gonna complain about the movies effects?The acting was decent, Marky Mark should do more roles like this and less of a biology professor that fights plants bent on destroying human life. Nothing Oscar worthy, yet show me the movie that falls under the action genre that has that. (if you say sin city your a moron)The biggest let down was the plot however. I won't insult the movie over it because it did what an action movie does, ENTERTAINS! The movie took the games story and summarized it, yes, kinda dumbed it up a bit, made things more predictable, but it had to otherwise it would have went 1 mile an hour for 3 days straight.In the end, if your a Max Payne the video game lover, don't watch this; chances are you won't understand the point I made. If your one of the people who complained about the new Rambo because you actually went to see Rambo expecting a masterpiece script, do not watch this movie.

The casting was very well done, and the action scenes were really good too (with the slowing down of time in some scenes). The plot remained mostly the same, but some of the stuff in the game I thought was really good wasn't in the movie.Here are some of the things I didn't like: I didn't like the introduction of all the characters, except for Max, which was pretty good. I wished he worked for the DEA like he did in the game. They should've spent a little more time in the subways. There should've been more ""bad guys"" like he killed in the actual game. And above all, I missed the on going monologue in Max's head.I did though like the addition of the Valkyrie scenes (when they were actually on the drugs and could see them flying about).This movie would have been a lot better if they followed the game in every detail, but I'll still give it an 8/10.",Max Payne

329,npvbrukout,Max Payne without any of the charm...at all,4,27 October 2008,"May contain one or two spoilers!! When I found out they were making a film based on the game I was in two minds about it. If they managed to capture the sheer dark, sinister, and deeply poetic nature of the game (which in my opinion is what made it as good as it was) following the evermore tortured mind of Max, then it could have been one of the best films of the last few years. If they didn't, however, then it would be another half baked action film.Unfortunately it was the latter.For all of those who have played the game and liked it for it's sheer dark, sinister, and deeply poetic nature will be sorely disappointed.I find it hard to see where they went wrong. Maxy Payne the VG was more or less a film in itself. If they had followed in Sin City's footsteps then they could have made an amazing game into an amazing film. In this instance following in another films footsteps may not have been such a bad idea.This film paints Max Payne as a somewhat more pathetic character than seen in the game. There is none of the charisma in this film that made Max Payne (the video game) what it was. There are references to the game within the film. A few references, however, are not enough when they miss one of the fundamentals of the game. There is none of the mental torture that Max Payne suffered in the game. As sadistic as it sounds, that was the point of the game. You watched and played a man slowly falling further and further into the darkness of his own mind. The film shows very, very little of this. And what little it does show is just making him, again, look pathetic rather than deeply troubled. The inner monologue is also ditched entirely. Another similarly fundamental aspect.Saying this, the action scenes were quite well done and, despite my moaning, the storyline was not terrible. Some of the acting was pretty poor in places. Towards the end of the film it does start to get better. But the first 5 minutes seemed so amateurish and poorly edited that I almost wanted to stop watching there and then.This may be a little harsh. But then, this is just my opinion. I wanted, and they could have given so much more.",Max Payne
330,chuck_denyer,Payne killer,3,16 November 2008,"First off, those of you 'loyal fans' of the game that voted this movie good ... are you out of your minds!?!this movie has the same huge flaw of the 'doom' movie, the best thing,the vital thing about the doom game was that it was about a portal to hell being opened unleashing monsters, in the movie the chose to have people mutate into monsters.no mention of hell at all? i mean its simple, you take the best things out of the game, and you put them into the movie. as a big fan of the game , i walked out the cinema angry. What were the main things that made max payne a flipping awesome game?1.The film noir/comic style and narrative story telling 2.The gunfights,action game play in or out of bullet time 3.The story line and the eerie world it creates.i thought these elements would have been a given, when making the film. They only had 1 of those, which i do give credit for, the sets and environment were great, the snow,junkies ,everything felt max payne. and yeah the storyline was good enough, they changed it a bit from what i can remember,the game one was better though.and throwing in the hallucinated demons was a good idea(maybe a bit overdone, if it was just one persons hallucinations it would be okay).But the other 2 components aren't even there.which i think is unforgivable. The narration dialogue in the game is awesome.i was honestly hoping they would even use some of it in the movie, word for word.(i remember when i watched sin city ages ago,the way bruce willis narrates for his role,i was like thats exactly like max payne!!)the film noir/narrative style also has the ability to rope you in, so why not use it.Also cmon the first half hour to 45 mins.i think there was probably 8 gun shots, 6 of which were at toilet doors.instead of pushing them open he has to blow them open with a gun you don't even get in the game!? the other 2 are in the flash back where he dispatches 2 of the 3 'baddies' with no problems(yawn)the one bullet time scene - max jumping backward shooting backward!? , was quite well done,effects-wise , except that when it went to the side view, it looked like the bullets the dude upstairs was firing were hitting test tubes about 3 metres to the right of max? the only okay gun fight was with the swat in the aesir building, still it lacked any creativeness!besides that there were maybe 2 or 3 other action scenes. all totally pathetic!, just shows max shooting, then shows bad guys dying. no problem. some of them don't even get a shot off. there was no diving shooting (except at a door!wtf!)no taking cover behind things ,tactics, no Molotov cocktails ,clever ways to get out of situations !!painkillers! for heavens sake man! it's just sad this wasn't half the movie it could have been. i don't get why all movies based on games are shy of making it exactly like the game!!(i mean especially when the game actually has a credible plot,script and so on) people who play the game want to see it like it is in the game, naming a garage after the gogniti brothers and tube stop 'roscoe street station' ,throwing in familiar names here and there aren't good enough.the best thing about the movie was the way the credits and the end were done.just eye candy - shallow ,unimaginative and pointless eye candy. like most of the film. the part where max goes back to his abandoned house? why does he even go there? how does max respond to his wife's death?, he goes to the foot of the bed and just stands there and stares. in position just to show off how it fades from a nice happy time to the current dark time.no point just looks cool.",Max Payne
331,anders-469,What a slap in the face,1,17 November 2008,"Its pretty simple The game Max Payne offers material to one awesome action film like a Mix of the matrix and a Noir style detective movie like Sin city with a hard boiled detective going nuts with mad bullet-time ""slow motion"" bullet dodging AKA the matrix instead the Director/writer decided to rewrite it into something Keanu Reeves would have tried to be cast for instead of Hardcore action scenes with bullet time they change the story and start talking about demon like paranoia visions which is caused by some Army designed drug SAY WHAT ????????This movie could have been the action movie of the century with a Mix of the matrix and Sin City instead it turned out as laughable movie looking more like a Rewrite of the movie Constantine and on top of that the whole cast is lame starring Mark which doesn't look scruffy at all with his baby face. Not that he is a bad actor but he just isn't the right cast Clive Owen or some such would have been a better choice They cast Mila as Mona sax? she still looks like she is 19 come on! I'm not saying she is a bad actor i don't have a valid comment for her but she is not right in this movie the one who played Natasha would have fit the part better Lt. bravura is cast by Ludalol i mean Ludachris of course WHAT AN AWESOME ACTOR IM NOT BEING SARCASTIC HERE!!!... All in all this is a slap in the face i hope someone else makes a movie worthy of the game because there is ""SPOILER"" 1 bullet time scene in the whole movie just one ..... That alone is enough to make me go on IMDb and pound on my keyboard. And for you John Moore why the heck did u say yes to directing this movie if u are going to rewrite it for the worse your are a such a failure with the rewrites u did u went so far off the ""game script"" that u might as well have changed the name of the movie into something like ""KEANU COULD HAVE PLAYED THIS PART"" would fit okay or Constantine 2 or ""Dawn of stupid directors"" This movie should have been made by the same team that made Sin City starring Clive Owen then it would have been the one of the ""coolest"" movies ever made up there with Sin City and The matrix 1its my wish that Rodrigez or Tarantino has played the game and laughed at this movie and take it on to do the whole Theme of the game just because what the heck is up for Burning roofs and demons flying around that is not in the game then why add it in the movie when u have the perfect setting to make a awesome action movie. this is the second hyped up Movie that turned out the be a load of crap just as bad as the new X-files movie P.S the guy that said you were a die hard fan of the game and thought this was a cool movie WHAT THE HECK DUDE ! thats not being a fan if u can say thumps up after they completely destroyed everything Max Payne could have been the bloody ""movie sequences"" in the Game is better written than the movie Everyone involved in this movie failed. With all the rewrites you did it would have taken like 3 more to make a standalone movie which had nothing whatsoever to do with Max Payne instead of Ripping off fans of the game.and Mr Moore go apply for a job at Fox where you would actually be considered talentedSo to end this i would just say the movie doesn't do the game any just so if your a fan don't bother watching it. If don't know the game i guess the movie would appear as a normal suspense thriller with very little action",Max Payne
332,Fiendrunner74,Teaching an old dog new tricks!,7,13 October 2008,"It is a common sight these days, the computer game goes to Hollywood, what is not so common is a plot that does not insult your intelligence. The Max Payne game worked very hard to add a noir style to the First Person Shooter, and this movie brings only those elements to a very good story. Max Payne lays on the visuals pretty thick, but creates a good cinematic vibe. The ""Bullet Time"" concept that was so well toted in the game is used very well, without looking like a game trick, while the comic book characters while not fully detailed are given a realness that is refreshing for the genre. I was at first skeptical about the introduction of supernatural themes to the movie, and was again pleased by the way this was handled by the film. Overall, it will never be a great tale, but it handles an old story with new visuals and interest very well. First and foremost I judge a film on its entertainment value, and this film is very entertaining.",Max Payne

WAY MORE...Man, where to begin...1:The story was boring. It wasn't slow, it was boring! This was probably because it was an action/thriller film with no action or thrills. And on that point...2:There was no action. AT ALL! Where are the huge gunfights? You could count the number of people that got shot on one finger...barely. The explosions? Oh, wait, there was one explosion right at the end for no reason beyond giving them something to put in the trailer. And there was questionably NO BULLET TIME.3:Mark Walberg can not act. See the Happening for further proof.4:Having characters that exist just to tell you that Max Payne is a scary guy isn't as convincing as him actually being scary.5: Having tattoo artist that exist just to tell you that Norse Mythology is scary isn't as convincing at letting the source material flow as part of a well conceived, fatalistic film noir story. That was the point! Its suppose to be Film Noir.6: Its suppose to be Film NOIR! You know...gritty? Subjective? Fatalistic? Atmospheric? Hell...monologuing? Finally: Everything else was terrible. All you had to do was make the game into a film. It was THAT SIMPLE. I MEAN THE GAME IS MADE LIKE A FILM....these people are idiots. Don't see this film. Its a garbled mess of a masterpiece that deserves to be staked through the heart and left to rot in limbo.",Max Payne

The Theaters should pay us to see that movie. Once Ludicrous was introduced i leaped out of my seat and felt the urge to leave the theater and barf all over the max Payne posters hanging up in the hallways. in one scene when max Payne busted into a room and started shooting wildly like a drunk crack addict i could not help but laugh. this movie was stinky pile of poopy and i don't know how much i can stress this.

Just got home from this just now, as a die hard fan i have to unfortunately say i am very disappointed yet filled with a completeness that this character was honored on film. Marky Mark in my opinion was the wrong choice, his attitude and tone lacked the black humor of the games, i couldn't hold back this thought for at least the first 20 minutes that casting should have gone to the writer Sam Lake and spent half the budget training him to act, hell give the main role to Chris O'Donnell to resurrect his flat lining career. Chris Bridges was strong in the support role and Nicole Horne's casting was spot on. Special Effects were pretty cool, even though the game was one of the first to do the bullet time thing, in this day and age the Matrix made sure all films to follow with slow mo will be 2nd class, so no new ground was really broken.The movie did pick up in the last half, but it was a little like flogging a dead horse ... i had already seen 1 person leave the cinema and everyone mirrored my own overbearing sense B grade-itis as the scenes kept rolling. I'll save the last gripe to last and its the most important ...NO ORIGINAL THEME SONG ????? i was hoping they would revamp this with some Hollywood class but it was no where to be seen, for me it was what made the game and captured every inch of Max's struggle into the night, huge let down.",Max Payne

I don't understand why Mark Wahlberg signed up for this, with 'THE HAPPENING' which i thought was just a waste of time. This film really made me think on what were they thinking when they writing the script and the ACTUAL MOVIE. Performances from the cast were not great, this movie could have been better 'IF' the story could have been portrayed differently. The movie does not live up to the excitement and charisma like the game. Hopefully Mark Wahlberg will do better in the next few movies he will be doing, i cannot wait for 'The Brazilian Job' which i wish is as good as the first in the franchise. In conclusion, most will say this, do not waste your money to see this. Its just going to be a waste of time.

I was so disappointed that I actually signed to IMDb to tell all you guys , how bad I feel about this movie..Mr Moore just killed our game. He should leave it to somebody else. There were few nice moments thought. I can't tell..the moment when he took the drag and some parts what he saw after taking it..that was nice and I give credits for that..Those human angels taking those bad guys..nice...but missing the key the core, the main main thing SLOW MOTION...and I need to ask...did they play the game and didn't find the button for slow motion ?

339,Silver_Fire-715-180021,"I'm so disappointed, it's sad",2,12 May 2010,"Max Payne the game, both 1 and 2, were probably two of the most creative, deep, emotional and original games that I've ever laid eyes on. In my opinion, it's downright near impossible not to get into the story - a game you want to play again and again just to pick up every little hidden message that you missed the first time. Simply, it was astounding. Which is why I was so excited to hear they were going to make a movie out of it. Surprise, surprise...I can't help but complain about everything. Max Payne, the story built literally for every occasion - a book, a game, a comic, a movie - was so hugely cropped and twisted around that, even with the same names and a partial sketch of the main storyline, was hardly recognizable. But really, without Sam Lake, what is Max Payne to begin with? It's all because of Sam that Max Payne fought his way past all the generic mysteries, crime dramas, dark comedies and romances in the first place and spliced everything together so well that you can't even tell you're playing a game you bought from the sale's rack anymore. But because of this movie, it's sunken right back down into the pool of generic mysteries, crime dramas and etc. Such a shame...Another thing was the cast. Max's actual character was played with too much...optimism? Of course that's not saying much. Max is the definition of dead-pan neutralness. And that's not even a word. So anything less than no personally shows through. Mona Sax was even worse. Now, don't get me wrong. I love Mila Kunis. But she and Mona Sax mix in no way. I was so expecting the sassy, deep-voiced and ruthless female killer to make her appearance, but unfortunately, Mila just doesn't fit that category. Sorry, Mila. Otherwise, the Valkyrie hallucinations were a little out of place and the Ragnarok nightclub could have been A LOT darker, denser and creepy. That going along with Max's detachment towards his dead family, which supposedly is his whole reason for going nuts in the first place and some other major problems with the story. So I'll say it again: Without Sam Lake's brilliant and emotional dialog and storyline, Max Payne really is just another generic mystery/crime drama. Bring him into the picture and then see my REALLY impressed face.2/10 Such a crime...Or at least, had the opportunity to be.",Max Payne
340,chris_walkenbach,Video game movies all suck to a point.,7,22 October 2008,"I have not seen this film; but I have seen the FAQ page and it hurts to think that most if not all of the time, probably because of copyright issues, they cant make a film that is like the original video game. Look at Resident Evil, good movie, for those who never played the video games. I could not help but critique that film for the strange job that it did in melding the first 3 games into one. Yet George Romero had a script that followed the game pretty well. Now on to Max Payne, oh the principal actor, while he probably did will in the film, DID NOT PLAY THE GAME. Maybe he didn't have time, most likely, but if he did, he should have played the game. Then he could probably have made a better film. These people who make movies are, for the most part, not hardcore gamers. If Hollywood is going to make a film based on a video game, get people who play that certain type of video game and hopefully have experience in Hollywood to make the movie.

This p#ssed me off so much I still haven't got over it this day, and I seen this movie on the release date. Lets kill off the hottest char Olga Kurylenko right away instead of making her Mona Sax. Lets hire Mark Walberg who never even PLAYED the game to be Max Payne. Director says DERP DERP, he can wing it! Okay now lets film 10 minutes of action with lots of boring cut scenes where lots of boring s#1t happens. If it even was ten minutes of action. Max only face one crime boss and he is a p$$$y. I could go on and on, but I felt like this was long overdue. Movie companies shouldn't desecrate the greatest games of all time. It really sucks they destroyed this movie.

But as I see this movie gets a lot of bashing that it (according to me) does not deserve. I feel I have to leave my opinion too.I went to the cinema with kind of low expectations. This IS a video game adaptation after all. I was positively surprised.The video game version of Max wasn't a particularly ""deep"" character. At best a melodramatic hook to explain the hunt for revenge and some cool smack-talk in the cut-scenes. But that worked in a video game. In fact you didn't want more story than that in a FPS game. This movie even though not 100% true to the story from the game (which in my opinion is a good thing) delivered a story that felt realistic because it had more details. In the game you never needed/wanted to see Max do everyday things, any investigation or paperwork. It's those small things that makes for realismYou can see when an actor really likes the role he/she is playing. Mark Wahlberg really shines in his character interpretation of Max Payne. He makes Max seem like a real person, not a video game character.I would say that Mr. Wahlberg is to this movie, what Johnny Depp was to Pirates of the Caribbiean. He lifts the movie with his quiet, yet destiny burden version of Max Payne.",Max Payne
343,nflandersfarmer,Words can't express how terrible this is.,1,1 October 2012,"This movie was the first piece of Max Payne material I viewed, before the games and mini- comics, and it makes me sad that I hadn't played it first. This movie is riddled with flaws that remove the Max Payne series of its prestige and overall amazingness. The first game, which this film is based on so loosely that its hard to find any resemblance, was a groundbreaking video game with a deep and engulfing story line along with exciting action and witty humour (not to mention all those great metaphors). The other two games were just as brilliant, with each one improving the franchise just that little bit. Through the whole series you get a very clear image of who Max Payne is: a relentless ex-cop trying to get over his demons and leave his past by consuming massive amounts of alcohol and pain killers. He looks at the world in a cynical way, expressing his feelings about where he is or his current situation through well-constructed metaphors which intrigue the player. But Fox studios decided to throw all that away and create the most generic action heroes ever conceived, played by a mediocre actor. Mark Wahlberg can't even lift a candle to the complex character of Max Payne, and I can't see any reason why he was even considered for the role. I'm not sure what the casting department was on, but who in hell would chose Ludicrous; an African American rapper, to play Jim Bravura; a fat old white NYPD chief. That is just sheer stupidity. And Mila Kunis as Mona Sax? Jesus... all I can say is that there are many other actresses out there who would actually suit the role, and who would actually be able to play.The entire script has been rewritten with the bare minimum of the original story still in tact which would make any Max Payne fan die inside. An amazing tale of loss and revenge is replaced by a cheap flick about violent rampages and senseless shootouts. I don't know what Fox was thinking, but they should have just left this legend of a video game alone.A god-awful movie that no fan of the games should ever view. EVER.",Max Payne
344,SanAndrez,A Bit Closer To Hell,5,16 November 2008,"To make any kind of sense of it, I need to go back seven years - back to the night the Pain started... 2001. I had absolutely no idea what I was installing on my slow and old computer back than. Only the knowledge that the game was from 3DRealms and Remedy. After a couple of minutes of low frame rate and sordid texture detail my life was changed forever, for good or ill. It was a king-hell bastard of an experience. There is no other game in the world that had such a massive impression and love from first shot. Yeah, you get it. We all know that Hollywood has a special policy about converting famous games into high-budget flicks. ""Use the original name, change everything else."" This sums it up. The wrong turn about the Max Payne movie is that it is a full-scale profit orientated. If it was filmed as a tribute (1:1) in mind, things would have been very different. The script is ""skillfully"" altered to something very vague and misleading that the only people who will like it, are those with no knowledge about the game. There is no Vladimir Lem, no Alfred Wooden, no Frankie ""The Bat"" Niagara, no Vinnie Cognitti, the valkyr is blue, there is no dark humor and Max Payne is a sissy stoned on V with totally no clear idea in mind. B.B. is a very sensitive and nice guy, Nicole Horn is just an old hag in a limousine with no army of killer suits behind her, the motto of Aesir is changed to something else, there is no Punchinello, wait?

345,Michael_0036,Very good for a film based on a computer game...,7,17 October 2008,"...which is intended to be qualified praise. Having played both 'Max Payne' games, I really enjoyed the small touches in the film that are intentionally added to please the 'fanboys' like myself, such as bullet time (albeit too brief)and the flashings of red whilst Max is attacked (the same that occurs when Max incurs damage during the game). I also really enjoyed (and I will avoid spoilers) how the script managed to inject some realism into how Max could realistically shoot down (and sustain damage) towards the end when the climax erupts in a shower of bullets.Also great perfs generally all round - Mark Wahlberg is surprisingly good, Mr Bridges and Ludicrous are adequate, and although she has nothing to do but basically be hot, the upcoming Bond girl is smouldering. The director also adds some nice touches in parts, particularly some of the action scenes which are very well shot/choreographed.Fan boy ravings aside, the film critic in me had concerns with a number of filming techniques. Firstly, the pacing. The pacing is all over the place, with the first hour often dragging in parts. I also had the concern that people without an awareness of the 'Max Payne' mythology may wonder what the heck is going on. Secondly, given the emphasis on plot in the first hour, the movie is inadequate in explaining back story for some minor characters. Yes, we get the point Max lost his family. We see this in flash back at least three times, each time not adding anything further to the plot. This time could have been spent fleshing out the characters - people whom i saw it with today (not ever having played the game) were wondering (apart from the sister connection) why Mona Sax was such a vicious woman who had a knack for wielding sub-machine games, or how BB came on to the scene. Third, it is disappointing that the cuts to permit it to be a PG 13 are obvious. Here in Australia it is MA (meaning no admission below 15) and deals with some very dark themes, so it is disappointing that the MPAA had to be humoured to get a PG, when really, it is an MA film (or R17 in the US).Overall, an enjoyable film, particularly for most fanboys. Having said that, fanboys will probably agree there is not enough 'action' for an 'action' film, whilst film critics will no doubt criticise the shallow character development.",Max Payne

The acting was poor, which although could be expected since Marky Mark was cast in the lead role and his performance's always lack of skill. However I am stunned how this screenplay was approved by the studio. I haven't played the game but I'm guessing ALL the lines came directly from it, no exception. Watching this movie was like watching a computer game. And who in hell wants to WATCH a computer game when you can PLAY it yourself? I don't recommend this movie to anyone, not even if you have the ability to live for eternity. I bet 100 minute of starring into a brick wall will give you more satisfaction.",Max Payne
347,edgecrusher02,Was this really supposed to be Max Payne?,1,4 February 2009,"First let me start by saying I am a big fan of the game and I still remember it to this day. With that said, this movie was maybe 25% like the game, I'm probably being generous here. The first hour was a boring predictable detective movie. The character in this movie was not Max Payne in any way except by name. More than half the characters were left out and on top of that the only story they used was the fact that his family was killed and it had something to do with the drug Valkyr. Instead of Max being a cop with ""nothing to lose"" and on the run like the original story suggests, he is merely a suspect in his partners murder therefore getting rid of the suspense of the whole cop on the run thing. They left out how it was narrated which was pretty much the way this noir story should have been told. Also the cryptic theme song that set the tone of the game was discarded like it meant nothing. They used what one crazy guy in the game claimed he saw while on valkyr as the base for the whole movie, there were no demons/angels or whatever they were in the original story, they felt VERY out of place. Basically they replaced story and substance with cool special effects and a big name actor, obviously in this case not a good trade. You barely get a chance to know Max before it abruptly ends in an unsatisfying way. Mark Wahlberg admitted to not playing the game therefore he had no idea how the character he was playing was supposed to be, way to research the role Marky Mark. On top of getting a mediocre director who obviously had no idea what source material he was really dealing with, this movie was doomed from the start. I really hope this franchise goes the way of the last 2 hulk movies, a terrible one gets made and then someone steps up and makes it the way its supposed to be. So who's going to step up and save Max Payne? If you like and remember the game, DO NOT see this movie, you might be better off watching Bloodrayne again.",Max Payne
348,Lavarpsu10,Max Payne doesn't believe in angels.,6,21 October 2008,"A resounding ""meh"" for this one. There were lots of good points about the movie, which I see as sort of a reverse Hit-man. Hit-man (the movie) was changed from having the sneaky stealth action of the game series to being a mindless shoot-em-up action movie. Max Payne on the other hand, went from a mindless shoot-em-up game to a more of a mystery movie.The change makes sense and I didn't begrudge it. It's much less fun to watch endless scenes of bullet-time shooting when you're not the one controlling it. In addition, changing Max from an undercover DEA agent to a cold case worker makes sense for the mystery aspect. He could hardly have investigated his wife's unsolved murder as a would-be Mafia hood. The problem is, mysteries are story-driven, and when half your target audience knows the entire story already, the tension is mostly gone. The characters fall a bit flat too. None of the actors are really compelling in their roles. Wahlberg is decent enough in that he looks and sounds sort of like Max Payne, but his ""happy"" ""worried"" and ""sad"" faces are obvious caricatures. Thankfully he spends most of the movie in the much better ""brooding"" face.The action, when it happens, is decent. It's a bit more realistic than the game, except for the annoying fact that (like in all action movies) the hero has handguns that can shoot 150 bullets before reloading. In any case, I was disappointed they didn't make Max a V-head from earlier in the movie. It was a perfect opportunity to explain away bullet time, that Max was one of the 1% that turned superhuman on Valkyr. Unfortunately, he doesn't take V until after several bullet time sequences. Opportunity wasted!The biggest problem is that Max Payne is basically a modern mystery/action movie. Part of what made the game classic was it's sarcastic sense of humor and graphic novel storytelling, mixed with it's John-Woo-meets-Humphrey-Bogart cinematic style. Most of this is gone in the movie. Max's inner monologue, which provides much of the biting wit and noir atmosphere the game is known for, is almost totally gone. Much of the colorful comic book- style settings are gone too, replaced by ubiquitous industrial parks and run-down apartment buildings. Most groan inducing of all, Max ends the movie with a feeling of contentment and satisfaction of having avenged his family, rather than being a grounded-in-reality, depressed and tough-as-nails cop who knows he has simply tied up some loose ends. This is not the Max we know and love, the one who knows that the dead don't care about vengeance.In storytelling, in the action sequences and in the characters, Max Payne mostly has it right. But the most important piece of the puzzle, the atmosphere, is missing and it will leave fans of the series unsatisfied.",Max Payne
349,siminof,5 Reasons of Dissapointement.,5,18 November 2008,"I guess that when a movie is taken from a comic book, a novel, or even a video game, it must respect the essence of it's source. In the ""Max Payne"" game there was some important standards that were ignored during the movie production:1-The narration: Mark Whalberg's cold voice as a narrator at the beginning of each chapter would be great (note that the first scene of the movie when Max said: ""I don't believe in Heaven. I believe in Pain. I believe in Fear. I believe in Death."" is what I'm talking about) 2-Bullet time action scenes: I think that this was the most influential part of the game, but it was abstracted to only one scene in the movie when Max shot the security while jumping backward.3-Mona Sax should be the ""Dark Sexy Angel"" of the movie: the choice of Mila Kunis for this role was not perfect because she's so sweet for this role. I guess that Olga Kurylenko would be perfect as Mona Sax.4-Painkillers or Drugs: they make people see ""ANGELS""!!! when Max took the drug, instead of letting him see monsters, they must let him sort of slow time which would be wonderful and much more closer to the game.5-The Guns: The big ""Desert Eagle"" gun is Mona's gun...not some little machine gun.In the end I was really disappointed from this movie...",Max Payne
350,mcdinealds,"Great video game to movie so far, but somewhat confusing.",10,17 October 2008,"Max Payne is overall, a visually stunning and good action film, but probably due to some cuts (thanks fox) is somewhat confusing. Especially if you haven't played the games.The movie starts off pretty well, then dulls down and then gets exciting again. This happens many times in the movie,some bits had your heart racing and you where left in suspense, others you felt a bit bored... There was also feeling that the editing makes the viewer feel that there are missing scenes, i.e. there's not much back story or emotion to some of the supporting characters. This is where Max Payne was confusing, especially to people that haven't played the games. Some of the characters names are barely mentioned or not mentioned at all until the last moment, this makes it somewhat confusing.Other than the noticeable editing and some plot/character confusion, the film will not disappoint in the film-noir/drugs/action department. Tonnes of Drugs, Violence and Adult themes which make the movie and its gritty-noir style unique to other films. The Valkyr Drug scenes are downright scary and powerfully visceral showing the effects of drugs and that John Moore can direct, the bullet-time is very great and is not a rip-off, but there was a lack of it! (ONE OF THE MOST NASTIEST,GRITTY PG-13 MOVIES EVER!)The setting is another great visual element to the film, the harsh cold snow and rain, along with the drity urban feel of NYC is great. This film is a great homage to film-noir much like the games where.Getting down to the rest of the films review, the acting. Mark Wahlberg in most scenes shines, especially in the scenes about his dead wife and child, but the constant angry grimace on his face does get funny in some bits. Mila Kunis acts well, but her character needs more explanation and background. Beau Bridges acts quite well, and so does Ludicrous, who actually plays a great character but doesn't get enough screen time sadly......But the one who shines the most, is Amaury Nolasco as Jack Lupino! his character is terrifying, creepy and somewhat likable as a villain.To sum it all up, Max Payne has visceral content which looks and amazes you, there are a lot of scenes which surprisingly, haven't been done in any other film and not as well as Max Payne does it!, oh and especially the audio in this movie, Max Payne's sound effects are purely awesome and they sound authentic, deep and meaty! The adaptation from game to film is very good, but the major let down is the rough editing, confusion and character development. This could all be cleaned up in an uncut DVD. Overall a movie which would please fans of the game, action/drug related movie genre fans. This movie is somewhat like 300, it has strong visual power and story, but lacks some development and back-story, along with the confusion, thanks to the editing. The uncut DVD version would raise my score to 8.5/10 especially if they include more scenes which have more character development and back-story. Max Payne is well worth your movie admission ticket, but I'm sure the uncut DVD would be even better.review by Rama Dolman, Perth. Aust.FINAL SCORE 7/10",Max Payne
351,brandon-247,"It's supposed to be a movie, not a video game.",4,26 October 2008,"If your going to make a movie based off a game, then make sure you remember that your making a movie and not a video game. In a game or a book, you are following your characters for long periods of time. In a movie you only have an hour and a half to tell a story. So I don't expect everything from the game to be in the movie, but make sure what you put in the movie is done well.I've seen from other posts that gamers like it because it's true to the game. I think the movie was choppy, and the characters were doing things that were not motivated. The movie reminded me of the scripts I would read in film school because every 5 minutes there had to be a flashback to pump more information into the movie so that you would understand why someone was doing something.Honestly, I think it would have been more interesting to watch if the movie started where this one ended. If I wanted to watch a movie with this story line, I could have stayed home and watched the 80's punisher. At least then I could have laughed and Dolph Lundren sitting in a sewer chanting ""Punish""",Max Payne
352,CyKill,"Oh Marky Mark, I still like you",3,19 October 2008,"Let me start by saying this...I love Mark Wahlberg. As a matter of fact he's one of my favorite actors right now. I really enjoy the majority of his movies.But Max Payne just didn't do it for me. Which almost pains me to say, but it was just such a big disappointment. I assumed from the trailers it would be quite entertaining, but it was not. It was really quite boring, nothing like the video game, and was not at all what i expected. There was hardly any good action scenes. And the movie as a whole took very long to develop. While watching this movie, you'll question the significance of some of the characters, and wonder why you came to see this.During the flick I could not figure out what was going on, who was who, and what the hell they were talking about. I won't say don't go see this movie if you want to...But if you do you'll want your money back.Overall I'll give this movie 1.5 stars out of 5. Sorry Marky Mark, but say hello to your mother for me.",Max Payne
353,steven_burke,Play the game first.....,10,20 September 2019,"Don't take this film out of context and review it without playing the game, the game came first and the film second. As a Noir game and film it is an excellent homage to the game on so many levels but take seperatly as a film I can understand why it's not so widley recieved or understood. Each to there own but as you can probably tell I really liked this film and will be revisiting the game and its unique (at the time) bullet time sequences (pre Matrix) - check that out as well......Enjoy",Max Payne
354,konerkid34,A Dark and Powerful Adaptation,8,10 September 2010,"I have been playing the Max Payne video games since they first came out in 2001. As the movie was announced I was hyped. Mark Wahlberg being Detective Max Payne and Mila Kunis as Mona Sax. Coincidentally when I first started playing the games, when Mona was portrayed in the comic books in the game, I realized that Kunis looks a lot like Sax in the game. So first of all, great casting choice. But as the movie was released, all of these poor reviews came pouring out, much to my dismay. I started to read through all these poorly written reviews, and realized that many of these people have not the slightest clue what they are talking about. Many made it very evident that they had never played the video games, which is necessary to understand vital aspects of the success of the adaptation.The basic plot of the movie is that Max Payne, a detective in the NYPD, returns home one day to find his wife and baby daughter murdered at the hands of drug addicts, high on a designer drug called Valkyr. After years of working on the case, Max and his ex- partner Alex are determined to solve the murders of Max's wife and baby. When Alex discovers a massive cover-up, things go wrong: Alex is suddenly killed, and Max is framed for his murder. Hunted by the cops and driven by determination to avenge his family, Max Payne sets out to uncover the truths behind his family's murder.First I want to say that I was blown away by how cutting down various aspects of the game, and tying them up into one sequential storyline allowed the movie to pace faster than the game itself. By introducing Payne to Bravura (Ludacris) early on in the film, in addition to Colvin (O'Donnell) the film can progress faster instead of cutting in and out of the story by going on side missions for the Russian mob, like Payne does in the video game. By eliminating the aspect of a gang war, and focusing completely on Payne's search for vengeance. The director (John Moore) did a wonderful job of symmetry and color augmentation to emphasize specific points of interest in the movie along with Jonathon Sela, who used sublime cinematography to really grab the audience and connects various scenes back to the video games, bringing forward iconic comic book shots. I also would like to applaud Sela on using bullet-time properly, not only that he used it, but he didn't abuse it which I first thought would happen before going to see the movie.I could honestly go on forever, as to the reasons to see this movie or reasons to buy the game that started this movie. By using a ""Punisher-like"" action, even moving like Max Payne in the games, I was really drawn into this movie even until the end credits, which were amazing as well. I really enjoyed this movie, and will for sure go back to see it many times. But you should have some knowledge of the video games that the movie is based off of to understand the immense power that this movie can deliver.",Max Payne
355,tmapub,Good movie,9,14 January 2009,"I was a little bit skeptical about watching the movie due to the bad reviews on IMDb, but I haven't been disappointed at all! I have played the game Max Payne and I would say that the movie is very close to the spirit of the game. When I watched it, I had the impression to be replaying the game on my PC (and it was more than 6 years ago). The story, the atmosphere and the personages in the movie really fit to the first Max Payne's PC game. MP is for me a good action movie and found it personally more enjoyable, than for example, shoot'em up (which gets a better score than MP). Some readers gave 2/10 for no reasons... so I give it a 10 in order to balance.",Max Payne
356,Professor12,Brilliant adaption! Stays true to the game.,9,9 June 2009,"Let me start by saying that I am a die-hard Max Payne fan; I still remember playing the game for the first time and was absolutely hooked on the story. Now after watching the movie I seriously thought that it was fantastic and an excellent translation from the game, they managed to keep important elements from the game and turn them into original ideas for the big screen, which I think was really well planned and thought out. Okay, so they left out certain things/Characters from the game (Vinnie, Vlad, Woden, ""The Inner Circle"", the Mob) but if a sequel is ever made (which I'm hoping for) then all the important things that were missed will be included in the next film; all loose ends will be tied! Now for the acting...I thought Mark Wahlberg did a really good job in portraying Max; his facial expressions really reminded me of the character from the game. I thought that the hard, kind of sad look suited him. Great acting as well.Mila Kunis as Mona. I think she did a pretty good job although she wasn't in much of the movie which was rather disappointing but still a job well done.Chris Bridges as Jim Bravura. Now initially I thought 'oh no, what have they done?' They probably could have chosen someone else but in all honesty, I didn't see any problem with him playing the role.Some of the other Actors, BB, Lupino, Alex, really well portrayed. I also thought that the addition of Jason Colvin (Chris O'Donnell) was quite clever and it gave Max an avenue to find out more of the death of his wife and Family. The Valkyr Junkies were also well depicted, they way they mumble things to themselves to the way they look; pretty impressive.The one thing however, which I think they totally nailed was the overall scenery/visuals of the film. This is probably the number one thing that I wanted the movie to have and they executed it perfectly! The way the snow fell to the old rigid alleyways and apartment blocks from the visuals of Noir New York; just perfect! Probably the closest video game adaption in terms of visuals and scenery that you'll find. (Although there are some minor tweaks to the story, but they still manage to keep it close to the game) Now, the reason I gave this a 9/10 is because It just seemed to me that there was very little flow, kind of felt like it was just cut and paste. The editing from scene to scene is fine but some parts could have been done a lot better.Overall, this is a great film. The action scenes especially were done brilliantly. I really can't wait for them to make a sequel. My only guess is that they'll combine some of the important things missed in the first movie with the story of the second game so it should be pretty good, can't wait!",Max Payne
357,system7878,Disappointing,5,25 October 2008,"I just saw Max Payne and I'm very conflicted. While my friends and I unanimously agreed that it was one of the most terribly scripted movies we have seen, some part of me still wants to give this movie a score much higher than it truly deserves. I felt to justify this feeling one must look at all the aspects of this movie.The acting was mediocre at best, and most characters seemed to have no place in the storyline. The plot is badly written, leaving the theater it felt more like I've just seen Constantine 2 than Max Payne, even though the writers tried to remain faithful to the storyline of the video game. The soundtrack was boring, the only highlight was hearing Manson on the trailer for this film. Even the actions scenes sucked, for it seems that no character but Max is capable of aiming a firearm.The thing that saves this movie is the beautiful scenes. Several moments in this film is so visual stunning, I couldn't help but smile and forget about all the things that was wrong with Max Payne.If you want to see a typical action movie, you might enjoy this one. If you want to see a homage to the game we all loved, lower your expectations 'cause this one is going to disappoint.",Max Payne
358,Doggejern,Wrong... so wrong.,2,28 January 2009,"It was not with much hope that I watched Max Payne. Knowing how VG-based movies usually turn out, I was prepared for the worst... and yet, I was mortified.Let me summarize this quickly: Nearly everything that could have been wrong with this film was wrong. If you are going to watch this film with the mindset of seeing a gritty film noir styled action/thriller, (read: What it should have been) then prepare to be disappointed, as you are treated to a cheap knock-off of Constantine, with some really stilted symbolism about evil angels and valkyries. Whoop-de-doo...For those familiar with the game, the plot, the characters and events will all seem completely alien and painfully stripped of their original personalities. (Jim Bravura played by Ludicrous? Oh God.) The only character who really feels right is Jack Lupino, and the idea of him being one of the test subjects for the Valkyr drug was actually an interesting concept. Nice to see that at least something was done right. Those not familiar with the game will probably wish they were, so as to understand everything about the plot. No worries there, though, you could find more similarities to a tibetan yak than to the Max Payne game franchise in this film. It might be that I as a gamer felt personally offended by this sickening butchery of one of the gaming world's most awesome characters, and had it not been called Max Payne I probably would not have hated it with the passion that i do. Still, as a film, it is not a very good one, and I do not recommend it. If only they would have let John Woo direct it. Then it might have been worth watching. As it is now, this film was nothing more than a complete waste of one hour and forty minutes of my life. And that is wrong. So wrong.",Max Payne

Some Pictures are just typically Max Payne-style... But if you don't know anything about it and you're just lookin for some action movie, you won't like it. It doesn't live from it's action, in fact there's just a little bit of ""real"" action in it, its more the storyline (which can be confusing) and the pictures, which kinda remember of a film noir... The director really tried to bring the strange feeling that you have playing the game on the screen, but he wasn't able to do it 100%So, if you liked the game, go ahead, there's nothing wrong about it... But if you're lookin for some stupid action without anything behind it, you really won't like it!! greez",Max Payne
360,ck_ruse,Poor script ruins Max Payne,5,27 November 2008,"Being a fan of the games, i couldn't help, but feel a bit disappointed when the light came on in the theater and the credits started rolling. I always thought that if a movie based on a computer game was ever gonna be worth watching, Max Payne would be the title that could make it work.Sadly a lot of the cool things that made the games so great has been lost. They've chosen to completely scrap the first person narration, which was a trademark of the games. This results in a Max Payne that generally seems a lot more shallow than the Max Payne from the games. The impression of a cop hanging on to a limb, is replaced by a badass cop that might as well have been played by the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damn or Dolph Lundgren.The story is quite simular to that of the first game, which meant that I never really managed to get excited about the story since i'd played the games, and therefor found it predictable.That being said, the imagery is stunning. The movie takes place in the middle of a snow storm, so the colours are kept cold, but with red providing a contrast. This works very well and helps the movie capture the cool atmosphere from the games.In conclusion, I feel the script is lacking, the characters are lacking, but if you're a fan of the games it's definitely worth a watch, if nothing else, then for the atmosphere. 5/10 from me.",Max Payne

The movie would have been just a bunch of retarded puns and lame insults with nothing but bullets flying every where from scene to scene. The characters would have been extremely deluded because of it. I had all ready imagined that if they were going to do Max Payne as a film they would need to capture the ambiance, the mystery, and the morbidity of the game instead of all of action sequences, while saving just a few magazines for an aggressive conflict. I'm also glad to see that you gave the film an eight/ten, which is relieving because all of the other video game to film adaptations, save Mortal Kombat (The first one, in my opinion), put shame to their respective franchises, including Doom. Your opinion has given me high hopes and I can't wait to see it.P.S. Do you think they should make a Soul Reaver film?",Max Payne
363,deadondelivery,Review with suggestions for Max Payne 2,7,24 October 2008,"I get the feeling there will be a Max Payne 2 movie so I want to make some comments on this one that hopefully, could be useful to a second one. (I'm a BIG fan of the Max Payne 2 game, which is why I'm actually bothering to write my first movie review. Hopefully someone making the movie will read this)The good.1. The movie exceeded my expectations by far. I walked in with lowered expectations, ready for even a Uwe Boll type disaster. This was actually a pretty well done neo-noir movie, above average.2. The atmosphere was fantastic. The gloomy, depressing noir feel of the game, the snow, the lighting - brilliant.3. Mark Wahlberg was very good as Max Payne. As a fan, I was pleasantly surprised. It's unrealistic to expect anything better.4. Mila Kunis was pretty alright, if a bit short, as Mona Sax. If her voice was a bit deeper, she would have been really OK. And the way she got into the elevator while shooting, very like the game, very cool.5. Very close to the MP1 game story line and a lot of nods to fans.The bad1. Mona Sax is the epitome of the femme-fatale (At least in my books). She's elegant and composed. Whoever was doing Mila's makeup made her look a bit like a hooker. Ease up on the black lipstick, she needs to have this french chic, not a goth hooker look. The dresses weren't too bad, just the makeup.2. Max's monologue was missing. The clichéd detective novel statements in the game added to its humour and overall feel. That was missing altogether.3. The first hour seemed interminable due to the lack of action sequences. It would have been better had more been interspersed like in say ""Equilibrium"".The ugly1. I make this comment with hesitation, because I suspect it's something wrong with the theatre I watched it in (Edit: It wasn't, there really is no signature music!). In any case, I'll just mention that there was no signature music. I was waiting for the signature music to start the whole movie!! Did a track get disabled or something? The whole experience in MP is partly because of the sad, melancholy music. There were some nods to the game (i.e. the heartbeat sounds) but overall, the lack of music made the attempts at recreating character emotions fall flat. I hope it was only a problem at that particular theatre and not a general problem. In any case, I heard a track by Marilyn Manson in the trailer, which was pretty cool. But hope there'll be more moody, melancholy music in the next movie. Whoever did the Max Payne in-game music did it right, so why not get them to do it?OverallI'm surprised at how close this movie came to being worthy of the game, but fell short due to some obvious reasons, mainly lack of humorous monologue, a dearth of action sequences and a lack of music.Still, I now have my hopes up for a really good Max Payne 2 movie. The MP2 game was way better than MP1 as a game with more depth to the characters, so the movie will have more material to work with too. Please get Mona Sax and Max and Mona's relationship right somehow!",Max Payne

After 90 minutes I came out smiling and happy, happy that I enjoyed this film. The acting is good and the action scenes are even better, the only downside is the lack of bullet time like in the games but I decided to let that one go. Mark Wahlberg has proved himself yet again that he is up there with the best and I think he will stay up there for years to come. The story in the film was good and original, don't worry I won't spoil it for those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing it yet.

But has anyone thought... Where are the painkillers? Imagine how cool a movie this could have been if just like the games Max traveled from place to place, shootout after shootout, small clue after small clue, and got injured somewhere on par with the original Die Hard and the only way he could keep going is by yup you guessed it taking those pills? This would allow for the trippy dream segments to ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE!!! This was a difficult movie to watch because the games are on my top 5 of all time JUST BASED ON STORY ALONE!! I could not put either down years ago because I WANTED to see what happened to this guy. I mean seriously folks the guys name is a play on Pain(killers) and not one was taken? I blame the writer. Did he even play the game? Or read the cut scenes? No I think he skimmed the back of the box maybe and that's about it.

Its sad that so many people will bad mouth about this movie all because it didn't follow the video game. If you want the movie to be exactly like the game, then what is the point in even making the movie when you can just play the game? Im pretty much just saying shut up about the video game comparison because its not even an important factor in the matter. This movie was solid and it had much more meaning to it than the video game.

368,martyt76,"Not great, but watchable....",5,20 November 2008,"I had the usual high expectations going into this movie, as I normally do with any new Wahlberg movie. Having high expectations for a movie can never be good, can it? Not knowing much about the video game or the plot of the movie helped, as I was going in blind, and that's almost always a good thing for me.I was pretty excited to see Mila Kunis, too. Ever since ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" I've been kind of jonesing for her. I'm not quite sure she fit the character, but she did a passable job as the movie lacked the seriousness it needed anyway.I can't say that Wahlberg did a bad job either, he was his typical self. He's been more of an icon than an actor as of late, and his presence alone in an action movie is enough to make the movie worthwhile.The plot was loose, maybe a little jumbled, and most of the supporting actors were bad. The story tried to sneak up on you with a twist here and there, but mostly it was pretty predictable, with the average ""guy lost everything now seeks revenge"" theme. Which I like. Kind of reminded me of ""The Punisher"".There were minor roles by Beau Bridges, Ludicrous, and Chris O'Donnell that were decent at best. You can't really blame the actors for under-performing in a movie that doesn't quite draw emotion from the actors, and has almost zero character development for everyone except Wahlberg.You probably think I didn't like the flick with the way I've been ranting and complaining, but you're wrong. It was decent. Don't see it in the theater though. It's a good lazy action film to sit at home and zone and watch, as you don't really need to pay real close attention, you can just sit back and enjoy the ride with this one.",Max Payne

Early half, which should have been Max Payne's character development, was finished off in one scene and repeated for most half of the movie.

But wow, the last thing this film entitles is fun. Let's face it, every video game that has been turned into a film has been less than acceptable (All you Resident Evil fanatics know it), but when I saw the trailer for this one, I was ready to call it ""the greatest video game movie"" (even though that doesn't say much at all). I dunno, maybe it was the awesome Marilyn Manson song, but boy did I lose my head thinking that this one was going to be something special. I know I shouldn't judge something just because John Moore's ""greatest"" work has been some of the worst movies I've ever seen(The Omen remake, hahahaha), so I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Boy was I wrong. Aside from the direction, terrible casting (Mila Kunis...really?), lack of plot (no really, I'm not joking. There really isn't one), and too much focus on special effects where they're not needed leaves this hopeful one absolutely lifeless. To sum it all up, it's just lazy film-making. But hey, we're the ones paying to see this garbage. The fact that they have our money means they've already won. There's no NEED to be creative. Just ask John Moore.

Good work Jonathan Sela! You made this worth watching. During the first ¾ the muted colors and institutional look of the police station caused me to reminisce of a certain big company I used to work for, yeah those were the daysnot really, only about 10% are worth remembering as opposed to the cinematography in this film which is very worth remembering. Unfortunately this film sets itself up for a sequel, if one comes out we can only hope that the story flow is better and the cinematography is just as good.",Max Payne
372,C-MoNEYyy,"Played the game or not, Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY",5,18 October 2008,"This movie disappoints on so many levels, John Moore captures the darkness of the game and that is about it. The movie didn't use any of the great elements of the game, hardly any bullet time, the Russian Mob, etc. Story moved pretty slow, and overall was pretty unimpressive.Marky Mark had no room to act, and they just threw pieces together, it was overall a pretty slow and uneventful movie. It's screaming sequel. Which I certainly will not be seeing, if they want to adapt a video game to movie they should at least stay somewhat true to the game. Even if you haven't played the game, the storyline is mostly of him feeling sorry for himself then rushing to kill people in the last 15 minutes. Save yourself the 10+ dollars and netflix it in a few months.",Max Payne
373,superbeast408,"Mila Kunas, I mean come on wtf",6,18 October 2008,"Okay, with Mark wahlberg playing Max I must have went in with my hopes too high. This movie just didn't deliver to the Max Payne fans. Overall it was a good effort for a movie, but they changed lots of plot details, had anti-climatic action sequences, and had a weird set of actors. The special effects were great- A+ there, but thats kinda where it stops. Every action sequence in the movie leaves you saying- thats it? Each one seemed to be missing something. Then there is the broken up plot- which they obviously left parts open for a sequel- but still could have flowed better, maybe another 20-30 minutes of movie would have helped here. Then there's the cast mainly Mila Kunis, does not fit the role, didn't play it well and thank god her role was smaller in the movie than in the games. I was seriously surprised, but glad at how little she does. Other than Mark and Beu, everyone else had average performances. Amaury played his part well, but the character deviates much from the game. Then there was Nelly Furtado (which by the way I just realized it was her on the cast list) I think her character had the best lines in the movie as short as her role was- they summed up Max Payne. And one part that gets me is the complete and total lack of two, count em: two main characters from the game- Vladimer Lem and Alfred Woden. The movie makes it by without them, but only because of the plot changes. I was let down by this one.",Max Payne
374,newyorker329-1,I can not believe how bad this was,1,28 October 2008,"I wish I could give this trash a ""0"". I had hope for this film. I figured out the ending about 5 minutes into the film. The story had zero continuity. All these good actors that sounded like they were reading a script. Someone please tell me why the director had so many long shots of nothing, that lasted for 10 seconds too long before someone entered the scene. And do not even get me started on how bad there attempt was at making it look like they were in NYC. I LIVE HERE...there is no Roscoe Street Subway Station..how hard is it to get the permission to use an actual subway station stop. Terrible Terrible Terrible movie...I only disliked Ultra Violet and the Batman movie with Arnold and friends in it more than this garbage,,,thank goodness I did not pay for this dredge.",Max Payne
375,ApocDX,"Unique, very interesting",8,18 October 2008,"Forget all the ratings from all the critics.This movie is not like those other movies that take things so dramatic and serious, this is a movie that's all about fun. Even though the storyline of Max Payne's tragic background, the movie is more directed to those who have played the video game, an amazing game I might add.The storyline is kind of weird, but you'll understand as the movie progresses, it starts off slow, but ends amazing (WAIT AFTER CREDITS)All in all, Mark Wahlberg played very well as Max Payne, had all the emotions down, and Mona Sax, Mila Kunis just adds on for the hopeful sequel.I give Max Payne an 8.5/10",Max Payne
376,jellingson9,Absolutely...Horrible,2,17 October 2008,"Alright, I'm gonna do it. I'll admit, I'm a huge fan of the game. No, thats not why it was bad. It was just...BAD. Anyone who went to see Harry Potter (or heck, any movie based on a book series or game)ended up being disappointed, because they had high expectations. Or maybe they didn't go see it at all because they knew it would be bad, or disgrace their favorite story. The point is, this movie wasn't horrible because I had high hopes. I don't hate it because they didn't follow the story completely. I hated it because it was a huge load of crap. The movie didn't make sense..it started all Noir, and made you think it was gonna be about this poor guy taking revenge. I thought it would get better. it didn't. Instead, the movie just dragged on, and on, and on, and on. It got worse. They took some characters from both Max Payne games, and threw them into a story about people taking this liquid super soldier drug (by drinking it..wtf?) and hallucinating, seeing these flying demon Valkyries. This is what leads Max Payne to find out this far fetched connection to his Wife and Child's Murder because people are taking the drug and get wings tattooed to protect them, and blah blah. May Payne wasn't a bad a**. He wasn't even that miserable guy you thought would be taking down the bad guys. He just moped and walked the streets of New York for an hour and 45 minutes, carrying a pistol, and shooting in doors and then ingests the drug himself. I don't get it. He never finds Justice. WHAT WHAT THIS GUY THINKING WHEN HE DIRECTED THIS FILM? Not only was the Story butchered, and the characters butchered..but it was just overall a dumb Movie. Punisher was better than this movie. THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE.",Max Payne

378,palach-1,Nothing to do with the game,1,18 October 2008,"I gotta tell you, I'm a big fan of the game. I was so hooked up after the first part that i didn't get up from the computer, when the second part came, until I completed it. Some time ago I came across the info about the movie, I'm always sceptic about video game adaptations and vice versa, I saw the trailer and I thought a good game made into a bad movie. Now I've watched the film, and well, it sucks, they took everything from the game mixed it with some stupid ideas, twisted the story and there you have it. To be honest they used too much cg, if they've spent it on a better script, or hell, just used the script from the game, the movie would have been 10 times greater. The film should have been something like sin city, and the character of Marv played by Mickey Rourke simply dressed in an overcoat, coming through anything they throw at him to find the truth, the story of a lone avenger roaming the street of noir york.And what they made is a psycho story, where there are so much loose ends that you can't keep track of them. Sticking to the truth I can tell that if they kept the script, but changed the names of the characters and the movie wasn't called MAX PAYNE, no selfrespecting man would have gone to see it.",Max Payne
379,ah-amoori,I thought The Happening was disaster !,1,18 October 2008,"let me say this first that i'm a big fan of gaming and Max Payne is one of the best games i've ever played.considering this ,i went and watched this garbage and to tell you the truth i just don't know how they could have come up with this crap of such a great story.The best part of game was the story and the strong dialog; two things the movie doesn't have.Max Payne the game was a masterpiece and still is but this movie is just an attempt to make money by fooling gamers.i couldn't believe Mark Wahlberg played in such a bad movie .when i watched The Happening i told myself where is Mark Wahlberg from Departed but now i think he's making bad decision about his recent movies.and lets face it Mona Sax in this movie was really sucks.I remember Mila Kunis from ""That 70's show"" she was not bad but for God's sake she doesn't not fit in this role.She played like an amateur ,playing around with that MP5? come on! who carries around MP5 all the time? Story of the game was a great film noir story but this movie is not even an average action movie and that's so sad.I was sitting in Theatre and wondering why they didn't give it to David Fincher or at least Robert Rodriguez they could have made a great movie out of Max Payne for sure. I just miss the game when Max was telling the story with those great lines which the movie has none.At the end let me tell you this : ""If you are a gamer and you loved Max Payne,Don't watch this movie it's a waste of your time your money""",Max Payne
380,amanroopsingh,Probably the best video-game adaptation to date.,10,18 October 2008,"It's a good movie. It doesn't necessarily follow the game's plot in every way, but it keeps the same dark tone. It's not that action packed, but really, when you were playing the game, were you more focused on shooting up people, or trying to find out what Max Payne does next? The few action sequences in the movie were amazing, and also followed the slow-motion crap that we saw in the video-game and The Matrix. But if you've seen The Dark Knight, you'd probably think Max Payne is way too boring and too slow, but that was the director's goal, I suppose, and it was the same way in the game. All in all, my expectations were met. Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job, and thankfully, the movie was ALL about Max Payne, and not everyone else involved. 10/10",Max Payne
381,bddmnky,Good Enough,7,19 October 2008,"SO yes Max Payne wasn't all in all 100% accurate to the game, but the main concept and plot was dead on in my opinion. Most games made to movies are horrible and don't even come close like resident evil and still some how get praised. Max Payne on the other hand is much closer to the story line and style and gets put down. No game to movie is ever going to be perfect... just so much dialog and story line missing from games that gives you very little to work with and also in a movie you have to throw in a random hot girl and more effects just because.Sure it was a little slow in the beginning, but all movies have to be built up to the suspense and action. It was a decent flick and not as horrible as all the comments say it is",Max Payne
382,harshbenoitirfan,i am satisfied,9,20 October 2008,"i don't know why the critics think ts rubbish or something like that,,,,probably they might not be knowing much about game turned movies.i myself saw the movie,and i agree,there was a change in the plot line,a slight change,but that didn't push the movie into rags,at least that is what i think.unless you know anything about the game you don't have any right to comment in the film,,,the critics as well as some of you think its not up to the mark because of hallucinating objects seen in the movie,or some scenes which might confuse you,but reality is that you need to go deeper to understand all this according to which i think you don't have the capability.to me the movie was more than good,,and its a thing not just for time pass,but to feel the emotions of the game too by seeing it,it is simply par excellence.the movie might be slow in the beginning,but its speeds up drastically after some time,as from me,,there's a thumbs up!!!!",Max Payne
383,mtprusso,Those who are fans of the video game may be disappointed.,6,20 October 2008,"WARNING IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, AND Don't WANT THE STORY TO BE SPLOILED, DO NOT READ! First off, I am a big fan of the game. .I think The makers of the game didn't ever play the game. All the characters in the movie seem empty and hollow, you don't love or hate them.The movie doesn't ""hook"" you in like the game did. Also the movie follows the storyline, but it overdoes the whole metaphorical battle angle thing. It was a cool idea but overdone. And what was up with Lupino pulling that guy out the window. He was flying!!! Since when did he grow wings??? The action scenes were cool and fun to watch, They go into a lot of detail about the drug which was a big part of the game. However even key parts of the storyline wern't in the movie I thought. Mona was just there as a helper, and Vlad was nowhere to be seen. Nicole Horne who is the one who ordered the killing of Max'sfamily in the game, is hardly in the movie. And Ludicrous plays as Jim Bravura, they must've really been desperate. As much criticism i have on the game there were some cool scenes. And the beginning where Max is face to face with Lupino is a really awesome scene. All in all the movie was decent but didn't live up to the hype. And it definitely had the potential to be a really awesome movie.",Max Payne

""not yet max"".... i wanted my money back.2. The plot. the tattoos... so predictable. the exact instance they showed the company logo, i knew it..3. the action? i expected this movie to be just packed full of it. but no.. and what an anticlimax when the Sgt. is shot in the back by B.B. I wish they had milked the fight between max and the Sgt. a little more. 4. the one dimensional characters.. none of them had the slightest trace of charm and i personally wished max Payne would die at the end of the movie (or even better, just drowned in the lake. saves time) so there would be no possibilities of a sequel. but lo and behold another ""not yet max"" from his deceased wife saves the day.yea but well done with the gritty sceneries. constant rain, snow and darkness throughout the city. that's the only reason why i give this movie the rating of ""3"" instead of ""1"". the first thing i said as i turned to my friend after the movie came to its much anticipated finale was ""hey, remember Doom?""",Max Payne
385,soulja690,You Expect To Much,10,30 October 2008,you guys expect to much from a game movie so far i think this has to be the best made one i mean even though it took awhile to get to the action it was worth it i mean the acting was not that bad mark always pulls off the cool bad guy and he did the best job in this movie i mean the drug tweak was a little weird but hell it made the movie great it gave it a twist and don't compare it to sin city they are way to different the only thing in common is the dark city theme other then that they stand alone. i say people should watch it go and enjoy the gun fight scenes and just kick back i thought it was a great movie anybody who hasn't seen it definitely go check it out.,Max Payne

Sorry for all those who loved this piece of S**T, but it's the reality.. The fact we are facing here is that non of this title's creators watched or tried to play the game ..I may seems a little unfair but that's because i was in a real deep shock They may intended to make it not related to the game . but ? who said this is right ?? I hope 5.4/10 awakes them from their phantasm .. Why Hollywood always want to look different, while they are not ? A Max Payne movie should just looks like a Max Payne Game.. little bloody, More and more action (instead of wiping of real action), Film-Noir style and before all different or little different story .. anyway .. Mark Wahlberg did a great job, also Mila Kunis but she should looks more sexy than that ..

OK, it doesn't follow the video game story but it's really good movie. Yeah, maybe Mark could use his a little more to express Payne's emotions but everything except that is pretty fine. Focus moments are really great looking and snow is really mysterious and it looks the snow from the game. Even better. Effects are realistic and I like those roof-taking-off moments. There are nice quotes like: ""I don't know about Heaven, but I believe in angels."" It has really deep meaning and it fits just perfectly. I've heard that everyone is complaining about Valkyries but I think that they are really powerful spot in the film.

I have to say I don't like Marky boy, but i put enough confidence into the Max Payne franchise so nothing could get wrong.But the worst case happened. Does this film play before the games? Who is Mona Sax in this film? I didn't get it. The bullet-time that made the films so great was only used twice for just a few secs.I think they never played the game really.^^ There's so much i can complain of...So all of you who loved the games and love Det.

As a huge fan of the Max Payne video games (and just noir inspired story telling in general), this will have to be one of the biggest disappointments I can think of, concerning modern action movies.Some directors simply cant even pretend to care just a least bit about the actual quality of the story - and what makes me cry a bit more, is probably that Mark Wallberg was given the main character. I could strole downtown and in 17 minutes or less, find a person better fit for the role as Max Payne, easy. I simply wouldn't pick some ignorant melonhead - such as Mark.Games made into movies, are practically doomed to fail.Right now though, I can only dream nightmares about how Wyck Godfrey and Co. will completely butcher the video game-based movie ""Gears of war"", later in the future.",Max Payne

But the movie...",2,26 November 2008,"All right, as you can see by the 2 out of 10 note I gave it, the movie really didn't fit my long expectation... it was frustrating! The main reason of disliking John Moore's work here is that very feel elements were really taken from the amazing original history of the game: the cop who opens his revenge path through all the underground crime scene till reach the head of the rotten organization is converted just in a sad police officer who just knows to blame life for his pain - Max Payne is really in pain, but despite of the ""dressed-in-black-depressive"" played by Wahlberg, the game shows us a tough guy, who ins't afraid to pull the trigger and has awesome quotes! The comic book language was also totally ignored and left aside. The movie could be really much more interesting if it had adopted some narrative and included some of Payne's irony in its lines. Everything is too much ""gothic"" and ""dark"".Other negative point are the characters roles: a really mess!!! And where is Vladimir Lem? Or the mob family leader Don Punchinello, who sends his guys to kill Payne over the game?I can't forget to talk about the ""bullet time""... it's very, very poor! Could be much better! Good points?

This mean there will be a follow up to this shitty movie because the real ""bad guy"" didn't die. B.B. was supposed to die but instead of killing him at the right place they put him in the ending where the bitch is supposed to die.This movie has very little to do with the game. Sure the names are correct and about 0,5/10 of the story fits in but other than that its just another action movie.. And not even a good one. I gave it a 4/10 as a movie.

Even the role-playing...I played the game, and I have played many games, and seen many game-to-movie and vice versa failures, this my friends is the first time I feel happy about one of those transitions.The original feel to the story of Max Payne comes from pure art, a masterpiece, in creativity and implementation. The scenery, the characters, the monologues, the dialogues even the action. The movie manages to transport a great part of it onto the movie scene, without exaggerating on the CGI or the action bundle, without betraying the original story nor making it impossible to understand for a newcomer.For all that I give this an 8.5 in my mind and a 10 on the db.Tata,G.",Max Payne

On the other hand if you are looking for a plot line with a couple twists that has much potential to entertain, this movie is for you.I had never played the video game before so i cannot comment on its similarity to the game.The actors/actresses in the movie all do a fairly good job and make the film worth watching",Max Payne

Its fun and has a nice story. Compared to other video game movies, this is probably number 2, next to Mortal Kombat. Though, I don't understand all of the hate, this movie is pretty damn good. The acting is decent, and the story is interesting, plus the action is bad-ass even though it is only at the end. The casting is alright, with the acceptance of Mila Kunis and Ludicrous. The special effects are awesome, some of the best I've seen. Overall, it is entertaining but not really a buy to be honest.I'm gonna rent it when it comes on DVD, its pretty good, 8/10.",Max Payne

Only a few action sequences, Payne was not the hard-ass we know and love, no painkillers at all, only one good ""bullet-time"" sequence, and wheres the great narrative inner voice of Max? If they tried to make a stand alone movie, not tied heavily to the game, congrats. You did. Problem is, the game is far superior to the movie. The only slim redeeming quality was the look of the background. They captured a dismal, snowy metropolis perfectly. But then they jack that up by throwing a down pouring rain scene in, and then go back to snow......yeah. Anywho, I could go on, but you get the point.

It is nothing like it should be, everything is missing - the drama, the violence( which really is an important part of the tragical tale of max payne), the dark humor, the characters... everything.Max payne is the tale of a man who looses everything, who doesn't care about anything but personal justice any more and just fights his way through, getting in a worse condition every minute - he gets beaten up, he gets shot and drugged and yet he never gives up.Personally I found many aspects of max payne in sin city.The Max Payne movie however is like the children's edition, there is no pain, no blood( red is the third color next to black and white that is actually needed in max payne), no great bullettime actions, no film noir. The great characters from the game seem all ridiculous, like nicole horn (the evil mastermind) acts like the friendly ant from next door, BB is not nearly the cool suit he should be, no alfred wooden !?, jim bravura needs to be that old wasted guy from the game - and also the extremely precious sideline characters like vinnie (who was such fun to meet in the game) seem all wrong.When they would just have filmed game scene after game scene, level for level the would have provided a better story. The included the wrong unimportant plots from the game but ignored the stuff that really matters.They should have let the guy who cut the trailer make the film, cause it was really an awesome trailer that actually captured a pretty good image of the original Max Payne style.The great funny scenes are gone completely too, you never have to laugh at all, nothing like a gansta in a capt. baseball bat suit...Really, really terrible.The 2 points I give because there are actually some nice images like the valkyries and the drug trips - and because of the super gorgeous Natascha^^ (sister of mona) ... who max did not sleep with, another reason to hate the movie, one of many though...",Max Payne

I'm sorry, but that's how I roll.The disappointing thing about this film is that Max Payne fans have been waiting for a film ever since the first one came out in 2001. Rockstar said they wouldn't do one, they decided to produce The Football Factory instead (which is a brilliant film). But, that only made fans hungry for more. Now, I'll be honest with you. I got really excited when they announce this film was coming out. We had been waiting for it for so long. The man with nothing to lose was going to the big screen. I used to sit and wonder, ""What's the plot line gonna be?"" ""Is it gonna stay true to the game"" and ""Will it be both games in one film?"".The casting of Mark Wahlberg was a peculiar decision. Now, me personally, I've got nothing against Wahlberg. I think he's a fine actor and I really liked him in The Departed. Some may disagree, but that's cool. Your entitled to your opinion. My take on his casting is this: At least they cast someone who at least looks like Max.The problem with this film lies in the script itself. It was written by someone who had only written something minuscule before. But, that's okay, he tried his best. But, for something like Max Payne to go to the big screen, I would have had Sam Lake (The writer of the game) write the script. This version of the Max Payne universe as seen in the film has very little resemblance to the game, it's stunning. Actually, the only thing this film has in common with the game are the place names and characters. It's a shame.But, this film isn't to be sniffed at. There are some genuinely good features about this picture that I like. I like the gritty realism that the game had, I like the bullet time effects used in the action sequences (which I am so glad they kept that in from the game). And the director's visual style is fantastic. The direction seems like it's coming from someone who has actually played the games, it's a shame he had to put up with a terrible script.The only thing I can hope for this film is if they do the same thing they did with The Punisher. Just do another film and start from scratch. I have already though of some potential ideas. I would have had Sam Lake write the script. I would have directed it it in motion capture where the actors are computer generated. You know, Beowulf style, but it'd be darker than that. Sort of Beowulf by way of Sin City. That's be interesting because it would have a sort of video game feel about it. Max would be played by James McCaffey, the original voice of Max. So, with the original writer, actor and a video game style, you'd have enough to keep the film as close to it's origins as you can get. I'd call it Max Payne: Rebirth. To symbolise the restart of the Max Payne franchise and also because when Max's wife dies, he pretty much becomes someone else.Max Payne comes up short of it's delivery, a lot short. But there are still plenty of stylish visuals to be mesmerised by. That's why I give this film a very generous 6/10. It could have been a lot better than it was. Let's just hope Max Payne: Rebirth comes out soon.",Max Payne
401,isaacdolling,OK. Had potential to be great.,5,21 April 2009,"First i must start with- I actually didn't mind this film. And would give it 6.Having played the game, i was sorely disappointed. This movie had potential to be great, the game was very dark and riddled with seedy, blood strewed flash backs. What made the game so appealing for me was the fact that this man had everything, suddenly everything was taken away and he was left an empty shell of a man looking for the nothing but truth and vengeance. That fact that he would do anything to find out more information, he didn't fear death because he had nothing to live for. Max doesn't knock scum down and run, he pick up gun a finishes them.Where is that in the movie? Attempted in some scenes but just didn't cut it for me. With the exception of the shotgun scene; that scene was great, dark, shadowy and brutal, for the first time in the movie I believed his intimidacy.",Max Payne
402,msmackie,"Tiresome, boring movie lacking the suspense of the games.",1,25 June 2009,"Very recently, I watched this movie on DVD, unfortunately the cut version rated 16+ here in Germany. Well, I was tired before - and almost fast asleep afterward. First of all, this was boring to the core. Where was the suspense I knew from the games? Were was Max' sharp tongue and desperation? And what happened to Max' stunning facial expressions we could see in the games? This Max Payne was just a body. No pain, no soul, no passion, no rage. Besides, the slow-mo shots didn't impress me at all. I would have thought the team was able to turn the bullet time into something worth watching - but they failed. I could even enjoy Hit-man as the movie it was, but Max Payne was too much. The only thing I could enjoy in the beginning was the settings. The streets looked like I knew them from the games, they even felt similar. This makes the one star I can give this movie.Maybe there's more action in the uncut version, but this was lame. I love the games - still - but I am definitely not going to watch this movie ever again. Rather play the games than watch the actors struggle their way into and through a story none of the team seems to have grasped at all.",Max Payne
403,whoisthestengl,Better than you think!,7,29 June 2009,"OK, so lets make this clear, before I watched this movie I only heard negative stuff about it, that the story was bad and it did not make much sense. My only relevant experience was the game, which I really liked ( and after all it is quite important this is based on that, it is not just some random action movie )so I was looking for that eerie feeling and kind of strange frightening world. On this aspect the movie did brilliantly. Don't get me wrong, this it far from being an epic action movie, like Die Hard or will make you think about it, like Swordfish. The story is a bit simple and there are other flaws also. Despite all that I believe it it worth watching once, even if you did not play the game. However if you did and you want to relive that twisted world, you must see it. I personally watched it two times the first time, some of the scenes are astonishing and the whole movie has the seems feeling as the game. So in conclusion it is a decent movie if you have a couple of hours to kill, and watch it as soon as you can if you are a fan of the game.",Max Payne
404,Delos-Dinh,"Short review of it being a movie and not how good an adaptation it was/is; hence, not bias.",2,13 January 2010,"I never played the game so I had a clean slate when I went to watch the movie. Thus, I can truly criticise the film based on it being a movie and not how good an adaptation it was/is; hence, not bias.To me... this movie was horrible. It was so terrible that I wanted my money back (okay only an expression). The movie was anticlimactic nearly all the time and rarely catches the attention of the audiences.The worst aspect of the movie and also the best is the CGI and the visual effects. Though brilliant, fascinating and visually pleasing, it was completely unnecessary and does not contribute anything to the plot or characters. However, without it, the movie will be even lower than what I think of it.Another thing I really hated was the so called 'symbolism"" in the movie. There were way too many inappropriate and redundant references and allusions to Ragnarök and the Valhalla. Only someone who is really below average intelligence would think the use of these allusion was brilliant; someone saying something like this in their head: ""Wow they are using biblical allusions, that's genius, it must be good"". Yes I have encounter someone saying this and I really resent that person for that comment. It could be me being stupid and not understanding it but seriously, they make it seem so important when it really isn't. The film didn't explain this properly and it didn't make enough strong links. Therefore, the film failed in relating to the audience.I've watched this ages ago so I can't remember much, only that I really hated the movie. So unfortunately, I can't remember much of the acting; thus, I can't complain/praise that aspect of the movie.Judging from the comments, it could have been a really awesome movie, but it wasn't. What a shame.I don't recommend buying/downloading/watching this.",Max Payne
405,hellyeahblake,A Disappointment,3,27 February 2010,"Let me say this: With a minimal budget and my friends, I could have made a movie that satisfied fans better than this one did. And at every point in the film, I'm wondering why ""Damn! Why didn't they do this?"" or ""Why did they refuse to put this in and instead do this?"". But even more than I think that, I am wondering why the heck they didn't play the game.I am an avid Max Payne fan. I do not hate this movie, but I am severely disappointed. So many things were missing that could've captured the essence of Max Payne, that could've made you care about the characters.So, what do we have? A flashy, matrix-style action-thriller with little substance. Sadly, though, Max Payne is more substance and character than flashy gunfights and creepy-looking Valkyrie, and Fox didn't seem to notice this when they refused to do their research on the game? I mean, who does that?Apparently, if these people are too lazy to play a VIDEO GAME,a reference which would have made the movie better ten times over, then what does this say about the effort put into production? All style and no substance, Max Payne is a sore experience best left avoided. If you want your Max Payne fix, shell out the cash at your local Gamestop.",Max Payne
406,martinwel,This film is the game,6,24 April 2010,"I have no idea what film some of these reviewers have seen. I played both games and read some opinions before watching and I was expecting a mess. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the film was very faithful to the game. From the 3rd person FPS camera angle to the near death dream sequences, the director must have played the game (or at least watched it being played).I thought the acting was good and all the characters from the game rang true, except Wahlburg as Payne who seemed lost at several points like he had forgotten his wife and his motivation. I also would have loved to have seen more bullet time. Max diving behind a bar, taking out 6 guys with a desert eagle, although completely unrealistic, was the best thing about the games and the film moved quite slowly in parts for lack of that. (And a lack of painkillers, Mark/Max should checked more cupboards.) The V! special effects (a la Constantine!) were not needed and detracted from the gritty, real feel that was attempted. The supernatural elements felt tacked on.Overall, the film didn't quite achieve its aim but it is none the less enjoyable for what it is. The art here is not in film noir or graphic novels but in that, while the game plays like a movie, this movie looks like a game.",Max Payne

The special effects sequences are superb and a surprise bonus.Mark Wahlberg is intense as Max Payne and I got behind the character from the start.Mila Kunis plays the part of Mona Sax very well.

410,teddies_are_cute-222-771311,Visually Interesting.,6,25 November 2011,"I will admit that I have not played the games, and I would presume that it would change my opinion of this film, however, as a standalone film, it's interesting.The plot/script was meh. There wasn't really anything great in it, nothing there really. Having not played the game, but having read the reviews it does appear that the plot is at all canonical with the game from which it's based. Therefore, I decided to keep watching due to the visuals.The best aspect of the film was the visual one; visually the film has many beautiful scenes that are visually intriguing. And there were many good fight scenes, although, not that I thought them sparse, just simply spaced out. It was interesting for an action movie, not to have ever second covered in blood and bullets.I give my rating of 6/10 for it's visual elements, which impressed me. The dialogue/scripting and plot needed work, and the actors didn't really have much to work with, as such I don't have much of an opinion on the standard of acting.As such, I'd recommend watching the film for eye candy, but don't bother if you're looking for an intelligent, beautifully written film.",Max Payne
411,acevro,"I never played the game and enjoyed this film, and here is why;",7,5 January 2013,"It is important to note that I am reviewing this movie as a viewer, and not a gamer. I would also like to note that this film, in my opinion, was heavily underrated for what it actually brought to the table. So let us look at it from the standpoint of someone who had not played the game. The movie is essentially the story of a man seeking revenge for the death of his family, (given) is a classical character archetype. So lets look at what this film did differently from many other recent films of the same ""genre"". This film tries to incorporate a noir feeling in its atmosphere, and I must say, it does that flawlessly. The film itself is art, the way they have depicted the city and the atmosphere is visually stunning, this sold me completely. The acting of the movie's stars, on the other hand, doesn't seem fully complete, definitely lacking at times, but for me that did not draw me away from the excitement of the film all too much. The action sequences also bring something different, their style and coordination is enticing at times, and really drew my attention as a viewer. Now I am not arguing that this movie is a masterpiece, or Oscar material, or even anything more than a pleasant viewing experience. All I am arguing, is that this movie succeeded in entertaining me, and after I saw the film, it succeeded in giving me something a bit more afterwards; a desire to play the game. Many things could have used a lot of work, but the final product we are left with is a visually stunning and exciting action film that really depicts something different from other recent Hollywood blockbusters, and I think different is exactly what the film industry needs right about now.",Max Payne
412,Jexic,Terrible,1,8 April 2012,"This movie adaptation may be the worst thing I have ever seen. I saw it when it came out and hated it and haven't seen it since, until tonight. I ran through Max Payne in a sitting on PC then popped in the movie to compare and fairly judge the film, but for an adaptation you need to look at it from two angles:Adaptation: This movie fails on almost every aspect of the adaptation. If the names of the characters were different I may think to myself, well this movie kind of reminds me of Max Payne, but, meh, it's a coincidence. Seriously. Remove the names of everything and it's not an adaptation. I wouldn't have been surprised to find out Fox changed the name of a script they already had and said ""hey, go make us a Max Payne movie now. Apparently that's what the kids like. Speaking of kids, despite the adult themed game in terms of violence, sleaziness, and atmosphere make it PG-13."" I know they didn't cut anything really to get the rating after filming, but there's so much they cut out before filming knowing the rating. For a game that doesn't take a break from the massacre, it's odd this adaptation has two action scenes. The plot bounces around and changes almost every aspect from the game.Stand Alone Quality: Also a failure. If I didn't ever lay the game I'd still hate this movie. It sucks. It looks cool and it's sad to see flickers of promising ideas and artistic creation, but in general this movie is bad. Acting is terrible. Plot is terrible. Direction is a problem in scenes in terms of over directing, confusing camera cuts and effects, and the entire inclusion of Valkyries and hallucinations. This movie is filled with holes and a stench of terribleness. Do yourself a favor and lobotomize yourself if you've seen it or run away if you haven't. THIS MOVIE IS BAD.",Max Payne
413,mndt,A Game Acted by Singers,7,13 February 2009,"I watched the unrated version yesterday. I wasn't expecting much. It was fun and was worth seeing it. I am a fan of the game. The second one is my best game ever. The movie more or less is loyal to the game story, and Max Payne has one of the best stories in the game industry. What you should know is that there is a gap between plots in game industry and the movie industry, and I don't see how being loyal is a good thing where you could have taken a pen and filled the plot holes.Now, anyone who has played Max Payne knows that it is different because of two things: The monologues and the slow motion thing. The movie has only one monologue at the beginning. I'm sorry but you are going to miss that so much, it almost hurts. There are some pretty good slow motion scenes in the movie but John Moore, instead of following max in slow motion, has usually preferred to follow the bad guys. Then Max comes out of nowhere and kills them with amazing speed which makes it hard to connect with Max. I at least expected to see the famous scene with Max flying across the screen in slow motion, shooting with both hands.Although Mila Kunis does her best as Mona Sax, Mona in game has a darkness deep in her which I can't find in this cute actress. And I can't believe Beau Bridges as BB Hensley can be that bad, he is too likable and perhaps too old to jump from a window. Casting could have been different.In the end whether you are a fan or not you should at least rent this movie. I hope the follow up pushes the door further for future game adaptations.",Max Payne

416,treyt1988,Max Payne,8,24 April 2013,"Max Payne is a suspenseful movie that had me on the edge of my seat till the end of the very end. This is probably one of the best movies I have watched all year. This movie is an older movie, it released in 2008. The director of this movie is John Moore. The cast of this movie is a great line up. Some of the key characters of this film are played by Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and Beau Bridges.Mark Wahlberg plays Max Payne a widowed cop who is determined to find the people responsible for his wife's and child's murder. He conducts an investigation in the shadows and starts to unravel a much bigger problem. He teams up with a sexy assassin (Mila Kunis) who is trying to avenge her sister's death. They stumble into a drug operation that is tied directly to both of their loved ones deaths. Maxes mentor B.B. Hensley (Beau Bridges) is the closest thing to family that Max has left, and he has a dark secret he is keeping from Max.The cast of this movie did an outstanding job. Mark Wahlberg is a great action star and he lives up to the hype in this movie. He kept me believing that the danger was right around the corner. Mila Kunis was a great addition to the lineup. She wasn't who I would figure for the role of stole cold killer, because she stared on a TV sitcom as a ditsy high school girl. She knocked this role out of the park. Beau Bridges is an actor I know little about. He was a perfect pick for the role he has in this movie though.There are countless special effects that are used in this movie. The sound effects are done to a high quality that makes the movie feel like its right in your lap. The visual effects are done",Max Payne
417,mahauser,....future generations will view this as a landmark film,10,28 April 2009,"This review refers to the unrated director's cut. This is an ambitious film, one which hits all the high notes without straining. OK, maybe 10 stars is a bit much, but definitely a solid 9 1/2 stars for me. The extra 1/2 star is because I believe the film to be of a type very difficult to do well. Not only does it have a compelling, reasonably intelligent plot but actors that carry it along without once dropping the ball. It also boasts stunning, near psychedelic digital special effects, magnificent cinematography and a brilliant understated film score which brings the action into clear focus without ever overwhelming it. Any one of these alone would be worth the price of admission. I'm not a gamer and most action films leave me feeling something was missing, but I loved this film. I watched it on a small computer screen and feel certain viewing it on the large screen would result in an even more spectacular impression. So why were the critics and so many of the public so down on this film? I can't really say other than to speculate that its parentage in a video game made it an easy mark and the manner in which it blends aspects of film noir with those of action flicks was too much for some to deal with. Some wanted more over-the-top action, some less. Still I can't understand how anyone who enjoyed The Dark Knight or Blade Runner could fail to like Max Payne. I'm confident future generations will view this as a landmark film, as Casablanca and the aforementioned Blade Runner are viewed today. Don't let the naysayers keep you from seeing this film.

As a non-gamer knowing little to nothing about Max Payne I understood and enjoyed the storyline. Why, because I pay attention, unlike others who are just there because its a movie based on a video game they like to play. When in relation to its direction and action, this film is art. The storyline is proper heavy noir stuff. And Mark Whalberg blew me away, and though this is not by far everyone's first choice I find him effective, deep, angry, yet venerable. People really ought to go in watching this movie with no prejudice or with little intention to compare to the video game. You need to have a serious mind set, this is not a casual viewing film, but once you get into it, the film is gripping and suspenseful.

It didn't require much (if any) adaptation for the screens, it was already a proved success. What they did here was destroy the game's name and create another unsuccessful game to movie adaptation. Even the characters were horribly adapted and some even deleted from the story. Seeing this kind of movie makes me question the seriousness of these people work.

420,szamarin,A Major Disappointment,3,24 November 2008,"Given that Max Payne is one of my favorite video game characters of all time, I was initially excited to finally see him brought to life on the big screen. Alas after 90 minutes of this drivel, my hopes were crushed, and I was left to ponder as to how someone can produce such a poor excuse of a movie, given that a masterful and compelling story was already laid out for them in a video game. In fact this movie reminded of a recent South Park episode where the boys witness the"" raping"" favorite hero, Indiana Jones, in the latest Lucas movie.This movie fails on so many levels, it is almost as if the movie makers deliberately tried to make it awful as it can possibly be. For those who have not played the game, the premise is as follows. Coming home one day to find his wife and newborn baby brutally murdered with no apparent motive or cause, Max Payne loses all faith in life and begins accepting dangerous assignments while investigating the trafficking of the illicit drug Valkyr. While deep undercover, Max's cover is blown, and subsequently he is framed for the murder of a fellow DEA agent, who also happens to be one of two people who are aware of Max's deep cover. These two plot elements help define Max's character as he finds himself between a rock and a hard place, hunted by the police and the mafia, with no one to turn to for help, Max must survive with only his wits and gun wielding abilities. I was extremely disappointed to find out that the second element of the plot is missing from the movie. Instead, the movie makers thought Max would be a more compelling character if he held a desk job during the day, and investigate his wife's murder as a vigilante by night.The plot was watered down significantly, and at times made so illogical that it felt like the writers were confused as to how the story should proceed. Those that played the game, will instantly be able to detect where the plot is going just by the names of the characters, even though some of them play different roles in the story. Those that have not played, will still be able to see twist coming from a mile away as the story is pretty straightforward and predictable.While Mark Wahlberg does a decent job with the role, the movie's Max Payne lacks the charm, wit, and the dark sense of humor of his video game counterpart. In fact the movie takes no advantage of the protagonist's unique name as if there's no innuendo behind it, changing the character's name to Max Berman would have no effect on the movie. The same holds true for other characters as well. Mila Kunis while attractive does a poor job of portraying Mona, as instead of a femme fatale that she was in the game, Mona comes of as being more of a tom boy with a gun.While I don't think that the movie makers should have followed the game's plot entirely, they could have definitely done a better job of capturing the essence of it. I don't think that they had to necessarily play through the entire video game to do this as most of the game's plot unfolds that graphic novel cut scenes. Had they spent some time going over these graphic novel sequences, I'm sure they could've formulated a much better plot. On the bright side, I don't think I'll be much disappointed with the sequel since my expectations are now extremely low.",Max Payne

How would the would be in our time, hes a COP remember guys. I'm glad I only played the game once that gave me the luxury of taking it for what it is a great movie, if you are a true Marky fan like me u will not be disappointed, anybody that has panned this movie needs to forget about the game and watch it again, if you cant, then leave the movie alone, turn your video game back on, and shut the hell up!",Max Payne
422,Meteoroid,Almost a total waste of time.,4,25 May 2009,"If you're looking for an action-packed thrill-ride look elsewhere. Max Payne is an action film with little action most of the time. What's the point in that?If you like the game, then I recommend you just play it again, rather than watching this. The story, about a guy out for revenge, (all you need to know) while similar, has somehow been made worse. The scenery and action scenes copy elements from the game, which make up the few redeeming qualities of the film. but are not anywhere near as engrossing or fun as actually playing the game.The actors had very little to work with here. While the game was purposely quite cheesy, which added atmosphere, the actors seem to be just reading their lines. More than likely just thinking about their paychecks.If you haven't seen this film, well take it or leave it. You miss nothing if you give it a pass, but I would say that if you have very low expectations and are willing to sit through a long film for a few action scenes and a predictable story then give it a try. It could have been a lot worse, and if you're still around twelve or remember what it was like being that age you might find it passable. This is why I give it a 4.",Max Payne

Also, I will never be able to take Mila Kunis as a cold-blooded trained killer. There were only two real action sequences that I can remember in the film, and neither of them were very satisfying. Last Year's Shoot 'Em Up makes for a much better adaptation of what is one of my favorite video games of all time. I don't know when people will learn that adapting a Video game to the big screen doesn't mean totally rearranging the story and characters, but I hope it is soon.

425,Shylo__A,Terrible Movie....Just Awful,2,20 October 2008,"This movie is absolutely terrible, they took the game, cut out 80% of the story line and changed the rest. They took out 99% of the action, and they barely stayed true to the game at all. Max does two bullet time dives.... two... that's it folks. The most revolutionary thing about this game is not even represented in the movie. The plot is totally twisted away from the original story, in that it is barely recognizable, and Marky Mark is about as full of emotion as a corpse. I waited 7 years for this movie, and after all this hoping, it does not even stay true to the fans that supported the game. These are the fans that made it popular for crying out loud. Max has not one disturbing nightmare, instead, Max is part of the 1% of the population who takes V and turns into a superhero rather than an unstable junkie. Gone is the film noir, metaphor spewing, gun wielding, wisecracking Max Payne we all have come to love. In comes the emotionless, boring, average Payne. Many of the characters that helped to make the video game's story so great are pulled, such as Vlad and Alfred Woden, not to mention the fact that Detective Jim Bravura, who in the game is a sixty-ish year old man with gray hair, is replaced by a twenty five year old rapper (who didn't do too bad of a job acting). They also manage to cut out the whole part of the story involving the mob, as well as the helicopter battle in the end. Every time Max kills someone, it is quick and action-less, with the exception of two times. Maybe if I had not played the game, I wouldn't be so angry, but I still think this is a terrible movie.",Max Payne

Yet, their acting in this film was poor. The movie is inconsistent, shot in the left shoulder in one scene, then the next no shot? Then, shot at least 10 times (at least twice in the heart) and still alive? The story would have been better if things were consistent, and that horrible 80's low budget movie sound effects weren't used. Also, the computer effects were on the poor side. Overall, the movie was fine, besides the acting that makes you cringe, the computer effects that make you close your eyes, and the sound track that at times makes you want to plug your ears.",Max Payne
427,SirGii,Not bad but it could have been so much better...,4,12 April 2009,"...especially 'cause I have been really looking forward to this movie!As a huge fan of the game (both parts) I hoped for a entertaining movie with a great story, a wicked photography and a sinister tone. Well, I wasn't let down completely. Unfortunately Mark (Marky Mark) Whalberg and Mila Kunis were major miscasts in my opinion, don't get me wrong, I like them both as actors, but didn't really carry the dark side of the movie. The action was OK, almost great sometimes and so was the photography when it caught the ambiance of the game, but I still I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. Even the moments that felt like the game (and there are a few) couldn't help the fact, that I could have been made so much better! Give me Clive Owen as Max Payne the SloMo Moves of John Woo, Summer Glau as Mona Sax and some of Terry Giliams dire imagination and this could have been a movie for eternity! In the end I have to say: If you know Max Payne as a game, don't expect too much! If you don't, expect a quite entertaining action flick.4/10 ('cause I loved the game - and was let down by the movie)",Max Payne
428,kael99,"An entertaining film with many, MANY, flaws. (Minor Spoiler)",6,27 November 2008,"The Max Payne video game series is phenomenal. The movie, not so much.The story revolves around a cop who's family has been murdered. The beginning of the film starts much too quickly, rushing the viewer right into the action without much character or plot buildup, which in the long run definitely hurts the film.The plot is convoluted, and much has changed from the game. If the game were made into a movie pretty much scene-for-scene, it would have been better. The implementation of the film noir style from the game is mediocre at best, and many obvious goofs hinder the enjoyability of the film.The deep emotional investment in the characters that comes from playing the slick, stylish game with gritty overtones and very cool cutscenes, voiceovers, graphic-novel segments, and the fantastic attention to detail from the games is gone (the TV shows were awesome!), replaced by pseudo feelings derived from Marky Mark's low-toned voice, which in reality is more like running your brain over a cheese grater.The casting is hugely flawed, with the exception of Mark Wahlberg as Max Payne (he did an acceptable job, and looks remotely similar to Max Payne, but someone better could have been chosen) and Amaury Nolasco as Jack Lupino, but all that doesn't really matter as you never get to really experience the characters. Rather, there is just shooting and random apocalyptic apparitions.-HOWEVER- The movie is still enjoyable if you turn off your brain while watching it. The action is cool, and the special effects are pretty awesome. Don't expect to get smarter while watching it, but don't count it out as a terrible movie either.So much more could have been done with this film, as the game has vast potential for an outstanding film adaptation. Sadly, this is not that film. It really upsets me that this was the best they could do, because it's not like they can go back and make it again and shout ""DO OVER! MY BAD!"" as that is not how the movie industry works.Despite its many shortcomings, this film is one of the better game-based movies, and an average action film. Don't come into it looking for the next Die Hard, but you can still enjoy it nonetheless.",Max Payne
429,Fullmetal_X,Does Max Payne Deliver? Yes...yes it does.,8,18 October 2008,"Worse film of the year? Hell no. Best film of the year? Not even close. But, for what it is, and given Hollywood's tendency to turn video game adaptations into complete and utter crap, Max Payne does what it's supposed to do; entertain. The story is not complex, but it isn't dull either. Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a haunted police detective whose sole motivation is to find the ""third man"" who was responsible for the murder of his wife and baby. Three years prior to the film, junkies high on a new drug, Valkyr, broke into Max's home while he was away. Arriving a little too late, Max shoots two of the junkies but one gets away. However, as Max delves deeper and deeper into his obsession with solving the case, he's surprised to find that the incident goes far deeper than just a couple of lowlife scumbags.The film is criticized for its lack of action, the script and incoherent plot but, in all honesty, there is nothing wrong with the plot or the writing. It's not Shakespeare, but it gets the job done. The plot makes sense and the acting wavers between tolerable and good (Wahlberg's performance, I will say, is solid; probably the most solid of the entire cast). It's not gonna win any Oscars but the film manages to capture the dark tone and feel of the game. As for the action, I'm actually glad that the film wasn't full of over the top, flashy gunfights. They work well to string together a plot in a video game (it's practically necessary, due to the interactivity of the medium), but the game's primary feature, in this reviewer's opinion, is the story. The action, when it does come into the film, is necessary, properly set up, and justified since, by that point, you've seen the characters for who they really are. It's an interesting take and probably one of the better video game adaptations out there.If you're expecting a carbon copy of the game and will settle for nothing less, you might want to skip this one. The film diverges from the game's plot but the basic structure and storyline is similar and it works well. And, given the tone and look of the film, it's actually quite appropriate.7.5/10",Max Payne
430,chrisbutler-1,Terrible.,1,3 November 2008,"Remember when Mark Wahlberg won an Academy Award? Yeah, neither can I.Seriously, NOTHING happens in this film. Mark Wahlberg, somehow thinking ""stoicism"" means ""rather than act or affect any character motive whatsoever just talk every line of dialogue like you're reading a manual on how to replace a filter element on a tractor engine"", pisses and moans his way through a plot that feigns being convoluted (but turns out to be about as complex as its vague reference to soldiers in the Middle East is relevant), ultimately providing dud answers for questions nobody cares about, such as: ""Chris O'Donnell - whatever happened to that guy?"" and ""How do you make the brutal slaying of a baby boring?"" Mark Wahlberg, the whole time looking more concerned with getting the scene over with so he can go home, just frowns and sighs throughout the whole film - and that's really all the film is: one big sigh of disappointment, where even the sets look embarrassed to be there.Whereas the game puts a genuinely dark and interesting twist on film-noir clichés, this film strips the Max Payne narrative of everything that made it exciting in game form. The game was seminal in creating the popularity of bullet time, yet the film - somehow keeping bullet time as the ace in the sleeve to be unveiled at the gripping climax - manages to remind everyone what a bored and hackneyed cliché cinema bullet time has become. What the film crew should have done is go into someone's living room and film them playing Max Payne on their computer from start to finish. Seriously, an adaptation of ""Lemmings"" would have been more exciting than this film.",Max Payne
431,silverdragon_21,make and opinion of your own,7,15 January 2009,listen I'm no movie freak like this Max cine 89 or whatever. but i actually enjoyed this movie i think that when someone is able to tear apart a somewhat descent film their over analyzing it. has anyone ever heard of artistic vision. its what a director gets paid for. I'm pretty sure he really doesn't care what some person with a screwed view on films to begin with and with too much time on there hands has to say about his work. money speaks for itself and this movie got my money and my respect. so do yourself a favor go out rent the movie if your curious enough get the game its old but fun for crying out loud enjoy the movie for what its there for. the story and entertainment don't be an idiot just because some guy wrote a 3 page description on how he hated it.,Max Payne
