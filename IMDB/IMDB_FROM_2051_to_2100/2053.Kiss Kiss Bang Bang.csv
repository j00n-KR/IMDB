0,MartinHafer,Exceptionally inventive---but NOT for the kids!,8,14 August 2006,"This was a really interesting film that tried to be very different. While some of the elements remind me of old Film Noir, the comedic and downright strange elements make this an interesting film that transcend the usual fare from Hollywood. Unfortunately, because the ""F word"" is used about 169 times and because of some brief nudity here and there, this is definitely NOT a film for everyone. And this really is a shame, because without these elements, I could see this film appealing to a much broader audience. I really would have loved to show this to my teenage daughter, but it just wouldn't be appropriate--and she really would have enjoyed it.Robert Downey, Jr. does an exceptional job acting and narrating (in the most peculiar manner I have seen since SUNSET BOULEVARD) and it's a shame his self-destructive habits have hurt his career--he really is a very talented man. Val Kilmer is pretty good as his gay detective friend and the rest of the class does just fine. However, the biggest star of the film are the writers who manage to provide tons of twists and turns and odd moments (I especially loved the scene with the finger and the dog--I won't spoil it by saying any more). While not every twist was believable, there were enough wonderful moments to make you ignore the parts that fell somewhat flat.This is a good film for people who are looking for a very gritty mystery comedy (that's an odd combination isn't it?) or somewhat who is just tired of the ""same old, same old"" and is looking for a change. But whatever you do DON'T watch this with the kids around!!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
1,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly funny murder mystery,7,29 November 2012,"A surprisingly inventive little comedy/mystery movie with a tightly-written script and a high ratio of successful laughs. Much of the film gets by alone on the charisma of Robert Downey Jr., who's the most assured and comfortable I've ever seen him; I'm no fan of his arrogant character in the IRON MAN films but he gets the balance between vulnerable and cocky just right here and it's my favourite performance from him yet.The plot is a complex, noir-ish little murder mystery in which Downey Jr. (a thief masquerading as an actor) and his buddy, Val Kilmer (playing a gay cop) find themselves out of their depth as corpses pile up and hit men seem to pursue them at every interval. In many ways it's a riff on the classic buddy-buddy cop movie like LETHAL WEAPON with a few twists and modern spins on the formula to keep it fresh.Shane Black, who writes and directs, is a seasoned professional in this genre and his quiet assurance results in a film that it's difficult not to like. Val Kilmer is very good (and funny) as the self-assured cop and Michelle Monaghan makes for a rather lovely femme fatale. A rash of bizarre situational comedy situations adds to the fun and as a result this is something a bit different from the norm. My favourite moments are the little asides that Downey Jr. almost throws away constantly, spoofing the industry at the same time.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
2,SnoopyStyle,Frantic RDJ,7,18 November 2013,"Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) is a petty thief and escape into the LA scene. He gets into the PI business with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer). At the same party, he reunites with his childhood friend Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan). Later she hires him to investigate her sister's suspicious death. Meanwhile somebody is trying to frame him for a high profile murder.RDJ is rapid fire frantic and breaking down the 4th wall in his narrations. Michelle Monaghan is super hot. Val Kilmer is uncomfortably odd as the sometimes-gay PI.The story is a little bit convoluted. It's not a great mystery, but that's not their strength. It's a wacky comedic spin on the hard boiled detective genre. It is very manic, but not necessarily laugh out loud. It is frantic and crazy. And it coasted on RDJ's energetic performance.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
3,Hitchcoc,I Can't Put My Finger on It (Or the Dog Ate It)!,7,17 September 2010,"Like so many movies that are simply tongue in cheek, this one loses credibility when the joke goes on too long. I the pain inflicted on Robert Downey were real, he would be in agony. He recovers so fast and is then forced into incredibly physical activity at the drop of a hat. Then there's the case, running around, trying to figure out what Val Kilmer is up to and respond to it. While this movie is rife with comic scenes and action, it's hard at times to figure out who the bad guys are. Not only that, but their participation in the whole charade depends on them doing things that are not done easily (moving bodies around, for instance). Other than his sexual aspirations, how can Downey continue to punish himself over this unstable female and her life. At some point you need to cut your losses. But, hey, this is Hollywood where the coyote comes back in the next scene, even though he has dropped 800 feet off a cliff. It's just a monumental joke and other than the episodic nature and the narration, to obtuse to get too involved in.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
4,Prismark10,The Harry and Perry show,7,28 March 2014,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a post modern hard boiled crime thriller with tongue in cheek comedy elements.It mixes brutal violence, crime noir and some laughs and the engine of the film is provided by the screen chemistry of Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer.Downey plays a petty thief who whilst escaping the police ends up in an audition and impresses the casting agents who introduce him to a gay Private eye to (Kilmer) to get some on the job experience.However both them soon get mixed up in mystery involving a retired actor, his estranged daughter, a childhood friend and a corpse in a trunk of a car.The film is written and directed by Shane Black who created the Lethal Weapon franchise and in the early 1990s was one of the highest paid screenwriters about. Yet the film only got a limited release and was regarded as a disappointment. This was before Downey struck it rich in the Iron Man movies.The film is well paced, keeps moving, the narration by Downey adds a lot of quirkiness. Downey and Kilmer make a great team with just the right amount of humour and gay jokes. The action is tough, the ladies sexy and it makes for an entertaining film.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
5,claudio_carvalho,"Los Angeles, Land Without Police",7,8 July 2006,"In LA, while escaping from the police after an unsuccessful robbery, the small time thief Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) is accidentally submitted to an audition for a role of detective in a movie, and invited to a party. He meets the homosexual private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), who suggests him to participate of an investigation to develop his character. He also meets the gorgeous aspirant actress Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), and finds that she was a friend of his childhood for whom he had a crush. Harry and Perry get involved in an intricate murder case with many leads. With the support of Harmony, they find the sordid truth of the case.""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a funny, but also violent, action movie with an original screenplay, where the lead character is actually the narrator of the events. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in the role of the loser Harry Lockhart and shows a great chemistry with the delicious Michelle Monaghan, and also with his gay partner Val Kilmer. The story in a certain moment becomes very confused with many subplots, but in the end all of them are satisfactorily resolved. The usually efficient police, at least in American movies, apparently vanished in Los Angeles, since there are countless car chases and shootings without any police action. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Beijos e Tiros"" (""Kisses and Shots"")",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

But I think it's obvious what I mean: You have so many cool, fresh, good, exciting and (fill your own word in here) quotes, that you could use and cherish ... for quite some time. And of course the jokes had to be great, what with the mastermind Shane Black behind it all, of Lethal Weapon and Last Boy Scout fame! But he also directed this one, to be sure no one would mess up his beautiful script perhaps? That's just a guess, but I'm surprised, that there isn't another recent project attached to his name.But back to the movie for a little bit, which I won't spoiler for you. But I can tell you, that you're in for a big treat ... and if you like action/detective/comedy movies all mixed together, than you will love this! Especially as it doesn't takes itself to serious!

7,classicsoncall,"""This is every shade of wrong.""",8,20 May 2012,"It didn't take long to realize this film would be a blast. The opening set up (following the colorfully stylized opening credits) is all wink and nod as petty thief Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) finds himself in a jam with the cops and makes his escape via a film audition. Watching that scene I had to wonder why the audition was going on in what looked like a tenement building, but hey, just go with it and try not to think about it too much.It will probably help not to think too much about everything that follows as well. Which doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention. There are so many twists and turns in this flick that at times it doesn't seem to make any sense, but then things manage to come together for a genuinely sleek and effective noir styled thriller. If I had my way, the picture could have toned down some of the self referential business, because after a while it begins to get a bit pretentious. But the cool thing is that Downey manages to make most of it work pretty well. The dialog is crisp and funny, and his pairing with Val Kilmer is one of the more effective team-ups without actually turning into a buddy movie. Interestingly, even though Kilmer's Gay Perry is supposed to be just that, the film doesn't indulge in any gratuitous homo-eroticism to make a point.Even if you don't go for stuff like this, there would seem to be something here for everyone. It's the rare film that will offer up lessons on conjugating adverbs successfully, and if you're an old time TV and movie fan like myself, you'll delight in anticipating the obligatory explanation of the name of Harmony's airline stewardess gal pal - ""Flicka, Flicka. You know, my friend?"" If you don't get that one, you really should look it up.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
8,jboothmillard,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,7,4 December 2009,"From director Shane Black, who played Hawkins in Predator, I wasn't expecting a lot from this film, even knowing the cast, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Basically Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) is a petty New York thief, also narrating, taking us through the story and explaining his opinions on things, including the film itself. He accidentally goes for a screen test to play a detective, and to get inspiration for his character, private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) suggests he helps him in an investigation. He also reunites himself with old childhood school friend, and crush, aspiring actress Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan). When a murder has occurred, and Harmony's sister has also committed suicide, Perry wants Harry's real help in the case, and all the party guests they met are suspects. Also starring The Dentist's Corbin Bernsen as Harlan Dexter, Dash Mihok as Mr. Frying Pan, The Nutty Professor's Larry Miller as Dabney Shaw, Rockmond Dunbar as Mr. Fire, A Knight's Tale's Shannyn Sossamon as Pink Hair Girl and Angela Lindvall as Flicka. Downey Jr. is very likable as the lead and narrator, Kilmer makes a great one-liners support for him, and it a good mix of quirky humour and sometimes quite intriguing action, a good comedy thriller. Robert Downey Jr. was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
9,BA_Harrison,"Difficult to follow thriller, full of Black humour.",6,18 April 2006,"Shane Black is a fine writer and his screenplays for Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, and The Long Kiss Goodnight bristled with witty dialogue, great characters and deftly handled action scenes. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, his directorial debut, also shares these attributes, but suffers from a convoluted plot and a script so overloaded with witticisms and clever asides that the viewer soon feels overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the experience.Robert Downey Jr. plays a low-life criminal who inadvertently becomes a potential movie star whilst escaping from a heist gone wrong (on the run, he stumbles into an audition and gets the part). However, things take a turn for the worse when he goes undercover as a private-eye (in order to gain first hand experience necessary for the role) and witnesses a murder...Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is an ambitious debut  several complex plot threads intertwine and an ingenious narrative links scenes - but despite his best efforts, Black loses control of affairs and the film spirals out of control. Despite my best efforts at keeping up, I just couldn't follow the storyline. It doesn't help matters that half of the lines are spoken in a chaotic scattershot manner and the other half are mumbled, making staying abreast of the story nigh on impossible at times. There are probably many moments of pure genius in Shane Black's script - it's a shame that I missed a lot of them.The parts of the film that I did manage to follow and understand are actually very good. Kilmer and Downey Jr. work well together and share some incredibly funny scenes, there are some genuine 'classic' moments (Downey pissing on the corpse in the shower is hilarious) and the manner in which the story unfolds is, at times, inspired. If Black hadn't been trying so damn hard to be so clever with his words and had concentrated more on telling the story, this may have been a real gem.Although the film closes with all loose ends neatly tied up, I suffered the majority of the running time baffled by proceedings and struggled to keep up with the sharp prose that flows thick and fast from the word go.Maybe this is one of those films that would benefit from an immediate second viewing in order to catch all the bits I missed first time round.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
10,blanche-2,Wild and crazy film,7,6 September 2009,"""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a fast-moving, often witty mystery starring Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Corbin Bernsen, and Michelle Monaghan. Directed and co-written by Shane Black, it's set in the glitz of L.A. and has features of an old noir and ""Chinatown."" The premise is excellent. Robert Downey Jr. plays a thief who, while on the run from the cops, stumbles into a film audition. From there, he winds up at a ritzy Hollywood party and taking ""detective lessons"" from a gay investigator (Kilmer). It's a short walk from the lessons to finding a dead body that keeps moving around, taking a case himself, getting involved with a girl he knew as a kid, and continually losing his finger.Downey serves as the narrator, and frankly, I don't think I've ever seen a film that moved so dazzlingly fast - and had such a convoluted plot. It's really a case of style over substance, and there it succeeds very well. There are some hilarious lines and situations, as well as a lot of shooting.The very end is a touch on the lame side, but it really doesn't spoil the experience of the film or its very good performances. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is very slickly made and, while paying homage to pulp novels, manages to put a modern spin on an old genre.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
11,Quinoa1984,"a witty, self-conscious send-up of detective noir, a big plus being Downey Jr",9,16 March 2008,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is meant to be Shane Black's comeback following a decade spent in the action-movie desert (albeit only a creative one, he financially has nothing to cry about), and it's not a bad way to resurface on the Hollywood scene. For one thing, his film is clever- maybe too clever by half but clever all the same- as it sends up conventions of movies like these, as sometimes a scene will freeze and the frame will go up and reverberating out back to where it started, as Robert Downey Jr's Harry comments on how stupid this or that is in the movies this or that happens. On top of this, having dipped more than a toe into Raymond Chandler, he divides up the picture into chapters and the plot itself becomes less important as it rolls along than the dialog and the fun in playing with what to expect with the characters.Some of this was previously seen to something of a more annoying degree in Last Action Hero, only this time his wild card, paying off in spades, is the cast, chiefly Downey Jr. Downey Jr appears almost similarly in many of the parts he's played in the past years, only not quite all the time. He's predicably unpredictable, or vice versa, and you want to keep watching him with his sly, cunning, awkward, disturbing characters. As the character who ""we"" (the audience) identifies with here, Harry is quite a character. His pathetic and ignorant qualities add a nice humanism to him as the Shamus-in-training in this story, as a thief who literally stumbles on an audition and gets a screentest out to Hollywood. This is where, for a lack of a better word, contrivance springs out, as Harry meets ""Gay Perry"" (also very good Val Kilmer), a private dick who advises movie crews, and Haroney (Michelle Monaghan), who Harry knew back when they were kids.Soon a murder mystery unravels involving a woman in a trunk of a car driven out to the bottom of a lake. Was it murder, or suicide? Who are the culprits behind all the other shady things going on? A lot of this, as Black unfolds it all, doesn't seem to matter that much, which is just as well. Black's attitude is to keep things moving at such a post-modernist clip it threatens to spill the rest of the movie off course. But the cast, as mentioned, keeps things sort of in check, particularly with Downey and Kilmers' ability to play off each other and Downey and Monaghan's ridiculous chemistry. What matters here are the little moments, the things that pop out from behavior and chance in the scenes (one critic commented a kinship to Altman, which I don't totally see but can appreciate via the Long Goodbye), like when a character gets one in the head on a Russian Roulette lark. That pesky finger is also quite a silly aside, if only for its lack of significance where there should be plenty.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a lot of fun for knowing what it is and rolling along like a well-oiled machine, despite the plot being as flimsy as one of the pulp fictions from the books Haromy loves so from her youth.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
12,edwagreen,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang-Kiss this One Good Bye 0*,1,18 October 2006,"Absolutely dreadful film.At the end of the film, you will definitely ask yourself what this film is all about. You will not be able to answer this as well.I realize that Robert Downey Jr. has had a tough life doing drugs. Must he submit to scripts such as this one? It's enough for him to revert back to his old habits.In it, a guy running from the police comes into an audition like situation for a part. He reads the part brilliantly and is immediately confused for a Marlon Brando-method-like acting person.After that, it's off to Hollywood parties with plenty of shooting, chase sequences and other nonsense galore.What's going on here?

13,michaelRokeefe,Queer private eye and a straight guy.,7,16 December 2006,"Flippant, smug and a times pretty hilarious. If you like satire and slapstick comedy with your reckless gun play...KISS KISS BANG BANG is the film for you. A convoluted murder mystery that holds interest. Harry Lockhart(Robert Downey Jr.)is a bad actor/petty thief that thinks he's going to be in a movie playing a private eye. He gets some lessons from 'Gay Perry'(Val Kilmer), the tough acting gay private dick. In a chance meeting, Harry reunites with his childhood sweetheart and struggling actress Harmony Faith(Michelle Monaghan). The three get involved with a bizarre murder investigation; all the while dodging bullets and death threats.My favorite scenes involve Harry: one where he looks up a dead girls dress; and when a dog eats his already dismembered finger.

15,hitchcockthelegend,"It's literally like someone took America by the East Coast and shook it, and all the normal girls managed to hang on.",9,29 November 2013,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is written and directed by Shane Black. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Michael Barrett. Small time thief Harry Lockhart (Downey Jr.) is running from the police and stumbles into a movie audition and gets the part! Partnered with private detective Gay Perry (Kilmer), who is to show him the ropes for the part he's to play, things turn just a little weird when dead bodies start turning up in his life Shane Black's first venture into big feature film directing is a master class of genre bending bravado. The screenplay and script bare all the hallmarks of Black, where anyone familiar with his writing work previously will know where to set expectation levels as per barbed dialogue and blitzkrieg energy. Yet this is very much one of a kind, a standalone of such dizzying thrills and shameless awareness of movie conventions, it practically begs to be visited on more than one occasion. To simplify it, it's a neo-noir – murder mystery – bromance – romance – comedy – actioner! OK, so not really that simple, then! Black takes a loving homage to pulp cinema and mixes it with caustic asides to the Los Angeles industry that provides him with work. How wonderful. Downey's (fabulous) Lockhart is the fulcrum, acting as antagonist, protagonist, narrator and a number of other things as Black runs him through the meta mangler. Kilmer (also fabulous) sidles up to deliver sarcasm, machismo and tongue in cheek posturing, the chemistry with Downey concrete. An odd couple pairing beautifully baring fruit, and, well, just beautiful really. Into the mix is the gorgeous Monaghan, who as Harry's childhood object of affection, is now a failed actress, slightly damaged, but strong and savvy, but also not, an unconditional femme fatale, but also not really! Corbin Bernsen (whose company produced the pic) files in for some joy filled has-been smarm, while sound tracking and photography sit comfortably with the nature of the beast. As a plot it's deliberately complex and convoluted, Black knows his noir onions, but he also wants to put his vibrant stamp on things, so he crowbars the comedy of The Hard Way into the hardboiled haze of The Big Sleep. And it works very well indeed. Violence is aplenty but very much irreverently played. Murders occur, either by design or otherwise, various body parts get assaulted and they shouldn't make for belly laughs, but they do; and not in some lame Weekend at Bernie's way either. And yet still Black has time to trickle sad themes below the surface, one in particular really hits home and forces the viewer to snap out of the frivolity for some reflection. Make no bones about it, these are damaged characters straight out of noir's dark alleyways in the 40s and 50s. So Capra meets Siodmak - Dmytryk - Mann - Tourneur - Wilder...then? Smarty pants film making makes for smart entertainment, see it more than once. Hell! See it annually in fact. 9/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
16,jotix100,Calling Johnny Gossamer to action,10,2 December 2005,"The immensely likable novel ""Bodies are where you find them"", written by Brett Halliday, has been adapted for the screen by Shane Black and the result is one of the funniest movies playing around. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" boasts an amazing dialog with some of the wittiest lines of any film in recent memory.The film pays a tremendous bonus to fans of the genre, which combines a detective story technique with some amusement and irony thrown in.

There are definitely some flashes of wit throughout, although the script isn't always terribly funny. Some of the gags are entirely obvious (such as when Black and Downey Jr. break the fourth wall and make fun of the conventions and clichés of filmmaking), but they still generate some chuckles. The script also works in digs at the way English speaking people don't always use the proper grammar. The banter between our two leads is consistent, and Black gives his movie some good pacing, and the widescreen photography is just right.There is a solid cast at work here; besides Bernsen and the lovely Monaghan, we have the comedian Larry Miller, Dash Mihok and Rockmond Dunbar as a pair of goons named ""Frying Pan"" and ""Fire"", and the cute Shannyn Sossamon.

Also the movie is broken up into four days (I think) and each day is ""named"" with a title from a Raymond Chandler novel. This isn't cute or amusing...just stupid. The plot is also VERY convoluted--it's almost impossible to follow at times. And there's virtual non-stop swearing. And I got pretty disgusted with scenes of gruesome violence played for laughs.I stayed with the movie for a few reasons--Downey was superb (and narrates the entire film); Kilmer very nicely underplays his role and the dialogue IS sharp and good.

We get meta jokes, where what is going to happen is literally described - and derided as predictable - at times immediately prior to it occurring(this has a subversive mix of that which you completely expect, and things you couldn't image would happen... both surprise you). The snappy pace(the 94 and a half minutes sans credits, or 98 and a half minutes with, fly by) means that you just exactly realize something as it happens... even when it is, intentionally, clichéd. It's sarcastic and knows what it is, hip, clever(the fast-talking dialog is incredible, sometimes wordy and full of itself), and full of twists and turns(the script is tight throughout). And it's so packed that it rewards rewatching. The DVD comes with an interesting and amusing commentary track with Val, Robert and writer/director(his debut as the latter, impressive!) Shane Black, a funny 4 and a half minute gag reel and a theatrical trailer. There is a lot of strong language and bloody violence(this is gratuitous in many ways), a bit of sexuality/nudity(topless female), and a little disturbing content(the opening will stick in your mind...!) in this. I recommend this to fans of murder mystery(especially those who, like this, realize that those are primarily about the characters and their relationships) and fiction, both as enjoying taking them in, and pondering how they tend to be presented. 8/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

24,george.schmidt,Back in Black! Shane Black is back in a big way; Downey & Kilmer rock hard & Monaghan sizzles!,9,24 October 2005,"KISS KISS, BANG BANG (2005) ***1/2 Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan, Corbin Bernsen, Dash Mihok, Larry Miller, Rockmond Dunbar, Shannyn Sossamon, Angela Lindvall.Back in Black!Shane Black is back in a big way. If you don't know who Shane Black is let his credits as a hot-shot screenwriter speak for themselves : ""Lethal Weapon"", ""The Last Boy Scout"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"", ""Last Action Hero"" (ok the last one may be the reason we haven't really heard much from him in over 7 years!) A gifted scribe of tough, snarky dialogued action flix usually produced with hyperbolic overkill by Joel Silver with huge box office boffo. Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (i.e. he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly. If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production. This sure as hell ain't.Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'. But since he's on Shaw's permanent payroll he has no choice.Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart. Harry's unrequited love for Harmony is re-ignited and soon finds himself (and Perry) embroiled in a murder case when one of Perry's employer's daughters winds up killed. The odd couple begrudgingly decides to follow through on some seedy leads and soon wind up to their necks in dead bodies and hot water. Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto. The two leads are funny, fast-witted  like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory. Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin  street smarts and flair to spare. Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt. Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills). Fast, fleet footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
25,neil-476,Very good noir crime thriller with humour,8,4 May 2009,"The humour in this film shouldn't work - it sits side by side with real violence, real death, real jeopardy. The protagonists could genuinely be killed at any time. And, since this isn't remotely funny, the wisecracking dialogue shouldn't be funny either.But it is.Downey's ongoing narrative to the audience - not so much breaking down the fourth wall as demolishing it - shouldn't work either. Right from the start it references the fact that the audience are simply watching a film, even to the extent of stopping the action with a stationary frame line halfway across the screen, and this wilful calling attention to the artifice of cinema should wholly prevent the suspension of disbelief. The device shouldn't work.But it does.The plot is fine - suitably labyrinthine without ever being too difficult to follow. The characters are all fun. The actors playing them are all excellent, and the performances are good (and Michelle Monaghan looks great in - and out of - a fur-trimmed Santa minidress). And, while all this shouldn't work in the framework of the humour and wall-breaking voice-over, it does.I could have done without the bad language which, I felt, was broadly unnecessary.A most enjoyable movie.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
26,evanston_dad,"A Great Vehicle for Robert Downey, Jr.",8,1 December 2006,"Robert Downey, Jr. gives a loose, hip and extremely likable performance in this loose, hip and extremely likable comedy thriller.Downey, Jr. may not be able to manage his personal life worth a damn, but he does manage to show unerring instincts in picking good movies, and he's frequently one of the best things about whatever movie he happens to be in. In ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" he plays Harry, a petty thief who ends up in L.A. on a fluke auditioning for a part as a private detective in a movie. Fiction begins to blur into reality when he gets caught up in a murder plot and must do some real-life detective work of his own with the help of Gay Perry, a Hollywood agent and odd-jobber (Val Kilmer) and his childhood friend, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), who he meets up with by chance. The plot is fast and twisted; we frequently can see no further ahead than the characters and so share the same emotions they do when the next development comes along.The writers of this film have fashioned a quick-witted screenplay full of throw-away zingers and outrageous scenarios that they, along with the actors and direction, help to make work. Keep a sharp eye while watching this film; tiny little details of plot or even of the production design recur later, sometimes in important ways, sometimes as no more than inside jokes. And even that most dreaded of film conventions, the voice over narration, that usually makes me cringe, works very well here, mostly due to Downey, Jr.'s hilarious delivery of it.So....a fast-paced, funny and off-beat film with don't-sweat-it performances and a solid script.

27,ferguson-6,Captain Magic and My Friend Flicka,9,11 November 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. Definitely not a film for everyone, but without question, I laughed outloud more during this movie than I have in years. There are numerous labels one could bestow on KKBB: murder mystery, comedy, drama, thriller, action and more. One could say it is a spoof of or tribute to film noir and Raymond Chandler pulp detective novels or even a buddy flick. The point is, it doesn't matter what it is because it is just plain entertaining.First time director Shane Black explodes back on the screen after his self-imposed asylum. Black reached the pinnacle of his career as a screenwriter for films such as the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, ""The Last Boy Scout"" and the underrated ""The Long Kiss Goodbye"". Then he walked away. He resurrects his career with this amazingly creative ""little"" film. His trademark snappy dialog is better than ever and there are plenty of ""cool or stylish"" moments and a wonderful little murder mystery wrapped around a sorta-love story.Casting of Val Kilmer initially seemed like a bad call, but the talented bad boy shines as an openly gay private detective who is hired to teach an actor how to be a PI. The accidental actor/petty thief is played brilliantly by Robert Downey, Jr. What a shame that Downey has not been able to stay clean in real life because he is truly a unique talent, pure magic on screen. The third and every bit as impressive lead actor is Michelle Monaghan (""North Country"" ""Boston Public""). MM has wonderful screen presence and is poised for stardom. Such energy! Expect to see her a great deal over the next few years (that's a good thing!).Did I mention multiple corpses, a severed finger, a hungry dog, a body (or two) in the trunk, mean bad guys, false trails, etc etc? This one has it all ... even Elvis and Lincoln and hilarious narration by Downey. Also, young Harry is played by Downey's real life son and Downey himself sings the song playing over the closing credits.You should watch this one with an open mind and LISTEN to the dialog. If someone around you is yakking in the theater, get up and move. The dialog will keep you involved and laughing. Kilmer can't quite keep up with Downey's pace, but few could!!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
28,gradyharp,Parodies and Pitfalls,5,16 June 2006,"Shane Black is a hard driving propulsive director who seems to value speed highly. In some films it works: In KISS KISS BANG BANG the result is just a silly, self-absorbed 'in joke' that quickly wears out its welcome.Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, looking a bit long in the tooth) escapes his career in minor petty crime in New York and flees to Los Angeles where he serendipitously lands in an acting studio tryout and is picked up as a method actor for a part in a crime movie. He is assigned to Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) who is to train him in matters detective, but instead ends up in a crime investigation that involves a lot of unfocused characters and corpses and Lockhart's old high school sweetheart Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan). The plot is convoluted to say the least and it is made more annoying by the technique of voice over by Downey's character that flash forwards, static pauses, and flash backs in an amateurish way that begins as funny and rapidly becomes irritating. The film seems to be a parody of the genre and as so often can happen in parody, unless it is sensitively written, it becomes too infatuated with itself to make us care about anyone or any event.Downey, Kilmer, and Monaghan give it their best and it is good to see Downey back on the screen: he is a gifted actor after all. The saving grace of the film is thanks to cinematographer Michael Barrett who shows us a Los Angeles of spectacular beauty. But in the end Shane Blake shows us that trying to be ever so clever can result is a sort of a mess. And if you can make it through this film and watch the Gag Role featurette, you'll see the reason the film got so off track: 'in jokes' that are so 'in' fail to be entertaining.

29,The_Void,"Not entirely successful, but nevertheless an interesting film",7,7 February 2006,"I'm not sure whether or not I like this film. On the one hand, I enjoyed watching it and I respect the fact that it's tried to be a little different; but on the other hand, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang reminds me too much of the guy at the buffet who fills his plate and doesn't end up eating it all. The film is a comedy, a thriller, a murder mystery, an action flick; a character study and a crime film, all rolled into one. It would be hard for any film to take this cocktail and spin it into a coherent piece, but to it's credit; Kiss Kiss Bang Bang almost succeeds; but cracks begin to show where the story is concerned, as the film clearly makes the conglomeration of genres it's central point, and it's too easy to get confused. The film is based on a collection of stories by Brett Halliday, and it follows a petty thief who stumbles into the top flight of Hollywood by chance, and soon finds himself part of a murder investigation after witnessing a car speeding into a lake. The investigation includes a gay detective named 'Gay Perry', and his former childhood sweetheart, Harmony.The cast is one of the film's main assets. Director Shane Black is always happy to show off his main star, who has finally made his way back into 'A' class movies after some...errr...time out. Downey is a talented actor, and it's through him that the film gains most of its vitality. He is joined by Val Kilmer, who is a lot better than I thought he would be in the role of the gay detective. Michelle Monaghan rounds off the cast, and holds her own against the two bigger name male leads. Shane Black is most famous for his action films, including credits for the Lethal Weapon series and Arnie vehicle; The Last Action Hero, but like the film's main lead; Black has had some time off recently, and this film marks his comeback. Some people were relieved to see the Predator co-star back in action...I cant say I share the sentiment, but all in all; I'm glad that he has finally made his directorial debut with this film. On the whole, this will appeal to people who like their films to be quirky and offbeat. The mock-noir style bodes well with Downey's witty performance, and the film is constantly entertaining; even if it doesn't always hit the mark dead on.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

The movie finds ideal casting in both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer (unlikely actor and private eye, respectively) and their bitchy chemistry makes this clock tick. Well that, and Downey's smug narration. The banter in this thing is unbelievable.But in the end, this is a Shane Black movie, and the guy's got a gift for dialogue; rapid-fire, crackling, yet smoother than single malt.

But I have got to admit, this man is truly talented. But it really wasn't just the actors that makes this film awesome, it was the story. I'm going to be honest, I'm still not too sure on how the sister died because it seemed like the story just kept on changing it's mind.

35,MovieAddict2016,Black Is Back.,10,5 July 2006,"You've gotta hand it to Shane Black. This is the man who helped create the cop-buddy genre with ""Lethal Weapon,"" then turned around four years later and satirized it with his script for ""The Last Boy Scout."" A lot of critics didn't like that movie because it was loud, ugly, profane, garish and Tony Scott-ish. But a lot of them simply didn't understand it.Ditto for ""Last Action Hero."" It's one of the most daring and original Hollywood films ever produced, and yet somehow many of its stars didn't even appreciate it. Arnold signed on thinking it was just another action flick with some tongue-in-cheek humor (as evidenced by his later comments about the film being ""too violent"" for kids). But that movie had a lot of brains, and it consistently made fun of the high level of cartoonish violence in any Arnie movie. And when ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" rolled around, that is when Black proved once and for all that although his films may contain a surface of male machismo, misogyny, over-the-top violence and profanity, it's his clever writing that always undermines what's happening in the forefront. He's serving Hollywood exactly what they want, while still managing to take jabs at them underneath it all. He took the whole spy-thriller genre for a big twist, but once again a lot of people just didn't ""get it""  and it was another bomb. It shoved him into unwilling retirement.Now, Shane is black with his directorial debut, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,"" one of the best films I've ever seen. Entertaining from frame one, this gritty, smug little film carries over a lot of the unadulterated heavy violence and sexism inherent in so many action films from the 1980s and early 1990s. But it's all poking fun at itself, in typical Shane fashion. Take the scene where the heroine, Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan), runs around a Los Angeles park in a skimpy Playboy outfit, for example. Shane even gives her a gun. Kiss kiss, bang bang.Robert Downey, Jr. plays Harry Lockhart, a small-time crook from the east coast who gets his partner killed in a toy store robbery and, on the run from cops, stumbles into an open casting audition. He breaks down in an emotional fit in front of the casting director, who thinks it's the best performance he's ever seen. He flies Harry out to LA to prepare for his role in the film, where he meets Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), a gay Hollywood insider who is a private eye of sorts and is also gay. Did I mention he's gay? Because it's made clear that he is. A lot. And in case you didn't get it the first time, they even gave him a Gay nickname. Literally.But that's the genius of this movie. Kilmer embodies Perry so well that he ends up transforming his character into a giant criticism of gay stereotypes. Perry is a stereotype who is aware of his stereotypes, and embraces them, and makes fun of them - and isn't afraid too, which makes it acceptable for us to laugh. Perry is even, to a point, another means to satirize Black's earlier material. Riggs and Murtaugh solidified the idea of buddies in a buddy-movie  what they should be like, how they should interact, and so on and so forth. To suddenly have a buddy movie with a straight character and a gay character almost seems to be breaking the unwritten Buddy Movie laws that Black helped create. Perry is one of Kilmer's best and most likable performances, and he plays right into the hands of the wonderful Robert Downey Jr., who is a true revelation. His comedic timing and fourth wall narrative are flawless. His interaction with Kilmer is classic, and one of the best buddy-pairings since ""Lethal Weapon."" Go figure. It almost makes you crave for a sequel, even though you really don't want to risk them ruining the originality of the original.""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" is the most obvious of all Shane's self-referential films, because it speaks directly to its audience. (""I saw the last Lord of the Rings, I'm not going to have like seventeen different endings."") But balancing a self-referential narrative in a film like this almost seems a risky thing to do in the post-Tarantino era  the era in which self-reference became ""hip"" and ""cool,"" but most importantly: financially profitable for the studios. The production companies dished them out and soon the entire concept was burnt out and boring. The smug, self-aware attitude of flicks like ""Boondock Saints"" became tiresome. But it's only fitting that the father of the genre should be the one to resurrect it.This film has the best dialogue I've heard in a movie for ages, and the brilliance of it is the fact that it doesn't become overbearingly self-conscious: it's amiable and entertaining. The film's title is a reference to another movie, by the way. Pauline Kael supposedly saw the term in Italy, where it was used to describe the James Bond character. It effectively sums up exactly what Hollywood wants in their movies  girls, sex, violence. Kiss kiss, bang bang. Black is back.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
36,KineticSeoul,Funny and edgy neo-noir black comedy,8,16 January 2017,"I remember renting this movie when it first came out on DVD. And thought of it as a funny and cleverly executed movie that I wanted to watch again later on. It isn't as amazing as I remember it to be but it's still a very clever black comedy with heavily flawed but likable characters. It's a neo-noir film that has a more fast placed and edgy feel to it all. Although the biggest payoff and fame came from Robert Downey, Jr. playing Tony Stark. This is the role I remember Downey the most from. It's difficult to play a thief that is all talk and lack common sense and yet still very likable. But Downey managed to pull it off thanks to his acting chops and because of the writing. And probably his character is someone that can resonate with a lot of people. This is also Val Kilmer's 3rd most memorable role for me. He was just excellent as an overly sarcastic and somewhat pompous private investigator. And what drives this movie is the interactions and banters between these two characters. Overall I thoroughly still enjoyed this film and will probably watch it again in a few years...Maybe.8.5/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
37,Buddy-51,clever but not as fun as it could have been,6,3 August 2006,"As its title suggests, """"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a film noir spoof whose energy and style compensate for its overall dearth of laughs.The highly complicated plot begins when Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.), a petty thief living in Manhattan, literally stumbles into a movie acting career while fleeing the police on a heist gone wrong. Before he knows what's happened, he's standing by a pool in Hollywood surrounded by a slew of movie-making hotshots and wannabe starlets including Val Kilmer as a gay private eye and Michelle Monaghan an aspiring actress who also happens to be a childhood chum from Harry's days growing up in Indiana. Then, as if he had suddenly fallen into one of those dime store crime novels, Harry finds himself plunged into a dark mystery involving not one but two unexplained murders.Writer/director Shane Blake has a great time lampooning not merely the conventions of film noir and Chandler-esquire pulp fiction - the convoluted plotting, the self-conscious dialogue, the smart-alecky narration and the casual popgun violence - but Tinsel Town phoniness as well. In both storyline and style, the film often blurs the fine line separating mundane ""reality"" from the contrivances and absurdities of movie fiction, most notably by having Harry frequently address the audience directly in his narration.There's no denying that ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a high energy lark, filled with creativity and imagination and featuring sharp performances from Downey Jr., Kilmer, Monaghan and a whole host of excellent supporting players. The problem with the film, though, is that for all its cleverness, it really just isn't as witty as it should be. Although we can sense what it is we're supposed to be finding humorous, for some reason the laughs just never seem to come with any great regularity. Too often the humor feels forced and strained so that at best the movie elicits a chuckle here or there instead of a series of full-throated guffaws.Still, this is a fast-paced, clever, if not particularly memorable film that captures the quintessence of L.A.-derived fiction.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
38,thesar-2,L.A. Confessional,9,24 January 2016,"Looks like I got another fantastic Christmas movie to add to my annual holiday viewings. Just too bad I saw it a month (or a decade) late.Funny about this movie, for me anyways: this is my third and final attempt to watch it a first time. Years ago, I started and stopped 20 minutes in. I wasn't a fan of Val Kilmer and it was before I really started to appreciate Robert Downey Jr. So, unbelievably, I was put off by this movie and never thought I would pick up this ""novel"" of a film again. That is, until a friend recommended it to me and I've been hearing others mention it with positive words.Ah, but there's two more attempts. Last night, I watched about 90% of it before passing out – one should never watch this under the influence. Case in point: I got so lost, thought it was too crazy and, well, I didn't have much choice but to sleep with only 10% remaining. Today: instead of picking back up at the climax, I rewound (if us old-timers can still call it that) it and began at the beginning for the third time.That really helped. Well, that and the lack of booze. I already really liked the dialogue – finding myself laughing out loud and marveling at Downey Jr.'s awesome wit/timing – but, now I could follow the mystery from all the clues I might have even missed sober.What an incredible little gem. It is a travesty that this movie BARELY made its money back and that would have to include its worldwide box- office receipts. Maybe it was too confusing for some – like my second, albeit further along, attempt. I dunno. This movie is amazing.Downey Jr.'s smalltime crook Harry inadvertently gets thrown into an L.A. story of intrigue where he reunites with an old flame (or dame? well, since this is basically film noir) and teams with his obviously first gay human being he's ever met, appropriately, a private dick, to solve multiple murders and survive themselves.What sounds like the typical mystery, and believe me, if they stopped there, it'd still be great, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang really delivered on the humor, fantastic witticisms and chemistry between the leads. Like I previously mentioned, I didn't used to be a Kilmer fan, but seeing him in the MacGruber movie a couple of years back, I started to rethink my opinion of him. And he was pretty good himself. Downey Jr., of course and as usual, stole every scene. Not complaining, I loved them both here.The surprise for me was the always lovely, drop-dead gorgeous and talented Michelle Monaghan. I first discovered her in Mission: Impossible III and loved her. Not into girls, but dang she is hot. Then, I was happy she was in the incredible Source Code, which was already a great movie, and she only helped propel it. I wish I'd see more of her and because I like her so much, she is forgiven for Pixels. Only her – the rest of that crap cast's obviously is going to hell.I digress. I really loved this movie. It needs to be seen by more people. Especially those who jumped on the Downey Jr. Iron Man bandwagon. Here's a tip: he was already wonderful before he Avenged the world. SEE: Wonder Boys. This too. See this too, but also Wonder Boys. Okay, see all his works. He's just as amazing as this movie. ***Final thoughts: Half-way through attempt two of this film, I was reminded by one of my all-time favorite movies: L.A. Confidential and was shocked to learn I didn't own it on Blu. So, naturally, I had to pause this and buy it through Amazon. By that point, I didn't love this movie, or I certainly would've purchased this one, as well. Maybe when L.A.

Divided into chapters titled after Raymond Chandler novels, the film follows petty criminal turned aspiring actor Downey as he gets involved with a witty detective (excellently played by Kilmer) and a sexy actress (Monaghan).Downey is a bit of a sad sack into the movie, clueless and rash, and while his performance is quite different, it reminded me a bit of Bob Hope film noir take-offs. The movie often mocks film conventions, most notably with Downey's sloppy narration, and while it is sometimes overly gimmicky, I generally thought it worked.Unlike those old Hope movies, KKBB takes its noir seriously. The plot is complex and moves fast but actually holds up much better than Chandler's often incomprehensible stories, and the action and suspense are very well done, both exciting and funny. The film takes the noir conventions it likes but tosses the ones that seem archaic; in a 40s movie Monaghan would have been a mysterious femme fatale, but here she's more an action- hero version of Nancy Drew.I'm kind of torn between giving this movie a 7 and an 8. I really like it, but somehow I never quite *loved* it, perhaps because the gimmicky stuff distances you from the visceral stuff. But it's really enjoyable and I highly recommend it.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
40,Robert_duder,"A DARK, DARK comedy about murder, love and other stuff",7,1 July 2006,"I don't know what expectations I had from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I didn't know what kind of film it was going to be, I hadn't even seen a trailer so it was all new and it didn't fail to impress. I will say that the plot confused me a little at times and I'm still not exactly sure how everything came about but the performances and wit of the script are good enough that it doesn't really matter. The real brilliance with the film is the dark comedy. The sheer satire and sarcasm that drips throughout the screenplay. It's funny enough that you'll laugh out loud but doesn't overtake the dark foreboding tone of Hollywood and the murders that are happening.Robert Downey Jr. plays thief turned actor turned Private Eye Harry Lockhart. Due to a series of misunderstandings he ends up doing each part and getting involved in a murder scheme involving the sister of a former high school lover interest. Downey Jr. plays sarcasm and the underdog perfectly. Although usually I find his performances drab and low key this is exactly what the character of Harry Lockhart needed. He is perfect for this role even if it is his shortcomings that makes him perfect. The character is neurotic, sarcastic and fun for those reasons. Val Kilmer has picked some rather low key roles lately but still does a terrific job. In this film he plays Gay Perry, a private detective, unknowingly hired by a woman to film her own suicide but looks like a murder. His role is even more sarcastic and his lines are hilarious. It's not like outright comedy but subtle funny lines that made me laugh out loud. It was a subtle role but he did a terrific job and although I don't think the character was REALLY outstanding I'm surprised he didn't get far more critical acclaim out of it. The beautiful Michelle Monaghan plays Harmony Faith Lane, an aspiring actress who tends to be a bit manipulative when it comes to poor Harry's feelings for her. She gets herself deeply involved with her sister's murder/suicide and tries to help but it usually ends badly, especially for Harry. Her chemistry with Downey Jr. is good, although not terrific. She fit Tom Cruise better in MI:3. Still she is a worthy addition to the cast.For a comedy of this caliber of dark satire the cast really needs to work together and thus lies the one major problem of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. The cast is good together but not outstanding. Either by script or direction the cast never really melds together as strongly as you might hope. It's meant to be sort of a buddy cop type action film and it never really makes it to that point. They form a small bond but never really get off the ground with it. Still the script is well written and the comedy is very witty and it's a fast paced film with a fair amount of action. You really have to pay attention for this plot because it's actually pretty complicated at times and I can see that critics would really enjoy this murder mystery. It's an absolute film noir so if that's your thing absolutely check this one out!! 7/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

It frantically tries to be a non-stop ride of clever in-jokes and wittiness, sometimes it pulls it off (a scene where Downey Jr. and the leading female character sit in a bar and poke fun at celebrity 'lookalikes' is one example) but at other times the film can get a little too smart for it's own good and can grate on the nerves.In the leading roles, Kilmer gives a better performance than usual but Downey Jr. shows a bit of Nicolas Cage syndrome and has no doubt thrown a lot of his own real life crazy personality into this role. ***",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
42,paul2001sw-1,Self-satire,6,10 November 2012,"Comedy noir is a rare genre, and a difficult to pull off well. Shane Black's film 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', a tale of a hapless petty criminal who finds himself involved in a Chandleresque tale of murder and double dealing hits some of the right notes, but ultimately fails not because of the (frankly ordinary, but somewhat funny) comedy but rather because the front of comic absurdity undermines the underlying thriller: it's hard to care about the story, even though the plot itself is quite sharp. It's fast moving and lively, but ultimately, as its flippant title itself suggests, it's just a little too knowing, a satire that ends up satirsing itself.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

It's well-done comedy, several laugh-out-loud moments punctuate a consistently well-written screenplay, but it can feel a little cynical, at times, and the overly complex plot is occasionally difficult to follow. The way the feature plays around with the fourth wall can get a little 'in your face' in the first forty minutes, too. However, this is still an energetic and entertaining feature that brings Black back to his former self, sitting side-by-side with 'Lethal Weapon (1987)' as an engagingly smart action-comedy.

44,bowmanblue,Downey Jr without the iron suit,8,14 May 2019,"I'm guessing 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' must have developed a 'cult following' by now. Whenever I ask people have they seen it, they just give me a blank look as if I'm making the film's title up! If nothing else it stars 'Iron Man' himself (Robert Downey Jr) and also 'Batman' (Val Kilmer, but I daresay most of us will have wiped his turn under the cape and cowl from our collective minds). Downey Jr was probably never meant to be the 'face' of Marvel's 'shared universe' and yet his sheer charisma propelled him to deserved mega-stardom. Here (back in 2005), he simply practices all those traits that would eventually make Tony Stark such a compelling character.It's hard to imagine Robert Downey Jr not flying (literally!) headlong into the thick of the action in order to save a city from an alien menace, however, here, he plays Harry Lockhart who is a simple thief (and not a particularly good one!) who inadvertently gets mistaken for an actor and subsequently finds himself auditioning for roles in L.A. Now, as if that wasn't unexpected enough for him, he also gets caught up in a double murder mystery and requires the help of Gay Perry (private detective, Val Kilmer) and flame-from-the-past Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan) in order to solve it.In short, if you're a fan of Downey Jr's work (or rather Tony Stark with a different name) then you'll love 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' totally and I could leave the review there, but for those who may require a little more convincing, I should say that the banter between Downey Jr and Val Kilmer is right up there with any he's done with Captain America, Thor or the Hulk. Kilmer himself deserves a nod for his portrayal of - openly gay - private detective Gay Perry (did the name not tip you off?), going some way to dispel typical gay stereotypes in major filmic productions. Also, Michelle Monaghan is more than just 'eye candy' - her character isn't a 'Mary Sue' and, besides looking damn fine, actually has relevance in the plot and gives as good as she gets with (her obvious 'love interest') Downey Jr.Personally, I loved this film and the cheeky pokes it takes at Hollywood films in general, going some way to break a few of the tropes and clichés associated with the genre. I'm not sure if this is a fault or just an observation, but since 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' was released we're probably all more familiar with 'Deadpool.' The reason I mention this is because this other superhero is well-known for 'breaking the fourth wall' and talking directly to us, the audience. 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' also uses this technique, but mainly at the beginning and the end of the film. It was as if the film-makers liked it, but then ran out of ways to incorporate Downey Jr (also our narrator and story-teller) turning to face camera and making wry observations. Then, when the film was wrapping up, they realised they better put a few more of these instances in.However, that doesn't really bring the film down. If you're into banter-filled murder mysteries with an A-list cast then this should certainly be something you should check out. Hopefully, since Downey Jr's rise to fame more people will have checked out this little gem by now.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Harry tells the story in flashback in what he hopes is the confidential manner of the pulp-fiction writers he has loved since childhood. And he frequently freezes, replays and comments on bits of the action. It sounds somewhat contrived, yet Downey Jr carries it off, though perhaps because he gives no sign of taking it seriously. His ability to make mischief and act at the same time may seem paradoxical, but both involve his gift for having you conspire with him on the entirely valid assumption that you're going to have a good time however things turn out.

52,johnnyboyz,"Fun, action packed, post-modern and deliberately out to mess with clichés; a real winner.",8,4 February 2008,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a film that not only references, messes about with and updates typical codes and conventions we've come to expect in films but even its title is a steal from something to do with James Bond in the 1960s. The level of energy, parody and humour apparent in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is so evident; so entertaining and so vibrant in its delivery that to miss out on that alone would be a great shame. Shane Black comes across as a sort of cousin to Tarantino; his love of films and his love of a genre all surge to the surface in this film; an homage, an update and a parody of all things noir.I think Kiss Kiss Bang Bang comes off a sort of hybrid; a hybrid of The Maltese Falcon and Fight Club; two films that have for one reason or another gone down as genuinely great films thanks to certain audiences or delivery or whatever. But whilst Kiss Kiss Bang Bang seems like a mesh of these two titles; it comes off as refreshing at the same time, what with its zany transitions, self-aware narration and relatively fast edits. Along with this, you have just about every noir archetype fans of the genre will have become accustomed to floating in and out of the picture. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a film that just resembles a post-modern explosion what with its toying of genres, codes and conventions; its messing around with obligatory scenes and its narrator circling things on screen whilst telling other characters in the film to budge out of the way. But the film is much more than a bunch of mere cheap gimmicks and respects its subject matter along the way. I suppose in noirs of old, we are invited to gaze upon the women of the film as the white male anti-hero makes his way through his mission and his tragic life to the finish line, on top of all other types of race, class and sexuality.In Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Harry Lockhart (Downey Jr.) may be the white lead but the film portrays homosexuals as strong and intelligent characters (often stronger than the hero himself); it tempts us to act upon the gaze when the camera starts at the beautiful legs of a female character and tilts up only to show that she talking about sensible and intelligent issues to do with racism; and despite having one such character spend a great deal of time dressed in a fetishised Santa suit, she remains strong and hard bodied throughout these scenes; saving someone's life and overcoming an enemy that stands in her way. I said how the film toys with the notion of obligatory scenes; I loved the way the film builds up this past story that happened between Harry and another girl; about how much he liked her but they never got together  cut to the morning after and he's in bed with her friend after you expect it to be the initial girl. The obvious thing is ignored for something else and Harry must then proceed to apologise.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a film that realises its source material but puts a spin on things. The buddy combination genre is referenced when the films sole but strong homosexual character, Gay Perry (Kilmer) is teamed up with Harry but the film has the sidekick get the team out of the bulk of the situations. Whereas in a typical, flashy film of this nature and in this genre the hero is given a relationship of some kind; a love interest with a one-dimensional female character who does and says exactly what she needs to, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang denies Harry this and this is where the previous apparent obligatory scene where they meet each other for the first time in years comes back into play; what was once expected in films gone by is now substituted for something else. That is to say Harry has no relationships with any women for the duration of his adventure and is pretty much in a state of apology. The film would have the girl sleep in a bed, naked and tell Harry he may spend the night but what in any other film would no doubt be a sex scene or something of lower level intimacy; Harry takes up the room for the night offer and we cut to the next day.Even though Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is very much an emphasis on the visual over the narrative, this is no bad thing. The coincidences come in the form of: seeing a stewardess at the airport the next day as well as encountering just the right people at just the right time as they drive along a road at night and are spotted by a certain someone. But this isn't a bad thing; noir is famous for its long and twisting stories, often forcing us to come back for a second look. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the visual over the story but in a sense it isn't blasting us with special effects: The King Kong remake has fantastic visuals but the story is left untouched from the '33 version; likewise the third Pirates of the Caribbean film has plenty of visual but is lacking in narrative. Here, there is a balance of interesting story that demands a second look and flashy visuals that do not overwhelm us nor will they face the test of time in decades to come. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is recommendable on several accounts. There is the obvious energy and pacing the film carries; there is the toying of conventions we are familiar with in films; there are the elements of noir people will enjoy and the humour of the film involving some dark situations made surreal and funny. This may well go down as one of the better directing debuts a director has.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

54,funkyfry,Amusing action camp film,7,7 February 2007,"This film could be looked at many ways.... it could be seen as a kind of Lethal Weapon reunion, or an attempt by the producer (Silver) to try to bring back some of that ""buddy movie"" magic for the new generation. It could be seen as Shane Black's comeback, after the long exile imposed by angry moviegoers like me who paid actual money to see ""The Last Action Hero"", trying to enter himself into the ratified realm of poor fanboy's Tarantinos with hip post-modern reflections and irony on macho behavior. To me, the film was outright camp -- it did for action movies what ""The Raven"" did for Gothic horror movies.First of all, in the final analysis I don't think this is a great movie because there are too many thin scenes. For every great memorable line of dialog -- like ""When in doubt, cut up a pig - that was the town's motto."" -- there's a howling poor line even in comedic terms, like ""I was wetter than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club."" This movie tries just a little too hard to be off-center, sometimes leaving its heart behind in the wrong place. It's not quite a spoof, but it occasionally gets so ridiculous that any integrity in the characters is threatened.Through all the goofy tough-guy dialog there is an underlying theme -- a fairly generic one, but at least Black admits it -- the space between reality and appearance. Here we have a big tough guy who's the P.I. and he's an out of the closet homosexual. Our ""rising actor"" is actually a petty thief. As 'Gay' Perry (Val Kilmer) says ""This isn't good cop, bad cop. This is fag and New Yorker."" Harry (Robert Downey Jr.) is still obsessed with his high school crush Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), who of course is also not what he imagines she is. All of this revolves around the central idea of L.A. and Hollywood (and cinema itself) as a sometimes unconscious reflection of our fears and desires that lie beyond the surface. I really liked the performances, Downey is always great and this was the best thing I've seen him in since ""Singing Detective"". He really feels unpredictable and spontaneous. Kilmer makes a nice comeback as Gay Perry, not for one moment sinking to the level of any stock gay caricature. Monaghan is solid in her role, carrying with her the broken innocence of the idealized small town girl gone Hollywood. Corbin Bernsen appears in a juicy bit as a villainous film producer, and Larry Miller briefly appears as a guy at the party who says funny things. All in all I think it's a solid, fun film, never dull. But the characters didn't really seem real, except possibly Gay Perry -- a bit of irony there since superficially he's supposed to be the most unlikely. The movie just didn't catch fire for me, but I think it was far more amusing than any other film I've seen by Black, therefore I have to applaud some of the original aspects of this film and hope that it's a new beginning for this writer/director.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

That's unheard of in movies, but it works in this one!

Oh, and of course the two lead characters are pretty aware that their story is reflected in the form of their favorite pulp-fiction writer.This movie is worth the price of admission alone for the scene where Downey Jr. pees on a corpse and the several layers of serendipity that lead to an absurd (and delightfully proud of it) climactic showdown.

The two make an improbable but very entertaining pair. It's also nice that writer/director Shane Black and actress Michelle Monaghan make something a little more fun and complicated of 'the girl' than simply someone who looks good while waiting for Downey to get busy and kiss her.

59,MBunge,Too clever for its own good,6,9 August 2010,"This movie deserves its own Wikipedia entry as the living embodiment of the phrase ""gratuitous nudity"". It's a mystery story about a New York City thief (Robert Downey Jr.) who bumbles his way into being an aspiring actor in Hollywood. He gets caught up with a gay private eye (Val Kilmer) and a girl he knew as a boy (Michelle Monaghan) who's on the cusp of being a failed actress.It really is a pretty neat little mystery involving a dead sister, a severed finger, the old switcheroo and constant homages to a made-up series of pulp crime novels. But about half-way through the film there's a scene between Iowa's Own Michelle Monaghan and Columbia's Own Robert Downey Jr. where Monaghan's character goes into a bedroom and undresses and we briefly but quite clearly get to see her toplessand there's absolutely no reason for it.I'm not one to generally complain about female nudity, but it's just so obviously gratuitous in this instance. It doesn't tell us anything about Monaghan's character, advance the plot or service some underlying theme in the film. They try and pretend that seeing her naked inspires Downey's character to remember something important about the mystery, but 1. The filmmakers could have brought about that revelation in about a billion other ways that don't involve Monaghan's nudity.2. What kind of a guy sees a living girl's breasts and thinks of a dead girl's non-existent panties? If you watch enough movies, you see plenty of gratuitous stuff. Nudity, profanity, gore, blasphemy, etc. But in this instance it was sooooooo blatant, it made me wonder how they deal with the subject when they're making the film. Do the filmmakers come up with some elaborate lie about why we have to see Monaghan's character get naked? Does the producer have to come up with that lie at the beginning, or is it left to the director to come up with a convincing spiel on the day they shoot the scene? Are they honest about it? When they cast Michelle Monaghan, did someone go up to her, point out the scene in question and say ""Look. We think we can sell a few more tickets or rent a few more DVDs to desperate, horny losers if you show off your perky Pound Puppies""? Or is it some sort of societal taboo? Does everybody understand they're doing something cheap and unworthy, but if nobody says anything out louddo they all just pretend otherwise? Apart from defining gratuitous nudity for the ages, this is a pretty good film. The actors all give good performances and there are only two points in the movie where something stupid has to happen to keep the story going, which is a heck of a lot better than most mysteries. The writing is also smart and relatively clever, but that is also the one significant problem with the film.Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is one of those films that tries too hard to be too clever. Downey's character narrates the film in an ironic and self-aware tone, which would be fine in a more consistently and overtly comedic story. But many times the irony and self-awareness (and narration) goes away and it tries to play the story in a straight-forward, conventional style. And while the story is good enough to be played straight, the shifting back and forth between serious and satire keeps you from getting completely wrapped up in the film. I t's almost as though the filmmakers think they're too smart to be making a normal mystery, even though they've got a really good story to tell. So they keep throwing in amusing and mostly intelligent little digressions, but while they're enjoyable in their own right, they keep you from connecting with the characters as real people.You're never able to lose yourself in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and forget that you're watching a movie. And the filmmakers don't seem to want you to forget. They want you to be aware of and admire how they're telling the story. But in making the telling of the story more important than the story itself, they put a cool distance between the film and its audience and I can't help but think that a little less craft and a little more heart might have made a even better film.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

The movie is filled with dark humour with lots of funny scenes in between.Acting is good by Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan but Corbin Bernsen disappoints.Screenplay is good but funny punches in between.

61,noralee,"rollicking, loving satire of pulp detective novels and the noir movies based on them",8,20 November 2005,"""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a rollicking, loving satire of pulp detective novels and the noir movies based on them (as writer and debut director Shane White based this), particularly those set in Hollywood. But the fun and games don't get in the way of a twisty good story with lots of dead bodies, action and, of course, babes in the woods and femme fatale. Where White's previous buddy cop scripts threw in jokes between the violence, this one counts up the bodies amidst the jokes.The ""Catch Me If You Can,"" while the opening narration sets the tone for the satire, self-awarely sending up classics like ""D.O.A.,"" by making fun of the fact that it's narrated with rewinds and film stutterings, and then with lurid chapter headings. The references to other movies come fast and furious throughout, from ""Chinatown"" to ""Reservoir Dogs,"" as well as the novels of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett and their countless film adaptations, though the digs at Hollywood aren't quite as scabrous as ""L.A. Confidential."" Including scenes from a younger Corbin Bernsen crime movie is used here illustratively to the plot almost as integrally as the old Terence Stamp film in ""The Limey."" He certainly does look like a matinée idol gone to see, but then so does Val Kilmer.A key to making this all original is Robert Downey Jr.'s marvelous comic and earnest turn as a fish out of water as a crook imitating an actor imitating a private investigator, which even recalls what tends to happen to Bob Hope in the ""On The Road"" movies. He shoots off rapid fire wise-cracking dialog like an Olympic hurdler and creates a full character's range of little tics, particularly for unrequited love.It's an intentional joke that Kilmer plays his straight man as ""Gay Perry"" who uses his character's orientation as a clever and amusing twist on the macho-ness of a genre that usually thrives on sexual tensions. Michelle Monaghan spiritedly holds her own between these two pro's, but if it was supposed to be part of the joke that she is so obviously more the ingénue than Downey's old high school classmate who is over the hill in Hollywood at 34, that running gag isn't quite believable here. Maybe it was trying to be commentary on the usual Hollywood casting of younger women with older men.The cinematography beautifully capitalizes on the various L.A. settings of seedy nights and blinding days.Each scene goes off in unexpected turns that are both howlingly funny, yet serious within the typically convoluted plot, though the epilogue gets too silly even as it makes fun of epilogues.The closing song over the credits is from Downey's solo CD.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
62,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A bundle of hilarious fun,10,24 August 2015,"Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a riot from start to finish. It has one of the most snappy, sarcastic, intricately hilarious scripts I've ever heard, as well as a vibe of unabashed detective story escapism set against the trashy world of the L.A. film industry. Robert Downey Jr., in my second favourite performance of his, (Natural Born Killers takes number one) plays Harry Lockhart, a fast talking burglar who finds himself in L.A. by chance. He's being groomed for a role as a P.I. in a big budget flick, and being trained by actual private investigator Gay Perry (Val Kilmer). Yes, he's gay, before you ask, and Kilmer steals the movie. He's always had a wise cracking, facetious side, which he employs in overdrive here, giving us a hoot of a jaded, preening wiseass, with just the right hints of humanity buried beneath the blizzard of jabs and quips. They both get embroiled in a murky, confusing murder mystery plot involving the beautiful would be actress Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan). Monaghan doesn't get half the respect she's owed, and here flaunts her obvious talents well, latching onto the script wonderfully. The story itself is really muddled, and demands multiple viewings. But it's more about the exchanges between characters, the perfect comedic brew of awkward dialogue, snarky arguments and episodic, farcical antics that make this one such a treat. The script is beyond funny, and when you have actors like Downey, Kilmer and Monaghan in constant go mode, it takes flight and becomes something really special. There's killer funny work from Larry Miller, Dash Mihok, Rockmund Dunbar and Corbin Bernsen as a sleazy Malibu debonair as well. Go in with a focus on character and dialogue, as opposed to story. Save that for a later viewing. There's so much to enjoy in the acting and writing department that you won't even care what's happening, as long as you get to spend as much time as possible with these verbose creations of typewriter wizard Shane Black.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Shane Black never disappoints with his dark humour and his breaking the fourth wall which is very effective. I would say I enjoyed the first half more than the other half of the movie.

64,slokes,"The Sly, The Slick, And The Wicked",7,31 August 2007,"Shane Black helped invent the buddy-crime-movie genre as we know it today with his screenplay for ""Lethal Weapon"". Nearly 20 years later, perhaps feeling a bit guilty, he turns that same formula inside-out as the writer-director of the self-mocking, somewhat twisted ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"".Harry Lockhart is a small-time crook who suddenly finds himself cast for the lead in a Hollywood private-eye film. Before you have a chance to grasp that implausibility, Lockhart is on to another when his detective lessons with a real-life detective named Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) stick him in the middle of a real-life murder mystery involving his long-lost first love Harmony (Michelle Monaghan).Confused? Good. You're supposed to be. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" deliberately plays on every trope and cliché it can in a film that almost rudely aims over the heads of 90 percent of filmgoers in order to connect with film buffs and lovers of Lettermanesque snark. It pushes Spinal Tap's fine line between stupid and clever a few times but ultimately makes for a singular enjoyable experience, thanks mainly to Black's sense of style and wit and the zoned-in performances of his three principals.""My name's Harry Lockhart, I'll be your narrator,"" Downey tells us at the start. ""Welcome to LA. Welcome to the party.""It's like that the whole way through. Downey teases us with his winking narration while he and Kilmer trade one-liners with a smoothness that borders on boredom. Downey and Kilmer would seem like nightmare casting from numerous perspectives, yet here they develop an on screen chemistry that plays off each other's love for theatricality without overwhelming the affair. Black's dialogue plays expertly to their strengths, Kilmer's at being likeably obnoxious and Downey's at acting hurt but game.""You threw my gun into the lake? My $2000 ceramic Vektor my mother got me as a special gift!"" Perry fumes at one point.""I peed on the corpse. Can they do, like, an ID from that?"" Harry moans a little later.Monaghan is the film's strongest asset, a hottie with a sense of humor whose performance here rivals Cameron Diaz's in ""There's Something About Mary"" for making all the right moves. Whether laughing as Downey points out the near look-alikes in a Hollywood bar, crying over her sister's sudden death, or bouncing around in a bikini Santa suit, Monaghan is the best thing in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" going away.What's not as good about ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a plot that goes off the tracks too readily and a framing narrative that plays too many games for its own good. Larry Miller and Corbin Bernsen are lost in what should be key supporting roles, and the opening credit sequence is a rather bald-faced ripoff of ""Catch Me If You Can"".But ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is not only entertaining and engaging, but holds up remarkably well to repeat viewings, especially if you like movies about movies.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
65,Enchorde,"Peculiar, but great",9,11 November 2006,"Recap: Running from the police, NY thief Harry Lockhart pretends to be an actor and get sent to LA. There, under consideration for a role as detective, he pretends to be a real detective when he meets the girl of his dreams from back home when he was young, Harmony Faith. But something goes horribly wrong and Harry and his tutor, real detective Gay Perry, witness someone trying to get rid of a body. Seen by the murderers the corpse then turns up in Harry's shower, and he Gay Perry and Harmony gets sucked in a mystery with too many twists to be healthy for those involved...Comments: A very strange movie, first because of how Harry sometimes narrates it in a odd way, and sometimes it is shown as a normal movie. The main plot as well is peculiar, a great lot of twists and confusing details. But the result is really good, not to say great. Sure it is confusing sometimes, but if you really pay attention it is not that hard to tag along with the story. Look away for a moment though... or try to keep one step ahead.This peculiar style and story are very refreshing, kept me one my toes and engaged and interested all the way. Not only a great crime/mystery, the plot also combines a great sense of humor with a lot of absurd and funny moments and scenes. So the treat you're given is full of both suspense and laughter.Robert Downey Jr is in the lead, and with the support from Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan they pull of the demanding task to deliver the plot in a good way. This accomplishment is not easily done, and they do it good. It is good to see Kilmer in a great role once again.In conclusion, this is a movie with both thrills to keep you happy for the moment and depth and thought to keep your head going (or spinning). Simply great. I loved it.9/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Robert Downey Jr. Fits our rambling crook turned would-be actor caught in a murder mystery as convoluted as the kind of novels that influenced it...In this case, a fictional gumshoe paperback series by a fictional author mentioned repeatedly and extremely important within the story itself, and that both Downey and super-gorgeous dream-girl ingenue Michelle Monaghan (and some other strategic characters) grew up reading...So now the Middle-American-born thirty-somethings are stuck in the fast L. A. nightlife, one step away from death while their peripheral romance... of the vulnerable sap still in love with the hot chick who was always too good for him... seems straight from the Judd Apatow songbook...But it's Val Kilmer who glues everything together as Gay Perry, a successful and confident homosexual Hollywood-hired detective showing Downey the ropes... and yet both get quickly tangled up in the bedlam (you can almost hear Kilmer channel Danny Glover's famous ""I'm too old for this"" line)...So KISS KISS provides the once hot method-acting madman a role he can once again vanish into, but without trying too hard (THE DOORS) whilst providing more than rugged handsomeness (HEAT) which, at this point, is not only aged but slightly overweight and, randomly teasing the gay-trait stereotypes, he becomes both a befitting target and experienced muse for Downey's incessant quips...And there are several action-packed/high-octane moments in Black's hyperactive thriller where he's showcasing something more 1980's mainstream after all...Scenes of the polar opposite partners bickering (and even fist-fighting circa 48 HRS) is far more entertaining and intriguing than those Tarantino elements that can chase their own tails and wind up downright dizzying: But, for what its worth, KISS KISS BANG BANG is pretty much a good kind of dizzy.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

She's as flimsy as a dumpling. Maybe that was her name. I mean really. You know you're in trouble when a girl this dopey makes you expect that she's the setup for the real female lead.

But that thing ended there and then as the rest of the movie develops the story just like other crime movies do. Fortunately the story is quite good with all those little twists and the additional Harry's stupidity. The jokes are mostly dull particularly the dialog jokes. But the practical jokes were quite alright for me as they hooked some laughs out of me, like when Harry tossed Perry's gun or the scene with the finger and the dog. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting may be the biggest aspect that helped this movie to have the quite a good impression. He can really delve deep into character and depicted Harry's stupidity and clumsiness very nicely. Michelle Monaghan's attempt to look sexy utterly failed here as she doesn't really have the capability to act sexy. Val Kilmer's acting here is quite nice, constantly being the wise character to guide Harry.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Being teamed up with a detective to learn more about the role, the two witness the dumping of a body. This turn of events leads the two on a murder mystery with comedic results.Shane Black has a winner on his hands with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. It has everything that a movie could ask for. Two great leads that have perfect chemistry with each other, a beautiful lead actress, a comedic plot, a good story behind it and it's ultimately entertaining. Everything seems to click with KKBB. Kilmer and Downey are at their best and I hope to see them together in films more because they ignite the screen.Val Kilmer plays the ""gay"" detective and is remarkable. I've always been a fan of Kilmer, but here he has a chance to show his comedic tone and it plays off extremely well. Downey hits the nail on the head with this one. I'm not too keen on his performances, but here he has definitely changed my mind about his acting skills. Monaghan is surprisingly good here, I saw her in MI:III first, and she seemed out of place in that film. Here she fits right in with the heavy weight of Kilmer and Downey. Alas, this chemistry is even stronger because of the writing.Shane Black has a great mind for writing characters and their dialogue, one only has to look at the Lethal Weapon films to notice this. He has outdone himself here. With hilarious dialogue and awkward but down right funny moments in the film (Corpse pissing anyone?) Black manages to get great performances out of the leading actors, not only because they are great actors, but because of the writing. It's so fluid that it never misses a beat. KKBB keeps the punches punching and the laughter never stops.KKBB showcases some noir in it's detective story, and turns it on it's head. The film breaks down the barrier of it ""being realistic"" and bring the audience in on the joke. From Jr. getting ahead of himself and having to bring the reel back a couple frames to tell the story and talking to the camera at the end of the film. We are apart of the story, we're not just watching it unfold. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a great film that has gone unknown to the viewing public, along with The Boondock Saints, it's a film that pleases everyone who watches it, but if you were to ask John Doe about it, they would have no clue a film even exists. Would it's popularity hurt the film? Possibly, that's what makes KKBB so great, it came out of nowhere and hit us in the face. KKBB will without a doubt surprise it audience in how good it actually is, which is what makes for a great film.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

It even helps to know that one of the reasons Shane Black chose to use a Brett Halliday novel as backdrop for his story is because the hero of the novel is detective Mike Shayne (it's the Shane movie from the Shayne novel, get it?) A trivial point, but undeniably clever.More important is the way Black undercuts the audience's cinema expectations for the film's characters and action. The 'russian roulette' sequence is a bit obvious, but the finger-cut-off scene took me by surprise (and I'm pretty jaded about such things).It's true that Kilmer could have put a little more oomph into his character, but of course he's the reality-grounding of the film, so it's hard to say how he could have done better. Downey's twitchy performance would be annoying in another film, but fits perfectly here.The only moment that really doesn't work here is the ending; it's clear Black really couldn't come up with a topper, and isn't wily enough to just cut it off.Otherwise, I found this an enjoyable comic mystery. And in review of the reviews here at IMDb, I'm really surprised at all the comments on matters either trivial, irrelevant, or misinterpreted. This is a pretty good film to appear at a moment when we're not all that sure what 'a good film' actually might mean, and people are writing about it as if it were a television show with not enough commercials to allow them to go grab a bite to eat. Perhaps the era of the movie is over, after all.Well, what I saw was a movie, and a pretty entertaining one at that.

The same players made the parts of detectives and comedians not very badly. This isn't even the weakest part of the movie since the combination of the two kinds is well done and even the killings (lots of them) seem more funny than shocking. The weakest parts of the movie are first the story itself, a bit unconvincing and full of loose ends not very well explained and the filming rhythm which sometimes is boring and dull. There are lots of funny scenes but none of them deserving more than a smile. One last word for the narrative process which is a bit original, resolving itself in an almost permanent winking between the narrator (also one of the main characters) and the public by trying to associate the latter with the narration.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
73,sme_no_densetsu,"Mix two parts Kiss, two parts Bang, stir & enjoy.",8,11 March 2010,"Shane Black's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a crime/comedy hybrid of the sort that has proliferated in the years that Quentin Tarantino & Guy Ritchie have been on the scene. However, the difference in this case is that ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is an honest to goodness mystery.Robert Downey Jr. plays a small-time criminal masquerading as an actor. His agent has arranged for him to spend some time with a private eye (Val Kilmer) for the purposes of research. However, Downey soon gets embroiled in a murder mystery that involves his lost love (Michelle Monaghan), who is now a struggling actress.This convoluted setup offers a taste of the script's Chandleresque twists and turns. Like ""The Big Lebowski"", this film wears its influences on its sleeve, even going so far as to name the 'chapters' after works by Chandler. Stylistically, the film lies somewhere between ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Big Lebowski"". It is, first and foremost, a murder mystery but one that has a sense of humour, often in a postmodern, self-referential sort of way.Downey & Kilmer have excellent chemistry together while making the most of Shane Black's rollicking script. I have to admit that they were much better than I expected (Let's be honest, in 2005 Downey & Kilmer weren't exactly hot commodities). Even Michelle Monaghan's character proves to be not quite the usual romantic interest. Apart from these folks, there's not much worth remarking on but there's nothing below par either.Black's first-time direction is pretty good and the film looks attractive overall. I feel that the score & soundtrack were a bit of a letdown but that isn't a major problem. If you watch through the closing credits you'll hear a song by Downey himself but it's nothing to warrant him quitting his day job.Given the film's mix of crime & comedy it would be easy to lump it in with the likes of ""Pulp Fiction"" & ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" but that would be doing this film an injustice. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" occupies its own niche and does it well.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
74,pyrocitor,A savagely comic treat,10,5 July 2006,"After a few years of absence and somewhat of a change of heart regarding the nature of Hollywood, Lethal Weapon screenwriter Shane Black returns with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a cynical and shrewdly written comic masterpiece. Boasting one of the most cleverly written screenplays in modern film history, Black also makes his directorial debut here, and turns out to be the perfect man for the job, his cruel and savage humour creating a wonderfully twisted and entertaining picture. The story may become clever to the point of becoming somewhat convoluted and confusing, but that's the only complaint here as Black has molded a wonderfully entertaining and stylish film which sadly has been denied the accolades it truly deserves. Even the initial concept is side-splitting: Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.), a down on his luck thief, reduced to stealing his niece's Christmas gifts from the local department store, while running from the police after having his partner gunned down stumbles into an acting audition, and manages to convince the producers he is ideal for the part of a cop whose partner has just been shot, having just lived the real life equivalent. He is sent to L.A. to shadow a real life private eye, Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) who just so happens to be gay. Not much time passes before Harry and Perry are drawn into an intricate web of murder and intrigue, also involving Harry's high school sweetheart (Michelle Monaghan) who has mysteriously resurfaced in his life.Black's wonderful screenplay is really brought to life and taken to heart by the wonderful cast, especially leads Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer, who have a wonderful and incredibly enjoyable chemistry and back and forth repartee. Downey Jr., always a reliable output of talent is at his very best here, his fast talking and constant wary and confused facial expressions never fail to evoke laughs, and the concept of having a narrator make witty comments to the audience (""Times Square audiences please don't shout at the movie screen, and you... stop picking at that, it's only going to get worse"") and rewind the film to clarify certain parts is nothing less than genius. But Kilmer also proves a hilarious and even likable lead as unconventional gay detective Perry, who apart from raising many a laugh from the inevitable gay jokes also plays off Downey Jr.'s dumbfounded lead in a truly marvelous fashion. Newly emerging actress Michelle Monaghan (most recently seen in summer blockbuster Mission:Impossible 3) also deserves multitudes of praise for her adorable, enticing and charmingly funny turn as Harmony Faith Lane, a very unconventional and much more interesting feminine figure in the web of noire. The three leads create a 3 way chemistry which is truly a work of art, and bring life to Black's sublime script. All in all, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is easily one of the most enjoyable and stylishly made film in many a year - harsh, biting and ever so witty humour punctuating a clever and enticing noire tone. It's just a shame the film was so often overlooked by mainstream audiences. Don't make the same mistake - do yourself a favour and rent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang for a cinematic breath of fresh air. You won't regret it.-10/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
75,seymourblack-1,"""There's Something Wrong In Denver!""",9,19 July 2014,"This exhilarating high-speed comedy thriller is full of fun, action and excitement and contains a lot of quick-fire dialogue that's cool, sharp and extremely witty. Its complicated plot about an investigation into a murder mystery is typical of those featured in numerous classic film noirs but its overall style is also very contemporary. The juxtaposition of these two styles and the elements of parody and pastiche that are evident throughout, make this a very postmodern offering and a fascinating homage to the hardboiled detective stories that were so popular in the 1940s.Writer/director Shane Black clearly drew much of his inspiration from Raymond Chandler as he named the four chapters and the epilogue of ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" after well known Philip Marlowe stories and constructed a plot which was very Chandler-esque, as it's labyrinthine in nature and also features an investigation of two seemingly unrelated cases which subsequently prove to be linked to each other The obligatory narration is predictably clever, sarcastic and funny but also contains more updated aspects, such as a tendency to speak directly to the audience and a disarmingly amateurish quality which manifests when information is imparted out of sequence and freeze frames and rewinds have to be used to clarify what's being said.Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) is a small-time New York City thief who goes on the run from the cops after one of his robberies goes wrong and then escapes his pursuers by hiding in a building where auditions for a detective movie are in progress. Much to his surprise, Harry passes the audition and is flown to Hollywood to prepare for his movie role by shadowing a gay private investigator called Perry van Strike a.k.a. Gay Perry (Val Kilmer). At a party held by a wealthy entrepreneur called Harlan Dexter (Corbin Bernsen), Harry meets his childhood friend Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan) a girl who used to confide in him a great deal but frustratingly, never showed any romantic interest in him. Her attempts to make it as an actress had not been very successful to date and her greatest achievement so far was a brief appearance in a corny commercial.Harry and Perry are on a stakeout one night when they see a car being propelled into a lake and then manage to pull the dead body of a young woman from the wreckage. Later, Harmony tells Harry that her younger sister (Jenna) has been found dead and asks him to investigate the circumstances of her death. ""The Lady In The Lake"" is later identified as Harlan Dexter's daughter Veronica and a tenuous link between her and Harmony's ""Little Sister"" becomes apparent as one of Harmony's credit cards (which had been stolen by Jenna) had been used to hire Perry to be at the lake.After a complicated investigation that exposes Harry and Perry to great danger and leads them to a psychiatric clinic owned by Harlan Dexter, it becomes clear that Veronica's murder was connected with a feud over an inheritance and that Jenna's tragic death had been brought about in a totally different way.Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer make Harry and Perry's unconventional partnership one of the highlights of the movie and their banter is just brilliant. Michelle Monaghan also impresses with her ability to mix her character's comic side so successfully with her more mysterious qualities. Just like Marlowe, Harry gets beaten up regularly and is even tortured but is also quite modest as he recognises that he's a useless thief and readily admits to being a terrible narrator.""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" is tremendously entertaining, hilarious and criminally underrated and hopefully, in the long term will achieve the level of recognition that it so richly deserves.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
76,Terrell-4,"Clever and funny, maybe too clever, and with a fine performance by Robert Downey Jr",7,9 July 2008,"Part of me clearly appreciates the clever, loving riffs on noir movies, but part of me is seriously put off by the nudge, nudge, ain't I being clever pretensions of writer-director Shane Black. At one time, and maybe he still is, Shane was Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter, proud author of such big-time drek as the Lethal Weapon movies, Monster Squad, Last Action Hero and The Last Boy Scout. In other words, he knew how to hit a bulls- eye with the 18 to 28 male target audience. In Hollywood, that spells quality writing with a cap Q. With Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, we're witness to one of Hollywood's power players with a potty mouth wrestling with style and witty parody. The witty parody wins, but it's a close call. Why? Because Black can't resist self-congratulatory in-jokes and reveling in his own cleverness. He's the smart-mouth kid who tries to be the nonstop laugh and life of the party. The set-up is nice...petty thief Harry Lockhart is running from the cops in New York when he busts in on a talent call for a movie. In short order he's sent to Los Angeles for more tests for a part of a private eye. Real private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) is assigned to prep him. Then at a party he encounters Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), a woman he fell for when they were school children in Indiana. Before long Harry, who isn't too bright but is well meaning, is finding bodies in car trunks, on floors and in beds. He's beaten, shot, tortured and has a finger swallowed by a friendly mutt. Gay Perry keeps rescuing him, Harmony keeps tempting him and hit men dog them all. The mystery is almost irrelevant. It's the brittle style, smart-mouth dialogue, loving reverence for the noir sensibility and the acting that gives us pleasure. For my taste, Black's Hollywood insider cleverness in both the writing and the directing starts to get tiresome...not enough to be a complete turn-off, but enough that I wished he'd stop nudging us with his elbow. The movie chapter headings he gives us, each one a title of a Raymond Chandler novel, is a case in point. Clever and amusing the first time, tiresome the second time and ""alright, all ready, we get it"" each time after. Kilmer and Monaghan do fine jobs with their roles, but it is Downey who really shines. He now has a hard-earned, lived-in face that serves him well. He can handle drama as easily as comedy. With Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, his Harry Lockhart is not exactly a loser, but he certainly is slow at grasping essential facts. Downey gives Harry a great deal for us to like. Mainly, he gives us a well-intentioned guy to whom all sorts of things happen. Harry survives because he's serious, because he's loyal to Perry, because he loves Harmony and because Downey has superb comic timing. The title comes from Pauline Kael by way of an old Italian movie poster. Says Roger Ebert, ""These four words, she wrote, 'are perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of the movies. The appeal is what attracts us and ultimately makes us despair when we begin to understand how seldom movies are more than this.'""

78,fwomp,Impressive Chemistry Between Kilmer And Downey Jr. ...As Was The Dialogue,8,3 August 2006,"Harry Lockhart, (Robert Downey Jr., CHAPLIN) is a down-on-his-luck petty thief who accidentally gets his partner-in-crime killed one fateful evening while trying to burgle a toy store. Harry is able to slip away from the cops by stumbling into a movie audition and, to his surprise, procuring the part! He's whisked away to Hollywood where he meets up with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer, TOMBSTONE), a private eye who's supposed to help train Harry for his upcoming movie role. But things aren't as they seem. The only reason Harry was sent to Hollywood was to be the fall-guy for the murder of a young socialite. Harry also meets up with his childhood sweetheart, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan, NORTH COUNTRY) and sparks begin to fly ...right after she slams Harry's hand in a door, causing him to lose a finger.Harry and Gay Perry are forcibly teamed up together due to their circumstances. Harry turns out to be one helluva detective with the oft needed help of Harmony and Gay Perry. He also becomes deadly with a gun, forming a sort of running cliché throughout the film (this was pulled off VERY well, by the way).KISS KISS, BANG BANG is one of those films you have to watch to believe. So many stereotypes are ripped apart and so many clichés manhandled that it truly boggles the mind. Most  if not all  of this is done through dialogue, and it's wonderfully ridiculous how well Kilmer and Downey Jr. play off each other (there's even a kiss between them that makes for an interesting scene). Example: when Kilmer (who plays a tough homosexual) watches Downey pull a tiny gun out from his glovebox, Kilmer remarks, ""That's my faggot gun."" We also get to see Kilmer use the ""faggot gun"" in a very trouser destroying manner.The comedy in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is dark, similar in tone to THE MATADOR (another flick I absolutely loved). If you're ""in to"" those kind of films, you should most definitely check out this one. I'll be watching it again!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
79,rps-2,Symptomatic,2,16 March 2007,"To begin, the plot of this thoroughly confusing film is so woolly and complicated I have no idea who killed whom or why. However the film serves a purpose: it's symbolic and symptomatic of the decay of US society and of Hollywood's total lack of any moral code. Every second word is F**K or S**T when there was no need for it. Endless people are shot for no real reason. There is a constant diorama of nudity, violence and depravity in a society which disdains truth and honesty and where there no longer seem to be role models, standards and morals. It's always about advantage and outsmarting the other guy. It is an unfortunate and ill-advised attempt at a murder comedy. It could have been a good one without the constant garbage mouthing, bed hopping, crotch and tit shots, violence and gun play. My problem is that the extensive number of perversions depicted here are portrayed as normal, routine and acceptable social behaviour. You make movies like this then decry the homocide rate and profess shock at the number of pregnant school kids. (Isn't it odd that the IMDb computer censored the F and S words which originally had been spelled out. Yet they are in common use in just about every film listed here.)",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
80,TOMASBBloodhound,Destined for cult status.,9,14 June 2006,"Since Hollywood obviously had no intention of properly marketing or distributing this film, hopefully it will at least attain the cult status it deserves. Shane Black bursts back on to the scene with his first directorial effort. His script is just as sharp and funny as we've all come to expect from him. The movie business needs more creative originality like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang! The story centers around Robert Downey Jr.'s character Harry Lockhart who is little more than a petty thief. On night, while being chased by the cops, he accidentally walks into a casting session in New York and in his panicked state, he is able to convey enough emotion to land a part in a Hollywood film. We are led to believe this is the case, anyway. The script takes numerous twists and turns that are always making the audience reconsider what we're seeing. Once Downey is in LA, he is teamed up with a gay detective (Kilmer), ostensibly for training on how to play a detective in the film. His pairing with Kilmer is like many things in this film: it's a red herring. Following this plot is a little difficult for two reasons. First of all, Black can write some fairly complicated material. He's pretty good a being a screen writer. Secondly, the dialog of this film is so funny that parts of the plot may be lost in the audience's fits of laughter. I think that was my main problem, anyway.Downey and Kilmer are hilarious together. This may in fact be the best performance Downey has ever given. How many actors have to play someone who loses a finger not once, but twice in a film? He even gets electrodes hooked up to his balls! Kilmer underplays his part to perfection. He's not a flaming queen, but you can buy that his character is everything he's advertised as being. Michelle Monaghan is one to keep your eye on, and that isn't difficult. She's very pretty and brings a great deal of energy to her role. It just looked to me like everyone was having a blast filming this movie.Why did this film slip under the radar at the box office? You got me. I guess since it doesn't fit under one of the three categories that make up 90% of Hollywood film these days (remake, sequel, or based on a comic book) they didn't expect anyone to go out and see it. I don't think it played in any theaters in my town, and that's a shame. Talent like Shane Black must not be squelched by the powers that be in Hollywood! We need more films with original characters and based on original ideas! 9 of 10 stars.The Hound has spoken.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Robert Downey Jr./Iron Man/RDJ is straight HOT in this move, so hot, and Val is too. What was the point of this conversation again? It really doesn't even matter because I can't recall, but Val Kilmer/Nick Rivers/VK is genuinely funny in this, big surprise, not really, he IS Batman. KKBB has a super hot cast, is a super hot movie, and personally I love it. KKBB's quick-witted, fast-paced, comedic, actiony, deprived and really, really hot and sexy because of the boys, RDJ and VK, AAAAAND Miss Monaghan and her incredible sweet hot and sexiness. Michelle Monaghan's so hot in this movie, I love it, actually, I f'ing love it. Michelle gets naked in this, and when I think about this movie, KKBB, I think about Val and Robert's funny interacting dialogue on their crazy wild night with all the dead bodies popping up but mostly, I think about gorgeous Michelle Monaghan in her Santa outfit. I f'ing love KKBB. It's entertaining, heartfelt, and sorta lost in the shuffle of good movies of the time. O M S H Father Michelle's so ultra insanely hot in this movie, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, I'm not even kidding. She's pure ecstasy on a level insane! Michelle I love you so much more after watching this now than I did before. I want to rewatch The Heartbreak Kid just to see you in it, okay, KKBB is a smart, playful, fun charged movie that's a little boring. KKBB saved Robert Downey J's career rocketing (get it, rocketing, Iron Man, forget it) him back into the limelight. This is a must-see, for detectives, and actors, and crooks, and corpses, and writers and everyone alike, especially movie lovers. Val and Robert own this movie but Michelle makes it all worth it. I love Michelle so much she's so hot, in this. Drugs are bad. I'm watching KKBB right now if you can't tell, as I always watch whatever the movie is I'm reviewing. KKBB >> Sloppy, blood-splattered, scatter-brained, beautiful, hectic, hate and love tortuous tell-all titillating tale with super hot Val, crazy hot Robert looking good, and Michelle, Santa's little helper.

82,Maziun,"Quite good , even if too fast and goofy action comedy",7,7 December 2013,"The movie moves fast . Too fast for my taste. I hardly could get a grip on the whole investigation . The movie never bothers to allow you to calmly accept the information instead just moves along. It's not that the plot is complicated . It's quite clever , yet the movie doesn't really allow you to enjoy the plot twists. It's possible that the slower thinking viewers will be confused and like ""Huh ? But who and why ?"" . Same goes for the jokes . Everyone is fast talking , so fast you can't catch all the jokes . You can't even laugh out loud at some jokes , because the new jokes are coming . A good joke needs a 3-4 seconds to sink in . Otherwise it will be wasted . In my opinion Black's movie is too fast paced , but maybe that's me.Michelle Monaghan is HOT. She's probably the main reasons why I own this movie. Well , not the only reason , but a very good reason still. Val Kilmer gives a great performance as the serious homosexual detective . I've never thought he had comedic talent , yet I was wrong. Robert Downey Jr. is pretty much the same here as he is in his other movies – smooth talking, funny , likable guy with ego problems.Shane Black has a sense of humor and it's evident here too . I really liked his ""Lethal weapon"" and ""The last boy scout"" movies . ""Kiss kiss bang bang"" is funny too , even if the pacing is rather annoying. Black makes fun of fourth wall , Hollywood , detective movies , and crime novels. The movie doesn't take itself one bit seriously , yet there is a rather disgusting taboo subject that is very heavy handled here . ""KKBB"" sometimes thinks it's more charming than it really is and the humor is often too goofy for my taste.""KKBB"" is a good entertainment that is worth at least one watching . It doesn't hold too well on repeated viewings , yet the fans of crazy and fast paced movies should be pleased . I give it 7/10.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
83,Son_of_Mansfield,Love Love This This.,9,23 June 2006,"Shane Black takes matters into his own hands after years of bad directors ruining his scripts and creates one of the most enjoyable movies of the year. Tony Scott and Renny Harlin emphasized the action in the scripts while forgetting about cumbersome things like pacing, coherence, and character. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang walks the line between a blood and guts action film and a darkly comedic modern Noir. The result brings out the best in Black's script as well as actors Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. Downey's emaciated appearance and somewhat nerdy speech patterns make him the perfect Harry Lockhart while Kilmer's vanity and slightly effeminate voice makes this his best performance since he was Ringo's Huckleberry.

Once again writer Shane Black redefines the action buddy movie and elevates the entertaining and formulaic narration into extreme self deprecation, a bold move which felt too forced at first but eventually grew into a powerful character connection with Downey Jr's naturalistic delivery. Downey and Kilmer both play brilliantly off of each other, offering some of their most involved work in some time (especially Kilmer), creating hysterical moments of utterly clever contrasts in the two character's. While the plot does keep you on your toes throughout, the overtly implausible scenarios should cue in viewers as to not take it's unrealistic nature too seriously but quite the opposite-to revel in it's deconstructed cliché's and have a new type of popcornesque fun.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Instead, Shane Black decides: ""Fuggit, I'll go for the laughs from the cheap seats."" The Big Themes are present here - Evil, Regret, Forgiveness, Atonement - they are just never properly addressed. Shane Black manages to be slick, cool, ironic and charming in this movie. I just wish he hadn't weaved all that around child abuse. This is more cynical than Borat, but not as funny.

The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., and Val Kilmer as a robber fleeing and a private detective. The movie follows these characters as they navigate Los Angeles.This movie is incredibly funny. There is so much to the writing and characters that it is the best attribute of this movie. I found myself enjoying the solid performances from the two leads. Both Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. do an awesome job in the roles. The two characters that the two leads play have great chemistry on the screen and it shows in how they interact with the side characters. The audience will also enjoy how the story unfolds as the direction aids the comedy.The movie's story is ultimately nothing new. It makes for an engaging experience, but the movie is a mystery that embodies tropes that other mystery movies have done. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's best attribute is the sharp dialogue that makes for a fun experience to be had by any audience member.I would recommend 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'.Grade: B",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
88,DonFishies,Oozing with style and fabulous performances from Downey Jr. and Kilmer,9,14 June 2006,"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang was a movie I had heard about and seen trailers at the end of last year. I heard great things, and became even more intrigued when I heard it was written and directed by Shane Black, who created two characters who helped influence my love for film (those two obviously being Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh). But unfortunately, the film came out nowhere near me, and my hopes of seeing the film were basically sunk until the DVD came out. I waited in intense anticipation, and when it finally did come out, I did not hesitate to pick it up.The film is about Harry Lockhart's (Robert Downey Jr.) accidental trip to L.A. Harry is a thief who manages to get away from the police only to stumble into an acting audition and wooing the studio executives. He gets the part, and is flown to L.A. where he meets ""Gay"" Perry (Val Kilmer), a private detective hired to help train Harry for his eventual part. On their first training session, they witness the dumping of a body, and things only become complicated as both characters become mixed up in the dumping. Adding to things is Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), Harry's old high school crush who only make things even more complicated for Harry. The film is told in chapters with narration from Downey Jr., frequently lapsing into flashback, freezeframing and backtracking moments.Without ruining much more of the plot, Black has created a fine pseudo-take on the ""buddy cop"" genre. His screenplay is littered with thrilling moments and sequences of absolute dark hilarity. While not being a conventional buddy cop film, it has the familiar tired feelings, but feels more original than other entries in the genre. Downey Jr. and Kilmer are absolutely perfect in their roles, and have electrifying chemistry on the screen. Black's written words become so much stronger as the film goes on and these two actors play them out with the single best actor partnering of last year. Both perform excellently, and bring a sense of realism to their roles. Their charisma and class allows Black's script to truly shine. Monaghan, while obviously trying harder than the other two, has nowhere near the same amount of luck as they do in their performances. She comes off a tad bit weak in comparison, but still fares well in her role. The supporting cast, including the likes of Corbin Bernsen, Larry Miller and Shannon Sossamon are all great in their tiny roles as well.While being in the ""buddy cop"" genre, the film does have a lot of film noir and pulp fiction added in, both for comedic and dramatic effect. The colour palette for the film is stunning, as are the costumes. If it was not for all of the hilarious moments in the film, this could have made for a fine hard-boiled detective thriller. It has the gritty makings for one, and has plenty of well choreographed sequences to boot. Much of Harry's satiric narration even feels as if it was taken right out of a pulp novel. The film takes from the old school noir elements, adding in elements of old detective stories and films, and adds its own twist to them in order to make them feel more contemporary. While the film is nowhere near as stylishly versed as Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller's Sin City, it still breathes the same air. The seamless blend makes the film stronger, and much more memorable than others in the genre.The film is obviously not perfect though. The shortcomings in Monaghan's character are coupled in by a few questionably unrealistic and silly moments in the screenplay. Some may even leave the audience slightly baffled for a few moments. While the lack of realism may work for the most part in the film's favour, the silly moments really take away from it. There are a few subplots that could have been done without, yet they work well in the final product.My one question that still baffles me about the film is why Warner did not bother releasing it to a wider audience. It's a great little mainstream feeling indie film, oozing with style and fantastic performances from Downey Jr. and Kilmer. A definite candidate for most underrated film of 2005.9/10.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
89,LoneWolfAndCub,A very good crime/comedy,8,17 April 2006,"Kiss Kiss Bang is undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2005. This is Shane Blacks (the writer of Lethal Weapon) first directing job. He blends action, crime, thriller and comedy all into one, and does a very good job. The acting is perfect in this, Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer pull off their rolls brilliantly. And no one can forget Michelle Monaghan as the femme fatale, she is great and very sexy.It's hard to talk about the plot and not give away key points. But what I can say is that it is a murder mystery involving Harry (Robert Downey Jr.) who is a petty thief mistaken for an actor, who is sent to Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) to get lessons on being a Private Detective. At a party he meets high school sweetheart Harmony (Michelle Monaghan). The three of them are all together, trying to solve a complicated murder mystery, with many surprises along the way.This movie, despite two things, is an extremely well done movie that grabbed my attention and never let go till the end. The acting, as I said before, is brilliant. The music suits the movie perfectly, the script is well written and the action is suspenseful and great to watch.But there were to problems I had with the movie. One was the comic side of the movie. I did find that some of the jokes fell flat. Fortunately I found most didn't, but a few did. The last problem is, I found the movie trying to be a bit too smart. I.e, freeze frames, talking to the audience etc, etc. All which is not bad, don't get me wrong, it's just, this movie did it in a way which made me think the movie was trying to be smart to seem cool.But other than those things, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.4/5.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
90,policy134,"Trapped by too many ""clever"" lines but better than the very similar Black-scripted ""The Last Boy Scout""",6,22 May 2006,"Too much has been written about Robert Downey Jr.'s escapades that you have virtually forgotten what a great actor he is. Here he gets to play the nerdy ""best friend"" of the hot girl from high school. What Shane Black is trying to do here, I think, is to reverse the image he projected in ""The Last Boy Scout"". Though that movie was directed by Tony Scott you can see that he has been deeply influenced by him and even more by Quentin Tarantino, another writer turned director. The opening montage where Downey explains in narration about the plot is pure Tarantino.There is another aspect of this movie that should be mentioned and that is the way you are taken totally by surprise by the way the buddy movie plot runs it course. The detective played by Val Kilmer is less of an enigma but here is at last a Kilmer performance that doesn't make you wanna squirm in your seat. The way he doesn't make his gay character into a queen stereotype and still seem kind of dainty is really hard to pull off but he pulls it off in spades.The rather unknown actress Michelle Monaghan does make a great impression but a minor quibble with her performance is the way she doesn't seem to transform into anything else than a tough-as-nails woman character who just happens to fall for Downey for no apparent reason, other than the plot requires them to fall in love.The reason I do wish to recommend the film is because of Downey and Kilmer who is not a strange combination when you think about. 10 years ago I could never have imagined them as a team but I am glad I was proved wrong.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Seeing that this film has overwhelmingly good success in the reviews I thought I'd give it a go and as the title suggests, it just never fished me in.I found the film to be a bit pretentious and very hard to follow and I think this is why I found it difficult to be hooked into the plot. The characters I never truly understood either as there was little depth on them at all. I found the ending to be underwhelming as well. There wasn't any huge twist or anything of that nature so it just kind of falls flat.
I personally didn't find it funny, but a lot of reviews state otherwise so since comedy is subjective I maybe wrong on that front, but I felt the ""jokes"" just never really hit and this could be because I'm spending most my time wondering what the hell is going on.Overall I definitely expected better. It's not awful it's definitely watchable, but I think this could have been much better if it was just simplified.

What do you do?""",7,3 August 2006,"A lucky mistake shifts out-of-luck criminal Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr) from the gritty streets to glossy showbiz in L.A, landing him a part in an upcoming film. Another mistake then shifts him from actor to private detective, and this is where Val Kilmer comes in and things start to go wrong, more wrong and unbelievably wrong until they've snowballed into an enjoyable detective mess -- all to impress failed actress Harmony (Next big thing: Michelle Monaghan).Shane Black's directorial debut 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' is a comic film noir. Even in the dazzling opening credits using a montage of contrasts of red, black and white, it is evident that this is no run-of-the-mill crime story, but a viciously entertaining ride from scene 01. What makes it so special is that it mixes equal doses of humour and crime like a $15,000,000 blender, pouring out a balanced end product and glazing it with a clever narrative coating by Robert Downey Jr. Black also sprinkles some rapid-fire dialogue onto his product, which is facilitated by the comedic chemistry between Downey and Kilmer. Some of the lines, gags and images are truly laugh-out-loud worthy. Everything else is nice, but forgettable.Its only problem, as far as I can see it, is its paper-thin plot. It does not seem believable; it is complex, dizzying and not nearly as involving as it would like to be. So back to formula on that one, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang would be a near-perfect comedy-thriller.7.5/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
97,PyrolyticCarbon,"Superbly funny movie, Kilmer is excellent and Downey a close second. Very well written.",9,19 November 2005,"While I was watching this movie I recognised a scene and a still photo that I had actually found on the Internet months and months ago, in fact it's so long I might even consider that it was close to a year. That's a long time I've known about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and a long time that I've been looking forward to both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer being on screen together.Both are excellent actors, one has had many poorly chosen roles, and the other has had some poorly chosen habits. With this movie I was hoping to see both had dropped their poor choices of the past and moved on to something which promised much, much more.The first thing you're going to notice about this movie is confusion. The first half is fast paced with characters talking over each other and a style all of its own that just adds to the uncertainty of what the hell is going on, add these together and this confusion is one of the most attractive and fantastic qualities about the movie.It adds something new, not only to separate it from all the other movies out there, but also to separate it from your previous viewing. I can actually imagine watching this movie again and enjoying it just as much, if not more, than I did the other night as I caught it in the superb location of Edinburgh's threatened Cameo Cinema, Screen One.Lockhart's (Downey's) voice-over is quite unusual, it's not often you hear a narration of a movie nowadays, and it's much less that you hear one like this. In fact if I'm not mistaken the only other place where I've heard a narration play with the audience is in some more slapstick and in your face comedies...I may be wrong, and someone can correct me, but I've never seen this anywhere else.His voice over not only narrates the movie, but also pulls you around it. It'll stop the movie, leap about in time, and treat you as though you're sitting next to the narrator while you're watching. This is absorbing. It's not only funny at times, but it adds to that confusion of not knowing what's going to happen next or where you're going to be taken. You realise very soon that the movie doesn't have to follow the standard format, and that whenever the narrator speaks you could be in for another whip cut to somewhere, or somewhen, else.When you think about that idea of narration you might be forgiven for thinking that it could really turn you off the movie, and you'd be right. I really do hate being taken out of a movie, that is to say, when I'm watching it I am hopefully absorbed in the world presented to me. Having to query something I'm seeing on screen, for example, will quickly snap me out of a movie and it'll have to work hard again to get me back in.What's interesting about this narration is that it's effectively doing that all the time. You'll be in the flow of the story and a scene, and you're whipped out of it by the narrator and thrown back in somewhere else. However I found I didn't get pulled right out of the movie, just out of the level of the story and back to the narrator. I realised afterwards I was absorbed by the narrators story, and it was like I was viewing a movie within a movie! There's some excellent casting in here. Downey is superb, there's no question of that. Michelle Monaghan is lovely and is equally as good, and the casting of Corbin Bernsen is just inspired - I want a comeback from him right now! Yet there's one actor that outshines them all, helped along by his character and the superb writing, but for me this vindicates everything I've said about Kilmer to date, he's an amazing actor.Kilmer not only gets some of the best lines in the movie, but he gets the best character and some of the best scenes. The torture scene is hilarious, and the scene interrogating the orderly is fantastically written and performed.That's a point I've touched on a few times now, but it really needs proper credit. The writing is fantastic. The dialogue is real, quick and often over other dialogue. That makes it hard to catch sometimes, but gives the whole movie a very believable quality, and that just helps to pull you straight in.It also has a great way with moving from comedy to seriousness very easily, and you're not left with a movie fixed firmly in one genre and visiting another for a light moment. This manages to mix the two perfectly. One minute we're amazed at the feelings being portrayed (under the bed and being discovered) and the next we're having a good old laugh at the screen (the hungry dog scene). They are blended together superbly well.I found it very difficult to second guess the plot, and although some of the parts were quite obvious, others were totally out of the blue and surprised me. Something the movie does very well is let you discover things with the character (something I noticed of another movie I saw recently Where the Truth Lies.Here too, the surprises were not the point of the movie, the characters interactions and the situations they were getting into where what mattered. This made the movie for me, it's all about the characters.With excellent casting, especially with Kilmer, and a superbly written script, this movie is excellent and well worth going to see in the cinema.

However this is not a true story, just based on several as inspiration, and fortunately is a bit different, the dialogue is sharper, and it has spoof elements, with a voice over and ending scene which talk to the audience.The early part of the film is very confusing and the dialogue a little too quick, its hard to follow, however, like many movies, it does slow down a little to enable you to catch up and work it out, sort of! Burt the spoof element sort of ruins it a little, particularly at the end.The voice over by Robert Downey jnr is a little ok but not great, it has bits that should not be in it, His acting is good, as is Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan is particularly good, and the others are ok, no one is poor, the scenes are ok but editing is a bit too sharp, jumping from one short scene to another too quickly, photography is ok, music is a bit average.The differences from a usual Hollywood murder mystery make it as a film, but also let it down at the same time, It could have been a lot better is what I am saying, if it was a bit more usual.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

100,christian123,The most entertaining movie of 2005,8,2 September 2006,"Harry (Robert Downey Jr.) is a two-bit thief who ends up in Hollywood when hired to play a detective in a movie. There, he's teamed with Perry van Shrike (Val Kilmer), a real detective known as ""Gay Perry"" who shows Harry the ropes. They quickly get caught up in a complex mystery involving Harry's childhood friend Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), a failed actress who also deems herself to be a bit of a gumshoe.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the most entertaining movie of 2005. It offers plenty of laughs, thrills and even some suspense. I believe half of the credit should go to Shane Black since he is responsible for the very creative screenplay. He was able to mix different genres into one explosive film. The dialog was fresh and funny. The premise was interesting and it was carried out well. Also, the film made the viewer think about the story. It wasn't straightforward and that was a nice treat. The characters weren't developed too well but that didn't hurt the movie at all. Actually, there were a lot of good supporting characters that made the film even better.Behind the camera, Shane Black did a nice job with the film and there is very little left to say about his talents. The beginning was a nice introduction to the story and characters. The middle was the movie's strongest point and it never held back. The ending was decent and it was a bit surprising as well. The running time was a brief 98 minutes and it just flew by. The pacing was excellent and it never slowed down. There was some violence that was a little distracting but nothing too bad at the same time.The actors should also be credited for making this film such a success. The acting was very strong with Val Kilmer giving the best performance. He was hilarious and it was a shock that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Robert Downey Jr. was also pretty good as Harry. In this role, he kind of reminded me of John Cusack from The Ice Harvest. Kilmer and Downey had great chemistry together that really carried the film. It was never forced and they managed to produce many excellent scenes. Michelle Monaghan was clearly the weak link but even she gave a decent performance. Her chemistry with Downey was also decent. In the end, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is an underrated movie that's worth checking out. Rating 9/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

It's well shot and very slick, keeping a decent pace although it does drop here and there. All the performances were very good; Downey Jr, Kilmer and Monaghan all did a great job. I did find, however, that Downey Jr's character, Lockhart, did begin to get a tad annoying towards the end.

That's how Harry gets to Hollywood, where he meets his childhood sweetheart, Harmony Lane. Harmony is in so much trouble she can spare some for Harry. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is what I would call a murder mystery travesty, bustling with movie business references and whodunit clichés. Instead of hiding the script's pulp pedigree, Shane Black puts it on full display. For instance, Harry doubles as an off-screen narrator and keeps commenting on what his character is going through. Initially, it feels a little goofy, but once you get into the mood, it's actually a lot of fun. Fine performance by Robert Downey as hyperactive Harry. Downey's son Indio plays Harry's younger self, Harold the Great. Michelle Monaghan is super hot in the part of the girl next door. Guest appearance by Shannyn Sossamon as a dead chick.

It's not serious, it's not the crime drama thriller of 2005. It is a fun movie that has the most awesome one liner collection of 2005. Robert Downey JR is a dumbass that is mentored by the Unwilling Val Kilmer in the form of Gay Perry- an LA detective that generally knows the ropes all too well. He is fast talking smack talking that runs circles around Downey's attempts at understanding what the hell just happened. It's a great character foil to play off of and there is a LOT of play!If you hate Val Kilmer or RObert Downey Jr. you just wont dig this but if you are neutral towards them you will still be laughing your ass off. The lead lady is a cutey and that's nice. Just too bad she doesn't shake that sweet butt naked a little more often. The plot has lots of flashbacks but not in the cliché form of pulp fiction/memento that became passe a few years back. Don't even bother trying to figure out who did it and why- that's not the point... it's the fun of getting there that is the point and it's a LOT of fun!This is what you can classify as a ""dark comedy"" meaning it's funny and some people wind up getting killed.SEE THIS!

He runs into a casting room for a new movie. Still startled from his friends death, his emotions are high and the casting people think its improve and gives him the job as the leading man. Harry starts getting lessons from a private detective, Gay Perry. Gay isn't the most conventional detective and during an assignment, they both witness a murder. They are both drawn into the plot when Harry's old time friend Harmony is dragged in when her sister is murdered, who they feel is the same people. So they are piecing it all together to figure out how is behind it all.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang moves at such an unrelenting pace. It never slows down. In a sense this can be good as it never gets boring as there is always new information flying at you which you need to catch to piece the puzzle. But the constant fast pace does gloss over plot hole, but they are so glaring at you. The script was so bogged down in the dialog that spews forth from Robert Downey Jr. He is always talking at such a rate it gets irritating. A lot of the script seemed to intelligent for its good. It always seemed like it was trying to prove what a great mystery it was presenting but instead of working on the foundation just built the structure. The narration from Harry's character wasn't really needed. I was glad it stopped during the middle and only came back briefly at the end.Not saying it was a complete waste of time. There are some good jokes, ones that surround the dead corpse are so wrong. There are some good jokes about the shallowness are plastic nature of Holloywood. Shane Black's direction is very good, with a lot of the blue washes used to good extent. The acting was good. Downey Jr. inhabits Harry well, though he does get irritating.

""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" had me laughing hysterically.I've never been a fan of Shane Black, so I wasn't expecting to like ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" so much. After reading the professional reviews, I was expecting this to be an action-comedy, but it is actually a full blown farce. It's kind of like a cross between ""Curse of the Jade Scorpian"" and the ""Naked Gun"" movies but with better dialog and less sight gags.Val Kilmer is the funniest he's been since ""Top Secret."" He plays a gay detective, but he never acts particularly gay and he always uses his sexual orientation to his advantage to throw off the bad guys. Robert Downey Jr. is pretty good, except he has a tendency to mumble through some of the narration. Michelle Monaghan reminds me of a young Sandra Bullock and looks really good in her Santa costume.This Fall has been full of disappointments. ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" is a pleasant surprise.

107,come2whereimfrom,black is back,8,28 April 2006,"I have always had a soft spot for films with a voice over, and kiss kiss has a narrator in the superb Robert Downey Jr. As the film begins we are introduced to Downey's wisecracking con man turned accidental actor who eventually turns into a private detective, sort of. Don't worry if none of this makes sense it will if you watch the film. With a brilliantly clever and fast paced script from Shane black the film is so stylised from the start that it is a joy to watch. The intertwining storyline based loosely on 50s crime thrillers but with references to popular culture it is a post modernists field day. With great support from Val Kilmer as a gay detective the ideas of male masculinity in films are opened up for debate. With techniques right out of Tarantino's book of direction the film flips, stops and starts again to add more depth to an already thrilling film. The other main thing to say is it is also very funny, at times the one liners move so fast you feel as if you are playing catch up. But I laughed and really enjoyed this movie. It is interesting, fresh and fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously and its great to see people like black and Downey back on top form.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
108,ExpendableMan,A brilliant exercise in wit and style,9,17 April 2006,"Shane Black, director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang originally became famous during the late 80's when he hit the big time writing the scripts for the Lethal Weapon movies and that infamous ""John Maclane with a hangover"" movie The Last Boy Scout, so the film certainly has a few expectations riding on it. Luckily for Black, his comeback film is a joy to behold; packed full of the same razor-sharp comic dialogue and laced with the same hints of darkness and brutal violence that his earlier work was. However, it is not just a simple retread of past glories but a fully fledged piece of art in it's own right.Robert Downey Junior here is Harry, a bumbling small time thief who through a series of coincidences and misunderstandings finds himself sent to LA for a movie audition where he is instructed to 'research' his role with the tough as nails gay Private Eye Perry (Val Kilmer in a scene stealing turn). Perry and Harry though soon find themselves in over their heads when they come into possession of a murdered girl's corpse and pursued by kidnappers, while at the same time getting mixed up with Harmony (the gorgeous Michelle Monaghan), a struggling actress whose sister has just recently committed suicide. The ensuing plot may be rather difficult to follow on first viewing, but this is a film that rewards repeat watches as there are always great lines to pick up on that you may have missed first time.The central trio of Perry, Harmony and Harry couldn't be better cast and are the main reason for the success. Monaghan's star making performance is sexy and self-confident, a direct contrast to Harry's naive and boyish charm but Kilmer is in a class of his own. As Gay Perry he has some of the sharpest lines in the entire movie and while it may be difficult to believe, Kilmer appears to have escaped his recent career slump in a turn that echoes Travolta's ultra-cool return to form when Pulp Fiction was first released.The Tarantino similarities do not end there either as the story is also laced with the same hipster violence and black humour that the banana-chinned boy wonder is so fond of. Harry accidentally loses his finger at one point and his subsequent entry to a bizarre Hollywood nightclub while goosed up on Demerol is one of the most surreally hilarious scenes in the movie and a Russian Roulette threat that ends in disaster later on is similarly entertaining. What's more, Harry also operates as the film's narrator and is constantly referring to events in the movie or 'rewinding' footage to show previous incidents from a different angle; effectively breaking the third wall but never allowing this flashy approach to narration to overshadow the rest of the film.That said, amid all the comebacks that you just wish you could come up with while arguing with your mates, there's also a dark underbelly that the Lethal Weapon films possessed as well. One scene involving Harry laid beneath a bed while a young girl is murdered on top of it is incredibly brutal but also uncompromisingly sad too, a brief look at the girl's eyes being racked with poignancy despite the fact she's little more than a supporting character.So to sum up, Shane Black has done it. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a glorious slice of pop-noir that should hopefully return him to the Hollywood elite he criticises so much here. It's a riotously enjoyable buddy movie and face it, you just have to see a movie that can make Val Kilmer cool again don't you?",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

111,anhedonia,THIS is why we go to the movies,9,31 December 2005,"""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" won't be considered a masterpiece in the great pantheon of films. But, I can't remember the last time I so enjoyed myself at the movies.It looks like the years Shane Black took off to do whatever it is he wanted to do has paid off. He has come back with - pardon the pun - a bang.Black does not make any excuses for the film he's made. This film works because its tongue is planted firmly in its cheek. Black knows film noir, he knows the conventions, he knows the dialogue, he knows the writing, he knows the milieu, he knows characters. And he also knows how to create a paean to film noir while also poking fun at the genre.The plot? Well, to be honest, it really is immaterial to this film. But it has to do with crook Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) running form the law, finding himself cast as a private eye in a movie and getting the help of a real gumshoe, Gay Perry (Val Kilmer). And, of course, there's a moll - Harmony Faith Lane, played brilliantly by Michelle Monaghan. This woman's going to be a star. She's breezy, fun, smart, sexy and knows how to be funny when the need arises.The plot is convoluted but, then again, Black really doesn't want you to be paying attention to it. And it doesn't matter because we're having way too much fun enjoying his sharp wit, crackling dialogue and sure-fire pacing. (And, even Raymond Chandler, to whom Black pays homage in this film, once said the plot for the classic, ""The Big Sleep,"" was so convoluted even Chandler didn't know who killed one of the characters!)What Black's doing is having fun. Loads of it. From the marvelous opening credits to the wisecracking voice-over narration. Given its smartassed attitude, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" should be annoying. But it isn't. Because Black got two of the (reportedly) most difficult actors to work with - Downey and Kilmer - and extracts wonderful performances from both.Downey has never been better. He's comfortable as Harry, as if this were something for which he'd been rehearsing all his life. He savors Black's quick-witted dialogue and proves what a fine comic actor he is. The trick to Downey's performance is that he plays his role straight. Kilmer proves to be the perfect foil and shows that there might be a career in comedy for him.This film isn't going to make one think about the nature of man or contemplate about the human experience. But it's fun. Incredibly fun. If you enjoy film noir and like seeing its conventions turned upside down, don't miss this film. It's a popcorn film and doesn't hide that fact. Black wanted to entertain us, for us to get lost in his crazy world for a while and to enjoy it. And that's what he did. He also proves that Pauline Kael was right - all you need in a movie is kiss kiss, bang bang.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

114,rparham,"""Kiss"" this funny film",8,26 October 2006,"In the genre of comedies with a film noir bent there are, well, there is really only one, and that is Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. Oh sure, there have been comedies that used the film noir milieu as their setting, but really no film has attempted to be both a comedy and a noir thriller at the same time. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is definitely that, and it does a generally good job of working in both universes, although it is certainly a more effective comedy than a noir, but it gives the latter a good shot.Harry (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a crook ripping off a department store in New York City (trying to steal a present for his daughter, no less) when a twist of fate causes the alarm to sound and Harry runs for it, happening upon an audition for a film featuring a police detective. The producer (Larry Miller) immediately thinks Harry is method acting and packs him on a plane for L.A. There, at a party, Harry meets ""Gay"" Perry (Val Kilmer) a real private detective who is a friend of the producer who will give Harry ""Detective Lessons."" Oh, and he's gay, hence the name. At the same party, Harry runs into a girl who turns out to be his high school unrequited love, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), whom he tries, and stumbles, to be build a renewed relationship with. When Perry and Harry go out on a surveillance job, as part of Harry's detective classes, they end up with a dead body and men chasing them. The situation becomes even more complicated, with the apparent suicide of Harmony's younger sister and connections to a rich former actor (Corbin Bernsen). What appeared to be just a routine job becomes a complicated web of lies, deceit and bodies.Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang was written and directed by Shane Black, the writer of the original Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight, and anyone familiar with his work from those films will instantly recognize his style here. Black is one of a select few (principally only Kevin Smith otherwise) who can write absolutely hilarious dialogue that is interlaced with copious profanity and not have it seem excessive. His gift for witty repartee is impressive, and a great many scenes in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang are absolutely roll on the floor, bust a gut funny as Harry and Perry verbally jab at each other (A good example: Perry: ""Do you know what you will find if you look up the word idiot in the dictionary?"" Harry: ""A picture of me?"" Perry: ""No, the definition of idiot, which is what you are!""). Most of this film rides on the collaboration of these two characters, and they both pull off their scenes beautifully. At the same time, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is a film noir, complete with voice over narration, and an appropriately twisty plot. These elements of the film are played with a certain amount of levity and self-awareness, especially the narration, which Downey delivers with a wink and a nod to the audience. It plays more like a screenwriters commentary on a narrative, and while it adds to the appropriate feel of a noir, it does so with a unique bent on it. The plot is indeed full of twists and turns, and even when it comes together at the end, we get a sense that everything has been resolved without really knowing every little detail. The light tone, and the strong identification with the characters defuses whatever questions there are left at the end. This is a film that is driven by it's energy and it's dialogue, not its plot.Downey, Kilmer and Monaghan are all excellent in their roles. Downey's performance is so strong that you can't help but forget his real world troubles and be pulled in by what a terrific performer he is. Kilmer is also great in one of his better performances in a while. He really sells Perry as a hard nosed detective who is more concerned with not getting his nose too far into where it doesn't belong who eventually has to realize that he needs to do the right thing. Monaghan is also effective in her role, playing a somewhat clichéd role in a non-cliché manner. She is a light, breezy comedienne and her scenes with Downey sparkle with chemistry (something missing from countless other film romances these days).Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is no masterpiece, nor does it intend to be. It's an enjoyable, entertaining mix of two genres that is fun to watch and absolutely hilarious at times. There are few comedies out this year better than this one, and it is worth a spin.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
115,roland-104,Hip Hip Fluff Fluff,7,23 November 2005,"Here's a sophisticated little postmodern film romp, an L.A.-based murder mystery adapted from pulp writer Davis Dresser's (a.k.a. Brett Halliday) 1941 novel, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them."" Shane Black (who wrote the screenplays for ""Last Action Hero"" and the ""Lethal Weapons"" series) has written - and made his debut directing - a slick movie full of hip, facile dialogue that is self-referential to the max.The mystery story itself and other subplots are adroitly interwoven. Using his central character as narrator and interlocutor, Black also liberally employs the metafictional tactic of discussing the crafting of the film at various points directly with the audience.Robert Downey, Jr., displays his best comedian's chops here as a naïve newcomer to town, a petty criminal from the sticks, Harry Lockhart. He is saved on countless occasions by the savvy of Val Kilmer, who plays a wise private eye called Gay Perry for an obvious reason. After each rescue, Perry never fails to remind Lockhart of his stupidity. The two actors play hilariously against one other.Less interesting in the lead acting trio is Michelle Monaghan, who plays Harmony Faith Lane, a failed actress who turns out to be Lockhart's long lost love interest from schooldays.There isn't much meat on these funny bones.

116,TheMovieMark,My kind of dark comedy.,7,22 November 2005,"The term ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" was first coined in the 1960s by the Japanese press as a nickname for James Bond. Director Shane Black loved the term and chose it as the movie's title because, ""it so clearly represented what this film is."" And what exactly is this film? Good question. For starters, it's original. It's a nice change of pace from all of the sequels and remakes we've been inundated with recently. I needed this breath of fresh air after being blind-sided by the news that a remake of Robocop might be on its way.It's also funny and action-packed. The pace comes at us almost as quickly as the clever dialogue, making it nearly impossible for the average viewer to get bored. You may be offended, you may not appreciate the dark humor, and you may not get the style, but I would predict the majority of you won't get bored. Will I refund your ticket money if you *do* get bored? No, absolutely not. Don't be silly. I'll just say, ""Oh well, I guess you're just in the minority on this one!"" What I like most about Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is it's so hard to ""genre-lize."" See what I did there? Add that term to the Movie Mark Dictionary. When you can't ""genre-lize"" something then you can't easily force it into any one specific genre. Clever, huh? That's what makes Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang so fun. Is there action? Yes! After all, it's by the same guy who wrote the Lethal Weapon movies. But it's not an action movie.Is there humor? Indeed. The laughs mostly come from the chemistry between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. and some of the crazy situations they find themselves in. This is my kind of dark humor. I love to be caught off guard by unexpected moments that make me laugh at things that might not be so funny if they were witnessed in the real world. But this isn't a comedy. The humor is never forced and doesn't have to resort to slapstick or flatulent puppies just to get cheap laughs. Sure, there's a scene that involves peeing on a corpse, but it has to be seen in its context to be appreciated.If I were forced to affix a label to this then I suppose I'd say it's a darkly comedic murder mystery. It takes itself just seriously enough to keep you in suspense, but it's irreverent enough to simply be fun and entertaining. It works well enough as a farce without ever coming off as a pure parody.My main complaint is that the story does get a little too confusing. I admit that I openly mocked other reviews that called the story ""needlessly complex,"" but now that I have seen it I totally understand what these reviews are talking about. You'll want to pay careful attention or you'll get lost pretty quickly. I'd even suggest taking notes. If you're not careful you'll become so immersed with keeping up with the rapid-fire dialogue that you could lose focus on the plot details. It's not mind-blowing, but there are just so many characters and minutiae to keep up with that it's easy to lose track of what exactly is going on. If your friends call you ""ol' goldfish attention span"" then you could be in trouble.I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this movie is for everybody. The language gets pretty rough, there is strong sexual content, Val Kilmer is a detective who just happens to be gay and jokes are made at his expense, there's a decent amount of gunplay, and some people just might not appreciate the unconventionality on display.But I loved the fact that this wasn't formulaic and that the look and style was different than the norm. Black admits to de-saturating the colors in post-production to give the film a crude, rough look. Perhaps some might like their movies a little more bright, but I thought it was quite effective at giving the film the pulp detective story vibe that Black was going for.I wouldn't recommend this to my mother, so I won't pretend to know whether this fits *your* taste either. It all depends on how you view these kinds of things. Is it gratuitous or knowingly over-the-top? Clever or too clever for its own good? Cheesy or comfortable in its self-awareness?

118,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Fun Till It Lasts!!,7,29 March 2014,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. It's a crime comedy with less crime and more comedy. A murder mystery brings together a private eye played by good Val Kilmer, a struggling actress played by stunning Michelle Monaghan and a thief masquerading as an actor played by ever charming Robert Downey Jr. Movie impresses you more with its witty dialogues coming at rat a tat speed, some outrageously funny situations and nice acting displays at few moments. But story seems too convoluted to make much sense leaving you with lots of doubts in the end. First half makes the plot mysterious but second half really does not create chaotic fun like we get in Guy Ritchie's movies. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Despite its problems with script, it is a fun ride.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
119,JaydoDre,"Funny, smart and dark",8,9 May 2014,"This movie really needs a better title. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang makes it sounds like a cheesy badly acted action movie. However, to the contrary, this one is pretty damn good! This dark comedy has a peculiar style. It starts out with events that follow one another with almost no reason but more and more connections are made as the movie progresses, which is not only the movie's style is also part of the plot. It's fast paced and flows very well. The experience of watching this film is akin to a ride down a water slide while listening to a comedian.Have to admit, I am surprised at how dark the jokes are. I always thought people are touchy about that sort of thing, but I guess the film is too well put together and funny to bother anyone, as the generally positive reception suggests.Having said that, in its haste, the mood of the film does take a few missteps. There is at least one really bad event that happens to one of the main characters, and yet moments after it happens, that person is joking around as the movie decides it's time for another adorable line. That sort of stark mood change that keeps returning throughout the film feels contrived. But then again, it fits the chaotic style.The story is not that important anyway because this film is constructed almost wholly upon actor performances, and luckily, Robert downey junior is an even more charismatic actor than his more recent success, Iron Man, had lead me to believe. He is fast on his delivery and perfectly fits with the pace of the film. Val Kilmer, who partners up with him for this flick, has had his bad roles and his good roles. This is definitely one of the good ones.So, story and mood are a bit..all over the place, requiring attention for the viewer to keep up, but the actors are adorable and the film is funny.

Just like Tropic Thunder, it's produced by big producer and big-method actors, and it's self-conscious in a positive way. Robert Downey Jr. is definitely a genius in narrating. His narration of the whole situation and his emotional involvement made this movie a must-have for those little-budget movie fans, as well as those who just love to see Charlie Chaplin suffering.Those funniest moments in the movie all came in at a time you won't expect, and all the threads naturally lead to more fun and more candies for eyes, which may make you feel guilty. Michelle Monahan was really really hot while Downey was really really dumb. This couple should be really happy in the reality. Ah, if I tell you more the movie won't be that entertaining.

It is so exciting to have Shane Black back on the screen with such a well written and developed film.The cinematography, sets and the downtown location of Los Angeles, along with the hysterical dialog and scenes with Downey and Kilmer create a story that just hustles the audience along and you just never know what Mr. Black might have in store for his characters.Michelle Monaghan is a stunner and her journey and participation in the story makes each frame she is in come alive with her beauty and sense of humor in her role. Corbin Bernsen is a kick in his role of a dark and rather perverted LA character of which he could represent a cast of thousands in the film industry.

126,Geofbob,A spoof maybe; but the genuine 24 carat article,9,21 December 2005,"What an enjoyable film this is! And for so many reasons - it outdoes Tarantino in post-modernist touches, and matches him in violence; it's hilariously funny most of the time, with lightening fast dialogue; and it plays variations on several familiar genres, including the classic 40s film noir, the Hollywood exposé, and the buddy-buddy movie.On paper, much of the screenplay is formulaic - the duo who don't get on, but have to; shoot-outs where our heroes are miraculously invulnerable; bodies which mysteriously disappear and re-appear; and a labyrinthine, opaque storyline. But this hardly matters, when every aspect is handled by the director and his team so cleverly and originally. Even the plot makes sense by the closing credits - well, sort of! What makes the film work, above all, is the casting and pairing of Robert Downey Jr as Harry Lockhart, a small-time crook on the run in LA, with Val Kilmer as tough and cynical, private eye, Gay Perry, whose first name, for once, is more literal than ironic. Downey, in particular, is brilliant, investing his character with a depth and subtlety, you just would not think possible in such a fast-moving, action- and gag-packed movie. That Lockhart has scenes which allow Downey to display his tender and vulnerable side is due to an ingenious plot, which brings in genuine love, not just sex, interest, with Michelle Monaghan as Lockhart's childhood sweetheart and failed starlet. (Take it from me, the film isn't nearly as slushy and hackneyed as my last sentence makes it sound!) Continuing in sentimental mode, it would be nice to think that Downey Jr has or can overcome his personal problems, and can now forge ahead with his big screen career. In the meantime, he and director/writer Shane Black deserve every credit for this hugely entertaining movie.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
127,Jonathon_Natsis,Murder has never been funnier,9,2 February 2011,"What a little gem of a film. Many would put it in the often-mentioned 'best films you've never seen' category, and I would not be one to argue. Shane Black sits in the director's chair for the first (and to date, only) time and co-writes the screenplay to this part murder- mystery, part comedy; big on action, plot, one-liners and enthusiastic performances from all involved. The plot of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is relatively stockstandard. It centres on three main characters, each sharing close-to-equal screen time: Harry (a small-time thief masquerading as an actor), Harmony (his love interest) and the cynical but equally hilarious Gay Perry, a shrewd private eye who comes to the assistance of the other two when they are implicated in a murder case. However, with all due respect to screenwriters Black and Halliday, the ins and outs of the plot inarguably take a back seat to the film's near-perfect adherence to some of the more applicable conventions of noir filmmaking, while being original enough on its own merits to remain extremely entertaining.Released back in 2005, the film stars Robert Downey Jnr. during what were still the baby steps of his triumphant return to the film industry. And speaking of originality, RDJ not only delivers a performance abundant in expert comic delivery and noir voice (his cynical narration of a fancy LA party in the opening scene gives you a sense that you're about to witness something special), but one which couldn't be further from his most famous role as Tony Stark, which has both placed him in the category of most-skilled modern day actors, and netted him an approximate seventy bajillion dollars in the process. Michelle Monoghan is by no means weak as Harmony, but she does get overshadowed by her two co-stars. In particular, the underrated Val Kilmer makes an excellent turn as the wisecracking Gay Perry, whose interplay with RDJ's Harry throughout the film never lets up on laughs or quality of dialogue. In fact, it is the extraordinarily unique screenplay that sets this film apart from what might have been just another poorly constructed buddy comedy. Showing occasional glimpses of scriptwriting talent in the Lethal Weapon series, Black has truly set himself a new benchmark here, with a tight script that compliments the rapid pace and noir cinematography of the film.As far as humour goes, there is a heavy dose of both slapstick and farcical scenarios to make anybody laugh, coupled with wordplay that, if it fails to make you burst out laughing, will certainly put a smile on your face as you appreciate how much effort actually went into creating original jokes. If I had to state one negative of the film, it is that the Second Act briefly gets too convoluted with the all-too-rapid introduction of secondary characters (some living, some dead), most of whom serve no other purpose than to act as red herrings, failing to deceive the rest of us. That being said, this really is a minor gripe of mine and, since those tangent arcs are wrapped up logically by the film's climax anyway (as all good noir thrillers do), it should by no means discourage you from immersing yourself in this expertly-crafted fairytale of sex, sin and luxury.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

130,Barky44,"Funny & entertaining, but also a bit droning",8,13 January 2007,"""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is another film in one of my favored genres: an action/comedy, where the action (albeit fast-paced) plays second fiddle to some intriguing characters and great dialog.There's a lot of great stuff in this film. There's a hilarious flashback scene involving overacted kids' magic tricks right at the beginning, which starts the train rolling. There's a lot of quick-fire insults and jibes in this film that make it a real ball to watch, and at no point does the film take itself too seriously.The only thing that got on my nerves was the continuing narration by Robert Downey, Jr. In my opinion, it's really difficult to write and deliver continuing narration in a film. Only certain writers can do it well, and only certain actors can deliver it. Sadly, I don't think neither can handle it here. Personally, I think they could have had the opening narration and bagged the rest, it becomes unnecessary and even distracting.Otherwise, kudos to the filmmakers and actors for making a really entertaining piece of work.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
131,Simon_Says_Movies,"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang; a film you can't help but love love.",10,26 May 2009,"There are 4 types of movies around in the world today. Movies you immediately love and will always love. Movies you once loved, but with subsequent viewings have grown distasteful. Movies you immediately hate and will always hate. And finally movies that grow on you every time you watch them. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is categorized squarely within the latter, and is a truly unique and spectacularly hilarious film. The first time I saw this movie, which is directed by Shane Black who helmed the lethal weapon movies, I was impressed and satisfied but not albeit blown away, so to speak. T he next time I viewed it, I caught more of the jokes, and already knowing the plot, I was able to pay closer attention to the performances and technical aspects. The last time I viewed KKBB, I loved it, and it subsequently found its way into my top 100 films.The film features an odd narrative style, in that the narrator, Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) is aware he is narrating, and it seems to me, aware it is a film you are watching. Impossible in the context, but it works nonetheless. Because our voice from above is aware of his narration he makes quips and observations, apologizes for swearing, and then swears for forgetting to tell us something important about the story. I'm pretty sure it is impossible for Downey Jr. to give an uninteresting performance, and he is pitch-perfect here. Every joke hits home and by the end you'll be trying to remember them all so you can make yourself laugh again later. But be warned, the humour is a times dark, many hilarious sequences resulting from deaths, injuries and dismemberments. Despite being squarely in the realm of comedy there is a fantastic murder mystery and action pic mixed together. All three areas mesh seamlessly, and is one of the reasons why it is such a unique pleasure to behold.We first meet up with Harry Lockhart while in the process of robbing a toy store with his partner. When the job goes bad and he is forced to flee, he winds up tossed up with a case of mistaken identity and is jetted off to Hollywood to become an actor in a detective movie. Upon arriving he meets his tutor, a real private-eye named ""Gay Perry."" (Val Kilmer) And as he says, he's not gay ""Oh no I'm knee deep in p***y; I just liked the name so much though I'd keep it."" Before Harry can say the title of the movie he's starring Harry is thrown into a real murder mystery, involving the sister of his high school sweetheart Harmony played by Michelle Monaghan. Together the mismatched trio try to untangle the web of intrigue that unfolds before them; part buddy movie and part noir, Kilmer and Downey Jr. play off each other brilliantly; both (especially Downey Jr.) giving award worthy performances.Very minor hiccups arise relating to some confusing plot elements, but as I said they can be quickly remedied with a repeat viewing, and some overly clever jokes briefly mar any complete perfection. But with all round superb acting, the cast pulls it off flawlessly despite. Yes, KKBB is essentially perfect, but destined to be an overlooked gem, crowded out by 2005's less then perfect blockbusters, such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and the Chronicles of Narnia. So seek out this instant classic, I picked up my copy for the cost of a rental from a bargain bin, an association that is most undeserving indeed.

137,samseescinema,a film noir that strives continuously to be also a farce,9,12 December 2005,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3.5 out of 4Writer/Director Shane Black has certainly fulfilled the pre-requisite requirements for successfully creating a Crime Thriller. He wrote the Lethal Weapon series, after all. But he seems to know the genre a tad too well. With Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Black seems to have emerged on the other side of genre understanding and now looks back upon it with a disdainful eye. His film is a farce of the genre; a dirty little prank upon his previous work. It's neurotic and self-indulgent, ignorant of its own plot (a story not even the narrator approves of), and a complete laugh in the face of what the genre has come to stand for in recent years. But because of this, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (KKBB) strangely works. We find Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) as he's robbing a toy store to find a Christmas present for his son. This shopping excursion is cut short, however, when Harry's partner is incidentally shot in the getaway. Now alone and running on foot from the cops, Harry scrambles into the first room he can find, which coincidentally is a film audition for the role of a burglar who just caused the death of his partner. Fancy that. Harry gets the role, and finds himself the next day at a ritzy party in Los Angeles. There he meets Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), a homosexual private eye hired to help Harry learn the art of investigation for his upcoming role. Also at the party is Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), a girl who suspiciously looks like Harry's high school crush that got away. Later that night, Harry tags along with Perry to a stakeout that expectedly ends up in murder. I would elaborate farther, but KKBB seems about as interested with its plot as a dog is with a cat. Instead, Shane Black seems indelibly interested in his characters, a welcome change to the Crime Thriller genre of recent years. Harry introduces himself early on to be the narrator of the movie, saying that he's not all too prominent a host, but do we see any other willing narrators standing around? Thus, we're lead through the plot by a shaky, neurotic hand that jumps about on whims of flashbacks and nearly forgotten subplots. At one point, Harry promises to elaborate on a flashback, then forgets, but later remembers again and jumps back to the subplot. And as annoying as it may read on paper, the narration strangely works. Black knows his story's weaknesses, and smudges them out by allowing indulgence with Harry Lockhart's character. At particularly clichéd points in the picture, Harry stops the film on its reel (similar to how Kuzco would in my Disney favorite The Emperor's New Groove) and explains how much he hates these particular clichés in movies and apologizes at their inclusion in his own film. The irony to this method is that KKBB's plot isn't actually all too bad. It's better, in fact, than most Crime Thrillers of late. But without Harry's narration, the film would probably fall into mediocrity, even despite Black's zany characters.The most antithetical of these characters is Val Kilmer's Gay Perry. It's almost as if Black imagined the formula-based role of ""tough guy"", then decided on a character in the polar opposite direction. But he spares us the ignorant, slanderous gay men from more mediocre films; Perry won't give Harry gaudy fashion tips or speak in a lispy, high-strung tone. He's simply homosexual. Black avoids political incorrectness by making the situation funny, not the homosexuality, unwilling to allow his film to sink to low-brow gay jokes. But he's not too proud, however, to work beyond physical humor. At one point, Harmony accidentally chops part of Harry's fingers completely off. It becomes a running joke from there, with Harry departing from his phalanges on several more occasions. With such an indulgent character as Harry, Black must have toiled for hours over whom to cast for the role. Robert Downey Jr. is the fruit of these labors; and quite a delightfully sour fruit indeed. The performance is pitch perfect, Downey Jr. injecting meticulous amounts of confidence and neurotics into the assuredly unique role. There's also some welcome, and unexpected, chemistry to be found between Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan, who plays the voluptuous Harmony. I've become accustomed to complaining about a lack of chemistry between actors, only now to be completely surprised to find sparks in the most unlikely of places. But this is my feeling on the whole about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I walked in expecting little, but came away deliciously surprised. It's a film noir that strives continuously to be also a farce, but finds itself caught somewhere smarmily in between. -reviewed by Sam Osborn",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Gay Perry, Harmony Faith, and Harry Lockhart are a wonderful trio I rooted for and questioned the validity of throughout the film.
Robert Downey Jr.'s Harry Lockhart particularly is one of the most enjoyable narrators I have watched since The Narrator in Fight Club. His sarcastic meta-takes on the story keep the pace of the film up and offer clever comedic relief from a sometimes disturbing mystery. He was so impulsive and haphazard that I never knew what to expect next. Credit is also due to John Ottman for a score that matches the intensity and wit of the script.
All the while, the movie is tremendous fun. It is a sensational mystery that captures attention easier (or more easily?) than candy from the proverbial baby. I highly recommend for an age-appropriate audience.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
140,phiggins,Excellent,9,12 January 2006,"As someone who believes that Shane Black's The Long Kiss Goodnight is one of the most under-rated movies of the last ten years, I was looking forward to his new one with a certain amount of eagerness. He's well known as a writer (Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout, and, ahem, Last Action Hero) but Kiss Kiss Bang Bang would be his debut as a director, working from his own script. Even better, it would star not only Robert Downey Jr. but also Val Kilmer. Now, Kilmer is almost as under-rated as Black himself, so the whole prospect just became even more tantalising.Notice how I managed, in the previous paragraph, to casually throw in mention of several earlier movies while jokily admitting that I didn't think all of Black's works has actually been that great, thus tempering my gushing prose with a healthy dose of cynicism? Cool, huh? Notice also how I implied that I am very familiar with the work of Val Kilmer without actually mentioning any of his movies? I could have gone on about his performance in Spartan, for example, which just happens to be one of his more obscure ones, but that might have been overdoing it a little.KKBB, as those of us who refer to the titles of movies using only initials refer to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, is too clever for its own good, in a world where most movies are too stupid for their own good. This, of course, means it will die at the box-office, confuse many critics who appreciate just about anything except clever American movies, and be heartily appreciated by the rest of us.The movie tells the story of Harry, a dead-beat petty crook in New York who gets involved in, like, murder and corruption and stuff when he ends up in LA, researching an acting role against his will. Harry is a combination of movie-star cool and total ass-hole. I mean it as a compliment when I say that Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast in the role.Harry is joined by Perry, or, to give him his full name, Gay Perry. Perry, in case you haven't guessed already, is gay. He is played by Val Kilmer in somewhat bouffant mode. Perry is the coolest, sharpest character in a movie filled with cool, sharp characters. The dialogue is snappy and rude and hilarious and, best of all, audible. The direction and editing are tight and efficient without drawing attention to themselves. In other words, Black avoids almost all the pitfalls a first-time director filming his own script could plunge into headfirst. Almost all. The one mistake this movie makes is in being so knowing, so arch, so hip, so cool that it runs the risk of turning in on itself and being about nothing other than how knowing, arch, hip and cool it is. The only reason it exists is to comment on its own existence. Granted, that's one more reason than most movies have to exist, but even so.By the end of the movie, after several scenes that feel like they must be the last one but turn out not to be (how arch, how knowing, how etc) you don't really care (if you ever did) about any of the characters, or anything that has happened to anyone.But hey, who cares about caring about stuff anyway? When a film is this much fun and this fast and unpredictable, it's almost churlish to complain. KKBB will not be to everyone's taste, but that's not my problem. I loved every minute of it, even the bits that didn't really work and the bits that seemed out of place.I'm having trouble finishing this thing now. Need to sign off with a memorable little summation of my feelings about the film, or a little quip or something, or maybe I'll just",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
141,TheGreatMarkukini,Kiss the logic goodbye,8,7 March 2019,"If you came unprepared as I, your brows might rise almost to a hairline and stay there until forced down with hands. The narration starts deceptively welcoming as an assistant in a hardware store passionately telling about an instrument and suddenly pulling out a gigantic rattling chainsaw shaking your reception of reality.Up to an undefined point in the plot I understood one thing that simply changed its direction without any note of warning further into movie. The only fact I am sure of is the crazy entertaining noire style of story delivery; the trio of Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan slaps a viewer with a back of a hand doing one hell of a ballet reverse. The situations are so outlandish and simultaneously normal that a feeling of being stretched by horses ""medieval way"" is never leaving you and you wonder whether this self-flagellation mood is one of the best things that you have experienced.I don't know how I can clearly express emotions after seeing the picture; I think it is not possible because it is a tangled bell of fascination, shock, laughter, thrill and simple enjoyment.

142,writenamehere,A rare kind of authenticity,10,5 September 2021,"It wouldn't be possible to make this film anymore. The characters occupy a space that is ideologically verboten - that is, they behave and engage with their world as you'd expect such a person to in real life. This makes them seem callous, cold, and self interested, and at the same time capable of progressing to something ""better"", but in their own way. They are not distorted to become a convenient imprint of popular politics.The remarkable feature about the style of this film is that it uses only enough of what might be called an excess, and never pushes it to gratuitous levels for entertainment sake. Everything is either for the sake of telling the story, or due to the limitations of the character. I don't know what genre of film this is, because it is literally an expression of Film.How would a character based on a 1960's paper back private-eye appear in a modern day city? Not too dissimilar to what they have created here, I imagine. Robert Downey Jnr was perfect for the lead role, and the trinity of Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan completes a perfect cast. I wouldn't watch this twice for fun, it isn't that kind of special. I would recommend everyone watches it at least once, to see what can be done when a film maker appreciates, and has the courage, to use all of the space available to the characters.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
143,JimD73,Great potential sleeper hit,8,9 September 2006,"Some movies like to wink at the audience, dropping little hints that they know they're clichéd and ridiculous and that they really don't care. Blend that little bit of wink-wink-nudge-nudge, blow it up to one-hundred times the size and throw in a hint of Get Shorty and you get Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the directorial debut of the writer of Lethal Weapon. It may be riddled with plot holes, but the movie is fun enough to watch that it can easily be recommended.Like any movie of the type, KKBB opens up with an extremely lucky coincidence. Harry Lockhart (Downey) is on the runs from the cops after a toy store robbery is botched and his partner is killed. He stumbles upon an open audition for a movie and hides there, actually impressing agent Dabney Shaw (Miller) with his acting abilities. He is flown out to L.A., where he is set up to have detective lessons with consultant Perry Van Shrike, aka Gay Perry (Kilmer), to help get him acquainted with the role. At the same party where he meets Perry, Harry also finds an old school crush, Harmony Faith Lane (Monaghan), now a struggling actress.The next night, Perry brings Harry along to show him some PI work, but the two end up finding a body stashed in the trunk of a sinking car. After their attempted rescue gets botched, Harry goes back to his apartment to find Harmony at the door. Apparently, her sister committed suicide and she, under the impression Harry is a PI, hires him to investigate. Like any good mystery, Harmony's sister and the body in the trunk are connected, and Harry, Perry and Harmony are left to sort it out.While the set up is good, the case is incredibly muddled. It has so many twists and turns that it is almost impossible to follow. This could work in the movie's favour, but the fact is that there are many times where the characters seem to think they have it solved despite the fact that even the dumbest members of the audience can see that they aren't even close. Even after you take the time to understand the whole thing, there are plenty of plot holes that keep the movie from making much sense at all.While the plot does have a lot of contrivances, that is entirely forgivable in this movie due to the excellent style. Downey narrates the movie in character as Lockhart, telling it like he was trying to just tell the story to a friend. He doesn't want suspense or surprises, actually pausing the movie to point out the clichés as they pop up, such as having the bad guy shown early on or a character magically being resurrected in the end. The whole self-ridiculing nature of the movie is what sets it apart from other movies like it, making it funny and refreshing instead of frustrating and confusing.Unfortunately, the middle of the movie loses the narration for some reason, which makes parts of it relatively dry. However, even without the narration the movie isn't lost comedically. The script is quite clever, managing to still poke fun at the thriller clichés even without the voice-over, especially in one hilarious scene involving Russian Roulette. Throw in plenty of great lines from Gay Perry and the movies manages to be consistently funny throughout.The acting in the movie also holds strong. Downey seems to be channelling Dustin Hoffman as the big mouth idiot narrator. Monaghan is more than cute enough for the female lead, and plays the smart and desperate angle very well. Kilmer is the real standout, in a completely unexpected turn as Gay Perry. He's incredibly funny whenever he puts Harry back in his place, and also believable as a tough detective with just that little bit of queerness. While a lot of the other characters are wasted, the main three are more than able to carry the movie.Despite gaping plot holes and plenty of confusing moments that may or may not get resolved, KKBB is still a very entertaining movie. It's funny, it has style and it has a gay Val Kilmer. It may not quite be Get Shorty, but it is still definitely worth a look. Since apparently no one has ever heard of it, do yourself a favour and give it a shot, and if you like it spread the worth. Nothing like a sleeper hit to make the world feel better.84%",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
144,Movieguy_blogs_com,"This movie keeps the laughs coming, everything thing from obvious vulgarity to subtle humor.",10,11 November 2005,"In 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' Robert Downey Jr plays Harry Lockhart, a lowlife criminal turned actor when he accidentally stumbles in on an audition while trying to escape the police. To prepare for a role Harry teams up with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), a private investigator who is supposed to show Harry what it is like. What is supposed to be an easy assignment turns out to be a complicated murder mystery (with a lot of laughs).This is probably on of the best written scripts I have seen. This movie keeps the laughs coming, everything thing from obvious vulgarity to subtle humor. Both Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer are superb. It is so good and original that I cannot think of anything that compares.My only complaint about this movie is that because you are trying to catch all the jokes, the plot becomes a little hard to follow.

The ""cleverness"" wore us down within ten minutes and the visual style, if that's the appropriate word, reminds one of smart, hip, just graduated film kids who have yet to learn how to replace the cleverness of the incessant movement of everything visual, coupled with the destruction of a well made story by even more cleverness (""look at me, the director!"")by, well, creating more mature movies. That takes time and not all of the best and brightest get there. But what is one to say of Shane Black? He supposedly left the major leagues some time ago, being burned out by the cosmos-sized dreck he had been writing. I presume his return to Hollywood with KKBB was supposed to be an answer as the kind of movie he really wanted to make all along. But what it displays, instead, is how mired he is in superficiality. I do wish him well however. At 46, he's got to be experiencing some kind of mid-life crisis and perhaps this passage will give him the time to examine not just his life but life itself. He's certainly positioned to do at least one, if not more, very good movies.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I was always reluctant to watch this because of the quirky title as it doesn't do the film justice or tell you what it is about but rest assured you'll be in for a good time.

147,robertmaybeth,"This is a move you have to wrap your head around to enjoy first,",8,14 October 2018,"And for some viewers that takes multiple viewings. When Kilmer and Downey are on-screen, it is great - it flows along on its own momentum through the great interchanges between the characters. But when the pace winds down, as it does far too many times, the story slows down too much with uninteresting plot points and seems to trip over its own feet, bound in a sort of self-serving plot-muck leading to an uneven and unrewarding payoff at the end. Robert Downey is great, but uneven in this story and you find yourself looking forward to the interchange he has between Val Kilmer's private detective character. Its a fine dynamic, and Kilmer is really at his very best here: The two have a low-key hostility as Kilmer mildly resents having to drag along Downey - and Kilmer's comebacks, insults and comments are perfect, as is Downey's reaction to them. The parley that Kilmer and Downey share is the most entertaining part of the movie, and the rest of the story simply falls flat when it isn't happening. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer or Downey this movie is not to be missed - they are both at their best here and their rapport is the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The rest of the story is unremarkable, convoluted, and illogical, so I found the rewatch much more enjoyable, since I knew what to expect first.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

There is a new, miseducated, narcissistic, low-brow class of sheep that literally know nothing about history, or anything else. But they believe they are the best and brightest and they write these films, pay for these films, and write positive reviews..They think they are special but they are the ones we roll our eyes at. This is not ""film noir."" It is not ""dark comedy."" It is not clever, witty, or insightful. It is repulsive. The few who fell over themselves laughing and winking in the mirror are the ones who think the f word is hilarious. All you have to do is put it in every sentence and suddenly, miraculously you have wit. Not just wit but brilliant wit. A timeless classic has just been created. They are truly so dull and shallow, they are far too stupid to know how really stupid they are. They will never know. But now I know the reason wit and great comedy has died.If you want to raise the level of hilarity you add a lot of s**t, pee and tit phrases to the script. Now you are talking about really big laughs. I could not even crack a smile during any of this film. It is a Robert Downey clown show.If you want to have a good evening and watch black comedy, with wit, and lots of pathos watch ""A New Leaf,"" with Walter Mathau from 1971.

Viewing this movie for the first time while watching many other more recently released RDJ movies, it is clear to see how fantastic of an actor he is and how compelling he is as he demands attention with every word or action he projects. On the flip-side of things, he as the narrator made me laugh on multiple occasions... Comparing 'The Nice Guys' to 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', this film easily beats 'The Nice Guys' out in my book where I simply found this far more entertaining than it.A very comedic and compelling film for your viewing pleasure.

150,98nurdinm-1,Lethal Weapon Indeed,6,19 March 2006,"""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" heralds the triumphant return of three people to the mainstream film world. The first is writer/director Shane Black, him of ""Lethal Weapon"" fame. The second is Val Kilmer, returning home to the decent roles after so many slow years. The third, and perhaps most notable, is Robert Downey Jr's return.In the role of Harry, Downey Jr looks and sounds perfect. At first a little cocky, confident, it isn't long before the script - and Downey Jr - begin to unravel the hidden depths to the character quite superbly. His small-time crook, mistaken for a credible actor, taken to LA where he is teamed up with Kilmer's Gay Perry - name speaks for itself - a private detective to do some background research in the method style so favoured by many top Hollywood performers.It is a very fast beginning - you start at the party, then bam! you're at the toy shop Harry is trying to rob, then bam! you're in the auditions and then bam! you're back at the party. The script is like this all the way through - fast, slick and, like many decent noir films, something you have to stay awake for. Otherwise you are going to be running around like a headless turkey trying to keep up with all the twists and turns. In fact, might I suggest subtitles with your first viewing? Though they may obscure the viewer of the presence of the gorgeous Michelle Monaghan, who plays Harmony, an old friend of Harry's who, mistaking him for a real private eye, initially asks him to look into the apparent suicide of her little sister. Not only is she very beautiful, Monaghan is also a terrific actress, and she and Downey Jr make quite a good couple.Val Kilmer is an actor whom I have never been very keen on in the past, but in this film he excels himself. In fact, and this is with no offence intended to anyone, he is the straightest gay guy I've ever seen on the big screen. He also delivers some killer lines, thanks to the great script that Shane Black has provided.This is not a laugh out loud comedy. There were very few moments where you felt the need to laugh more than a titter or have a knowing grin on your chops. But I think that it is best to watch it a couple of times - as mentioned before, the script is very fast and you must keep up with it - so try that in your first viewing and then try and look out for any really good gags in your second.It's not a comedy, though; there are very gritty scenes involved, most of which seems to happen to poor Harry - one in particular involving electrodes made me wince, as would probably any man watching. It's a stylish neo-thriller, but with a buddy relationship thrown in alongside a feisty female to spice up the cocktail. That was in no way a pun on Gay Perry, by the way.6/10",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

152,cleary-joshua,"Smart, Blackly Comic, and Very Violent",7,20 June 2013,"Shane Black's directorial debut, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is smart, blackly comic and very violent. Starring and narrated by Robert Downey Jr., it gives a unique take on what seems like an ordinary detective story with its self-referential humour and gripping action. The narration itself is done by the main character, Harry Lockhart, and it is done as if he is telling the story personally to you, often correcting himself or commenting as to how bad a narrator he is. The film suddenly halts in numerous places, much like film stopping in a projector, and Lockhart backtracks to previous parts of the film or makes sure the audience knows what is going on by explaining things in a way that is comical, not patronising. Thankfully, it in no way overuses this, preventing the film from becoming overly stunted. One of the other successful parts of this narrative technique is that Lockhart comments on storytelling and the act of watching a film itself. He assures the audience that the ending will be nothing like the end of ""Lord of the Rings"", and asks if the audience have ""worked it out yet"".Val Kilmer is well cast as 'Gay' Perry, and the rest of the supporting cast are very good as well, providing a lot of the laughs. There is a particularly fantastic scene early in the film where Lockhart continues to spot other-race versions of celebrities (Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton is my personal favourite), and this just shows how well written the dialogue for the film really is. It's also comically gruesome, with a lot of bloodshed, a finger getting repeatedly cut off, and one very darkly comic moment where Lockhart accidentally urinates on a corpse.However, it left me feeling slightly unfulfilled at the end, due to the final 15 or so minutes of the movie. The explanation to the whole case is wrapped up very nicely towards the end, before the final shoot out. But when Lockhart then wakes up in hospital, the miraculously alive Perry tells him that this is not the case, which feels a bit pointless, seeing as the first explanation was perfectly good. This leads to a final scene where Perry ends up beating a hospital bed-bound old man, which feels very gratuitous and completely unnecessary, despite the old man's previous actions. I also wasn't happy with the very final scene where it is revealed that Lockhart now works for Perry, and has been narrating the story via some kind of webcam. Why not just leave the film without, as Lockhart says, ""wrapping the movie up""? It takes the self-referential feeling a bit too far, and while it is still funny, seems like it's trying to give a ""they all lived happily ever after"" sense to the end, contrasting the tone of the rest of the film.It doesn't completely ruin it, and the whole film is still worth watching, with its clever narrative, sharp dialogue and gorily funny plot.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I rushed to see it because of its Shane Black pedigree, but unfortunately it looks as if that's the same reason it got a green light with the script in the amorphous state that it was. Robert Downey is unconvincing as a crook, unconvincing as a lover and - strangely, given the movie's plot - unconvincing as an actor. Val Kilmer is likable as Gay Perry but he's really just an excuse to throw a bunch of gay jokes around. In fact, the film comes off as an excuse to be gratuitously funny and cannibalistic re Hollywood. It's so self-consciously knowing, that our suspension of disbelief is constantly undermined so we can supposedly smile at tricks like the film stopping while the narrator tells you something he left out of the story earlier. The movie could still work, except for the fact that Shane Black keeps losing sight of the story. Not surprising - it's monstrously complicated and tenuous. But Black prefers to enjoy himself with wacky scenes and dialogue that have nothing to do with the plot, rather than get on with the driving force of the movie, which is therefore almost completely lost. I was just hanging on by the end, and the fact that characters had to keep telling each other what had happened, seemed to show that I was not the only one. This movie isn't horrible and there are some nice original touches and some funny lines, but as a whole it doesn't hang together, and you get the feeling it was missing a strong producer who could tell the writer of Lethal Weapon when he was getting too self-indulgent. Having said that, I'm all for writers finally being allowed to take control of their 'babies' - it's just a pity that someone who is so deserving of that opportunity has blown it - thus opening the door for more faceless, minimal talent directors to hack at good material in the fond belief that writers don't know what's good for their own movies.

162,Troy2Slick,Very Funny Movie!,10,22 June 2006,"I had never heard of this movie until I stumbled upon it at my local Blockbuster the other night. I've always been a Robert Downey and Val Kilmer fan, so this was right up my alley.Not only was it a sensational piece of work, but it was one of the funniest flicks that I had come across in quite some time. The style of humor is dark, but it's not distasteful at all. If you are a fan of crime movies and twists and turns, then I suggest you take a gander at this fine film.It will definitely be a movie that will be added to my already extensive collection soon.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
163,shiftyeyeddog,Triple Comeback,8,5 July 2007,"I was very excited to see this movie. It was a much-needed comeback for three people: Writer/director Shane Black (writer of the Lethal Weapons, Last Boyscout, etc.), Val Kilmer, and Robert Downey Jr. I had high hopes, and was not disappointed.It felt very much like a Black script, the usual kind of convoluted conspiracy plot, with just the right balance of action and humor. This one was really more of a comedy with just some action moments. I found myself laughing out loud during several scenes. Michelle Monaghan, the female lead, always reminded me of a cross between Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler, yet strangely I liked her, whereas I don't care for those other two. Kilmer was fine, but the standout here is Downey. He is hilarious, and I was reminded what a great actor he can really be - not just in comedy, but he does some good dramatic stuff here as well. I really hope Downey can keep clean this time around, because he's too talented to just waste it away on drugs. This has made me wanna go back and watch a lot of his previous stuff, both ones I've seen and some I haven't.A fun movie, for sure, and I will definitely be seeing this one again.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
164,Craig-9,I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time,9,1 November 2005,"I wasn't sure what to make of the movie at first. The opening sequences are almost a bit too much, with the story stopping and starting and reversing and Robert Downey's narration seeming a bit arch. But then it settles into a groove and becomes one of the funniest and most entertaining films I've seen in quite awhile. I've never been a huge fan of Downey, but here his sarcastic persona really fits the role, that of a low level thief turned actor turned apprentice detective. His snarky comments fit the movie and its allusions to pulp detective fiction perfectly. Val Kilmer is another actor that I haven't always liked, yet he, too, is great in the role of a gay private detective, underplaying and very funny at the same time. At times, the movie reminded me of The Last Boy Scout, one of Black's earlier screenplays and a dark movie that I absolutely hated, unrelieved by even a hint of comic relief. But every time this movie threatened to go in that direction, it would pull back and lighten up. Ultimately, it was a great ride and I would love to see these characters back in action again. Sequel, anyone?",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
165,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,Not as smart and witty as it thinks it is.,7,29 January 2014,"A smart, witty mob comedy that isn't quite as smart and witty as it thinks it is. Robert Downey Jr. plays petty thief Harry Lockhart who gets caught up in a murder investigation by posing as an actor and heading to Los Angeles for an unlikely audition, where he finds an authentic acting coach in detective Perry Van Shrike played by Val Kilmer. Lockhart accompanies Perry on night in order research for a role as a detective. When the two men stumble upon the dead body of a woman, all hell breaks loose. Soon the two men are on the run from the mob and need to figure out what the heck is going on. Unfortunately, the plot is so muddled, we never fully understand what's going on. Thankfully, Kiss Kiss has enough comedy and chemistry between the two leads to make it work. Downey Jr. is perfect as a fast talking thief turned ""actor"" and Val Kilmer is nicely cast as the tough guy with a secret. Another interesting part of the film is how Downey Jr. routinely breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the viewer. I know it's kind of been over used in film and TV in recent years, but it works here. In the end, I enjoyed Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang for it's snappy dialogue and the buddy comedy all wrapped in a mob noir taco, I just would have liked the plot to be a little more coherent. I didn't really care who the murderer was and why they did it. To me that's a problem. A good film, just not a great one.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

167,zerogirl42,I Couldn't Stop Laughing,10,30 March 2006,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang cleverly weaves together film noir and black comedy to create an edge-of-your-seat thriller/mystery. This seems like a lot to tackle, but somehow the film works and works very well.When I saw the trailer I thought this was going to be a whole story based on Robert Downey Jr. hiding his true identity. This is not so. This is just where the story begins. I'm so tired of trailers giving away the entire story. That doesn't happen in KKBB. The story gets quite complex and leads you on quite a ride. In fact, the pacing is like an adult version of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyland. Tons of surprises and clever humor puts this on par with the best comedies I've ever seen. There's some very creative editing and fun narration which would normally get on my nerves (I hate the voice-over that over explains everything), but instead it really adds a nice dimension to understand how Harry, the lead character, perceives what's happening around him.There's a lot of poking fun at the entertainment industry in LA. The lead actress is an aging starlet. Having lived in LA myself, I have to say the observations of the culture there are dead on.Having been a teenager in the 1980s, it's quite refreshing to see some of the old heart-throbs of my youth becoming seasoned actors. Kilmar plays against type as a gay detective and Downey plays Harry, a good guy who ultimately makes some of THE WORST decisions. Downey expresses quite a range in this film. I found myself rooting for all the lead actors.You have to be awake to enjoy this film. The high energy, subtle hints and quick dialog requires attention to catch everything. I didn't find it draining though. I just wanted to make sure that I caught all the humor because it was so funny. I laughed about as much as when I saw the 40-year-old virgin, but this is anything but a sex story.(Possible spoiler here to give an example of the comedy) There's a bunch of clever comedy and I was quite amused by the poking fun at a Star Wars ending (I'm referring to the end of episode 6 when all the ghosts are there and well at the end). I'm not going into anymore detail except that Abe Lincoln being in the film actually worked!There's a classic, but unfortunately truthful line about aspiring actresses in LA all being from other places. Harry says, ""I swear to God, it's like somebody took America by the East Coast, and shook it, and all the normal girls managed to hang on."" (end of spoiler)",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
168,spooly_montana,Sharp Comedy!,9,22 May 2007,"KISS KISS BANG BANG is a highly original dark comedy brought to you from the writer of the Lethal Weapon films. This is Shane Black's utterly impressive directorial debut starring Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and co-starring Michelle Monaghan. Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) is a thief who is running from the police immediately after a botched store break-in, stumbling into a film audition unexpectedly. Harry is the film's anti-hero and narrator. Harry wows them with his intense ""method acting"" brought out (unknowingly to the directors) by the script thrust into his hands upon entering the room. Just like the written dialogue he reads from the pages, his partner was also shot in a break in that had just went horribly wrong. While Harry is worked up and kneeling in front of the directors, a cop hot on Harry's tail bursts into the room. The policeman mistakes him for an actor, wishes him luck and then departs. The previous scene lets you in on what you can expect with the viewing of 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'; and that is that you do not really know what to expect. Therein lies the real magic of this film. As a narrator, Harry freezes the reel of the film a couple times to poke fun at the film and to critique his performance as a narrator. As a thief, disguised as an actor, Harry gets tips from Private Eye Consultant, Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), on how to act the part for the film. Harry tells various girls he meets in the L.A. bars that he is a private eye, receiving a lackluster reaction. No doubt they all wished he was a director. By pure chance Harry runs into Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), a girl he was in love with in the small Indiana town where they grew up together. She was 16 when she took a bus to California to be a star. At age 34, she has not yet accomplished that dream, besides a small spot in a beer commercial. Harmony is suspicious of her sister's sudden suicide, and beseeches Harry to help her find out the truth. We are along for the twists and turns of the case that Harry, Gay Perry, and Harmony are officially not supposed to be involved in. Downey and Kilmer are a dynamite comedic duo! Their performances will stick you to your seat with laughter, in 103 minutes of exceptionally sharp writing by director Shane Black. To say Shane Black shows promise his first time out as director, is an understatement. It's like stating that Orson Welles made a modest debut as director with his iconic film classic 'Citizen Kane'. Many movies in film history have had great writing, but with poor direction, the potential is lost in the film-making process. Under Black's direction, this independent noir comedy achieves its potential as a laugh-out-loud original work. Through some online research I discovered that the term ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" was first coined in the 1960s by the Japanese press as a nickname for James Bond. Writer/Director Shane Black loved the term and chose it as the movie's title because, ""it so clearly represented what this film is."" From the opening of 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' until the end, you are in store for an original gold nugget of cinema.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I decided to take a risk and watch this on Amazon Prime. I'm not sorry I did. You have a narrator who purposely can't narrate his own story (Downey Jr), Val Kilmer (underrated in my opinion), and the female lead. In the woman they did not make her a bimbo except when it was in her best interest to appear this way. The sexual themes were there but didn't slow down the plot long enough to get that soda refill in the theater.So many things had me laughing out loud but the scene of the dog taking an item from the ice was one of my favorites.This isn't a full laugh out loud movie, although it has its times.

The film-makers of this movie knew this was a piece of crap. However, this is a fine piece of crap. Robert Downey is in fact a fine actor. I hate this movie. Just my opinion. It is a fine work of art. It is a sad disgrace upon humanity. Robert Downey is a unique and fine actor. Do I have to continue? Robert Downey is in fact a far above average actor. This movie is visually outstanding. okay, Michelle Monaghan is beautiful and competent. 4 more lines to go. Val Kilmer plays a gay guy who is not ""too gay"". I think Val Kilmer should be proud of that. For some reason. ""Val Kilmer was not too gay"". Val Kilmer was ""just gay enough"". There's a resume for an actor. All the bad guys were found out.

I'll start with the positives. The movie is beautifully shot and is visually compelling. The party scenes and shots at the Standard Hotel were great. RDJ has always been one of my favorite actors, and he shines in this. I would struggle to think of a film where he gave a bad performance because he is just so talented. Val Kilmer and Corbin Bernsen were terrific too. The story has some good twists and the action is pretty non stop.On the negative side, I'd have to say the movie is pretty formulaic despite above mentioned ""twists."" It's not a compelling film and I think it could have been. The female lead was terrible. Yes, she's stunning, but her acting is bad bad bad. She ruined every scene she was in and I found her unwatchable.I guess I wouldn't recommend it. RDJ has had better movies - watch one of them instead.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Downey plays Harry Lockhart a thief who stumbles into a screen test for a Hollywood producer.The casting crew thinks he is just actors so take him to Hollywood to star in their next picture.Corbin Bernsen plays Harlan Dexter a fading actor who's biggest hit was based on books read by Harmony Lane (Monaghan).She get's invited to Dexter's party, possibly for her resemblance to his daughter.Val Klimer plays Gay Perry. As usual, Klimer plays his parts well.Perry is there to meet Harry Lockhart and then show him the ropes of private investigator.On the next day, they become involved in a murder and holy hell is turned loose.I had to watch this like twice because it is very fast paced.

For films that know they are films, the Road pictures of Hope and Crosby were much more sprightly and spontaneous. For upending of genres, what's the point. There are ridiculous private eye pictures, and great ones, and the great ones hardly need skewering, and even the mediocre ones have more of a point than this frantic rambling of whispered comebacks. And here comes a spoiler: spotted even before I left this babbling baby: Downey and his girl are the same age, supposedly. Well 43 or 45 whatever his makeup is trying hard to hide sure ain't 28 or 33, unless that's the new math.But if you want somebody telling you this is a great one, there's plenty here for that.

The thing that makes this different from the others is that Shane Black actually takes the clichés of those films and turns it on its head. The cast all do a wonderful job especially Robert Downey Jr, Val Kilmer, and Michelle Monaghan. They have terrific chemistry and help portray their characters as likable and quirky. The script is one of a kind from Shane and very underrated just like a lot of Shane's work. His movies deserve to be talked about and not just pushed to the side. My only issue with the film and why it gets an 8 is the lack of screen time for the villain. He is very underdeveloped and that's the only thing disappointing because most of Black's villain are at least developed or have a personality which this villain lacked because of the limited screen time that he got.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a perfect example of how to be clever with its story whether it's a buddy film, a black comedy, or a thriller.

178,Syrchek,SeX. MurdEr. MyStery. Welcome to the...... hardly.,7,15 March 2006,"OK, the mystery starts to unfold itself at a classy party where there are lots of young actresses and wannabe ones to. From the beginning we are experiencing it all with Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.). It's one of those movies with a narrator. Therefor we hear his voice explaining to us how and why he got here. It's quickly clear that Harry is just a plain crook who steals toys in supermarkets in the middle of the night. He had no intention in coming to this party. He's just a guy who goes wherever the wind blows. Actually he's here because he is auditioning for a role of a detective, but he doesn't really care about it. At the party he meets detective Perry Van Shrike (Val Kilmer), Gay Perry for close friends. He is supposed to be his tutor for the role. Here they get a glimpse into who are the big shots that are running the game at this party.Later they get involved in a few suspicious events and therefor start to investigate them with their own hands. OK, so much for the rough guide to this movie. If I try to classify Kiss Kiss Bang Bang I would say it's a tragic/comical neo-noir. I felt like I was watching a movie about a movie, so nothing seemed too serious. I usually like the narrating concept, but only if it's on solid ground and therefor enriches the story. That didn't happen this time. Downey tried to be too funny, instead he made the concept look kind of dated. The jokes and one-liners didn't seem to have a full effect on me because they were mostly served too fast. Luckaly the director/screenwriter knew how to put in a few funny incidents that didn't depend on dialogs. The good side are the minor action scenes that gave true edge and contributed to authenticity. Generally I liked the film and the word 'hardly' in my comment may wrongly suggest the opposite. 'Hardly' stands for it hardly fits my expectations when the majority of voters gave it a 9 or a 10. I expected a lot more from it. It's an above average crime/mystery that made me laugh a few times and also drove me in the attempt to unravel the plot.

180,jdgan,More like Kiss Slap Bang Ow.,5,7 November 2020,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang honestly just disappointed me. And this is coming from someone who watched and loved The Nice Guys. I watched this film, hearing that this was a better film and an underrated gem. It wasn't.Robert Downey Jr (before he was Iron Man) stars as Harry Lockhart, a New York City thief. A toy store robbery on Christmas ends with the alarm going off, his partner being shot and Harry stumbling into an audition. He unknowingly nails it and is sent to an LA party before an upcoming screen test. What follows is a crime film involving a severed finger, pitch black comedy, and a corpse.Robert Downey Jr does pull off a great performance in the movie as well as Val Kilmer, but to be honest, I couldn't really buy the relationship between the two because they spend most of the movie bickering even after the movie ends. Michelle Monaghan was also a pretty good performance.That being said, I couldn't really care for the characters that much. Right from the beginning, Harry is presented as a guy who's just been given a second chance, which is a good and interesting route to take. To make matters even better, he reunites with an old friend that he met as a kid and it's building up to a great relationship. Aaaand then, the movie ruins that by having him sleep with her friend instead. It was around that point that I just stopped caring about him. He isn't a womaniser, he was dead set on Harmony the moment he laid eyes on her so that just felt out of character in my opinion. The worst bit is that the film treats the entire scenario like a joke since he wakes up and expects to see Harmony but instead sees the friend instead like this is the first time he's seen her. For many reasons, the scene just doesn't work in my opinion. Now compare Harry Lockhart to Holland March from The Nice Guys. He's presented as a down-on-his-luck, self-hating private eye who's tasked with finding a missing girl. He's also caring for his daughter alone as well as his wife had died in a house fire that destroyed his old house. He also subverts our expectations as he isn't a deadbeat dad despite her daughter having some resentment against March for the fire. See the difference? One is relatable and we care about him. The other, not so much.I didn't find the film as funny as other people were saying. For me, it mostly consisted of constant bickering and the pratfalls of Harry. He goes through a lot in this film as he's not only berated but he's also lost his finger, gotten electrocuted, and tortured. What ruins this is that the film plays almost all of it for the laughs.Which brings me to my next issue with the film and what the films could have used more of. Heart. I get that this is a black comedy but even the best black comedies have some resemblance of a heart. This film had not and played most of the scenes like a joke. So much in fact that when a serious scene came up, I was expecting a joke.One scene however, was incredibly well done. At one point in the film, Harry witnesses a girl being shot by one of the kidnappers. Looking downright broken and empty he shoots the guy without saying anything. It was honestly the best scene in the movie for me and honestly, the film could have used slightly more of those kind of scenes to balance out the tone.The cinematography was also pretty good as well as the score. But that was about it.In conclusion, this was not an underrated gem. This was just a tonal mess of a promising script that needed another edit and a rewrite.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Mostly ""Leathal Weapon"" his most known movie that he wrote.

RObert Downey Jr. does great here. he plays the small time crook trying to pass as an actor brilliantly, he has that cluelessness about him at one minute and another he looks like a leading man. He just pulled it off nicely for his role.

Its a toss up which performance I liked better, him in Tombstone as Doc Holliday or him in The Doors as Jim Morrison. Both should have been nominated for an Academy Awards or southing! But Kilmer really shines here, he plays a gay private eye detective, and he sure did pull it off, from the things that he said, to the way he looked at people, to the way he walked to the way he dressed he just embodied that character. He was really quite funny, I forgot that he could do the comedic element so well. His chemistry with Downey Jr was great as they bullied each other back in forth with their banter. Just like in every Shane Black movie, there is a lot of quick, sharp, and solid dialog that doesn't let up. Its a good satire of Hollywood, mostly true, mostly very funny cliché type things, with a good narrative from Downey Jr.Great action/thriller, with twist and turns but not to many to leave you clueless. If you liked Last Boy Scout and Long Kiss Goodnight, you will like this movie. It doesn't have as much action as those 2 but it has enough to keep you watching. Its more of a action/comedy/mystery/thriller more than anything else. One of the better movies I've seen in the last few months. Keep it real and until the next review",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
189,keuhkokala,This movie spoke to me. Literally.,8,30 September 2005,"Funny title for a movie. It must've come from some Japanese accompanions, because the legend says, the Japanese have a nickname for James Bond and that is Mr. Kiss-kiss-bang-bang.I was surprised to see an American movie that feels fresh. That hadn't happened for a while, as nowadays most American movies are based on something else such as a comic book, a novel, a video game or even another movie. Kiss kiss, bang bang in fact plays with our expectations of a movie. It's a kind of parody from old crime movies. If it resembles anything, it is the movies by the Coen brothers like the Big Lebowski. And we're still far off.What makes this film so special, then? Well, the fact that it knows that it's a movie. The narrator voice tells us so, frequently. And makes some killer jokes from it. And itself. Other than that, the movie's kind of realistic. How can a movie joke about itself and still be realistic, you ask? Wellm for instance, the characters make mistakes all the time. And I don't mean the I-can't-tell-the-truth-so-I-will-make-up-this-ridiculous-story kind of mistakes you see on sitcoms. I mean bad luck mistakes. Like falling down, when you're running to prevent an assassination. Or accidentally killing someone you were about to threaten with your gun. And like Lebowski, one severed body part travels around.One hopes that Robert Downey, Jr., who has just risen from the rock bottom, would start to get some good roles after this. The movie is as fun as anything by Tarantino, so I think we have good chance of that.**** The best part (minor SPOILER): Going to the bathroom and discovering a corpse",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
190,cwx,Mainstream evolution,8,7 August 2006,"What a shame this film didn't get a real wide release, because it seems like with some real promotion and distribution, this might really have caught on. Here you have a seemingly worn-out premise, the buddy/romance/detective picture, somehow brought to new life with just the right flavor of wit. Writer-director Shane Black was responsible for writing the Lethal Weapon series (I only saw the fourth one and some of the many imitators), and it seems like this movie is about as revolutionary (from what I've heard of the original) in attempting to rejuvenate the genre too bad nobody is ready for that anymore nowadays.Robert Downey, Jr. and Michelle Monaghan are quite formidable here (in different ways), while Val Kilmer is more just okay, although his gay detective character is great anyway. Downey narrates the whole film (as his character, but also as a ""narrator) and his commentary is mostly hilarious, although there are a few moments of meta that fall flat (and that must be saying something considering how much I love meta). The plot is convoluted, but it sets off the difference between ""fantasy"" and ""reality"" in a much more creative and even insightful way than how these films usually present outlandish events while impotently asserting their verité. It's not perfect, but I do feel vindicated in my constant protests that mainstream film doesn't have to be the thoughtless swamp of nonsense that it usually is now. The experiment doesn't always work, but overall this film is meant to entertain and succeeds; are you really telling me that it was ""too challenging"" for the average moviegoer?",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
191,TomCruiseFan99,One of the funniest thrillers ever,10,23 April 2008,"Brilliant! That's the first attribute that comes to mind after watching this truly original zinger of a film. The script may be complex, but that just means you get to sit through it quite a few times to enjoy it all the more. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer give the performances of their lives, as unlikely partners trying to solve a murder mystery. Their rapid dialogue is filled to the brim with zippy wisecracks and hilarious one-liners. And their screen chemistry is undeniable.Shane Black makes his directing debut here, after writing action classics like Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout, and he is essentially paying homage to the film-noir detective classics of the 40's and 50's, albeit with quite a few modern twists. And he definitely pulls it off, making this one of the most original films since The Usual Suspects.A terrific cast, an excitingly involving plot, and a director who's a master of the genre - all the ingredients for a true classic. Definitely one for your collection.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
192,DoubleOscar,This Movie was Made for Me,9,21 May 2015,"This movie was fantastic, it felt like it was speaking directly to me. First off, I love dark comedy, this movie is glowing with amazing humor. Second, I am a huge Film Noir guy, and this is a great twist on that. Lastly, I love films that are self aware and play off of that a little bit. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang does these all spectacularly.The performances were off the charts, specifically Val Kilmer who was unexpectedly great in this movie, but very welcome. Robert Downey Jr. was great in one of his comeback roles and constantly had me laughing. Lastly, Michelle Monaghan was fantastic and had great chemistry with both Downey Jr. and Kilmer.My only complaint is that the story felt a tiny bit jumbled at places, but I feel that those problems will be cleared up upon a second viewing, which I intend to do. I do feel the replay value on this film is incredible. The twists and turns taken are never stale and the humor is one of the best I have seen in a while.Overall, this film is HUGELY underrated and I highly suggest checking it out. The confidence of the film bleeds off the screen (In a good way) and there is never a moment of slowness due to the perfect narration of Robert Downey Jr. This is definitely a film not to be missed.""Uh, I'm retired.

Robert Downey Jr. Hillariously mucks up a robbery and sees his partner die, then stumbles into an audition, in which the character's partner has just been killed in front of him, and surprise surprise, he acts like it's real and gets the part. From here on in Harry (Downey Jr.) and his childhood friend, who is interlocking by destiney withhis story, go through murder, deception, fraud and other times with hilarious consequences, like when a body turns up in their hotel room as a sting, in order to get rid of the corpse they chuck it off the top of the roof, causing it to nearly miss a dumpster, obviously breaking bones.

Harry is the narrator of the story and the initial few minutes, your curiosity is piqued with a touch of impatience as you wonder where the story is going. Then it is rather a quirky, thrill seeking ride of the unexpected.The core plot runs a bit like a standard murder/ mystery thriller surrounded by Saturday Night Live type side sketches. Most of these were verging on bad taste, but my husband and I found them hilarious. At times, I think we were the only people in the cinema laughing. Case in point is a scene with a dog chewing on something that belongs to Harry.Not Oscar winning stuff, but a nice change from the mainstream. A good cackle...",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Judging from the sound of the audience, everyone enjoyed this as much as I did. The only downside is laughs and shouts were so loud and so frequent I missed a lot of the lines. But that's OK, as I intend to see it again and buy the DVD.KISS KISS BANG BANG is an outrageous send up of potboiler fiction and film noir, and works on every level. The direction is oustanding, the story engaging, and arguably the best performances by Robert Downing Jr and Val Kilmer.The very first scene sets the story up well; it seems like a standard scene type, and then gives the cliché'd scene a bronx cheer. It continues to do so throughout the film, within the noir genre. You'll expect one thing, and it twists it around in some outrageous way.Downey rarely delivers a less than outstanding performance, and his hapless Harry is one of his most memorable. His voiceovers alone are worth the price of admission.Kilmer's portrayal of ""Gay"" Perry is sublime. This is the best performance of a gay character in recent memory. The character is the cynical, competent 'straight' man to Downey's bumbling Harry, who's good intention lead to particularly hellish moments.Michelle Monaghan enthusiastically owns her role as the female lead, with brass of a potboiler heroine, and holds her own against the other two leads.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
196,kingmonkey,the best film of 2005,10,30 September 2006,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was all that i had anticipated and much, much more.the basic premise of the film is a murder mystery, but the threads intertwined with this give the story its substance and sheer brilliance. for those of you who got overexcited about the thematic crossovers of something like Pulp Fiction, here is the concept done properly, with fully fleshed out characters enhancing all the overlapping segments.Shane Black already had a reputation for delivering quality entertainment as a writer, and here we get to experience him delivering the same and then some with full control over the project. his debut directorial work makes you wish that, somewhere along the path of the 80's and 90's, someone had given him the opportunity sooner. KKBB will be hard to top, but let us hope his second film comes sooner rather than later.an outstanding cast entire has as its figureheads two of the more infamous crop of current actors, Robert Downey jnr and Val Kilmer. both overtake their previous best-ever performances and deliver astonishing performances. when you finish with this film, you will fell compelled to get your hands on every other film they have done to either watch or re-watch, so refreshing of the mind are they here.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang works on so many levels that it is hard not to think of a target audience which it isn't suitable for. this was criminally overlooked at the majority of movie awards, don't you as an audience make the same mistake; you will be the only loser if you do.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
197,glocksout,Daring dark comedy,7,14 August 2006,"I had heard about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang prior to its release, and fully intended on seeing it in theaters. However, it was put into limited release, and I missed out on it. It is unfortunate that this is the fate of such a fine film. I'm sure it will be one of those ""DVD hits"" like Donnie Darko, Boondock Saints and Pitch Black.The movie features under-rated actor Robert Downey Jr. as a petty burglar who happens, by chance, to land a gig as an actor. He's sent to Los Angeles for more screen tests and training with a detective - played by another under-rated actor, Val Kilmer - for his part in the film. Downey finds himself in the middle of the Hollywood party scene where he runs into Michelle Monaghan, whom he had grown up with in a small Iowan town. Together, the three of them are thrust into a plot featuring many dead bodies appearing in places they would rather not have them, and many dark comedic moments.The beauty of this film is how well writer/director Shane Black (adapted from a novel by Brett Halliday) mixes the conspiratorial murder mystery with off-kilter humor and fanciful cinematography. I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, suspense, and humor all as independent movies, but brought together into one coherent piece moved it beyond any one part.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
198,The-Kissable-Writer,Shane Black is a wizard of hilarious dialog. Top notch comedy!,7,7 February 2009,"KISS KISS BANG BANG's greatest strength lies in cleverly knowing how to be self-aware without coming off as self-indulgent and arrogant. It's because it doesn't take itself too seriously and LETHAL WEAPON writer Shane Black's plot purposely hardly matters that the film becomes such a hilarious, relaxing time at the movies. Black's especially a wizard of coming up with outrageously funny back and forth's, the dialog in the lesser known THE LAST BOYSCOUT - perhaps the best post-1988 DIE HARD copy - also proofs Black's expertise.When a blonde asks protagonist (and narrator, as he so eloquently points out in the beginning: ""Anyway, by now you may wonder how I wound up here. Or, maybe not. The point is, I don't see another Goddamn narrator, so pipe down."") Harry about his profession to which he dryly replies: ""I'm retired. I invented dice when I was a kid."", after which the blonde - impressed - nods slowly.Robert Downey Jr., who plays our self-deprecating narrator, portrays him in the delightfully laconic way he's famous for. He's in a higher mode of hyperkinesia here than ever. Val Kilmer surprises friend and foe with a (moderately) impressive and hilarious turn as ""Gay"" Perry, Harry's ""partner"" (pun not intended). He plays an actual detective who's to help Harry prepare for an acting job. They may just be the most hilarious on-screen duo since LETHAL WEAPON legends Gibson and Glover. They're not ""good cop, bad cop"", they're ""fag and New Yorker"".KISS KISS BANG BANG is a hilarious film noir spoof, and will have you rolling on the floor laughing.

The dialogue and structure of the film were obviously meticulously considered and crafted. The only valid reason not to see this film is if you don't like the word F-U-C-K. If you don't like that word, don't see it because it's all over the place (used as commonly as it's used in LA today).

But sadly the movie was a (slight)letdown and I have to blame the publicists of the movie for it. Movie is great...but when you start to compare it to Tarantino's pulp fiction. That's pushing the expectations to far.And what follows is an inevitable letdown.Also I wonder if the action sequences in the end was deliberately done in a way so that it would look similar to the Lethal Weapon series. The whole shootout thing on the bridge was done before. Give Downey a wig and you'd think you was watching Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I walked out of this movie thinking not only was this the best movie of the year, but probably one of the best in years! A totally refreshing, original, creative, inventive, dazzling movie! Robert Downey, Jr. has never been better and I'm a new Val Kilmer fan. I also loved the fact that Val's character just ""happens"" to be gay. So many times in Hollywood they make the mistake of trying to make a gay film - having a gay character and trying to build a movie around it. It was very refreshing to see a representation of a gay man in a Hollywood movie who wasn't swishy, lisping and nelly. And how refreshing to see that Robert Downey Jr.'s character had absolutely no issues with being friends and associates with this man. Bravo!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
202,JoeJames76,Two fine actors at the top of their game.,7,17 August 2006,"Have you ever watched a movie and it becomes startlingly obvious that the actors you're watching probably had more fun making this film than you are actually watching it? Well, that's definitely the case with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a film that tries to revive the buddy cops, noir, and postmodern film movement, as well as the careers of director Shane Black and actors Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad film. Far from it. In fact, the way in which Downey and Kilmer throw themselves into their roles with such reckless joy is the reason why this film works. Despite the mish mash of genres, the film ultimately never fails to entertain, much to the obvious talent both actors have for both comedy and drama.Whoever thought to pair these two actors together deserves an Academy Award for casting. They are truly undervalued as thespians (present author excluded--i've always admired and enjoyed both of them in nearly every film they've done, turkeys included) and together they make a dynamic pair. They have cohesive comic timing together, and know where and when to camp it up and when to play it straight.This kind of chemistry is normally lacking in male-female casting, and though the true stars are Downey and Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan holds her own. This is probably the role that landed her opposite Tom Cruise in this summer's Mission Impossible III. She brings a degree of sexiness along with the balance of laughter and tension that this film plays with.i can usually tell i've enjoyed a film when i immediately want to watch it again with the commentary, and this DVD was just as fun to listen to as it was to watch. Kilmer and Downey continually crack jokes like actors who have seen the highest pedestal and watched it fade away, yet could really care less because their film work speaks for itself. These are two stars who have lived the Hollywood dream, both in and out of the limelight, critical darlings and media punching bags and lived to tell the tale. This commonality sparks commaderie and it shows both on and off screen. It's fun to watch these two fine actors enjoying each other's company.Grade: B+",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Shane Black did very well directing his first movie and I really loved the way he used chapters, as in a crime novel, to lead us to certain points of the movie. Robert Downy Jr.'s narration and point of view of the whole thing makes for some witty narration.

I love the movie's imaginative world and would see it again though I already know the twists and turns. The movie starts with a animation during the credit sequence, which was pretty common in the sixties. Also common were detective stories that came in under two hundred pages. You weren't expected to commit your life to it. That is the appeal of this movie and why it so watchable. I like Val Kilmer in talk show interviews, but until Kiss Kiss Bang Bang I couldn't stand his movies save for True Romance, in which he is good but off camera. Robert Downey, Jr. has been the saving grace of any number of movies and is brilliant here. The Singing Detective was the movie to avoid. Michelle Monaghan ( I am not going to look up the spelling) hung with these guys. It was a beautiful thing to see and she is a beautiful girl. I hope her career doesn't fade to black.

I only managed to catch it at my local cinema in a one off showing, but I really wasn't disappointed.Me and my friend went in the film not truly understanding what to expect. Basically it cracks down to Robert Downey Jr. starting the film off as a burglar, after being shot at he accidentally runs into an acting audition. Breaking down with tears in the office, he accidentally gets the acting job and whisked off to Hollywood with hopes of playing a detective in an upcoming film.Cue Gay Perry a.k.a Val Kilmer who is fantastic in this film with his dry wit and humour adding some hilarious scenes to this film. He plays a gay detective assigned to help train up Robert Downey Jr. The pair of them get sucked into a story starting with discovery of a corpse and building into deeper plot involving kidnapping and murder. The plot line is genuinely well crafted, and is explored in the perfect amount of depth. It is quite simply littered with many funny moments. Probably the favourite of mine being the running joke of the gay detective through the film, involving the 'faggot' gun. Shane Black directs this film superbly, keeping it alive with sharp wit.The whole cast clicks together perfectly with Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer shining with good support coming from Michelle Monaghan. The film is accompanied by a very light hearted narration from Robert Downey Jr. which makes the film that even bit more engaging.Overall, a quirky, very amusing film, with a superb cast, and with a run time of 99 minutes, you simply can't afford to miss it.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang...

The smartness, such as it is, consists mainly of a self-aware narrator, and what one could call 'reality-style' violence for lack of a better term. The film is funny, but this is the humour of deliberate rudeness. The dialogue is lively, but primarily because the writers did not attempt to 'tone it down' to suit what they would call a mid-western audience.Apart from that, there isn't much to recommend the film. The acting is all right, as is the cinematography and direction. Nothing stands out really. Best watched in the company of friends, and best forgotten immediately. If you follow the plot carefully you are likely to find strange bits. There isn't much of a story line, and there is the usual 'smart Hollywood film''s attempt at creating mystery by withholding information and obfuscation.If you hope to watch something that will be worth remembering, avoid.

215,thomas998,poor casting and undecided direction for film,4,29 June 2006,"I watched the film with zero knowledge of what it was even about, no trailer nothing. That said, the film doesn't have a clear direction. It tries to be quirky and funny while trying to be an action/thriller/who don it... It doesn't really deliver on any of those to any high degree. It has a few funny moments but only a handful... it has a few action/thriller moments but maybe only a couple.... as for th whodunit, well its pretty clearly a formula whodunit because you figure things out way before the characters on screen. So it fails to know what it is supposed to be.The second more damaging problem is the casting. There isn't a problem with Downey it with the Michelle and Val. With Val you just don't buy him as the gay detective... he does a pretty good fat detective but I doubt a gay detective in Hollywood would ever allow himself to pack on as many pounds a val has in this movie. The second problem is with Michelle, she is just two young for the role. Her character and Downey's are supposed to be the same age (34) and quite frankly it just doesn't work. Lets face it reality is wasn't even 30 when she made the film and he was already past 40... so what were they doing splitting the difference and picking 34 as their age? Sorry but he looks 40 and she looks like her mid twenties. Now considering their supposed past in the film it doesn't fly... moreover they didn't even need to have had a past for the film to have worked, it would have worked better if they had no past together.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
216,enc1no,Contemporary cinema,9,17 May 2006,"Movies like ""Kiss kiss bang band"", which flirts with other movies and the movie industry, is the cream of the crop of contemporary cinema because it represent a freshness in cinema. The freshness actually springs from the formula that has always been used in cinema and is likely to always be used. All movies that seem fresh is sadly enough almost never completely groundbreaking. There is always a reference to movies made before and the formula is the same as always.This however presents a dilemma. If, as have been said, the movies of today follows the same formula as been seen for decades. And if the only movies interesting are movies flirting with old movies. Then the question arises: Is it at all possible to break new ground in contemporary cinema? To answer this question we must first establish what defines a groundbreaking movie. In my opinion a groundbreaking movie can't under any circumstances refer to a movie already been made. If, however, a movie does not make this reference then the movie, considering the old formula is being used, probably will be uninteresting. Hence the movie can't follow a old formula or refer to another movies. But how can this be done? In a sense all movies refer to all other movies, being in themselves movies.

217,almonetts,"Shrewdly written, expertly delivered comic film-noir",10,17 November 2005,"Directed and co-written by Shane Black; based on a novel, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"" written by Brett Halliday; and starring Robert Downey Jnr, Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan.A terrific opening credit sequence easily sets up the audacity and chagrin of the film for an appreciative audience. In essence, these are the reasons why you need to see this movie: the razor sharp wit, shockingly fast-paced and hysterical dialogue, pulp-fiction-esquire vibe, its pure cheesiness and the cynicism of a beat up old paperback detective novel. Got you yet? Alright, maybe an explanation of the seemingly simple plot is warranted. It begins with a ridiculously funny set up resulting in Downey's character being paired up with Kilmer to observe the latter in his job as a private detective. They hook up with a down-on-her luck actress who brings a case for the sleuths. This synopsis constitutes gross misrepresentation on my part as things get remarkably complex. How so? Well, even the lead the character (who also is purposefully pathetic as narrator) takes time out within the movie to remember where he is in telling the story. There are even snippets of dialogue where the characters attempt to fill in the gaps or actually remind themselves of what has happened thus far in the movie. Downey, Kilmer and Monaghan are all caricatures drawn from popular references of literature, movies and art. All however, are larger than life, exhibit great chemistry and for a movie buff, it is heaven to witness the self referential exercises and hear the narrator shred every narrating convention applicable. Downey's performance is remarkable (neurotic, comic, vulnerable and charming). I have never seen Kilmer in such a well-defined, uproarious piece of work. Monaghan is also integral to the trio and shines exuding a brash, fighting and sexy appeal. She brought back fond memories of early Kathleen Turner and Rene Russo. The fact that her look screams Renee Zellweger, is not a bad thing either. Black became famous in the 1980s for writing the hit buddy movies: Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight. As a first time director, he does well keeping the frenetic pace and allowing the audience to catch up only to get lost time and time again. The style is so disarmingly effective, that at times I shook my head in confusion or found my hands against my mouth, agape in shock. I also think that in creating such a brilliant script that Black may have blacklisted himself in Hollywood for mirroring its supposed fame and glamor and exposing its not too pretty side. His one-liners and connected sub-plots are not typical and Kilmer and Downey make magic with their banter and clinical delivery. All the ingredients of a pulp-noir novella can be found, even employing a structure of chapter-type headings within the movie. Parallel story lines unfold and given plot assumptions are turned over, always with achingly funny results. Even the clichés are clever e.g. a tough guy predictably crashes through a glass table, or body after body turns up, to haunt the characters.I strongly recommend the movie, given the talent of Downey and Kilmer. Downey should be honored with a Lead Actor Oscar nomination; while Kilmer deserves a Supporting Actor nod. It thrilled me to see them both in their element, as I was on the verge of disavowing them as marquee/box-office draws. The screenplay should also attract Oscar consideration. One of the year's best films and one of those rare movies where you'll consistently find something new to laugh at, when viewed each of a dozen times.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I went to the cinema last night to watch this after reading goods reviews about it. Now ill never appreciate reviews again. This films humour was justifiably unfunny. It was like a sarcastic black comedy. Actually there were sarcastic jokes which are sometimes funny but this film sarcasm was answered with even more sarcasm which took away from the original snythe funny comments. And what really annoyed me was that every character in the film had this exact same sense of humour. One or 2 characters at the most can get away with this behaviour in a flick, not the entire cast. It was an attempt of a director trying to make something a bit different but happened to intertwine his own humour into everything the film possessed. Brief summary is that the film echoed the same jokes throughout with no other forms of humour which nearly had me leaving the cinema out of sheer annoyance.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

MY usual good movie is either french, or dark, or serious, or film noir, or message-driven, or all of the above or a combination of.when a movie has all of these attributes, or if not all, most; it is amazing to watch, savor & makes ME feel ""as if"" i have reached movie- nirvana. a perfect example would be ""casablanca"".HOWEVER, when a movie comes around with none of the above, but still manages to take one to places one don't often visit, its ""magic"". this movie is ""MAGIC"". i don't remember when i have seen a movie that i have been so taken with. the dialog is fast, witty & sharp. robt downey just may be the finest actor in the profession, so natural, his talent is scary. val kilmer is truly an excellent actor & perfect for this role. michelle monaghan is divine, & should have a very bright future, hopefully she will receive the roles that she truly deserves.i could go on-&-on, for this is just one of those very few movies that does what Hollywood entertainment is supposed to do, but rarely does - ENTERTAIN! THIS ONE DOES!! GO see it before it falls between the cracks & goes to DVD-land. this deserves the big screen.and, i hope this movie receives the acclaim it should, as well as the revenues it deserves. sadly, i assume it will play for a short period, go to DVD, maybe claim a ""cult-like"" following, a very limited audience. & that would be the real tragedy!!!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Despite this I found it to be nearly unwatchable. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for Downey's character's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it's portrayed. The ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film, having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so.Fans of the film say that those who disagree simply ""don't get it"". I don't think this is so. The plot was not complicated or beyond understanding. It was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured. I ""got it"". I just didn't like it. Paddy Breathnach's ""I Went Down"" and Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" are much better realized examples of the kind of film-making that director Shane Black fails to achieve.I share a birthday with Shane Black but a look at his credits (mostly as a screenwriter)makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

It kinds of reminds me of a Tom Robbins book.I thought the movie was great. It kept me laughing, and I even cried a little. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer were great, and they really made their characters come to life.

She had a very appealing small role in ""Boston Public"" last year. When she undressed while Downey could see her in the mirror and the following scene were possibly the sexiest scenes of the last few years.

Brilliantly written with witty and fast dialogue, set to a dark comic tone and carried out with commendable energy and dynamism by a hilarious cast. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer's chemistry is really the anchor for this film, and what a strong one to have.The only time I wasn't beaming right at this movie were the (frequent) moments when I was forced to open my mouth to let the bursts of laughter escape, which were just bubbling under the surface the whole time. But there is more than just good comedy to this - it is an all round great film, including an interesting, immersive plot with genuine emotional engagement, and a main character you're really rooting for despite his brusqueness and ability to act like a doof.I knew from the opening scene that I was going to like this film, it was just a question of whether it could go on and make me love it - which it did, several times over.

If you think I'm going to bash this film, I'm not, I gave it an 7, and yes, albeit, I usually give all the films I rate on here tens, but that's because I only usually rate films I absolutely love. But I did love this movie. I loved all the little in jokes about Los Angeles, about actors and effed up females in California, I loved the dialogue especially, extremely witty and right to the point. But the thing about the film in general is that everything, while to the point, is pointed in every possible direction. The narrative is so boggling tangential that I couldn't find to focus on exactly what transpired. But I'll watch it again, I'm sure, and I'm sure I'll pick up more the next time, all the little details that just kind of flew right past me. And I don't have a problem with that, normally I love re-watching a film if it's clever like this, but usually that's with a film like Domino or Running Scared, where you got the basic plot and the characters and even some little things thrown out at you to pick up on, but this movie, this movie is so layered and slightly pretentious, I won't know where to start, who to pay attention to.

Haven't laughed that much since... actually I can't remember.Anyway, ""welcome to the party"". If you haven't got here yet then stop what you're doing and if you're not watching this within an hour then there's no hope for you. Your narrator will be Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr), who steals stuff (toys, gum, watch, whole lot of other things which aren't free) but don't worry he ""feels badly"" about it. He didn't really pay attention when they were teaching grammar, probably because he was staring at Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), the 'dreamgirl' who screwed every guy in school except him and his best friend Chook Chutney, who, according to 'Gay' Perry (Val Kilmer), was probably also gay. 'Gay' Perry by the way says stuff like ""poo-perfect hell"", keeps a small revolver by his balls, oh and his ring-tone is 'I Will Survive'.Ah it's bringing a smile back to my face already... :-D Back to the point, Harry has gone from N.Y. to L.A. by an interesting turn of fate, and he's being taught detective lessons by 'Gay' Perry for his screen test. Lesson 1 is: what to do when you witness a car driven into a lake with a dead girl locked in the trunk. Lesson 2: how to concentrate on pretending to be a private detective whilst trying to get a spider out of Harmony's bra when she turns up blathering on about her murdered sister. Lesson 3: what to do when the dead girl suddenly turns up in your shower and why you shouldn't accidentally pee on the corpse.Add a cut off finger, definitions of the word 'idiot', 'Ike, Mike and Mustard', hanging on by the arm of the same corpse suspended in mid-air, Protocop eating cookies and drinking beer, some of the strangest Christmas parties I've ever seen and detective novels where ""my case... and your case... are the same f***ing case"".Not your thing?

Rarely do I watch a movie more than once but I've seen this 3 times now and would love to see it again.

There he meets up with Val Kilmer's Gay Perry character, a P.I., who has been hired to show him the ropes as the character Harry is to play is a detective.

230,amacmillen,An instant classic!,10,22 January 2008,"I saw ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" on a regular Saturday night, expecting that it would just be another popcorn-fluff run-of-the-mill half-cooked spy ""thriller"" that would be good for two hours of entertainment on a weekend night with friends but not for anything else.Boy, was I wrong.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang focuses mainly on Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.), a thief who, through a series of impossible but hilarious coincidences - I won't ruin exactly how - becomes an ""actor"". He relates to us his childhood in the small backwater town of Embrey, Indiana. I've never heard of it either. But he gives us some background on his childhood, which includes his childhood friendship with Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), the girl of his dreams who slept with everyone in Harry's high school - except him. Harmony's rough home circumstances and her obsession with the ""Jonny Gossamer"" novel series drives her to leave Embrey when she turns 18, bound for LA with dreams of becoming an actress. One caveat: she has to return someday to free her younger sister from their abusive father's clutches.And so, Harmony, the struggling actress, meets Harry by chance at a birthday party socialite Harlan Dexter is throwing for his daughter, Veronica. A few seemingly irrelevant/innocuous details are given to us about Harlan and Veronica's recently reconciled relationship...The agent that ""discovered"" Harry as an actor during that hilarious coincidence is at the party too, and introduces Harry to 'Gay Perry,' (Val Kilmer) a detective whose homosexuality is no secret. Oh, but he's not gay anymore, he claims. He just can't get rid of the nickname. Perry has been assigned to take Harry on ""detective training"" the next night to train him as to what a true detective does so he can act it better. Truth be told, Harry has no idea what he's doing at this point, he's just winging this entire situation. He was previously just a low-level thief, now he's attending parties with LA's socialite class.Anyway, long story short, during Harry's ""detective training"" something goes terribly awry: a body turns up. And then another. And another. The pair discover three bodies in something like 4 hours. Then, of course, Harmony gets involved in some way, and off we go, a five-day odyssey of police chases, stakeouts, uncovered corpses, Russian roulette, decapitated fingers, and a whole lot of confusion and coincidence that would never happen in real life. Of course, the love story thread in this movie occurs between Harmony and Harry (duh), as Harry tries to kindle a relationship fifteen years after they last knew each other.The action and plot in this story are dark. Very dark. There were points when I felt like this movie couldn't be classified as a thriller-comedy, merely a very intense and dark spy movie. But then the directors would reel us back in with some hilarious line or darkly humorous event that wouldn't offset the menacing atmosphere of the movie but still makes you laugh and become emotionally invested in these characters. Director/screenwriter Shane Black's biggest accomplishment with this movie was expertly balancing the sometimes-horrifying action plot with the very messy romance plot and a good dose of black humor (and sex) in between.The story is great, too. Seemingly small coincidences and events at the beginning hold great sway for what happens at the end, so even if you feel as if the movie is slow to pick up (it is, it takes about 20 minutes), well, keep paying attention because things that happen in the beginning are very, very important to the story.Overall, 10/10. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard and been so intrigued/terrified/grossed out watching the single same movie at once. An instant classic that almost defies genre, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is now a staple in my DVD library. You won't regret watching it.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

This writer and the director are amazingly apt and talented at capturing the humor and wit in the most grim situations.... unlike the crap that is Knocked up, both these characters are show as 2 clear personalities with distinctive drives and motivations (even their wounds and broken aspects are not hidden or concealed)... their interactions among each other (when the 2 main characters re-meet each other) are filled with depth and resonate with something any romantic and cynic can relate to: the nostalgia of your ""first love"" or crush or best girl/guy pal when you were a kid. That special place you always have for the kids that were part of your magic show, your secret ninja club etc... is tapped perfectly to create a sense of dreams had and altered by the reality that is L.A.Robert Downey Jr. rocks the screen.. his performance literally lifts your spirits.. he is alive on so many levels - and Val Kilmer is hysterical, brilliant, sensitive. I had no idea who our lead girl was but she is so awesomely mischievous and self-aware in all the right ways for this role.. brilliant chemistry between everybody ( I hate to harp on ""Knocked Up"" but that movie just embarrassed me in how horribly miscast everybody was for everybody else.. the older of the 2 little girls is the only person that seems to belong in that failed attempt to capture a modern romance).

How can you get involved in a story when the characters are obviously not real people but just living cartoons who behave in a manner completely unlike any living people? Downey is great as always. But Val should complain to his agent as it will be hard to climb back to star status after this silly role. The best that can be said about this film is that it could turn out to be a great game.

236,madmaxmedia,Incredibly Funny and Witty,8,6 February 2006,"Great cast. Kilmer and Downey Jr. deliver their hilarious punchlines with great timing and 'pitch'. There are so many funny moments in this film, mostly dialogue-driven. I'll settle for the cliché 'razor-sharp wit', but Shane Black spends the entire movie making fun of clichés like that. Downey also 'narrates' the movie, and does a great job with that as well.The 2 male leads were excellent, non-cookie-cutter characters, especially 'Gay Perry'. Kilmer's best lines arise from his character's very self-conscious nature, whereas Downey best moments arise out of his character's naiveté about LA and crime in general (ironic considering he's a thief from NY...) I think that's why the humor was so fresh- if they had both been wise-cracking know-it-alls it might have run thin. The female lead was also pretty good, but could've been better. She was a great idea for a character, but not nearly as well developed as the other 2.The plot is so-so, but starts to wear itself out with all the twists. I guess the various twists and turns fit the whole 'Johnny Gossamer' pulp theme, but do little more than that- fulfill a role. It's like it could've ended up being a very smart, funny, AND great movie, but it ended up 'just' being very smart and funny (that's still more than what you normally get though...) The movie also does a great job of skewering/parodying the entertainment capital of the world, starting when Downey in a laconic and anti-climactic manner tells the audience, ""Welcome to LA...welcome to the party."" If the plot line about Downey crashing a casting call sounds unrealistic to you, the way it plays out is actually pretty good (but I can't give away a spoiler!) It's more or less just a clever conceit to throw Downey and Kilmer together anyways.Humor and acting get an absolute 10 out of me, the plot gets a 6 or 7, I'll say that averages out to about an 8.5 out of 10, which I'll round up to a 9.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

The hero is an idiot. The dream girl is a slut. The private eye is gay. And so on.This isn't an original idea. Plenty of good movies play off the clichés of the old noir films. The old movies themselves played off these clichés. Instead of doing something with this premise, they make it indulgently self-referential. It's a movie about people making a re-make of a movie based on a series of potboiler detective books, and the books and the movie and the remake and the actors are all involved in a plot set in motion by the events of making the original movie and the remake and the plot is just like one of the stories from the books. And then they have the main character (who grew up reading the books in town where they filmed the original) narrate the whole thing and compare it to the books and the movie. And he's making a movie based on the events of the movie.And that's it. They are so busy being self-referential that there is no character development, no interesting situations, no witty dialog, nothing.As I said, it's like a bad student film.

At a wealthy client's party he stumbles onto a petty thief played by Robert Downey Jr. who is accidentally hired as an actor after he runs into a screening set in an attempt to escape from the police after he is caught breaking into a toy store stealing Christmas presents. Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. accidentally team up and Downey ends up being Kilmer's side kick in the strange events that follow. Both of them become embroiled in solving the murder of a young girl whose body they stumble upon. Without knowing who really is his client Kilmer has hilarious nervous breakdowns and tantrums while Downey plays the self righteous troubled soul to perfection. What follows is a hilarious, emotional and chaotic chase to catch the bad guys and avoid all the flying bullets right up to the happy ending.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
242,GreyHawkXY,"Don't expect too much, and you'll enjoy a great movie ..",8,12 June 2006,"Following the tradition of his other movies, Shane Black once more took a large bowl, threw a little thriller, some action, large amount of witty dialog and jokes, and some spicy mystery, and than mixed all the contents and poured the result to the theater .. I liked the movie, I admit .. The movie has everything and not too much of something with a perfect mix .. It is a movie for pure enjoyment .. Not an absolute-comedy with low intelligence, not a pure-action where your head will ache from all the CGI effects, nor a pure crime-conspiracy-mystery where you will think and think and think and sometimes have to watch the movie a second time to grasp the story .. A perfect blend .. But .. :) .. My mistake was that I read too much reviews and comments before I had a chance to watch the movie myself .. In every scene I expected something bigger, funnier, more intelligent, etc. .. During the view I always compared it with Shane's previous movies and that diminished my enjoyment a little till the end .. It is a great movie on its own right, but still I think I liked Last Boy Scout or Lethal Weapon series more than KK,BB (I was younger back than, that may be the reason) .. And there is also one think that bugged me .. It is OK to let a 'voice' to tell the story in certain scenes, his thoughts, his motivation (generally the lead hero) .. But in some scenes, Shane took that idea to the extreme and let the actors really talk to the viewer, let impossible events to happen .. He just tried to remind the user that, that's a movie, and these are actors, and nothing is real here .. Why ?? .. Why did he do that ?? .. I know it is a movie, there is no need for him to remind me, why the whole distraction ?? .. It was just not for my taste and ruined the experience further .. A great movie but my rating is 8, -1 as it failed to answer my expectations, and another -1 for unnecessary movie-viewer interactions ..",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

244,whatalad,classic Shane black. awesome,8,12 November 2005,"This film was brilliant, I cant remember the last time a cinema audience was in constant hysterics. Lethal Weapon is my all time favourite film and the Shane Black/ Joel Silver combo is a very welcome return to cinemas screens. If only other action comedies were this good! Val Kilmer and Rober Downey Jr are really good together on screen, much better than i thought they would be. There was not as much action i thought they might be but after you see the film you realise that everything is perfectly balanced and an 'all out' action finale may have spoiled the tone of the film, which is perfect throughout. If only Joel Silver would concentrate on making movies like this rather than ones which 'star' rappers (Cradle 2 The Grave, Exit Wounds), the world of action movies would be saved from the evil clutches of Michael Bay (except The Rock, of course).It just goes to show how talented Shane Black really is: after 10 years out of the business he's back with a bang (bang).",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
245,grimjack-2,"Funny, clever, intelligent, complicated, but most of all... Entertaining!",10,20 December 2005,"Funny, clever, intelligent, complicated, but most of all... Entertaining! This is a truly wonderful film, in that while it encompasses so many elements we've seen before, it rises above all of them because of the combination of witty dialog and a plot that keeps moving along so fast that we don't have time to realize we've seen so much of it before. Except of course when the narrator is telling us about the cliché we are witnessing. Or even when the characters in the film are telling us about a series of pulp novels that the story is somewhat following.This movie didn't get a wide enough release, and I don't want to wait for it to become a cult classic in order for me to find more people to talk to about it with me. If you saw it and loved it as much as me, tell five friends!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
246,Shingle,"Slick Slick, Cool Cool",8,11 October 2005,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is like a wildly expensive hooker who looks like she's worth millions yet is actually worth a hell of a lot less, but when the ride is so damn good you just can't complain and you'll be telling all your friends. Put another way, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang has a certain something which the murder mystery genre tends to lack - a sense of fun. So much so, that I was crying with laughter!After an incredibly stylish opening credits sequence, we discover that Harry Lockheart (Downey Jr.) is our narrator and also a criminal. After breaking into a toy store to get his nephew a Christmas present, the alarm brings the attention of the police. Harry escapes only to stumble into a film audition. He miraculously gets the part and is immediately whisked off to LA to receive detective lessons for his role from private detective 'Gay' Perry Van Shrike (Kilmer). While at a party, Harry meets struggling actress and childhood friend Harmony Faith Lane (Monaghan) and stupidly explains that he is a private detective. However, it's not long before Harmony soon asks for his help when her sister is found dead.All the trademarks of a cheap pulp murder mystery novel are here - deaths (obviously), sex, trashy clubs, a beautiful blonde who ought to be advertising shampoo, wrapped up corpses, crazy clues and more twists than a pole dancer on cocaine. Can you believe it; the film even predictably has a bad guy fall through a glass table. Ooh, how exciting! What makes this stand out is the genius that is writer Shane Black, responsible for Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang makes for Black's directorial debut and he must have a PhD in wit (a word a lot of critics will be using when describing this).Robert Downey Jr. looks rough and downright cool as Harry Lockheart, the quintessential loser hero whom the young male audience will aspire to be. Harry is a good-hearted criminal (they do exist) who stumbles amidst the superficial gloss of Hollywood movie making and the murders taking place in LA. You can't help but root for him as he constantly tries to stay alive and make sense of the crazy scenario he's landed himself. This is a role that's likely to push Downey's career into overdrive, making him the next best thing... again... for the third time. Just like classic film noir, Harry also narrates the story, but what makes this all the more comical is that unlike the overused hard-boiled detective, who gives the audience a dark and moody voice-over, Harry can't even narrate properly! That Val Kilmer makes for one tough homosexual, a welcome change of stereotype. Delivering a memorable performance as 'Gay' Perry, Kilmer is at his best when doing just about anything with Downey. Every one of their conversations raises a smile if not a laugh. With the right material, as seen here, he can handle humorous roles and this would certainly rank as one of his funniest. Michelle Monaghan is seductively charming as Harmony Faith Lane (which is what every parent ought to name their daughter). Coincidentally playing an up and coming actress, she'll definitely be catapulted into more work after this, since that's usually what happens to up and coming actresses who undress in a mainstream film. She manages to hold her own amongst the male leads mainly due to her character's nature to go out of her way for just about anything, thinking little about the consequences.Not only does the film show us Black's love for the trashy detective novels and the murder mysteries of film noir, but his love and hate relationship with movies is also apparent. Taking the usual workings of what goes into the makings of a film, Black adds a new spin and manipulates these formulaic conventions such as narration, flashbacks, extras and credits. Can you say ""post-modern"" boys and girls? Movie buffs are likely to get a kick out of these 'self-aware' moments.The film works as a showcase for Black to present his razor sharp wit during a number of absurdly thrilling and comic set pieces, each one clinging onto what is essentially a routine murder story as dense as the American government during a natural disaster. Unfortunately the fast pace leaves you with little time to piece all the clues together as the film skims over plot details. So much so that the lead characters have to do some obligatory explanations just to hook in anyone who is completely lost.The brilliantly written characters and scenarios is what keeps one watching, but if a little more hot loving was given to the frequent twists and findings that occur then this could have pushed itself further as an eccentric little masterpiece. Still, where else will you come across the sight of Robert Downey Jr. hanging above a freeway by grabbing onto a corpse's hand sticking out of a coffin, which is somehow miraculously suspended in mid-air... only in a Shane Black film ladies and gentlemen! Neat touches such as Perry's mobile phone ringtone, Downey making a sly remark about his past narcotics habit and a 'too-clever-for-its-own-damn-good' closing scene (which does look like it's been tacked on at the last minute) simply adds further icing on the already overly sweet cake.The film treats you with its diverse absurdity and Shane Black's creativity of snowballing situations pumped with his remarkable talent for outlandish one-liners. Its fusing of a killer script and cool characters makes Kiss Kiss Bang Bang this year's Hot Ticket and one of those rare examples as to why I go to the cinema.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

248,Sir_Ipkiss,Just Awesome,10,28 May 2007,"From the trailer kiss, kiss, bang, bang looked interesting. nothing more than that. just interesting. when i had the pleasure of watching it, i still wasn't expecting much. robert downey jnr and val kilmer didn't instill one of those...great actors must watch movie. but omg.the movie is brilliant. beautiful. great. awesome. the opposite of bad. it starts off at a fast pace and just keeps going. let's break this down into components. the storyline was intricate but really easy to follow. it was a murder slash mystery at its best with a very film noir feel with downey's narration. if you watch it simply for the whodunnit of the story, it will not disappoint. the end was unexpected and in that did all it was supposed to do.the script was amazing. it had a feel to it that just yelled comedy. lines that you will use over and over and over again. funny to the point of bringing you to tears. sarcastic, ironic, in your face punchlines - it really had it all. the acting. now this where i cannot say enough. val kilmer outdid himself as gay perry. he took the role of gay detective with a punchline at every post and just ran with it. looked serious and carried that overtone which just added an even darker side to his lines. Downney junior was even better. he played the role where you could feel he was trying to be cool and even carried it off. you'd watch him light a cigarette or pick up a chick or be the knight in shining armour and he'd pull it - but then two seconds later you'd realise he was such a big dumbass. he pulled it off brilliantly. BRILLIANTLY. and his narrating was awesome as well. the overall feel of the movie was cool. it was dark and sinister which just contrasted with the humour. its the type of movie we don't see very often and if we do, many people just won't get. the style, the humour, the atmosphere - gelled together with great acting and a brilliant plot and storyline. one of the best movies of the year but will no doubt be swept under the mat and underrated for years to come. but will be one of my all time faves.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

And the mystery was great, it had me guessing the entire film. Plus it was actually pretty funny, particularly the finger incident (incidences). And seeing Downey on the drugs still trying to drive and get back to the hospital, priceless. Plus, Michelle Monaghan was great. And hot. And I'm gay so that is saying a lot.

All the actors are really funny and convincing in their performances, even as terrible things are happening. The mystery is definitely there, but you aren't really expected to understand everything that happened even when the movie ends. Still, if you do understand, you'll notice that it's a genuine noir mystery underneath it all, with no unexplained leaps of logic. There's an action element there, too, but in more of a Michael Madsen sort of way where it's not the centerpiece of the film, just a tool for building up a climax.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

With all the action and mystery involved in the movie, this surely has to hold the audiences on the seats. The cinematography was average, but the performances and the script more than makes up for it. The background score the comic timing is exceptional. Performances overall were good Val Kilmer is impressive as a serious detective out to solve mystery, Michelle has always been an eye candy, though a couple of scenes she has pulled of really well, like the one where she meets Harry after the murder, and the one where she stays with Harry in hotel, others she just had been average. The showstopper no wonder is RDJ, as the confused, idiotic thief who ends up in the wrong place. Wonder how this guy just pulls off any act so spontaneously and flamboyantly. Be it the Iron Man billionaire whose the smartest guy around or Harry in this the stupidest guy around. RDJ's screen presence is just awesome.

There is violence but it is so stylised as to be inoffensive, even funny. The dialogue is extremely witty and pitched to the viewer with a brain (though the less intellectually endowed will still enjoy the film). But the great revelation for me was the performance of Robert Downey Jnr. I can't recall having seen him in a film since his great turn as Chaplin, and I was aware that he has had drug problems. His Harry, the dumb, incompetent petty thief, is a creation of great depth and pathos and ultimately one of the most endearing characters you will ever see on screen.

Gay Perry is about the funniest character around, and one line from Robert Downey Jr. has become a frequent quote amongst me and my friends- ""Fuzzy little bitch."" Come on, that's just hilarious. However, the movie did hit a pretty significant ditch right in the middle. The story slows and the dialogue loses some of its wit. I found myself bored, which is not a good thing.

I'll buy the DVD so I can see it again to listen to all the parts I could not catch over the howling laughter of an ALL AGE GROUP audience. My brother who lives in L.A. could not find a theater to see it. Very strange since the movie is essentially about L.A., the movie biz, and well just about everything else thrown in. I can't even find a DVD release anywhere. Does ANYONE know why the studio did not distribute this movie? Why despite adamant great reviews Hollywood pulled the movie?

You wait with high expectations for the latest movie from a particular director, or featuring a favourite actor, only to walk away thinking about how much better it could have been.But every now and again you're reminded of why you shell out the bucks to sit in a dark cinema. Seeing Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was one of those occasions.It helped that I had no expectations. I mean, Robert Downey Jr is always good value to watch, but Val Kilmer hasn't done it for me since Top Secret. So this could have gone either way. Add in a first time director, and it was truly an unknown quantity.But all this is forgotten as the movie starts. All egos are pushed aside as the actors just get on with the job of entertaining us.At its heart, it's basically a good old fashioned detective story, with nods to such greats as Chinatown, but treating the audience with respect, knowing that we've all seen these movies before. The script is top notch, with Robert Downey Jr's narration giving us just enough information (with a nod and a wink) to keep us excited.The backdrop to the main story is Hollywood, so we are also treated to some observations on the mechanisms of the film world.

Has he gotten over ""The Pickup Artist"" yet? The hyper-kinetic script is wearying, and after the midpoint of the film I stopped caring who killed who and why.

I was pleasantly surprised: their chemistry is fantastic. I found myself looking forward to their next on-screen appearance together. The rapid-fire banter between the two of them, while irritating in some movies, is what makes this movie. Apart from letting the viewers in on what's going on and helping them solve the mystery along with the detectives, the banter allows you a greater view into the character's personality. This is important since we don't know anything about them, there isn't a backstory upon which to base their actions. The narration by RD Jr. is also a plus as events happen pretty quickly and you need it to keep up. Lastly, all the gay jokes at Kilmer's expense are in no way derogatory, they just add to the fun.

It's a movie that is unabashedly about the kiss kiss bang bang of movies and nothing else, but it manages to give you a rip roarin' time without being dumb, which I feel is somewhat rare these days. Downey Jr. is charming and the accident-prone greenhorn thief pretending to the an actor pretending to be a detective and Kilmer is always sarcastic and smart-ass (and the narration abuses itself and everything else). This duo keeps you laughing/amused, the dialogue is sharp, and the pace so fast that you don't even have time to stop and figure out the plot. While the ending tricks you with some unbelievable things (which it makes fun of itself for), I think the true ending of the film is a lot more pessimistic than you end up feeling (which, for me, was a bouncing high!) because if you really think about it, it's a movie about people who have not attained their childhood dreams and for one second, they actually think that they might have gotten to that magical something, that greater destiny, that we're all looking for.

I was just so very bored. Barely to absolutely not funny at all, lots of boobs and - as always - no penisses (if you go with nudity - fine with me - but then it's just annoyingly double standard to see only intimate female body parts). Also, the story is just confused and the entire look was: yellow. While the scenery was stuffed with everything all over the place all the time. Of course, the humor was painfully predictable, and I didn't care for any of the characters at all. Not to mention, the plug in the beginning was just so far-fetched, and the end was - well, what can you expect from a story that would be best described as: much ado about nothing. So, the end was accordingly.The reason I gave it 3 points instead of just 1 is Robert Downey Jr. He did a really good job. He did everything to humanize his character. Unfortunately - it was wasted on this boring story and this boring character. I'd love to say some nice things about the female lead as well. However, she was just that: a female that had to do femaly stuff. Like: wearing more or less clothes. And playing with the lead actors feelings (while looking all saucy).

I first watched it a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. Today I was recommending it to someone and realised I didn't really remember the plot as well as I normally do. Watching it again tonight it dawned on me that the reason for that is that the plot is simply the pin-board to which the pieces that make this movie are hung - and there's so much going on that you forgive the plot-holes and simply enjoy the way in which it is told.Robert Downey Jr narrates. If I'd known that I'd have never rented it in the first place. So don't let the fact that this is a narrated film put you off. The narration is wickedly hilarious, self-deprecating and breaks the 4th wall in a surprisingly entertaining way.It's a hard movie to describe, but in some ways it's simply an enormously entertaining romp that simultaneously nods to, and takes a pot-shot at the detective genre.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
269,froglegcutlet,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Got me Laughing!,9,3 November 2005,"A movie that sets the bar for noir films, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang starring Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer gives theatres everywhere something to look forward to in November. With toxic pulp humor, the movie, directed by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) doesn't only send laughter through the air, but truly reveals what low-budgets films can accomplish, a film with raw honest hilarity. The movie sets aside stereotypes and puts a fresh look on both sexuality and life. Ironically the movie focuses on something more important than the profanity and rated R scenes, the movie sends a message about fate and making choices. KKBB starts the movie with an introduction to the character named Harry Lockhart (Downey Jr.), a petty thief who narrates the story about how an incident changed his entire life. Lockhart first frantically stumbles into an audition room for an acting role in a detective movie after being chased by cops. He then partners up with Gay Perry (Kilmer), a detective who offers to train him for the screening for the movie auditions, by having Lockhart follow him around. Although Perry is tough, strong and witty, Perry is also gay, which sets a paradox between the two characters, Perry and Lockhart. The movie heightens thereafter, when the two characters witnessing the covering up of murder; and dead bodies start showing up in the strangest places. The movie is 100 percent pulp and humor.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
270,brrrian40,A Must See!,10,20 October 2005,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is an entertaining movie that knows it is a movie (hilarious narration and cuts back to different scenes). Downey Jr was historical and he narrated like nobody's business; however Val Kilmar's part as Gay Perry was the funniest- he is witty and surprisingly good at being gay! Also, I was surprised to see how funny this film actually was, I found myself laughing out loud during multiple parts of the movie. There were funny cuts to scenes that reminded me of the Simpson's/ family guy type of humor. But, there was also some dark comedy where I almost felt guilty to laugh (but still did). It's one of those movies that you have to see twice in order to catch all the jokes.Oh yeah, Michelle Monaghan is gorgeous! Go see this movie!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
271,kdmanning-1,Black Humour,9,26 March 2006,"Shane Black has to be one of the wittiest movie writers around. There are so many sharp lines in this movie: ""Gay Perry? Still gay?"" ""Nah, I'm knee deep in p***y, I just like to keep the name"".This film is a pretty accurate take on film noir while taking the mickey out of it as well.I've always loved Robert Downey Jr, and this has to be one of his best performances - knowing, sarcastic, hints of angst - just superb. a great 'anti-hero'.Val Kilmer is surprisingly good as well. He doesn't overplay Gay Perry and bounces off Downey really well.Does the whole 'this is a movie and I'll play with reality' thing work? Well, pretty much. Parading dead characters and historical figures at the end was actually really funny, but I can see how it might annoy some viewers.Could you honestly see Johnny Knoxville in the lead? (He was rumoured to be the initial choice for Downey's role) Jeez, I couldn't, it would be dreadful.So, funny, sexy, great performances, great story. 9/10.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
272,magnoliafanboy,Brilliance of Shane Black is boundless,10,20 June 2007,"Yes, Shane Black's brilliance is boundless. That is an odd comment to make considering he seems to deal his stories in a genre that has so many trappings and cliché. What he does with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is acknowledge that fact that he is working in a detective/sub-action genre. He has done this before, and hopefully again.The narration of Downey's Lockard is beautiful. Its raunchy, sad, and honest. It doesn't reiterate anything on screen- but wait it does. And that is the joke. Black jabs and ribs at the constraints of film noir. Yet, he takes it to the limits by finding a way delve you into a story in manner that only film noir can.You have the faulty character, who in turn is a faulty narrator. There is the careening twists of this tale that make it a good watch but also comment on the double backs and overlaps of those classic films of yesteryear. Its supposed to be confusing.Black gets that feel of Los Angeles right. It was done pretty well in Lethal Weapon, but here it is perfect. Like LA Confidential or Memento, there is a pulse of a place where normal people are involved in bad things among the good places.The comedy is biting and bold. The narrative takes you places you'd not expect. With all that said, it is a film that is to be watched. You will meet someone who has talked about it, but like this review it would give the film justice. It is said to say that it has become an unnoticed gem. It has become some new cult midnight movie. But if you are ever up late and its on, or you don't know what to check out at the video store take a spin on this.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
273,martinfresh,What About Those Kisses?,8,8 February 2006,"I guess the whole idea of a movie is to shock audience, or even better to let them know this isn't another cliché Hollywood waste of time kind of movie. One way or the other they got the idea and presented it perfectly. Scenes are definitely hilarious and at some point I was actually thrown of my bed. Actors deserve credits for realistic performances, Val Kilmer especially. I still don't know whether he was a 'fake throughout the movie or a 'real deal, which was kind of an idea, since the whole movie turns out to be rather disturbing having no true connections between the begging and the end. Of course there is something that bothered me quite a lot. It's no secret they were under the influence, well the similarity is obvious, of pulp fiction. The thing that bothered me is that they stroke in the middle between standard and non-standard picture. At first sarcasm was convincing, but as the events got clearer, so did the fact that there is no turning to other direction. What I meant to say was that it actually becomes predictable and that lowers its value in terms of quality. However it's still a damn good movie and quite a refreshment from all standard American shots. I have to give one prop more. In the end Val slides his way on a wheelchair to meet Robert Downey, and they actually warn us that forcefully happy endings like this suck and that they are well aware of it and they are more than right. 99 cases out of 100 where fleeing, shooting, fighting and any other abuse for that matter happens, end is either sad or disastrous. Than how come in movies in such circumstances only one in hundred ends in peril. I believe I can answer that. Its because most movies suck.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Michelle was yummy lovely, I'll have to watch more of her work.But halfway through, something started to really bother me... like, I started to realize that although the zinging one-liners were keeping me interested, the plot was becoming really dull... and very stupid. And I got the feeling I'd seen it before and was trying to place it. Bingo! ""Un-!#$%ing-believable!"" It ran almost exactly along the goofy storyline of Andrew Dice Clay's 1990 movie ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"". Even several scenes were setup the same--the way it was narrated, struggles in a park, hanging off a bridge/building. Anyone remember Zuzu Petals?

278,Floh-Ruehle,very quick and dark comedy,10,4 August 2010,"This is by far my favorite entertainment movie. It is a great comedy with brilliant actors and witty dialogue. And it is made for people who like modern movies.That last sentence was important. I have tried to convince many friends of this masterpiece and quite a few of them were disappointed when seeing it. So if you want to watch it, be warned: The movie is cut at a very high pace, it is stuffed with very fast and funny dialogue and it has many complex story turns. That means: You have to be wide awake and concentrated when watching it and you have to be okay with movies that feature fast and many cuts (like the newest ""James Bond"" movies or the ""Bourne"" trilogy). If you are a non-native speaker like me and you are watching the movie in English, you might even need a re-watch to completely get it. It should also be mentioned that there is some (although not excessive) violence and nudity in it.If you're okay with all of that, please go and get this movie! I can recommend it for the following reasons:The story is well thought through and the script is nothing short of genius. The main character narrates the story and sometimes falls out of character, speaking directly to the viewer in Brecht-like manner. Still, the viewer has to think on his/her feet quickly to follow. The setup and storyline can be best described as film noir with lots of comedic aspects. The acting in the movie is great and very believable. Especially Robert Downey Jr. (not a surprise) and Val Kilmer (a little surprise) deliver amazing performances in all of their shared scenes. The cinematography is very old school, but beautiful. Shane Black (this being his first movie) does not experiment with strange new styles, but makes sure that every single shot during the movie, you can hit pause and enjoy the atmospheric light setup. Finally, the entertainment value: I can not emphasize enough that even after having seen the movie at least 10 times, I can still laugh for two hours straight. The main strength of the movie is that it plays with the expectations of regular movie-goers and then completely goes the opposite way.So, if you are okay with the above mentioned conditions, you can get but a huge buying recommendation from me. Sit back and enjoy!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

If you think that you have a pretty good deadpan or sarcastic since of humor then this movie would be fore you. I laughed so hard in the first 45 minutes that I wasn't sure what genre of film this even was. It seemed like kind of a hip mystery comedy but I couldn't even begin to limit it to one category.

I try not to spoil too much, but I must say that this film is not so much propelled by it's story, which just serves as a skeletal structure to give the characters room to interact, but by it's very sharp dialog, it's nicely drawn, but not overexposed characters and on the spot acting by it's leads. Downey Jr. back at his best and a definite high for Kilmer. The audience was raving, laughing and cheering, especially for Harry Lockheart (Downey Jr.), the somewhat good-hearted but unlucky and not-so-streetsmart-thief-become-actor-become-detective. One of his most memorable and laugh-out-loud scenes involves... uh... urinating (!) and (even if this must seem really strange for someone who hasn't seen it...) is destined to become a comedy classic. It's Shane Black's first turn as both writer and director. He wrote ""Last Boy Scout"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" and the ""Lethal Weapon""-films and watching ""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang"" one starts to wonder how those would have turned out if he had directed them from his own script.

Some of the best scenes in the movie came from these two working together.I was not expecting a spy/thriller/mystery to be nearly as funny. I doubt that anything along these lines will come out for years with the same comedic punch. Right from the opening scene, you felt like you were actually looking at the situation through RDJr.'s point of view.

283,amoore-39400,A trademark style with top notch results,8,18 July 2016,"With his directorial debut, Shane Black presents a style full of self-awareness, subverting some clichés of the noir genre while playing others straight, all of this carried by a fantastic performance by Robert Downey Jr as main character Harry Lockhart.It's hard to label Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a buddy cop movie, not with so much more focus on one perceived ""buddy"" over the other, and neither of them are cops either. Harry Lockhart is our main character and narrator, a criminal turned good at first winning you over with charm, but keeping your attention and care with great development. This movie is often referred to as Robert Downey Jr's big comeback, and the performance he gives lives up to that notion. Val Kilmer as Perry and Michelle Monoghan as Harmony also give good performances, but the range Downey gives from smarmy and casual to emotional and serious is stunning, one of the best parts of the movie.However, that particular range can be said for the movie as a whole; it always feels like these are actual people talking and interacting with one another, not people on a screen. This is thanks to Black's outstanding screenplay, with dialogue rivaling Tarantino's level of novelty and realism. There are some writing traits that can grate with repetition (one guy has a sarcastic response to a somewhat legitimate question, followed by ""of course it is.""), but the writing never loses it's charm from it.The story is a basic mystery deal, but with plenty of subversion and the tongue-in-cheek style to keep things interesting. Lockhart literally tells the story to the audience, pointing out certain clichés and devices with full self-awareness. Plenty of other clichés fall apart on their own to hilarious effect, but some are strangely played straight with no mention or reconstruction. They don't hurt the movie greatly, but they're noticeable enough to feel out of place.Overall, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is bolstered by a slick script and a standout performance, full of excitement that doesn't feel said and done. Shane Black made his name with this movie, and it's one worth remembering.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I found this painful to watch, I really didn't like this film at all; mainly due to its plodding pace, obscure plot and horrible characters.The opening credits animation is brilliant, but then it didn't get any more exciting than that. The narrative from Downey Jr was cheesy, irritating, and was intrusive to the flow of the film. I didn't find it funny.The biggest problem was that I didn't like any of the characters in the film, the murder mystery wasn't at any times tense... and it just stumbled along for an hour or so. I thought it was then going to finish, what had come was unsatisfying - but I wanted it to finish... but it didn't.It then went on for 1/2 hour or so more. And I will admit it got a bit more interesting (no more narrative, hooray... until the end). Oh and the scene where Downey Jr found himself auditioning for an acting role was really good.I love murder mysteries and detective stories... but I just found this too obscure. And as I say I really didn't care what happened to any of the lead characters.I don't remember any of the visuals being particularly great (apart from the opening animation which I liked). I don't remember enjoying any of the music, I didn't find anything particularly artistic about this movie.I was really looking forward to this movie after what I'd heard about it, and after watching the trailers.

287,donalexei,Decent comedy/film-noir/thriller,7,24 January 2009,"Well I have to say I was hoping for something a little better. I had heard about the snappy, fun and well-written dialogue and was hoping to get some. What I got were mixed feelings about the film.In 2005, it's difficult to bring about a mix of comedy and action/film-noir, with plots that twist and turn to make your spin and keep it original, what with the high quality of films such as Snatch or Pulp Fiction. Here, the scriptwriters have thought of transposing all the clichés of the film-noir genre (bodies, twisted stories, mean gunmen) to an actual Hollywood setting and poking fun at them all the way.Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry Lockhart, a nice guy who made the wrong decisions, fell in love with the wrong girl, and suddenly got the wrong job. He is our narrator, and the director seams to have had fun playing around with that idea. A couple of times the film stops because the narrator forgot to tell us something or needs to change the decor a bit (I liked the part where he moves those two blokes out of the way). This sort of works, but there again the problem is we've already had our share of mythical film narrators (Alex de Large and Fight Club's ""The Narrator"" spring to mind) and here there seems to be a bit too much importance given to the ""cool"" narrative ideas which punctuate the movie, giving it a sort of cocky feel. A film that thinks it's better and more original than it actually is. Also, Downey's acting got sort of annoying sometimes, with his unsteady, jerky way of talking which felt a little overdone. The acting in general looks as if the actors themselves were having a good time, but were they thinking a lot about their audience? At some points, it looked as if the film was taking itself a little too seriously. I know this is a spoof and it's not meant to be, but still it's the impression I got.All in all Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a film which has its good moments, but isn't very satisfying when you're looking for something a bit more original, better written, and less cocky and self-assured. Persoally I would watch Lock Stock anytime again than watching this one again.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
288,cheap_as_chipios,"self conscious, witty, Hilarious",8,26 February 2006,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang revolves around petty Criminal Harry Lockhart who stumbles into an audition for a role as a detective and is crowned Hollywood's brightest star subsequently being trained for his role by real detective (Val Kilmer's inspired Gay Perry). Shane Black made his name penning Lethal Weapon and the Long Kiss Good Night, films stuffed to the hilt with clichéd smooth as hell language and over the top gunfights characterised by Bad guys who couldn't hit a barn door and good guys who never missed but disappeared off the Hollywood map. In fact rumour has it Black had to change his pen name simply to get the script for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang read, a legacy which surges through the whole film with Blacks (and every other action films) signature twists and turns dealt with a great depth of skill and providing ample plot but a sometimes subtle sometimes painfully (yet hilariously) obvious parody of Hollywood action films making Kiss Kiss Bang Bang the potential classic it is.Through out his return to the Hollywood fold Black goes about deconstructing every film he's ever written and prodding it. The buddy cops of Lethal weapon weapon become the uneasy partnership of pro detective Gay Perry (Kilmer) and wannabe actor Harry (Downey Jr), the slick dialogue becomes humorous reference to Hollywood in general and hilarious twists on typical 'slick' dialogue (""You're an idiot. You know that. You know if you looked in the dictionary next to the word idiot you know what you'll find? A picture of me? No! The definition of the word idiot. Which you are"".) With the whole film narrated by Harry himself often making mistakes and skipping bits. For all it's comedy though Kiss Kiss Bang Bang retains it's slick, cool feel and brings all the thrills of Blacks earlier offerings.It does give less bang for your buck but most audiences should see this as a worthy sacrifice for the humour introduced.Whilst watching Kiss Kiss Bang Bang one could easily draw parallels with Pulp Fiction for it's super cool dialogue and genre referencing but it's closest comparison may possibly be Wes Cravens Scream. Craven pulled apart slashers films, explained them to us then went about contradicting every convention referencing every horror film he could think of on the way but still made a fully fledged slasher film instead of the parody you would expect, Black didn't explain action to us but what need is there, pull the trigger say something witty, but he did turn every convention of the standard action film on it's head, point fun at a never ending range of films and come out the other side with a fully fledged action film better than any action film he'd ever come up with before.In Conclusion: Deserves to be a classic, see it now",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

However, I like plots and movies to stand on their own. The movie was funny and entertaining on it's own but I felt it was ruined with a lot of unnecessary short sex pieces and gore. It just wasn't needed. Was it was being done to purposefully get the R rating? You would have thought that the language was plenty to carry that off. Robert Downey is his usual Robert Downey self so not a big stretch there. I haven't seen a lot of his films lately because that seems to be a trend. No in-depth characters for him.

293,Murdoch584,THIS is What Comedy Should Be,10,29 June 2007,"There are many types of humor that make me laugh. Airplane!-type humor makes me laugh just as much as It Happened One Night. With that said, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.Where to start? First of all, the script (the cornerstone of any good movie) is fantastic. Shane Black shows he knows how to create humorous dialogue which does not get old as the film progresses. The one-liners and sarcastic observations are non-stop and a total joy. Yes, there is a lot of swearing in this movie, but it's hardly noticeable as it fits the characters and is not used as the punchline for every joke. Some reviews I've read have said something to the effect that this movie is a weaker version of a Tarantino vehicle. I couldn't disagree more. Tarantino WISHES he could write dialogue as witty as Black does. I've seen all of Tarantino's movies multiple times and seek in vain to find an inkling of ""witty dialogue"" unless of course one considers idiotic conversations about tips to be ""wit."" I digress. Secondly, the casting is perfect. Robert Downey, Jr. shows that no one else could have possibly played the role of Harry Lockhart: ambitious, naive, a tad bit stupid, but still likable. Many actors probably would have overplayed the character's stupidity and lost the audience's rapport. Kilmer was equally spectacular. Unlike Willem Dafoe's decidedly creepy portrayal of a gay detective in the overrated Boondock Saints, Kilmer makes Gay Perry seem like a real person. Also, his comic timing is perfect (""Is that a clue?""). How he and Downey, Jr. did not get nominated for Academy Awards is a travesty (when will the Academy learn that doing comedy is much harder than drama?).The only possible downside to the movie (and it's a minor one at that) is that one has to watch it a few times to figure out the plot entirely. This is no problem as each time I've watched it I've picked up even more jokes. In the end, it's no less confusing than Pulp Fiction except that it's a million times better (since when did editing a movie out of chronological order make Tarantino a ""master filmmaker?"").Many comedies can only be watched once before they start to get dull. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang on the other hand stands up to multiple viewings and gets funnier each time. This is tongue-firmly-in-cheek humor for people who are familiar with film noir and for people who can appreciate how difficult it is to write satires with witty dialogue (try it sometime).A solid 10/10.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

The story was extremely well written on the crime drama part. I never would've thought Val Kilmer & Robert Downey Jr. would've made a good couple, but they're brilliant together.The film centers around Harold (Downey) being a petty thief, and his incredible run of misfortune, reunion with his high school flame, and a series of seemingly unconnected events, all that lead him to a new life on the straight and narrow with a less than straight detective (Kilmer.) Without giving it away, and I'd rather not give away more than I have, this film is such great time spent, it easily is added to my all time fav's.The only way you could not enjoy this film is... well... you have to enjoy it.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

The one-liners and the constant direction changes from scene to scene was refreshing and although this concept has been done many times, with it's 'good-uns' and 'bad-uns', this was stylish and well executed.I should say that I am a big fan of 'Film Noir' though, and there has been some lazy... Nay, embarrassing attempts at it in the past, but this was a much different angle on the theme whilst still maintaining the genre.I guess there are some out there that won't gel with the style, but by the end of the first scene I'd gone from slightly 'dis-interested' to 'didn't expect that QUITE like that'...

It's great to see one of the masters of buddy-action-film-scripts at the helm this time. Although I find the performances a little result driven, it's a solid effort at directing and hopefully by the next go he'll have learned a bit more about directing actors - even actors of Downey Jnr and Kilmer quality, need help from their directors. The film is cool and fun and I'd certainly watch it again. I only wish that it could have been made a few years ago, as the self referential rubbish that we've seen a lot of recently, diminishes the experience I have watching KKBB, which clearly works. Still it's good to know that now, in the time where everyone likes to know who wrote the movie, people might actually go back and watch things like Lethal Weapon and not dismiss it as ""just an action movie"" or The Last Action Hero as ""stupid"" etc etc.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

There is a plot which is not the best plot ever written but it is by no means weak either. It centres around a man (Jr) with no direction in life who gets thrown into a mad mix of crime, corpses, love and coincidence which results in some of the best laughs I've had all year.

It seemed to start well, and then degenerated into a mad roller-coaster culminating in an action scene eerily reminiscent of Lethal Weapon/Die Hard.I think the movie tried a bit too hard to be funny, too hard to be witty and trying too hard made it a bit tedious. The genius in the movie is the acting. Pros like Downey and Kilmer will almost always win. Even if they didn't get me clapping, they did get me to sit through that spectacle. I do remember using the f-word at the end of the movie, but then I may have been over-reacting.Nevertheless, since everyone thinks it's such a great movie, I'll watch it again... slowly, if the movie's maddening pace will allow me.All the bad things being said, it does have some amazing moments, and you WILL laugh.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for something beyond the usual Hollywood crap, although the violence and language may turn off some people. Highly quotable, hilarious, violent and very entertaining. Rent it today and impress chicks (or gay guys) with some of the one-liners. Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. are great and I especially enjoyed the comments they made to the camera. Some viewers may think it's too cute, intelligent or hip for its own good, but I found it amusing and interesting. I especially enjoyed a scene near the end of the film where some of the dead characters paid a visit to the main characters. Pay attention to who shows up!

Downey's narration is exceptionally amusing and Val Kilmer gives the most convincing and humorous performance of his career. The pace is lightening quick and there are some really good noirish twists in the plot. Downey's hapless hero is played to perfection and the whole film is a very good cinematic experience.

Downey jr and Kilmer have great chemistry onscreen, with each actor complementing each others performances. Downey jr's Lockhart and kilmer's gay perry are made all the more memorable by Shane black's fast-paced, quip-filled dialogue. Michelle Monaghan plays the extremely adorable and hilarious Harmony, who was a very pleasant surprise for me in this film. The plot of the movie is really enthralling, with constant twist and turns. My one criticism of the movie is its villain, who is quite weak. However the performances of Downey jr, Kilmer and Monaghan more than make up for this.

Popularized by shows like Curb your Enthusiasm, and Arrested Development (as of recent). The film is quirky, non sequitir, self-referential and blisteringly complex. The buddy cop formula is tweaked beyond recognition with creative flair and sleek packaging from start to finish, but at what point does it all get to be simply too much? How much self-referential, intricately plotted schtick should be viewer really have to be subjected to in one sitting? KKBB walks a fine line when it comes to beating the viewer over the head with its own sense of smug self-satisfaction, but the piece is redeemed ultimately by the undeniable chemistry between the shared lead performances turned in by Kilmer and Downey Jr. The plot seems to drawn influences from a plethora of sources; with motifs and plot twists reminiscent of everything from Chinatown, to Lethal Weapon, to James Ellroy, to Seinfeld (!). The plot blossoms and thickens with an engaging sense of momentum and energy that is perpetuated by the culminative whole of fresh-noir interpretations of the sleek exterior of L.A. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a film that will no doubt find a happy, gradual home on DVD and may well be looked back on in 20 years as a harbinger of a post-modern revival in American and World Cinema.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

312,Coraxcz,Very interesting movie,10,29 September 2006,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is one of most interesting and original movies I've ever seen. Of course, it's from Shane Black, so it simply must be good. First thing you'll notice are dialogues. Especially every conversation between main characters - Harry Lockheart (Robert Downey Jr.) and Perry van Shrike a.k.a. ""Gay Perry"" (Val Kilmer) is simply hilarious and truly memorable (there's some quality chemistry between them). I've seen KKBB several times and it still makes me laugh. But it's not only good thing about this movie. Shane Black is playing with noir genre, using clichés originally (e.g. that old trick with two people kissing to avoid attention of bad guys or police - It is here but in KKBB it's Val Kilmer kissing Robert Downey Jr.!). It's bit difficult to tell which genre exactly KKBB is. It's just refreshing blend of genres. Something like Dark Comedy/Thriller/Action maybe.Harry Lockheart (Robert Downey Jr.) is ""small time crook"", who while chased by police accidentally runs into film audition. He gets the part and in LA takes detective lessons from Perry van Shrike (Val Kilmer) who is not your stereotypical pink-shirt-silly-accent gay but rather tough guy and private detective. On party he meets his childhood love Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan) and then all the trouble begins... I don't want to make any spoilers so discover rest for yourselves. I can only assure you that it's VERY interesting movie where characters finds themselves in crazy and dangerous situations. Yeah, while talking about crazy I can't skip Harry's narrating. It's not usual dark voice-over we all know... Not at all. Harry is very bad narrator but funny too. He is forgetting, returning in story... Performances are also very good (Robert Downey Jr. is really amazing). Pace of film is very fast - which is good thing - but unfortunately it's easy to get lost in complicated storyline so it's good idea to watch KKBB at least two times to understand everything. But this is my only complain to this otherwise great movie.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

It was great to see Robert Downey, Jr. back in form, exhibiting the charm and cleverness that won him an Oscar nomination for ""Chaplin."" This flick was a fresh change from so many of the recent boilerplate movies foisted upon us recently.

I think it's very lame to talk to the audience also...the fantasy factor is ruined a bit by that. It's like an actor is drunk or high and is saying his lines, then suddenly he goes off the point and is rambling at the audience. Just plain dumb.I don't have anything else to add.

It has suspense, a love story, humor, touching scenes, and a true detective story. It will leave you feeling a little bit of everything at the end. The acting is superb; I wouldn't have cast it any differently. You fall in love with all of the characters, and root for them to win in the end. The settings and camera views make it dark, but still friendly. The plot is great. Also, the movie is narrated by Robert Downey, Jr. himself, and he narrates it like he's talking to some good friends. He will rewind clips and speak completely comfortably.Only downside? It's a little twisty-turney. There are many different aspects to this movie and it moves quickly. There are definite plot twists and things that happen that will catch you off guard (some may like that.. some may not. I happen to love it!) I hope this helped...it's a different movie, but great nonetheless. A good date movie, Iwould say. And a great movie to see with just friends.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

The cast and crew were top notch, van kilmer was great, Robert Downey Jr. was amazing with his loser criminal role, I think its just the type he seems to fit in like a glove. The reporter Paul Avery role he played in zodiac, the irresponsible prodigy role in iron man are just his thing.Coming to the movie i really didn't find the "" way too naive "" commentary too appealing even for a noir comedy, guy Ritchie kinda thing would have worked a charm. May be he was trying something of a pulp fiction esquire but could never pull it off.The story line was good and linear with lots of unpredictable sequences, not really catchy music. Dialogues were hilarious and to a point fresh with out the regular clichés.I think the movie is way to highly rated but its a good watch when you got lots of time to fool around and feel good about it, the last scene where all the dead guys show up in the hospital was down right stupid even just for the sake of innovation..unnecessary.Any way hats off to the director to go off key, experiment and break the trends of regular movie making.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Kilmer and Downey Jr. attain an on screen chemistry that is rarely found in any other film of the genre. An intelligent plot, wonderfully told and entrancingly portrayed, unfolds through several styles of storytelling. From the word go I was laughing, deeply and often, yet just as enticing was a sad and thorough tale of hope, despair and redemption. The dialog between the two male leads carries the story forward while making the viewer laugh again and again, and the sexual tension between Downey and Mognahan is as poignant as it is hysterical - kudos to the phenomenally talented Downey for allowing Mognahan to carry several of their scenes together. Shane Black's use of the unexpected, and at times ridiculous, plot devices to carry the narrative forward. He hasn't been this spot-on since Lethal Weapon, and Gibson/Glover, as well as they managed to do, never came as close to capturing the perfection of his intent as the Kilmer/Downey combination manages to convey.

Robert Downey Jnr is extraordinary and pretty much an acting God, and finally, Val Kilmar is allowed to stretch and be the actor that we all know he can be without all the studio pressure.

What am I saying? Who cares? Back to the review...).Well, it was dark, but it was also spectacularly funny and very well directed. I'm not a big Robert Downey Jr. guy, but he was spot on in this. He needed to be really funny and deadly serious (and even a little desperate)-sometimes all in the same scene-and he pulled it all off. Val Kilmer was great in what could have been an really overbearing, gay cliché of a role. Instead, he played it straight (gawd-please believe me when I say there's no pun intended) and let the material work for him. He was perfect.And finally, Michelle Monaghan... good lord. She made the movie. MADE THE MOVIE! I'd seen her in Mission Impossible 3, and she was okay, but man, I did not know she had a performance like this in her. She was whip-smart, witty and drop-dead sexy. If there's a sequel to this movie (and maybe there shouldn't be, because this one was so good, but there could good be some good stories left in this universe...), she'd better be in it.Well, that was a somewhat rambling commentary on what I just saw, but I'm half asleep anyway.

It begins with some wry subversion of the crime movie formula, but falls into those very conventions for most of the second and third acts. It then over compensates at the end as if to convince us that it's really smart... But is it? The filmmakers strive for satire. At best, however, they achieve parody. Val Kilmer's performance is unusually phoned-in, probably the result of a one-dimensionally written character (a gay private eye whose ring tone is ""I Will Survive""... ha ha). Some of the gags do work. I will concede, in fact, that Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is consistently amusing (bumping it up over the ""5"" mark). Also, there are some jaw dropping surprises that a less ambitious film wouldn't dare to include.Ultimately, we're looking at an A for effort, C plus for execution.

331,evileddy33,Pleasantly surprised,8,26 December 2006,"I was cornered into watching this movie by my girlfriend and due to lack of options at my local cinema i gave in. I was not expecting much from the movie from the outset,dismissing it as another boring 'chick flick'.......Boy was i wrong.This film had me hooked from start too finish. Robert Downey jnr. was superb throughout adding wit, charm & raw emotion to his role.Val kilmar (who i usually dislike) was equally good,shrugging off his hard man image and showing his funny side.Although the plot of the film was a bit sketchy to me, the direction and acting kept me on the edge of my seat. A laugh a minute, quite simply a breathe of fresh air compared to some of the dire comedies out there.A MUST SEE",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
332,rjprice-1,Narration,7,11 June 2006,"I enjoyed the movie and laughed quite a bit in the beginning where the narration and stop action were frequent.The narration seemed to end suddenly like they didn't like the idea, then threw it back in at the end....It seemed like a story that could have been great, it they'd had an extra hour to fill in the gaps.That or Downey should have kept up the commentary, at least a bit less frequently than he started off.I loved the chainsaw scene. I closed my eyes not really knowing where the movie was going. There could have been some great lines behind the scenes at the lake and during the chase.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
333,funky_pete_63,A Hilarious Comedy Thriller,10,31 July 2008,"I rented this movie thinking it would be a straight forward enjoyable thriller. What I got instead was a superb modern noir thriller with hilarious dialogue and characters thrown in for the ride.All 3 of the leads (Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan) are on fine form as they investigate the case of the dead people in L.A.. Downey Jr. in particular is outstandingly funny as the part time thief turned actor who finds himself thrown into a life of crime and murder. However, it is Shane Black's script which steals the show with enough quotable one liners to last for years. The dialogue is wonderfully weird at times but never feels like it's there just to get laughs. The plot moves along at a great pace as the situation gets further and further out of control. The Russian Roulette sequence is one of many cases where a situation gets out of hand very fast and, despite the fact I know what's going to happen, will always have me on the floor laughing.The plot is confusing in places and I certainly needed a second viewing to fully understand it all. This isn't a problem as, for me, the real success of this movie is the fact that I still found new things to laugh at in repeat viewings. Yes it's far-fetched. Yes it's unrealistic. Just keep rule number one in your head (This business. Real life. Boring.) and you won't be disappointed.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

I am Rarely Satisfied by a movie, usually just entertained for a bit but this movie is one of those movies you can watch many times over and not get bored. It had many moments that leave you laughing hard enough to miss an important piece of the plot so be careful! Your going to want to watch it more than once to really understand the plot itself though. I was so captivated by the characters and their interactions that i missed a whole lot of the movie's actual plot. Its really a shame that movies like this get overlooked by the General population.

The movie had a great cast and Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer are hilarious together. What a riot! I never imagined Kilmer playing a role like this. If you are ready to watch a movie with all the thrills, great plots, and non-stop laughter, this is the one for you. If you like to be reeled in hook, line and sinker, again and again, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is your movie. I sat on the edge of my seat the whole time, every time I watched it.

I didn't get to see it until pay-per-view but I can say, confidently, that this was the most enjoyable movie I've seen in a long time. Robert Downey Jr's charm was mixed with a surprising chemistry with Val Kilmer. You can tell both actors had a blast together and on the film.It's going to be one of those must-buy additions to any collection. And I know I can't wait to buy my own copy. If you have the chance to rent it (or pay per view it ), it is definitely worth the buck.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

The film, based in L.A. circles the parties of the famous and the lifestyle of actors and actresses struggling to find work. It deals with the fiction to reality murder plots that we read in books and never see in real life. The film itself is full of ""raised eyebrow"" moments and scenes that leave you trying to figure things out for yourself. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer make one hell of an entertaining duo.

I'm planning on renting the DVD again just to catch some of the jokes I know I missed. Truly entertaining. The writing of this script is brilliant -- but have to admit the delivery by the actors makes it work. Very puzzled as to why this film was not in the theaters (or if it was, it was not in them for very long) so more could enjoy it. Never say this about many movies, but I would definitely look forward to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - Part Two if it were to come to surface. But it would HAVE to be with Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer playing their same roles.

If you enjoy an intelligent well written script, watch this movie. If don't like Robert Downer Jr, you should STILL watch this movie.I can watch this first thing in the morning, awake and thinking, and it still taxes my brain. When you're dead beat and have no energy left, this movie will not drain you further.Take out the comedy and you have a sublimely saddening plot.

Some of the dialogue in the beginning seemed fresh. But then soon got very tedious because of the . lack of story. What they think is a story is just a lame set up for a bunch of action sequences that are unbelievable (in a bad way). Dialogue and the overall screenplay tries way too hard. I'm not watching a movie, I'm watching someone typing on a computer trying to write. That's the worst. Voice Over tries to be cool and hip and fresh and ends up completely taking you out of the any story that it does have. The lighting is horrible. Everyone in it has bags under their eyes.

Obviousely, given this amount of information on the movie I wasn't expecting anything special, or humorous.Surprisingly enough, the movie was more on the lines of a murder mystery with the most unlikely characters solving it. All the Actors did a great job giving their characters personality, humor, and wit. Although, making the story less believable, but more enjoyable I thought. The script was very well written which seems difficult given the caliber of movies that are coming out these days. Make sure you get a chance to catch this movie.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

It was lent to me through an upcoming producer that works for me. I had mentioned Robert Downey Jr.'s role in Ironman and how it my have been his best role yet and then he suggested I watch this film. In the beginning, I really wasn't expecting much, however, after viewing the film, I actually created an IMDb account just to leave a comment on how good this movie really was. As far as Jr.'s role, I would say its just as good as Ironman's, only in a different, more relatable approach. Before renting, know that this is for the intellect capable of following a fairly fast-paced and detailed plot but holds your attention the whole way through. Offers several twist and in my opinion, should be what leaves Hollywood for the big screens.... not this teeny-bopper, Meet the Spartans garb! No regrets whatsoever!

343,black_rocket_95,Highly underrated...,10,17 April 2011,"'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' is a film that I can watch over and over again and always discover a joke that I've missed before; a film that I will always laugh at and never get tired of!Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.), is a hapless slacker who robs shops and homes to get by. After a failed robbery, he ends up winning a role in a Hollywood cop flick and is sent off to Los Angeles, where he gets tutored for the role by real-life private eye Perry van Shrike (Val Kilmer), AKA 'Gay Perry'. Of course, they don't get along, although things seem to be going reasonably well; until Harry drunkenly blurts out to his childhood sweetheart (Michelle Monaghan) that he's a real detective, and a messy murder mystery ensues.The script is sharp and snappy, with some truly fantastic one-liners, delivered pitch-perfectly by Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer, who share a fantastic on-screen chemistry together. The (somewhat small) supporting cast is equally good, with Michelle Monaghan delivering a great performance as Harry's love interest. The film delivers a perfect blend of comedy, drama and action, ending in a dramatic car chase and shootout in downtown L.A. which is great fun to watch.I don't think 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' would be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like black comedy, buddy movies, and you're a fan of Robert Downey Jr. or Val Kilmer, I would highly recommend it. 10/10.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

KKBB was the opening movie in Cologne and it got a feverish applause after wards.I can only say that this movie is one of the biggest surprises in the Action/Thriller/Comedy-Genre in the last years. If you liked Black's scripts for Last Boy Scout, Long Kiss Goodnight, Lethal Weapon etc. for their tongue in cheek humor, wicked dialogues and sick ideas, you're gonna love this movie.The cast delivers and gets the movie going. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Black still has some very cool one-liners and dialogue. Downey Jr is really amazing in this role as your typical looser-criminal kind of guy.The film struggles a bit at the end, but it was so much fun to watch nonetheless. The Teaser Trailer came out today, so you might want to watch that. Luckily doesn't already show you the best parts.I really hope that this movie attracts a big audience, because Black has definitely written and directed a highly entertaining movie, showing you Hollywood behind the scenes.

I was held captive to it consistently and found that the ride was never-ending, Shane I believe has done it again, movies are about entertainment and I was most definitely thoroughly entertained, the entire audience was kept laughing throughout, and you want to catch every witty comment and referencemost of all the dynamics between the characters of Perry and Harold is intelligent and comical without feeling like you are being sold something false. Outrageous situations that without a bat of an eyelash were pulled off without seeming forced, most of all, Harold/Downey was a joy to watch.

The few, admittedly good, jokes were out of place in the context of the story therefore lacking any additional punch - exactly what Lethal Weapon and his other movies managed so well.Not a bad movie, but not nearly as good as it thinks it is.I suspect its one of those films that a certain type of person pretends to like more than they really do (you know who you are :) ).

349,jukeboxbabe680,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang-Hollywood a it's finest,10,13 July 2006,"I saw a preview of this movie on The Show-Biz Show with David Spade a few months back and always planned to see it. BUt it seemed to disappear from my local cinema's. Thankfully I found the DVD just recently came out. I went to my local blockbuster and rented a copy. 10 minutes into the film I stopped it, brought it back to Blockbuster, and purchased the DVD, because I could tell immediately I would like to own the film for more than 2 days. The movie starts out with recently sober Robert Downey Jr. narrating the story of how he got to a swanky Hollywood party. He was a crook running from the cops when he stumbled into an open casting movie audition. The talent agents were so impressed by his ""acting"" that they sent him right out to Los Angeles to prepare for his role as a P.I., where he meets Gay Perry, played by Val Kilmer. Perry is a real L.A. Dick sent t teach RDJ the workings of a cop. They meet a girl, Harmony, and the trio get involved in a murder case. This film is the perfect dark comedy film spoof. Perfect. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing, plays his role so well you wouldn't believe. He is supported brilliantly by Val Kilmer. The banter between the two of them is extraordinary. That is acting at it's finest. Hilarious scenes, including a Russian roulette gone bad and an incidental peeing on a dead body make Kiss Kiss Bang Bang the best movie of 2005. And 2006. And hell, why not 2007 for that matter. One last note: Stick around for the end credits. The song Broken, sung by Robert Downey Jr. is beautifully is played while they are rolling. He has an amazing voice to compliment his amazing tongue-in-cheek acting. 5 out of 5 stars. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Mocking LA is always pleasing in our house. Okay - not so much mocking, but having movie industry people recognizing the fact that LA is a caricature of itself is fun.We enjoyed the narration and if that isn't for you, this movie may not be either. There were some definite Lethal Weapon moments, as this film was not short on action, but (as in Lethal Weapon) they were complimentary to the plot and style, rather than gratuitous shooting scenes.We found nothing we wanted during a whimsical trip to BlockBuster and were so pleased with the gem we found. If you like to smoke and drink socially (or even if you don't) have some smokes and cokes handy.

This seemed to be the case for the first couple of minutes of narrative monologue before the jokes started coming fast and furious. This turned out to be a highly entertaining comedy/buddy film couched in a tongue in cheek film noir setting. The dialogue was witty and the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmour was great. Some of the jokes went by so fast that I'll have to see this movie again to see what I missed as I was still laughing at the previous one. The director spoke before the movie and commented on how the producers were nervous about the risky choice of actors. This was a reference to Robert Downey Jr.'s past addiction problems, but this film proved that he was worth the risk.

He is mistaken for an actor auditioning for a new film role. The producers are impressed by what they think is him acting and hire him for the lead role as a detective and send him to L.A..On his first night in L.A. he is invited to a pool party where he coincidentally reunites with his former childhood friend, high school crush and struggling wannabe actress Harmony Faith lane. To impress her, Harry makes her believe that he is a real detective. They start to meet up and develop feelings for each.Meanwhile, to prepare himself for the role, he is introduced to private detective Perry van Shrike who is mainly known as Gay Perry. When they are actually caught in a real crime things start to change and the problems start to begin. Additionally, there is a mystery about Harmony's sister who has disappeared without a trace. Still not sure, which role Harmony plays in all of this, they start to take up investigations to find out what has happened and if there is any connection between the two cases.This movie has turned into one of my favorite ones.

His impromptu gritty reading where he reflects on the real life death of his friend green lights him to be sent to Hollywood as a potential new ""discovery"".While in Hollywood Downey, gets himself involved in a complicated murder that is intertwined with role he is being considered for. The plot involves an unabashed gay private eye named Gay Perry (payed by Val Kilmer) and his high school unrequited love interest Harmony Lane played by Michelle Monaghan.

Robert Downey, Jr narrates and stars in this brilliant story about a ne'er-do-well's adventures in Tinseltown. Downey and Val Kilmer play off each other perfectly as reluctant partners. And Downey's slapstick moments rival those of a former role's (Charlie Chaplin). Michelle Monaghan rounds out the core characters as the stereotypical disillusioned actress wannabe originally from a small Midwestern town.

Robert Downey Jr is fantastic and Val Kilmer has redeemed himself! The movie starts at a glamorous party. Harry (Downey) introduces himself to us as the hero and narrator - then explains how he got there in a day by day breakdown. A petty thief who sets off a toy shop alarm whilst doing after-hours Christmas shopping, he escapes the police by running into an audition for a detective movie. The producer applauds his 'method acting' and brings him to Hollywood.Also at the party is....Gay Perry aka Perry van Shrike (Kilmer) who is a private detective hired to coach Harry for his screen test. The heroine is the beautiful but trailer trash Harmony Faith, an actress who fails to live up to either name! Harry and Harmony have a mutual love for the detective stories of Jonny Gossamer, with cheesy titles that include ""You'll Never Die in This Town Again."" Perry takes Harry on a night time surveillance operation and it all goes haywire from then on! Moving at a fast pace in a manic way it begins to resemble one of those Gossamer novel as 2 bizarrely random plot lines intersect. Bodies stack up quicker than plot twists, but no one will follow what's going on anyway!!

He has to train with a detective, called Gay Perry and yeah... that's all I want to tell about the plot, because everything else would spoil you too much! But why is this movie so good? It's simple: Cause it's smart! The dialogs in the film are brilliant, the plot is very clever and confusing, the camera-settings are great and last but not least: the movie plays excellent with the fact that it's a movie! The narrator (Robert Downey Jr.) sometimes interrupts the movie and tell you what he's for a bad narrator, or that that Scene is so a big Hollywood stereotype and that's is so great!

Its not gripping, you don't care what happens to the characters, its not funny, and because it so dull you find yourself giving up on following the story and then wondering what the hell is going on. Its a shame because I really wanted to enjoy this film, the reviews were good and I had reasonably high hopes. However I felt really let down by the obviousness of it all. Sure I really enjoyed watching Michelle Monaghan, she is gorgeous, but her character is awful. She plays a slut, and I guess its somehow suppose to be funny that she has slept with everyone under the sun, but really, again its cheap and obvious. I love Robert Downey Jnr, he is great, I love him in NBK and Iron Man, and his acting in this is pretty good I guess, but you just don't care about his character, he is annoying and unfunny and again everything seems obvious and trying to be wacky and funny, but its not.

Good scripts, good films. But still, this guy always worked with sincerity, and this is obvious when watching one of his films.

It's not too fast, but its never slow. I liked the way it plays out like you are reading a twisted murder mystery novel.I think what I liked the most was that Val Kilmer was in it, and was awesome nonetheless.

The movie dragged with it's character introductions, it was complicated and hard to follow.The dialogue was stupid and had no sense of humor what so ever. It was just too complicated for what it was, a simple story. I recommend this movie if you are really bored, and want to fall asleep. BUT, if you want real entertainment and real movie, I do not recommend you watching this.5/10.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
364,MadameWordsmith,Great movie with tons of funny scenes. I was rolling in my seat with laughter!,10,9 November 2005,"I saw a special screening of the movie yesterday and I thought it was going to be so boring, but I was entirely wrong! It was very funny and well written. It was a refreshing take on screenplays and acting and its great to see Robert Downey Jr. back again. Val Kilmer's role as Gay Perry was also spectacular. Michelle Monaghan looks like she can be Liv Tyler's little sister but with more substance (sorry Liv Tyler fans) I loved the sarcasm and humorous one-liners used throughout the movie. The constant reference to real life actors and movies gave it an almost ""real life"" feel. I recommend this movie for a good laugh and great narration by Downey, Jr.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
365,crizzo1232,Moronic!,1,19 August 2007,"Take the most clichéd aspects from the dozens of 'Pulp Fiction' clones that came out during the mid 90's and slather them upon a 90 minute episode of HBO's Entourage and of course, add constant voice-over for the audience member on the go - and there you have ""Kiss, Kiss, Bang Bang"" one of the most contrived, wannabe, intentionally 'hip' and 'edgy' thrillers I have ever seen. Everything is this movie appears to be made for the target audience (18-25 year old men) to relate too and or project themselves into relating to it. The fast smart talking protagonist, who only values cars, money and sex yet adds a level of half baked nihilism to justify his completely shallow cravings. The GQ model gay hit-man who we never see engage in one slightly gay act, or the 20 something model slut-chick who spends half the movie running around in her bra and panties. Everyone in this movie is a supermodel, NO ONE plays a convincing person, not one, every actor plays a stereotype from another movie. Nothing ever slightly goes beyond surface in this movie, it is all about looks, one liners, catch phrases and NON STOP pop or club music. here are more cuts, flash backs, flash forwards, and moving shots that 80% of the music videos on MTV. If you have seen ANY crime thriller from 1995-2000 you have already seen this. There is not one genuine thought, theme, or idea in this movie. It is 100% style over substance.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
366,sjp2124,Laughter,10,21 November 2005,"I did not expect Kiss Kiss Bang Bang to be hilarious, witty, and to have the ability to shape my abs. I laughed so hard for the entire movie, that it was actually a bummer. I missed some dialogue because the entire theater was roaring. I am so impressed with Val K. and Robert D. I had no idea Val was hilarious and the overall delivery of the movie was fantastic. Genuine laughs, a movie I am still quoting, and a show that is a great time with friends. We left the movie theater absolutely surprised at the quality script and stellar jokes. Great movie. I recommend it for a slightly mature audience. There are some sexual jokes I would be uncomfortable sharing with a younger teenager, but this movie is a definite must-see. There is also some nudity, but nothing more that female breasts if I remember correctly. I plan to buy the DVD the day it comes out.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
367,DarkwingDan,A little-known gem that is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen (may contain spoilers),9,15 March 2010,"The buddy-cop movie is a sub-genre that has faltered since its heyday back in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Writer/Director Shane Black's little movie about a crook-turned-actor partnering with an L.A. private eye is one of the most original and entertaining movies I have ever seen.Black, who helped perfect the buddy-cop movie in 1987 writing a little movie called ""Lethal Weapon,"" casts Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer as the unlikely partners in a whodunit double-cross extravaganza that will keep you laughing from start to finish, all the while narrated by Downey's incompetent Harry Lockhart. His character forgets to show a flashback that he tells the audience about, stops the film, and then cuts to the flash back. If you don't like his narrating style, he tells you that he doesn't see any other narrator around so ""too bad."" With its smart script, witty dialogue, and unconventional storytelling, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang makes a familiar genre seem completely fresh. If you want to be entertained, see this movie.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
368,sixdavila,credit where credit is due,9,29 November 2005,"so many people talk about the look alike cameos, but they are not even credited!!!! what's up with that?! loved the movie!! would like know who those actors are especially the Brazilian BB THORTON.... he's hot would love to see if he is actually an actor and what else he's done. whatever!! the movie was great and made me laugh out loud so many times.I love Robert Downey and I love Val Kilmer. such a witty movie and we don't often get that. I t's so cool that so many Gay characters are making it to the big screen and that people are appreciating then and supporting them and they are not all about being gay, they are actually people who talk about other things and have real/fun / interesting lives. Thank you to Shane Black and Joel Silver",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
369,newsgurl11,Amazingly funny film,9,22 March 2010,"As someone who is hard pressed to find a movie that genuinely makes me laugh, I was very pleasantly surprised by this off-beat gem. Kilmer and Downey Jr. are pure comedic gold. The lighting-fast banter is so jammed with fall-off-your-couch-laughing wit that it holds up very well to repeated viewing. Michelle Monaghan is a strong addition to the cast, whose character is a much needed change from the pointless eye-candy type of female characters that so often litter films of this genre. The story itself is intriguing, thought-provoking, and packs just the right mix of serious and silly.It's a shame this film isn't more well-known, as it is one of the best I've seen, period.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
370,lynda032001,Downey excels,10,21 December 2005,"Being Shane Black's first directing attempt, he nailed it.. Perfect job, Shane. Robert Downey Jr. was superb as Harry. You are laughing one minute and tearing up the next. His quick delivery of the one liners is Downey's forte.Val Kilmer and Downey have a real chemistry on the screen. You can tell they are friends and have much respect for the other's craft. Michelle as Harmony was fantastic, also.. I had never seen her in a movie, but will certainly look for her projects in the future. I hope Shane will think about a sequel for these actors. Kilmer and Downey are just too good together to not pair them again on screen.. Go see this movie, you will have a great time. You might even want to see it over and over, and that's a rarity these days...",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
371,DevMasta,Shane Black is the king of one-liners,10,16 January 2006,"Saw it when it finally released on a wide scale, and loved every second of it. Shane Black is the king of one-liners, and he goes all out with this entry in his film career. Robert Downey Jr.'s narration is outrageous and totally entertaining, and his on screen relations with Val Kilmer rocks. The film is so off the wall it can only be viewed in one way: total entertainment. This is the kind of movie you watch with your friends while you're all getting drunk. I would have to say that KKBB is my favorite movie to come out this year, (thats saying something with others such as King Kong and Walk the Line) and is also on my top ten favorites! A completely off the wall, gut-busting good time!",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
372,the_immigrant,should be in the top 250 -spoilers-,8,13 March 2006,"this was such a cool movie it was funny in a charming way. it belongs in the top 250 some where around number 230 or something. the jokes in this movie were fresh and original not cheesy or anything. my favorite parts of the movie where when harry was robbing the toy store when harry peed on the corpse and when he was bluffing with the gun then killed the man ha-ha ha-ha man that was hilarious kiss bang bang was definitely worth watching and i recommended to everyone who is looking for something funny with a good story behind it. ""you think i am bluffing"" - gunshot - ""s**t"" - harry ""i peed on a dead body"" - harry",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
373,artnova,Why wasn't this movie nominated for everything,10,4 February 2006,"This movie had most other movies won out even at the opening credits (some of the best graphics and most creative I've seen). I've lived in NY for 10 years and in LA for 10 years and they have them pegged. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent (as I expected he would be - see ""Chaplin"") and Val is back! I will need to buy this film and see it several times as the pace was non-stop and sometimes I was laughing so hard I missed some of what was being said - even so, the look of the film and the inventive style blows most other movies out of the water. . .my opinion only, of course! This had a bit of the ""Pulp Fiction"" story to it yet I think it was handled better than that movie. I guess I'm supposed to say way more about this movie in order for my comments to be allowed. Seems strange to me as I only need a couple of sentences to explain what I liked about it.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
374,Devis613,I Was Surprised,8,11 October 2018,"The movie has a very good tone , it was very funny and interesting, it's a very good comedy.
The perfomance of the actors was preety good, but I didn't like the Cinematography so much, sometimes is ""enjoyable"" but sometime it wasn't that captivating for me.
The plot it wasn't too fast or heavy but fun and interesting and thanks to it you can know more about the characters and i think that Shane Black was going for making the audience investend on the characters and he did a good job at it.
They could do better with the soundtrack tho, the movie it could have been even better with a theme music/song (in my opinion).
Watch this movies with your friends because it's very funny and reletable",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
375,firefly24,Brilliant.,10,7 May 2007,"Funny, dramatic, violent and Robert Downey Jr on top form, what more could one want? I was not sure whether I would enjoy this film or not but after watching it I can honestly say it was amazing. This film is so quotable, with so many good one-liners, the violence is fast and brutal, hell they even chuck in a torture scene for good measure. A college friend of mine suggested I check this film out and I am now urging all of you to do the same. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have seen it, watch it again. I cannot stress how much I loved this film. Val Kilmer is reason alone to watch it, his performance is outstanding. I cannot actually think of a single flaw in this film, the plot is very tipsy turvy, but that is nothing that can't be figured out, and you should not let anything you hear about this film put you off seeing it.",Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
