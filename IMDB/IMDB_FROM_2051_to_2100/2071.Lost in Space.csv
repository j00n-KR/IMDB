0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not deserving of complete oblivion, but good quality is mostly lost in translation",4,26 September 2017,"Although very fond of the original TV series from the 60s, especially the first season, it is by no means a perfect show and is pretty uneven. It was great and more when at its best (the whole of the first season) but it was near-embarrassing at its worst (the second half of Season 3).Still it had memorable characters (Dr Smith a genre landmark character), a good cast (Jonathan Harris is unforgettable), an endearing campy charm, a dark seriousness in the first season without forgetting to be fun and inventive stories and monsters that made the most of an at the time unique concept. There are worse TV-to-film translations around than 1998's 'Lost in Space', such as 'My Favourite Martian', 'Dragonball: Evolution', 'The Last Airbender', 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'The Avengers' (1998).'Lost in Space' however is still one of those films that has its moments and a few good qualities, but one where it has great talent on board yet manages to make one question its existence. Before those defending the film arrogantly accuse people of being too stuck in the past and refusing change, actually there is far more to the problem than it being a disappointing adaptation of the show, in fact that's the least of its problems and while not a terrible film on its own terms it's a long way from good (personal opinion of course).That it has a darker tone than the show, although some critics may disagree, is not the problem necessarily, and actually people would have appreciated the bigger, opened up approach (with technology having advanced a lot since the 60s it was necessary). The first season had a serious, dark tone too (even if fans remembered the campy charm of Season 2 and the over-the-top silliness of Season 3 a little more, judging by the word campy is often thrown around describing the show). The difference was that it didn't take itself too seriously and still managed to be entertaining and inventive. The film version, to me and fans/critics (this is what is meant by this criticism, so contrary to it being a seemingly misleading criticism it's a valid one to me), strips away the fun, loses the charm, takes itself too seriously mostly and has very little imaginative or original about it. It just felt charmless and dreary.Not without its bright spots. It is stylishly and atmospherically photographed and the Jupiter II setting is very cool and the most imaginative the film gets. Some of the special effects are good if never spectacular. The music score has creepiness and gives 'Lost in Space' some energy. 'Lost in Space' gets off to a promising start and gives one the impression ""hey this may not be so bad after all"", and there are a few nice adrenaline jolts in the action.Casting has its high spots. The best of the lot is Gary Oldman, who actually looks like he's having fun and gives a different, darker and more menacing Dr Smith and it actually works (even though wildly different). Matt Le Blanc may have moments where he's a little smug, which is due to him having some of the worst of the dialogue, but he does have a likable charm too and has a few amusing moments. Jack Johnson is neither too cloying or grating and the characterisation of the Robot is spot on.However, the rest of the cast don't work. William Hurt couldn't have been a blander choice for Professor Robinson, he sleepwalks through his role which cried out actually for the involvement of Bill Mumy. On the other side of the spectrum, Lacey Chabert irritates to a mind-numbing degree and, although the film does try to develop her with particularly those video diaries, she is little more than a stereotypical teen at the end of the day. Mimi Rogers has nothing to do and Heather Graham also grates and has non-existent chemistry with Le Blanc.While 'Lost in Space' is not a bad-looking film on the whole, there are a lot of cheap-looking costumes and some noticeably poor special effects. Particularly for that interminable Space Monkey (Blarp? who is actually for me far more annoying than Jar Jar Binks) and for Smith's spider form (some of the worst spider effects on any visual media, almost as bad as spiders from low-budget SyFy/Asylum films and the infamously terrible ones in the 'IT' mini-series). Really hated the end credits too, they go well overboard with the nausea-inducing surrealism and the overbearing music and as an epileptic it made me feel uncomfortable.Despite some intriguing moments and sporadic amusing moments early on, most of the script (especially for the characters played by Le Blanc and Graham and in the third act) is in 'Batman and Robin'-like cornball and cringe territory. Target audience is an issue, being too silly and trying too hard and failing to be cute for adults and with heavy-handed sermonising and family values to appeal properly to younger children, who will also find some of the ideas (like the time travel elements and most of the final third) going over their heads (and no this is coming from somebody who finds children's taste and intelligence for film under-estimated).The film is far too long and drags to dreary degrees in most of its later stages. Most of the time things are taken too seriously and fun and charm can barely be seen anywhere. Then there is the final act which undoes 'Lost in Space' significantly, where things just get weird, tonally muddled, nonsensical and borderline incoherent, far more so than the second half of Season 3 of the show.Overall, not THAT bad but very lacking in most departments. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Lost in Space
1,Leofwine_draca,Family sci-fi with endless adventure and zero thrills,4,18 August 2016,"Here's a brain dead blockbuster which is pretty to look at but fails to engage the brain whatsoever. Fans of the '60s television series who are curious to find out how this filmed version holds up would be wise to give it a miss, as it's just an excuse for lots of cool special effects and not a lot else. Once again the plot seems to have been made up as they went along and is full of holes and indiscrepancies. Things get really bizarre at the end of the film, in which the script writers seemed to dig themselves into a hole and then decide to confuse the audience with technobabble to get them out of it again. By that time I really didn't care and was praying for the obnoxiously sentimental characters to get brutally butchered by a marauding horde of space-spiders.Where to begin with the faults of the cast? (I guess we can't just blame the actors, as the dialogue and characterisation is terrible and contrived too). William Hurt takes the lead as John Robinson, and never has a character been so dull! Truly this guy sent me to sleep every time he opened his monotonous voice. His wife is played by Mimi Rogers, one-time star of THE X-FILES, who flounders aimlessly in a nothing role. Matt LeBlanc is the Robinson's pilot (he can't be a family member as you have to have romance in there too) and is as you would expect, a good-looking but bone-headed meat head who looks good in his space costume but fails to create a realistic character. Heather Graham lends her fragile beauty to the film as Judy Robinson, a daughter, but she has basically nothing to do in the story other than flirt with LeBlanc.For some reason there are lots of extraneous family members added into the story in order to make it appeal to each and every age (we've got child, early teen, 20-somethings and middle-aged folk - what happened to the token old or black person though?). Most grating of all is the incredibly irritating Penny Robinson, played by Lacey Chabert. Penny spends the film speaking into her video camera and is played as a stereotypical dumb American girl. I was seriously ready to kill her by the end of the film. Jack Johnson is the annoying cute kid Will Robinson, the less said about him the better. The only character I did like was Gary Oldman as the evil baddie Zachary Smith. Despite the fact that he mumbles half of his lines, Oldman is still good value as the unlucky bad character who I ended up rooting for unsurprisingly. Edward Fox also appears to disgrace himself in a cameo appearance along with a few returning original cast members.The action sequences are well-staged but flashy, enlivened by some excellent special effects work (especially the alien spiders and the spider-thing that Smith turns into at the end of the movie). Not so great is the CGI used to animate the space sequences which just looks tacky. The CGI used to portray minor things - like the helmet which rolls down over LeBlanc's head - looks much more impressive. Basically the film has no plot, just scene after scene of the family being menaced by irritating robots and aliens and fighting for their lives. You know already that nobody is going to die, this being a family-orientated movie, so that suspense is ruined as well. And whoever thought to include the obnoxious alien monkey should be shot dead on the spot. LOST IN SPACE is an extremely light weight, flashy sci-fi story with good effects but nothing else.",Lost in Space
2,SnoopyStyle,clumsy reboot of TV show,4,15 December 2014,"It's the year 2058. The United Global Space Force is building a Hypergate to travel to another planet. Wars have left the Earth almost uninhabitable. Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) is a fighter pilot protecting the Hypergate from a terrorist group called the Global Sedition. The Robinson family (William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert, Jack Johnson) are traveling to Alpha Prime to build a Hypergate on the other side. Major West is brought in to fly the spaceship. Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) is paid by the Sedition to sabotage the spaceship but is doublecross and left stunned on board the ship.There are many things that don't make sense. Why send a family? The spaceship is horribly unaerodynamic which makes launching it like that really stupid. It's trying to adapt a campy 60s sci-fi TV show to be a gritty futuristic space action thriller. It loses everything from the original without gaining much in return. Matt LeBlanc to trying to do Joey by hitting on Heather Graham while her father is right next to them. LeBlanc's character insists on making jokes. Then the movie keeps taking dark turns. Just when things seem to settle down to a good thriller, they throw in a CG space monkey. Jar Jar Binks anyone? If Earth sent another ship, why not go to Alpha Prime themselves? In fact, why would the Robinsons run into that ship in all of space? So many questions, so few answers.",Lost in Space
3,lee_eisenberg,"having seen this movie, I feel lost",2,29 June 2005,"I've never seen the old ""Lost in Space"" TV series. But if this movie is any indication, there's little reason to check the series out. The movie is at best silly, and at worst embarrassing. Little more than another story about battles and adventures in outer space, the whole thing wastes several great actors and actresses. And was that robot supposed to be obnoxious? If so, then they succeeded. I can't believe that I actually spent money to watch this. But what can you say? Movies based on classic TV shows usually suck (think ""The Flinstones"", ""The Avengers"", ""I Spy"" and apparently ""Bewitched""). Oh well. We can take comfort in the fact that most people didn't see this movie.",Lost in Space
4,jboothmillard,Lost in Space,3,12 September 2005,"I saw this film a couple of times when I was younger, back then I thought it was quite fun, seeing it again when older I realise it is a daft adaptation of a cult classic television series, from director Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, The Reaping). Basically it is year 2058, and soon Earth will be uninhabitable after irreversible effects of pollution and global warming, therefore Professor John Robinson (William Hurt) is leading the Jupiter 2 Mission travelling into outer space to the further planet called Alpha Prime where life can continue. The lead scientist is taking his whole family along too, wife Dr. Maureen Robinson (Mimi Rogers), and the children, eldest Dr. Judy Robinson (Heather Graham), and the youngsters Penny (Mean Girls' Lacey Chabert, also voiced Meg Griffin in Family Guy, before Mila Kunis) and Will (Jack Johnson). Also joining the mission is fighter pilot Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) who helped with the hypergate defence force, the gate will eventually be used to transport space crafts to the new planet instantly. The mission begins and the ship takes off, with everybody being cryogenically frozen for the ten year journey, however sinister Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) sabotages the mission by having the ship robot try and kill the family. They manage to wake up and stop him, but when the destroyed parts of the ship stop them navigating, and they are forced to go into hyperspace being pulled into the sun, they end up lost in space. They come across a spaceship wreck, and hope to find salvation and co-ordinates of where they are and how to get to Alpha Prime, but it seems to be a deserted ship from the future. On the ship they pick up an alien monkey like creature Penny calls Blarp, and a swarm of deadly space spiders nearly attack them, and Will loses the robot in the process. Soon after they crash land on a near planet, and they are stuck there until the stuff on top of the ship is moved, and there is time to investigate a giant bubble which appears to be able to propel them into a further future. So John and Don go into the bubble, and they seem to be transported to a future where the ship crashed, an older Will (Jared Harris), and with Smith and young Will following behind Smith sees that the rest of the family are dead. After escaping this bubble future world, and a mutated spider creature Smith (also Goldman), John and the family are reunited, John obviously shows his love for his young son, and they got off the planet, and use the co-ordinates they collected to speed to Alpha Prime. Also starring Mark Goddard as General, Lennie James as Jeb Walker, June Lockhart as Principal Cartwright and Edward Fox as Businessman. The performances are all daft accompanied by a daft script with too many cheesy and predictable moments, the special effects are modest, but they don't change anything about how terrible and annoying it is, a silly family science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel. Adequate!",Lost in Space
5,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Lost In Space',4,13 October 2006,"Much of today's cliché-type characters and attitudes that you see in modern movies are in this film.....most of which are bad. Too bad, because this could have been a really nice family and funny film. It still was pretty good.THE BAD - First off, the cliché characters (1) Obnoxious kids with a punk- looking teenage girl (Lacey Chabert) and (2) a know-it-all younger brother (Jack Johnson); (3) a father who has ignored his kids for too long; (4) women always having the last say in arguments with men; (5)men looking stupidly macho and uncaring.In addition: (1) Some really dumb and annoying dialog; (2) no reliance on God in any situation; (3) the usual sexual innuendos (despite this being promoted for a family film); (4) cheap shots at marriage and wholesome things, in general.THE GOOD - It features some excellent and unique special-effects; the film moves well despite the length of it (over two hours); the father does look good in the end and the family ""bonds"" are stronger through the ordeal, and, good triumphs over evil. The language is tame in here, too.",Lost in Space
6,Tweekums,Flawed sci-fi,5,3 January 2010,"Apart from a few clips I had not watched the original series so didn't think I'd have too many preconceived ideas but was immediately surprised when the opening scene featured a CGI space battle which included some of the cheesiest dialogue imaginable, here we are introduced to Maj. Don West a gung-ho fighter pilot who disobeys orders to save a friend. We are then introduced to the various members of the Robinson family who are due to go on a ten year mission to a habitable planet so they could build a hypergate to enable future travellers to get there almost instantly. After the original pilot is killed by terrorists Major West is given the job even though he considers himself over-skilled for such a routine job.The mission doesn't go according to plan because terrorist Dr Smith has sabotaged the ship's robot so that it will kill the crew and destroy the ship once the crew are in hypersleep... things don't go as planned when he is double crossed and left trapped on the ship; in order to save himself he is force to wake the crew. The manage to save themselves but in doing so they are forced to make a blind hyperspace jump that leaves them completely lost. Strangely they soon find a derelict spaceship that is clearly from Earth but not of a design they recognise. What follows involves fighting strange space-spiders and after crashing on a planet they find a time bubble which suggests their futures will be rather bleak.While the film wasn't terrible it certainly wasn't as good as it could have been; much of the dialogue was poor, the CGI looked dated, especially the space-monkey which they found on the derelict ship that looked like a cartoon character rather than a living creature. Strangely my biggest complaint is about the costume design; the suits they wore for hyper sleep looked out of place in a film aimed at a family audience as they were clearly designed to show off the female crew members' breasts... this was rather creepy in the case of the daughter who was played by a sixteen year old. It would be unfair not to also point out the films strong points; the cast did a decent job and the story was fairly exciting with plenty of action and the strange space spiders were fairly creepy and may scare younger viewers... but not too much.Overall I would not recommend buying this unless it is very cheap but it passes a couple of hours well enough on television if you haven't seen it before. If it hadn't been based on a previously popular TV series I suspect it would been straight to DVD or even a TV movie.",Lost in Space
7,ma-cortes,A family is assigned to the habitable planet Alpha Prime to prepare it for colonization by building a hypergate in orbit,4,11 July 2012,"In the year 2058 Earth is suffering of pollution and will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of global warming. Space colony family struggles to survive when a spy/accidental stowaway throws their ship hopelessly off course. Professor John Robinson (William Hurt), his wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers) , their children Judy (Heather Graham) , Penny (Lacey Chabert) and Will (Jack Johnson) and Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc , Sean Patrick Flanery was originally cast and was also previously offered to Matthew Perry) are selected to go to the third planet in the Alpha Centauri star system to establish a colony so that other Earth people can settle there. They are to go there on a ship christened the Jupiter 2. However, Doctor Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) , an agent for an enemy (Edward Fox) , is sent to sabotage the mission. He is successful in reprogramming the ship's robot, but in the process becomes trapped on the ship , the ship and all on board become hopelessly lost and it now becomes a fight for survival as the crew tries to find their way back home . Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home .Familiar Sci-Fi dealing with Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity , it is plenty of special effects , thrills , action though regularly developed . The picture has some good moments here and there , but is also full of flaws and gaps . Screenplay by Akiva Goldsman who wrote a script with absurd situations and embarrassing scenes. Silly and ridiculous images , especially starred by the computer monkey made by means of botching effects and the giant spider-Doctor Smith too . Mediocre performances and all principals actors were contracted to a three picture option, but as the film failed to recoup its budget in North America, plans for a new franchise were scrapped . Good photography by cinematographer Peter Levy who frequently works with the filmmaker . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Bruce Broughton . The motion picture was middling directed by Stephen Hopkins who has realized some acceptable Sci-Fi and Terror films as ¨Nightmare in ElmStreet 5 ¨ , ¨Predator 2¨, ¨The reaping ¨ , though his better films were ¨The ghost and the darkness¨ and ¨The life and death of Peter Sellers¨. ¨Lost in space¨ turns out to be his worst movie . Rating : Below average .The classic and best version results to be 84 episodes for television produced by Irwin Allen , starred by Guy Williams (John Robinson) , June Lockhart ( Maureen Robinson) , Mark Goddard (Maj. Don West), Marta Kristen (Judy Robinson) , Bill Mumy ( Will Robinson) and Angela Cartwright . (Penny Robinson).Originally, all surviving cast members of the TV show were meant to have cameo appearances. Mark Goddard, the original Major Don West, plays the General. June Lockhart,plays Will Robinson's principal , Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright play reporters and Dick Tufeld reprises his role from Lost in Space as the voice of the Robot. Ironically, Bill Mumy and Jonathan Harris, the two actors most supportive of the idea of a new movie , did not appear in it.",Lost in Space
8,BA_Harrison,The rise and fall of Matt LeBlanc...,3,24 January 2019,"Friends star Matt LeBlanc started and ended his career as a leading man in big budget summer blockbusters with this overblown family-oriented sci-fi from director Stephen Hopkins, whose 'almost Hollywood major-league' status also took a severe battering. Working from a charmless script, Hopkins delivers a loud, chaotic mess of a movie that no amount of expensive special effects can hope to save.LeBlanc plays war hero Major Don West, who is given the job of setting the Jupiter 2 spacecraft on its course to Alpha Prime, where the other crew members, the Robinson family, are to prepare the planet for colonisation. Having successfully piloted the craft into space, West joins the Robinsons in cryogenic sleep, unaware that terrorist and unwilling stowaway Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) has programmed the ship's robot to sabotage the mission.As well as LeBlanc's less than stellar performance, and a horribly hammy turn from Oldman, we get a pre-sexy Lacy Chabert as shrill teenager Penny Robinson, a post-sexy Mimi Rogers as the mother, mid-sexy Heather Graham as older daughter Judy, Jack Johnson as irritating child genius Will Robinson, and a miscast William Hurt as leader of the family, Professor John Robinson. Even with two future Oscar winners on board (Hurt and Oldman) this adventure for the passengers of the Jupiter 2 is destined to crash and burn, the muddled script resorting to hackneyed sci-fi claptrap such as time travel to try and dig itself out of a (black) hole.Perhaps the worst thing about the whole sorry affair are the lame CGI creatures: cute alien Blawp, blatantly designed to sell Lost In Space merchandising to the kids; crappy, supposedly scary space spiders that attack our heroes; and a mutant arachnoid Gary Oldman that looked really bad even when the film was first released, and which looks positively awful by today's standards.The best thing about the film is its theme music by Apollo 440: not only is it a great track, but it heralds the closing credits and an end to this farrago.3/10.",Lost in Space
9,hitchcockthelegend,There's a lot of space out there to get lost in: and a lot of plot too.,5,2 November 2010,"Lost In Space is based on the popular Irwin Allen 1960s TV show of the same name. It's directed by Stephen Hopkins and stars William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Lacey Chabert, Matt Le Blanc, Heather Graham & Gary Oldman. Plot finds the Robinson family and fighter pilot Dan West, erm, lost in space as they search to save humanity. So yeah, the Swiss Family Robinson in outer space.Big budget & big bangs as another TV series gets the big screen treatment. Not being familiar with the show myself, I have nothing from which to mark this against. I went in just looking for some sci-fi entertainment and a chance to give my home cinema package a good work out. On those levels the film most definitely works, but it's too long, too chocked with babble and unsure of what it wants to be. Starting out as narratively serious sci-fi, with heavy family ties, the film then lurches from humour to effects extravagance at frequent intervals. Something that's not helped by a wayward cast and a pointless CGI cuddly thing.William Hurt is a fine actor, but here he takes it too seriously. Oldman on the other hand plays it right, and gets the best lines into the bargain. Rogers and the young kids do OK, with future Mean Girl Chabert showing good charisma. But Le Blanc is just dull: yes we loved him in Friends, there a handsome Lothario like dope worked, here it gets tiresome very quickly. While Graham is badly miscast as a smart Doctor type. Visually the piece is very appealing, with one or two genuine moments of brilliance; such as young Will Robinson controlling the robot to fight a gazillion spiders. But for all the eye candy and aural delights on offer, Lost In Space is hamstrung by trying to be too much. With the added weight of expectation of launching a franchise too much for the writers to contend with.It was a box office success in spite of receiving mostly bad reviews from the critics. The planned sequel, as yet, hasn't materialised. That's probably for the best if the same people involved were meant to come back again. OK while it's on, if the running time doesn't give you itchy feet, but ultimately it's pretty forgettable once it's over. 5.5/10",Lost in Space
10,Theo Robertson,Lost The Place More Like,4,25 March 2005,"As I type this review I've a confession that I am very , very excited about the return of DOCTOR WHO tomorrow evening . Yeah it won't be like the old show since the FX look much better and the new Doctor is played by a cool actor with a northern accent and there's even fart jokes ! , but the old elements of a time traveler in a space ship disguised as an old London police box with a sexy assistant saving the universe from evil scary monsters remain .The big screen version of LOST IN SPACE is quite different and if you've ever seen an episode of the old TV show you come to the conclusion that you've seen at least one episode more than the producers of this movie . In fact I'll be cynical and say it's only called LOST IN SPACE to cash in on people who remember the original series ."" Have no fear Smith is here "" That's the tag line from the camp and cowardly character from the original , without doubt the most watchable and best remembered character from the show . So why's Gary Oldman playing the same character he did in LEON ? Gary Oldman ? If you're needing a camp but watchable Brit why didn't they cast Richard E Grant ? Probably because no one involved in this movie has ever seen an episode of LOST IN SPACE . The characters share nothing in common with their small screen predecessors apart from their names If the producers hadn't cheated and released this movie with its true title of JUST ANOTHER SF BLOCKBUSTER I guess people wouldn't have been so critical . Okay it's nothing special , just a rather loud movie with explosions and special effects that looked like it was directed by Michael Bay but not really worthy of so much negativity either . But at the end of the day it's like watching a DOCTOR WHO story without sexy assistants and monsters",Lost in Space
11,preppy-3,Already forgotten,4,27 August 2004,"I went to see this in a movie theatre in 1998. I had fond memories of the TV show from when I was a kid. It started off OK with the four cameos of the original cast--then it careened out of control.The plot was a jumble of different ideas--none of them good or original. It ended up not making a whole lot of sense. There was SEVERE miscasting in this film. I have nothing nothing against Matt LeBlanc and William Hurt---but in a big budget SCI-FI ACTION FILM????!!!! Seriously...who thought this was a good idea? My audience actually laughed out loud when LeBlanc grabbed a gun and TRIED to look aggressive and in charge. Hurt, on the other hand, acted drugged out. I thought at least Gary Oldman would be good as Dr. Smith. WRONG!! He, for some reason, underplays the part terribly (but it was cool to hear his ""Doomed"" thing at the end). The special effects were good but this movie was miscast, badly plotted and REALLY overdone. When it ended Penny Robinson said ""This mission sucks!"". The guy next to me said ""Exactly"". The audience hated the film--most walked out giggling. Only 6 years later this film has already been forgotten. THAT should tell you something. Avoid.",Lost in Space

13,poolandrews,"""There's a lot of space out there to get lost in."" Enjoyable enough big budget reworking of an old TV series.",6,22 December 2009,"Lost in Space starts during the year 2058 as Earth's natural resources are quickly running out, within a couple of decades Earth will not be able to support human life anymore. As such an ambitious expedition to colonise an Earth like planet named Alpha Prime has been set-up, Professor John Robinson (William Hurt) & his family intend to travel through space for ten years to reach Alpha Prime where he will construct a hyperspacial gate that will allow instantaneous travel between the two planets, joining the family is Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) who is there to pilot the state of the art ship called the Jupiter II. However a saboteur named Dr Zachery Smith (Gary Oldman) has sneaked aboard & programs a large robot to destroy the Robinson family & the Jupiter II but when he is trapped aboard as the Jupiter II takes off his plans change but the robot still causes huge damage to the ship & they become lost in space trying to find a way to complete their mission...Produced & directed by Stephen Hopkins this was a big budget Hollywood adaptation of the cult US TV series Lost in Space (1965 - 1968) that ran for eighty-four episodes back in the 60's, this has quite a bad reputation but I have to say I liked most of it & would go so far as to say I actually enjoyed it. The original series & this Hollywood sci-fi action adventure share the same name, character's & basic premise but the tone is different as this is played very straight with little or no humour. At over two hours in length Lost in Space goes on for maybe ten or fifteen minutes too long & while the first ninety odd minutes are great stuff the final third is rather dull & drags too, a sub-plot about time travel kicks in & it all becomes a bit confusing with various plot holes & questions left unanswered as well as a horrible moment in which the old Will Robinson suddenly realises after twenty years that the huge giant mutant monster thing isn't his friend after all & this time travel subplot feels tacked on & unnecessary. Uptil that point Lost in Space is a cracking space adventure with enough heart & message to even have a little meaning as well, there are some great scenes like the finding & exploring of the deserted Proteus, a space battle at the start, a spectacular launch, a huge robot going crazy & firing laser beams everywhere, mutant alien spiders, a crash landing & the Jupiter II being pulled towards the sun in a frantic battle to escape it's heat to name just a few. The dynamic between the family members is a little clichéd (the dad not spending enough time with his kids, scientist & soldier not agreeing with each other, brother & sister constantly teasing each other) & I really could have done without that comic relief silly looking alien monkey thing but overall I reckon there's more than enough here to keep one entertained even if it is a bit longish & the time travel aspect is poorly handled.I watched this on DVD last night & maybe a Hi-Def Blu-ray might show the combination of CGI computer & practical model effects up a bit more I actually thought they were mostly excellent, from the spaceships to the huge explosions to the alien spiders to a cool climax where West has to pilot the Jupiter II through the core of a planet as it breaks up although there is one major flaw which lets them down, the Zachery spider monster which frankly looks terrible. Not only is this spider mutant thing poorly designed the CGI effects are awful & unfortunately that's probably the thing most people will remember about the film, the one awful effect rather than the dozens of excellent ones. The production design is also worthy of mention as this is a great looking film that obviously had a lot of time & money spent on it, the sleek curved interiors of the spaceships or the cool computer interfaces & graphics & the various alien planet landscapes & such look great & really hold up well even when viewed today (or yesterday as I did...).With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 this was shot here in the UK in London & was meant to kick off a franchise but despite being the film that knocked the mighty Titanic (1997) off the top spot in the box-office charts it did moderate business & no further films were made. Most of the original TV series cast have cameos here while the acting overall is pretty good William Hurt does make for a somewhat forgettable John Robinson although the good news is neither kid is that annoying.Lost in Space is a big budget reworking of a creaky not as good as many remember TV series that keeps the basics & updates it for a modern audience, I liked it & if it wasn't for the terrible CGI on the spider mutant & the drab time travel plot I'd have given this a solid seven but it's still worth a closer to seven than five six. A TV pilot called The Robinsons: Lost in Space (2004) directed by John Woo of all people was made but remains unaired to this day & a series was never made.",Lost in Space
14,utgard14,I Hope They Stay Lost,4,14 June 2014,"Well, let's dismiss comparisons to the TV series right away. This couldn't be more different than that. The family here is a dysfunctional group of barely likable people. I suppose this is an effort to make the characters more 'modern.' Well, if this how modern families act I think I will take the nuclear family of yesteryear, no matter how cheesy it could be at times. The script is corny but you might not notice since everything is buried behind gobs of special effects. None of those effects or the action scenes are that impressive. How about those costumes with the plastic sculpted boobs for the women AND the men? Ridiculous.The cast is mixed. William Hurt and Mimi Rogers are pros and both try to rise above the material. The kids are worse. Gary Oldman adds some flair to things, chewing scenery like there's no tomorrow. That's a forgivable sin in a movie such as this. At least it gives you something to watch that isn't boring or infuriating. The weakest part of the movie is Joey from Friends. He acts in such a smug, self-unaware way that I just wanted to reach through the screen and punch him. That sort of thing might work on a TV sitcom but when you're actually trying to, you know, ACT -- it makes you look like a rank amateur that has no business in a theatrically-released movie. Also his flirting with Heather Graham was nauseating. Were these two supposed to have good chemistry? Because they don't. Why was this over two hours? Did they really think they had such a good movie that audiences wouldn't want it to end? It's not fun, smart, or interesting.

17,Boba_Fett1138,Uninteresting shallow science-fiction flick.,5,15 April 2006,"This remake of the successful '60's television show really is a waste of some good potential. It by no means is an horrible movie but the script isn't really interesting or spectacular and the character treatment is quite poor.In a way this movie is a mixed bag. On the one hand it has some good actors in it and some of the special effects are really good but than again on the other hand the story is pretty shallow, the costumes are embarrassingly dreadful and some of the special effects are below average at best. Sounds weird, a movie that has both good and bad special effects in it. It's a bit weird, it's like they spend most of the time on the big special effects shots and after that they raffled the rest of the special effects. At times the movie is impressive to watch and at other moments it's just laughable bad to look at. Such as the CG character Blarp. He (or she?) looked absolutely dreadful and it made the movie even more ridiculous and bad to watch. But perhaps worst thing about the entire character is that it's a totally, completely unnecessary one that doesn't add anything to the story at all.The movie has a solid cast. John Hurt certainly adds some believability to the silly moments in the movie and he deliverers some of the bad dialog good and even credible. Gary Oldman is of course also a great actor but he plays a bit of an uninteresting villain in this movie that doesn't get enough opportunity to shine. Matt LeBlanc is most of the time convincing in his role but he at times deliver some cheesy dialog which doesn't always make him believable as a tough space pilot. Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham also walk around in the movie but they get very little interesting to do. Good in her role was also Lacey Chabert. She's a good young actress, never really understood why she didn't appeared in more mainstream big Hollywood productions. She's an actress with great potential but somehow Hollywood never really picked this up. Maybe it has something to do with the failure of this movie?Because yes, this movie is a bit of a failure. Not only in terms of how well it did at the box office and how well it was received by the crowd and critics but also certainly in terms of how the movie is constructed. The script is just disappointingly shallow and has some totally unlikely and unbelievable events in it, that at times don't even make sense. The story also uses too many elements from the first Star Wars trilogy and even a little bit from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It doesn't only uses story elements from that movies, it also rips off the looks of some of the spaceships, planets and city skylights. No, ""Lost in Space"" certainly isn't the most original science-fiction movie ever made.The movie also lacks some good tension and action sequences. There are too many slow moments in the movie in which totally nothing happens. It's OK to have some slower moments in a movie but only when the script and characters are good and interesting enough to carry those slower moments. In this movie that really isn't the case.This movie is not a complete disaster and the 4.6 rating here at the moment might be a bit too harsh. The movie does provide some good and entertaining moments. But if only the movie had a better and more original script, than this movie perhaps would had been a bigger success and certainly a better one to watch.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Lost in Space
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Decent special effects for a bland, immature Disney sci-fi movie",5,17 January 2004,"When I sat down to watch this, I was expecting somewhat of a kid's movie. I just had no idea it was this bad. All of the humor, except maybe three lines, is incredibly immature, even more childish than the typical Disney humor. The plot is too complicated to understand for most kids, and too ridiculous to take seriously for adults. It also seemed too keen on preaching the more or less proved fact that sooner or later, Earth will not be inhabitable anymore. Most grown-up people know that, we don't need a bad sci-fi movie preaching it to us. The effects probably looked good back in 1998, but now they look horribly dated, which is a big problem since half of the film is the effects. The acting is horrible, the only person who conveyed a good performance was Gary Oldman, everyone else were wooden and unbelievable; the worst were the children, but the adult actors weren't a hell of a lot better. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody, as it's too hard to understand for kids, and too boring and predictable to adults. 5/10",Lost in Space
19,neil-476,Not one for the Nostalgia Generation,7,15 March 2011,"When Hollywood turns to the TV Mine to see what it can dig up, the general rule is to try to do something which recaptures the essence of the TV original, albeit tweaked in some sort of fashion so as to bring it up to date. But sometimes there is an attempt to give a twist to the original - to dress it in clothes which are not so much new as entirely different. And so we have Starsky and Hutch as a comedy, Bewitched actually featuring a TV remake of the original but with a real witch, and so on.Lost In Space has, thankfully, forgone the overriding two-set (one interior, one exterior) studio-bound obviousness of its TV progenitor. It has also lost Robbie the Robot (his update is a lot less sympathetic than the original), and weaselly serial complainer Dr Zachary Smith. Much as I enjoyed Jonathan Harris' portrayal, it was essentially a comedy role, albeit with the capacity for introducing the element of dramatic tension in a serial drama which was so resolutely formulaic.Gary Oldman's Dr Smith is an entirely different animal. The TV Smith was irksome, a nuisance, and could cause some damage. The movie Smith is dark, dangerous, and potentially fatal.There are plot elements introduced which are fun and, in some respects, original. Most of the visuals are excellent (although I found the cute but hugely unconvincing CGI critter irritating). Most of the cast are good (with some interesting dynamics between the characters), although I found Lacey Chabert's squeaky pre-teen even more irritating than the CGI thingie.On the whole, there is quite a lot here for science fiction space opera fans to like.",Lost in Space

The only thing that was lost in space was common sense but it might have helped if the script got lost too. The Robinson family are launched into space for a mission that mankind depends on but Gary Oldman attempts to sabotage their efforts and ends up stranded on board with them. With a concept with all the excitement of a beer commercial and using Matt Leblanc for the marketing. I had more fun counting the strands of hair on the woman sitting in front of me as oppose to watching this stupid film. Lousy directing by Stephen Hopkins who made The Ghost and the Darkness. Special effects are okay and are perhaps the only payoff. Oldman is a decent actor but only some sort of brand of bad luck could have landed him in this garbage. William Hurt and Mimi Rogers do what they can with the limited personalities given to members of the Robinson family. Heather Graham went from a wonderful performance as Roller Girl in Boogie Nights to this tripe. And of course that star of Friends who is suppose to convince people to spend valuable dollars to see this crap because someone from his sitcom is listed in the cast.

22,Aaron1375,This is pretty much a lost film and franchise.,5,13 December 2011,"I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves ""This looks tolerable"" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the ""let's throw it all in"" approach they seemed to take with this one.

There's this one weird creature they call Blarp who does virtually nothing throughout the entire movie. I honestly have no idea why this character exists. I actually do kind of like the reveal at the end.We see a future version of Dr. Smith who's actually pretty well designed. Of course, he looks ugly when he's entirely CGI. This movie was also just too long. I saw the longest version at 2 hours and 10 minutes. I guess the acting isn't that bad and some of the action scenes are kind of interesting, but it's mostly pointless.

Hurt, Rogers and Oldman are wonderful in their respective roles, while Graham and LaBlanc delight the audience with their wit and charm as the couple who provide the movie's romantic elements. All other cast members are quite fine as well. The production looks nice, too, with great costumes, sets, and special effects. So, that leaves the uneven script. It starts off well, with a quick look at the Robinsons' quest and the plotting of Dr. Smith. There are even some great lines, such as the one Maureen hurls at John and Mark, as they are sparring. ""If you guys are done hosing down the deck with testosterone..."" had me laughing heartily. But, it all just fizzles somewhere in the middle and ends up being utter nonsense, a plot without a cause.

29,The-Sarkologist,A pretty ordinary remake of a pretty ordinary TV series,4,9 June 2013,"There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations.The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot.There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost.This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.",Lost in Space
30,Anonymous_Maxine,HELL yeah. This is some excellent sci-fi.,9,16 March 2001,"Contains spoilers Lost In Space is a tremendously upgraded adaptation of the old campy TV show, in which the Robinson family is, of course, lost in space. The film has an excellent opening battle sequence that nearly rivals anything that George Lucas has ever done and comes close to being as exciting as the opening of any of the James Bond films. It is particularly noteworthy that Matt LeBlanc was able to deliver such a convincing performance as a tremendously skilled fighter pilot, given his popularity from Friends. Lost In Space presents a pretty dismal prediction of the future. The movie takes place (initially) in the year 2058, and John Robinson, the father in the famous Robinson family, has been working for years on a mission to Alpha Prime, a planet which is capable of supporting human life. It seems that in another two decades, Earth will no longer be capable of supporting human life.The wooden performance of William Hurt in the role of John Robinson takes a little getting used to, but overall, he pulls it off very well. Probably the best character in the film is Dr. Zachary Smith, the self proclaimed `monster' of a man that was hired to sabotage the Robinson's mission, played with flawless precision by the brilliant Gary Oldman. It turns out that he is double-crossed himself, and he winds up on the ship with the Robinsons, along with the robot that Smith re-programmed to destroy the family as well as the ship's navigation systems. Science fiction films generally have very weak and simple plots, and it was great to see that this one got interesting so fast.The thing that really causes the family to get lost in space is that they accidentally get caught in the sun's gravitational pull, and because they don't have enough power to escape it, they have to open up the stargate (meant to traverse the tremendous distance between Earth and Alpha Prime instantaneously) and go THROUGH the sun, thus delivering them into an unknown part of space. Lost. The trip through was a little much, but it definitely was cool, and the resulting setting that they find themselves in is just fascinating. And as if a trip to unknown space wasn't enough, they throw in a great time travel element to the story, making it that much more interesting. Almost immediately after shooting though the stargate and finding themselves lost in space, the Robinsons come across a spaceship from Earth, and in the captain's log they find a recording of an old man who says that he `refuses to give up' in his search for the Robinsons. Even though they had only been lost for a matter of hours, this ship had been searching for them for YEARS.While there was some highly entertaining acting in this film, not all of the characters were as well presented and acted as John Robinson and Dr. Smith and Major Don West (LeBlanc).  Mimi Rogers provided an effective and believable mother in the family, as well as the life sciences expert, but the high pitched Lacey Chabert, the pedophile's dream, got real annoying real quick, and Heather Graham was horribly miscast as Judy Robinson. After several of her previous roles, it would be best if she would avoid taking on a role that is to be taken seriously for quite a while. And there were a few things in the film that didn't make sense. There is the obvious problem (that all Back To The Future fans will notice right away) with the older Will's plan to travel back to the day they left and stop the ship from taking off - you already know that won't happen, because when they left at the beginning of the movie, Will would have shown up and told them not to leave. And how about the scene where Dr. Smith tricks Will into using his voice-print ID on his gun to `enable for all users,' only to have Smith turn it on him? Wouldn't it have been just as easy for Will to use the voice ID to turn the gun off while it was pointed at him? Seems that such a smart kid would have realized that all he had to do was talk to the gun in order to eliminate all danger.Lost In Space is also famous for its ludicrous amount of special effects and, surprisingly enough, they were very well done and very effective. Obviously, special effects are mandatory for a space movie, but they are most often screwed up so badly that they ruin the movie (see: Mission To Mars). In this movie, though, the special effects have the unique distinction of being both way overdone and very effective - with the exception of that damn alien monkey that doesn't look real in a single frame in the entire film and is also totally unnecessary. The only thing that really took a lot away from the film was the transformed Dr. Smith at the end of the film. Sure, it was a cool idea that he got transformed into one of the spiders in true vampire form after having been scratched by one, but the cartoonish creature that he turned into was just too far, even for this otherwise high-quality science fiction movie. A lot of things are never clarified, like how Will (who sure grew up to be an ugly guy) comes up with the tools necessary to build time traveling warp zones and whatnot, but it doesn't really matter that this isn't explained. This is usually not good, but Lost In Space is an unusually well made science fiction thriller that is fun for all ages, so it can get away with a lot of stuff like that. The tremendous gap at the end of this film makes it pretty obvious that at least one sequel is inevitable, and we can only hope that any sequels live up to the original.",Lost in Space

She's good for some things, but her presence in this production is NOT a plus. And Lacey Chabert? Not only did she make the character aggravating, but her performance was horrid. I normally would not trash a child's performance, but like Courtland Mead in Stephen King's authorized version of The Shining, Lacey Chabert is whiny, superfluous, and inept.The effects of Spider/Smith are cheesy and obvious CGI. I don't mind even a heavy use of CGI, but it MUST be done with skill, or it destroys much of the work. But here, it barely even mattered.The casting, the story, and the execution were pretty awful.

Irwin is really not good with scripts; he is a tech-heavy producer. This results in extremely boring dialogue. Irwin is not happy unless there is a crisis every ten minutes on the screen. Films like Moon and The Martian have proved that Irwin's style is obsolete and simple-minded. I was able to do the dishes, the laundry and get lunch ready before the merciful completion of this turkey. Too long for Mystery Science Theater 3000, and hopefully will actually become lost in time and space. I would have mentioned Matt LaBlanc, but I only critique actors, not one-trick ponies.",Lost in Space

Don West, my favourite character in the movie, he came with his cool gun & battle helmet & a space spider, it was so cool!!! Anyway i think This very 90's big budget summer blockbuster is perfect adventure entertainment & is pretty much exactly what the ""Summer Blockbuster"" is all about.The computer effects are pretty bad now but hey it's a product of it's time & gives it it's 90's charm!!!
Matt LeBlanc is Awesome in his only ever real lead hero role, here he plays handsome & cocky all American battle pilot Major. Don West & hes great, funny & charming, makes me wonder why his Career didn't take off? He will always be remembered for his role as Joey Tribbiani from the t.v show ""Friends"" but it's a shame because he's great in his lead action hero role here & his bit where he's battle armoured-up with his laser gun shooting, as he's running while hundreds of space spiders are chasing him through an abandoned old space ship is the most exciting sequence in the whole movie.""Lost in Space"" has a good ensemble cast with Gary Oldman, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert, William Hurt, Jack Johnson & Mimi Rogers rounding out the ""Robinson"" family, except Gary Oldman who plays the villain aboard their ship, Dr. Smith. All perform fine but Matt LeBlanc steals the show in every scene.
Apart from the now tacky looking c.g.i (especially the space monkey) everything else is excellent from high production design & a solid sense of Adventure in it's great music score, it's directed fine by the underrated Stephen Hopkins, who I'm a fan of for his excellent ""Predator 2"" & his Brilliant ""Judgment Night"" both underrated 90's Cult Classic films.We all know the story of the Robinson family that gets ""Lost in Space"" & it's a great set-up for a thrilling sci-fi adventure that is fairly harmless in it's pure 90's charming way, it's got funny moments & plenty of cool action scenes, it's a great piece of fun entertainment & i just love it.A really well made & just enjoyable watching experience & the type of film that is so re-watchable, awww Nostalgia & a very cool Matt LeBlanc",Lost in Space

36,Samiam3,Lost indeed I'm afraid,5,29 August 2010,"Lost in Space is a case of one Movie that feels like two, and both of them have problems. In the first hour, the Robinsson family embark on a mission to begin colonization of a distant planet deigned suitable for human habitation. Little do they know that a spy has sabotaged the ship. The five Robinssons come out of hyper sleep early only to find themselves being chased by the ships droids and the ship itself heading strait for the sun. Using hyperdrive, they escape only to become lost in an unknown corner of the universe.This portion of the movie is PG material, family suitable, but it feels like a thing of the past. It is cartoonish, and stiff, and offers visual effects which appear half finished and way under dressed (to put it lightly). At times the movie is actually painful to look at. You feel like you are watching an early nintento video game, not a hundred million dollar motion picture. The art department seems to have some good arts and ideas (I love the robot),but a lot of the furniture and set pieces look like they just came out of the box. They could use some ageing. At the one hour mark, Lost in Space becomes something else. Here there story becomes less family friendly, darker, and ten times more confused. It feels like the makers of Lost in Space are so desperate to please, that they throw in as much story material as they can in the hope that it will be epic. Instead it feels muddled and overlong. Gary Oldman's transformation into a ten foot extra terrestrial arachnid is amusing, and the robot gets a few good lines, but otherwise this section is sloppy almost beyond description.The performance quality across the board is hammed up. Anyone who admires William hurt will be crushed by Lost in Space I think. On another matter seems to have lost half his body weight, possibly in the hope that he will look better in a skin tight rubber suit that way. Lost in Space is exactly what this film is, and I'm sure I'm not the first to say it. With that said however, I won't argue that it's unwatchable. At times it can be cute or quirky. It gets off to a descent start in fact, but the journey does not prove to be a competent adventure",Lost in Space
37,davidmvining,The Work of a Committee of Madmen,3,20 July 2021,"I don't know what psychopath decided to spend so much money on a movie version of Lost In Space, but I can say that the completely heedless application of money, special effects, and ornate set design represents the only joys in this completely misguided first step in trying to create a new franchise from a quaint, old television show. The story itself is such a giant jumble of ideas and an ensemble all working in different directions that nothing settles into a groove long enough for an audience to latch onto narratively. It's not a completes slog, though. It's fast pace means that the wild special effects (all in their late 90s CGI glory) keep changing enough so that there are at least new sights pretty frequently.It's obvious that something is wrong in the opening seconds of the film. William Hurt, who plays the patriarch of the Jupiter II mission John Robinson, does a flat voiceover narration of the geopolitical situation on Earth. It would be functional as a text crawl, but coming from Hurt it feels unnatural. Then we get an action scene. I'm wary of movies beginning with action scenes before anything else. They're usually off tonally because they insist on the audience sharing an emotional sense of danger with the characters, but we don't know the characters at all, much less like them. The scene show Major Don West fighting off a pair of seditionist starfighters in his own starfighter along with his best friend, Jeb Walker. If this were just to show us Don's fighter pilot skills then that would be one thing, but it edges too far into earnestness by the end as Don saves Jeb from death, defying orders doing so. This scene defines Don for the rest of the movie, which is good at least in so far as it amounts to pretty much the totality of his character. Oh, he also digs Heather Graham because Heather Graham is pretty. So, there's that.To make the opening sequence worse, it's kind of hard to watch. I don't hold the soft, textureless CGI against 90s CGI as much as some, so the visuals are fine in that regard. The designs are unique, which is nice as well, but the fighter pilot pods have so many moving parts and the action is filmed so close, predominantly in closeups, that it becomes incomprehensible. This movie simply starts on the wrong foot.Then we get our introductions to the rest of the characters, and it's a lot. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Ensemble pieces are hard. Lost in Space has, for all intents and purposes, seven main characters. There are the five members of the Robinson family, going to the planet Alpha Prime to set up a hyperspace gate to allow for instant travel from Earth to the only inhabitable planet they can detect, John, Maureen, Judy, Penny, and Will, Don West the pilot, and Dr. Zachary Smith, the stowaway. If there's a main character thread in this film, it's about John being unable to connect with Will because he's so busy preparing for the mission. That's as good a backbone for a story as anything, but it's lost in the other stories. West dealing with the fact that he's not piloting his fighter anymore while trying to pick up Judy, Penny being a teenage girl while torn from her life to go on a 10 year space mission, and Dr. Smith having tried to sabotage the mission (because he's a sympathizer, or just a mercenary, not quite clear, for the Seditionists) trying to survive. That's a fair amount, all competing for screentime, and they don't really come together in any thematic way. It's a hodgepodge.And then there's the time travel. Okay, so Smith's efforts to destroy the Jupiter II partially succeed, only stopped because the Seditionists somehow turned his personal device into a knockout electronic that kept him asleep through the violent launch while laying in a tunnel without any kind of harness (I mean...he should have died), getting the Robinson family awake quickly enough so that they could deactivate the reprogrammed robot so that they don't die but not so quickly that he doesn't completely wreck their navigation equipment. In a last bid effort to save their lives, they engage the hyperdrive, sending the Jupiter II careening across the galaxy without a set destination. So, they become lost in space.Lost they don't know where, they very quickly find a tear in time (it makes sense later, so I'm fine with this) where they discover a rescue ship that was sent looking for them decades earlier (how the ship managed to find them at all in the first place is unclear), commanded by Jeb. They're quickly attacked by space spiders, Smith gets hit but survives, and West blows up the rescue ship, crashing the Jupiter II on the planet below. I think I know why they went in the direction they did with the time travel. It relates to what should have been the central character-driven storyline about a father having never made time for his son, and there are moments of that in the third act. The ship crashes next to a time bubble, and inside is another Jupiter II, decades older with only Will Robinson having grown into Jared Harris surviving. Why the Jupiter II from the future is a few hundred yards from the current one, I don't know.Anyway, future Will describes a possible future where everyone died from the space spiders but him, and he's spent decades perfecting time travel, trying to send himself back to before he got lost. The secret is that Dr. Smith has also survived in mutated form, becoming a human/spider hybrid. It was Smith who killed the rest of the family and is using Will to send himself back in time to Earth. There could be a connection here between the mutant nature of the Seditionists and the mutant nature of Smith, but the movie makes nothing of it. So, points for trying, I guess? With the planet collapsing around them because of Will's activation of the time machine, the rest of the crew of the Jupiter II try to leave, exploding in the wreckage, and Will decides to send John back to...right before the ship explodes. Not right before, say, the robot goes mad hours into the mission originally or anything because then there would be no story anymore.And this is why time travel is a tricky narrative technique. There's simply way too many ""Why didn't he?"" questions to ask. It creates holes, and it makes me question the use of time travel at all. Time travel is not intimately considered with the original show, as far as I know. The time travel aspect feels like a really complicated extra bit of business to include in a movie already overstuffed with characters fighting for screentime. The actual story needed to be greatly simplified. Weird new sights and sounds without any way of getting home is an interesting enough place to have your story.As I said, though, I do like the look of the film overall. Sure, the CGI has dated horribly, but it's interesting. The spiders look scary. The final design of Spider Smith looks good. The ships and planets look fine. It's a thin reed on which to ask anything of an audience though when the rest is just a tangle.Gary Oldman is having fun as Smith, though. So that's something.",Lost in Space
38,triple8,Just makes me miss the television show all the more.,5,26 June 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:I can see how someone might think Lost In Space is kind of a fun movie. It's all whirlwind special effects and digitally enhanced happenings. But I can also see how someone would not like this at all. It bears little resemblance to the television show ""Lost In Space"". It really makes one miss the TV show, which was absolutely wonderful. This one went the way of safe versus fascinating.The movie is all about one thing after another happening to the lost Robinson family/friends and putting various cast members in harm's way. It's all special effects and while not awful, is certainly not extraordinary. The show ""Lost In Space"" was quite different. You get to know this group as people and there's character development and a lot of depth and soul to the television series. It was one of my favorites growing up and I'd looked forward to the movie version. I should have known this wouldn't be a replica. I think it should have been though, as the TV show is a classic and this had the potential to be an unforgettable movie.The performers were all right though they were not given much to work with. This is an action/space movie, it has little to do with the television show. They work with what they've got. The one who really surprised me however, was Matt Leblanc. When I first saw him in the role, I will admit I thought: whatever were they thinking? Well, I was WRONG. I think he may have actually been the best, he actually reminded me of the original Don West and picked up on both the voice inflection and a lot of the mannerisms.Lost In Space isn't awful or anything but it was a disappointment. I really don't understand why so many movies made from books and TV shows are so changed when they make it to the big screen. Obviously, there's a reason for the success of the original. In any event-I would love to see a new ""Lost In Space"" hit the big screen, one that follows the original more closely and brings the unforgettable TV show back to us in an unforgettable movie version.",Lost in Space
39,onepotato2,hide the map!,3,30 January 2007,"The family film genre is a pretty dreadful thing. As a parent I can understand why you would want some family-affirming material for your brood to view, but I'm also deeply suspect at, if and when, the parent selecting the movies can recognize when the saccharine, facile ideas in family movies are actually retarding your kids (and your own) development. If your family, by projection, is virtuous and united, you can't be much else. ""Virtuous"" and ""united"" aren't especially compelling visual or narrative qualities. Their value is propagandistic. And so the underscoring of the family's virtue & unity squeezes most other qualities (art, ideas, intelligence) offscreen; a tedious endeavor.This movie had an amazing low-key, high-tech, soft-sell of a preview which you can still see on Youtube; It starts in complete ambiguity. A computer alone scans a 3-D database of known planets, and established that something is Lost, at which point the whole preview becomes conventional with a rush of effects and celebrity moments. The preview was compelling to the exact degree that the cast wasn't shown. Audiences didn't exactly burst into cheers and applause when it ended, but you could feel the preview had heightened the excitement of the room, ending as it did with the classic ""Danger Will Robinson"" voice-over. What was pleasing and subtle in the preview is not to be found in the movie.Of the hundreds of mind-numbing ideas in this movie, the two I'll comment on are:Penny & the Blawmp. I commiserate with the state of adolescent females; squeezed as they are out of the marketplace to make way for endless dumb adolescent boy features. But every irritating Penny Robinson, with irritating on-helium-voices (the excruciating Lacey Chabot), who has befriended lame CGI Blawmps, insures that it will be five or more years before an adolescent girl appears on film again. There's Annie, there's Spirited Away and there's this; some crap lineage. Lacey turns this movie into ""Blossom in Space"" with the same sanctimonious, self-impressed, needy, unbearable overacting.The family carapace. The carapace armor follows a body-conscious trend in sci-fi movies that makes it either useful or expressive that the human body should also appear to be automated, or componentialized. But training as it does one's attention on atomized body parts probably isn't appropriate here. Mimi Rogers' steely blue hemispherical boobs should have received their own credit. I imagine there's a reason women don't just stick two chrome hubcaps on their breasts. Following the trend developed in Batman, where the profoundly nonathletic Michael Keaton was rendered firm by a bunch of foam rubber muscles, the entire pasty and unfit Robinson family (William Hurt) has their warrior nature expressed for them in applied musculatures. If the movie had featured a family dog with the foam rubber physique of Steve Reeves, the point would only be a little clarified, about the absurdity of these outfits. They're too sexy for this film or too ridiculous. By the way, boobs aren't muscles... so maybe a different treatment?Cross-pollinating these two heinous ideas produces an anatomically suggestive, metallic bustier on a 14 year old girl, which gets my vote for the most distasteful idea ever to appear on film.After disappearing up his own anus & connecting with no one for twenty years William Hurt is reduced here to playing another constipated dad. He barely registers. I suppose even appearing in this film is an admission of defeat. Gary Oldman carves out another place for himself in this movie as the most ridiculous human being ever to appear on film. I'll pretend I have no negative thoughts on Heather Graham.I have heard Akiva is again to blame for this script. The guy is a no-talent.",Lost in Space

Mat LeBlanc actually surprises me by showing he has some action range, a young Lacey Chabert comes off much more obnoxious than I would have expected, and solid, if expected, performances from William Hurt, Heather Graham, and Gary Oldman.There is just very little that goes beyond expectations. Don't get me wrong there are some very interesting sequences and effects, but just nothing impressive I'm going to remember down the line.In the end I had a good time, and I'd do it again, but I'd rather see a more modern or higher production version of this like ""Voyager"".",Lost in Space
41,lemon_magic,A lot of money and effort spent to mediocre effect,5,14 April 2007,"Even as a wee sprat, I knew that the TV version of ""Lost In Space"" was crap, but I liked to watch anyway because the Robinsons had a bunch of neat toys they got to play with every week: a space ship, an RV, a ""force field"", a ""laser"", and best of all, a ""Robot"" (!!). But basically it was just a Space Opera about an All American family getting caught in a bad neighborhood, and it was obvious even to me that Irwin Allen had no feel (or respect) for a genre that I passionately adored back then. (Note: I read recently that the source of the series was actually the novel ""Space Family Robinson"". For all I know, it might have been very good, but ""SWISS Family Robinson"" was obviously the real source, along with ""Robinson Crusoe"".) 3 decades later, I saw the movie version in the theaters, just for something to do.My reaction was basically, ""Eh."" The acting was mostly higher level (with some major exceptions), the toys and the special effects obviously cost some money, and the screenplay acknowledged the fact that movies like ""Event Horizon"" and ""Outland"" and ""Star Trek II"" had raised the bar in the genre quite a bit...but it was painfully obvious that this was a 2nd rate movie that existed only for its McDonalds' marketing tie-ins and would die in 3 weeks or less. Which it did. 8 years later still, cable aired it again. I feel that some movies seem to ""improve"" with time after their initial viewing, once I know where the good parts are; and sometimes the small screen showcases the movie's strengths better. So I gave ""LS"" another chance. My conclusion: ""Nope, it's still pretty much a waste of time.""How did the filmmakers blow it? Let me count the ways: The whole ""dysfunctional family"" thread backfired. If I understand the basic premise, Dr. Robinson is trying to save the ENTIRE HUMAN RACE with an enormously complex and hazardous expedition, and he even wants to take his family with him - in spite of all the logistical and operational problems it will cause. But all the kids and the wife can do is complain that he seems a bit preoccupied with the project that, and let me repeat this for emphasis, THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE DEPENDS ON. That's just too much whiny 80's revisionism for what is supposed to be a great adventure story la the original ""Swiss Family Robinson"" tale that inspired it. The characters and their actions seem trivial and petty in a story where epic heroism is called for. 2nd problem: Mostly the acting just doesn't gel. Matt LeBlanc is especially off here - half the time he's blandly dashing and handsome...but the other half he's ""Tony"" from ""Friends"", and ""Tony"" is just not right for this kind of movie. The director should have beat him with a chair until he channeled the original rigid, clipped, uptight ""Major Don West"" of the TV series. The other weak spot is the boy who plays Will Robinson. He can act, but he's kind of dull. A person could argue that he's actually more naturalistic and believable as a young boy in space than Billy Mumy, but this is not a movie where a naturalistic performance is needed. The kid just isn't interesting in the part, and since the last third of the movie revolves around the struggle between Dr's. Robinson and Smith for the heart and soul of his character, the whole thing becomes kind of moot. (BTW, a lot of people complained about how annoying Lacey Chabert was in her part, but I blame the screenplay and the director for this - the character was written to be irritating and snarky, and she gave the performance that the role called for. You can point fingers and lay blame at a lot of people for the failure of the movie, but she isn't one of the problems. I actually kind of liked her.) Even where the actors are doing a good job, they are forced them to emote lines that fall flat. Poor Gary Oldman gets a lot of clinkers (""Evil recognizes evil""? Geez, c'mon...!) LeBlanc and Graham are also forced to spout some really wooden and contrived dialog in their, um, ""romantic scenes"" and by-play that they can't pull off; it doesn't help that they have no discernible chemistry. They don't even appear to like each other very much. And Mimi Rogers is given very little to do but bitch at her husband as if she were a soccer mom instead of a PhD carrying astronaut. Even with all these problems, the first part of the movie has its moments; there's some decent action, some impressive special effects, some intrigue and suspense. The climax in the first ""act"" when the ship does an emergency jump into hyperspace to avoid disaster is actually the best part of the movie; there's a memorable 30 second bit of silence and ""freeze frame"" that somehow shows the extreme peril of the situation and the humanity of the characters. But after that, it's all downhill as the plot becomes convoluted and tragic and depressing. I remember that the ending left room for a sequel, but it just didn't seem worth following up. So there you have it: A classic family adventure story dumbed down into campy source material, then bumped back up with major stars and budget, then dumbed back down with misjudged performances and stupid dialog and plotting. There's enough about it to like that I can't give it less than 5 stars, but this is a DVD I wouldn't keep in my collection even if someone gave it to me for free. Too bad.",Lost in Space
42,screenman,Lost Interest,5,14 August 2010,"Well, it's sci-fi modern style, which means lots and lots of action, cut and cut again camera-work and a sound-track with enough thundering, booming base-lines to wake John Bonham.I was quite impressed with the special-effects of the first part showing the lift-off. Then I saw how much of the outer vehicle's carapace was jettisoned into space and reality seemed to blow away with it. Later a big robot went berserk and practically blasted the internals of the vessel to smithereens - but it all turned out to be repairable. It's amazing how much redundancy is built into modern spaceships! Later, this same ship crashes onto a planet, destroying mountain-tops, obliterating rock-formations, etc and suffering no more than scratched paintwork. Yes. Even a Panzer tank would have sustained serious damage under such abusive treatment, let alone the fragile structure of a space vessel. Movie makers need to visit Cape Canaveral once in a while.Otherwise it's classic all-American 'family' hokum. There's the slightly bonkers stowaway as in the much earlier TV series. But that's about it. There's also a ridiculous cartoon creature and plenty of unpleasant robotic spiders.As a movie, it's far too noisy, far too 'busy' with the endless cut-and-shut editing and special-effects, and far to touchy-feely in the sentimental 'family' way.A decent adult cast are wasted on a juvenile script.It's made for kids and they may like it.

44,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Pure 90's cheese, ""Lost in Space"" is an innocent bit of nostalgia that's good fun for children, but likely won't impress adults...",6,16 September 2015,"I must start this review with an important note. I was born in the late 80's and very much grew up a typical 90's/2000's child. I grew up on Sega Genesis and Nintendo 64. I was a die-hard Nickelodeon cartoon fan and spent my weekends watching VHS tapes I rented from Video King. I was blown away the first time I saw a DVD player and still think the biggest crime against humanity was Sony rebooting the ""Spider-Man"" franchise instead of making a fourth film with the original cast.What I'm trying to say is... I was never a huge fan of the original ""Lost in Space"" television series. It was before my time, and despite seeing the odd, random repeat on Nick at Night or TV Land, my knowledge of the series was loose at best. And that's still very much the case to this day, because while I have adored revisiting many classic series of old... ""Lost in Space"" the series never really appealed to me.So I won't be going into this review with any pre-conceived notions of what the film should have been, nor will I draw comparisons and contrasts between this film and the series.1998's ""Lost in Space"", a loose adaptation of the classic Sci-Fi series, is one of those odd little relics of the mid-to-late 90's. Notable for it's use (perhaps over-use) of early-ish CGI generated visuals, quirky storytelling that ranges from fascinating to irritatingly cliché, and a cast of wonderful performers who come across as a bit lost on-screen... this is a strange bit of pop-culture history from a strange era of film.Is it good? No, definitely not.Is it as bad as many make it out to be? Again, definitely not.My 10-year-old self definitely enjoyed the heck out of it when I saw it on the big-screen, and even now looking back, I think it has a great deal of dumb-fun entertainment value. It's a film I think children under the age of 13 could still get a kick out of, as will adults who saw it as children and are revisiting it for nostalgia. But I definitely wouldn't recommend it to most adults who are unfamiliar with it. If you aren't in the exact right mindset, it will likely come across as little more than brainless, dated entertainment.The film of course follows the Robinson family, who are taking part in a daring mission to save humanity in the near future. With the Earth slowly dying due to the effects of pollution, they are set to take off on a multi-year excursion to begin a process to colonize an Earth-Like planet (""Alpha Prime"") and complete a ""hypergate"" that will allow other humans to instantly ""leap"" to Alpha Prime. However, a terrorist group has sabotaged their ship- the Jupiter 2- and the Robinsons become lost in the deep voids of space, along with stowaway Dr. Smith. (Gary Oldman.)The highlights of the film are definitely the performances by Oldman as a slimy stowaway with ties to the terrorists, and a possibly-miscast- but-still-quite-fun Matt LeBlanc as Major Don West, a dashing pilot who becomes the sort-of surrogate action-hero as he helps the Robinsons on the journey. A lot of people have spoken negatively on LeBlanc's performance, and the character does have its flaws, but I think this is more the issue of inconsistent writing than LeBlanc's acting. When he's allowed to shine in key action-sequences, LeBlanc is very likable. And of course Oldman is a joy as the nefarious Smith.The film also has a lot of fun moments, including some great effects and action-beats that are a lot of fun, despite being obviously dated now nearly 20 years later. In particular is a great sequence involving mutant spiders and a close call as the Jupiter 2 must escape the vicinity of a massive exploding spaceship.However, this is definitely an incredibly flawed film, and it comes down to the storyline's growing convolution as the film progresses, and it's sappy character development. While I won't give anything away, Akiva Goldsman's script starts out with a bang and is good, episodic fun for it's first 2 acts, before derailing in the final 30 minutes with twists and turns that come out of the left field entirely and feel contrived and pointless. The squeaky- clean, ""cutesy"" character beats also grow tiresome later in the film, including the almost cringe-worthy relationship between the Robinson's young son and his robot companion. (When the boy tries to make his robotic ""friend"" think with his ""heart"", you'll be rolling your eyes... if you aren't already rolling on the floor with laughter.)There's also a lot of aimless sub-plots and sequences that don't feel like they add up to much. (Don't get me started on ""Blarp"", the random CGI ""monkey"" that the Robinsons adopt as a pet.)That all being said, I can't condemn the film outright, and I will maintain that it has a lot of nostalgia for me. Despite it's silly storytelling, weak third act and dated effects, I maintain this is a halfway-decent example of 90's cheese and ""dumb fun"", and I definitely think kids will enjoy it.I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not good. But it's also not terrible, either.",Lost in Space

46,MartianOctocretr5,Losers in Space,2,21 August 2009,"In the never ending quest to ruin every TV show title ever with a ""remake,"" comes this cosmic space dust, one of the very worst of these TV show assassinations.The original TV show was a campy excursion into outer space. We met hideous bug-eyed alien monsters, goofy plotting villains, weird yet childish story lines, cheaply done special effects, and so on. It was all a lot of silly fun. This movie version misses the whole point.It tries so hard to be a meaningful and deep experience, but flops. There's plenty of irritating political correctness, where the family all hate each other more than the Simpsons do. One woman bashes the men for alpha-male mentality, and she acts the exact same way. The once amusing inept villain Dr. Smith is now transformed into some kind of Michael Myers psychopath. Will is no longer the pleasant child full of wonder that anchored the characters together; he's just some angst-filled clod who tries to build a time machine, another plot device these movie makers churn through a meat grinder. Even the lovable robot from the series is played as an obsolete has-been, a clinking, clanking, clattering collection of caliginous junk.Everything is dark and foreboding. Everybody's evil, and nobody likes each other. If this movie was stealing the Aliens moniker, that might have been OK. But not a kids' sci-fi adventure series. As for the actors; in spite of some big names in the cast, they all stink worse than an Alpha-Centauri outhouse. I was hoping they'd all crash into a black hole or a super nova. Or get phasered by a Kling-On war cruiser.Void of nostalgia for fans of the old show. Nothing of value for any sci-fi fan. Utterly useless.",Lost in Space
47,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A Visually Riveting but Narratively Shallow Guilty Pleasure of mine.,5,4 May 2017,"***Potential Spoilers Ahead*** Lost in Space is the '98 adaptation of the cult-classic show from the 60s. And... yeah: this movie is that. It has the name but the style is NOTHING like that of the show upon which it's based. The set design is more high-tech than the 60s low-tech feeling the original series gave us. I personally think the former is the more appealing design, because it actually feels like a legit scifi setting.Before Star Trek got the reboot treatment in 2009, there was this incarnation of Lost in Space in 1998. To be fair, Lost in Space isn't bad, but the visuals are stronger than the story it's telling. It's just a family getting lost not just in space, but the script as well. There's time travel, there's a future version of one of the characters... and the ending is a goddamn cliffhanger for a sequel that never happened! I loved this movie as a kid and part of me still loves it. But I know it's a sub-par space opera movie compared to all the other ones I've seen throughout the years. It ain't Star Wars, it ain't Star Trek, it ain't Interstellar or Serenity. Hell it ain't even Guardians of the Galaxy; but THIS film does have the original voice of Robot. That's a plus. The actor's voice is fantastic I reckon.Lost in Space; a film lost in itself and a franchise that never was. And a guilty pleasure.",Lost in Space
48,Op_Prime,Thumbs up!,8,14 August 1999,"This movie was very, very good. The special effects are well done. Matt LeBlanc (Major West) and William Hurt (Prof. Robinson) play their characters very well. The others do an okay job as well. The plot is kind of strange but this is based on the Lost In Space tv show. What really appeals to me with this movie is that it is darker and has more conflict than the original tv show. In the tv show, the characters all seemed to get along, except for Dr. Smith. In the movie, they act like the normal family, except for being stranded in space. The movie also has great sequel potential thanks to the ending. I give it a 8/10.",Lost in Space
49,mentalcritic,"Warning, Will Robinson! You're in a sucky film!",2,13 September 2006,"For those who have not heard the concept, let me tell you a bit about No Man's Land. In the combat situations of World War I, it referred to the long stretch of land between the trenches. This was due to the fact that anyone who set foot on it was killed. In tennis, it refers to the parts of the court between the outer edge where the players begin and a certain distance from the net. This is mostly because it is difficult, if not impossible, to intercept a volley when standing in this area. In film criticism, No Man's Land refers to the kind of film that is too bad to be really enthralling, but is not bad enough to be particularly amusing. Classic examples of this phenomenon include Lethal Weapon 4, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and Scream 3. Lost In Space as a television show was never that enthralling, being more a case of Americans trying too hard to recreate Doctor Who. As a film, Lost In Space does not seem to have any idea what it is trying to be, and ends up as more of a case of being nothing to anyone.The right elements were in place where casting was concerned. Gary Oldman and William Hurt are great actors who were and still are at the top of their game. Stephen Hopkins has a mixed resumé, and I will not get into the merits of his prior films, but I do believe the defense I anticipate him using. Put simply, the best actors and director in the world cannot overcome a bad script, or bad planning. Look at RoboCop before Hollow Man, then try to tell me otherwise. And if there is one thing that Lost In Space has in abundance, it is a bad script. Akiva Goldsman's other credits include such fare as I, Robot (or Will Smith Taking A Dump On Isaac Asimov's Grave as it should be called), Batman & Robin, and Batman Forever. If I need to say more about who is to blame for this tax write-off, then you clearly have not seen enough films. And make no mistake. The audience whose nostalgia they were counting on to make money took one look, laughed, and promptly saw something else.If there is any bad acting in Lost In Space, it is mainly on Matt LeBlanc's shoulders. Famous at the time for playing a moronic TV actor in a moronic sitcom, he portrays his military officer character exactly as his moronic TV actor character would portray him. So if you are looking for proof that the cast of Friends is not entirely made up of talentless hacks, then look elsewhere. Scenes between LeBlanc and Oldman are especially amusing. Oldman, well, one of his earliest roles was portraying one of punk rock's most pathetically talentless men, a role he portrayed so well it was like looking at a ghost. Some people who have never seen him in that role would have no idea from watching him in the role of Dr. Smith, and if what I have just said is a surprise to you, then you are proving my point. Put simply, the acting is either cancelled out by the bad script, or it is just plain bad.Lost In Space did get a second lease on life being used in hi-fi stores to demonstrate expensive gear. At the time, the ability to play back home video with six channels of audio was almost the exclusive domain of the rich, and there was no shortage of individuals who would watch a film for its soundtrack rather than the film itself. And it is just as well, because the cacophony of noise that permeates the majority of Lost In Space is enough to double one's vision. As unimpressed as I was with the TV series, it is remarkable that they were able to create a weekly drama with clever conflicts and strange settings on an episodic budget that could not buy one a house these days. The film cost enough money to have built the Jupiter set, film six hundred and twelve episodes of the TV series, and still have change left over. Yet what little there seemed to be in said TV series, in terms of a soul or an intellect, is utterly absent from the film. People complain about better special effects translating into poor plots, but never have I seen a better example.The Blarp, as it is called in the credits, is not the worst example of a CGI character being used where a human or puppet would achieve better results, but it is certainly not a good one. One cannot help but think that George Lucas must have been watching. And the film really does try to be everything to everyone. To a child audience, it tries to present a cute monster or a child cast that the children could relate to. It fails there. When attempting to present enough explosions and moments of action to the adult audience, it fails. And in disconnecting most of its moorings from the TV series, it disconnects itself from most of the point it had in existing. To call this even a mediocre space travel film is flattery. While a total disrespect to the laws of science is one thing, providing no explanation for the liberties taken with said laws is another altogether. I have heard it suggested that New Line Cinema made Lost In Space was intentionally made to be as bad as possible as if it were all one big joke. Having seen the film, I can only agree.Hence, I gave Lost In Space a two out of ten. Not every film can be The Godfather, but between having garbage like this coming out every week and having a few good films per year, I definitely favour the latter. Down with mass-production, and down with Lost In Space.",Lost in Space
50,Victor Field,WHY?!?!,1,21 September 2002,"This is a classic example of how NOT to bring a TV show to the big screen; the TV show may have been idiotic (in the latter seasons, anyway), but at least it could be fun and get some kind of emotional feedback. But what did New Line Cinema get when they bought the entire intellectual (ha!) property from Twentieth Century Fox?They got the family from the original ""Lost in Space"" glummed-down for their cinematic incarnation (in a misguided attempt by writer Akiva Goldsman to make the Robinsons seem more realistic - whatever happened to happy families?). But that's only the start of this boring space odyssey's faults: the acting's weak; the writing and directing (Stephen Hopkins, that's you) are unforgivably slack; the plot just drags on and on until the movie just seems to stop instead of ending properly; the Bloop is the worst Jim Henson's Creature Shop creation EVER, no arguments; the special effects are unimpressive on a scale unrivalled until ""Dinotopia""; Lacey Chabert is supremely irritating as Penny; the techno music we're forced to endure over the endless end credits is appalling...OK, there are some good bits about the movie. I will now list them.1. Heather Graham as Judy Robinson.2. The welcome return of the voice of Dick Tufeld (the only cast member apart from Miss Graham who can be bothered to act).3. The bit where everyone says ""Goodnight"" over a shot of the spaceship at rest in a takeoff of ""The Waltons"" (capped by Matt LeBlanc's otherwise useless Major West saying ""You have got to be kidding"").4. LeBlanc walloping Gary Oldman after the latter's totally inexplicable impression of Private Pike from ""Dad's Army"" (""We're doomed! We're doomed!"").5. Bruce Broughton's music (a pox on the artists whose ""music"" is excerpted at the end).6. It ends.",Lost in Space
51,Beta_Gallinger,"A tedious sci-fi flick with nice special effects, but not much else",5,6 April 2008,"I have never seen any episodes of the 1960s TV series, ""Lost in Space"", but first saw this movie based on the series on TV a couple years ago, and wasn't impressed. I later realized I could barely remember it, so I've watched it again, and hopefully for the last time, since it certainly didn't improve much, if at all, with another viewing. Like 1994's ""The Flintstones"", this is a movie from the '90s based on a TV show from the '60s. Unfortunately, another thing the two films have in common is they're not very good, so it's no surprise that they seem to have disappointed fans of the successful shows. I guess the same can be said about ""Wild Wild West"".It is the year 2058, and the Earth is running out of resources. In twenty years time, humans will no longer be able to survive on the planet! The only other known planet that is inhabitable to humans is Alpha Prime, and it will take ten years to get there from Earth! So, Professor John Robinson and his wife, Dr. Maureen Robinson, set out for this planet, along with their daughters, Dr. Judy and Penny, and son Will, and they are to remain in suspended animation for the long trip. However, also aboard the ship is the evil Dr. Smith, who soon sabotages the mission! The Robinsons soon find themselves awake, stuck with Smith, and after having to use the Hyper-Drive in order to survive, all the people aboard find themselves lost in an unknown part of the galaxy!The main merit of this movie adaptation of the TV series is the special effects. Thumbs up on those. However, thumbs down on pretty much everything else! Yes, there is a fair amount of action, but it's not very well-crafted, and usually failed to grab me. I can think of at least one action scene that's too long, which is the one where they battle the silicon spiders on the ship. The film certainly had trouble holding my attention at times, including the silicon spider scene, where my mind drifted off a bit, until it came back and I realized the battle was still happening! Not a lot of excitement. I also saw some attempts at humour, but didn't find them funny at all, and I think I've already forgotten most of them. The closest it gets to funny is when Will says ""Oh, s&#@,"" and Dr. Smith says ""A boy of your intelligence should never swear,"" but then sees what made Will say it and says the same thing. Sadly, even this joke misses the mark slightly. The film doesn't have the greatest script, and some parts are pretty cheesy, such as Maj. Don West trying to show his love for Dr. Judy Robinson in a pathetic way. Also, the acting is nothing to rave about, and some cast performances may stand out as bad, such as Heather Graham as Dr. Judy Robinson. I have only seen Graham in one other film, ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"", but after seeing her in two films and hearing criticism of her acting in general from others, I'm convinced she cannot act.With all its problems, ""Lost in Space"" isn't too entertaining for the most part. Special effects are obviously not enough to make up for this. Towards the end, it does get somewhat suspenseful and maybe a bit touching, and if it didn't, I would contemplate giving this movie less than a 5/10. However, overall, it's just a dull sci-fi flick, and to make it worse, it's a dull flick that keeps going for over two hours! This adaptation of the ""Lost in Space"" show is probably a bit better than the movie adaptation of the ""Wild Wild West"" show, which came the following year, but that's not saying much. I would also say this film is probably just slightly inferior to the ""Flintstones"" movie. At least that film has some notably likable characters. In conclusion, there's probably no shame at all in skipping this 1998 movie, whether you're familiar with the original TV series or not.",Lost in Space
52,PartialMovieViewer,Enjoyable Romp,8,13 February 2014,"If ever there was a movie in need of a sequel it had to have been this one. I was deeply saddened not to see a trailer for ""Lost in Space II"". Come on, this entire Robinson family (and Robot) are still up theresomewhere. Just wandering around spaceand no one cares? Really? Well I care. Harrumph. All kidding aside, I really enjoyed this fun little romp (and I do own a copy). Normally I hate movie redoes of TV shows, especially good TV shows. But this movie's silver screen predecessor sucked. Yes, it was terrible, or should I say awful? Or maybe even – really, really bad? I am not saying 'Lost in Space' wasn't fun to watch, but it was difficult to seriously take any of those wacky Ed Wood reject monsters who weekly harassed the Robinsons. But every Wednesday I watched Will and Penny and Judy and Robot – of course, hoping to see how they would be getting back home. Can you say gullible? Hell, I wasn't the only one watching, everyone did. This was as staple a TV diet as, 'Gilligan's Island.' Back in those days, getting lost must have been some kind of trend I guess. Even though this movie was a bit of a remake, it did not rely solely on special effects and CGI. This move actually had a pretty good script and a superior cast. William Hurt is the consummate drab Dr. Robinson; Mimi Rogers would make June Lockhart proud, and Judy and Will each did superb jobs. The scene stealers had to have been Gary Oldeman (Dr. Smith) and Robot. You are probably thinking I left the best out – oh but I did not. Lacey Chabert was 'The Penny.' Her performance was so captivating I change the 'REWIND' button on my DVD to 'The Lacey/Penny' button. She is the 'Queen of Quirkiness.' Every scene she was in, I watched her like a hawk. She was going to do something or say something that would steal that scene. Was this the best movie about a family getting lost in space, made in the 90's? Wellyes it is. This is a must see for some and a must miss for otherskind of like every movie out there.",Lost in Space

54,spookyrat1,Space Family Robinson!,7,22 April 2019,"I'm a little surprised this wasn't more successful than it was. I think it was a timely reboot, which had a good cast and a generous budget and was clearly designed to be the start-up for a series of sequels, which just never eventuated, as the film would have barely made a profit, if any.Lost in Space was aimed at the family market, but wisely didn't fall into the trap, the TV series eventually did, by focusing 90% of the stories on Will, a comical, rather than villainous, Dr Smith and the robot. Onscreen time is pretty much evenly distributed amongst the characters, with Lacey Chabert's Penny, probably copping the least time and the least interesting storyline. I do think we could have done without the stereotypical family dysfunctions sub-plot too. It really doesn't make sense that the United Global Space Force (UGSF) would send up a family who couldn't be relied upon to work together harmoniously. I also would have personally liked to have seen more of Maureen, but the Matt LeBlanc/Heather Graham pairing was terrific, with the romantic chemistry between Don and a very smart, feisty Judy being a highlight of the film.I'm always one for a good time travel story and personally didn't mind the one presented here. At the same time however, I think this may have been a reason the film wasn't a huge success. It just does seem incredibly unlikely that after being thrown off course, in the vastness of space the Jupiter 2 would encounter a vessel from Earth from a later time and then afterwards a couple of older members of their crew. Convenient yes, readily believable? Probably not. Still the screen writer was the very experienced and highly regarded Akiva Goldman, so go figure.However I liked the special effects, especially those relating to the Jupiter 2 and the robot. They paid homages to the originals, whilst significantly updating them. Australian director Stephen Hopkins whose work on this project was pretty thorough in my estimations, has never had a really big hit. I'd liked to have seen him enjoy bigger audiences for Lost in Space, because I would have loved seeing into what uncharted territories a follow-up tale might have taken us.",Lost in Space

It arose from Hell and pushed TITANIC into second place at the box office.If this film rocked your boat, I would also suggest THE TIME MACHINE with Guy Pearce. Just, never look to the horrid, old TV series for redemption. The film is slow at developing itself, which, in many ways is good. It helps us understand the characters. The cast includes many famous stars such as William Hurt, Gary Oldman, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert, Jack Johnson and a few more. The film gets intense about half-way through.

Lost In Space had very professional directing and a good story. I believe the story could have been better thought out because it almost lost me in confusion for a few minutes. The special effects were dazzling. The cast was exceptional, although I'm getting bored with Gary Oldman's portrayals of evil men. The Dr. Smith character was a walk in the park for Oldman. I just want to say that William Hurt is one of the most under-rated actors around. He holds this film together. If I have one complaint about the film at all, it is the length.

There's a few things here and there that I could have done without (Blarp, the little alien monkey thing), but for the most part I absolutely loved this film.  The special effects alone were worth the film.  I couldn't believe the detail in some of the scenes in the film (for example the Jupiter Launch...JUST FANTASTIC!!!)Also, this film is filled with cool science fiction ideas.  I LOVE the idea of a ""Hyper-gate"", such a fun idea.  Also, who doesn't like time travel? Time travel is always fun!  Then there's these interesting alien spider things, VERY COOL!  I thought this film was filled with so much fun and interesting things and being so, made it great!As far as the story goes, I thought it was excellent and very well thought out.  Although, I'm sure if you think about the time-travel aspect enough, you'll come up with some very interesting paradoxes in the film, but that's pretty much inevitable with a time-travel film.  I must admit, that I know absolutely nothing about the original television show.

62,chrisbrown6453,"A longer, much deserved review.",9,17 June 2002,"This is my second review of this movie; I felt that it deserved another one due to the fact that I just wrote a little something fast before thinking it out.  I owe it to my readers to thoroughly process films before writing reviews, which is why I haven't posted lately.Now this was one hell of a movie. I can't figure out why so many people didn't like it.  I mean it have a 4.7 overall rating at this website.?.
First of all, I'm too young to remember the TV series, so I can't compare this movie to that, but regardless, this was one of the better sci-fi films I've seen. Lost In Space takes place in the year 2058. All of Earth's natural resources are dwindling, and within the next twenty years, no life will be able to survive. So the people in charge of such things have been searching the universe for water and things humans need to survive, and they find some on a distant planet, somewhere else in the universe. So Dr. Robinson (William Hurt) takes his family on the ship Jupiter 2, to help colonize the planet, so that future generations may survive. The ship is piloted by Major John West (Matt LeBlanc), and is sabotaged by Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman). Well, as the title suggests, they get lost somewhere in space, and can't figure out a way to get back home. But strange things happen. They run across a ship, built by their federation, but unlike any ship they've seen before. Then these strange spiders attack them. And all hell breaks loose. The plot isn't all that important really, especially when you (and they) come to a certain realization about half way through the film. I won't give it all away, but it's another one of those things where if you think about it too hard, it won't make sense.But as far as the special effects go, they were pretty amazing. Things that you know are blue (or green) screened look more and more realistic. The look of the movie, in the costumes and the sets, are pretty remarkable. The most remarkable aspect of this film was the sound, it was incredible. Maybe it's my home theater system, but I don't remember a movie's special effects sounding so good before. Matt LeBlanc breaks away from his Friends character, and does a great job. I was impressed, especially since his last choice of movies was with an ape. The rest of the cast did a good job, although I did get tired of Dr. Smith's continual snide remarks. And I didn't understand his character all that much after he sabotaged the mission. I mean, if the only way to get back to civilization depended on these people, why would you continue to try and hurt them? He couldn't make it back on his own, yet he always tried to hurt them. And what was up with the little creature they picked up along the way? Does anyone else think that he was there, just so they had some stuffed animal they could sell to little kids?Overall, I did enjoy the movie. The first sixty to ninety minutes very exciting, and action packed. When they landed on the strange planet, things started to bog down, as they tried to give you more of a story. But there was a big blow up ending, and as always, they leave room for a sequel. I'd say this was definitely a good movie to see in the theaters. Those of you who missed it will just have to wait for the re-release.",Lost in Space
63,majikstl,Wasted space ...,3,19 October 2005,"LOST IN SPACE is, of course, the big screen treatment of the campy, cheesy, tacky pseudo-classic TV show from the 60s; but watching this stiff, humorless would-be epic, one is apt to get the distinct feeling that it is really part of a big screen adaptation of the 90s hit ""Friends."" One reason is obvious, a lead character is played by ""Friends"" star Matt LeBlanc. But more than his presence, it is LeBlanc's performance that brings up memories of his Joey Tribianni character, you know, the dull-witted wannabe actor. Repeatedly, LeBlanc seems to be reprising his role of soap character, Dr. Drake Remorey, right down to his confused smell-the-fart pauses and deadpan dramatic delivery. One cannot help but to expect the film to cut away to shots of his Central Perk pals sitting around Monica's Manhattan apartment staring in bemused disbelief at their TV as Joey makes his latest disastrous attempt at establishing an acting career.Unfortunately, while LeBlanc was very funny playing a bad actor on TV, here he seems to be fulfilling the role in real life. He, like the film, inspires amusement, but for all the wrong reasons.But picking on LeBlanc is not really fair, because he is hardly the weakest element of this woefully uninspired and ill-conceived effort. Indeed, he is no worse than the always bland and whiny William Hurt, or the usually hammy Gary Oldman, who, strangely, has opted to underplay in a part that begs for flamboyant overacting, that of the nefarious villain, Dr. Smith.The TV series, a sci-fi revamp of ""The Swiss Family Robinson,"" probably began with serious intentions, not unlike the movie, but once it caught on with kids, it quickly morphed into an elaborate children's show, replete with wildly silly plots and the cheesiest sets and special effects this side of Saturday morning kidvid. The show was awful, but in an endearingly likable way, like ""Batman."" It fed on its own inanity and became a self-parody.The only possible reason to regurgitate the series as a feature film is to try to capture that giddy sense of childish silliness. Instead, for reasons that defy logic, the film version is dark and self-important, utterly devoid of either humor or even humanity. The film can't even generate a sense of family. The Robinson clan -- mom, dad, two teenage girls and a little boy -- all seem to be coworkers rather than family members; indeed, the film makes it clear that all are scientific geniuses and therefore are more important as crewmembers than as family members. All the relationships in the film seem as cold and impersonal as the ugly uninviting sets. Its odd ""Father Knows Best"" moments have the warmth of a computer program. The film's ultimate message seems to be to confirm the enduring strength of the family unit, but it does a poor job of making a convincing argument. And when the film abandons all common sense for a ludicrous, time-twisting, special effects-laden climax, it's hard to care since the characters have inspired such little sympathy.I suppose the logic is that the film has to appeal to a new generation, that the people who have fond memories of the camp TV show are too old and not demographically desirable as contemporary ticket buyers. I can understand that, but that raises the question about why the film exists at all. It would seem that if there is a need for a Space Family Robinson aimed at a family market, then it would logically be patterned after STAR WARS, not ""Lost in Space""; a story designed for adventure and colorful characters, not solemn platitudes. Yet, a hokey-jokey version of the series could have worked, as witnessed by the success of GALAXY QUEST.Meanwhile, LeBlanc, like the rest of the cast, put this flop behind him. He returned to TV to spin off ""Friends"" with the sitcom ""Joey,"" where his Tribianni character becomes a successful movie star. Talk about your science fiction.",Lost in Space

Gary Oldman is fantastically evil, and Matt LeBlanc is charismatic, but they're the lone bright spots in the cast, as the Robinson family is just bland, bland, bland.

Hooray for June Lockhart, who still has one of the most beautiful faces ever filmed, for her good humored appearance.  Mark Goddard had a good role - and was very good.  Nice touch to have him appoint Matt Le Blanc as the new pilot.  I would have liked to have seen more of Angela Cartwright and Marta Kristen, who only had one line each (as reporters), but they both looked smashing.  And thank you for giving the robot's voice his old role back!But where on earth (excuse the pun!) were Jonathan Harris and Bill Mummy???!!!  This is where the golden opportunities were missed, because there seemed to be two characters tailor made for the two actors.  The time travelling Robinsons meet the future adult Will Robinson in one scene - how poignant if this had been Bill Mummy!  And the head of the rebels who assigns Dr. Smith to destroy the Jupiter 2, and then attempts to kill him, would have been a perfect role for Jonathan Harris (who is now 86!).

Penny was great as the sexy jail bait (could not do that in the 60's!).  Judy played the uptight, but hot, Judy to Major West's over active libido.  Dr. Robinson was great as the intellectual/scientist/explorer/family man (not to tough, not too sensitive), and Will played the pre-requisite boy/genius who was just enough an innocent and smart.The robot looked cool, but just did not have Robby's (the original robot from the series) charisma.Dr. Smith readily captured the ""original"" from the series and not the bumbling fool that he morphed into later.As to the plot, we've pretty much seen it all before, but the acting is what really carries this film.",Lost in Space

Very hard to enjoy a film when it does that.Also, good luck trying to hear what Smith's boss on the hologram said (also do we need to see a big nauseating close up on his face?) and Spider Smith's back story when we have loud stomping noises from his feet. The film was written by Akiva Goldsman, who also wrote Batman and Robin. Oh dear. The characters were boring. Matt LeBlanc looks bored as Don and if you watch his interview on the DVD, he looks like he's going to fall asleep. William Hurt's Professor John was bland, Will was just wooden and the whole ""my dad never listens to me"" thing has been done to death and is very clichéd.Heather Graham has nothing to do except be the love interest, nothing more. Penny was annoying, Mimi Rogers brought nothing to the table and Gary Oldman is there to pay his bills. Also the actors look nothing like each other if they're playing a family.The CGI is awful. Nothing looks real. Even for a 1998 film. This film came out a year after Men In Black, The Fifth Element and Titanic and they couldn't do any better. Kind of what happens when you have a British visual effects house.The scene where Jupiter 2 is near the sun, inside the ship is all bright and we can't see what the hell is going on.

Then they totally miscast Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith. Don't get me wrong, Gary Oldman is a great actor, and he was really good at being a sleazy, conniving and utterly evil bad guy. The problem is that the Dr. Smith in the TV series was a cowardly weasel, but not really evil, just self centered, and self-serving.

It was an averagely entertaining movie, good idea for a remake film, but it kind of collapsed into itself. They had to many little story arcs that was never finished or continued. Yet some of them suddenly popped up at the end of the film and created very interesting and unpredictable events. And this I think saved the movie, it had a good closure on it's early main theme (if you have seen the movie you know what I'm talking about).Basically the movie is about a family (the Robinsons) that is sent on a mission to create a ""beacon"" of sorts on another life supporting planet (it far away but still the closest on to earth) so that earth can use its hyperdrive travelling to save earths resources. The problem is hyperdrive is completely random unless someone is sending a signal from the final destination. So the family and they're pilot is send on a ten year sleep journey. Only problem is a saboteur cases the ship to shift its trajectory towards the sun, and they're only escape is to use the hyperdrive, which of course sends them to a random place in the galaxy.The cast was OK.

Most remembered by me as the film that took TITANIC off it's box office throne, I was curious to see what it was about that film that managed to draw in such talented performers as William Hurt and Gary Oldman. After seeing the film, I know the answer... a paycheck.This tells the story of the Robinsons, a family about to go out on the most far reaching space expedition ever in order to find another liveable planet for earth's citizens. The reason for doing so is that Earth's supplies are running out and their is an evil alien race looking to destroy earth. However, on the night before the family sets off on their mission, an evil ally of the alien race, Dr. Smith (played by Gary Oldman) sneaks on board and sabotages the mission.After the spaceship is destroyed and all plans are ruined... we find that Dr. Smith has been trapped on board as well. Now, the family is LOST IN SPACE without any contact with Earth or any idea of what Galaxy they have found themselves in.Honestly, the film starts out somewhat promising. For the first few sequences leading up to the actual take off of the space craft, the film embraces it's cheesiness. As the family is preparing for their voyage, the film has a sense of humor that makes the cheesiness seem like it's on purpose, in a ""camp"" style. But then, after the take off, and as their adventures in space become more ""intenst"" the cheesiness loses it's style... and it no longer comes across as a director's choice. The cheese becomes an unavoidable element of the movie.Little by little the film tries to incorporate more and more special effects and thrills... but as it does it steps further and further into ""bad movie"" territory. Instead of coloring the action sequences with a campy style that could have really improved the film, the director and cast seems to be oblivious to how hambone this all is. Gary Oldman, who can often bring a colorful and eccentric performance to lesser films is just boring here... William Hurt brings nothing to the table... Mimi Rogers flat out sucks... Matt LeBlanc is stiff as a board... and none of the Robinson children can boast anything more than juvenile performances.In the end, the plot becomes more confusing then is worth wasting your time to figure out. Genuine affection for the characters is never created by the filmmaker, nor is a moment of genuine thrills and tension. Honestly, the first half hour or so is much better then the rest of the film b/c of it's campy lighthearted style... unfortunately this film seemed to think it had a right to take itself seriously for it's final 2/3.

What we end up with is a multitude of ""mini-episodes"" all put into the plot blender and set on high. The result is a mixture of putrid tripe so rancid you don't even want to try and drink it. For example, the bit with the space-spiders, was so tacked on you almost start to cringe when they come on. Crash landing on the frozen world was a waste of time and flat out dull. But worst of all was the whole ""Time vortex"" with the adult Will and mutated Dr. Smith. This was such a half baked concept and could have worked so much better had they given it more time and thought. Yet here its thrown in with sheer desperation. In Conclusion: If your a fan of ""Lost in Space"" the series, go watch those episodes. If you not, this movie isn't going to change you mind.",Lost in Space
93,emdoub,A tribute to the 1960's television show,7,16 May 2005,"Much of this movie is a retelling of the original television pilot, with better script, characterization, and effects.Before I saw the movie, I KNEW that nobody else could play the Dr. Smith role with any credibility - Gary Oldman proved me wrong. He improves upon the role while maintaining the character's mannerisms far better than I'd expected.Lacey Chabert brings life and realism to the role of Penny, Matt LeBlanc is a fine Major West, and the rest of the cast does well in recreating or improving on their roles.The spaceship, when outfitted with the launch boosters, bears a remarkable resemblance to the ship in the original series. While the robot is very different, you can see the bubble of the top of the original robot as they gather pieces of the disassembled robot. Several of the actors from the original series show up in small parts in the movie, but you'll have to watch for Marta Kristen (the original Judy) and Angela Cartwright (the original Penny) - they've got small roles as reporters. June Lockheart (the original Maureen) is much easier to spot as the principal of young Will's school. There are other nods toward the original series, but I won't give them all away.The second part of the movie, which is a departure from anything shown in the series, has gaping flaws in the science - but so did the original series. For example, if Will escapes the planet with his family, then the older Will cannot be there with the graves of the rest of the family - but without them, escape will not be possible. The focus on the relationship between father and son is something that simply would not have played to 1960s audiences.All in all, a pretty fun movie that more than lived up to expectations.",Lost in Space
94,brower8,"Danger, Will Robinson! Atrocious Movie!",3,26 July 2003,"Science fiction is good only to the extent that it causes one to suspend disbelief in such plot elements as time travel, alternate histories, predictions of the future, and what Robert Heinlein called ""doubletalk drives"".  Solid plot and development of characters must be particularly good to distract from such things. Those, regrettably, are absent here.
Lost in Space has nice set design, except that it is grossly obsolete -- it's about the same level of sophistication as in the Star Trek TV series -- lots of flashing lights typical of circa-1965 computers. Can anyone say ""PCs""? One can excuse the original Star Trek or Lost In Space series on television -- but not the movie in question.  Plausibility? Would anyone in good conscience send a family into space? Sure, I say this after the Columbia disaster, but what administrators would have no ethical qualms about doing so? Sure, that was a problem with the TV series, but at least one didn't need to pay for a movie ticket or buy a DVD.In view of Star Wars, wouldn't we expect to see more humanity in the robot? Wouldn't the robot have some sort of built-in security  system to prevent the disruption of the mission at the start of the movie?This movie is dreck -- an attempt to have a disaster movie with 'cute' elements (especially the alien life form that is instantly recognized as cuddly and safe. Heck, if you want a cuddly, clever creature and you have no qualms about bringing children along, then you might as well bring along the family dog). 2 of 10 -- a waste of time and money.

Mind you blame can't be put on them as their roles are only as good as the scripts put before them so you know who to blame for that as well...I bought the film last year on DVD only out of nostalgia, but when I did see it on the big screen it was a fairly full cinema, mostly people I think who grew up with the TV show.Overall this gets a 3/10 for me.Let's see how the made for TV movie works out when and if it is ever released......",Lost in Space
96,Thorsten_B,Well... the Music is the best Part of it,2,29 May 2004,"Imagine slices of 'Star Wars', 'Battlestar Galactica', 'Event Horizon' mixed with a story that captures good old-fashioned family values out of the perspective of, say, a 12-year-old: This is what you get when watching 'Lost in Space'. I don't know the series, so I can only comment on the movie whose script seemingly tries to include all clichés that could probably be brought into context. Of course, with these type of films one shouldn't bother about everything that is unlogical  there are simply too many aspects of that available. Nor should one watch it with the expectation to see anything new or unpredictable. Apart from Gary Oldman, who is given a good chance to portray what he portrays best  the evil and yet interesting cynical villain , and who is even allowed to star in a double role, the actors seem uninterested and out of focus. Quo vadis, William Hurt? After a great time in the 80s, Hurt seems to need money  lots of it, and quick. No scripts are turned downed, it seems, and be they as intolerable as this one (ok, I exclude 'Dark City' from that). No offense though  if I were an actor, I wouldn't mind participating in here either, and if it only were for Heather Graham. Special effects weren't so bad either. Bad it's almost laughable to see how strongly the producers try to keep a door open for a sequel that will never be produced. But one thing deserves honorable mention: Bruce Broughtons score is as brilliant as anything he ever wrote.",Lost in Space
97,underfire35,"Not Bad, Per Say, But Not Good...",5,9 March 2004,"First off, I am not prone to weepy eyed nostalgia about the T.V. shows I used to watch when I was young and vital, now that I am an aging failure. It does not warm my heart to see past stars recycled into a film remake like LOST IN SPACE, just to lend the production a facade of credibility.  Nor do I support pop culture in any way.  The unfertile soil of Hollywood loves this kind of film, because it has a built in fan base (although seemingly not large enough to prevent LOST IN SPACE from being a flop).  The film version of the Irwin Allen's campy television is slick and good looking, but hollow and pointless.The first half hour of LOST IN SPACE is awful, really bad.  I almost turned it off, but I was watching it because of Gary Oldman, so I decided to stick it out.  If you can get through the first quarter it does get better.  The frantic lameness evens out, focusing more on the characters once the Robinson's become ""lost in space"".  The performances are good on average (except for the child actors, who are quite irritating).  William Hurt, who tries his best, seems somewhat out of place in a fully costumed kitsch space drama.  Mimi Rodgers is wasted, and Heather Graham is given little to do. I wonder why Matt LeBlanc's film career didn't take off ""like a rocket"" after LOST IN SPACE...The only actor that leaves any kind of impression after the embarrassing end credits roll, is Gary Oldman.  Once again the bright spot in a otherwise dreary film.  It is not his best performance, mostly due to the dialogue that he is given (supplied by Akiva Goldsman).  He makes the most of it however, bringing the flat character of Dr. Zachary Smith to life. Creating yet another unique accent, he overshadows the rest of the cast by far.Okay, so I said LOST IN SPACE was not that bad.  The film kind of grows on you with its' good natured emptiness.  There are some decent set pieces, including the creation of Dr. Smith's altered state near the end.  Most of the CGI effects were ambitious for the time, and the production design is impressive.  The score by Bruce Broughton (who came in after Jerry Goldsmith dropped out) is thrilling, but buried under the sound effects.  The spider chase creates mild tension and predates MINORITY REPORT by several years, although RUNAWAY predates...nevermind.  When all is said LOST IN SPACE would appear to be too confusing and creepy to appeal to children, but fans of the series will probably like it I guess, I'm not sure.  Worth it for Oldman and fans of the T.V. show...catch it on cable though.  5/10.",Lost in Space

Most of the acting is wooden and overtaken by the decors and special effects.It has a good basic plot, based on the old story of the marooned 19th century Swiss family Robinson, but now set ofcourse in space.
It all holds somehow together until about 3/4th of the movie. Then, as in most recent US blockbusters, the screenwriters seem to get so confused they completely ruin the ending. I won't go into details but 'silly', 'over the top' and 'needlessly complicated' come to mind.But somehow, until the end bit anyway, I wasn't bored with the story.Actors are typical cliché as Hurt, who is his usual self, always looking like he is about to fall asleep. Leblanc tries his best at being macho but he becomes a parody. Only Oldman as the cynical villain, and ofcourse cool Lacy Chabert , as the cutesy 'bet I'm smarter-than-you' youngest daughter, stand out.Al in all, not such a bad effort, if they only hadn't bungled up that ending.",Lost in Space

A cast of A players (on their way to being spit out by fickle Hollywood), including William Hurt (at the time struggling with bad press from his personal life), Mimi Rogers (there was that religious movie), Heather Graham (appearing soon and often in any TV sitcom near you), Gary Oldman (on his way to playing Commissioner Gordon) and ""Friends"" friend Matt LeBlanc (who surprisingly holds his own here), take an otherwise dull script and hackneyed premise (think 'Swiss Family Robinson') and turn it into fun if light popcorn fare. Billy Mumy (the original Will) has a nice supporting role. The cool techno reprise of the original catchy TV theme at the end titles is fun.

William Hurt gave a serious tone, as he said to his wife ""Smith can still hurt us"".So, do we put Dr Smith in a freezing tube for the rest of the voyage? The young Will Robinson was good, as he bantered with the Robot. Which, was a well designed robot. To bad a sequel wasn't made, I'm sure it would have been better.

104,rorymacveigh,An Contradictory Mess,3,15 August 2012,"It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc.Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...",Lost in Space

The film is Hollywood mid-management filmmaking at its most slapdash and least thoughtful. The great crime of the fact of the movie's awfulness is that it sullies the records of two very good actors, William Hurt (Robinson pere, leader of the family expedition to space) and Gary Oldman (sensibly cast in his typical psychological and elegant baddie role, but rather unsensibly turned into a junk-CGI arachnid toward the film's end). On a pure sci-fi interest level, this version of Lost in Space is passable, just. The ships and their lasers are pedestrian but cool enough, the graphics portraying time travel and folds in space are serviceable, the deep space spiders look, well, like deep space spiders. You would think that with colorable sci-fi dressing and Hurt and Oldman, any script and ensemble could soldier through and deliver a worthwhile two hours. This film proves that assumption very, very wrong. Doubtless Hurt, Oldman, and even Matt LeBlanc, who likely had other options during his post-Friends victory lap period, were assured of a can't miss hit when they signed up.

I admire word economy and impact, and this 1999 review had both. I just finished watching the movie for the 6th time, on the original videocassette I bought a long time ago. IT WAS AND IS OUTSTANDING. I have many fond childhood memories of the original series, which of course fell into sappy mediocrity even before the first season ended. The movie, happily, pays an homage to the situation and some of the plot silliness of the original show, without laying it on too thick. As others have mentioned, the cameos by Goddard, Kristen, Cartwright and Lockhart were beautifully done as well. My single complaint, which I choose to ignore in my watchings, is the dully over-emphasized point that (let's get this right) ""a dad should spend time with his son."" OK. I. Get.

You have to bear in mind that the movie is based on a series that had a continuous storyline.  The movie doesn't have a strong conclusion, moreso an opening to further stories.I am not sure if a sequel will come for this movie (will be based on box office success and not ratings no doubt ( look at the Batman ratings to figure that out).The movie has a star studded cast.  I was particularly impressed with Gary Oldman who is very unlikable as Dr Zachary Smith.  Mat Le Blanc also plays Major West effectivley as the cocky military pilot.  The blossoming romance with the gorgeous Heather Graham provides some of the comic element of the movie.William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Lacey Chabert and Jack Johnson play the remainder of the Roninson Clan.What I am critical about in this movie is that a lot of the sequences are to ""comic book"" ala Batman.

Then i watched it and saw the movie starting with Will messing with a call. Then Maureen comes to tell him to stop then many times later the movie began crap. I think this is the worst movie yet from Matt LeBlanc and Gary Oldman. The movie about the future and has mutant aliens and badly made stuff this movie makes the worst movie i have seen since Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. The continuation with Zachary Smith as Spider Smith (in future) try to kill these people that came from there. Then at the end the Lost in Space song came at the credits.,Lost in Space
119,westley34,Horrible remake,2,22 April 2017,"This movie is downright awful. The special effects looks like a video game, even worse than most Syfy channel movies. Matt Leblanc was terribly miscast, he was laughable as Don West. The acting of many of the supporting actors was sub par for a fairly big budget movie with some pretty big name actors. Will Robinson's acting was either particularly bad or just unrealistic. There was no fear or sense of urgency present at all in him as he decommissioned the robot and saved his family and the space ship, as if he were just strolling in the park. I understand he is just a child actor but there are child actors that could have conveyed a sense of urgency there that would have been more fitting to what was happening (his entire family was seconds away from being slaughtered and he himself had just dodged death dealing rays from the robot). Maybe it was just really bad directing that caused him to act that way, but the end result is just another bad scene in a long line of bad scenes. I was being generous giving this 2 stars.",Lost in Space

I can't understand why so many people hated this film. Taken for what it is worth, it is an excellent, campy adventure.I wasn't ""wowed"" by the special effects as I was by the fact that they kept the ""campiness"" of the old show and mixed it in with some great action and comedy scenes.

The crass Silicone Graphics product placement could have been quite funny now 10 years later but when so many awful minor roles kept popping up I had to wonder if SGI executives were given minor acting roles as part of the collusion. Witness the launch announcer when Jupiter is taking off. I vote him for the worst actor of the century award - how about you? Then there is the costuming. Every member of the space family has either great plastic breasts on their suits sharp enough to take out an eye or if male Romanesque pectoral muscles. It just looks lame/distracting and completely unnecessary.I'm surprised we made it past the first scene with a space dog fight.. This might have just been a bit of fun but the scriptwriter felt it was necessary to have Joey (you know from Friends) say some really, really cheesy lines every 15 or so seconds. Again distracting - just for it's BADness.Perhaps the scriptwriters had been taking laxatives and it had effected their writing, some of the absolute worst dialogue can be found within this abomination of a movie.

As a die hard Lost In Space fan, I was totally horrified to discover that Hopkins actual screen tested Bill Mummy and blew him off. Mummy would have been perfect for the closing scene. The actors and actresses performed well, and I believe that good choices were made. But the material left much to be desired. This is why we have not seen or heard any talk of a sequel, even though the actors signed on for it. The only attraction this film had was the cameos from Goddard, Cartright, Kristen, and Lockhart. Jonathan Harris (AKA Dr. Smith) flat out refused to participate. With the DVD collection of the original series available in stores, this movie will remain lost in outer space.",Lost in Space

125,louiepatti,Lost in Space Lost its Charm,4,24 June 2006,"The few stars I'll give this muddle is for the clever plot twist of having Will save the day again---only this time, not as a little boy, but as an embittered adult. That's about the only merit to this film, along with bringing back the original robot's voice from the old series. Other than that, Hollywood ruined it. The original Irwin Allen production had so much good in it. The cast was professional, from Guy Williams as the father to Billy Mumy as the precocious but likable Will. The parents loved each other; the kids were important to their parents and each other, not to mention a far more mature-acting Major Don West; Zachary Smith, at first an evil genius capable of reprogramming the robot to obey only him, is then a perpetual self-serving whiner who was the only dysfunctional one in the group. The effects were cheesy and the writing sometimes not the greatest, but as a family show, it had charm. The characters were capable of drawing the viewers into caring about them. Sadly, the charm was drained right out of this movie to make it more ""contemporary"". Like its distant cousin Star Trek, Lost in Space would've transferred so much better from small screen to big if its creators had remembered a simple rule: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Both shows had existing fan bases waiting for the movie versions. Of course, it's unrealistic to expect absolutely no change whatsoever, but to alter the basic premise so drastically was to invite disaster. If alienating the fan base, the cast and crew should try to produce something seriously entertaining. This failed miserably. Special effects were okay; music was adequate; the story could have been better, though it didn't absolutely tank. The biggest problem was the cast. William Hurt lacked depth and projected no real sincerity as the father; Mimi Rodgers was annoying as the mother. Judy was portrayed as terrified of getting intimate with a man. Don was too young, not in years but in maturity; the original Don was impetuous but also knew how to take orders and wasn't such a cocky hotshot. The kid playing Will did all right and had a mischievous streak that actually was occasionally funny. Oldman, handed the thankless task of playing the role immortalized by the great Jonathan Harris, pulled it off enough to make Smith over into a purer embodiment of evil. The biggest mistake was how Penny was portrayed; she was utterly ruined, a spoiled self-centered brat that evoked no sympathy whatsoever until the movie was practically finished. It's a shame. As one reviewer noted, it would've been a real coup if they'd cast Bill Mumy as the adult Will. And why couldn't the powers-that-be come up with a role for Harris, when they were able to for Lockhart, Kristen, Cartwright and Goddard? This could've been a good story about a family's misadventures in space travel. Instead, it became a ponderous mess about a typical Hollywood concept of the American-family-as-totally-dysfunctional-disaster. That's what turned this into a disaster.",Lost in Space

But that's to be expected from a summer sci-fi blockbuster.  Heck, the 5th Element had all of the above, and it was a lot of fun!  But it had two things LS doesn't: a sense of fun, and good special effects.  Just about everything in Lost in Space is dimly lit, ugly, and depressing.  The action feels peculiarly suspense-free -- never has a movie blown up its entire cast and still not managed to move the viewer. And the special effects... I apparently am one of the few people on the planet who can tell GOOD CGI from BAD CGI.  That evil lizard-monkey thing and Dr. Smith's spider persona both were less-than-TV quality special-effects.  They didn't look like they were in the film, they just appeared to be cheaply matted on top of it.  They shimmered and flickered and blurred and failed to convince.  Ick.

Such an asinine claim can 'never' be true, as 'NO ONE' has that much time to blow by endlessly watching movies 'every' night and day. Lookee at all the superlatives? Such clap-trap.As far as LIS is concerned, what a humongous disappointment it was, indeed. My friend and I both felt cheated yet again at the cinema, just as yet another 'miss-the-boat-completely re-boot/remake had the same year, Roland Emmerich's equally-disastrous, Godzilla.But let's look at this version of LIS, as a totally-independent entity and on its own merit. There is no merit, other than the hefty 80 mil price tag for its production. The casting may have worked had there been effective direction, but the 'who-cares?' script and ensuing plot developments squashed that. Jack Johnson, as the young Will Robinson, was the only believable character I cared a tinker's cuss for in this whole mess. Gary Oldman's weird Dr. Smith seemed just weird for weirdness's sake, like he was so bizarrely in ""The Fifth Element"". William Hurt and Mimi Rogers might as well have phoned in their performances as Mr. and Mrs. Robinson (maybe they did, come to think of it), and Penny, played by Lacey Chabert, was the snotty and sassy teen we all love to hear bemoan the suckiness of everything. Matt LeBlanc's Don West was...Matt LeBlanc, and his interactions with Heather Graham, as the oldest Robinson sibling (does the name matter?), had no chemistry, whatsoever. What efforts were put into these characters' performances seemed misguided and pointless (except for Will's), most likely from the inept direction.The wacko monsters were a fun part of the TV series, but the creatures in the movie fell flat as a pancake (the CGI spiders and that stupid and god-awful pet thing, whose appearance tolled the death knell of this flick's fun potential). Any resemblance to the TV series and this movie appeared to be entirely coincidental...The Jupiter 2 was cool, so I've rated this movie a 2, out of respect for the best 'character' of LIS.",Lost in Space

The story is set relatively fast and it's all excitement and buzz as they set off into the wilds of space, unfortunately things go wrong and they run into a few problems.The first hour holds great promises, it actually feels like they are about to set off on a truly great adventure. It's beautifully shot and space looks almost like it would in a comic book, bright, colourfull and shiny. but soon enough the ship crashes and with it the adventure is sorta crumbled by the plot.There's a central element of the plot which is a total pile of %^&*. I wont spoil it but it really destroys the film and not only by being illogical but chiefly because it drags it out of the science fiction realm and is used to turn it into a totally cliché and hackneyed melodrama, the kind which science fiction and adventure fans generally do not like. That's the main problem here, it gets soppy, it gets sentimental it gets predictable. How many movies have to do this? why do they make viewers suffer?

(Disney, rights holder to ""Swiss Family Robinson"", forced a last-minute title change). The first episode actually broadcast, ""The Reluctant Stowaway"", was barely-plausible drama and featured a purely-evil Dr. Zachary Smith.Allen slowly converted his clunky space operetta into a comedy of errors, highlighting Jonathan Harris's comic side as a more buffoonish Smith. It worked, despite the howls of critics. For the big-screen tribute to this vanished Sixties world, director and screenwriter unwisely copy the original idea.The updated script rings acceptable changes on the premise of sending a single family to colonize space. One wouldn't expect a slavish copy of the pilot's scenario. Drama over comedy, however, doesn't cut it. Gary Oldman, chilling as Ludwig van Beethoven, seems straight out of an Up All Night horror flick as Dr. Smith. The character could have been nicknamed Igor instead of Zack.I don't hold opinions about child actors. As the parents, William Hurt and Mimi Rogers are interesting substitutes for Zorro and Mrs. Lassie.

That is:The subplot about Smith as bug(this is a spoiler, Sorry!) I was an assistant to Irwin Allen for 1yr before he died, and I have to say if he could have seen Gary Oldham play Smith, he would have cheered for joy! The first few black and white episodes of the first season, show Johnathan Harris as a cool, evil, totally phony acting villain--he has con jobbed the family into thinking he is an innocent victim, and a nice guy. Oldham does this perfectly-channeling the spirit of Harris as Smith, Spot on accurate Oldham makes this film what it is--true LIS updated for a hipper, more psychologically adept audience. I Love the family dynamic--even Major West is included as a sort of ""grudgingly accepted necessary evil"" Because he's the only guy Judy is ever going to have as her mate(whether she likes him or not!) Also, the incredibly prescient scripting Goldsman does-- he creates the family as a real family--one that feels, thinks, fights amongst themselves, and has real psychological concerns-- to wit: Penny's voice/video journal, where she tells what she'll miss not being a kid on earth:Kissing,Movies, Malls,Kissing,Boys, Kissing""--she too knows, once they are officially cut off, that she's doomed sexually and emotionally wise--there ain't no one for her! Oldham's Smith is a devious but strangely sympathetic tortured soul, too---he is evil, but he is evil only because he is greedy! He was in the pay of the ""enemy"" and this is what got him in trouble! He tries hard to survive on his own terms, but is outnumbered by the idealistic family, and the heroic and generally all around nice guy, West. We see too, some hint of Smith's psychological needs too--he kisses up to Maureen(a major babe) and Judy(a younger major babe) in a very thinly disguised seduction mode--he too knows there ain't no other available women.All in all, this movie rules!

All of the cameos supplied by the original cast were excellent, although I wanted older Will Robinson to be played by Billy Mumy.  Sure many of the plot angles were screwy, but so was the original series.  As for all the boring comments, I just don't understand... I thought the pacing was tight. 
In fact, one of the worst and most boring movies ever made from a science-fiction TV series was Star Trek I -- and it's a blessing for all of us that the studios didn't abandon the concept after the original turkey directed by Robert Wise.  The one thing I will agree with is that William Hurt played the same boring and egocentric character he always seems to play these days and bore no resemblance to the soul of Guy William's John Robinson.

Even with the newer designs, they incorporated older aspects - the planet REALLY looked like a better version of one of their old sets.Furthermore, Oldman managed to peg Dr. Smith perfectly, taking in all the old camp elements and putting them to very good use - even using some old catch phrases in different ways.As diversionary, light sci-fi adventure goes, I thought this was great and I'm usually very picky about this kind of thing. It was fun and a pretty good kids' movie.The only thing really missing was Billy Mumy.",Lost in Space

The movie promissed something, in the beginning, but one knew, after only 10 minutes, that it would turn out to be of the most idiotic things produced by Hollywood.  I made the mistake of buying the video, after all, I had not seen the movie. Big mistake. Every once in a while I make one... It´s a shame to see William Hurt and Gary Oldman in such a terrible thing. If doubts existed about the competence (or lack of it) of Hopkins (the director), they were all cleared. The man shouldn´t direct a comercial, let alone a movie...  The special effects seemed more appropriate for a cartoon than for a movie...  The plot is a joke.

147,teutonicknight,Somebody broke wind!!!,1,31 March 2003,"I remember one episode of ""Friends"" in which  Joey Triviani (Matt Le Blanc) is talking about his first day on set for some TV series. One of the actors taught him how to act a state of deep thinking (musing in other words). In general you have to play as if somebody broke wind and you are trying to smell it (more or less sth like that), the result is very serious and concentrated face. OK Matt, let me put it this way: ""Fiends"" is a sitcom, so what you said there was just for fun, this advice wasn't serious, and really you don't have to try to smell something stinking in every movie you play in (unless it's a comedy, you know).I hope Matt is going to read it, because in ""LiS"" he did this ugly thing every time somebody was talking to him (eg. when he learnt that he would be a pilot of the ship).And now, the film.BAAAAAAAAD, EVEN WOOOOOOOORSE.

148,north-julie,a big dumb movie with great effects,6,15 April 2006,"There are some striking special effects scenes that we have witnessed over the years. From asteroids hitting the earth to dinosaurs roaming, we have seen some pretty spectacular scenes. However, a film full of great effects is not a great film. Lost In Space is a prime example of this.When the Earth is dying in the future, it is predicted that we will search for a new home. This is the crux of Lost In Space, as the (swiss family) Robinson attempt to fly their pretty boring looking spaceship to the other end of the galaxy to colonise a planet called alpha prime. Onboard is the usual group of family members- self obsessed dad, intelligent but ignored son, angry wife and bickering daughters. Also onboard is Matt Le Blanc, star of friends.There is a couple of problem within the casting of the crew. Heather Graham (playing the eldest child) is improbably beautiful for a scientist. She also comes out with one of the worst quotes in history ('i don't like the sound of that sound').Unsurprisingly, there are those who oppose the idea of an alternative planet being found for the human race. One such man is Gary Oldmans character Smith. He spouts bizarre monologues that sound like the bits that Shakespeare chopped from his plays. He tries to kill the Robinson family and hotwires the unnecessary robot so that it goes crazy and damages the ship. From here, the crew is lost.There are many problems with this film. Gary Oldman, a great actor in the fifth element and leon, is not exactly the most threatening of bad guys in this movie. he snivels and weasels his way through the film, finding himself endlessly punched by Le Blanc. The random space monkey that the crew encounter is poorly recognised by cheap effects, and is a pointless addition. Heather graham is not a scientist. The ship is boring to look at. and on, and on....The film also has silly leaps of logic. The spiders that the crew come up against onboard the floating spaceship are clearly robotic, yet have a predators teeth. They are able to bite their way through the hull of the ship, and yet ten minutes later the ship flies through the atmosphere of a planet without even suffering a scratch. I'm no scientist but surely an incredibly hot atmosphere is stronger than a spiders teeth??? The ship manages to fly THROUGH THE SUN! i don't care how fast they are going, thats surely impossible! However, a movie like this is bound to be full of effects, and Lost In Space doesn't disappoint. The destruction of the Proteus spaceship is spectacular as the Robinsons ship wheels away from the expanding fireball. And the final flight through the planet is great fun to. Matt Le Blanc plays his role well, looking heroic and not taking himself too seriously. He is unintentionally hilarious when the robot is malfunctioning and he flies through the air to land on its back. And his pathetic attempts to flirt with Heather Grahams depressed looking scientist add welcome heart to the film.If it wasn't for the budget, this film would definitely receive a lower grade. The story may be dull and the acting fairly mediocre, but Lost In Space isn't trying to be Solaris. It just wants to entertain, and no matter how much you try, you cannot truly say that this film bores you.",Lost in Space

When Matt Le Blanc (Major Don West) utters to his fellow fighter pilots in about the third line of the movie, ""Last one to kill a bad guy has to buy the beer"" you know that this movie is going to be a deep disappointment.The scriptwriter completely missed the point.  The strength of the original series, hokum, cheap and laughable although it was, was the relationship between Dr Smith, Will Robinson and the robot.  Instead of focusing on this in the script, he has attempted to bludgeon the viewer with computer animated explosions and ""witty"" asides which frankly not even the most juvenile of viewer would find amusing.All in all this is an overlong and pathetic attempt to cash in on what was a surprise hit on T.V.

153,plu4085,Future turkey classic,3,18 October 2006,"There are movies that get a bad reception but turn out to be pretty good, or at least original, when actually viewed. ""Waterworld"" is one such item. Could ""Lost in space"" be another? No. It's a disaster. Man, it was worse than I expected it to be. Here's why: 1. Incredibly bad script with holes so big you could lead a 30-feet Ed Wood robot through it. Especially the last 20 minutes were an unbelievable mess. I can't recall seeing such an abundance of logical errors, contradicting developments, and inexplicable behavior by the main characters since ""Plan 9"" 2. Terrible casting. The choices are either too obvious (Gary Oldman, the annoying brat from ""Party of 5""), misguided (William Hurt, Matt Leblanc) or bizarre (Mimi Rogers). Heather Graham might have worked, but spends the movie like on a Valium OD. The only thing that worked was the little kid.3. Terrible acting. You get a feeling after only 5 minutes that this is one of those movies where the director hasn't decided if it's supposed to be ironic or serious. The actors automatically throw in the towel and walk around in a sleepwalking daze... William Hurt and Heather Graham in particular. Mimi Rogers is just embarrassing, as is ""Joey"" from Friends who tries HARD in his first (last?) major movie part, and contorts his face into various cool/annoyed/dedicated/sly/horny/etc disguises, hoping one of them will be appropriate for the scene. I felt sorry for the guy.4. The annoying brat from ""Party of 5"" is given a Generation Y (or Z) part which is supposed to close the generation gap between little girls who'll want to see this movie, and their parents who remember the LIS TV series and think it might be fun. Clever, yes? No. It stinks. After she pops up for the 8th time to rattle off some cool ""as-if"" phrases into the camera you just want to scream. Not to mention that the little Gen Z girls may not exactly enjoy seeing a Spider God being eaten by its own baby spiders.5. Here are a few questions to the director and the people who approved the script: - The older Will in the cave has built a time machine through which he can go back and put an end to the Jupiter 2 mission before it starts. Fair enough. But instead, he puts his father in the machine, and sends him onto the ship in terrible peril, thus negating the premise of his whole work. Why? Why? WHY? - Dr Smith has apparently turned into a ""spider god"" at the end. His goal is to jump into the time/space machine and take over Earth. The older Will kills him off by... throwing him into the time/space machine. Why? Why? WHY? - As the Robinsons make it back to the ship from the ""bubble"" they make sure to take the super-evil Dr Smith with them, rescuing him from a certain death. Aargh! Why? Why? WHY? 6. 15 years from now, when all the actors and the hype and backlash are forgotten, this movie will be viewed as a major turkey classic.

155,eskdale56,Dreadful...,4,2 March 2002,"That's right I think this was dreadful--Matt LeBlanc's acting was poor, William Hurt seems too passive and not the man in control portrayed by Guy Williams and the kid who played Will was no Billy Mumy either.  The first part of the movie plot was directly taken from the TV show and then somewhere in the middle it zooms off into left field.  The movie was neither campy like the TV show, nor was it a sci fi movie that I could say I found any interest in.  Dr. Smith was made to be far more sinister than Jonathan Harris's portrayal of the character (a coward, nelly queen, but soft inside) with no redeeming qualities--Gary Oldman is a very good actor--plays wonderful bad guys...but he wasn't right for this part, much too dark.  If they hadn't tracked the original TV plot for half the movie, perhaps I wouldn't have found myself comparing it to the TV show so much.

Two actual good actors, Gary Oldman and William Hurt, are trapped in this atrociously written, badly directed waste of $80 million. Whether or not you liked the cheesy 60s TV series, you're going to hate this.Alright, this is how it goes: it's the future and there's pollution, world peace (ugh!), and terrorists. The Robinson family is going to fly through a ""hyper-space-portal"" (or whatever the hell they call it) to a planet on the other side of the galaxy to colonize it and save humanity. Hurt, playing a respected scientist with no time for his kids, says at a press conference ""there's a lot of space out there to get lost in"" (ugh!). Matt LeBanc from ""Friends"" is horribly miscast as the flying ace who will pilot the Robinson's earth-saving space ship. Then we come to the children... but we wish we hadn't. The little boy is a science-fair genius who wishes his dad had more time for him and the girl is a teenage stereotype who argues with her mother and keeps a video diary. They both have very high, annoying voices, and the lines they deliver are terrible on top of that. Then comes the mother. I don't know who played her, and I don't want to know. They all live in a futuristic house in a futuristic CGI geodesic dome (ugh!). Except for family tensions ""I don't want to give up the next ten years of my life"", the mission appears to be a shoe-in.Then we meet Gary Oldman, the 1998 version of Dr. Smith. He would have been a terrific character if his lines weren't so terrible (I think Akiva Goldsman was trying for Shakespearian). Anyway, he's evil and loves it, and works for the terrorists. He sabotages to mission, getting himself trapped on the ship in the process, and getting the Robinsons lost you know where.Along the way we see thoroughly unconvincing CGI used for just about everything, including an annoying monkey-creature that's supposed to be cute. The costumes (which director Hopkins had a hand in designing) are really terrible glossy-body-mold stuff (think BATMAN AND ROBIN for comparison) which basically gives everybody (even the kids) well defined ahem!- features. Even the music is bad, and horribly arranged. And the end titles go above and beyond tacky, being half music-video, including a rapped-over version of the original theme and sound-bites from the film. And then there's the robot, which the son makes friends with and teaches that it has a ""heart"" (ugh!).The script and direction are still probably the worst atrocities in LOSTIN SPACE. One of the more embarrassing bits has LeBlanc explaining to Heather Graham (to whom he is pathetically attracted) the concept of constellations and draws Porky Pig on a window. Even during intimate dialogue scenes, none of our actors seem sincere, or even to be speaking to one another. These characters don't even talk like human beings.It's hard to believe the studio didn't just put this one on the shelf and leave it there. In the end LOST IN SPACE didn't even make enough money to justify its release. The world really would be a better place without this movie.",Lost in Space
163,brianwolters,Highly Entertaining,7,4 January 2005,"Lost in Space is one of those movies where you may not have liked it when you first saw it but when given a 2nd chance, you will find it very entertaining. First of all, the original series was never one to be thought provoking. It was intended to be pure adventure and at the same time be campy fun. Where else could you see people battle a monster and then sit down to milk and cookies? Or better yet, bake a birthday cake for a robot?? That said, you will see some of the same campiness in Lost in Space the movie. The problem is that most people wont expect that and that may turn them off. Expect it and enjoy it. The movie introduces us to all of the central characters in a hurry, but it works. And as the TV show, they are thrown off course due to Dr. Smith (though his extra weight had nothing to do with it in the film.) Once they are lost, the movie takes on a life of its own. There is an exciting sequence aboard a derelict ship and an ensuing crash. Once on the planet, the story bogs down in a time travel plot that is confusing, full of holes, yet it holds your interest. The acting and the choice of actors in the film are among the best aspects of Lost in Space. While I was afraid William Hurt would be miscast, he came off rather well. To me, Gary Oldman, though he was good and had SOME ""Smith"" qualities to him, came the closest to being miscast. Maybe if by some chance we are given a sequel to this film (which was left VERY WIDE open) Smith will become the ""villain"" that he was in the original show. I still think Billy Mumy could have been used in a scene later in the movie. Also look for cameo's from the original Penny and Judy and a significant role from the original Don. Also, the voice of the Robot is the same as in the show. That was a nice touch. The DVD is a pure joy. The sound quality is still one of the best around.

Starring Matt LeBlanc, hot off the hit sitcom Friends, and boasting a terrific ensemble cast that includes Heather Graham and a scene-stealing Gary Oldman, Lost in Space is a fun, special effects-laden adventure romp with wholesome family values. It follows the Robinson family, shot off into space to find a planet suitable for the inhabitants of Earth to relocate to. However, a dastardly stowaway, Doctor Zachary Smith (played by Gary Oldman, gleefully channeling series original Jonathan Harris)and a malevolent Robot, send the Robinsons and their wise-cracking pilot Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) off course - and ultimately Lost in Space. There's plenty of gung-ho action and arresting visuals. And more importantly, the characters are engaging and their plight enjoyable. It's such a shame that a sequel never materialized.

Maureen Robinson threatens to declare her husband and the major unfit for duty (for arguing) without regard to who's going to fly the ship or what effect it would have on her marriage. I thought it was curious for her to start a p****ing contest of her own on the premise that the two men were wrongfully engaging in one themselves.Heather Graham does not add much in her role as a doctor. I can think of two actresses (Jeri Ryan, Linda Fiorentino) who could have done better and there are probably dozens who could have done equally as well.The two youngest Robinsons were good in their roles. The inhibited teenage daughter was well done by Lacey Chabert and Jack Johnson played the young scientist convincingly.Jonathan Pryce would have made a better intellectual villain as Dr. Smith, but Matt LeBlanc and William Hurt were OK in their roles as the Major and Professor Robinson respectively.All in all, I'd give it a 6 out of 10.",Lost in Space

If you just dumped the really corny episodes, you'd have a series that delivers fairly decent sci-fi adventure and entertainment.Now comes the long-awaited movie. I was jazzed when I saw the previews. When the movie finally came out, I left the theater shaking my head. The director and screenwriter should be punished for squandering such a potentially hot property.With the exception of William Hurt, I liked the casting. The great choices are Mimi Rogers as Maureen, Matt Leblanc as Don, and Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith. To a lesser extent, other decent players are Heather Graham as Judy, Lacey Chabert as Penny, and Jack Johnson as Will. But the script deals them all a fatal blow. Why does Judy have to be a doctor all of a sudden? Can't Penny be nice and less whiny? Would they really put little Will in charge of ""robotics?"" Please. The original series gave the kids some good qualities, but let them act their age and didn't push it too far.Gary Oldman plays the right mix of personality flaws to make a great Dr. Smith. His storyline is not too bad until the unfortunate turn of events at the end.William Hurt was the big mistake here. The crew has no reason to follow his character's attempt to give orders. He should have been left home in a lab somewhere. Even Maureen emasculates him fairly easily. Guy Williams as John Robinson more than held his own as a husband, father and sparring partner for Don in the original - a true leader. Hurt is a great actor, no doubt, but his Robinson is annoying and has no command presence. It's not pretty when the kids don't listen to him but Don is forced to submit to his (?) authority.Speaking of Don, Leblanc could have played him in a ""major"" way if this movie script had not reduced him to an immature boor. Too bad.Now for the robot... he was clearly established as a main character in the series. But in the movie, besides saying ""Danger Will Robinson"" about 659 times, he/it looks more like a tank than a mechanical man. How enduring can that be? At least the classic old model could look friendly or scary, shake your hand, zap a few bad guys, and then make you believe he had feelings. This new model gets destroyed before anyone has any ""bonding"" time, and then the kid rebuilds him to look like one of the tortured mutant toys from Toy Story.As for Jar Jar Binks the space-chimp-teletubby... let's not waste any more thought. Things are bad enough already. CG characters in live-action movies should be banned by the Screen Actors' Guild.The story is the biggest offense in this movie. Dysfunctional family takes some wrong turns and has to deal with the future. Action scenes that play more like video games. Once again, I can only lament... why didn't they ask me (or anyone else for that matter) how to make a decent TV show-based movie???",Lost in Space
176,Prozacc,What a waste...,3,9 November 1998,"The effects in this film were pretty spectacular all around, except for the Blawp (Blarp?) which was simply horrible, no better than Roger Rabbit. The problem with this film was the screenplay. Now, I'm not going to sit here and whine that all movies should be works of art, with great character development and scripts that are literary works of art. I LIKE blockbuster movies. But what I do demand in any film is that it have some kind of cohesive quality. This one didn't.The plot was ridiculous. Okay, I could live with that, but not only was it ridiculous, it was inherently flawed, confusing, contradictory (the mortal sin) and worst of all, it didn't actually end! When the closing credits came on I had to check my DVD player to make sure it hadn't skipped a track. I understand the idea that it's episodic, but I felt absolutely cheated of the previous two hours because I was given no feeling of closure.Having said that, the effects were good and the acting was passable (except for LeBlanc, who I thought improved as the film went on but couldn't make up for his sleepwalking through the first few scenes).

179,Shingle,Danger humans...it came from TV land!,4,9 January 2000,"Most TV adaptations, with the exception of Mission Impossible', haven't really had much of a big impact at the box office. Take for example Sgt Bilko, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Saint. The 60's TV series Lost In Space was given a quite a huge multi-million makeover. The end result is something that should have made the film get chucked in the bin with the rest of the TV adaptations but it seemed obvious enough that it'd be a success mainly due to the two words `special effects'. Matt LeBlanc might also have had an affect!!!  So what's the excuse for thousands of special effects now?  Well the film is set in the year 2058 and the future doesn't look too good. You see experts predict that 20 years from now the planet will be plummeted with pollution if things keep going on the way they are now. So the Robinson family decide to take a ten-year expedition into space so that they can try and save Earth. The Robinson's bring along Major Don West (LeBlanc) as their pilot and accidentally bring along Dr Smith (Oldman) who was on board the ship to sabotage the mission except he gets trapped himself after take off. And it's Oldman's tampering with big toys that causes the ship to steer way off course and that's how the family end up lost in space.  The film starts off with a highly impressive opening sequence involving a dogfight in space with bubble crafts. I was beginning to hope that the rest of the movie would be this good but unfortunately the opening is the best part of the film. The film then flies through a slightly complicated storyline and almost becomes increasingly confusing in the last half-hour where probabilities about time travel are unleashed. The film ends up leaving you more lost then the family!  Fans of the TV series (if any still exist) are obviously going to enjoy this but may find the difference to the TV series and film a little getting used to. I sure in hell remember the TV series but wasn't a big fan of that in the first place. Anyone who has never seen or even heard of the TV series will find this a stunning special effects adventure with a silly storyline as an excuse.  Disappointing, but still, not bad. Plus that Apollo Four Forty revamp of the TV theme tune must get a mention as a seriously top track!My rating - 6 out of 10",Lost in Space
180,johngraham64,Not as bad as you think...,6,2 September 2007,"OK so maybe it wasn't that good... but it was a spirited attempt with some lovely knowing winks back to the original TV series (the outer casing the Jupiter 2 launches in mimics the original ship, for example).The basic plot premise that sends out the Robinsons into space recalls the original pilot, as does the sabotage by Dr Smith (Gary Oldman doing his best - and fun - Jonathan Harris impression).Casting is a bit up and down. I can't warm to William Hurt and he does come across as quite unlovable. Maureen's character doesn't get much to do. Will and Penny are OK and at least Will doesn't come across as one of those modern-day child actors (never show me Star Wars I!!!).Don West is suitably photogenic and has obviously worked out for the role. Judy falls for him but I'm sure it's purely physical! Hey - who needs character development??? It all comes apart when they crash land on the planet and travel in time . I mean, why not let older Will travel back and stop it all happening? That would save the entire family and Dr Smith and stop them being lost all in one go. Ah well....I would have liked to have seen a sequel though. The effects were good and popping in ex-cast members in cameos was greatly appreciated - and the original voice of the robot! Much more could have been done with it in Lost In Space 2....DANGER, WILL ROBINSON! DANGER!",Lost in Space

I was 19, and starved for good, intelligent sf movie. I remember I wasn't paying too much attention to this movie, I watched it again later, now I can say I've seen it a few times on TV or DVD. I haven't seen the original US series, but the movie is a nice family flick, the bad thing is that it wasn't meant to be one. Le Blanc is quite cool as an action hero I was very surprised not seeing him doing some action flick in the next years. All in all it's a warm popcorn movie, with Gary Oldman, who is in a way catoonish villain, Will Hurt as a serious father gone too much interested in his work. Both are fine actors, both weren't themselves in this one. Special effects are quite nice for those times, though the creature animation is a bit corny.

182,Seller7861,4.6 is too low,10,10 September 2006,"When I see Lisztomania with a higher rating then something has gone terribly wrong.The film didn't do for Lost In Space what Mission Impossible did for that sure I grant you, but this movie is well worth watching.I think Science Fiction is gender specific. Men like it much more than women, therefore Sci Fi movies will have a hard time getting an accurate rating from sites like this.I have trouble with the casting in this film. The screen writing also lacked. But the special effects were good. The politically correct storyline had a nice trajectory (btw, the Ozone layer which was predicted to be gone by now has heeled itself). Overall this is a popcorn film that family audiences can enjoy as much as teens on a date.The Robinson family are explorers and good Samaritans. Their noble quest is to save the earth by helping to build a portal to ""Alpha Prime"". Shortly after lift off they become lost and the fun begins.People always have trouble with Time travel angles in these films and this is no exception. But Sci-Fi films require active suspension of disbelief. If you go to this or any Sci-Fi film looking for a plot without holes you will be disappointed. The audience has to fill in the holes and if you have a cynical or doubting-Thomas personality you will not like filling in the holes. Preferring that everything be laid out for you and not requiring the active participation of your own imagination.Here's my rating scale: A = 10/9 B= 8/7 C= 6/5 D = 4/3/2 F = 1/0I give this film a 7.",Lost in Space

They do such strange things, violating science fiction rules, that the last half is painful.The acting was OK.  Matt LeBlanc was pretty convincing; William Hurt was passionless, cold and forced; the rest of the cast played their parts about average, no complaints.The plot suffered from Armageddon-itis, they just barely escape about every 10 minutes and lots of things blow up without need.  Throw in the annoying world-saver type children and obligatory cute aliens and you have a very annoying movie.What there was of motivated, essential special effects were better than average, and some of the unexplained events at the beginning actually stimulated some thinking.All things considered, this was a movie that is ruined by trying to fit in every possible mass-market niche.

I've seen some films that had a few ""points of interest"" tacked on, but this one was video-game quality special effects, and the rest was attached to the film on a 3M Post It and then glossed over with a shiny lacquer.The family sentiment and heartfelt emotion isn't built, but slapped onto this movie in the form of one liners.  Little girls telling you not to love anything, because you'll only lose it... and then walking away.  Does this sentiment play in the movie?  Only for the time it takes her to say that line.Little boy explains friendship to robot in one scene.  Hmm... how could this be more transparent?Action is done cool, with lines like ""Pedal to the metal!"" ""Rock and Roll!"" and my favorite: ""I don't like the sound of that sound.""  But the thrill ride everyone seemed so excited about is nothing more than previews for the video game.The bright spot of this film was Gary Oldman.  He hams it up as the whining doctor, but he is also menacing in ways the TV show never was.  His innocent smile and reassurances (Yes. I'm a doctor.) are fantastic, and I have a feeling he enjoyed cartooning himself out for this role.But even if Oldman was an enjoyable cartoon, the movie was shallow.  Ankle deep.  It makes me remember when I thought Transformers was a wonderful show, and reading the positive reviews here, I smile on that naiveté... and remember my disappointment the first time I saw that show as an adult.

I hoped to see something better than a cheap copy of an old script which was a hit when I saw it on TV. But what I saw was a nonsensical story based on an old Sitcom. I am not against sequels following a hit performed by the same actors, and written by the same people, but to try to refresh an old story using different actors is merely a proof that new writers and directors are not intelligent enough to create a new story from scratch. Or maybe writers and directors of the past were simply better. Either way, this kind of remake is just a sample of the decadence of the movies industry, where no new ideas are brought to the screen, and that it is cheaper and requires less imagination to bring back to life something which was great forty years ago, not taking into account that we (spectators) have memory, and the ability to compare the original with a cheap copy.

192,faded_Glory,Total train wreck,1,29 May 2005,"A lot of people here relate to the original 60-ies TV series and seem to be rather generous in their criticism of this film. Maybe it brings back fond memories of our younger days, or whatever, but let's face it: when one judges this movie in its own right it simply sucks.The start of it is a Starwars rip-off space battle between the good guys and the bad guys. This time the Rebellion are the bad guys, they call themselves 'Global Sedition' - as if! One of the interesting facts of real life is that the bad guys consider themselves in fact the good guys, and wouldn't call themselves 'seditionists' anymore than, say, Joseph Stalin would have called his Communist Party the Party of the Gulag Mass Murders. Or something like that. Anyway, I can see they had to turn things around for fear of lawsuits from George Lucas.During the next half hour or so we are bombarded with a veritable diarrhea of clichés. The brave but not so bright military hero who disobeys direct orders when he feels like it, and of course always turns out to be right; the workaholic professor who dislikes the military and neglects his family; the smart and handsome young female doctor who has no time for romance; evil fiends who want to sabotage the oh-so important mission (Saving Mankind, no less of course!); the nerdy little boy who is so clever with computers that he will eventually save the day; and so on and so forth, yawn yawn, you name it, it's there, we have seen it all hundreds of times before and hundreds of times better.Once the space ship gets under way, things go wrong, of course, and the plot plods painfully along its pitifully predictable path. Special effects, big blasts, a mysterious abandoned spacecraft, evil alien monsters (spiders??? Who the heck came up with spiders? Why not stick with the trusty old bug-eyed monsters? Not trying to be original, are we?) Of course our heroes survive all that, and even gain a cute little alien friend (ET phone home and all that) but it is in the last part of the movie that the writers obviously lost it completely, and for fear of having no more to show for the money than a bog-standard space opera decided to throw in some completely incomprehensible drivel about time travel and meeting the future egos of some of the main characters. All semblance of story line, character development or even elementary logic is recklessly thrown out of the window, and the poor viewers are left with nothing else but more special effects and some tear-jerking schlock to seduce them away from the merciful grace of the remote control STOP button. Wrapping up this poor old turd takes ages, at some point I even feared that there was another sub-plot coming, but thankfully it all of a sudden ended with a bang in mid-flight - ready for a sequel? God help us all.The acting? Well, they got paid for it, didn't they, so I guess they go through the motions. The special effects? Yeah, sure.

193,Gyaos,Excellent film based on old television series.,10,19 October 1998,"The Lost In Space television series was one of my favorites when I was growing up so when I found out that it was the basis for a new movie, trepidation is the word that best described my reaction. As it turns out, my fears were unfounded as the result is one of the best, if not the best, treatment of older material and characters ever. Unlike this year's other movie based on a cultural icon, namely Godzilla, the producers of Lost In Space have a great deal of respect for the original tv series and this shows in the finished product. They have been able to update the story and characters, even changing the tenor of the story from farce to serious drama without losing any of appeal of the original. The inclusion of June Lockhart, Marta Kristen, Angela Cartwright and Mark Goddard in cameos and minor parts adequately demostrates the respect the production team has for the fans of the original series, which helps immensely in this adaptation. This is something that Mssrs. Devlin & Emmerich need to learn before unleashing any more destruction of cultural icons as they did this summer.All in all, the movie is great family adventure entertainment. The story is simple enough, told in a caring way and is suitable for all ages. The acting well done, the writing & direction good and the visual effects rank amongst some of the best ever committed to celluloid.Definitely one of my favorites and quite possibly one of the best science fiction films of all times.

He acts out his character with extreme stupidity, and when he tries to look like he's thinking or doing something intellectual, he merely squints his eyes.A lot of the things that happens in the movie have no point. For example, on the ship they come across, they find a small yellow alien creature. It's cute, yeah, but it doesn't do anything! It sticks around for the rest of the movie just sitting there and making dumb noises.The greatest problem was that they spent far too much time on the special effects and less time on finding good actors or good plot.

First let's look at the basic for the movie. Lost in Space was a television show from 1965 that was very low budget. I. Allen had to work from a shoestring and it showed. The show was a ""kiddies"" show, something that the kids enjoyed while Mom and Dad was able to snicker at the goofiness of it, (but not too loudly or the kids might get mad). Then the show progress into one that centered around three characters, that of Will Robinson, Dr. Smith, and the Robot. Mr. And Mrs. Robinson, Major West, and the girls were just so much window dressing and fodder. This is what the director of the movie, Lost In Space, had to work with. Either he kept as close to the original show as he could or he struck out in a totally different direction, such as what happen when they made Wanted Dead Or Alive for the big screen.

Unfortunately, the director's aim is to poor that it all manages to miss just about everybody.  Sadly, June Lockhart's cameo role was the high point of the movie, and after the ship left the ground the movie just went downhill.

The very talented Oldman is pretty much wasted as the sneaky Dr.Smith,but even so he's still the best thing in the film,with a few good lines(particularly the ""coward"" one) Leblanc proves why he willalways be known as the ""dumb guy from Friends"" with his dull performance as Major West, the hotshot fighter pilot.

209,valmont7,Oh the pain... the pain!,1,9 July 1999,"I'm an ardent fan of the original series.  It's campy, full of ridiculous costumes, implausible situations, tawdry effects, and corny dialogue. It's not really science fiction;  at no time does anything resembling science affect the story.  The Robinsons are lost in space simply as an excuse to encounter, week after week, a dazzling array of bizarre, outlandish characters on their way to somewhere else.  There is just enough danger to hold our interest, but the Robinsons behave in all things as if they are on a camping trip.  Jonathan Harris's Doctor Smith is a queen of the first magnitude.  He has *style*.  His persistent sabotage is not motivated by a truly evil character, but rather by a truly selfish one.  Nonetheless, we cannot fail to sense his genuine affection for Will and Penny, who always seem to end up under his supervision.  The special bond between Smith and Will really is the heart of the show.Everything bright and beautiful about the series is utterly absent from the movie.  The movie seems to spring from a vision completely hostile to the spirit of the TV series.  The special effects are all too much.  The design is too slick.  Far too much effort is spent on trying to make everything realistic, except the characters themselves, who are mere shadows of their TV counterparts.",Lost in Space

If he was next to me after i saw the movie, which gave me a terrible headache from the nerves, I would have strangled the guy. What annoyed me the worse is that it could have been made a good movie from that story. The last third of the movie is absolute rubbish, nothing makes sense anymore, the actors act like they have no idea about the script and there's someone on the set telling them their lines while they're 'acting'. I expected an average SF movie, maybe average-to-nice movie, due to William Hurt and Gary Oldman in the cast.

He just cannot be convincing and believable enough in a role like that. He might be good in comedies and that's fine, just don't try to put him in an adventure movie like this one.Another big problem is the annoying little girl. I know that probably making her annoying and irritating was intentional, but why? The only purpose of that character is to make the movie less enjoyable and more irritating when she is on screen.Other actors are perfectly fine, William Hurt is fantastic and every scene built around him is very enjoyable, but those two mentioned above really ruin the mood of the movie.The special effects are another big problem. It is not just that they are bad, I usually don't even complain about special effects, but in this case they are not just bad, in many cases they feel completely out of place just like Matt LeBlanc does.There are so many immersion breaking things in this movie and obviously it cannot do what it is supposed to do because of that (escapism).It is such a shame because, a few minor details aside, the story is very good, the ending is miraculously good (an ending like this would have been awful in every other movie, but in this one it works wonderfully because it makes sense in a movie that is supposed to feel like a pilot episodde rather than a common movie), and as I said William Hurt is great too, and I just like the concept of this movie really a lot, but as I said there are too many things that just feel wrong and out of place in it.",Lost in Space

Just when you've made your mind up on this point, it changes your mind for you!I found Matt LeBlanc unconvincing as the macho pilot, and while the performances from Mr. Hurt and and Mr. Oldman were of high standard, the only performance I really got a kick out of was the young actor who played Will Robinson.I would be interested in seeing a sequel, if only in the hope that the Robinson family's story reaches its full potential on the big screen - something that sadly was not quite achieved here.",Lost in Space

I would also like to point out that I was pleasantly surprised with the special effects in this timeless masterpiece based on the original idea by Irwin Allen.  My only criticisms are: 1.  The idea that the story was only supposed to be sixty years in our future, because in reality it should have been more like one hundred and sixty years in the future. 2.  I think it would have worked better to see Billy Mumy who was the original Will Robinson, play the adult Will's role in the film. I am sure I don't stand alone with this comment among the serious fans of the original Lost in Space show of the 1960s.

The score, adding so much emotion especially to the scene where the father watches the ship be destroyed. I felt so much power from the score there although not enough from William Hurt's performance here. The cinematography generated a lot of the film's excitement especially on the planet they crash land on.Although the flaws of the film come from within some of the acting as the director also isn't directing the actors to show enough power in most scenes but the director does show his talent in some places of the film, bringing out the epic scale and excitement. Also the writing isn't top notch as the sub-plots aren't handled well, bringing out the feeling that it is just another blockbuster. When it comes to writing, we've already seen sub-plots like this.But this does stand out over many action-blockbusters, keeping it's fun and the non-stop action in place which is a problem for many action films. I definitely agree that this is underrated and should get about a 6/10 rating. I haven't seen any episodes of the TV series but for the people that have, i believe that they have compared them 2, having the film be rated lower...e.g, the new star wars films may be rated higher if the older ones didn't exist because there isn't anything better to compare them with.",Lost in Space

I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across ""Lost in Space"". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not?Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clichés. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all.Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in ""Friends"". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine.Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. ""Spider"" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says ""Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor."" I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying "". . . And a pervert"". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again.So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away.

All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time.Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version.Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action.

Lacey Chabert, still very young in this movie, is a great Penny. Matt Leblanc does a good job in an action role as well. The rest of the case gets the job done.

While it's not the masterpiece of the century, it's definitely worth seeing and is a lot of fun.Now, like many films from that second half of the 90s, Lost in Space suffers from the poor aging of those early CGI special effects. But it shares this issue with many far bigger films, including the Mummy 2 (with its horrible Scorpion King rendering), Air Force One with its awful plane crash rendering or even Star Wars Episode 1 with, well... Jar Jar Binks.But with Lost in Space this problem is largely limited to the poorly done pet creature (Blarg), which looks extremely fake, but otherwise the special effects are impressive even over two decades later, including the explosions, space scenes, the spiders and Dr. Smith's final form.One of the sheer highlights of the film comes from the cast. They pulled in some great names, including William Hurt as John Robinson, Mimi Rodgers as his wife Maureen, Matt Leblanc as Joey Tribbi... I mean, Major West, and of course Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith. Additionally, Jared Harris has one of his first big film roles and pulls off an older Will Robinson superbly well. This was long before he became a household name and he showcases the talent that would propel him to the top.The cast works well together and makes this film both compelling and amusing. It's also an amusing side note that Matt Leblanc did this role when he was at the height of Friends' popularity, and he basically plays the role of Joey... in space. If you hate Friends you'll hate it, but if you're a Friends fan this is an added little bonus.Definitely worth giving a chance, as this is a worthy addition to the Lost in Space world and bridges the gap between the classic 60s series and the new Netflix reboot nicely.",Lost in Space

I know the movie isn't evil or mean-spirited, but does that mean it has to be so damn awful?  I tried to find something in the movie that wasn't a cliche; I failed.  The cast turns in nearly uniformly wooden line readings as they trot through the paces of the plot.  Not making any sense?  Well hell, says the movie, just throw in some loud sound effects, lousy computer graphics, a couple of jokey one-liners that would be below the cheesiest nightclub comic and goose up the action regardless of how improbable it becomes.

You really can't compare fairly anything modern with the 60's, we all know this, but both shows for their times did a great job with the warp speed scenes, the spiders were scary & believable, and the bubble effect was quite good along with the great sets. The ""Bloop"" character was more believable as an alien than that ridiculous monkey from the original series, and the kid played a pretty good Will Robinson, and it was really cool to see some of the original actors with cameos in this film, should have had more parts, but they were showcased at least. And i did like Gary Oldman, as always, as Dr. Smith, he was cunning, subtle & showed plenty of cowardice when he needed to. What is WRONG with this movie: First of all, two words: William Hurt. Not saying he is a bad actor, but he was dreadful in this one, although he looked good, he also looked like an amateur in his first B-movie. But that is just for starters, the whole ""family"" concept seemed scrapped from the original series, which was one with strength & resolve, turned into a dis-functional, confused & completely abandoned & self-focused plot to the point where the movie itself lost it's sense of adventure. The Robot, of course the original B-9 from the series is LOVED & none other can take it's place. The relationship between it & Will Robinson was not nearly as tight. And speaking of Will Robinson, WHY was Billy Mumy not in this film?? He should have played the part of the grown-up Will Robinson, and nothing in my mind doubts that he wanted to.

Family is first and foremost in this flick. The Robot is great, William Hurt's John Robinson is 'supposed' to be bland - just like Guy Williams played him on TV!, Matt LeBlanc is EXCELLENT as Major West and captures that same 'young pilot' aura, Gary Oldman is great as always, Mimi Rogers is strong and yummy. The new 'Bloop' is a bit annoying and unnecessary. Special effects are top-notch as is the sound, especially in 5.1 Dolby, a real treat.

But look at this from a comedy point of view, base it on pure entertainment value, and you've got an OK film. The cast which includes William Hurt and Matt Le Blanc (better known as Joey from ""Friends) do a pretty good job considering the script and are actually quite entertaining. Director Steven Hopkins creates a sci-fi world which is so tacky and bizarre that it's actually pretty interesting, the skin tight grey suits are so cringing that you can't help but laugh, and Gary Oldman is so wonderfully over the top as the evil Dr. Zachary Smith that it becomes increasingly hard to believe that it wasn't intended as a comedy performance This definitely isn't a great sci-fi film nor does it live up to the original series. But maybe it's not trying to, this film if you look at it in the right light is an incredibly funny, fun film that kids will most likely love.

Also, there are still too many unanswered questions, e.g. why was the second Jupiter-2 (from the future) located at a different position as the other Jupiter-2 (from the present), if the only thing which separated the two is TIME?

283,Im_Afraid_So,A rare Sci-Fi family movie...,9,1 June 2007,"First of all, I would like to address fans of the TV show who hate this film. I am always shocked how many people feel that this film was ""unfaithful"" to the original series. I would invite you to go back and watch the very early episodes of the series, before it became a camped-up disaster (admit it!), and see how similar the two are.The 1998 film is often a straight remake of the original, only, frankly, much better.The idea of a film about a single family trying to survive and function by itself when they are all alone in outer space is loaded with potential, and I think this film did as much as could be expected in what was planned to be a three-movie series.There's a lot to like in this movie--first of all, it's a science fiction movie that the whole family can actually enjoy, not just the twenty-year-old son living in the basement. The special effects were very impressive for the day and some of them hold up very well. There's a kick-ass end credit sequence (how often do I get to say that?) featuring a new version of the classic Lost in Space theme song. There's some exciting action scenes, good performances by the adult leads, cool production design, some genuinely touching moments, and two not-overly-cute performances by a child actors, which is extremely rare. Penny is actually something resembling a real character this time around. Also, the fact that the queenish, goofy Dr. Smith actually becomes a threatening and very creepy villain by the end of the film is no small feat.The story is sometimes episodic, but all comes together very well. Small details become important plot points later in the film in surprising ways.Now, there are some down sides. The script is by Akiva Goldsman, best known for his Oscar-winning screenplay for A Beautiful Mind. However, comic book fans will always remember him as a boogey-man who concoted the script for Joel Schumacher's infamous film Batman and Robin. This script is somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. Although it is very clever at times and manages to incorporate favorite bits from the series, some of the dialogue will definitely remind the viewer of Arnold Schwartzennager's infamous Ice puns from Batman and Robin and will definitely make the eyes roll. Matt Leblanc is stuck with most of this. Akiva Goldsman has always written terrible, shameless ""buzz"" dialogue, quips where a character tries to say something clever and cool. It's painful at times. Gary Oldman also has a few of his own, in which he actually has to refer to himself as evil. Seriously, what villain actually knows that they are evil? Despite some cliché moments, which can easily be forgiven by young members of the audience (a large chunk), Lost in Space is an above-average adventure movie. It's exciting, occasionally funny, and has likable characters. I only wish the sequel materialized, I think it only could have gotten better.",Lost in Space

Also not to mention the incredibly bad acting and cliche lines.Maybe I should give it some credit... this terrible film did make me laugh (although that was not its intention).  Zero thumbs up!",Lost in Space
285,troussos,"Very good cast and effects. Plot started well, then disintegrated.",9,12 December 2007,"The casting was very good. Effects were appropriate and tasteful. The plot started strong then disintegrated during the last 1/4 of movie.Relationship between father and son should have remained faithful to original series for continuity and positive role model.Very much looked forward to a sequel with the same cast. Unfortunately, it never happened. Too bad.Matt LeBlanc was especially well suited for the character of Major Don West. A much stronger role than his comedic persona. Matt could easily fill the science fiction duties occupied by the likes of Scott Bacula. I would definitely like to see Matt in a similar science fiction/action adventure role.Other than the poor father-son relationship, original Lost In Space creator, Irwin Allen, would most likely have approved of this project.",Lost in Space
286,cmfurner-1,Much like a Star Trek movie...,9,11 March 2009,I don't why this movie got such bad reviews. I guess it's because most people compare it to the original TV series. I think if this movie had a different name it would have done better. The movie's plot plays much like a Star Trek movie. IF you're not a fan of sci-fi or Star Trek then you probably won't like it. If you try to compare it to the original series you probably won't like it but if you let the movie stand on it's own merits you'll probably like it. I was not a fan of the original series and I just enjoyed the movie for what it was: a good action flick. While maybe not a top 100 of all time movie it is worth a watch if you give it a chance...,Lost in Space
287,thehawk1942,Worst sci-fi movie I've ever seen,2,18 November 2018,"The acting was sub par and the graphics were so horrible it was impossible to believe in anything that was happening. The story line wasn't bad, but the screen writing and dialogue were not great. Plus some of the science is a bit questionable, if not impossible. The fly through the planet bit - goes against the laws of physics. But if the acting, story line and graphics were better it would have been easier to ignore the bad science. Movies made 10-20 years before this were way better. The original unedited star wars, ET had way better graphics. This had to have been very low budget. I was very disappointed in this movie, I was expecting better.",Lost in Space
288,griecor,It was a good movie to enjoy with the family,10,21 December 2004,"I just want tell that I feel sorry for those who think they know and know nothing. My background is just science fiction and that is why I became an Aerospace Engineer; even thought, we are full hotshot who are worth nothing in AE. Although, the movie doesn't give up much sense from the original, it has its own heart. Finally, all the actors were great by putting their own personality to the character; something that was not allow in the original. I am so sad to see that everyone wants to be a critic of something that is not your thing in the first place. Some people like action movies, others likes drama, and some sci-fi movie, like me. However, every sci-fi has its own soul. If you a hardcore Star trek fan it would be difficult to talk about Lost in Space, a completely different storyline from ST. As for myself, I love any sci-fi (star-wars I-II-IV-V-VI, star trek, ultra-man, ultra-seven, x-men, superman, small ville, batman, battle-star galactic 1978, battle-star galactic 1980, battle-star galactic 2003, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, ST:DS9, ST:Voyager, ST:TNG, ST:Enterprise, Space above and Beyond, Space 1999, UFO, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and so many other, of course LOST IN SPACE) that is why I became an AE. It is a shame than some people are so closed mind to what they think that they can not see to the distant....",Lost in Space
289,rtreadway,Sequel?,8,30 January 2005,"As a fan to the original I 've found this to be very good, I'm hoping for a sequel. The plot was fine, I remember Dr. Smith sabotaging the Jupiter II crew and this movie matches it perfectly. Even Dr. Smith character play by Gary Oldman was perfect in preserving the original Dr. Smith. Thumbs up, Jack Johnson played Will Robinson Perfectly if not better and I like the Idea that the character Judy is a Doctor. (Smart), reflecting today women. That overall cast chemistry worked well. I do have one complaint I like the new Robot in preserving the original icon of the robot was cool but I like the new one. Again Thumbs up and remember it's just my opinion . . .",Lost in Space
290,joestebbins,Universal appeal.,10,16 February 2014,"This movie is absolutely science fiction excellence. The plot was excellent, substance from start to finish. The acting utterly flawless, delivered by a cast recognizable to even the most casual of movie viewers, making the characters indelible to even my discerning perceptions. The cinematography was brilliant, adding even more depth and vitality with cutting edge technique. Finally the special effects were stellar, pulling all the elements together like an inescapable gravitational pull of an infinitely massive movie. This will remain high in the list of all movies seen for a long time to come. This movie should be followed by a continuous stream of sequels.",Lost in Space
291,beaulieu-4,"Good movie, nice effects but mostly nice work on stuff from '60s series",9,3 April 2005,"I've always been a big fan of sci-fi, and as a 7 years old, that series fascinated me. But you know, robots and spaceships of the '60s are now pretty boring. So, I was amazed on how, on that movie, they were able to bring back that old stuff, and mix it intelligently with new cool stuff. They have such a cool robot on the movie, and I didn't see how they could bring back the old one and makes it look right in the movie. But they did. And even about the notion of being ""lost in space"". Their jump drive makes it plausible to get lost. I find that the storyline was inventive, special effects were good, acting was good. I cannot see why this movie wasn't a big hit. Maybe a lack in advertisement.",Lost in Space
292,zebenne,Is it a 10? No. Is it a 5? Or less? Hell no!,8,8 January 2021,"I loved it when it came out. Some scenes are a bit cheesy. But some scenes are my absolute favorites in all of moviedom. When Maureen interrupts Don and John's fight... doesn't get any better than that! The effects are dated... but for the time, plenty good. The interplay with many of the characters is fun and evolving. It's a solid 7 for me at least. And there are evenings where only Lost in Space will do. As Matt Le Blanc's Don said, ""Well, if there's no time for fun, what are we saving the planet for?"" Seriously. The planet needs a bit more fun. And Lost in Space provides it.",Lost in Space
293,toonice4u10,Not too bad,7,16 August 2006,"Wasn't the best movie, but I quite enjoyed it. The effects were OK, and the acting was better than average. I thought Matt LeBlanc did a good job as Major West, so not like his other alter-ego ""joey"" I liked the movie because it was different. It was a remake of a television series and they director, writers, etc tried not going to far from what the series was based on. the family flies to space, the trip gets misdirected, they get lost, they have to find their way home. If I'm not mistaken, the voice of the robot sounded like the same one from the series, unless I'm hearing things.It would be nice if humanity could work on something like that now, so in the future we're not scrambling around trying to find another planet with sufficient resources to sustain life.",Lost in Space
294,andrewnossol,Possibly The Worst Movie EVER!,1,4 September 2016,"I am a huge fan of the original series but I'm afraid, like most remakes, this just sucks. The movie seems to have nearly nothing in common with the original series apart from the characters names and some original personalities. The casting directors did not even attempt to cast people who looked like the original cast. This movie is ultra modern and features crappy CGI effects as well as terrible acting. In my opinion this movie, and other remakes of classic TV shows, should be illegal! Overall I think this movie was just a total waste of time and money and should be never seen again. I think Irwin Allen would have been ashamed of it.",Lost in Space
295,andyfrueh,I pretty much disagree,7,25 April 2007,"This franchise has always ""lurked in the shadows"" of Star Trek, even when it originally aired on TV. As not everyone is into Star Trek, you can imagine Lost In Space would be treated like a sci-fi stepchild.It's clear a lot of folks don't ""get it."" Lost in Space was IRWIN ALLEN, folks. I mean come ON...the man who was notorious for children's fare of questionable scientific truthfulness. You can NOT watch this movie expecting Starship Troopers, Alien, or any of a number of gritty serious sci-fi films.Of COURSE it's going to have cliché...it's based on a show that was basically ""Leave it to Beaver in Space!"" What's interesting is, having recently made my own ""cut"" of this movie (removing all traces of the idiocy that is the ""Blarp"" alien) and then going back to the original 4 TV episodes, you see how much this movie was meant to play homage to the show's earlier episodes.AND it does so brilliantly, right down to the ""updated"" Robot being recreated by Will in a form nearer that of the original show, the swirling light on the bottom of the ship, and the mention of ""the chariot"" being scrap. I mean heck, the ending title re-used the tune of later seasons of the show.This movie wasn't made to introduce a new audience to Lost in Space. It was meant for the fans.If you don't like escapist schlock, you'll hate it. But if you like a bit of flash with your mind-numbing entertainment, this fits the bill.My only beef? The Robot paradox...Will's in the process of rebuilding the robot on the Jupiter 2, then the rebuilt model from the future boards the ship. Doesn't that mean there are TWO robots now on the ship? ;-)",Lost in Space
296,deilburn,One of the best films I saw being a child.,10,3 August 2017,"A fact that this film is one of those which provided me through my early childhood makes me difficult to criticize it. Anyway I want to tell that this is something which may suite anybody from your child to your grandma. This film has a decent plot, good graphic effects and a very well casting. I'm sure that Hopkins wanted to make a film for everybody, the whole family. I guess he succeeded. I watched it first time on TV in early 00-th and was totally blown away. Today a can say that there is nothing too special in this movie, but it looks just nice. Hope you will enjoy.",Lost in Space
297,enchristi,Lost in Space,2,16 June 2007,"This movie will definitely not win any awards; HOWEVER, as someone who remembers watching the original TV series, it was great fun to hear the original voice of the robot. DANGER WILL ROBINSON! It is one of those films you can watch on a lazy afternoon when you have only half a brain to devote to a movie. One of it's positive points is that it is family friendly and it tries to portray both intelligent children/teens AND intelligent adults. Both generations seem to learn from one another. It might have been a little more fun (more like the TV series) if Dr. Smith would have been a little less evil and a little more ridiculous. Course, I guess that Gary Oldman wouldn't have quite fit the part then. Oh, well! Overall, it is only a so-so film, but again, it does provide a fun reminder of the original campy show from my childhood.",Lost in Space
298,scottxcj,Lost in Space - underrated,10,15 April 2006,"I believe the 1998 Lost in Space remake is an incredibly underrated film and that the quality of this fun, visually impressive, hi-concept picture is grossly overlooked due to the uninspired negative reviews by few critics, that have had their opinions followed by countless sheep-like reviewers, afraid to cast their own opinion of this project and enjoy it for themselves. For a picture that went into production in 1997, 2 years before Episode 1 (The Phantom Menace) was released, its special effects still hold up to estimation to todays standard, and features model work that is far superior to half of the abysmal CGI attempts since the millennium. The production quality in terms of the films sets, costume dept, soundtrack etc are all high quality, with a strong cast helming an innocent and fun storyline. Considering the utilisation of young actors and a child friendly rating, the film is not half as corny in terms of dialogue/performance than countless other pictures I could name that appear to hold more credibility. I urge people to rewatch and reevaluate this picture for what it is, a hi-concept, big budget, sci-fi, action/adventure picture for any age group to enjoy, and for it to be done with out it being sat through from the beginning with the negative preconception that this is a worthless piece of film. I argue that its more than worth your viewing time.",Lost in Space
299,bmcguinness-54321,"For a ""Lost in Space"" story it's pretty good",6,20 April 2018,"Irwin Allen is known for creating schlocky science fiction series with bad science and poor writing. Remember, this is the man who didn't even know that ice floats in water. So I never went to the theater to see this film. But when I did finally see it on cable, I was pleasantly surprised. The effects were decent, aside from the idiotic, cartoonish alien Blarp. I like that the creators of the film felt free to go off in interesting new directions with the designs. The new robot was appealing (and far more effectively menacing during his rampage than the original B-9). Don West's space armor was cool. The ships looked good.The story was interesting. The time travel part was a bit hokey, but otherwise the plot wasn't bad. The basic idea of setting up jump gates for future colonists to use made more sense than having the Robinsons colonize a planet all by themselves. The plot device used to get the party lost in space was more plausible than an unexpected meteoroid swarm. Dr. Smith was an actual villain, not the idiotic sap that Jonathan Harris portrayed. (Gary Oldman's ""oh, my aching back"" line was an amusing touch, though.) Although Akiva Goldsman is not known for being a great writer -- after all, he cowrote the abysmal pilot for Star Trek Discovery -- he did reasonably well with this story. Imagine what the film could have been if, say, Stephen Baxter or Alastair Reynolds had written it!Lost in Space (1998) is not on a par with 2001 or Babylon 5 by a long shot. Nor should one expect it to be. But it is considerably better than the original television series. Given the source material they had to work with, the film's creators did a decent job of putting together an entertaining film. So give credit where credit is due.",Lost in Space
