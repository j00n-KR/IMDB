0,MartinHafer,Far from perfect but oh so entertaining,8,25 July 2006,"This is a post-""Spaghetti Western"" Clint Eastwood Western. Because it is not one of these earlier films, the music (one of the best aspects of the films) isn't nearly as good and Eastwood doesn't wear the duds he wore in his three ""spaghetti"" films (i.e., Westerns made in Italy). However, it's still a dandy film--however, it is VERY important to understand this is NOT a film for kids!!! Apart from all the extreme violence, the language is pretty raw and there is a rape scene early in the film. This rape is very problematic, too, as with heightened awareness of sexual abuse, the rape was not handled well in the film--showing an old fashioned ""she wanted it"" view of rape.The film begins with Eastwood coming into a very unfriendly town and killing three stupid thugs that try to pick a fight. The town is excited to see his skills with a gun and magnanimously ignore his raping a woman shortly after the shooting. While the lady was very nasty and I think Eastwood's character with no name might have been provoked enough to slap her,....he raped her!? The town's acceptance of this is just one of many indications that they are a town not worth saving. But, because they give Eastwood carte blanche to do ANYTHING he feels is necessary, he agrees to protect the citizens. Eastwood takes full advantage of this carte blanche and does him darnedest to upset the townsfolk--giving away liquor, making a malevolent midget the new sheriff AND mayor, and forcing the town to be painted red.Why all this occurs and the despicable way the townspeople have behaved and will behave are a treat to see. I don't really want to discuss the reasons further, as it would spoil the film. However, exactly WHO Eastwood was and WHAT his motivation is are left intentionally vague. At the end of the film, the midget (Billy Curtis) asks him who is is,...and Eastwood tells him ""you know"". Really?! I have some ideas, but this is far from a certainly. This left the film with a mystical and strange quality I actually liked. In many ways, it was an interesting and bizarre take on the films HIGH NOON and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK--two other films I strongly recommend.",High Plains Drifter
1,bkoganbing,"Lago, a town with many secrets",8,13 August 2016,"One of the great western plots is the outsider stranger who comes to a town and one way or another rids it of its bad elements. A cliché best typified by Shane. In High Plains Drifter we have the town of Lago which sure doesn't look like much. A mysterious stranger comes to town played by Clint Eastwood and he's certainly up for the role of town savior. But as the film unfolds is Lago a town worth saving?The funny thing is that Eastwood himself did a variation on the plot of Shane in Pale Rider. He's as noble there as Alan Ladd was in Shane. But in High Plains Drifter his gunfighter skills are almost superhuman. And he's far from noble. His brooding presence frightens the town people but he might be their savior so like it or not, they put up with it though they don't like it.In fact the town's leading citizens are really a scurvy lot and the town has a lot of secrets. As you watch High Plains Drifter you wonder if the crowd is worth saving.It all works out the same as it does for Shane, but with one supernatural twist. In fact there's not another Clint Eastwood movie let alone western film where the supernatural comes in. It truly is a star vehicle for Eastwood, most of the supporting cast don't have enough to work with to create memorable characters. An exception is Barry Curtis, a midget who Eastwood elevates to prime importance and is really the only true friend the High Plains Drifter has.In fact High Plains Drifter has a ride into the sunset like no other.",High Plains Drifter
2,Leofwine_draca,"It may not be Eastwood's best western, but it's a mean and moody piece of film-making",8,30 July 2016,"HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is the first western that Clint Eastwood starred in that he also directed himself. While he gives a typically great performance as the titular character, the real surprise here comes from his matured, stylish direction that would have you thinking he'd been making these films for twenty years beforehand. This is an eerie western, laced through with violent flashbacks and an increasingly hellish atmosphere as it tells the story of corrupt townsfolk who watched a man die at the hands of three violent outlaws.It's one of those films where my attention was gripped for every moment. Eastwood doesn't play a likable character at all - he starts off by raping a woman - but the reason for that gradually becomes clear as the film progresses. It hardly exonerates him, but at least there's some kind of twisted motive there. The supporting cast of ne'er-do-wells is fine, although nobody gives a stand-out performance (apart from Billy Curtis as the kooky, lovable dwarf, Mordecai). Geoffrey Lewis pops up in an early role as one of the bad guys, and the underrated Mitchell Ryan - Burke from DARK SHADOWS - plays a head townsman.The direction is superlative and the script avoids the typical clichés for the most part. I paid particular attention to the soundtrack, which combines eerie, dramatic effects with excellent music. The ending is one of those ones that actually exceeds audience expectations in terms of the dramatic tension, excitement, and plain good ol' fashioned filmmaking it excels in. This may not be Eastwood's best, but it sure as heck is up there with the best of them, and the touches of ambiguity make it all the better.",High Plains Drifter
3,SnoopyStyle,The Man With No Name,8,7 September 2013,"Clint Eastwood is the man with no name. He's a gunfighter stranger who has come to Lago. The townfolks hire him to create a militia to defend the town from three outlaws who are on their way. He's given free rein over the town, and starts making strange demands. As the town is forced to supply him at his whims, discontent spreads.Is he defending the town? Or is he tearing the town apart? Clint Eastwood is playing the anti-hero. His motives are muddy. He rapes a woman. He is a rough man. There's a dark secret that the townfolks are hiding about the previous sheriff. Does the man with no name have any relationship with that? It's an iconic role not only for Clint, but for American Cinema. His murky motivation is a sign of times in an era of discontent.",High Plains Drifter
4,claudio_carvalho,An Avenger Angel Looking for Revenge,8,18 December 2003,"In the coastal town of Lago, a drifter (Clint Eastwood) arrives and is bullied by three ""bad guys"". He kills them and soon he is invited by the locals to protect the city against three outlaws that would leave a nearby prison in a couple of days. One year ago, these criminals killed Marshal Jim Duncan using whips. The marshal asked for help and the coward towners did not help him. The killers were sent to jail and promised to come back to burn the city when they leave the jail. The citizens offer anything the stranger want ""free of charge"" for the protection against the rage of the criminals. Who might be the stranger with no name?""High Plains Drifter"" is a great movie about revenge. The viewer never knows whether the ""stranger with no name"" is a brother or a friend of Marshal Jim Duncan, or whether he is the avenger angel of Jim Duncan himself looking for revenge. In the last scene, when Mordecai asks for the name of the stranger while carving the gravestone of Jin Duncanin the cemetery telling that he did not know his name, the drifter responds that Mordecai does know his name. In the gravestone is written ""Marshall Jim Duncan - Rest in Peace"". Fans of western movies will not be disappointed with this film, no matter whether he is a cowboy or a supernatural character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Estranho sem Nome"" (""The Stranger without a Name"")Note: On 01 Sep 2020, I saw this film again.",High Plains Drifter
5,classicsoncall,"""Well it's what people know about themselves inside that makes 'em afraid.""",10,3 January 2007,"I'm perfectly willing to allow Clint Eastwood his pronouncement of ambiguity regarding the character of 'The Stranger', and have read with interest the many opinions offered in the reviews and threads on this site. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times over the years, but today it was with the express intent of crystallizing my opinion. As I've felt all along, the character of The Stranger is indeed a mortal man, the brother of the slain town marshal Jim Duncan, and I'll get into that in a minute.Let's keep in mind that Eastwood himself has had quite some time to reflect on his direction and portrayal in the film, and the subject of a ghostly apparition had time to take hold of viewer consciousness. The film itself has added to the controversy, at least twice via statements made by hotel owner Lewis Belding (Ted Hartley). The first time occurs right after he supervises the evacuation of his hotel, remarking disparagingly to the Preacher (Robert Donner) - ""...they're emptyin' my whole hotel, throwing out paying guests right into the street just to make room for our new guardian angel"". Later, when addressing Lago's citizens at a town meeting right after the dinner scene with The Stranger and Callie - ""...couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago"". So right there you have the seeds planted for both an avenging angel and a demon bent on revenge.There IS a real mystery to the film, but it's not the identity of 'The Stranger'. To fully understand, it's important to view the movie in it's unedited form via tape or DVD. Watching ""High Plains Drifter"" on TV, even a cable channel leaves too much out, particularly in the way of dialog, and especially regarding the character of Callie (Marianna Hill) and her relationship to the people in the town.The movie offers two flashback scenes, the first by 'The Stranger' only about twenty minutes into the story, the second by Mordecai (Billy Curtis), again shortly after the evacuation of the hotel guests. In both flashbacks, one is able to recognize every citizen of Lago that we already know by name, EXCEPT ONE. About midway in each scene, a character is shown entering from, and then retreating back into the shadows, with half of a bearded face visible. It's the face of The Stranger. The reason Eastwood's character can recall with clarity what occurred on the night Marshal Duncan was killed is because he was there. The mystery then becomes why he was powerless at the time to intervene on his brother's behalf. Presumably he wasn't a citizen of Lago, or he would be recognized, so there must have been another reason for him to be there. Visiting his brother, certainly, but for reasons unknown and unexplored, 'The Stranger' did not become involved at the time of his brother's death.The one person who had an inkling to The Strangers' identity I feel, was Sarah Belding, making reference to the dead marshal in an unmarked grave. But The Stranger wasn't biting, he intended to remain anonymous, a position he affirmed when he first checked into Belding's hotel and didn't register. Sure he could have used a phony name, but then some of the mystique he was attempting to establish would have been compromised.I'm quite intrigued reading some of the threads maintaining certainty regarding The Stranger being a 'spirit' citing reactions the character has, as if one could actually know how a spirit would go about his business. But since we're playing that game, I'd offer two reasons why he couldn't be a spirit or a demon. On the ride into town, The Stranger's reflection is shown on one of the store front windows as he goes past. Then in the first bar scene, The Stranger's arm casts a shadow on the wall as he takes his beer. Granted, most of my spirit and demon lore has come from other movies and popular literature, but I believe that both of those occurrences aren't possible with beings from the other side. What REALLY intrigues me now is if Eastwood was clever enough to consciously plant those things in the film to keep everyone and his brother (no pun there) guessing. Oh, and one last thing - if The Stranger really WAS a ghost, then who's ghost was the horse he rode in on?When I first entered a rating for this film on IMDb, I gave it a strong '8' as one of the upper echelon film Westerns, right up there with ""High Noon"", ""Shane"", and Eastwood's own ""Unforgiven"". However now, after having so much fun watching and re-watching the movie, and reading some of the great discussion on this site, that has to warrant at least two bonus points, I'm re-establishing my rating as a '10'.One last thing - if you're interested in hearing Clint Eastwood himself describe who/what the character of The Stranger represents, head over to his website at http://www.clinteastwood.net/welcome2.htmlFollow the links to the movie, and then click on the audio icon for ""High Plains Drifter"".",High Plains Drifter
6,gavin6942,"Clint Eastwood Directs Himself, Presents a Dark Old West",7,7 January 2011,"This film is pretty enjoyable, especially if you enjoy Clint Eastwood, westerns, Clint Eastwood westerns, or Eastwood's directing (this is a very early example of that which would pay off for him much later). The story, which takes a while to come together, is pretty decent once you get it.There are certainly plenty of complaints you could raise. The rape aspect is completely unjustified. John Wayne criticized the film's violence and ultimately never worked with Eastwood because of it. The plot is not as clear as it could be. But I think as much as these may be marks against the film, there are not strong enough to take away from the film's legacy.I will be the first to admit I am not a huge fan of westerns, and aside from a handful just do not really get into them. I liked this film. I would say it is not Eastwood's best, as a director or actor. It's not the best western I ever saw, and probably not even top ten. But I would recommend you see it if this is your cup of tea.",High Plains Drifter
7,lee_eisenberg,Dirty Harry meets Marion Wormer meets one of the Munchkins,5,11 July 2017,"After a few years on ""Rawhide"", Clint Eastwood got internationally famous with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. I understand that a couple of movies in the US tried to unsuccessfully impersonate the spaghetti westerns. It was understandable that Clint, having made his directorial debut with ""Play Misty for Me"", would decide to direct his own western. The result was ""High Plains Drifter"".The movie itself is middling. Clint's nameless character (The Man with No Name yet again) is sort of a cross between an angel and a devil, doling out justice in a corrupt town. However, much of the movie comes across as silly, although that might have been the intention. Nevertheless, the westerns from this era that I recommend are Arthur Penn's ""Little Big Man"" and Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"".The rest of the cast includes Verna Bloom (Mrs. Wormer in ""Animal House"") and Billy Curtis (one of the munchkins in ""The Wizard of Oz"").",High Plains Drifter
8,jboothmillard,High Plains Drifter,7,12 April 2008,"The was the second film directed by actor Clint Eastwood (Play Misty for Me, Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, The Mule), also the first in his most recognised genre he directed, I had heard positive things about it, so I looked forward to watching it. Basically, an unnamed Stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides out of the desert into the isolated mining town of Lago in Inyo County, California in the American Old West. After being taunted by three men from the saloon, they challenge him, and he kills them with little effort. Local belle Callie Travers (Marianna Hill), wanting his company, deliberately bumps into him in the street, she proceeds to loudly insult him. He drags her into the livery stable and rapes her, she struggles at first but gives in. That night, in his hotel room, the Stranger dreams of a man being brutally whipped. This is a flashback of federal marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) who was whipped to death in front of the hotel by outlaws Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis) and the Carlin brothers, Dan (Dan Vadis) and Cole (Anthony James). The next day, Sheriff Sam Shaw (Walter Barnes) approaches the Stranger and offers him the job previously held by the men he killed: defending the town from Bridges and the Carlins, who are due to be released from jail. The Stranger declines, but in desperation, Shaw offers him anything he wants in return. The Stranger learns the townspeople were responsible for Duncan's murder; they hired the outlaws to kill him, they then double-crossed the hired murderers and turned them in. Upon learning this, the Stranger accepts the job and takes full advantage of the deal. He appoints barbershop employee Mordecai (Billy Curtis) as sheriff and mayor, and provides an Indian and his children with supplies at the shopkeeper's expense. Despite the objections hotel owner Lewis Belding (Ted Hartley) and his wife Sarah (Verna Bloom), the Stranger orders the hotel owner and his guests to vacate the premises, leaving him its sole occupant. Callie and some of the resentful townsmen conspire to do away with the Stranger. After she has sex with the Stranger, she sneaks out, and some of the townspeople go after the Stranger. He thwarts them however, sneaking out himself and blowing up the room with a stick of dynamite while they are beating a dummy in the bed, most of the hotel is wrecked as well. He drags Sarah, kicking and screaming, into her bedroom and they sleep together. The next morning, while discussing the imprisoned murderers, Sarah tells the Stranger that Duncan is buried in an unmarked grave outside of town. The Stranger instructs the townspeople in defensive tactics, but they lack the competence for the job. He also orders that every building in town be painted blood red. Then, without explanation, he mounts his horse and rides out of town, pausing to paint the word ""Hell"" to replace ""Lago"" on the town sign. Meanwhile, Bridges and the Carlins have been released from prison and are on their way to Lago. The Stranger harasses them with dynamite and firing his rifle, leaving them to question the identity of their attacker. When the Stranger returns to Lago, the entire town painted red, townsmen are armed with rifles on the rooftops, picnic tables are laden with food and drink, and a big ""WELCOME HOME BOYS"" banner is overhead. The Stranger mounts his horse and rides away again, and the gang arrive, easily overcoming the inept resistance of the townspeople. By nightfall, the town is in flames, and the terrified citizens are huddled in the saloon with the gang, who taunt them. Cole Carlin, while standing by the entrance to the saloon, is caught by a whip around the throat, dragged outside and he is whipped to death. Dan Carlin is then found dead also, hanging from another whip. As Bridges investigates, the Stranger appears, beats Bridges to the draw, and kills him. On his way out of town the next morning, the Stranger stops as Mordecai is placing a new grave marker. As he rides past a bewildered Mordecai, who mentions never knowing his name, the writing on the new grave marker is revealed: Marshal Jim Duncan - Rest in Peace. Also starring Liar Liar's Mitchell Ryan as Dave Drake, The A-Team's Jack Ging as Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as Mayor Jason Hobart, The Muppet Movie's Scott Walker as Bill Borders, Paul Brinegar as Lutie Naylor, Richard Bull as Asa Goodwin, Robert Donner as Preacher, John Hillerman as Bootmaker and William O'Connell as Barber. You could argue Eastwood is playing the ""Man with No Name"", as always, with his steely eyes and gravelly voice he is the perfect mysterious cowboy. Eastwood obviously pays homage to Sergio Leone, a simple story of an unknown gunslinger hired to go against a group of bandits, there is good period detail, and enough violence and fights to keep the pace going, an interesting western. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",High Plains Drifter
9,Woodyanders,Clint Eastwood's strangest and most startling Western ever,9,10 April 2008,"The lethal and mysterious the Stranger (Clint Eastwood in peak steely and formidable form) arrives in the seedy and lawless coastal community of Lago. The cowardly citizens hire the Stranger to protect them from a trio of dangerous criminals who've just been released from prison. The Stranger proceeds to turn the place upside down: he rapes fiery harlot Callie Travers (the gorgeous Marianna Hill), makes persecuted midget Mordecai (a marvelous performance by Billy Curtis) both sheriff and mayor, repaints the burg red, and renames it Hell. Director Eastwood, adapting an intriguingly cryptic script by Oscar-winning screenwriter Ernest Tidyman (who previously penned ""Shaft"" and ""The French Connection""), crafts an arrestingly stark, dark and brutal nihilistic stunner that turns standard Western conventions completely on their ear: the beleaguered townspeople are all contemptible weaklings, the outlaws actually have a valid beef against the hamlet, and the Stranger makes for a genuinely scary, ruthless and vicious anti-heroic bastard of an avenging angel of death. Moreover, the handsome cinematography by Bruce Surtees, the odd, eerie, quasi-supernatural Gothic horror-Western tone, the unsparingly harsh amoral sensibility, Dee Barton's spooky score, a sharp streak of wickedly deadpan pitch-black humor, the laconic dialogue, and several jolting outbursts of savage violence all add up to one remarkably bizarre and haunting one-of-a-kind doozy. The bang-up acting from a terrific cast of familiar faces rates as another substantial asset: Verna Bloom as the disapproving Sarah Belding, Mitchell Ryan as crooked sycophantic mining company boss Dave Drake, Jack Ging as sniveling hotelier Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as the ineffectual Mayor Jason Hobart, Walter Barnes as the folksy Sheriff Sam Shaw, Robert Donner as a hypocritical preacher, and Geoffrey Lewis, Scott Walker, and Anthony James as the three mangy no-count outlaws. A real gritty gem.",High Plains Drifter
10,Tweekums,... and Hell followed with him.,8,2 December 2008,"This Clint Eastwood western is a lot of fun although not really suitable for younger viewers as there are some fairly violent scenes including a rape and a flash back which shows somebody being whipped to death.The film opens with a lone horseman coming out of the desert and entering the town of Lago. After a drink in the saloon he pops into the barbers for a shave where he is interrupted by three locals spoiling for a fight. Clint quickly dispatches them before they can get off a shot. It turns out that these three had been hired to protect the town from three murderers who had killed the town marshal, this crime the town covered up but to get rid of them they framed them for a robbery. They swore revenge on the town and are due to be released from prison the next day.The townspeople approach the nameless gunman, played by Clint, to help then protect the town, he isn't interested until they say he can have anything he wants if he helps. He soon takes advantage of the offer getting free items from just about every shop in town and making the local midget both the sheriff and the mayor. The more he takes the more the townsfolk start to argue amongst themselves, some even make the mistake of trying to kill him. By the time the three murders arrive the gunman has literally painted the town red and renamed it Hell.In many ways this is similar to his later film ""Pale Rider"", in both it is strongly suggested that the protagonist is an avenging ghost and he even rides a similarly coloured horse. The acting in the film is solid and includes many people who where regularly in Clint Eastwood's films of the time. As well as the action the film is memorable for the haunting music. This is one of my favourite westerns, I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.",High Plains Drifter
11,ma-cortes,Clint Eastwood vehicle playing his usual character as avenger gunslinger,7,30 July 2009,"This violent Western is set on Northern outdoors and the star is a mysterious revenger, ¨a man without name¨ , who comes to the aid of embattled citizens. It deals about a gunfighter (Clint Eastwood) arriving a little town called Lago that has the usual shops and buildings, as General merchandise, Livery stable, Hardware, Barber shop, Saloon , Hotel and of course the Church. The drifter donning his six-guns is contracted by townspeople to protect them from a trio of avenge-seeking outlaws(Geoffrey Lewis, Dan Vadis, Anthony James)who have justly released from jail. But the villagers wind up painting the little town and calling it : ¨Hell¨.Well crafted Western with interesting screenplay by Ernest Tidyman. Although atmospheric , it's also downbeat and sometimes just downright nasty. The story is almost terrific as the drifter comes to strange frontier town just in time to reckoning villagers and bandits. This stirring picture contains a powerful examination of morality and hypocrisy on people of a little town. Good casting with several secondaries as Michell Ryan, Marianna Hill, Verna Bloom, Walter Barnes, Robert Donner and special mention to Billy Curtis as midget become Sheriff and Mayor. Exquisitely shot by Robert Surtees with a magnificent cinematography on the barren exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds. Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Dee Burton. The film is made in somewhat similar style to ¨Pale rider (1985)¨, only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices. Later on, Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western ¨Unforgiven(1992)¨ also with some common theme.",High Plains Drifter
12,Quinoa1984,an enigmatic western that distinctly marks Eastwood the star as director,10,9 December 2007,"High Plains Drifter will have you and your friends talking, arguing about what happened when and who was really killed, but it's the mystery surrounding the film that elevates it past its spaghetti-western roots. Eastwood has learned from the masters (hence the names on the tombstones- Leone and Siegel- as a tip-of-the-hat if not an entire farewell), and goes past it a little to tell another story of a ruthless gunslinger. Only here the stakes are raised; gone is the gunslinger of Leone's films where money was all that mattered and a good cigar in tow. Also gone is the slightly comic character of Two Mules for Sister Sara. The Stranger is a spooky cat, a guy who rides into a town, 'gets rid' of some bad dudes, and then demands that his services be met to get rid of some more that they need, without letting the town know he's really out for a whole other kind of revenge.There's a sensibility here that reveals Eastwood as a stylist, not merely the simplistic storyteller he's been pegged by some critics (albeit many have now come around following what could also be argued as showy strokes in Million Dollar Baby and his Iwo Jima movies). He lets it go like a western should, most of the time, with tense wide-shots and close-ups, directed for the story. But then those flashbacks; it's like we can't be sure what's coming, except that it's brutality, revealed like a feverish nightmare. And as the film goes on, the sinister edge that Eastwood has on Tidyman's script grows more and more, and the existentialism of the westerns of the period peels away to a much more hopeless realm. Is there any chance of any redemption? While maybe not as iconic as those classic Italian productions, or even as deep and sorrowful as Eastwood's own Unforgiven, High Plains Drifter has little spurts of pitch black humor (there is one killing scene that, perhaps unintentionally, brings it out, plus the classic exchange between the little guy and the Stranger: ""You didn't say your name"" ""I didn't""), blood-curdling violence, and a chilling human element. It's a near masterpiece.",High Plains Drifter
13,hitchcockthelegend,Supernatural Western?,9,20 July 2008,"A lone gunman with no name and seemingly with no past, rides into the dusky town of Lago. The residents of Lago at first view the stranger with suspicion, but when news that some outlaws that are out for blood are on their way to town, they ask the stranger for his help. This is Clint Eastwood's first Western film that he directed, and it's clear and evident that the guy not only loves the genre that made his name, he also knows what makes it work. Obviously having worked for Sergio Leone, Eastwood was making notes because High Plains Drifter oozes the mythical aura of many of Leone's finest genre offerings. To which, with thanks, the result is one of the best offerings in the 70s for the Oater enthusiast. The film opens with our mysterious drifter slowly coming out of the beautiful sprawling haze and into Lago, it's ethereal, then there's just the sound of the horse breathing and the clop of its hooves that can be heard (the sound mix here is incredible), it's a gloriously mysterious opening that sets the tone perfectly. Yet Eastwood is just toying with us though, for a quick jolt of sex and violence snaps us out of the beatific warmth and into a quite hauntingly cold and morally challenged place. From here on in the stranger will demand all manner of odd things from the residents of Lago, he seems to be toying with them and revelling in their discomfort, with Lago quickly resembling an arid hellhole. You see, Lago has a dark secret, and our mysterious stranger has a purpose, and it's this purpose that makes High Plains Drifter an intriguing and gripping experience. A well known fact now is that the great man of the genre, John Wayne, wrote Eastwood to strongly complain about his harsh vision of the West, one can only think the Duke failed to grasp the post Vietnam feel of a 70s made Western. It's a great directorial effort from Eastwood, more so when you marry up his acting performance to his directorial duties. Very much the perfect role, it lets Eastwood accentuate his rugged Western leanings. Eastwood would direct the similarly themed Pale Rider in the 80s and then the genre crown topper Unforgiven in the 90s. A Western great in each decade? Well that will always be debatable, but what we do know is that the Western genre was considerably lucky to have had such a man to keep the genre going for the newer interested wanderers into the Wild West. Beautifully photographed (Bruce Surtees) on the shores of Mono Lake, California, it's a film pungent with sex, sadism, retribution and risks. High Plains Drifter is mystical and magnificent and essential Western fare. 9/10",High Plains Drifter
14,Theo Robertson,Be Careful What You Wish For,7,13 July 2003,"What`s that fable that tells us we should be careful what we wish for ? The Monkey`s Paw is it ? Well HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is more or less the same tale set in a frontier town in the wild west . Callie Travers gets what she wishes for from the stranger and spends the rest of the story complaining about it as do most of the other characters in Lago . Gawd some people are never happy and the town`s folk in Lago don`t deserve to be seeing as they`re both cowards and greedy . Oh and they could have easily defended the town themselves against three outlaws without the help of the stranger , but I guess they`re the sort of people who always in need of someone else to fight their battles . I`m not entirely convinced if it`s the point the film is making but it does seem to have a slightly fascist subtext that might is always right , or at least Darwinism is . I can`t readily except what some other commentators have been saying about HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER being a supernatural film because Ernest Tidyman`s script strikes me as being ambigous rather than supernatural. It`s a very good script and Eastwood show`s us he can be a very good director when he tries , though some of the acting is painfully obvious when the characters are called upon to show fear. Mind you the characters are total cowards so I guess they show their fear by having a convulsive fit",High Plains Drifter
15,jotix100,Painting the town red,8,15 December 2009,"It becomes clear from the beginning of the story the strange man we see arriving at a desolate Western town has his own agenda. We watch him riding on his horse throughout the town, as though he were inspecting it. His visit to the saloon is met with nervousness because he never speaks to anyone. When three men decide to challenge him, they are surprised by the quickness this guy reacts to their threats. Not content with disposing of these scum bags, he takes an insulting woman to a remote spot where he shows her not to mess with him ever again!The higher ups in the mining town decide to engage him. His price turns out to be high. The merchants realize this weird character is what they need to defend them after three notorious bandits are freed from a nearby jail. These bad guys are paying for the crime of torturing and killing the last sheriff in the small town. The powerful people decide to give him free spending in getting what he wants in order to secure his services.The stranger proves to have expensive tastes, something the owners of the main businesses didn't count on. The stranger takes whatever strike his fancy. To irritate everyone he decides to appoint the dwarf that is the object of ridicule, as the new sheriff. He decides to paint the whole town red in preparation of the arrival of the three bandits, and renames it Hell. The stranger proves he is a step ahead when it comes to dealing with the three bad guys.This was Clint Eastwood's second film as a director. He took the Ernest Tydyman's screenplay and turned it into a surprising Western that gave him an opportunity in which to shine. His character is one of the darkest gun men of the West. This was an introspective man that saw the evil ways in which an honest sheriff was killed senselessly. He wanted blood and to avenge his death.Being a director who must direct himself, Mr. Eastwood did a fine job in the finished product. While he is on camera most of the time, there are also satisfying performances from the cast. Verna Bloom appears as the disgusted wife of the hotel owner. Mitchell Ryan, a wonderful actor doesn't have much to do within the large cast assembled. Billy Curtis made a good impression as Mordecai, the dwarf turned sheriff. John Hillerman, who went to have a principal part in ""Magnum P.I"" has a small part here.Bruce Surtees, the cinematographer, was a favorite of both Mr. Eastwood and Don Siegel. He captured the vast panorama of the locations in which the film was set, notably Mono Lake, the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, and the other sites.

Have a nice day.,8,8 August 2015,"Clint Eastwood follows up his directorial debut, the memorable 1971 shocker ""Play Misty for Me"", with this intense, flagrantly un-P.C., stylish film. A grim yet riveting Western with a touch of the (possible) supernatural, it stars Clint as an unnamed person who rides into the seaside mining town of Lago. The folks there fear the return of three former residents, who are now vengeance minded outlaws. Despite the rather nasty actions of the stranger, the townsfolk decide that he's their best bet to protect them from the wrath of these outlaws.The stranger makes himself at home, and takes advantage of the locals when they bend over backwards to make him happy. Eventually, he commands that they re-paint all the buildings red, and the place is re-christened Hell.Clint is at his low key best, displaying that effortless charisma in the role of a man who doesn't exactly go out of his way to endear himself to anybody (much less the audience). Yet he's hardly that out of place since the locals are - ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" style - complicit in some tragedy and barbarism in the past.The widescreen photography is beautiful, as is the stirring music score by Dee Barton. With the help of an excellent crew (also including art director Henry Bumstead), he creates a lot of impressive atmosphere. The viewers will also notice how absolutely brutal the action is, with a lot of gunshot violence and death by whipping.The cast is peppered with a lot of familiar faces and wonderful character actors. Verna Bloom has the most sympathetic female role as Sarah Belding, wife of the hotel owner (Ted Hartley). It's fun to recognize actors as they turn up: Mitchell Ryan, Jack Ging, Stefan Gierasch, Billy Curtis (who has an especially solid role), Geoffrey Lewis, Scott Walker, Walter Barnes, Paul Brinegar, Richard Bull, Robert Donner, John Hillerman, Anthony James, William O'Connell, John Quade, Dan Vadis, etc.""High Plains Drifter"" is unpleasant on occasion, but it's extremely well made and gives us a real gem of a finale, as characters confront one another amid burning buildings.Pretty damn good as far as Clints' efforts in this genre go.Eight out of 10.",High Plains Drifter
17,Doylenf,Eastwood rides into a western town...get those pine boxes ready...,6,29 May 2007,"I rank HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER as a better than average Clint Eastwood film with Eastwood himself at the helm as director. It's really a character driven story set against a western backdrop with Clint as the avenger who rides into town presumably to avenge the murder of a man whipped to death while the townspeople shrank back in the shadows merely watching.We learn later that the whipped man threatened to expose a secret about the town's mine that they were hiding and his name was Marshall Duncan, the man responsible for turning in the outlaws who served prison time and came back for their own brand of revenge.It's a grim story with some clever plotting and a relentlessly suspenseful tone that keeps you glued to your seat until the final acts of revenge have been executed.I know none of the players other than Eastwood, but VERNA BLOOM (who reminds me a little of Vera Miles facially), is excellent as the only halfway decent person who recognizes the mission Eastwood is on. He plays the role with his usual grim sense of humor and sarcasm, riding off into the hills after most of the bad guys are disposed of.The final scene is set up so that he never actually gives his name, but he tells the sheriff inquiring ""What's your name?"" that he should know to whom he's speaking and the camera pans to the grave marker of Marshal Duncan, indicating perhaps that Clint is the brother of the murdered man. At least that's the implication I get from the ending.Summing up: Fascinating, mysterious, enigmatic and compelling western is food for thought...but full of graphic violence, not suitable for young kids.",High Plains Drifter
18,preppy-3,My first Clint Eastwood western...,6,6 August 2007,"...and it might be my last. This film was supposedly ""inspired"" by the tragic murder of Kitty Genovese.A stranger (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the very small town of Lago. Within 15 minutes he's shot three men dead and raped a woman. The townspeople hire him to kill three men who have been released from jail and are coming to the town for revenge.I'm not a fan of Western movies so I'm probably not the best judge on how good this film is. I found it somewhat self-indulgent and a little slow. The violence isn't that graphic (compared to what we have today) but do we need to see a brutal, bloody and long whipping twice? DEFINITE PLOT SPOILERS!!!! The sexism in this in this is just unbelievable. He rapes a hooker (well played by Marianna Hill) and she LIKES it!!! He then seduces Verna Bloom which gives her the courage to leave her husband. It seems that Eastwood thinks he's so great in bed that women automatically love it and get strength from him. What saves this film from being totally worthless is the main plot--the townspeople of Lago stood around and watched while their sheriff was whipped to death. No one tried to help him. (I'm not giving anything away-it's shown at the beginning) So, the townspeople are guilty (in a way) of murder. A reason is given for it--but does that excuse what they did? Also Eastwood is a killer and a rapist. There's not one person in this film to root for. Only Billy Barty comes close. I could be seeing too much into this, but how can you enjoy a movie where all the characters are murderers? SPOILERS END!!!!It is well-directed by Eatwood--there's some really beautiful wide screen photography here. The acting is OK. Eastwood never moves a muscle in his face but the townspeople and the killers themselves are well done. I can't say I enjoyed this but I did find the psychological aspects of the plot very interesting. But it's very full of itself, was boring in parts and is pretty depressing. I can only give it a 6.",High Plains Drifter

He returns as The Man With No Name, seeking revenge for something that happened in the past.He does an outstanding job, and is joined by a great cast that included Geoffrey lewis (The Devil's Rejects).

20,zardoz-13,The Greatest Supernatural Western of All Time,10,11 March 2009,"""High Plains Drifter"" represented Clint Eastwood's second turn behind the camera as a director after ""Play Misty for Me,"" and this rugged, scenic western shoot'em up qualifies as the greatest supernatural western saga ever made. Eastwood learned a thing or two about directing from Sergio Leone. Compare the Man with No Name's entrance into San Miguel in ""Fistful of Dollars"" with the Stranger's entrance into Lago, and you can see Leone made an impression on Eastwood. Shot for shot, Eastwood duplicates Leone, but tweaks it his own clever touches. The sound of the horses' hooves shuffling through the sand and the variety of camera angles as the Stranger rides down the street is nothing short of brilliant. Later, during a night-time shootout after several men try to beat the anti-heroic protagonist to death as he lies asleep in bed, Eastwood pays homage to Don Siegel. He grips his Colt's .45 revolver the way he did in Siegel's ""Dirty Harry."" Just as a robber was blasted backwards by Harry Callahan through a storefront display window, the Stranger nails an assailant with a slug that propels him backwards through a storefront window. This lean mean western is a study in economy. Eastwood directs with a sure hand. If you don't pay close attention to the action, you'd never guess that this is a ghost western. Imagine ""The Fiend that Walked the West"" crossed with ""High Noon"" and you'll have a good idea what to expect from ""High Plains Drifter."" From the first image of Eastwood's duster-clad Stranger riding through a heat mirage to the last image of him vanishing into the same heat mirage, this is unmistakably a ghost western. Dee Barton's eerie music contributes to the moody atmosphere of this saga. Later, the hotel keeper's wife observes that perhaps the dead don't rest in an unmarked grave. One of the last shots in ""High Plains Drifter"" is the dwarf painting a name on a tombstone.The frontier town of Lago lives in fear. Something terrible happened one night on their dark streets and the townspeople have never forgotten the incident. Three unrepentant ruffians, Stacy Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis of ""Every Which Way but Loose""), Cole Carlin (Anthony James of ""Unforgiven""), and Dan Carlin (Dan Vadis of ""Triumph of the Ten Gladiators""), killed Lago City Marshal Jim Duncan (stunt man Buddy Van Horn) with bull whips. The entire town watched as these three hellions whipped the lawman to death. Nobody raised a hand to stop them. The men who formed the conspiracy, Dave Drake (Mitchell Ryan of ""Magnum Force"") and Morgan Allen (Jack Ging), operate a mining company. They learned that upright, honest Marshal Duncan had discovered they were excavating gold from government land, and he threatened to inform the authorities. Drake and Allen hired Bridges and the Carlin brothers to kill Duncan. Afterward, they planted a gold ingot where these killers lived, framed them for a robbery, and had them railroaded into prison. As ""High Plains Drifter"" opens, this murderous trio has just been released, and they are heading straight to Lago to square accounts.Meanwhile, the paranoid citizens of Lago have hired three gunslingers to run strangers out of town. The Stranger (Clint Eastwood of ""Joe Kidd"") arrives to get a bottle of whiskey, and tough guy Billy Borders and his two cohorts try to intimidate him. He leaves the bar and takes a chair in the barbershop across the street. Borders and company follow him. They try to kill him while he is getting shaved. They believe he is unarmed, but he has faked them off by putting a carved piece of wood in his holster. When they make their move, he blows all three of them away without a qualm. Drake sends Sheriff Sam Shaw (Spaghetti western actor Walter Barnes) over to offer him a proposition. The Stranger can have anything in town he wants for free if he will protect them from Bridges and the Carlin boys. The Stranger accepts their offer and promptly ridicules them by appropriating Shaw's badge and pinning it on the town dwarf Mordecai.
Mordecai (Billy Curtis of ""The Terror of Tiny Town"") revels in his newfound importance and angers several of the leading citizens. This subplot is reminiscent of the Lee Van Cleef spaghetti western ""Day of Anger"" where the hero made a gunslinger out of the town tramp, and the citizens refused to bow and scrape to him. Furthermore, the Stranger makes the town mayor Jason Hobart (Stefan Gierasch of ""What's up Doc"") give an Indian a pile of blankets and jars of candy for his kids. The Stranger forms the Lago Volunteers and drills the pusillanimous townspeople in the art of ambush. Meanwhile, he makes Mexican laborers tear down a barn to build picnic tables, and he orders the citizens paint their town red. Riding out to the town sign, The Stranger paints HELL over Lago, and then abandons Lago when Stacy and the Carlin brothers hit the town like marauders. The final shoot out in Lago at night with orange flames licking the buildings and back lighting the action makes for a fantastic mise-en-scene!The cast is uniformly excellent. Geoffrey Lewis is superb as the revenge ravenous Stacy. Eastwood's old co-star from his TV series ""Rawhide"" Paul Brinegar plays the barkeeper, and in a pre-""Magnum, P.I."" role, John Hillerman plays the boot maker. Bruce Surtees' widescreen cinematography is striking. Eastwood couldn't have chosen a better-looking location on Lake Mono in the California Sierras. Ernst Tidyman, who won an Oscar for ""The French Connection"" and ""Dirty Harry's"" Dean Riesner provide several memorable lines of dialogue. ""High Plains Drifter"" resembles a Spaghetti western with respect to its arid setting and its swift-shooting gunslinger protagonist. The imaginative use of bullwhips rather than rifles adds immeasurably to the action. Eastwood's wry, understated sense of humor shines through every scene. This is a superior western, far better than the lame ""High'em High.""",High Plains Drifter

23,neil-476,Conceptual western,8,9 March 2011,"Clint Eastwood, having achieved world top box office draw status by way of spaghetti westerns (built on traditional TV westerns) never lost the opportunity to go somewhere a little bit different, and High Plains Drifter was one of his earliest ventures off the beaten track.While undoubtedly a western, High Plains Drifter takes the bold step of cross pollinating the western genre with a revenge plot and an oblique supernatural story. Eastwood, the drifter of the title, arrives in the town of Lago, only to be recruited by the townsfolk in a solitary Magnificent Seven role to defend them against revenge-bent criminals newly released from jail. It turns out that Eastwood's stranger has some revenge of his own in mind, on not only the crooks but also the townspeople, for he appears to be (it is not spelled out) the reincarnation of the lawman they failed to support when the crooks last came to call.This was a bold and original scenario for a western but, under Eastwood's knowing directorship, it succeeds admirably, having a distinctly otherwordly atmosphere underling the traditional western trappings.",High Plains Drifter
24,Uriah43,Hell Comes to the Town of Lago,7,27 April 2017,"This movie begins with a cowboy (played by Clint Eastwood) riding out of the desert heat into a small town called ""Lago"". He then goes into the only saloon in town where he encounters a problem with three cowboys but rather than get into it with them he decides to go to the barbershop for a shave. The three cowboys follow and upon provoking him they get shot for their efforts. Minutes later a woman named """"Callie Travers"" (Marianna Hill) deliberately bumps into him on the street and then starts and berating him for no particular reason. One thing leads to another and eventually he drags her into a barn and proceeds to rape her. After that he heads to the local hotel to get a room where he immediately falls asleep on the bed and has a nightmare of being whipped to death in this same town while all of the townspeople look on. The next day ""Sheriff Sam Shaw"" (Walter Barnes) comes to see him and with the blessing of the town council offers him anything he wants if he will protect the town from three outlaws who are due to be released from prison and plan to ride into town in the next couple of days. But what the sheriff and the townspeople don't realize is that this particular cowboy has his own way of doing things and doesn't particularly care whether they like his methods or not. Not only that but he has a secret agenda of his own. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good-albeit highly unusual-type of Western with definite paranormal overtures. Again, this film is not a typical Western but I found it to be quite entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",High Plains Drifter

26,The_Void,The Man With No Name returns,8,17 January 2005,"A spaghetti western with horror influences. Sounds like a film that was written by God, directed by Jesus and shot in heaven, and it is...well, almost. Although Clint Eastwood's horror-western is undoubtedly a very nice little story, it lacks the epic vision of the classic Leone films and so can't be considered in the same divine category that it could have been if it was. The film exudes a very low budget feel, most of which comes from the very small village that has been constructed and the fact that most of the acting is terrible. It doesn't matter, though, and these things actually add to the film in the long run as they lend it the classic spaghetti western feel. As you might expect, Clint plays the character he is best known for; the Man With No Name. Here, he takes that character to the extreme as he gives a very malevolent and uncaring performance, which is far from 'the Good'. The common shoot-out scenes are present, but Clint has also decided to include a rather graphic rape scene, which will no doubt offend some viewers.Clint Eastwood is a minimalist filmmaker. His directorial style is solid and unfussy and as anyone who's ever seen a Clint Eastwood film will know; he's a man of very few words. This is of obvious advantage to the film as it means that it remains efficient throughout, which engages the audience and ensures they don't get bored. The way Clint plays the character is magnificent, as he continually makes us believe that he is infallible; which is needed for the film to work. Eastwood also succeeds in creating a cerebral atmosphere, which gives the film it's element of fascination. The fact that Eastwood directs and stars makes this a big personal achievement for him personally also. As I say, this isn't the greatest spaghetti western of all time; but it's a long way from the worst and fans of Eastwood will be in heaven seeing him perform his greatest role again.",High Plains Drifter

(you will get what I am saying if you saw this film)  In the end we do not know if the character is from hell, or someone who knew about the events that happened.  There is one really good scene in the barbershop with Eastwood, with the local gunfighters.",High Plains Drifter
28,SimonJack,Eastwood's ongoing love of the spaghetti Western genre,5,11 September 2021,"In this tenth film of Clint Eastwood's own movie production venture, The Malpaso Company, the actor and director returns to the style of the spaghetti Westerns that propelled him to stardom in the mid-1960s. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" of 1964, ""For a Few Dollars More"" of 1965, and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" of 1966 - all directed by Sergio Leone, are probably the best known and likely to be remembered films of the spaghetti genre in the future.It puzzles me that these films were so hugely popular in their day, and seem to remain so among movie fans well into the 21st century. At least, among those who weigh in and rate films on IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and other Web sites about movies. I saw these films when they came out in theaters. They were ballyhooed a lot in the press and ads at that time. While I enjoyed them some at the time - probably for the adrenalin charges in their splurges of action and violence, these were films that never left me satisfied afterwards. There was always something troubling and distasteful about the brutality, meanness, of the stories. Even the heroes beating the bad guys in their own backyards or games, didn't overcome the distaste for the cruelty and crudity of the plots.Well, after watching ""High Plains Drifter"" again - a few decades later, I had no adrenalin charges but similar reservations. Two especially dark aspects are much more apparent. Both have to do with women -- views of women, respect, etc. First is the insinuation that both women (young or early middle-aged) had hidden lustful desires for the seeming macho stranger - Eastwood's drifter, and that they could and would immediately be pleased and satisfied after having sex with him. In both cases, they were rapes, however quickly they might have been made to appear to be consensual. This isn't overly analyzing or picking scenes or a plot apart, but a very real simple assessment of what the film actually portrays, as well as implies.The second dark aspect is related. The drifter himself, and the tone of the film itself, are misogynistic. Oh, sure, the young Callie Travers (Marianna Hill) acts like a floozy in bumping into the drifter when she walks by him and makes a fuss about it. And, he at first holds back, but then drags her to the barn. That'll teach her a lesson - being raped and having sex for his (and her) pleasure. By the time of his second rape of Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom), the film quickly overcomes her real fear and dread of the guy by having her hidden sexual appetite satisfied by this guy.The misogynism isn't just with Eastwood's character, but is apparent in small flashes here and there. Sarah's husband has no respect for her. The women are just objects to keep men warm at night.The writers, director and producers try to assuage these and other dark aspects of this film (the violence, social meanness, crudity) with a sense of justice being served. There's a dig at the hypocrisy of the town when the sheriff says that Lago is a God-fearing town. That the drifter could bring about repercussions on the community - especially the dishonest male leaders, for their part in having a just man brutally killed before the eyes of everyone, obviously aims to placate the undertone of a plea for justice. But in the end, the whole matter of justice is muddled by the conclusion that violence overcomes violence; and that real life matters of fairness, decency, and respect don't count for anything.One other aspect of the film stood out in my later years of viewing - the occasional use of a bit of philosophy or psychology in the script. These may be intended to further placate the violence of the hero. Or, maybe to soften his character somewhat by giving the impression that he is wise and a good wielder of justice. Two instances in the film have short scenes and exchanges. The first is with The Stranger and Sarah Belding. She says, ""Be careful. You're a man who makes people afraid, and that's dangerous."" And Eastwood's drifter replies, ""Well, it's what people know about themselves inside that makes 'em afraid."" The second instance is toward the end with Mordecai in the saloon. Mordecai says, ""What about after? What about after we do it?"" The drifter says, ""Hmmm?"" Mordecai asks, ""What do we do then?"" And the drifter answers, ""Then you live with it.""Regardless of a movie's plot, entertainment, story value, or any other aspects, there is the acting. Most of the supporting cast are very good, and that's the reason I give it five stars. This isn't a film for anyone to watch who isn't a very mature adult.",High Plains Drifter
29,christopher-underwood,"just how beautifully the film has been shot, as we watched people being shot.",10,16 August 2017,"Not having watched much of Clint Eastwood's work, I'm now playing catch-up and having a rather good time. This one, his second as director, is a most accomplished work. He has completely ditched the old US notion of westerns and, clearly under the influence of Serge Leone, sold his soul to the devil and taken on the mindset of the spaghetti western film makers. Mysterious stranger (?) comes into town, kills three, rapes a women and gets a beer and a bottle, in the first quarter of an hour. He also, almost, gets a shave but that maybe would be giving the game away. Does have a bath in dirty looking water, makes friends with a little fella and almost dies (for the second time. And so it goes on. There is an inevitability to the seeming unresolved issues involving the 'good' people of the town and all the while we await the arrival of the three baddies. But it is a big build up to Clint saving everybody, except we begin to wonder if he has his heart in, never mind the soul he may or may not have sold to the devil to make any of this possible. Great film, all through. We are clearly told what will happen. No funny business. But while we assess and reassess some of those not so good town's folk, Mr Eastwood catches us out with a blinder and then fades out in a mirage with a great parting shot and a reminder just how beautifully the film has been shot, as we watched people being shot.",High Plains Drifter
30,whpratt1,Clint Eastwood was Outstanding,8,22 April 2008,"Clint Eastwood plays the role as a stranger who visits a small Western town and takes complete control of this town called Lago which has very cruel and evil people living their and Clint walks into big trouble. As you watch this film you will begin to realize why this particular stranger visits this town because of the horrible murder of a U S Marshall who is bull whipped to death. Clint Eastwood directed this film and created a very different Western which clearly showed how men and women in a small town can be so evil and become so self-centered. Clint added plenty of romantic scenes with women, and some could very well be considered rape in a horse stable and a hotel room. John Wayne did not care for Clint's change in this type of Western, but we all know that Eastwood made many new and different Westerns, namely: ""Unforgiven"".",High Plains Drifter
31,JamesHitchcock,Various Shades of Black,6,4 April 2011,"""High Plains Drifter"" was the second film directed by Clint Eastwood (after ""Play Misty for Me""), and the first Western. The theme- the efforts of a small mining town to defend itself against a gang of criminals with the help of a mysterious outsider- is very similar to that of a later Eastwood Western, ""Pale Rider"". The character played here by Eastwood, referred to only as The Stranger, is also reminiscent of an earlier Eastwood hero, the Man with No Name in the ""Dollars"" trilogy of spaghetti Westerns he made with Sergio Leone. Not only is he nameless, he is also laconic, soft-spoken, cigar-chewing and capable of ruthlessness when it suits his interests.The differences between ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Pale Rider"" perhaps reflect the differences between the periods in which they were made. In the sixties and early seventies there was a trend towards ""revisionist"" Westerns such as Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" or Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs Miller"", films which called into question the moral certainties on which many earlier Westerns had been based. The causes of this tendency have been debated, but one influence seems to have been a decline in American patriotism and self-confidence deriving from factors such as the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.""High Plains Drifter"", dating from 1973, falls (in some respects at least) within the revisionist tradition. The inhabitants of the mining town of Lago are not innocent victims of a criminal gang but are themselves guilty of corruption and physical cowardice and are, in part, themselves to blame for the predicament in which they find themselves. The Stranger is no clean-cut, all-American hero; within a short while of his arrival in Lago he has shot dead three men in circumstances which only doubtfully amount to self-defence and has raped a woman. (Like a number of Eastwood's other films- ""The Beguiled"", ""Play Misty for Me"" and ""The Gauntlet"" come to mind- this one has a misogynistic streak running through it).By the time ""Pale Rider"" was made in the Reagan era of the mid-eighties, America's self-confidence was reviving, and although very few Westerns were being made during that period the old moral certainties were being revived in other genres, with movies like the ""Star Wars"", ""Superman"" and ""Indiana Jones"" franchises. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that ""Pale Rider"", like Lawrence Kasdan's ""Silverado"" made around the same time, is much less revisionist than ""High Plains Drifter"". There is a much sharper moral distinction between the miners and their villainous adversaries and the mysterious gunfighter who comes to their aid is much more unambiguously heroic.Both films have supernatural overtones, with a suggestion that the characters played by Eastwood are ghosts returned from the dead to seek revenge on those who wronged them in their lifetimes. In ""Pale Rider"" those overtones are not only supernatural but also religious; Eastwood's character is referred to as The Preacher and he is explicitly linked with one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. (""Behold a pale horse, and his name that sat upon him was Death""). No direct suggestion is made in ""Pale Rider"" as to who The Preacher might have been in his lifetime, but in ""High Plains Drifter"" The Stranger is identified with Jim Duncan, the former Marshal of Lago who was whipped to death to prevent him from revealing that the mine upon which the town's prosperity depends had been illegally sunk on Government land. Eastwood, in fact, has said that the Stranger was originally to have been the dead man's brother, but he preferred a more mystical interpretation.The film is attractively photographed and competently directed; Eastwood's directorial style was clearly influenced by the directors he had previously worked with such as Leone and Don Siegel. The film-makers clearly went to some expense, building a complete Western town on the shores of Mono Lake, California; hence the name Lago. (The actors do not seem to have been in agreement as to how this name should be pronounced- most use the correct Spanish pronunciation, but some anglicise it to Lay-go).The film has been critically acclaimed, but it has never really been my favourite among Eastwood's movies. The makers of ""revisionist"" Westerns often claimed that, in the name of a greater realism, they were abandoning the sharp black/white moral distinctions which had once characterised the genre in favour of shades of grey. The trouble with ""High Plains Drifter"" is that there are really no shades of grey; Eastwood has simply abandoned white in favour of various shades of black. Lago may have no clean-cut heroes, but it has plenty of villains. The Stranger and his accomplices are little, if any, better than the outlaws. This may, or may not, be a more ""realistic"" portrayal of life in the Old West than the one given in films like ""High Noon"", but the implied supernatural elements in ""High Plains Drifter"" suggest that realism was not Eastwood's main concern. The film has its virtues, but for me the moral squalor of virtually all its characters means that it does not work as a traditional Western, and its mystical tendencies mean that it does not work as a revisionist one either. 6/10",High Plains Drifter
32,Red-Barracuda,A menacing and mysterious western,7,5 June 2014,"High Plains Drifter was Clint Eastwood's first western as director and it shows that he had absorbed a lot from Sergio Leone, who he worked under to make the Dollars Trilogy in the 60's. It's an American film that resembles an Italian western in many ways. Its plot is typical enough - a mysterious stranger arrives in a joyless settlement called Lago, populated by immoral, cowardly folks and ends up working as a mercenary for them in thwarting a gang of outlaws whose arrival is imminent. It's quite an unoriginal plot to be honest but it's the details that surround it that make it quite unique.There is an unmistakable mystic aura about it, with the stranger entering the film out of a strange mist and ending the film in a similar way. While it remains fairly oblique, it's certainly very prominently suggested that his character is some kind of avenging angel from beyond the grave and that he may be some form of incarnation of a marshal who was murdered in the same town some time ago. This incident is alluded to by dream-like flashbacks where it is made abundantly clear that the townspeople were as much to blame for the killing as the outlaws who executed it. Consequently, the stranger is not only hell bent on revenge against these hoodlums but he also wants to teach this town a harsh lesson too. In this way, while he ultimately defends them, he puts them through some traumas in doing so. Because the townspeople he is to save are so morally bankrupt, this changes the dynamic significantly and the movie has much less clearly defined morals. Eastwood directed a very similar themed western in the 80's, Pale Rider, which dispensed with these troubling conundrums and made it more of a clear case of good against evil; High Plains Drifter is the more interesting film precisely because it did not do this. Eastwood himself has more or less made an acting career out of playing dark heroes but his character here has to be the most extreme of all his anti-heroes, after all he not only kills with little concern but he also rapes a woman to put her in her place. This is a very questionable scene to be perfectly honest and very troubling.It's a very stylised film too, which really adds a fair bit. The final fiery showdown in the town that has been painted red and renamed 'Hell' is particularly memorable, while reinforcing the supernatural aura. The town itself is practically a character too. It's a settlement so small we can feel the whole of it. Its unusual lakeside setting additionally adds a strange atypical feel. The flashback scene of the whipping is nightmarish with an ominous soundtrack, similarly when Eastwood unexpectedly exits Lago it is accompanied by an unusual insistent, probing guitar riff than disorientates the viewer somewhat. It sums up the film in some respects in that, despite a very standard story line on the surface, there is something very strange and mysterious about High Plains Drifter. Its ambiguity and mysteriousness are strange for a western but for these reasons it remains extremely interesting.",High Plains Drifter
33,sddavis63,A Bit Too Dark For My Liking,4,15 July 2010,"As the movie begins, your mind is immediately drawn to the later Eastwood picture ""Pale Rider"": Eastwood's mysterious character appears in an Old West mining town that's terrorized by the thought of three returning outlaws, and they hire this stranger to be their protector. The similarities really end there, though. Eastwood's character in this is far less noble and selfless than his character in ""Pale Rider."" In fact, he isn't noble or selfless at all. He's motivated by a desire for revenge and nothing more. The three outlaws he agrees to take on viciously beat and - yes - murdered him in the town a few years back while the townsfolk looked on and did nothing to help him. So he has few kind thoughts for the residents of the town either.And, yes, I said that Eastwood's character had been murdered years before. A quasi-spiritual element gets added to this movie with that bit of knowledge that gets revealed slowly over the course of the film. Eastwood's character had been buried in an unmarked grave, and local legend had it that anyone buried in an unmarked grave won't rest. Duncan (the name of Eastwood's character in life) certainly wasn't resting. The whole thing led up to a decent enough confrontation at the end of the movie that leaves the outlaws dead and the town devastated and Duncan riding off into the wilderness, apparently having earned his rest.Eastwood did well with the role. It's the sort of role he could probably do in his sleep. The rest of the cast was solid - no one particularly outstanding, but no one who dragged the movie down either. It was an OK movie. I just found it a little too dark for my liking, lacking in any truly redeeming purpose. It did make me appreciate ""Pale Rider"" even more than I already did, though, with the very different take Eastwook put on that very similar character.",High Plains Drifter
34,gridoon,Essential Eastwood.,7,30 May 2002,"Enigmatic, mystical Western, certainly one of the most original films of this genre ever made (perhaps THE most original).At the same time, it's the one film that would be enough for someone to see for a precise definition of the archetypal Eastwood persona: he's nameless, laconic, ultra-cool, and deadly. And he has a great dry sense of humor; the film has some of the most quotable one-liners of his career (""I ain't your brother""). There is a certain inconsistency, however; some of the best-known ""metaphysical laws"" don't seem to apply to this character....was that intentional, so that we would always consider other possibilities as well?

35,sol1218,Drifting Winds,8,21 October 2003,"Clint Eastwood revives his signature role as ""The Man with no Name"" as he seems to come out of nowhere from the distant prairie and descends upon the sleepy little town of Largo and after that things there will never be the same again for the people who live there.A film that has a lot more to it then what you see at first with Eastwood not being that mysterious and having a past which is seen in flashback every so often in the movie. Styled a lot like ""High Noon"" but with a twist that builds up slowly at first then takes off like a loose bronco to it's dramatic and fiery conclusion.""High Plains Drifter"" doesn't follow the well worn standard western scenario which is why it make it unique and thought-provoking at the same time. Eastwood was never better here as the cool yet pragmatic stranger who's very anonymity makes him both mysterious and threatening to everyone he ruins into, friend or foe. Over the years since ""High Plains Drifter"" was released, back in 1973, it has reached cult statues and Eastwood has never made another western as good and as ""High Plains Drifter"" and that includes ""The Unforgiven"". Eastwood is more then a match against those out to get him but what they, his enemies as well as the audience, don't know until the very end of the movie is that Clint has something, besides his quick guns and steel nerves, that is far beyond that of mortal man.",High Plains Drifter
36,lost-in-limbo,"Welcome to Lago, no actually its Hell!",9,4 August 2005,"A mysteriously callous stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides out of the desert into a small town called Lago and terrifies the locals by raping a lady and treading over the townsfolk, but when he kills three cowboys who wanted to make something out of nothing. The inhabitants are grateful that he freed them, but then they try to hire him to protect from three more cowboys who will return back to town when they finish their jail sentence in the next day or two. The stranger refuses the offer at first but when they tell him he can take anything for free and have power over the town he accepts the offer. Through this power he changes things around in town for his pleasure and this causes disruption amongst the locals who seem to regret hiring him.Oh, I just love this bewildering film and I can't get enough of it! What we get here is a brutally mystical revenge western by Director/Star Clint Eastwood. I was totally mesmerised by it and Eastwood's direction is on the boil by capturing a strong essence of charm and also discomfort. It has a lot of elements going for it that it makes you (well, me) want to watch it over and over again. That's probably a good idea too, as thorough symbolisms and blinding supernatural occurrences fill the cryptic story. Some you might pick up on, while others don't seem to standout but are hidden under the material. Those enigmatic factors really keep your full interest, as the plot is played out very well with an eerie beginning that just pulls you in and then it ends with such a cunning conclusion. Before we get to the conclusion the haunting climax definitely builds sheer dread and packs bite with its visuals a lot of bite! There's not much action in the film, but the story's subplots is what guides it and slowly builds the questions. You just wonder - There's got to be more to this new stranger in town and the townsfolk seemed to be keeping some hidden secret (or sin) behind close doors? The more the story builds on those the queries the less you seem to worry about the lack of gunfights and brawls. You actually start to read more into these mysteries when some of the questions are answered towards the end. Though, also watching the stranger toy around with the (guilty) townsfolk is pretty riveting stuff.Another feature that blows you away would be how atmospheric it does get, with a pounding and alienating score that ticks away with its high pitch and howling sounds. These just added more unease to Eastwood's character when he was on screen with this humming score in the background. It just holds such an inspiring awe with its striking rigorous and desolated backdrop that went hand-to-hand with the brood horror and hell that follows the town's inhabitants. Engrossing scenery fills the back-shot with its vast mountains ranges and open spaces of dirt and rocks. One thing that stood out for me was the quieter moments, when it focused on body language and facial expressions to portray emotions. This really added to the alarming mood and a fairly sparse script was incredibly effective in making it highly-strung. Even the uneasy sound effects are used to great effect, especially in a particular nightmare scene. Violence is pretty much in your face and at times rather brutal, but Eastwood paces it superbly and fits it into the story. The humour that fills the story is a bit of a variety as sometimes there would be some subtle and dry humour, but then again when the dwarf was on screen it seems to play more as a loud joke. Steady camera-work is evident with plenty angle shots from behind and above and the occasional zoom. The texture of the film's material and powerful visuals is real moody, daring and it has a fairly cold-hearted tone to it all. It just leaves you with such an empty feeling.Performance wise the cast was nothing but top-grade. Dauntingly malevolent is a good way to describe Eastwood persona as the mysterious stranger, in which he gives a typically first-rate and hypnotic performance (as usual). Is he some sort of Revenging Angel or a ghost of the past? This is what you ask. But anti-hero definitely comes to mind. The supporting cast is exceptional with the likes of the Verna Bloom, Billy Curtis, Marianna Hill, Mitch Ryan, Stefan Gierasch and Jack Ging.This is one spellbinding semi-supernatural Western!",High Plains Drifter
37,Robert_duder,"Completely disturbing, dark, violent western with an interesting Supernatural element",9,31 July 2006,"High Plains Drifter is one of the many Westerns I have seen as of recently. So far it is the most unique, and the most dark, twisted story yet. Clint Eastwood directs but this is far from usual tale. High Plains Drifter is perhaps one of the most unique westerns in existence because of it's Supernatural suggestions and it's disturbing theme. Nonetheless you'll be captivated by it's mood and style and when it's all said and done you'll likely have many questions and want to see it again although it will leave you feeling truly afraid for the first time of The Man With No Name.Clint Eastwood directs and stars as the mysterious stranger who rides into a small town one day and faces a group of gun slingers hired to keep trash out of the small town. But in true Eastwood style he makes short work of them and suddenly becomes the only gun slinger in town to protect them. But is he protecting them?? This time Eastwood's stranger is disturbed, vicious, violent, completely off the deep end. Whereas the strangers in his previous films have been far more cool and collective there is something evil about this man. As the film is hyped in the first 20 minutes he commits three murders and a rape and takes control of the town. Seeing Eastwood in this role is a little jarring always having pictured him as the Western Hero but still he plays the role to it's fullest and makes this what it is. Billy Curtis plays Mordecai, the man who becomes the stranger's wing man so to speak. Curtis is more of the hero than anyone in town and is mostly under rated by everyone there. He does a great job of adding the overall feeling of gloom to the small town. The rest of the cast that make up the small town including Verna Bloom, Mitch Ryan, Robert Donner, Jack Ging, and Stefan Gierasch do a great job. They all have this distinct air of being dirty, evil, no good, and as the history of this town unfolds we discover their individual sins and deeds that they have committed. Terrific character actor Geoffrey Lewis plays Stacey Bridges, the typical Western villain riding himself into a completely not typical western town where sin is being rectified. When Eastwood is the most evil thing in the Western you'd have to be a good actor to still come across as a bad guy and Lewis does that perfectly. He's a worth adversary to Eastwood's stranger.High Plains Drifter is one Western I could debate and discuss on for hours and hours. I think Eastwood is a ghost or some sort of angel of Vengeance sent to this town to make them pay for allowing a good man to be whipped to death in front of them in order to hide their shady business dealings with a mine that belonged to the Government. There is so much depth and hidden story to this film that it is just amazing!! The entire back story of this town unfolds while we are watching Eastwood exact his revenge and turn this town into Hell, literally. We don't know exactly what the town has done until it's nearly all over but he gets his vengeance and makes them pay. Without a doubt a disturbing and twisted film and an absolute must see for anyone who loves cinema and wants something different from a classic, tried and true genre like The Western and leave it to Eastwood to pull it off. I think High Plains Drifter is probably one of the most underrated films of all time. The tone of the film and message and story is so disturbing I'm not sure I'd ever watch it again and yet that being said it was so brilliant. I know many have said that Eastwood has explained numerous times the stranger in this film and that he was completely human but I like to look at it from a Supernatural angle because there is a sincere shiver up my spine when Mordecai says to Eastwood's stranger ""I don't even know who you are"" and Eastwood says...""Yes you do"" and rides off into the sunset until he literally vanishes into thin air. It's completely different and a must see!! 9/10",High Plains Drifter
38,ElMaruecan82,Poetic Justice Served by Clint Eastwood...,8,16 July 2019,"A heat haze reigns over the high plains, making them look like the valleys of the shadow of death. Emerging from the mistiness a lone rider seems to make one with the shadow, coming to our direction. It's not an entrance as much as an appearance, and in the small town of Lago, not the most welcomed one. From the simple by-standers to the business owners, gazes of bewilderment and barely concealed fears converge to his direction, stares that say ""who is he?"" ""where does he come from?"" ""what is he doing here?"". As usual, Clint Eastwood looks like he doesn't give a d***, and we -viewers- know we'll be lucky if one of the three questions gets an answer.That's the attitude Eastwood built his legend on, as the emerging Western icon after John Wayne but closer to a Bogart-like figure, Eastwood had that edge over Wayne, he didn't need a story, his 'presence' could make a film. Eastwood emerged with the late 60s and his ""Man-With-No-Name"" character immediately appealed to a young generation of movie goers longing for outcasts who could reflect their own defiance toward the petty preoccupations of a conservative society, minus the insecurity. Eastwood played rebellious characters but with coolness oozing from his apparent detachment, he made his charisma so effortless that he stole Wayne's thunder.Speaking of Wayne, that he criticized ""High Plain Drifters"" in an open letter to Eastwood proves the latter's point, he might have played a ""right-wing fantasy"" in ""Dirty Harry"" but when you're criticized by Wayne in 1973, you're not in conflict with the Western icon but with the out-of-touch director of ""Green Berets"". Eastwood was old-fashioned but in a revolutionary way. And this is why his figure as the lonesome stranger coming from nowhere but not for nothing became an enduring trademark of his own, one that stuck to him until his Oscar-winning ""Unforgiven"". And twenty years later, Eastwood knew the secret ingredient he had to instill in his movies: making his Stranger's character as quiet and stingy in words as his Leone's counterpart and as effective in words and action as his Don Siegel's Harry.Some critics saw in the film an attempt to imitate the masters but that's an unfair trial because what Eastwood imitates (not without a few ounces of self-awareness) is the character he created and whom he plagiarizes with insistence, because that's the way you build your own style. As a director, he's rather minimalist and linear, with a few flashbacks cleverly inserted to give a needed boost to the plot, until a climax that looks like nothing seen before, not in old Westerns, not in Leone's: surrealism with a meaning. In ""Pale Rider"", a similar confrontation would be handled in a less showy manner but ""High Plain Drifters"" redeems its lack of subtlety by the boldness of his protagonist and his personal motives that give a weird of plausibility in his actions, it might even be Eastwood's way to renovate the Western genre, whipping the dust off with a mystical savagery.That's Eastwood's touch, to infuse spirituality in seemingly ordinary stories, with mysterious but not unreal protagonists, men with a way with the gun and the ladies and yet accessible to the common folks, never too detached, never too straightforward... there's an element of humor and balance that keep his heroes rooted in reality while their aura evokes supernatural elements. Now, it would ruin the experience to reveal what ""High Plain Drifters"" is about but let's say it involves a town that is so full of coward people that it makes Hadleyville people look like the Magnificent Seven The film opens with the Stranger killing three thugs who were literally begging for it, as a result, the town asks him for protection against three outlaws who are coming to attack them. He accepts, but not without a price.As the plot moves on, a few hints are given, the sound of a whip alerts the Stranger, a woman bumps into him in a way to 'make acquaintance' What he does after is condemnable and ugly but what the scene denounces is the apathy and lack of reaction of the men not without reminding of ""Dirty Harry"" and whose correlation with the Stranger's mission is revealed later. Meanwhile, the film oscillates between moments of ominous quietness, brutality and humor, especially when the town is ready to accept any of the Stranger's wishes including the nomination of the town's midget (Billy Curtis) mayor as sheriff and mayor. The Strangers throws customers out of the hotel, making an enemy out of the owner, and a friend out of his wife (Verna Bloom). Later, some treacheries are revealed among the ""good"" people of Lago, which broadens even more the notions of good and evil, an issue that became persistent in Eastwood's body of work as soon he started making movies.""High Plain Drifters"" denounces the evilness lying in every human being who acts wrongly but also the lack of reaction of the seemingly good citizen, the more violent scenes involves a nasty public lynching by whipping where we see people staring at a good man being tortured, with a silence that truly gives consent. We never really get to know what ties the flashback with the Stranger, however we know there's a record to settle and that some incidents are so dramatic that it takes a certain dose of poetic justice to fix it, a vision of what is right that doesn't necessarily indulge in being good, that might not be the vision of everyone of the West, but it was Eastwood's and it fit the mood of the 70s and we're disillusioned enough to embrace his poetry almost five decades later.John Wayne was in position to criticize him but time certainly did justice to the director who did justice in his own movies... when he gets back to the heat haze, we know justice was done and it's satisfying enough.",High Plains Drifter
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A revisionist stance and dark approach make this a worthwhile Western.,7,10 May 2018,"'High Plains Drifter (1973)' has some dodgy sexual politics that can't go unmentioned, with our so-called hero openly committing rape and implying his victim wanted it. However, the nameless protagonist isn't exactly a good guy and that's kind of the point. The film has a sort of callousness to it, an eerie sense of foreboding that exaggerates its themes of guilt, inaction and potentially otherworldly vengeance. Indeed, the flick's ambiguously ghostly elements are its most interesting aspects, as they add an extra layer to what could have been a fairly straightforward affair. The picture takes a revisionist stance and doesn't pull any punches, focusing on the brutality of its violence rather than the valiance of its stars. However, it still provides some fun sequences, especially when Eastwood starts squinting and the bullets start flying. Overall, it's an enjoyable and fairly distinct western.

It's easily his best western since The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.

He also gives a Native American (yelled at by the shop keeper) some blankets and his children a jar of sweets!! So it's swings and round shouts I suppose!! The movie is well directed by Clint, it has a sharp script and the cast is full of Malpaso regulars. And the haunting, eerie score by Dee Barton stays with you long after the movie ends.

41,sol-,More than just a drifter,8,27 February 2016,"Fearful of three recently released outlaws who murdered their previous sheriff, the citizens of a small Old West town hire a mysterious gunslinger to protect them, but the stranger knows more than he lets on this offbeat western with a 'Twilight Zone' style twist. While the twist at first feels like an afterthought, it begins to make more and more sense when one reconsiders prior events, and while the gunslinger initially seems merely heartless and cruel with the way he humiliates the townsfolk when given carte blanche and unlimited store credit for his services, all of this comes across as logical in the end. Plot turns aside, the film offers an interesting outlook on the risks of giving someone absolute power, and it is curiously debatable whether the townsfolk would be better off at the mercy of the outlaws than the very unpredictable stranger who enjoys raping their women, drinking all their booze and wrecking property where possible. Clint Eastwood plays the part well with a quiet charisma, but even as an antihero, he is a bit too dislikeable (making light of a violent rape; destroying buildings) for one to root for him - and given how despicable all of the townsfolk are shown to be, 'High Plains Drifter' is a film without a single likable character in sight. That said, there is perhaps something deliberate to this as the film noticeably plays against stereotypes of chivalry in the Old West.

We barely see the bad guys do anything, well, bad. They seem more like victims, especially during the climactic scene.A strange movie, this one. The soundtrack is constantly eerie and effective.

He makes his presence known by killing three men and raping a woman. The Stranger is hired by the townspeople to lead the defence against three newly released prisoners who want revenge against the town. But The Stranger's presence leads to conflict within the town as he is given carte blanche to do whatever he wants as the townspeople have their own dark secret.High Plains Drifter is a dark, violent film set in amoral world. There are few likable characters as violence is a way of life and there are moral dilemmas are presented in the film, such as the hiring of a man who rapes, the town's willingness to frame three power hungry thugs that were hired by the mining company and the town's witnessing of the death of the old sheriff and not doing anything to help him. The whipped scene reminded me of the story the murder of Kitty Genovese who was murdered and no one in her apartment block helped her despite her screams: and it turned out that the writer was heavily influenced by that cast.High Plains Drifter does have a supernatural edge to it, being more ambiguous about the main character, his actions and his motives. There is an eerie quality throughout, particularly from the music which uses a synthetic music. This is a film that is very open to interpretation, particularly the ending.Eastwood does have some ambitious shots for the top, using hand-held cameras to great effect to follow the actions, including during the assault on the town and a quick moment of seeing some shooting in the first person.High Plains Drifter is one a more artistic effort from Eastwood, showing a world of moral greys, being revisionist to the Western genre.

He's quick with guns of several varieties, mowing down three rowdy bar patrons and raping a bystander in the film's uncomfortable opening scene, then settling in to take the surviving villagers for all they're worth when he's hired for protection. As it turns out, the village has a few dirty secrets of its own, and its leaders soon resort to a wide variety of veiled threats and bumbling backstabs to keep them quiet. That leaves absolutely no one in the clear as a moral compass, even the twisted preacher, and the film soon settles in to spinning lazy circles like a rudderless ship. Misogynistic, mean-spirited and narrow, it's not a whole lot of fun to watch beyond a few sporadic action shots and one or two well-placed puns. A far cry from the unspoken atmosphere, dense moral grey area and thick, palpable character of the Spaghetti Westerns that made Clint's name in the mid '60s.",High Plains Drifter
53,jimbo-53-186511,Painting the town red...,4,19 August 2017,"High Plains Drifter is Eastwood's second effort in the director's chair which effectively is a cross between the Magnificent Seven and High Noon. Whilst it starts out well, it sadly doesn't keep this up throughout its running time...Here are the many problems with this film;EASTWOOD'S CHARACTER; he's the stranger with no name in this film and he was also known as the man with no name in Sergio Leone's A Fistful Of Dollars (which I'm sure isn't a coincidence). It's clear that at this point in his career that Eastwood had a fondness of Sergio Leone (and why wouldn't he as Leone clearly made Eastwood a huge star). Whilst this film has the feel of many a Sergio Leone western it certain doesn't have the enjoyment value of many of his Westerns. The truth here is that Eastwood has made his own character far too unlikeable and cruel for me to really care about him; he rapes women and then seemingly has them falling at his feet - Eastwood seems to turn this into some chauvinistic ego-trip; why would these women like him let alone want to sleep with him??? His cruelty to the townsfolk is potentially explained in the context of the story, but a lot of what we see here is quite extreme and doesn't make for a particularly pleasant viewing experience. The issue here is that you want to cheer on Eastwood and the gang and hope that they overcome the returning villains but the problem here is that you can't; why would you want to root for a mean-spirited rapist?? THE STORY; OK; so the gunfighters that the townsfolk originally hired get killed by Eastwood's character so the townsfolk have to rely on Eastwood to protect their town. This bit I was OK with, but then things start to get ridiculous... The townsfolk offer Eastwood a free reign on the town on the assumption that he will defeat the 3 returning villains... although Eastwood's return possibly has supernatural connections to it I still found a lot of the plotting to be rather preposterous and far-fetched. What exactly was the significance of painting the town red? Maybe I missed something here...The female characters are poorly used and seem to exist as little more than play things for Eastwood and pretty much all the acting from the male cast is horrible (with the exception of Eastwood whose tough talking performance through gritted teeth is just about enough to carry the picture)Other than that this is a horrible film where Eastwood seems to use the narrative to set himself up as some kind of supernatural god (albeit of chauvinism and pig-headedness). It's an arrogant, smug and self-indulgent film that lacks much of the likability of many of Eastwood's other westerns.",High Plains Drifter
54,Nazi_Fighter_David,The Man With No Name has returns as an avenging angel of death!,9,21 November 2000,"The exotic location in the desert, near Lake Mono in the California Sierras, certainly gives the film a fresh and refined look among Westerns...The sparkling colors of the backgrounds and the changing cloud formations gave effective shots...The film has certainly the most dramatic opening sequence of any Western... Through the burning desert, Bruce Surtees' lens discovers a lone horseman.... The camera pans with the horseman to reveal a small town by a lake-lagoon... The horseman rides in, the camera tracking behind him, interrupted with faces of suspicious locals - even a coffin maker with his merchandises - and instantly one is reminded of Sergio Leone and his faithful reproduction of Kurosawa... A coach driver cracks the whip... The horseman turns, and moves back... He enters a bar and asks for 'a beer and a bottle.' A town heavy intervenes: 'Flea-bitten range-bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here is a little too quick for them. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us!' The drifter replies: 'I'm faster than you'll ever live to be!'True to his promise, the Stranger kills the 'trouble shooter' and his two friends, and also rapes the town belle who responds as any Eastwood feminine victim is obliged to, with resistance turning strangely to joy... The town midget, Mordecai (Billy Curtis) offers him a cigar inquiring: 'What did you say your name was again?' The hardened Stranger replies: 'I didn't!'The Man With No Name has returned, this time, quite literally, with a vengeance... His dictatorship is flavored with cool humor... The name Billy Borders is mentioned to him...'Don't know the man,' he confesses.'You didn't have much time to,' comes the reply, 'because you shot him yesterday.'When his rape victim, Callie Travers (Mariana Hill) inaccurately empties a pistol at him during his bath, he casually resurfaces, cigar still in his mouth, and in an aside to his sidekick, Mordecai, reflects: 'I wonder what took her so long to get mad?' His fellow chauvinist suggests, 'Maybe because you didn't come back for more.'The townsfolk accedes to the Stranger's requests, who pushes them to the limit, even forcing them to paint the entire town blood red... 'When we get down,' says one of them, 'this place is going to look like hell.'This is the Stranger's intention; he takes a brush and strokes out the name 'Logo' on the town sign and writes 'Hell' instead.In a series of flashbacks, primarily from the Stranger's point of view and later from Mordecai's, it is revealed that the townsfolk stood by and let three men whip their Marshal to death... The Marshal had discovered that the basis of the town's prosperity, a mine, was actually on government land and not on the townspeople's own. He was going to report this, so no-one felt obliged to intervene when he met his vicious end... His body now was lying outside the town in an unmarked grave: 'They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind... he's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.'Now they have reason to be afraid of the three men who paid the price for the crime in which they all agreed... The Stranger analyzes this fear: 'It's what people know about themselves inside that makes them afraid.' The town reaction to his is reserved... A group of vigilantes try to kill him... The Stranger repays them with a stick of dynamite... Despite their training, the remaining locals are horrified when they realize that he does not intend to remain for the final showdown...""High Plains Drifter"" is one of the most important Westerns ever made, and when Eastwood takes his rightful place in film history alongside Cooper and Stewart and Wayne, this is the film that will be seen as the quintessential example of his art...",High Plains Drifter
55,drystyx,Would be better if Pale Rider wasn't so superior to it,1,27 May 2007,"Make no mistake, this and Pale Rider are the same movie. And make no mistake, both movies are about the spirit of a wrongly slain man returning for revenge. This was common knowledge when the movies came out, and only recently have people tried to distort the plots. Makes you wonder if some of the nuttier Eastwood fans actually think he'll return after he dies. We know the answer to that, don't we? This could have been a good story, but the high profile spaghetti influence has just been too powerful, sorry to say, ever since the early sixties. The bullies who want to make westerns unenjoyable really sank their teeth into the making of this one. The lead character has no redeeming quality. Ther is nothing likable about him. And it just cuts the whole story to shreds, since we want to see revenge for a good man dying. We don't care anything about this character. No one cares if his murderers ever see justice. So this story just falls flat. The movie becomes an ordeal. And there is no method in the spirit character's mean streak. It just falls flat. Just meanness for the sake of being another stupid spaghetti western. That is the chief difference between this and the vastly superior PALE RIDER, in which characters are explored and don't look like cartoon stereotypes. These stereotypes are hard to sit through without constant groans. Not the worst of Eastwood, but must be compared to his PALE RIDER any way you slice it, and any way you slice it, PALE RIDER is superior on all levels. There is no way any one can like this movie as much. So rent the other one if you want entertainment, if you want to think, if you want to feel, if you want anything.",High Plains Drifter

Everyone has their favorite Eastwood western ( Unforgiven is my favorite ) , but you really can't go wrong with any of Clint 's westerns in my opinion as they are all great films and classics. Clint is a man with no name , but with supernatural overtones that are left to the viewer to interpret his origin. Within minutes of his arrival to town our un named antihero shoots down some thugs and rapes the town tramp . The town as corrupt and cowardly as they are offer to hire this stranger for his deadly skills as there are dangerous criminals getting out of prison looking for revenge on the town that betrayed them. Clint now has free reign of the town and he paints the town red, makes a midget sheriff and mayor and brings retribution. A traditional western this is not, but this was a great vehicle for Clint and one of my favorites. A decade later Clint made Pale Rider which is similar to this and excellent also.",High Plains Drifter
57,Witchfinder-General-666,"Eastwood Redefines the Antihero, in Dark and Gritty Western",9,20 March 2009,"""High Plains Drifter"" of 1973 is a gritty, dark and exceptional Western which proves that Clint Eastwood is doubtlessly one of the most memorable individuals ever in cinema, both as a brilliant actor and great director. Several years after embodying the Western anti-hero, the 'Man With No Name' in Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollar-trilogy, which culminated in the matchless masterpiece ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" of 1966 (the all-time greatest Western, and, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made), Eastwood reprises the role of the nameless stranger - and creates an antihero incomparably more ruthless than the role he owes his fame to. ""High Plains Drifter"" was Eastwood's second feature-length film as a director. I am not the biggest fan of his debut, the 1971 thriller ""Play Misty For Me"" (which is doubtlessly more than decent, though), and would personally regard ""High Plains Drifter"" as Eastwood's first directorial masterwork. The film is an incredibly dark, gritty and sometimes obscure Western with many elements of a supernatural Thriller. It's protagonist is an antihero with a stress on the 'anti' - ruthless, violent and cold-blooded. It is not surprising that the first Western directed by the most famous star of the Spaghetti Western is also arguably THE American Western which could most easily be mistaken for an Italian one. It were the Italian Westerns which made the Genre gritty and turned its heroes into antiheroes, and ""High Plains Drifter"" epitomizes these aspects.A nameless stranger (Eastwood) comes to a small lakeside town in the West called Lago. By proving his talent as a gunman, he quickly establishes his superiority over the, initially hostile, townspeople, who subsequently ask for his protection against a bunch of outlaws. The stranger is not the kind of person to give away his help out of good will, however...From the first sequence, ""High Plains Drifter"" is incredibly atmospheric. The music, the photography, the setting - it all goes perfectly in hand. The film brilliantly brings up the feeling of a supernatural Thriller with a highly uncanny undertone. Eastwood is brilliant in his role of the nameless stranger, a man more ruthless than the 'Man With No Name' in Leone's films. Then again, he is only ruthless towards the self-satisfied, hypocritical townspeople, who are more or less scumbags themselves - only weaker scumbags, that is. 'The Man With No Name' is arguably the all-time epitome of cinematic coolness. So is this 'Stranger' here, only that he is more aggressive, cynical and violent than Eastwood's earlier role. The rest of the cast is also good, especially worth mentioning are the two female cast members (The Stranger treats the two female characters vastly differently) Verena Bloom and especially Marianna Hill, whose character Callie is 'tought some manners' early in the film. ""High Plains Drifter"" may well be called Eastwood's first masterpiece as a director, and if I don't give it the full rating, it is just due to the superiority of Leone's films (especially ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"") to which it cannot quite compare - but that, no other film can. Overall, ""High Plains Drifter"" is a sublime first Western directed by Clint Eastwood, and along with films like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Unforgiven"" it stands among his greatest directorial works. Not to be missed!",High Plains Drifter
58,AudioFileZ,A Latter Day Western Classic Heavy On Symbolism,8,21 February 2017,"We all conscientiously form initial impressions as to how to process a movie, a book, music, architecture, clothes, or any number of things. When watching the opening sequence of High Plains Drifter I scratched my head a bit and decided this film was going to explore the dark side of human nature. That would include revenge, jealousy, lust, greed, and hypocrisy.The town people of Lago are attempting to live in a kind of a bubble. They desire to ignore as much as possible outside their city. They want a kind of closed utopia even if the bond between the various members in the town is all fake as everyone is out for number one with their only shared desire being keeping a profitable mine open. This was solidified after a earlier visit from some dark men resulted in the murder of the Lago sheriff who knew a dark secret about the mine that could destroy the town. After taking care of the sheriff situation the town decided to hire enforcers for what they couldn't stomach themselves. These men would be the filter keeping outsiders out and, also, to protect them from the same dark men who killed the sheriff as they went to prison unexpectedly which if they ever get out could be a revenge call waiting to happen. Now it's clear we have tenuous line between law and order, moral men and those pretending to be.Clint Eastwood's mysterious character (he isn't even revealing his name) is on the surface as bad as any gun slinging outlaw, but maybe the town can use him to their advantage as in short order the enforcers are all dead and those murderers seeking revenge are thought to be days away from being released from prison (i.e. more commentary on corrupt laws?). Thus a uneasy truce between Eastwood's drifter and the town is born. It's going to be a strange marriage to say the least.The uneasy truce gets more strange and things, naturally, reach a critical mass. The drifter is all about what you reap you sow it would appear as what is left of Lago will have to start over. Perhaps it will be a very different town sans certain hypocrites and a hideous red paint remaining. Lago is a town that won't be the same and that's for sure. The story is the movie and the movie is the story. It's a bit surreal and dreamy at times, but it's a solid western tragedy rooted in the classics. It's the old story of evil vs. good, just not as straightforward and more cryptic thanks to Eastwood's drifter character. A newer classic is the bottom line.",High Plains Drifter
59,RatedVforVinny,"The finest Eastwood, outside of the 'Spaghetti's'.",9,27 June 2019,"Another brilliant Western from one of the best actors/directors, in modern cinematic history. 'High Plains Drifter' remains one of his finest achievements and following on from his directorial debut ('Play Misty For Me'). It's packed full energy, excitement, together with a supernatural twist. You sort of get the feeling that Westerns this good will never be made again and with some of the most quotable lines in the genre. To the ultimate question ""WHO ARE YOU!?"" the hero simply replies right at the end ""You Know"", before riding and disappearing into the sunset. A classic that Eastwood himself, only even to match with 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' and the epic 'Unforgiven'.",High Plains Drifter
60,winner55,"a good film, memorable ""post-Western"" Western",8,30 June 2009,"Play Misty For Me, Eastwood's first feature film as director, pleasantly surprised many critics by avoiding important genre clichés (the obsessed murderess is not a wholly unsympathetic character, for instance), especially those expected from Clint ""Dirty Harry"" Eastwood. High Plains Drifter, his second feature, received respect but not open admiration, since it was after all another Western starring the original ""Man With No Name"" actor as, well, a man with no name. That's too bad, because the film holds up remarkably well and its graces should have been noted on first release.In fact, Eastwood uses this film to develop important technical chops. What struck me, seeing this film again after a few years, right at the beginning, was the use of sound. The rhythm of the horse's hooves, the crack of the whip, the lighting of a cigar, all are technically perfect recordings, brilliantly timed, and used to create an aura of significance.The film is a Western, to be sure, but approached as a Gothic romance. Italy's Spaghetti Western directors had been moving in such a direction for years, but of course, being European, their sense of the Gothic is somewhat different than ours, and their sense of the American West derived from watching motion pictures. This film is both authentically ""Western"" and authentically ""American Gothic"" as well, right down to its implicit Puritan morality.Eastwood is hampered by having on board as cinematographer Bruce Surtees. Surtees started out with Don Segal and it took him several films before he mastered the art of the wide screen lens - his images, in his early work, always look a little flat and more like TV than cinema. That's a pity, because this film cries out for a depth of vision he can't bring to it.There are weaknesses in the script as well; Tidyman was a solid genre screenwriter, but Eastwood recognizes a richness in the story that Tidyman himself misses. For instance, the parallel relationships Eastwood's drifter affects with the two women in the film could have been far more telling and dramatic. Eastwood tries to get the actresses to produce what the script hasn't given them, and he almost succeeds.So it's a good film, a memorable film, but it could have been a great film. As it is, and coming out in 1973, at the very end of the Western genre (and its European Spaghetti equivalent), it is among the first ""post-Western"" Westerns - largely ironic, somewhat surrealistic, but tightly controlled by one of America's most interesting directors of his era.",High Plains Drifter
61,intelearts,12th Review: Deconstructing the Western,10,20 December 2006,"High Plains Drifter looks and feels like a deconstruction of the language of the Western.A brilliant mix of psychological and macabre, and in places even quite bizarre, it is an investigation of what is created when weakness and desire meet the man driven half to madness (Eastwood) yet seems sane: he is pathological, but is he the only standard of true sanity as a protagonist here? Has he truly lost all sense of ethic? He starts here as the archetype of antiutilitariansim: nothing he does is for anyone's benefit if it costs him a moment of care. He is cold, brutal, effective. Yet behind this there is a sense that he has a twisted right on his side. Having being so wronged his revenge is more complex than simply killing: it demands retribution, and retribution demands the whole town pays.More existential than even Once upon A time in the West, or, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly it is about the nihilism and the circle of violence that must be closed.The filming is supremely confident for a second film: real silences and pauses, laugh out loud lines and situations and cold, cold chills: the language of film is expressed explicitly and implicitly. This is the death knell of the Good vs. Bad traditional Western: it is more like Kurosawa's Yojimbo though here the bad guys are few and the townsfolk are by implication as guilty as the rest because they let evil thrive and let it break a good man.Never answering it's own questions: like Lago itself it is a world created in isolation and as such is a unique and powerful testament to Eastwood's continuing expression of the darker psyche of the cost of opening up the cowboy image and getting to a colder, starker, realism that defined 70s films.Compulsive viewing and an important film.",High Plains Drifter
62,DeeNine-2,Not a chick flick,7,10 January 2005,"Obviously this was produced before the age of feminist political 
 correctness. The anti-hero with no name--Clint Eastwood, of course, a 
 throwback to his days making spaghetti westerns in Italy with Sergio 
 Leone--comes riding tall in the saddle down into a valley with a mining 
 town by a lake. (The movie was shot around the Mono Lake area of 
 California.) Particularly effective in this unforgettable opening scene 
 is the music sounding like the high whine of the wind off of the 
 desert. This town would be ""Lago"" later to be renamed ""Hell"" by 
 Eastwood's character who is identified in the titles as ""The Stranger."" 
 The stranger really just wants a shave and a bath and something to 
 drink and eat and place to lay his head for the night. What he gets is 
 a bad time from some roughnecks and a woman (Callie Travers, played by 
 Marianna Hill) who has attraction/avoidance feelings for him. He shoots 
 the three guys and rapes the woman before the movie is twenty minutes 
 old. What I mean by this not being politically correct is that, despite 
 herself, she likes it! That sort of thing is not done in cinema these 
 days. The idea that a woman might be turned on by being raped would not 
 play before today's audiences, nor would a Hollywood producer make such 
 a film.
 
 I won't go any further into the plot but suffice it to say that 
 Eastwood is just beginning to kick tail. It seems that everybody in 
 town is cowardly and without the will to protect themselves from the 
 bad guys, especially the three who just got out of jail and are headed 
 their way. How Eastwood, who directed from a script by Ernest Tidyman 
 (The French Connection [1971]; Shaft [1971] etc.), handles the familiar 
 revenge theme is interesting.
 
 First it is no accident that Eastwood's protagonist is named ""the 
 Stranger."" That is the English title of a famous novel by Albert Camus 
 that surely influenced Eastwood. Camus's stranger is an existential 
 anti-hero, a kind of benign sociopath who really doesn't feel anything 
 for others except as they affect his life. But he is not particularly 
 violent and just lives from one day to the next without any direction 
 or goal. He just ""exists."" Eastwood's stranger does more than just 
 exist. He takes action, and he is very good at it. Indeed, I can't 
 recall a western movie in which a gunman could draw faster or shot 
 straighter, or any movie hero who was less afraid of putting his life 
 on the line. So, in a sense what Eastwood has added to Camus's stranger 
 is Nietzsche's superman. And herein lies, I think, the underpinning of 
 Eastwood's philosophy and his ""message."" Note that the people in the 
 town to a man are cowardly. The only exception is Sarah Belding (Verna 
 Bloom) who, like the aforementioned Callie Travers, can't resist the 
 stranger's forceful charm, and falls in love with him. This somehow 
 inspires her to leave the corrupt town.
 
 Yes, the town, like most of human society is corrupt. And yes the 
 average man in the street is cowardly and without the will to defend 
 himself. It is only the ubermensch, that rare breed celebrated in the 
 works of the German philosopher, who has the skill, the strength and 
 the will to bend events to his liking and to take on those who would 
 use violence to achieve their ends.
 
 So what Eastwood does here in his second directorial effort (following 
 Play Misty for Me, 1971) is to diverge from Leone's formula. While 
 there is some very funny and intentionally ridiculous dialogue in such 
 films as, for example, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), or For a 
 Few Dollars More (1965) or A Fistful of Dollars (1964), there is little 
 that is funny, intentionally or otherwise in High Plains Drifter. 
 Furthermore, whereas Leone just wanted to make a buck and saw that 
 tough-minded heroes or anti-heroes involved in action-filled revenge 
 plots was a good way to do it, Eastwood is interested in also making a 
 philosophic (and perhaps political) statement. We are degenerate, we 
 humans, he is saying, except for those rare individuals who take the 
 law into their own hands, make their own rules, and through superior 
 skill and bravery, make their own luck and create their own reality, as 
 does his stranger.
 
 In this film there is also an element of the supernatural, or so it 
 would appear. The stranger ""sees"" in his head the whipping of a past 
 sheriff of the town. Perhaps it comes from the mind of the dwarf 
 Mordecai (very well played by Billy Curtis, by the way) who witnessed 
 the tortured death while hiding under the saloon. At any rate, the 
 stranger shows that he is just as handy with the whip himself as he is 
 with his six-gun.
 
 By all means see this for an early look at the work of Clint Eastwood 
 as both an actor and a director. You will not be bored I can assure 
 you. But don't invite the girl friend over. If there was ever an 
 anti-""chickflick,"" this is it.",High Plains Drifter
63,dunmore_ego,High Pains Grifter,9,21 April 2008,"Dee Barton's ominous score heralds an angel of death materializing from the high desert haze: Clint Eastwood rides from the blasted plains into the sun-soaked seaside town of Lago, as townsfolk stare through the sandy heat at him atop his dusty horse, clopping steely-eyed down the main street. The Stranger from Leone's spaghettis  reincarnated to rewrite the American West.Within ten minutes, this Stranger has had a beer, gunned down three misfits and raped a woman. Super cool. Super cruel.High Plains Drifter (written by Ernest Tidyman and Dean Riesner) has been called deconstructionist; formulaic, a dark study of the soul and a simple western Exactly what this movie is, only history can judge  one thing is certain: High Plains Drifter is a scorching classic: Clint Eastwood's first true American ""avenger"" film, re-writing the book on the quintessential cowboy; no longer the singing fop or the John Wayne do-gooder; the cowboy was now a sociopath, a recluse, an ""anti"" hero.The second directorial effort by Eastwood (after Play Misty For Me, 1971) is a revolution in film-making. We may well say ""they just don't make 'em like that anymore"" but the fact is: they didn't even make 'em like that back then! Note all the departures from Gene Autry/John Wayne convention: The Stranger is the Cowboy Star of this show, yet his horse is not white, but a dirty mottled appaloosa; he is unshaven, with a dusty longcoat (and he doesn't get any cleaner), he speaks without unclenching his teeth, like he holds all and sundry in utmost contempt (which he does), he doesn't wait for the ""bad guys"" to draw first (he'll shoot 'em in the back, or in the dark, or without warning  as long as he kills them); even his hat was not the usual ""cowboy hat"" with upturned sides, but flat-brimmed; and since when do ""heroes"" rape? The Stranger oozed ""bad guy,"" which is what he would have been in previous movies of this genre. Yet The Stranger is The Hero.Or is he?Though this movie is about a twisted kind of redemption, The Stranger didn't even have the mandatory ""character arc"" that defines every movie about redemption; instead, everyone around The Stranger arced, while he stayed the laconic, stone-hearted, anti-authoritarian maverick. This may be how the term ""anti-hero"" got coined: since it is taken for granted that every hero should have a defining arc and since The Stranger didn't, maybe he was not the hero of the movie, even though we invested our emotions and aspirations in that character. Not that anyone else was the hero. Maybe this movie didn't really have a hero! Who made the rules that every movie should? Hence: ""anti"" hero. (Almost every Eastwood movie featuring a character like The Stranger would boast the same absence of Hero Arc, from then to now.) The Stranger displays such calculated cool in gunning down the misfits that the town sheriff (Walter Barnes, channeling Skipper from Gilligan's Island) begs him to become the town protector against three outlaws who held a vendetta against the town and were on their way to Lago for revenge. In return for his promised protection, The Stranger manipulates the townsfolk into granting him free reign of the town and its resources, then proceeds to twist their panties with his insouciance and raw decisions  tearing down people's barns to make picnic tables, making the town midget the mayor and sheriff; giving over supplies to Native Americans for free, eventually forcing the townsfolk to paint all their buildings red and rename the town ""Hell""  and we realize that The Stranger himself is exacting some kind of revenge on the townsfolk.In the town's dark past, these duplicitous, distrusting townsfolk stood by and watched as their Marshal, Jim Duncan (Clint's actual stand-in, Buddy van Horn), was whipped to death by the three outlaws. Was it coincidence that The Stranger breezed into town at exactly the moment that the outlaws would return? By movie's end NONE of these questions are answered! The cast and crew of this movie would become Clint's long-standing film team: Bruce Surtees (DP), Henry Bumstead (Art Director), James Fargo (assistant director), with a cavalcade of familiar character actors: Dan Vadis, John Quade, William O'Connell, Geoffrey Lewis, Anthony James Mordecai: ""What did you say your name was again?"" The Stranger: ""I didn't."" In unbidden irony, before we can speculate on whether The Stranger is Marshal Jim Duncan's brother, or an avenging spirit, or Jim Duncan himself, he has faded like a wraith back into the high plains haze from whence he came.as The Man With No Name character is made more solid in American Western culture than Leone could ever have imagined.",High Plains Drifter
64,PimpinAinttEasy,An unbelievably violent and dark Western .....,7,8 July 2017,I was completely taken aback by High Plains Drifter. This must be one of the most violent Westerns ever made. There are at least two prolonged scenes of torture. Clint's thoughts on female sexuality seems to mirror that of Charles Bukowski and Norman Mailer. I wonder whether the film created a furore when it first released. I am sure a film with the rape scene would not be made today. At least not in the mainstream.It is a relentlessly bleak Western with occasional moments of fun and scenes of kindness.I liked the small town by the sea. The background score was unremarkable at best. I read that Morricone refused to work with Clint because he feared that Leone would become jealous. This film needed a solid score by Morricone. Which would have taken it to another level.,High Plains Drifter
65,Vomitron_G,"Clint Eastwood as a metaphorical, merciless vengeance-demon from hell",9,1 February 2006,"Last weekend I was in a western mood, so I watched HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and THE WILD BUNCH in a row. Though I might not be the greatest western 'conaisseur', I must say that HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is perhaps my favorite western and possibly one of the best ones out there. It's different, dark and foreboding. And it's a slow tension-builder.The deserted plains during the opening-credits and the atmospheric soundtrack pull you in right away. Almost the entire film takes place in an isolated small town (with only one street), which adds up to the desolate feeling of the movie. Clint Eastwood proves himself a masterful director by unfolding the plot step by step, slowly giving more and more information, and choosing subtle yet original camera angles.I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot. Clint arrives in a town at more or less at the same moment three criminals are released from a far away prison. The town seems to have a dark secret and fears the return of the criminals. So they hire Clint to protect them.Eastwood is simply amazing, and though his character is not really likable, you can't help but respect him. Every single spoken line of his is memorable and injected with grim & black humor. I simple love the way his character is introduced in this film: He enters the town on his horse, buys a beer and a bottle of liquor in the local bar, goes to the barber-shop, kills three bad guys with three shots while having a shave, walks out to the street, grabs the local beauty-queen and rapes her. All this in the first 15 minutes of the movie!!! Eat that, John Wayne!The cool thing is that we know almost nothing about Clint's character, The Stranger, except that he's driven by personal demons of the past. An ingenious move, I'd say, Mr. Eastwood. Though we never know his identity, we do get a big hint at the end about who he might be. The acting of the complete cast is good but Clint steals the show. The three criminals are sadistic, brutal killers (example: driving a wooden stake through someone's throat and laughing at the amount of blood that comes out) and the final showdown at the end is satisfying.So HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER has got a lot of typical western ingredients but in fact isn't your typical western at all. It's different in a dark and violent kinda way with a strange type of protagonist. I saw this movie together with a friend who'd seen more westerns than me already. He was pleasantly surprised by this movie, so that proves my statement that HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is a must see (even if you're not a big western-fan, I might add).",High Plains Drifter

67,FightingWesterner,The Greatest Revenge Story Ever Told,10,7 December 2009,"There's room to argue about whether or not High Plains Drifter is Clint Eastwood's best western. (or film for that matter) My agreement usually depends on what day of the week I'm asked. I will however say that in my opinion this is definitely his greatest stateside western, though I'm sure some people still might disagree.There's certainly the highest amount of revenge ever visited in a film. The first and foremost is that of the outlaws who killed Eastwood (or his brother) and the second more interesting revenge against the town that he humiliates, desecrates, and pretty much destroys in the films fiery, violent climax.Reportedly inspired by the Italian film Django Il Bastardo. This takes the earlier film's exciting premise and wrings out all the story potential and ends up creating a better movie, though the other film is definitely worth checking out.A real standout supporting player is little person Billy Curtis. He really makes the best out of his role as the town's laughing stock whom Eastwood makes mayor and who has a ball watching the whole place taken apart. Interestingly, he got to be the hero and got the girl in the 1935 poverty-row novelty western The Terror Of Tiny Town.",High Plains Drifter
68,hnt_dnl,Perhaps my favorite Clint Eastwood Western!,10,1 September 2009,"HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is one of the most unique Westerns ever! Directed and starring the great Clint Eastwood as a no-named stranger who drifts into town (what else is new!), DRIFTER is Eastwood's first Western that he actually directed, and you can see the influence of the 2 directors who had the most impact on Clint Eastwood's career (Sergio Leone and Don Siegel) in this absorbing, surreal, ominous, satisfying film. DRIFTER is an combination of those director's styles. It has the expansiveness (shot in the desert) and a large cast of diverse characters you'd expect to see in a Leone Western, but also there are a lot of intimate, intense scenes of character interaction that Siegel specialized in. Of course it has showdowns! All of which are expertly filmed by the ever-so-attentive film student Mr. Eastwood! DRIFTER starts out similar to those Eastwood-Leone Westerns with a catchy opening tune (although this one is way more dark than the ones in Leone's films) and it immediately draws you in to the story. Eastwood's no-name character rides into the desert burg Lago and is greeted with instant disdain, contempt, curiosity, and fear by the town residents. The opening tracking shot of Eastwood riding in on his horse with all the townsfolk looking on is film-making at it's best! Each character is introduced with just looks and facial expressions and you can tell what each one is about immediately! The town of Lago had hired 3 killers (led by an appropriately evil Geoffrey Lewis) to whip and beat the town marshal to death. We find this out in a strange dream that Eastwood has. Which begs the question: How did Eastwood's character know about this? He is obviously a stranger since no one in town has ever seen him before and was not there when the marshal was killed (or was he?). This is the big, unanswered question of DRIFTER. Is Eastwood related to the character (brother, perhaps)? Did the spirit of the marshal somehow occupy Eastwood's body and demand revenge? Or he Eastwood a ghost? Never really answered until the end when Eastwood tells the town dwarf Mordecai (memorably played by Billy Curtis), who is putting the headstone on the marshal's grave, that he already knows who he is! And even here we are still not sure! All we know is that Eastwood left town the same way he arrived, like a mirage! Eastwood comes in and takes over the town in exchange for helping them get rid of the 3 killers who have been released from prison (the townsfolk turned on them after the marshal's death and had them put away). This manipulation is reminiscent of A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS where Eastwood played sides against each other, but with a hidden agenda that had nothing to do with money!The excellent cast includes Stefan Gierasch (as the town mayor), Mitchell Ryan (as the local businessman), Walter Barnes (as the town sheriff), Ted Hartley (as the hotel owner), Verna Bloom (as hotelier's wife), Marianna Hill (town slut who Eastwood's character actually rapes early in the film), John Hillerman (as a shoe salesman), and Anthony James (as one of the 3 killers).HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER proves that Eastwood ranks not just among the elite Western directors, but the elite directors period!",High Plains Drifter

In a turn of events this town is about to face a day of atonement and it all becomes clear when Eastwood paints the town red and calls it hell. High Plains Drifter is actually superior to Dirty Harry in some ways. For instance the pace is tighter, it's aged better and indeed features Eastwood at his most charismatic and mean spirited. The way people make a big deal about Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven and Mystic River (Which are good) sadly neglect that this in my opinion will be Eastwood's Oscar for best director. This movie is poetic in its violence and the themes of justice and vengeance are given dimensions that far exceed most westerns. This is a must see and is the highest on my want list for DVD. Speaking of which this movie needs a special edition DVD, it's that special. So see it! * * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",High Plains Drifter
71,johno-21,Lesson to Lago,9,7 March 2006,"There once was a frontier mining town called Lago where all it's residents lived in greed, hypocrisy and fear. The town had a Marshall to keep order but instead of the town backing the law to fight off gunslingers who were skimming money from the mines they figured they would be better off hiring the gunslingers to run the town so they in effect sanctioned the Marshall's death. The town's most prominent prostitute conspired with the gunslingers to rid the town of him. The towns clergy and congregation stood by and did nothing and the mayor and townspeople stood by and watched. The town eventually turned on these three murderers and they got sent to prison and they hired three more gunslingers to take their place. The time came for the three to be released from prison and at the same time a drifter from out of nowhere or maybe just from the nearby the high plains rode into town. A man who went by no name. A gunslinger himself who would dispense a frontier justice of his own to the entire town and befriend only those who the town got a kick out of making fun of. A midget and a couple of Indians. For every other person and in fact every building that stood in the town he had another plan. The three gunslingers on their return to Lago will find that Lago has had a change of administration since their absence and a change of name. Lago is now Hell. Clint Eastwood directs. He would make only three more Westerns in his career in The Outlaw Josey Wales in '76. Pale Rider in '85 and The Unforgiven in '92. Ernest Tidyman who wrote the series of Shaft movies had just come off an Oscar win for his screenplay for The French Connection when he wrote the screenplay for High Plains Drifter. Eastwood had just come off his directorial debut in his acclaimed film Play Misty for Me. This is a surreal film that pays homage to Eastwood mentor Sergio Leone and says good bye to the man with no name character except for in 1985 when Eastwood revived the no name character in a slightly different incarnation as the preacher in Pale Rider. This is a good and different kind of movie and I would give it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.",High Plains Drifter
72,jluis1984,Clint Eastwood's First Masterpiece,9,11 April 2006,"By the early 70s, actor Clint Eastwood's career had gone from being a mere extra to a well-known Hollywood star. Thanks to the success of Sergio Leone's immortal Westerns, Eastwood was noticed and soon he began to work in very good projects, with great results. Despite being a respected actor, nobody could have imagined that his talent as director was even superior to his acting skills, and after a fairly good debut in 1971 (the thriller ""Play Misty for Me""), he crafted his first masterpiece in 1973 as a tribute to his own artistic mentors: the haunting western ""High Plains Drifter"".""High Plains Drifter"" is the story of a small mining town named ""Lago"" which is constantly troubled by outlaws and gunfighters. One day a stranger (Clint Eastwood) comes to town, and manages to kill three of those outlaws, gaining instant recognition and the offer of having whatever he wants from the town if he gets rid of the rest of the gang. He accepts but the town doesn't know that the mysterious stranger has a secret that will change their lives for ever.The figure of the stranger comes to town to alter the fragile equilibrium of their existence, and soon the town's own demons return to haunt them. Eastwood's character is not exactly the hero we know, but a morally ambiguous cruel man that doesn't hesitate to use and abuse the townspeople and that clearly has an agenda of his own. Written by Ernest Tidyman, this is a dark tale that explores the ambiguous morality of people and the concepts of justice and revenge.Eastwood's second directorial effort is a powerful movie that brilliantly combines the elements of Western with those of suspense and thriller. Due to his solid career in Westerns, Eastwood knows the genre's characteristics and pushes them forward to create something more, a movie beyond its genre. With brilliant camera-work, he goes from dream sequences out of a nightmare to day sequences in Leone's Spaghetti Western style. This is definitely a tribute to his mentors (In fact, he included a small reference to his directors in a cemetery scene).The acting is remarkably good, with Eastwood himself leading the cast with great skill and his powerful presence. His character is a lot more complex than his ""Man With No Name"" and it could be said that he mixes in one character the characteristics of the three outlaws of ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"". The underrated Billy Curtis is great as Mordecai, probably the only one in town who knows (and understands) the stranger's secret. The rest of the cast is very good and even those in small roles (such as William O'Connell as the barber) give performances of high quality. Apparently Eastwood's talent with people was there from the beginning.Tidyman's story is very well-constructed, and can be seen from diverse points of view. Every character in town is well-defined no matter how long their screen-time is, and Eastwood makes the most of it. It's hard to find a flaw in this movie and I really can't praise it enough. It is a story that once that grabs you never lets you go.""High Plains Drifter"" is a must-see, not only for Western fans, it is a powerful story that is more than what it seems. Great camera-work, haunting images, terrific script, superb acting, all pieces fit to create Clint Eastwood's first masterpiece. This dark western sets the path of Eastwood's career as a director and one can see why is he one of the best directors alive. 10/10",High Plains Drifter
73,ivo-cobra8,Clint Eastwood's best hell pulse-pounding climax classic western masterpiece!,10,13 February 2016,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a Clint Eastwood's best pulse-pounding western masterpiece film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.High Plains Drifter (1973) is in my opinion Clint Eastwood's best pulse-pounding climax classic western masterpiece! It is my fourth favorite Eastwood western film flick and it is in my top 5 Eastwood western films! I love this movie and it is a tone horror dark western movie. Which is the film that I really believe, is a classic Clint Eastwood's best western! This is Clint Eastwood's second film as a director finds the celebrated action star returning to his familiar Old West stomping grounds and his internationally acclaimed role of ""The Man With No Name."" This time, The Stranger (Eastwood) mysteriously appears out of the heat waves of the desert and rides into the lawless, sin-ridden town of Lago. After making a name for himself with a string of blazing gun battles, The Stranger is hired by the townspeople to provide protection from three ruthless gunmen just out of jail. The Stranger quickly proceeds to paint the entire town bright red, rename it ""Hell,"" and supply divine retribution in the fiery, pulse-pounding climax of this acclaimed western shoot-em-up.Plot: A drifter with no name (Clint Eastwood) wanders into a small town, where his gun-slinging abilities are in high demand. When the drifter rides into Lago, he is met with incredulity and disapproval by the townspeople. But once he shows his skills with a pistol, the locals realize he may be able to help them fend off a band of criminals who have been terrorizing the town. He agrees to help the townspeople, but does so with his own secret agenda.""You're going to look pretty silly with that knife sticking out of your ass."" - Best Clint Eastwood's dialogue lines in the film. I like that this film has a good plot, it is mysterious and scary all the time. The three villainies Geoffrey Lewis, Dan Vadis, Anthony James are scary killers in this film, that no one can touches them, and they kill everything that moves. I love how this film is portrayed and that Eastwood is a mysterious stranger on a revenge against the corrupt, selfishness and greed in the town Lago. The movie is evolving about a murder of marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) who was murdered in the town of Lago from three outlaws and the towns people covered up. Clint Eatswood is probably which I assume Jim Duncan's brother that get's revenge on everyone. I have never seen in any movie the town been painted red and written Hell never. Buddy Van Horn been whipped to death by three outlaws. This film is gruesome, bloody and very violent with a gore and tons of shoot-em-up scenes. It is different than For a Few Dollars More but is still pretty good western flick.Like is said I think for a western flick that Clint Eastwood directed is probably his best western movie he directed. I love this movie to death I love it and it is my third Eastwood favorite western film! After he has killed the three men the locals ask if he will stick around and save them from three convicts who are being released after the town got them to commit a rather heinous crime. Seen in flashback scenes the crime is the brutal murder by whipping of a town Marshall. The problem in the film is actually the rape scene, which is tough to watch and the score is a little dated now. The good is not afraid to try something different and raises more questions than it answers. Engaging story, great performances and plenty of violence/action. You have even one explosion in it, the town is burning up in flames and the mysterious man kills all three outlaws on the same way that they killed Jim Duncan. It's not exactly feel good fare like I said and darker than you'd maybe expect but It's not without a sense of humor and Eastwood expertly directs it, keeping it well paced and relatively short at an hour and 45 minutes long.Overall: I seriously love this film to death! High Plains Drifter is a daring and quite different film with Eastwood not playing a hero type! This film get's a solid 10 by me which everyone of the cast did a solid performance cause I saw the acting been realistic and there are no CGI in this film!

He tries to get a drink at a bar, but three yahoos just won't leave him alone (guess what happens to them). He treats women with utter contempt, but they throw themselves at his feet anyway. He doesn't say very much, won't give out his name... but is a gunfighter par excellence. Welcome to another Clint Eastwood Western.This one is a bit more elaborate than most though. Not only is he taking revenge on the outlaws who whipped him to within an inch of his life, (or possibly killed him, the film leaves that to your imagination) but also the population of a small town which just stood by and let it happen. The various indignities he subjects them to as a price for his help, like forcing all the guests out of a hotel so he can have it all to himself, and having the locals to daub their buildings in red paint while writing on the sign WELCOME TO HELL are hilarious.He smokes his cigars, is nice to Indians and Mexicans, and never looks flustered for one minute. It's impossible not to be drawn to this guy, despite his dubious moral compass. Eastwood directed the film too, and he seems to have learnt a few tricks from his mentor Sergio Leone... such as how to film a tense gunfight and good use of the long shot when necessary. He would go on to helm many more films, and it's obvious why when you see talent like this. Yep, I like it. 7/10",High Plains Drifter
75,Maziun,Cool western with Eastwood,8,6 September 2013,"One of the first Westerns that took a revisionist stance as opposed to the traditional ones of the genre. Clint Eastwood plays here his favorite type of hero – Unnamed stranger . Well , not quite unnamed – the movie makes it kinda open who he is to give it a supernatural feel. The character of Marshal Duncan was played by stuntman Buddy Van Horn, a long-time stunt coordinator for Clint Eastwood, in order to create some ambiguity over whether he and The Stranger are one and the same.The movie itself is rather straightforward revenge movie. It's style over substance , but what style ! Clint Eastwood is the definition of word ""charisma"". He might not be the best actor in the world , but when he's on screen you can't take your eyes of him. ""High plains drifter"" shows us something we can't find in movies anymore – a true manly man , a true star , a true icon. The movie is Eastwood's tour-de-force . He's simply bad ass. Every man fears him , every woman wants to be with him (even if she doesn't want to admit it).I liked Billy Curtis as Mordecai. The other actors are also OK. The direction by Eastwood is solid . It's the first time Clint Eastwood directed one of his Westerns. The scene with whips is actually disturbing and that's a good thing. There are some laughs and nice dialogues . As I said earlier it's a simple revenge movie. More violence than substance , but who said that's necessarily a bad thing ?I give it 8/10.",High Plains Drifter

The men were arrested for the murder of a marshal in Lago; a crime that the town simply stood by and watched. It's never clearly defined, but many get the implication that The Stranger is a reincarnation/ghost of Marshal Duncan. His unprecedented behavior towards the people might support that he has some underlying resentment. This gives the film an ambiguity to it and separates it from other westerns. Its mysterious, perplexing and the possibility of the supernatural make it like something you've never seen before. In support of this anamolous premise is a well done and intriguing execution. Eastwood does a fine job in his first directorial attempt at a western and while he gives it the proper doses of humor as well as tension.High Plains Drifter is a very different film with: a novel concept, first rate jobs from Eastwood both behind and in front of the camera, an eerie score and one of the most intresting design ideas for a set.

79,vampire_hounddog,"Eastwood's first western as director, he clearly has brought with much of the style of the Italian westerns",7,15 December 2020,"One day a stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides into the newly constructed small desert town of Lago. He promises the townfolk that he will defend and rid them of a band of three men who had killed a sheriff (Buddy Van Horn) and give him whatever he wants. He makes a little person (Billy Curtis) the sheriff, trains the townsfolk how to defend themselves and seeks his own unknown punishment on the townsfolk.Eastwood's directorial debut of a western shows he has clearly learnt some lessons from Sergio Leone's Italian westerns and has brought them with him including the almost haunting images of the stranger riding in to town and mysteriously riding out again. Where this has developed is in the almost supernatural element to his character that smartly does not reveal his identity or his connection to the town. It is revionist of the genre, even if it brings many tropes and stylistic qualities of the European western.His look is cool, rough and ready and almost comic book like, cooly handling all comers and using his trademark economy of words. You can almost smell the wood of the newly built town constructed by Lake Mono in the desert of northern California with the sense of the heat and barreness of the locale coming through in Eastwood regular cinematographer Bruce Surtees as the stranger appears in the town through the heat haze.There is also a good deal of character in the supporters and marks the first appearance of Geoffrey Lewis in an Eastwood film, although other than Verna Bloom's character who sees the light, there are few genuinely sympathetic characters. HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is in many respects a simplistic western film that has enough mystery and a good deal of style that carries it through, even if it is perhaps not his best western.",High Plains Drifter
80,RJBurke1942,Where death is the reward for the cowardly,5,3 September 2010,"Vengeance is mine, says Clint Eastwood in this story of retribution set beside a pristine lake somewhere in the old West (actually shot at Mono Lake, California). Here's the pitch: the marshal at the town of Lago is brutally whipped to death by three bad guys while the town's people watch and do nothing to help. The bad guys wind up in jail for a spell, but on the eve of their release, The Stranger (steely-eyed Clint Eastwood) turns up at Lago to have a killer of a town party and paint the town red, literally and figuratively.What follows is a succession of confrontations by the townsfolk with The Stranger who summarily dispatches, sometimes with extreme prejudice, any and all who get in the way of his job: which, quite simply, is to wreak vengeance upon the three miscreants when they return to Lago, and this time, with the enforced help of the cowardly residents.The opening sequence has the The Stranger descending through the heat haze and from the sierra across the undulating plain to the lake shore and Lago, obviously a nod to the opener for Shane (1952); after the dirty deeds are done, director Eastwood pays homage to Shane again, as The Stranger disappears into the heat haze and sierra once again, never to return. Using inter-cuts and recursivity, Eastwood effectively weaves the back-story of the marshal's murder with the unfolding carnage. The finale, while technically interesting – being mostly at night – does not have the force of a story like Shane, for example, and certainly not Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in The West (1968), arguably the best attempt to date to show vengeance and retribution.Eastwood gives his usual stolid performance as a Man With No Name. But most everyone else overacts, of course, the exceptions being a delectable and aloof Verna Bloom – and the horses. Well, this is a fantasy after all, even at the most banal level, so anything goes. For the curious, the epilogue clearly discloses the identity of The Stranger, so I'll leave that morsel for you to discover when you see this movie, which is mainly for Eastwood fans. I wouldn't rank this film in a list of all-time great Westerns, however.The most striking feature is the natural setting, startling in its beauty and an excellent contrast to the dirty little brown town full of dirty little people, the last perhaps being the reason the story fails, ultimately, to deliver any truly worthwhile message: we all know death comes as the end, but none of us would want to identify with any character in that Hell of a town, and certainly not with The Stranger on a pale horse.Maybe that's why, after also doing another story about vengeance with The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Eastwood went on to produce and direct Pale Rider (1985), an unashamed remake of the Shane story, in yet another attempt to get it right? In my opinion, though, not until Unforgiven (1992) did he truly succeed with a story that rivals Shane, and perhaps even trumps it.",High Plains Drifter
81,virek213,Gothic/Supernatural Western,9,10 January 2007,"On his second film both in front of and behind the camera, following the success of PLAY MISTY FOR ME in 1971, Clint Eastwood decided more or less to resurrect the mysterious Man With No Name persona of the spaghetti westerns he made in the 1960s with director Sergio Leone that made him an international star. But in HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, that persona is taken to a whole other level. The end result turned out to be one of the most commercially and artistically successful westerns of the 1970s, and further cemented Eastwood's reputation as a diverse individual both in the acting and directing departments.Eastwood plays the mysterious title character, who rides out of the desert into the town of Lago, situated on Mono Lake at the eastern foot of California's Sierra Nevada. The townsfolk, naturally enough, are deeply suspicious of this guy and his motives, particularly when he begins to take over the town step by step and set neighbor against neighbor. But they have a reason to be suspicious, because they're harboring a dark secret. Only one year before, the town marshal was killed by a trio of outlaws (Geoofrey Lewis; Anthony James; Dan Vadis) hired by the town's mining company in an attempt to keep the marshal silent over operations being done on land that actually belonged to the federal government. The townspeople did virtually nothing to stop it; if anything, they were complicit in the killing.But when word gets out that the outlaws are to be released from jail, intent on taking violent revenge on Lago, the town hires Eastwood as their ""protector"", giving him free reign. Of course, as Eastwood is quick to learn, when it comes down to it, everyone in town is scared by these outlaws, a fact that becomes obvious when, after he has ordered the town painted red and renamed Hell, they let Lewis and his friends all but destroy Lago. But in the end, Eastwood has a surprise for all concerned...including the audience.Although sometimes thought of as a parody of the Man With No Name films, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is more of a Gothic and even supernatural extension of that persona, heightened by elements of black humor, particularly involving the town midget (Billy Curtis) who is basically an outcast of the piece. Much of the supernatural element of the film can be found in the flashbacks to the marshal's murder, in which the connection between Eastwood's character and the marshal is chillingly ambiguous, particularly in the next-to-last shot of the film. Eastwood, as always, is great on both sides of the camera; and his cast includes well-known character actors like Mitchell Ryan, Stefan Gierasch, Robert Donner, John Hillerman, Richard Bull, and Jack Ging. Lewis, who would appear in several more Eastwood films, makes for a thoroughly nasty villain as well.Wisely filmed entirely on location at Mono Lake (the town of Lago was built from scratch, with the buildings fully developed to allow for both interior and exterior shooting), HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER benefits mightily from Bruce Surtees' incredible cinematography and Dee Barton's haunting music score. It is one of the most mysterious films of its genre, and, despite a few objectionable scenes (including a fairly nasty rape), it is among the best, and a prime example of Eastwood's abilities.",High Plains Drifter

Eastwood performs wonderfully in this Western with a darker edge. With his usual stares and lack of emotion or speech he controls the scenes with small movements and looks, conveying more than some actors can do with an entire speech.

Sympathies are thrown from side to side, and at some times without anyone deserving anything more than contempt and hatred. This is a film that pulls many emotions from the audience, taking them on a none too clear path, with even the final conclusions being hinted at and leaving the audience somewhat unclear. A brilliant movie, and a showpiece of the Eastwood career.",High Plains Drifter
86,TheExpatriate700,"Grim, Violent Western with a Surreal Touch",7,9 May 2011,"High Plains Drifter is a difficult movie to characterize, combining graphic violence with a thoughtful, even philosophical approach. The film starts with a worn out Western premise, as a town hires a gunfighter to protect it from vengeful outlaws. However, the film takes an unexpected direction, exploring the corruption of the small town and the concept of retribution.One of the film's most interesting aspects is its subtle critique of the Western hero. At times, the film implicitly condemns the townspeople for needing a hero, rather than standing up for themselves. They get far more than they bargained for in Eastwood's Stranger, a borderline homicidal maniac with a penchant for rape.High Plains Drifter combines the artsy with the action, and delivers more than its share of the violence. It is best appreciated by those with a taste for thoughtful westerns, and can be seen as a prequel to Eastwood's later Unforgiven.",High Plains Drifter
87,emperor_bender,"""When we get to Lago, you can have the mayor's horse, fried or barbecued.""",9,12 March 2009,"Chalk up another great movie for Clint Eastwood.High Plains Drifter is a very strange movie indeed. It is also a little confusing. In fact, it takes a while to fully get whats going on. But I think that is how its supposed to be.The music was really really well placed in the movie. Helped set the tone for a lot of scenes.Clint Eastwood steals the show as The Stranger, a mysterious man who rides into the scared, shady town of Lago and isn't long before he starts kicking everyone around. Geoffrey Lewis plays Stacey Bridges, one of the most cold-hearted bandits I've ever seen on screen. There are also great performances by Verna Bloom, Billy Curtis, Mitch Ryan, Ted Hartley, Jack Ging, Marianna Hill, Paul Brinegar, Robert Donner, and Walter Barnes.The movie is very cold and ruthless: just how a western based on revenge should be. There are many moving scenes. And there are also very comical ones. Eastwood himself is very comical and as always: you can't help but love his character.This is definitely a classic.9/10.",High Plains Drifter
88,chuck-reilly,"""High Plains Drifter"" is one of Eastwood's best",10,1 May 2008,"Reprising his ""Man With No Name"" persona in this film (which he also directed), Clint Eastwood took the standard Western revenge story to new levels. In ""Drifter"", Eastwood is ""The Stranger"" who wanders into the small mining town of Lago to merely have a few drinks and a quick shave and bath. Before too long, he's killed three bad guys and raped the town tramp. The three dead men had been hired by the town to protect the residents from three more rotten fellows heading their way. It soon becomes apparent to viewers that the town is totally corrupt and that they're hiding some very devious prior actions. After first declining their offer, Eastwood's ""Stranger"" reluctantly agrees to defend the town against their three ""enemies."" But the Stranger has a lot of unique ideas on how the townsfolk should prepare themselves for the onslaught and he begins to humiliate and debase them to the nth degree. Of course they richly deserve what's coming to them since they were all complicit in the killing of the former marshal. Seems he discovered that Lago's main mine was actually situated on government property and he was determined to inform the authorities. The greedy and rotten citizens of Lago made sure that he never got the opportunity to do that. Although in the film it's never stated overtly that the Stranger is actually the ghost of the marshal, it's not too difficult to surmise from the audience's standpoint. When all is said and done, ""High Plains Drifter"" is a somewhat mean-spirited movie with few likable characters---but that may be why it's so much fun to watch. There are plenty of not-so-famous people in the film. Old-time western actor Walter Barnes has a field day chewing up the scenery as the cowardly and portly sheriff. Mitchell Ryan is around as the utterly corrupt boss of Lago's mining facilities. Verna Bloom does a credible job playing the only woman in Lago with any sense of decency. Geoffrey Lewis (as Stacy Bridges) does his best to make his character about as worthless and rotten as a human being can possibly be. ""High Plains Drifter"" is grim, unconventional, revisionist, and without one iota of anything remotely connected to Political Correctness. On that basis alone, it deserves the highest rating.",High Plains Drifter
89,LivingDog,Welcome to Hell,8,24 October 2002,"A small town is set upon by a single ""drifter."" The drifter is Clint Eastwood (no name). It turns out that he was the Marshall of this town who was bull-wiped to death while the town just stood by and watched. Now Clint is back to rid the town of the miscreants who plague them.You might think that this is small town, but there are elements which sometimes give the movie a surrealistic effect. E.g. the name of the town is ""Lago"" (lake) but Eastwood renames the town to ""HELL"" and the point hits home when he has the town's people repaint their buildings. It's for the ""party"" at the end.Basically it has overtones of being a western ""The Seventh Seal"" and Clint is leading them all along for the ride. The movie is extremely tight - even to the very last scene.Although I only gave this movie a vote of '8' I very highly recommend it as quintessential Eastwood. It is so good and even though it is now 30 years old (made 1972, it's now 2002) I've seen it more times than I can remember.

92,OldAle1,"Lessons from the masters, well learned in Eastwood's first western as director",9,13 September 2009,"I've been a fairly big Clint Eastwood fan for 20 years - interestingly enough though, I'd only seen this, his second directorial effort and first western as director once, a long time ago. Seeing as how I was going to be re-visiting The Outlaw Josey Wales for a film club though, now was as good a time as any for a re-watch.The plot couldn't be simpler, in many ways harking back to ""A Fistful of Dollars"" in its elegant, stripped storyline: A stranger (Clint) rides into the town of Lago, quickly getting into a shootout that he didn't start and besting the three gunfighters that the town had hired to protect them. The townspeople are afraid of another trio who had once been on the payroll also, doing time in prison for a crime committed a year before that the town is complicit in, and due back to wreak vengeance. Seeing as how their protectors are dead, they agree to hire the stranger at any cost, and he proceeds to wreak havoc on the town in more ways than one before proceeding on his way after filling his bargain in apocalyptic fashion.If the plot's simple, the characters, style and symbolism of the piece are a little less so. The Stranger it seems is haunted by dreams - memories or visions, who can say for sure? of a man who seems to be him, the town's former marshall, whipped to death by those same three men riding back for their own vengeance. ""Lago"" means ""lake"" and the town sits on an unnamed body of water; the town seems brand-new, most of the buildings are still under construction and unpainted, though from what we learn it's been around for over a year; the townspeople are greedy and cowardly, and The Stranger is cold, merciless, in the end even demonic. Is he a figure of vengeance, a revenant or demon sent from the real Hell that he names the town after, and that the marshall is seen in one flashback as damning it to, as he orders it painted completely red before the killers arrive in town? Though nearly everybody in the town is unpleasant, a couple of more positive images do stand out - Verna Bloom in one of the two significant female roles is the hotel-keeper's wife, who seems at first to despise The Stranger but seemingly just because he's another brutal bastard - when she realizes that he's the only man in the town with guts she softens, and he beds her just before the showdown. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), is also treated more softly, with The Stranger proclaiming him sheriff and mayor, pumping him up to the point where he alone of all the townsmen shows any guts at the eventual gun battle. I suppose it could be said that Clint's vengeful figure is capable of some charity and feeling towards the only two positive and ""good"" characters in the film. Significantly enough the other female character, a single woman (perhaps a whore? it's never very clear) named Callie (Marianna Hill) who he rapes shortly after entering town, develops an ambiguous love-hate attitude towards him and it's left quite ambiguous as to how much has to do with the rape (which both The Stranger and other townspeople deny) or because he then ignores her for the most part, even after she betrays him at one point.A town that seemed promising and new, fresh and full of vitality at the beginning of the film, perched on a cool lake and apparently prosperous, at the end has been half-burnt and decimated through a supernatural wrath, a vengeance for the greed and cowardice that killed a marshall and cowers before his redeemer - this is old-Testament film-making of a pure kind that Eastwood never really returned to in such an obvious way. There are certainly obvious odes to his spaghetti years, in the dirt and violence and unpleasantness of the townspeople and their souls, in Dee Barton's wonderfully eclectic, eerie score and of course in Eastwood's character; I also think it shares some kinship with the Don Siegel-directed Civil War film The Beguiled from 1971, another film with more than a touch of the supernatural, and few redeeming characters. But Clint makes it his own through the economy and his refusal to make things any more flashy or outré than the screenplay calls for (which is plenty). The cast is terrific, mostly made up of names that were second-tier at best at the time and are largely forgotten now. Bloom and Curtis are especially good Perhaps not one of the very best 70s westerns, and I'd certainly still put it behind ""Josey Wales"" and ""Unforgiven"" in Eastwood's western-ography, but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.",High Plains Drifter
93,Panamint,"Worthwhile, but a dark experiment in film-making..........",6,26 July 2007,"If you are expecting anything other than a dark, downbeat film-making experiment from Clint in this one, you should forget those expectations and approach it from a different viewpoint, or at least an open mind. To me this movie is the screen equivalent of a Walter Sickert painting, which I realize is a hard-nosed critique, but not a bad connotation from a talent standpoint. Everyone agrees that Sickert was a great painter and his downbeat ugly paintings are interesting studies, but do you really want to look at them? Like Sickert, Clint is artistically first-rate here, but due to the style of the movie parts of it are ugly. As in Sickert paintings, Clint has deliberately avoided inclusion of anything positive, upbeat, or humorous here other than as a cruel joke or a smirk. Does Clint here display the work of a budding genius filmmaker, or is ""High Plains Drifter"" just a mean, ugly waste of time? You must decide for yourself.In my opinion this is a well-made film and a worthwhile addition to the enigmatic world of film experimentation. One saving grace in its overall concept is that the protagonist's motivation is apparently revenge-driven, rather than cruelty for cruelty's sake.",High Plains Drifter

95,daniewhite-1,Whipping pained Eastwood,6,10 May 2020,"Clint Eastwood made an odd second feature as a director/star with 'High Plains Drifter' in 1973 after 'Play Misty For Me'.It is stylised like the spaghetti western sub-genre that was both immensely popular and influential in the mid to late 60's, while lingered on a while in the early 70's, and provided Eastwood with his big break.The ""man with no name"" anti-hero character, duplicitous townsfolk, low morality and sardonic sense of humour are all present along with harsher violence and sex.But, really this film is not a western, or a revisionist western or a spaghetti western homage; it's actually a ghost story and semi horror film set in a historical reference that seems to appeal to Eastwood because of it's surface associations with his most identified film roles.The films score and sound design, plus it's visual treatment of Eastwood's character leave little doubt that 'High Plains Drifter' is a supernatural horror in keeping with 'The Omen' and 'Halloween' and 'Don't Look Now' etc.As such it is fairly successful. Another area that it brings to mind are Japanese horror films such as 'Kuroneko' and parts of more literary ghost stories such as Dickens' 'The Signalman'. The similar tone and themes to such Japanese horrors is interesting as the earliest wave of spaghetti western, starring Clint Eastwood, were based on certain Kurosawa films. Even more interesting being the fact that Kurosawa himself, when making his influencial films, had a great interest in John Ford westerns and Shakespeare's Gothic plays.Overall therefore I have to give a positive 6/10 ""good"" rating but with my emphasis being on the ghostly aspects rather than the overt western elements. I can't really rate much higher because 'High Plains Drifter' doesn't quite convince me that it works as well as it could have, mainly because it is too arch and reserved with it's characters which prevents any sympathetic development in it's drama, whether that is action, character, or supernatural.Also the simple revenge western and man with no name plot and narrative that underlines this interpretation isn't well enough developed to carry the film all the way through due to the obscuring of it's narrative logic by the demands of fitting it to a restless wronged spirit ghost story.I would recommend to fans of this 70's period in horror films, particularly to fans of the films I referenced previously. For general fans I think that this film can be obtuse and emotionally barren to watch.",High Plains Drifter

The majority of the cast is good, I just thought that Marianna Hill's performance was really over the top throught almost the entire movie. There are some really cool scenes, Clint Eastwood character is the definition of ""badass"" for almost the entire film, the soundtrack is simple, but very good too. The script is good, even though some dialogues sound weird some times. Well, I think that probably my main issue with the filme would be ""why he did all shity things with the folks down there?"", e some weird shit to, like painting all the houses with red, wtf? Buuut, ate the end, for me, was clear that Clint character was something related to the dead guy (Jim Duncan), some mystical thing, like the ghost of the dead man, his soul or something like that, and, with that in mind, this previous issue of mine, doesn't apply anymore, so, it's ok, everything makes sense at the end.In short, High Plains Drifter is a great western, isn't a long filme, so is easy to watch, and have that old school cinema felling that (unless for me) is always great to feel.8,5/10",High Plains Drifter

99,garyldibert,Not Bad and Not real good,5,16 February 2014,"TITLE: High Plains Drifter is a 1973 American Western film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood and produced by Robert Daley for The Malpaso Company and Universal Studios. Eastwood plays a mysterious gunfighter hired by the residents of a corrupt frontier mining town to defend them against a group of criminals. The film was influenced by the work of Eastwood's two major collaborators, film directors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. The film was shot on location on the shores of Mono Lake, California. The screenplay was written by Ernest Tidyman, who also wrote the novelization. Dee Barton provided the eerie film score. The film was critically acclaimed at the time of its initial release and still is, holding a score of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. Directed by Clint Eastwood, Produced by Robert Daley, Written by Ernest Tidyman RELEASE DATES: August 22, 1973 RUNNING TIME: 105 minutesSTARRING: Clint Eastwood as The Stranger, Verna Bloom as Sarah Belding, Mariana Hill as Callie Travers, Billy Curtis as Mordecai, Mitchell Ryan as Dave Drake, Jack Ging as Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as Mayor Jason Hobart, Ted Hartley as Lewis Belding, William O'Connell as the Barber, and Geoffrey Lewis as Stacey Bridge SUMMARY: A stranger on horseback rides into the mining town of Lago. Three gun-toting men follow him into the saloon, taunting him. When they follow him to the barbershop and threaten him, the Stranger shoots and kills all three of them. Impressed with this performance, a dwarf named Mordecai, who works in the barbershop, befriends the Stranger. An attractive woman named Callie Travers bumps into the Stranger in the street on purpose, insults, and badgers him. When she slaps his cigar from his mouth, he drags her into the livery stable and rapes her. Next, he rents a room at the hotel. That night, he dreams about a man being brutally whipped. It is revealed later that Marshal Jim Duncan was whipped to death by gunfighters Stacey Bridges, Dan Carlin, and Cole Carlin while the people of Lago looked on. Only Sarah Belding, wife of hotelier Lewis Belding, attempted to rescue him. A corrupt faction in Lago wanted Duncan dead; as the Marshal discovered that the town's mine is on government ground, (the townsfolk feared that this news, if reported, would result in the mine being closed, which would threaten the town's livelihood). Sheriff Sam Shaw tells the Stranger he will not be charged for killing the three men. Meanwhile, the townsmen discuss Bridges and the Carlin brothers, who are due to be released from prison that day. The town double-crossed the three gunfighters after they killed Duncan, and the men are expected to seek vengeance. Since the men slain by the Stranger were the mining company's new protectors, the townsmen decide to hire the Stranger as their replacement. Presenting the offer to the Stranger, Shaw explains that the three gunfighters were caught stealing gold from the mining company, although he admits the gold was poorly protected. The Stranger declines the job until Shaw tells him he can have anything he wants. Accepting these terms, the Stranger indulges in the town's goods and services, and makes Mordecai both sheriff and mayor. He also has Belding's clients moved out of the hotel, dismantles Belding's barn in order to make picnic benches, has the entire town painted red, and paints the word ""HELL"" on the ""LAGO"" sign just outside of town. While the Stranger trains the townspeople to defend themselves, Bridges and the Carlin brothers are released from prison and make their way to Lago. They begin on foot but kill three men and take their horses. A group of townsfolk tries to ambush the Stranger in the hotel, but he kills all but one of them. After Belding inadvertently divulges his complicity in the attack, (which left the hotel destroyed), the Stranger drags Sarah Belding into their room, and she sleeps with him willingly. The next morning, Sarah tells the Stranger about Duncan's murder, and how Duncan was buried in an unmarked grave. She remarks, ""They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind."" QUESTIONS: Why did the Stranger ride out of town the next morning? Who did the Stranger fine? What color did the people paint the town? What happen when the gunfighters hit town? MY THOUGHTS: To me this movie was kind of had a very slow pace to it. You knew the climax long before it happen which made this movie boring. I thought that Clint Eastwood did great in his role as the Stranger. However, there was no one backing him up. The other thing missing in this movie was a leading lady. There really wasn't any actress that stood out in this movie. To me you can't have a good movie without a leading lady.

102,bushtony,Hell of a film...,10,16 December 2012,"Clint Eastwood's allegorical western is a genre classic. At the time of its release it was unlike any other western that had come before it. And it remains one of the best films ever made in that genre to this very day.The plot is simple and set in a gorgeously stark lakeside location. A stranger (Eastwood) passing through the mining town of Lago stops for refreshment and is almost immediately provoked into killing three hired guns. He is then accosted by the town bike and proceeds to rape her in a stable for her rudeness. Not your average travelling salesman then.The townsfolk of Lago were previously complicit in the murder of the town sheriff. He was killed by a trio of mining company employed hoods. They whipped him to death in the street. These three killers were then framed for theft by the townspeople and conveniently imprisoned. Bad news is they have just been released from the pen and are heading back to town with payback on their minds.The townsfolk, noting the stranger's prowess with a gun and his mercenary attitude to life in general, ask him to help defend them from the returning thugs. In return he can have anything he wants. And that's a big mistake. He agrees the deal and sets about teaching them a lesson they will never forget.The set-up is simple, but within this straightforward framework resides a complex and multi-layered allegorical fable about morality, sin, cowardice, greed, hell, revenge and redemption. This is not your typical horse opera, no sir.People who have seen the film are all, to some degree, hung up on the question of the stranger's identity. There are several possibilities and theories.He's the Devil. This is based on his almost supernatural ability to avoid certain death and the scene in which he refuses to help the townsfolk until they offer him anything he wants. The suggestion being that this is the key moment when they have willingly sold him their souls, and he is then free to take them to hell. One character points out: ""This couldn't be any worse if the devil himself had ridden into Lago.""He could be an avenging angel on a mission to teach the sinful populace of the town a lesson.Or, he is the restless spirit of Jim Duncan, the murdered sheriff, returning in another guise to take revenge against the town and the men who killed him. The stranger has dreams of Duncan's death. Some critics point to the closing scenes when Eastwood is leaving town and the midget Mordecai, who is putting a name on the sheriff's grave marker states: ""I never did know your name..."" to which the stranger replies: ""Yes you do"". As Eastwood rides away, the camera pans to the name of the sheriff on the grave marker.Perhaps he is really just a footloose traveller passing through who, by a twist of fate, gets caught up in events and everything else is just smoke and mirrors. ""I was just riding through looking for a drink and a hot bath.""The identity of the stranger doesn't really matter. It is never specified but the script provides plenty of clues and cues to generate speculation and it is therefore in the eye of the beholder. You pay your money, you take your choice. Deliberately left open to interpretation. Me, I like the Satan idea, and sometimes I think that's the most likely interpretation. Then I watch it again and I'm pretty much sold on the ghost of the dead sheriff idea. It varies.Whoever or whatever the stranger is, his actions are more significant – he rides into Lago, he clearly has an agenda – whether that is ultimately pre-defined or off the cuff. His mission is to mess with them, show them the error of their ways and orchestrate punishment. That's what he does and then he's gone. Like a ghost, melting into the heat haze as he rides into the distance in the closing scenes.How he rolls is, he makes the local midget the sheriff and the mayor. Takes serious advantage of the offer of anything he wants; has them paint the town red (Preacher: ""You can't mean the church?"" Stranger: ""I mean especially the church.""). He changes the name of the town from Lago to Hell. Then he deserts them to the mercies of the vengeful killers, later returning in a night of flame, whiplash, gunfire and reckoning to wipe out the bad guys; finally leaving Lago a chastened and ruined husk that either needs to be reconstructed or abandoned.Reasons why you should watch it? It's provocative, stimulating, intriguing and a fabulous example of the creative invention going on in American mainstream cinema in the early seventies. The violent action still has the power to shock even now and it is directed by Eastwood with the skill and flair of a major creative talent. He extends the western mythology re-envisioned by the likes of Leone and Peckinpah and elevates it to another level. The screenplay by Ernest (Shaft) Tidyman is blackly humorous, laconic and smart, littered with some classic Eastwood one-liners, and there is not a single dud performance from the very accomplished cast. Great atmospheric score from Dee Barton and haunting cinematography by Bruce Surtees. Even if you don't like westerns, watch it for the sheer thrill of being reminded why cinema is an art form.The creativity and quality on show is something you won't see replicated in Hollywood movies today. Amazing what could once be achieved back when no one had even imagined CGI could ever exist. And if they had and considered the implications, they wouldn't want it to.",High Plains Drifter
103,possumopossum,Clint Eastwood--Heir Apparent to Sergio Leone,8,24 July 2007,"It's evident in this film anyway. He has the Leone close-ups, the long silences, the dark, brutal stories, the nameless stranger. The only difference between them is Clint doesn't take as long to say what he wants to say.Clint reprises his man with no name roll in this his first western film as a director. WARNING! MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD. He is not a ghost. The marshal who was whipped to death doesn't even look like him. In fact, he's played by long time Clint Eastwood associate Buddy van Horn, who directed DEAD POOL and worked with Eastwood in a number of other movies, namely the EVERY WHICH WAY...ANY WHICH WAY movies. My beef about this movie is that if they wanted to give the audience the impression that Clint Eastwood was the ghost of this dead sheriff, they shouldn't have gotten such clear shots of his (Van Horn's) face. His face should have been hidden in shadow, by the gathering crowd, or maybe the camera should have shot him from a distance. But this is a good, intriguing story, and you still wonder just who this stranger is. An avenging angel possibly? Who knows? He sure knew how to mete out perfect justice, not only to the gunmen who whipped the marshal to death, but also to the town itself for showing such despicable cowardice.

104,eastbergholt2002,Supernatural Western,9,27 January 2007,"Clint Eastwood plays the ""The Stranger"" a man with no name who is sent to punish the people of a small mining town for their wickedness. The film is like an Old Testament version of High Noon. It's smart and one of my favorite films of the 1970s.The Stranger arrives in Lago on a pale horse and stops at the saloon for a drink. Three bored gunslingers try to provoke him into a fight, but he ignores them. Later, while sitting in a barbershop they make their move and he kills them. The Stranger is then insulted by a young woman (Marianna Hill) and he takes her off to a barn and rapes her. She seems to enjoy the experience. The townspeople have a problem. They conspired with three outlaws to kill Jim Duncan, the town marshal. The outlaws have been released from prison and blame their incarceration on Lago. The Stranger is hired to provide protection which he does at a price. The Stranger has regular flashbacks in which three men with large bull whips slowly kill a man in the streets of Lago. It becomes apparent that the victim is the dead marshal. Speculation on the identity of the Stranger is the main puzzle of the movie, he intuitively knows the town's history and treats everyone with contempt. This works because the people of the town are cowardly, corrupt and loathsome. By 1973, American Westerns, especially those starring John Wayne, had become tired, sentimental and predictable. High Plains Drifter was about crime and punishment and The Stranger was brutal and unpleasant. It was a different type of Western. Director, Eastwood used the West as backdrop for the action, but it could have been set in any time or place. The film has a quasi-religious aspect. In the Book of Revelation, Death rides a pale horse and Hell follows with him. This a great movie.",High Plains Drifter

The stranger agrees before setting himself up as a king amongst the townsfolk, who are unaware of the dark surprise he has in store for them. The townspeople soon find themselves turning against one another and tensions reach boiling point after some of their number try to kill the stranger. Meanwhile the three outlaws are fast approaching Lago, but why does the stranger bear an eerie resemblance to the town's sheriff whom they brutally whipped to death in the town's street a year previous...Clint Eastwood's second foray into directing(after the chilling Play Misty For Me), High Plains Drifter is a ghoulishly symbolic nightmare with pinches of extramundane mysticism. Despite being gorgeously existential, the movie is an ode to the Dollars trilogy and it is evident that Clint drew a lot on his association with Sergio Leone, which is why I define High Plains Drifter as a pseudo-spaghetti western. Clint was awesome as the nameless stranger, playing the part with the awe-striking, cool-headed professionalism that he crafted so masterfully as the Man With No Name. Unlike most (American) westerns, High Plains Drifter has no heroes, just villains. Let me begin by saying that the film is beautifully metaphoric in it's depiction of guilt. It is a study of the our ""dark side"" as individuals and the conscience that terrifies us so when we do something wrong, the voice in our heads that keeps us awake at night warning us that someday, we'll get what we deserve. Even those of us who claim to fear nothing at least fear their own conscience and this is cleverly represented in the movie. The stranger is this immortal being whose unyielding objective is to punish the people of Lago(and the three outlaws)for their wrongdoing. It transpires that the locals hired the trio of killers to viciously whip the stranger(formally the sheriff of Lago, Jim Duncan)to death a year before after he found that their mine was on government property. Anyway, on the surface the stranger symbolises the severe guilt felt by the townsfolk for condoning this heinous act. The three outlaws are also symbols of this burden carried by the locals as they went to prison for committing out the murder and thus are seeking violent retribution on the people upon their release. The stranger's arrival in the town highlights the sins of the townsfolk returning to haunt them, as does the outlaw's climatic attack on Lago. On the other hand, the townsfolk symbolise the evil of ordinary people who may appear righteous but deep down, are repulsively corrupt. This is an evil that indeed doesn't go unnoticed and will be dealt with, as is the case in the film. Many will make of the film's symbolism differently, but that's just my ten pence worth. High Plains Drifter featured top notch performances all round. Verna Bloom and Marianna Hill were both fantastic, as was Geoffrey Lewis as the savage Bridges. Jack Ging also gave a furiously engaging performance.Thanks to the intelligent script, High Plains Drifter has a dazzling aroma of deliciously morbid humour about it. I always like to see piercing cynicism displayed in a movie and this film has plenty of it. The cinematography was stunning with the shots of the town and surrounding lake glistening in the sun. The shots of the towering stranger standing against the backdrop of the burning town near the end of the movie added a hellish atmosphere to the film's already macabre surroundings and the psychedelic musical score intensified the surrealism.High Plains Drifter is like a revenge themed spaghetti western, albeit with disquieting imagery and grisly absurdism thrown in. Ironically, it conveys an ultimately compelling moral message. 9/10.",High Plains Drifter
106,ereinion,Darkest Eastwood western,9,6 June 2007,"""High Plains Drifter"" is probably Clint Eastwood's darkest western and that says quite a bit. It has similarities with ""Pale Rider"", his other western gem. The hero is a mysterious, ghost-like figure and he fights against the evil and corruption that infests a small town in the middle of nowhere. What sets these two films apart is that here Eastwood is fighting a lone battle , and his only sidekick is the midget Mordecai, while almost all other inhabitants of Lago are corrupted or/and cowardly.Eastwood delivers one of his strongest performances here and manages to be charming and humorous besides exacting cool-blooded vengeance. His interactions with the two women (Marianna Hill and Verna Bloom, both solid in their roles) who are very different draws comparisons to his earlier film ""Hang 'Em High"". But what sets this apart from the typical Eastwood fare is the dark nature of this movie. Anthony James, the man with the unforgettable face, is once again back as one of the main villains. The rest of the cast are quite forgettable and lesser known names, which adds credibility to this movie, making it a film to be taken seriously and not just a gathering of famous faces.This film's perhaps strongest asset is the excellent screenplay by Ernest Tidyman, the Oscar-winner for ""French Connection"" and it is probably the best screenplay ever written for an Eastwood-directed western. The storyline never ceases to surprise and is full of suspense and great dialogue. As always, Clint knew who to pick. As always in the Clint films, this movie is not about love. Clint and Bloom's affair almost results in love, but it never gets the chance to develop. The surprise ending adds a great touch. This film really is a delight for fans of Clint Eastwood and unusual, film-noirish westerns.",High Plains Drifter
107,TheNabOwnzz,An audacious mixing of the supernatural & the traditional,9,19 December 2018,"High Plains Drifter is one of director ( And ofcourse legendary actor ) Clint Eastwood's first motion pictures, and definitely builds the foundations of his future success superbly.Eastwood manages to put himself on the map immediately with this picture, as it dares to take many risks which could have easily turned out very badly. In a time when immorality in westerns (Especially Hollywood ones) was frowned upon, he manages to create this fantastic picture in which every single character is a corrupt, immoral & spineless individual. Not to mention the fact that there is also a significant supernatural layer covering this story, creating an atmosphere that feels like a mix between unsettling horror & a standard western.From the very first shots of the Stranger emerging out of nowhere from a mirage, to him moving down to the town of Lago on a pale horse (Which is a metaphor for death), we are immediately thrown into the mystery of the origins of his character, and his later indifference towards killing three men harassing him further fuels the mysterious nature of this character. Dee Barton's score also mixes ambient noises reminiscent of horror movies with a more uplifting sound which is more reminiscent of the traditional western, which perfectly captures the dual atmosphere this film tries to reach.Eastwood also fills up the film with a lot of well-developed characters, who are given defining characteristics. Ofcourse, all of them still have in common that they are immoral and crooked, but every single character is corrupted in their own way. There's obviously not a lot of relatability with these characters, but one has to remember that this is a picture about immorality, and the Stranger's character symbolizes the Angel of Death exacting vengeance over them for their sins, as a superb metaphorical experience. The plot structure is also consequently fascinating, as a combination of flashback sequences tell the previous story in itself. High Plains Drifter is exceptionally great in this regard, as it manages to balance the fine line between ambiguity and coherence perfectly. In the end, there still is a lot of mystery as to who or what the Stranger is, but the subtle hints and the cohesive narration beforehand make sure that nothing feels pretentious or abstract.Bruce Surtees's cinematography is stunningly beautiful, with fantastic combinations of close-ups and widescreen shots which are obviously reminiscent of Eastwood's former master Sergio Leone. Particularly the night time sequences ( Especially the final one ) are aesthetically superb. There is a consequent reel of beautiful images created by Surtees's photography, and Eastwood's direction only enhances the poetic meaning of this. (A shot of the Stranger whipping one of the bandits with a raging fire in the background is a prime example of the visual expertise at work. )In the end, High Plains Drifter is bold in its theme and story, visually beautiful, metaphorically deep, well acted & well scored, paving the way in showcasing the exceptional directional talents of Eastwood.",High Plains Drifter
108,gottogorunning,Is Clint Bad Or Good? Both,8,13 August 2005,High Plains Drifter(1972) is Clint Eastwood's tribute to the Speghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone. In fact this film can be seen as an American Speghetti Western. High Plains Drifter is a Western-Noir because most of the cast of characters(even the hero) is not a clear cut hero. Clint Eastwood gives a good performance balancing between hero and villain. This was done as a homage to his mentor Sergio Leone who played a important role in his directorial career.This film is better than Unforgiven(1992) because the main character is a man of a more vengeful and brutal nature. This is of Eastwood's early masterpieces as director. One of the best scenes is when he has the whole town painted red and renames it hell. Clint Eastwood would play a ghost again in Pale Rider but without the same viciousness he displays in High Plains Drifter(1972). This will be known to movie buffs as the film where Clint Eastwood rapes someone.,High Plains Drifter
109,jofitz27,Classic Western,10,20 August 2005,"Nothing really, at least in my opinion, matches an old Clint Eastwood western. You know what to expect; violent interludes, smart talking and of course, smart shooting. Well, it's back to basics here: Sombre, yet good guy Clint, is a drifter, who ""happens"" to stumble across a small little town in the west that, surprisingly, (for those times) knows very little about guns, or self defence. So, it's a blessing from God when gun-smart Eastwood comes in, teaches them how to defend, and in reward for his efforts, gets anything he wants on the house. But, cleverly, as well as helping them, he exposes them, for the nasty, brutish, greedy people they really are. In his mind (unkown to the rest) he's only there to kill off the three guys who bull whipped the ""Marshal"" to death all that time ago. Brilliant. That's the word that pretty much correctly describes this piece of cinema. It's brutal, ugly work, venturing further into the horrible times of the west- but it's a clever, groundbreaking piece of cinema nevertheless. **** out of **** (4 out of 4)",High Plains Drifter
110,muons,"slow, boring and ugly",2,15 June 2018,"If I didn't see the director's name, I'd think this is another Sergio Leone movie, but after having starred in quite a few of them, no wonder C. Eastwood's first directing project is heavily influenced by his master's style. I write this review after seeing this movie maybe the fourth or fifth time. Not that I like it a lot but I stumble upon it on tv channels and not having anything better to do I sit and ask myself what the heck this is about every time. The movie opens with a stranger riding into a sleepy western town. After the usual scuffle with the local troublemakers, he kills three of them with indemnity and rapes a woman who harasses him on the street for no apparent reason. Then, the story drags on in a similar irrational fashion.One thing is clear that the movie is all about hate and vengeance. There's not a single likable character including the would-be protagonist. Indeed there's no real character at all but all caricatures of evil. The plot is ludicrously unrealistic. Almost everything goes against the logic and nothing makes sense. The raped women hug the aggressor with lust after a few seconds (apparently, Eastwood thinks he has an irresistible charm even as a raper); the whole town shakes in terror against three men, etc. The whole project looks more like Eastwood tried to parody the previous spaghetti westerns but without humor. Indeed, there are some attempts for humor, like the midget's appointment as a sheriff, the three villains being fed with their horses in prison, etc. but they are all bland. To top it all, the pace is crawling and the whole story is plain boring.Perhaps, the worst comes at the end, when the anti-hero explains why he acted so obnoxiously throughout the story. Apparently, he thinks his reasoning is enough to vindicate his rape and murders; and expects a belated blessing for his actions. What a puerile finale...",High Plains Drifter
111,filmbuff-36,Highly influential tale of revenge,8,30 July 1999,"Probably the most controversial film on Clint Eastwood's resume, so much that even John Wayne said he would never do a film with the man after viewing this.Provocative film that centers around a mysterious stranger that rides into town one day, and turns out to be the ghost of the town's sheriff that the town folk had killed. He ends up seeking revenge on them as well as the gang that whipped him death.The movie is very dark and moody like film noir, and the haunting music score will run chills up and down your spine. It's obvious that the ""coming back from the dead to get revenge on the gang that killed you"" theme in the film also inspired later movies such as ""RoboCop"", ""Dark Man"" and even ""The Crow"".Overall, a dark decent into mankind's soul that will keep you thinking for hours after the movie had ended",High Plains Drifter

In fact, the identity was cleverly written for the viewer to discern.  The fact that I am still bambuzzled is a compliment to the intent of the writers.Succinctly, upon my last viewing of this film, my opinions of the anti-hero alternated from being an angel of mercy, to the devil himself, or in the alternative, the simple mortal brother of the  slain lawman.I believe this was the true aim of the writers to leave a giant question mark as to the identity of Clint Eastwood's character.

There are more expensive productions today, there are green screens and anything could be made, but I've hardly seen anything as effective as this.

115,dorotka24,Atypical genre dish,9,11 January 2008,"Wow, this film certainly defies categorization. It is most certainly a Western, but unlike any I have seen before or since. Among the most unique takes on the genre I've ever seen.This is a revenge opus extraordinaire, in the vein of Odysseus or Hamlet in it's deliberation. And like Hamlet, there is a supernatural theme here, albeit one that does not just appear in the beginning but develops into a crescendo over the course of the movie.Clint Eastwood stars as a mysterious drifter that wanders into a town, seemingly no different than any other stranger that might pass through. BEGIN SPOILER: This is no ordinary stranger, but a revenant, one returned from the grave to work his vengeance upon those who had wronged him in life. Of course, the townspeople don't know this, and all save one never really come to that realization. The stranger is not only identical to the marshall that the townspeople idly watched being murdered by vicious desperadoes, but is one in the same. It is perhaps a message by the director of the tendency for people to distance themselves from others and to avoid getting involved, especially in times of great peril. Is it not then ironic that no one even recognizes the man that was once the law in their town? One among many oddities is that the avenging angel, if you will, is quite solid and looks like any other living, breathing human being. END SPOILER Another unusual aspect of High Plains Drifter, especially for a Western, is that no character in the film is very likable - all have their character flaws and there is no one to truly root for. Few of them are really despicable, but none are really great. Any looking for ""realism"" in film should scream in exuberance for this one, then, since it's a pretty accurate summation of human character - most of us are flawed in some way, with only a few that are really bad.As for the movie itself, there aren't many flaws to speak of. It is certainly unusual and unlike any other Western, but that's good. Most of the characters were almost over the top cowardly, but that was a central theme to the film and certainly made sense. Few are willing to risk their necks if there's a better alternative. And the protagonist had few redeeming qualities, even when we finally understand the rationale behind his cold and deceitful behavior.In the end, High Plains Drifter was an unorthodox, odd sort of film that rubbed me the right way. I don't believe it will ever grow tiresome.",High Plains Drifter
116,NpMoviez,A good - not great - but a good Western movie.,8,7 April 2020,"Clint Eastwood became a star starring in Westerns, so it wasn't new to see him in this role. But being his second directorial movie, and his first Western, he worked quite safe, just doing what he learnt working as an actor in previous Westerns, especially ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964).The opening sequence is a homage to (and not a bland ripoff of) the opening of A Fistful of Dollars. In fact, the entire movie uses the template of A Fistful of Dollars, but in a really loose manner. It's not really one of the greatest Westerns ever, it's very good though. The story unfolds quite interestingly, and Eastwood has always been great when is an eye squinting badass. His badass-ery and the dynamics between him and the characters elevated the material quite a bit. The movie doesn't feel quite ambitious, in fact, it feels kinda amateur compared to later Westerns, like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976) and ""Unforgiven"" (1992), Eastwood directed. Everything felt pretty okay, until the final twist elevated the movie a bit more. It wasn't a Se7en or Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense kind of twist, but was good enough to make the things we watched look better in the end.
The thing that was kind of stuck in my head was that the musical score in this movie and Eastwood's character - a mysterious messiah whose origins are unknown - were kinda ""in you face"" Dollars Trilogy reminiscence. Every Western before and after Sergio Leone's four absolutely great Westerns are bound to compared to the said four films. And, in my opinion, none of them are anywhere near those films. So, the music not being original isn't an issue, it could've been a little less obvious though.

117,cdale-41392,No What You're Expecting,8,8 June 2019,"So, this is a .... Supernatural Horror Comedy Western?""High Plains Drifter"" is a really odd film with an ambiguous ending open to many interpretations.The Basics: A mysterious stranger happens upon the small town of Lago, a settlement beside a lake somewhere out west. All he wants is a drink, a shave, and a bath, but the three amateur bad-asses hired to protect the town make him feel unwelcome so he shoots them. The townspeople recognize that this mysterious stranger is The Ultimate Bad-Ass and convince him to stay and protect them from a trio of nasty guys who hold a grudge against the town and are being released from prison soon.But it's actually much weirder than that.It looks like a pretty standard Western, but the music tells you this is a supernatural horror. There are moments of levity followed by very uncomfortable scenes of a brutal rape that goes on and on and on (and the victim ends up enjoying herself). There's also an intense murder scene where three men whip the town's previous Sheriff to death in the middle of the street, and it also goes on and on and on.It's all very well done and entertaining if you like oddball movies (like I do). My only real complaint is that the town looked like a movie set. It didn't look lived in at all. There weren't enough homes to account for everyone, and some of the business buildings were ridiculously small. It was set way too close to the water, and there was no plant life anywhere around the settlement.Or was that all on purpose? It certainly adds to the dreamlike / nightmarish atmosphere of the film.In any case it's well worth watching.",High Plains Drifter
118,ramsfan,My Favorite Clint Eastwood Western,10,18 January 2010,"While other Clint Eastwood westerns have received more fanfare (The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven come to mind), this is my favorite of them all. This most certainly isn't your Daddy's traditional John Wayne fare, and those expecting to see as such will be surely disappointed or at the very least surprised. Eastwood made a name for himself in the 60's as the ""Man With no Name"" in several Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, and he continues this anti-hero character in 1973's High Plains Drifter, a dark revenge fantasy many viewers (mistakenly) think has supernatural elements to it.Eastwood rides into the town of Lago and immediately guns down three ""troubleshooters"" who goad him into a fight. We quickly find out the dead men had been hired to protect the town from three other criminals who are due to get out of a territorial prison and seek revenge on those in Lago who had been responsible for their imprisonment. Realizing he is their best chance to save the town and themselves from impending destruction, several town leaders unsuccessfully seek his help. After initially refusing their request, Eastwood relents when he is promised ""anything he wants"" in exchange for his services. Throughout the film he takes full advantage of the town's offer through humiliating requests, outrageous demands and inconveniencing its many residents- while ostensibly setting up an ambush for the arriving criminals.We find out through a recurring dream that former sheriff Jim Duncan was whipped to death in the center of town while cowardly townspeople watched and refused to help. Eastwood's arrival is no accident: it is implied much later in the film (and by Eastwood himself off camera) that he is the brother of the dead sheriff out to seek justice, thus explaining his no-nonsense demeanor and harsh treatment of the townspeople.We root for the Eastwood character not because he is a genuinely good person but because everyone in town is either crooked (the mining officials), gutless (bartender, barber, sheriff) or simply unable to stand up for themselves (the women, the midget). We revel in Eastwood's actions simply because everyone else receives their just comeuppance. This film is well acted, well paced and entertaining. Present are many fine character actors- Mitchell Ryan, Stefan Gierasch, Walter Barnes, Geoffrey Lewis, and many others- who all lend to the enjoyment of the film.

120,rockymark-30974,That's why it's called aesthetics,2,17 July 2021,"The field of criticism is called aesthetics for a reason. It's based on feelings and reasons for them. I was reluctant to review this film and even added an extra star in my rating for fear I would be considered an outlier. Yet every opinion, if sincerely submitted, should be recognized.I cannot see a reason for a film like this. It is pure, ridiculous fantasy. Many of Eastwood's films, at least his Westerns, are. The cop films, many directed by Don Siegel at least have a co-efficient of adversity that makes the scenes satisfactory. One takes please in watching Dirty Harry take control of a sleazy bunch in a brothel/massage parlor. Even though one knows that Eastwood's Harry is invincible, the narrative makes his antics plausible But that's true of John Wayne's movies too, or any hero in a film. The narrative is ""a job of work"" that makes the heroics of the protagonist satisfying to a viewer.But a film like this has absolutely no coefficient of adversity at all. Even Superman in the TV series starring George Reeves seems more vulnerable than this Drifter does. So what's the point besides bang! Bang! Bang!Most of the scenes are pathetically predictable. Like who doesn't know, viewing other Eastwood Westerns, that, in the opening scene, Eastwood doesn't have a gun beneath the shroud as he sits in the barber's chair when several bullies arrive? And who is surprised to find that he's not sleeping in his bed when a gang ""welcomes"" him to the city by beating on an empty bed?I just don't get films like this. Some scenes, such as the flagellation scene, stretches credulity and are unnecessarily violent for no apparent reason. Okay, we get it: a guy was whipped. But wouldn't 2-3 lashes make the same point? Compare the scene in Burt Lancaster's *The Kentuckian*.A reader who might think I'm squeamish about violence or operatic violence in movies in general should be informed that I am very fond of the Sergio Leone Westerns. But there violence had a point. The scenes were brilliantly filmed and even though of course one knows the Eastwood character would always prevail (but then most heroes do) there is still a sense of probability that he might not.Frankly, aesthetically it's difficult to pinpoint the exact difference, such as in The Terminator films, which to me are aesthetically satisfying, even though the Terminator is invincible as well.Of course I can pinpoint the difference and the comment was mainly rhetorical. It's the phrase I used in the beginning of this review: a job of work.One feels an effort to get the hero from one heroic moment to the next that I just don't see in this and some other Eastwood Westerns. The writer/director collaborate in a job of work to create friction in the movement. One might almost rhyme it as friction = fiction. There is no fiction in movies like this.But then, if one could isolate the key factor one would be a genius. As the record producer says, ""If I knew what makes a hit record I would be a millionaire."" But I think that ""job of work,"" ""co-efficient of resistance,"" narrativity, and ""friction"" come close. Another word is ""interiority."" If one is aware of interior conflict in the hero, no matter how superhuman his feats are, they still sound plausible. Compare Sanjuro in Kurosawa's *Yojimbo"" or the later *Sanjuro*. There is no ""interiority"" in this film at all. No sense of characterization. They're all cardboard figures being pulled through their motions.",High Plains Drifter

122,ikizdevran-882-254684,They'd never forget the day he drifted in town.,8,11 July 2018,"""High Plains Drifter"" is a typical Western revenge film directed by Clint Eastwood. It is one of the earliest examples of Clint Eastwood as a director. He is also in the leading role as The Stranger. From the very beginning of the film, you get to understand the road it is going to follow. The Stranger rides into a sweet mining town near the sea called Lago. There is no talking in the first 6 minutes of the film. When he rides into the town, everybody watches him, and this is when we get to know a little bit the small town and its fearful people. During the first scenes you get to understand why Clint Eastwood has always been the symbol of masculinity in cinema. The character Clint Eastwood plays has a certain style that doesn't fail him. The same coolness of his characters in his other films is still here in the ""High Plains Drifter"". In Lago, people go on with their usual lives, but this sweet small town holds a terrible secret. Once upon a time, there was a marshal in this town and, when he finds out that the mine belongs to the government, he goes ahead and tries to reveal this secret. Three gunmen, hired by the townspeople, whip the marshal to death and the secret is hidden forever. When the film progresses, we get to understand that The Stranger is somehow related to the murdered marshal, and comes to this small town to take this revenge. Everything signals us that The Stranger is the ghost of the murdered marshal, Jim Duncan.It is said that ""High Plains Drifter"" is influenced by the works of film directors like Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. You see a lot of similarities between Eastwood's character in the ""High Plains Drifter"" and The Dollars Trilogy or in the films he worked with Don Siegel. Made in 1973, ""High Plains Drifter"" remains popular even today and represents one of the finest examples of the Western genre. This film is one of the best start points if you want to get familiar with Clint Eastwood's directing style. It hides its secret until the very last moment and reveals everything with its last scene. When the film opens with The Stranger killing three men and rapes a woman, I had no idea what was going on, but with the story developing, everything starts to make sense. He gets all the buildings painted in red and changes the name of the town from Lago to Hell for a reason which is held hidden until the very last scene.In order to understand the story, you need to pay attention to everything, because there are some scenes that reveal the truth about the revenge The Stranger comes to take. It is a very well made iconic film. Maybe the camera angles and the set don't create the necessary credibility, but overall image of the film is brilliant. Soundtracks keep the audience alert at all times and they fit the overall atmosphere of the film. Regarding the set, it is too obvious that it was recently built. In some scenes, camera angles are really bad and fails to focus on the bigger picture. In my opinion if camera was paying a little bit more attention to the reactions of people around, it would have helped to create a more credible atmosphere for the film. Other than the set, filming location is beautiful. Personally, I am sorry to see that this beautiful town of Lago is destroyed in the end of the film for good reason.""High Plains Drifter"" is a one-man film, but I can't say Eastwood's acting alone was enough for this film to be considered as a classic. The story behind justifies his reactions during the film. That's why both acting and the story are equally important and can't be separated. Even though before ""High Plains Drifter"", Clint Eastwood had this style, with this film he steps up and shows his talent as a director as well. All these years his contributions to cinema both as an actor and as a director can't be denied. Thanks to his early films like this one, he built a reputation and remained active until the present day. ""High Plains Drifter"" is a highly personalized Clint Eastwood film with a runtime of 105 minutes. Even though you are not a fan of Western, to understand the progression of Clint Eastwood, you need to watch this film.",High Plains Drifter
123,dcshanno,Simply okay,5,24 November 2004,"Eastwood had obviously picked up a thing or two from Sergio Leone, and it shows in this bleak, violent, and absurd Western. But whereas Leone's 'Man with No Name' was a likable purveyor of death and vengeance, Eastwood's 'The Stranger' is so menacing and cruel that he's rendered completely unsympathetic from the get go. While I enjoyed some of the film's more surreal moments (painting the town red and the apocalyptic finale), Eastwood goes too far in trying not to take his character seriously and turns him into a nearly cartoonish comic book figure. When he tosses the dynamite into the hotel room and then guns everybody down, about the only thing missing was a 'Yippee-ki-yay, motherf*cker' or 'I'll be back' type quip.I'm sure there are those who prefer action over art and gritty realism over style, but I'll take 'A Fistful of Dollars' over 'High Plains Drifter' any day.",High Plains Drifter

In my opinion, he is not the dead Marshall's brother because he knows to much about his death but wasn't present. So that leaves us with the concept of a supernatural figure, either an avenging angel or the ghost of the Marshall but reincarnate in a form that is not recognisable.It is my opinion he is the ghost of the dead Marshall, forced to live in purgatory until he extracts revenge on the people who murdered him and allowed him to be murdered, and did not have the decency to provide him with a gravestone. There is a line in the movie spoken by Sarah Belding to the effect that 'they say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind'. And of course the Marshall's grave is indeed unmarked. We also suspect that Sarah might know who the Stranger is and why he is there and this could be a reason as to why she leaves the town.So the Stranger consigns the townsfolk and his killers to a very real version of hell while rectifying the issue of his own headstone which will allow him to finally rest in peace. At the end, as the Stranger leaves, he sees Mordecai the dwarf chiselling the name of the dead Marshall on the gravestone. Mordecai repeats an earlier line 'what did you say your name was ?'. The Stranger nods to the marker and replies 'you already know'.Well that is my interpretation which works for me but the neat thing about this movie is that the identity of the Stranger is an open question which different audiences might interpret as they choose.It is also a darn good shoot-em-up western as well filmed in a surreal setting.",High Plains Drifter
125,lucifer,A superb western,10,17 April 2001,"As is often the case with a Clint Eastwood western, High Plains Drifter is rather good.The usual scenario opens, with Eastwood (playing an unnamed character again) riding into a small mining town, Lagos, where a small group of thugs unsuccessfully try to kill him.This small act serves as an introduction to the local townsfolk: small-minded cowards who are all talk and no action. They also bear a horrifying secret.Eastwood is eventually approached to help them fend off an upcoming attack from three criminals who have just been released from prison.He also suffers from a recurring nightmare, which I will leave to you to find out.Needless to say, all of the pieces come together by the end, and those of you not astute enough to have noticed will be saying, ""of course!""A good story combines with Eastwood's anti-heroic personality (he never really played a good guy, did he?) and a good supporting cast to produce one of the best westerns of the 1970s. As the Maltin summary states: ""Half-serious, half tongue-in-cheek, with great role for midget Billy Curtis.""Curtis plays Mortecai, the town dwarf, who shadows Eastwood around Lagos. Some of the scenes in this are extremely funny, but are balanced by some harshly violent moments, of which Eastwood's nightmares are a prime example.1985's Pale Rider bears similarity to High Plains Drifter in certain areas, but you'll have to watch that yourself to find out where.",High Plains Drifter
126,Akash_Menon,A chilling western...,9,9 April 2020,"Rating: 9Clint Eastwood's second movie as a director is nothing shorter than awe. This is a Western movie which can be described as dark, supernatural and psychological. It is more than just a classic Eastwood film which revolves around a Stranger walking in town, being a badass and saving the day. In the earlier scenes you realize what The Stranger can be. He walks into the town unknown, drinks, rapes and is a straight outlaw. The ending of the movie is the reason why it's a top rated movie. The Stranger turns out to be the reincarnation of the slain Marshal whose sole agenda was to make the town *pay* and take vengeance on his killers. He is good to the only person in town who is the *runt* among the sinister humans. The anointed Marshal's duty was to serve the people and they never came to his aid. The Stranger walks off when the Bridges gang arrives and the people need his aid. He comes in the end when the town is literally in flames, like *HELL* and takes vengeance upon his killers. In the end he reveals himself, to the good-willed Mordecai.The Good - Brilliant storyline. In the beginning you do not side with Eastwood's character . As the movie progresses, you sympathize with him and see the reality of the sinister townsfolk.The Bad - I could not find anything bad in the movie as the ending of the movie exterminates all flaws that could possibly arise. Brilliant storyline, action scenes, acting and cinematography.This dark western is a must watch movie. Eastwood not only credited himself as being an adept actor, but even as a director.",High Plains Drifter

And that's my problem. Not Clint Eastwood fault it was a time where no meant yes. A time where men were supposed to stand for themselves protect their property.

In High Plains Drifter, he is the nameless guy who rides into town one fine day. Clint clearly has issues in this movie. Repressed angst? The result of a traumatic childhood? Who knows. He's antisocial and can't stand the townspeople - a feeling that is emphatically returned. When push comes to shove there's a whole lotta shovin' and he finds himself training the other men for an upcoming assault by a group of revenge-seeking desperadoes. Is Clint Eastwood a ghost?

132,RHKLWK,A Classic Morality Play,9,20 May 2003,"First, I do not see this film as a continuation of the Sergio Leone films, which were ""high opera.""  The spaghetti western trilogy told simple stories, and had simple, tidy endings.  This film is a character study, and it requires multiple viewings to absorb its nuances.  And as for an ending? Pick one.I agree with those who find similarities in this film and in ""Unforgiven,"" a film that did not work for me.  This film, however, worked for me on many levels.Who exactly is Eastwood's character (the ""stranger"")?  It isn't clear, but there are many clues, and the answer to the riddle keeps us returning to the film time after time.  There is something between Eastwood's character and Verna Bloom's character. What is it?  What does she know about the stranger?  It's hard to say. She, herself, is a very eerie presence.Billy, who plays ""Mordecai,"" nearly steals this film.  Interestingly, he played the mayor of the Munchkins in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  The sheriff is superb, and so is the barber (who shows up again in ""The Outlaw Josie Wales"" as the ferry operator).  Where does Eastwood find these people?
I thought the three ""bad"" guys were miscast.  Geoffrey Lewis does not come across as a psychopath to me.  On the other hand, I was happy to see that one of his buddies was the creepy guy who worked at the diner in ""In the Heat of the Night.""  He could have played Norman Bates. 
It would have been better if the three gunslingers at the beginning of the film -- really bad looking dudes -- had switched roles with the three ""bad"" guys at the end of the film.This is a very stylish, if violent, movie, and the fact that it is a western is superfluous to the story it tells.  In exposing the dark underbelly of the small town, the film reminds one of ""Blue Velvet,"" which followed years later. This film isn't for everybody.  One wonders if Eastwood deliberately made ""The Outlaw Josie Wales"" three years later to reassure fans that he could still make a traditional western.  In fact, as a traditional western, ""Josie"" ranks with ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""Shane,"" and ""Red River.""  This film is not for traditionalists.  It is a challenge for many.  But, it pays off in so many ways, and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10.",High Plains Drifter
133,stephen-scott83,The Greatest of it's genre!!!,10,16 January 2013,"High Plains Drifter is the zenith of it's genre. I don't know if anyone can aptly put into words the level of genius and perfection this movie has. I have watched HPD so many times that I know almost every line in the move - from ALL the characters. I think HPD is the single greatest violent western of all-time - better than even The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. It is certainly my favorite western ever and the reasons are these; the setting (Mono Lake in California) is visually stunning with the town built just for the movie. The music is so eerie and foreboding - it's mesmerizing! The character development is simply outstanding. William O'Connell who played the Barber, and John Quade who played the Freight Wagon Operator are two of my favorite actors. The facial expressions that O'Connell makes and his ultra nervous mannerisms ( shaking like a leaf when attempting to shave Clint!) are simply brilliant, brilliant acting that cannot be matched. Mariana Hill who plays Callie Travers is excellent as the town floozie. Clint's side-kick Geoffrey Lewis is at his menacing best! Robert Donner the Preacher, is astounding. His line, ""I'm just a simple man of God"" is said with a lilt and depth that you have to hear. Everyone in this epic classic is amazing - everyone. The script is perfect in my opinion. The plot of the movie centers on Sheriff Jim Duncan who is bull-whipped to death after we learn he discovered the Lago Mine was on government property. The townsfolk, convinced he was going to reveal this to the authorities have the 3 hired thugs do this dirty deed. Only Verna Blooms character, Sarah Belding tries in vain to help Sheriff Duncan. The man who never reveals his name rides into town and in no short order he has raped the town floozie and dispatched 3 thugs who the town fathers hired to ward off the now jailed Stacy Bridges and Carlin Brothers - who murdered the Sheriff - disturbed him while trying to get a bath and shave. Mayhem ensues when Stacy & the Carlin brothers return to Lago to seek revenge for being railroaded by the moral corrupt towns folk. A fascinating case study of right and wrong, morals and justice. I do not have enough superlatives to bestow upon this movie. I watch it at least 2 - 3 times a month. There is an element of psychology in the movie that relates to Clint's character and the dearly departed Sheriff. Is he the Sheriffs brother or is he the Sheriff reincarnated? This is up to each viewer to make their own decision . This movie is 10/10 perfection. See it. Buy it. Love it. Forever.",High Plains Drifter

As one of the characters in the movie states, ""Without a headstone, the dead roam (paraphrase)."" Marshall Duncan was set up and murdered due to the greed of the town leaders and businesses. And the townspeople did nothing to stop or help. They, in the eyes of Marshall Duncan, are all guilty to some degree. Those that don't like the movie decry the violence and rape and thuggery of Clint. Well, it was because they were being punished for either their active participation in Marshall Duncan's murder, or their passive allowance of it.

The town has the men but they lack the masculine strength to defend their territory and families. The movie is much better, but it has that Rambo thing going--one man against the world. I'm telling ya, this Bonanza episode had to influence the movie...way too similar. I am just hanging out today watching TVLand and this episode was on.

142,Crispin-3,Dark western transcends its plot,8,15 June 2007,"This movie is like a dark reflection of some of Eastwood's earlier Westerns. I hadn't meant to watch it but was soon caught by the dark, complex atmosphere with its suggestion of the supernatural. The plot if summarized briefly would differ little from Shane or the Magnificent Seven (or even Cat Ballou!), but the devil, as they say, is in the details.There is also, surprisingly, plenty of black humour here. While much of it depends on sight gags, there is also much subtle satire of Western clichés not excluding Eastwood's own performances. Some of the in-jokes are summarized in the trivia. The opening and closing scenes of a lone rider on a vast plain, shot with long telephoto so he hardly seems to move against the heat-shimmering foreground, is reminiscent of the famous scene in Lawrence of Arabia.The characters are almost all ""bad and ugly"", including the anti-hero Stranger himself. However there is enough sense of appropriate retribution and redemption to keep the movie from descending into the merely negative and bizarre.The chief danger of a movie directed by the star is self-indulgence. That was my first impression, and my initial rating reflected this; but on reflection I think Eastwood fully intended the irony of the classic poster-like Eastwoodian frames, and I raised it to an 8. I am not an Eastwood fan as such, but I believe he has made a fine contribution to the canon. Well worth watching.",High Plains Drifter
143,clint-cole,Drift Somewhere Else,1,16 December 2005,"This is one of three movies to ever receive the '1' rating from me. Many reviews written by people are either 1 or 10, nowhere in between. Most people either like a film or don't, period. I am not one of those. My life is movies. I watch all kinds, and give them the rating they deserve.Now then... What the hell are you thinking Clint Eastwood? Where's the artistic talent? Maybe it was there but I was so appalled by the rape scene I missed it.. Rape can be a very antagonizing element when added properly to a film. This instance served no purpose. Also I kept falling asleep during the scene where the whole town (all 11 of them) are shooting at a dummy on a wagon for like half an hour.The problem with this movie is the choice of events to progress the plot. They seem tasteless and make the plot drag rather than keep interest. Western lovers will love this because it's a western. If, however, you love a good movie for all the reasons that make a movie good, avoid this one at all costs.Mystic River was also directed by Clint Eastwood and it sucks for the same reason this one does. Some people never change. Way to go! Another movie of his (Blood Work) had some pretty gross scenes and just focused on how decrepit he was, not to mention it was as predictable as the taste of celery.Clint Eastwood needs to schedule a luncheon with Spielberg, Tarentino, or Sam Mendes and maybe beg them for a few pointers.Dude, Clint, you don't deserve my name.

Everything lit into hazy gold by the scorching sun. The dust, unsettling and disturbed. In the distance,a blurred horseman is riding towards the screen, slowly taking form. He is The Stranger, a man with no name, a drifter with no past and no apparent purpose but to seek retribution for the sins of the people in the town of Lago.Thus opens Clint Eastwood's first directorial effort in the genre that made his legend.. A stranger rides into the town of Lago, his pale horse and his bestubbled face attracting the curious and worried glances of the townspeople. The stranger's horse moving at a slow sinister gait. He stops and dismounts to enter a saloon.. he asks for a drink, only to be taunted by a bored gunman:"" Flea-bitten range-bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here is a little too quick for them. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us...""the stranger, laconic and cool..replies:""I'm faster than you'll ever live to be....""A little later, the stranger kills the pompous gunman and his two cohorts. Just minutes after, he meets the town beauty with a sharp tongue and punishes her by raping her inside a barn in broad daylight.He is now the most feared man in Lago.He then checks in at the town hotel, the man at the desk asks him to register and give his name, but the stranger won't, leaving us in utter bewilderment even more as to the identity of this man. The townspeople too, are perplexed. As the stranger lies down on the bed, a flashback dissolves onto the screen, showing a man, who turns out to be their former Marshal Jim Duncan, down on all fours, being whipped to death by three men. The townsfolk looking on, indifferent to the fate and the pathetic cries of help from their OWN marshal. Moments before the marshal's death, he cursed: ""Damn You ALL People To HELL""...With this flashback, we know that The Stranger is connected in some way to the marshal, whose death was caused or at least permitted by the townspeople, but the key question is How? With Clint Eastwood purposely depriving us (Genius!) of a clear connection between the Stranger and the Marshal (i.e. He refused to give his name in the Hotel, they could be brothers) interpretations of character of The Stranger spring to mind. The Stranger could be the personification of the town's collective shame and guilt that had long been consuming their souls. He is the manifestation of a life that is beset with fear,.. and of SINS.When three outlaws are released from prison and plan to make the town of Lago pay for their lost time, the townspeople, consumed by fear, turn to The Stranger for protection, in exchange for ANYTHING the Stranger wants.Just as Fear corrupts a person's dignity, so does The Stranger as he moves around town getting his hoggish share of ""freebies"" from the town's merchants. Leather and goods, food and shelter (having the whole Hotel emptied for him to shack in).These atrocities, strangely enough, seemed ineffective in soliciting sympathy for the townspeople because they are portrayed as cowards, selfish and undignified.The Stranger prepares the town for battle but will he stay to help them? or will he leave these deplorable people to fend for themselves? DO COWARDS DESERVE PROTECTION? These questions, reminiscent in a way of Snyder's essay ""A Nation of Cowards"" are put forth by the movie, but in the ending,. The Stranger did protect the town, but only after the town had suffered a great deal did he step in.High Plains Drifter is a metaphysical western, it is intelligent, rich thematically but very entertaining and even funny. It might not be the best Eastwood western but it certainly has the distinction of being the most unique.",High Plains Drifter

146,mrdestroyer2001,Revenge of a stranger without a name,7,30 April 2019,"The classic picture, shot by Clint Eastwood, who himself played the main role of a stranger without a name. For me, this picture is certainly not the pinnacle of creativity, directorial and acting, the inimitable K. Eastwood, he just has a lot more work to do. But the film definitely deserves to be seen by many.At first glance, it seems nothing new as regards westerns, having taken it in view, the viewer will not see. But it will be so only when viewing the first half of the picture. In the future, all the actions taking place in the film will acquire a raid of mysticism, which will intensify from one action to another and acquiring clear outlines of the supernatural with the development of the storyline. The fact that a stranger appears and disappears in the end of the tape will obviously hint at the mystical interpretation of the picture. And Eastwood himself hinted at the mystical aspect of his work in his interviews. Therefore, this tape will also be interesting to those who love not only the standard work in this genre. It will definitely appeal to lovers of the mysterious and mysterious.In the picture itself, by and large, there is nothing to complain about. Everything in it is made to last. It could not be otherwise. Just look at the team working on the film. Here there are only one professional and aurochs of their business, who set and put into practice more than one picture of this genre. Separately, I would like to mention two people, I don't take Clint Eastwood a priori into account, because everything is clear with him, he is a pro in his field, especially as regards Westerns. First of all, I note the operator Bruce Surtis, who has done an amazing job. His camera is fascinating, he showed a small town in all its glory, the viewer sees it in full view. At the right moment, he pulls out close-ups, thereby creating a lot of stress. The locations that B.Sertes shows are pleasing to the eye, they are amazing. Here, an important factor plays the role of the place where the place was chosen for filming, the endless plains, the scorching sun, the small town. The viewer will see the wild west in all its glory, against which a bloody spectacle will unfold. And the second is noted by composer Dee Burton, who wrote beautiful and very beautiful music for this film. Of course this is not Ennio Morricone. If you compare with it, many composers immediately fade away, so for me, a comparison here with the greatest meter of their work will not be appropriate. And therefore Dee Barton created classical music for this western. For me, this composer stands on a par with the great L. Bokalov.Shootings, for which they love this genre, there is not much. But without them, the film has something to see. Perfectly written out all the characters without exception. Whether major or minor. Each will play an important role, regardless of the time interval occupied in the tape. And be sure everyone here will be rewarded according to merit. The picture does not sag, it was interesting to watch the development of events throughout its entire length, the well-written script clearly contributes to that.The output was a harsh and merciless picture, seasoned with a touch of humor and irony, like many other works of this genre by C. Eastwood. But it may seem ambiguous to many people, so of course, it's your decision to look or not.",High Plains Drifter

I prefer this film to ""Unforgiven"" and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" by far.It's ambiguous, eerie, cliché, violent and politically incorrect.

Those of us who love the Western will never pass up a chance to watch it in reruns. This was a Western that pulls no punches and all of the characters are despicable.

Another quality to the movie is it's blend of atmosphere and story, no wonder why its played over and over again on TV. I remember watching it for the first time when I was around 12 (1985) I was very impressionable then and I remember how cool it was to watch Clint go thru his motions during the movie. Nobody knew his name or where he came from, and he didn't oblige them by making them guess throughout the movie. He shot his gun with lethal accuracy when anyone gave him trouble, and was noncommittal to the cowardly townsfolk who wanted his help to take care of the outlaws released from jail.

151,Shnorg2342,One of the best American Eastwood westerns,9,24 November 2019,"High Plains Drifter is the first western to be directed by and simultaneously Star Clint Eastwood. High Plains Drifter is a fantastic dark western, and I'm not talking Sergio Leone level ""dark"" western. The movie begins with a stranger riding into town. He promptly gets a shave, shoots some annoying people, and rapes a woman. All of this make the townsfolk like him. When the townsfolk catch news that 3 brothers who once plagued the town crime are now out of prison and headed back to the town, they decide to hire the stranger, remembering how effectively he offed those pesky people earlier. They give him lots of money and complete control of the town. Naturally, he supplies the people with weapons, teaches them to shoot, and appoints the local midget mayor. He then sleeps with the woman he raped earlier, although this time she is consenting. The brothers come to town and Clint Eastwood (The Stranger) gives them the fright of a lifetime. Before there arrival, he had the townsfolk paint every building in the town red, and had them paint ""Welcome to Hell"" on the town sign. He then repeatedly whipped and shot the brothers, which is ironic because this is what the brothers did to kill the town sheriff before they were arrested. It it heavily implied that in this film, The Stranger is actually the spirit of sherif, who's been resurrected by satin to exact his bloody revenge. If that doesn't sound amazing I don't know what does.",High Plains Drifter
152,nbthalia,A satisfying western,8,4 March 2016,"The most controversial scene in this movie concerns the taking by Clint Eastwood of a ""lady"" and now referred to by many posters as a rape. These people should first of all consider the context, i.e. the ""wild west"" in the 19th century. This was not an epoch or location noted for gentility and good manners. Indeed, such attributes would have been ridiculed in a rough mining town such as this. Anyone being raised here would be influenced from a young age by ongoing situations and the general mores of the town. Let's not mince words here, this girl was a slut. Her initial approach to Clint was notable for its lack of finesse, but this girl knew no other way to approach a man. She had learnt from observation that this was the way to achieve her ends. This same approach, in a more modified form can even be seen today in some quarters. Rape? I don't think so. Her dubious character was accurately drawn. There is a strong and ironic comedic overtone to this movie and is very welcome considering some of the violence depicted. Never have so many craven cowards been assembled in one place. Of course, the movie is dated, but now takes its place as a classic of the genre. A great watch if you are in the mood for a simple plot which is brimming over with malice and satisfying revenge themes. Thank goodness Clint didn't ride off into the sunset followed by the departing unsatisfied wife who had simultaneously loaded up her buggy as Clint left town. That would have been unforgivably corny. On another note I thought the buildings in the outdoor set were unconvincing in some respects. The timber was too smooth and modern looking. Also the windows were obviously plate glass (not invented) and too sparklingly. clean considering the dusty street. And modern building materials could be seen, especially round the backs of the set.",High Plains Drifter

Eastwood had never portrayed a charachters as villanous as the Drifter in this movie, alleged Raping, abuse of power, murders and alleged raping again made this charachter something else for this movie, yet we felt for him and really wanted him to overcome the odds.Theres really good acting in this movie from some supporting charachters, the cinematography is good when it needs to be good, the plot is abit simple, but is nothing that distract ourselves that much from a really good film.Action in this movie is far more realistic to its time, quick gungslingers are replaced with more human shooters and that adds to the theme of vengance in the movie really well",High Plains Drifter

The plot is not that good, the settings do not look that ""real"", the acting cannot absorb your attention and unfortunately a lot of times you can see the actors trying to act, something that takes away all the magic. There are a lot of other old western movies that you can still watch them today and they still feel fresh ! Unfortunately, I do not think that this apply for HPD.

Dark, violent but also incredibly cool and funny at moments. Eastwood makes big impression as the anti-hero Man You Don't Mess With alias avenging angel, and by the end, literally makes hell break loose and the shot Eastwood taking revenge to one of the bad guys by whipping him to death is one of the most demonic and haunting shots I have ever seen.Although this may look like the usual western in the beginning, wait and see and you'll find a slap in the face, supernatural western which is not to be missed and will keep your mind busy for a while.

The soundtrack by Dee Barton is very eerie and shrill, often composed of wild animal-like howling that compliments the primal violence. The film is funniest when Clint Eastwood offhandedly rapes a woman without a second thought and takes over the town as if it were his right. The kindly smile he wears as he implies sexual assault to the wife of the hotel owner is priceless. You can tell Eastwood had fun making this film and also starring in it.

The most bothersome thing about this atrocious assault on the cinematic art, is the depressing waste of as solidly talented a group of actors, that any director could ever hope for. As I watched this ""film"", I kept hoping that somewhere, in the aimless, pointless jumble of screaming, gunfire and explosions, there would finally emerge something vaguely resembling a plot; something that would connect all of the foolishness, but it never happened; it just continued on, becoming more and more ridiculous, in its mindless inanity.

It's fairly standard western fair, a troubled town with dodgy characters and a stranger (Eastwood). I was disturbed by the rape scene early on and my support for the main character never really recovered from that. The strategy to deal with the real threat (i.e. returning baddies after being recently released from jail) was pretty bonkers. The stranger instructed the townies to do apparently stupid things that I hoped would later be relevant, but they sadly they never were. Having said that, it was ok but was never going to get more than a 5 from me. It's not a patch on Fistful of Dollars or The Good The Bad and The Ugly.",High Plains Drifter

161,Zagreb-1,A western straight out of the twilight zone,9,21 October 2012,"According to legend, it was a few simple edits that changed Eastwood's 1973 Western from a relatively conventional story of revenge in the near-lawless American West of the 19th century into something far more strange and far more effective.Eastwood plays the drifter of the title, a menacing anti-hero who emerges from nowhere and settles into a small town with a dark secret, first troubling and then intimidating the local townsfolk. It eventually becomes clear that Eastwood is no stranger to the town or its secret and the story eventually takes a supernatural, although never explicitly so, twist. One of the great Westerns from a period that seemed to be dotted with them (Once Upon a Time in the West, A Fistful of Dollars) and one that blurs genres to great effect.",High Plains Drifter
162,zackbutson,A Top Notch Eastwood Western,8,10 June 2010,"I love Eastwood westerns. And this is definitely one of his bests. Many fans and even Eastwood himself have pointed at this story being a supernatural tale. About a dead man returning for some unfinished business. Whether that be the case or not, I simply view this as a vengeance tale of a man who wants payback from the men who killed him, and the town that let it happen.This was also the funniest and in ways darkest westerns starring Clint. Eastwood rapes women on two different occasions (although it should be noted that clues pointed to them being consensual.) The role of the dwarf Billy Curtis as the appointed sheriff was hilarious, as was the town in general. The aspect that makes this movie so great is the story's formula. You become so accustomed to Clint saving a town, you can't help but laugh.The town's sets were sort of a let down. They seemed like they were just that, sets. Made by carpenters a week before filming. Other than that it's hard to find anything wrong with this film.This is a notch below some of Clint Eastwood's more notable westerns, but is the best of his ""second tier."" Although it may only appeal to Eastwood fans, ""Drifter"" is a great movie that really makes you appreciate Westerns in general.

They couldn't follow the scenes and couldn't make sense of the actions of the characters in this excellent movie.This is a fantastic classic western. You have ""the stranger"" (Clint Eastwood) returning from the past to right was has been wronged. Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis) is the lead outlaw and is outstanding as he and his gang show no remorse for the townsfolk that turned on them so long ago. You have the cowardly and lazy Sheriff as well and well done by Walter Barnes.This movie is a thinker too. You and the other characters in the film only realize who ""the stranger"" is towards the end when you find out his reasoning for returning after all this time. This is a great western full of gunfighters, barbers, boot makers, bartenders, lose women, action and suspense.I only gave this film a seven out of a possible ten.

167,wintry-34293,A bizarre western that takes many risks,9,22 January 2016,"Following the success of Sergio Leone's masterful 'Dollars' trilogy was surely a daunting prospect. This makes the fact that Clint Eastwood not only starred in, but directed a western with apparent gratitude to Leone and his distinctive style all the more exciting. I consider the 'Dollars' trilogy to be not only among the best westerns and trilogies of all time, but of the best films of all time, particularly the second and third instalments. It was because of this admiration that I approached High Plains Drifter with a certain ambivalence. I am well aware of Eastwood's supreme talent as a director; Play Misty for Me, however humorously dated, is still stunning, and Unforgiven was a uniquely understated yet grimly powerful film, and there are numerous other examples of his greatness, too many to state here. Yet I was surprised that I believed that, upon reflection, Eastwood did not only follow those succession of films admirably, and crucially, originally, but with one that I consider to be better than A Fistful of Dollars.High Plains Drifter carries a pervasive mystical tone, that is at first strangely disorientating, but gradually, settles into a near-perfect explanation, or excuse, for a revenge western. Throughout the film there is much typical Man with No Name-style bloodletting, the barber's scene being the most obvious example, but it is not this that interests me. It is instead the great risks Eastwood takes, not only in the film's characters and narrative, but with his own image and reputation. Due to his roles in television westerns such as Rawhide, Eastwood was in reality, a minor star. The 'Dollars' trilogy secured his lasting reputation in westerns as a strong, quiet, yet brutal and funny loner. High Plains Drifter dispenses with nearly all humour from Eastwood's character who, not coincidentally, has no name. Instead the idiosyncratic townsfolk of Lago provide much of the humour, including the almost fantastical character of the dwarf Mordecai. Also, perhaps most significantly, is the almost unbearable callousness of Eastwood's character; throughout High Plains Drifter Eastwood rapes two women, and casually dismisses them, with the second falling for him unrealistically. This is the most surprising aspect of the film; that an actor this handsome, would decide to mould himself into an image so despicable as a director. I find this impressive, because it shows Eastwood's resilience as an actor, and that he is unafraid to muddy his image.Also the film is notably more experimental in tone than the spaghetti westerns and traditional American westerns that came before; there is a dream sequence and instead of the Ennio Morricone-esque scores that were inevitably going to be imitated, High Plains Drifter utilises an innovative score comprising ghostly choirs to illustrate the main crux of the film's plot.Eastwood's character is, essentially, a wraith, who has come back to avenge the murder of federal marshal Jim Duncan, who was whipped to death by outlaws. He also resembles the marshal. His character is an angel of death figure, and much hellish imagery is used to heighten this; for instance when he is whipping the outlaws at the climax of the film, he stands illuminated by the fire surrounding him, almost resembling Satan, punishing the outlaws for their actions. In fact the entire climax of the film, despite narrative discrepancies, (where could that amount of red paint be sourced from, if timber was so hard to come by that they had to tear apart barns that were already standing to build tables?) is incredibly visceral in this regard. While the ending leaves little open for interpretation, it is the perfect conclusion to a very unique film.",High Plains Drifter
168,JLJinJax,Best of the Genre,8,16 September 1999,"High Plains Drifter is the best Western I have seen ever. Basically, Clint plays an anonymous, enigmatic cowboy who seeks revenge on all those who caused his demise (which is shown in flashback and through very shrewdly placed dialogue)in a small town called Lago. It is obvious that he is some of reincarnation of the town's former sheriff. The most likeable of the town folk is Morcedai, a diminutive barber shop helper. The one liners in the movie are very smart. What I found interesting was Clint's way with women. If it airs on the late show, I highly recommend it.",High Plains Drifter
169,Rick-125,A clever presentation of karmic laws!,10,7 December 1998,"I am tremendously fascinated by this movie. The first time I saw it, it took a long time for me to appreciate that ""The Stranger"" was a transmetamorphic revenging spirit. The revenge was carried out according to the individual and collective karmic situations of the people of Lago. The spirit ""parasitized,"" and subsequently abandoned at a crucial moment, those who passively watched as he(the marshall) was murdered. He manipulated his murderers to murder those who arranged for his murder. He directly killed the men who had killed him. After evening the score on these counts, he returned to the spiritual dimension. The term ""karma"" relates to the spiritual laws of cause and effect. ""What goes around, comes around"" is another way to expressing the karmic ""law of balance."" Our misfortunes are proportionate to the misfortunes we have caused others. There is also an illustration of the principle that ""the first shall be last and the last shall be first"" with the spirit's appointment of the town's major, and the benevolence he bestowed upon some of the local native Americans. There was also a recognition of the principle that just as wrong doing in its different forms can lead to misfortune and tragedy, altruistic action can be a source of reward. I appreciate this movie as a subtle spiritual masterpiece. I've gotten a little more out of it each time I've seen it.",High Plains Drifter

There are similarities - He is again the nameless stranger with a character similar to that played in the Dollars westerns and his dialogue is threatening yet highly amusing.However there is a supernatural quality about this film, the score is brilliantly haunting and the desolate setting - the mining town of Lago - seems almost ghostly. Eastwood delivers a fine performance as perhaps the most controversial of anti-heros featured in a western and he dominates the film from start to finish.The great thing about this film is that it's not what it seems.

The ugly stranger, wildly rapes a woman, kills people he doesn't like, forces them to give him stuff against their will, explodes a hotel, evacuates a hotel completely just for himself, more or less bosses people around, and in the same time helps some Indian with a lot of blankets, assigns a midget as the mayor and sheriff, and train civilians to be gun-fighters.",High Plains Drifter

But it's less than Clint's best work. He kept improving his perspective on us, and triumphed in Gran Torino. There are several clues as to his jaundiced and incomplete understanding of righting wrongs. People touched by god, do divine work, they do not rape and or seduce vulnerable women. Maybe he is and maybe he's not an avenging angel returned to earth. Personally, I think he need not to have spoken to Mordecai as he leaves town.

The storyline is complex and gripping although it can verge on the convoluted at times. An interesting thing to note is the distinct lack of music throughout the film. While many westerns use the ubiquitous twang of electric guitars to heighten the tension of the scene ""High Plains Drifter"" succeeds in doing this through clever use of camera and ambient sound. For example in the final showdown between The Stranger and his foes there is no music at all. The atmosphere is created by the light from the flames and the crackling of the burning timber. The one thing that annoyed me about the film is the ambiguity surrounding Clint Eastwood's character.

These scenes in and of itself wouldn't stop me watching a movie. It's quite different though when a movie sets up the rapist as the hero of the movie!You'll read a bunch of reviews about how this rapist goes to this town to dispense justice to cowardly townspeople who covered up a murder in relation to their mine. I'm sorry but that does not excuse rape. Clint Eastwood's character is meant to be an anti hero but he's not really.

No more about that, though. You'll have to watch to figure out exactly what that means.Similar to ""Pale Rider"", our hero gets the girl, but he once again rides into the sunset alone. He just can't seem to settle down, can he? In a twist, he's not in Mexico this time. In fact, he's quite familiar with his surroundings, but the movie unfolds in such a way as to allow that tenuous connection to develop teasingly slowly; very-well done. In fact, it continues to develop as the movie trails off.If you haven't unraveled the mystery by the end of the movie, don't panic. Clint reveals all in his parting remarks to his dear friend. You'll have to be quick, though. Clint's never been long on verbiage, and this is no exception. When he does speak, however, it is a good idea to listen closely.

I don't know how many times I've seen this one, but it's one of my Clint Eastwood favorites.",High Plains Drifter
185,mechafenris,Supernatural Western,9,4 November 2008,"This is one great western. (Spoilers to follow!!) Clint Eastwood outdoes himself with the eerie, surreal and sometimes horrific town of Lago and its visit from ""The Stranger"". What most people who watch this movie don't pick up on is (and I warned you about spoilers if you haven't seen it yet) The Stranger is the Marshal. He's back for revenge. Is he a ghost? Is he a reincarnated apparition? Or is he death himself coming to take the men who whipped him across to the other side? Or is it similar to Pale Rider, where the revenge is for the marshal that shot and nearly killed the Preacher. It is truly a reckoning for the outlaws and the town of Lago, either way you frame it. Lago's residents hide in fear rather than coming to the aid of the Marshal, who you only see in flashbacks from The Stranger's dreams. Upon hearing of the infamous gang's release, Lago's town council hires unsavory chaps to ""guard"" against their return. It's only hazy a bit here (and the only thing I can think of is Lago Mining company owes these bandits for running the Marshal out of town. I gather they did the owners of the mine a ""service"" and took it too far... so they got stiffed and turned in to the law.) Well, they're out of prison now and on their way back. The Stranger foils the town's plans by killing the gunslingers before he even gets a shave. Then the town is reluctantly obliged to hire the Stranger to protect them. He runs roughshod over everyone and treats the people as if they were cattle. Then in an elaborate scheme of red paint, a picnic feast and renaming the town to ""Hell"".. The Stranger gets his revenge on those who whipped him before.The reason I believe he's the Marshal is the ending... Mordecai asks one last time what his name was, as Mordecai is carving the Marshal's tombstone, and The Stranger says ""you already know"" (or words to that effect.) Meaning, Mordecai was the only one who knew he was the Marshal... and off The Stranger goes into the heat of nowhere... and that eerie music plays him out. A fine movie by Eastwood and one of his best non-Italian westerns (second only to the almighty Josey Wales..)I love this movie. If you are a fan of Westerns, you will too. But it's not the John Ford style white/black hat battles that make this movie so great. It's the moral ambiguity and indictment of a town too spineless to get involved. They pay the price for it in the end, as the town is burned to the ground and all those who could've helped but didn't are left to view the ashes of their possessions and realize their error...",High Plains Drifter
186,garrettpigden,Not Clint's greatest Western...,6,14 August 2001,"I was a little disappointed.  Admittedly, I was expecting more of a Sergio Leone style western.  Clint plays ""the Stranger"" role to a T but it just didn't have the same appeal without the whistling, dramatic cinematography, and mismatched lip/voice editing.  Plot line was pretty simple.  Setting very simple.  Heck, the whole movie is simple.  Still, a must see for Clint fans.",High Plains Drifter
187,brickmancm,Clint Eastwood's quality,7,8 August 2021,A little slow but satisfying movie. Eastwood attempts to teach a town that in order to surmount a threat they simply need to join forces and support one another. They either deserve better or deserve one another. Definitely a good western with a good dose of suspense. Recommended for a good evening of ol' Western genre movie.,High Plains Drifter
188,garvan-2,Eastwood's Vision of the West,9,6 January 2008,"In this film Eastwood continues show his vision of what a western film should be .The western is a true American art form and Eastwood's evolving vision of the west starts with High Plains Drifter and ends up with Unforgiven.The imagery from the very beginning is haunting. He sticks with a realistic vision of the west instead of some campy cowboy film ,filmed on a Hollywood lot with flashy costumes scripts full of clichés.His vision of the west is the most authentic . The influence of Sergio Leone is evident from the start ,but he takes the essence of the spaghetti western and projected his vision in to the film.This gem was the first in a long line of great Eastwood films",High Plains Drifter
189,keithh1999,My Favorite Western,10,19 March 2009,"First... Clint is my all-time favorite Western Actor.After saying that, let me say that this is my favorite Western. I own it on VHS and DVD, but I will still watch it any time I see it on TV.The opening sequence is classic... the Horse and Rider materializing out of thin air. The slow plodding horse into town after the music fades -- the only sound there is -- excellent.I just love this movie. If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself. If you haven't seen it in a while, you owe it to yourself as well.Of course, Clint looks cool during the entire movie.Clint gets the women, Clint bares his chest.Clint does what he does best in these early westerns... kill the bad guys.",High Plains Drifter
190,ice_white_tiger,Good idea that fell flat...,5,11 April 2008,"After having just watched this film, I'm frankly quite disappointed that this film has such a high rating on IMDb.I went into the movie with no expectations other than what I had read on the back of the DVD. I heard from several people that this was a decent western with a supernatural twist, and the idea really excited me. But the outcome was nothing of how I expected.While I've read the reviews that Eastwood's character was ""cruel and menacing"", I have to ask: Were we watching the same film? This ""menacing"" character gave native children candy, their father a dozen blankets, and befriends a little person. Sure, he kills a few guys in the first 5 minutes (how surprising for a Western), and he does rape a woman. However, you have to take into account that this woman quite obviously wanted the attention by causing the confrontation, and the scene in which she's taken to the office after attempting to kill him provides a good source that she's been around alittle. To be fair, none of the characters were likable, and the only character which had any real depth to them was the leading bad guy, who should've got much more screen time.You can tell that Clint Eastwood was (trying) to emulate Sergio Leone's superior style, but I found everything, from the characters to the atmosphere, just a cheap imitation of earlier better Westerns. ""The Stranger"" was a bad Western cliché who was nowhere near as iconic as Blondie.I'll give it to Eastwood - the idea of being a supernatural Western was cool, and the soundtrack was in all fairness fairly decent. It's an average film that deserves an average rating.",High Plains Drifter
191,dierretxed,The Man With No Name,10,15 April 2020,"One of the top 5 westerns ever! We still never guessed his name or who he was. He just materialised from the plains, and blended in upon leaving. ""What did you say your name was again?"" I didn't.",High Plains Drifter
192,sawman-24193,Clint Eastwood's film High Plains Drifter (1973),10,21 March 2018,"The first time I saw High Plains Drifter was probably in the late 1970s. Clint Eastwood stars in and directs the film. Most westerns are either about cattle drives or cowboys and Indians. High Plains Drifter is different: this is a God's-Judgment-on-the-wicked western.Clint Eastwood plays a stranger who rides into the town of Lago--and he has a really bad attitude. This stranger is also very good with a side arm. During the course of the film, the stranger ends up killing some bad guys and burning the town of Lago to the ground. There are a couple of flashbacks of one Marshall Jim Duncan being whipped to death. At the end of the film, the audience can see that the stranger was the Second Coming of Marshall Duncan:The stranger rides out of the town of Lago past the cemetery. This little guy named Mordecai is writing something on a grave marker. The stranger looks at Mordecai and Mordecai looks up and says, ""I'm almost done here.""Then Mordecai asks the stranger, ""I never did know your name.""And the stranger replies, ""Yes, you do.""As the stranger rides off, the camera shows the grave marker: ""Marshall Jim Duncan.""I have a short story entitled ""High Plains Drifter"" (Ethos, March & May 1995); I have a book entitled High Plains Drifter: A Hitchhiking Journey Across America (PublishAmerica, December 2008); I have a blog called ""High Plains Drifter."" So is this some sort of gunslinger fixation or is there method to my madness? The clue is in one Scripture: ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established.""There is a lot of sin (unrepented sin) in the United States and in the world. When people continue to live in sin, eventually God's Judgment falls. The more people try to hide their sin, the greater God's Judgment. The people of Lago tried to hide the murder of Marshall Duncan, but their sin was found out. You can't hide from God.There is a scene in High Plains Drifter where this lady tells the stranger, ""Ever since Marshall Duncan's death, the people in this town are afraid of strangers.""
_____""When the Stranger says: 'What is the meaning of this city?
Do you huddle close together because you love each other?'
What will you answer? 'We all dwell together
To make money from each other'? or 'This is a community'?""Oh my soul, be prepared for the coming of the Stranger.
Be prepared for him who knows how to ask questions.""There is one who remembers the way to your door:
Life you may evade, but Death you shall not.
You shall not deny the Stranger.""--T.S. Eliot
Choruses from ""The Rock""_____There is another scene in High Plains Drifter where the people of Lago (the town of Lago reminds me of Algona, Iowa) are meeting at the church. One of the guys is speaking in the front of the church. The camera then pans to the right and shows a bulletin board with this Scripture:Isaiah 53: 3-4: ""Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed."" Marshall Jim Duncan was whipped to death; Jesus Christ was at least nine-tenths whipped to death. The stranger riding into Lago (the first scene of the film) is a symbol of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ: not as the Lamb of God, but as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.Isaiah 63: 1-6: ""Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.""",High Plains Drifter
193,caspar-arnhold,"The back-story of Unforgiven, at least it could be",10,18 September 2006,"When I first saw the film in England in 1993, while I was studying at the Actor's Studio, Ms Hill was my teacher. And of course, being a young and curious student I wanted to know by whom I was taught. So, I got the film, sat down with a Coke and some popcorn and watched it. After the the film was finished, I realized I hadn't even touched the popcorn and didn't drink anything from my Coke. I was just very much into the story. I asked myself, if it was because the next morning I would see Ms Hill again, seeing her in a different light? No. I had just seen a film really worth watching. And I was proud of my teacher, that she had participated in such a great movie. Excellent film! A must see for movie lovers and especially young filmmakers! Thrilling storyline with a fine twist at the end. Great visuals, and very well told. At times controversial and shocking, but let's be honest; what's film-making all about?! Impressingly great performance by Mariana Hill and Clint Eastwood. This film has absolute cult status and became one of my favorites!!",High Plains Drifter
