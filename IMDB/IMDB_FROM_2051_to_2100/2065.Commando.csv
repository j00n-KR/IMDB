0,MartinHafer,pointless and violent,2,1 June 2006,"This is one of Arnold's earliest films. And, it's obvious the producers and writers had no faith in his acting ability or ability to say his lines. So, instead of plot and acting, they just have him bow things up and kill people. And, unfortunately, that's about all there is to this movie. Seriously.Here's what little plot there is in a nutshell. Arnold is ticked because he's gotten a raw deal so he decides to run about with an arsenal about the size of the Chinese military and blow up baddies. Along the way, Rae Dawn Chong shows up for little reason in particular and somehow Arnold is able to avoid killing her. It's really too bad that he didn't direct these killer impulses on those responsible for this film. As for Arnold himself, I guess I can't blame him for doing this awful film--after all, I'm sure they gave him a mountain of cash to do it!",Commando
1,Leofwine_draca,"A gratuitously violent, tongue-in-cheek roller-coaster ride",10,14 May 2016,"I think I have to agree with a fellow reviewer on this movie... ""absolute perfection"" is probably the best way I would sum up this film. Indeed this all-out action, gratuitously violent, tongue-in-cheek roller-coaster ride is a must-see for the action movie fan and, if viewed in the right mood, it's a total riot. Actually I rank this film as one of Arnie's best, up there with the two TERMINATOR films anyway, and I far prefer it to the deadly serious/repetitive RAMBO films that Stallone was making at the same time. This is the first film that Arnie made when he started to gently make fun at his own image, while at the same time being outrageously over the top and using his physique to do the talking. I mean, check out the scene where his character is first introduced. He's carrying a damn tree trunk on his shoulder! Like the best action movies, COMMANDO packs in tons of action, explosions and violence into its trim running time. It's one big set-piece after another with only a little bit of plot-building in-between. Highlights include a huge battle with the police in a shopping mall, a flash car chase through streets at night and the big one, the finale where Arnie becomes a one-man army and kills about a hundred soldiers at the baddie's island retreat. The final fifteen minutes are sheer bliss for the action lover who's looking for a good time.Arnie is in his element here, snapping off his one-liners at just the right tones and with precision (of one guy who he dropped over a cliff edge, ""I let him go!""), trying out his soon-to-become trademark catchphrases, and proving himself a force to be reckoned with in the action scenes. Rae Dawn Chong is the token female lead who acquits herself well with her role, proves to be likable, and creates a realistic (well, for the film) transformation from being a frightened victim into a rocket launching weapon of destruction. I still remember the first time I saw the scene where she accidentally shot the rocket launcher the wrong way down a street...it blew me (and the shop front) away! Dan Hedaya is pretty forgettable as the chief baddie, instead it's Vernon Wells (MAD MAX 2) as his henchman Bennett who steals all of his scenes as the outrageous string-vested mercenary who manages to be a match for Arnie, if in terms of fearsomeness instead of bulk. The supporting cast is also very good, with AMITYVILLE II's priest James Olson as Arnie's Major General, Alyssa Milano as Arnie's captured kid, Bill Duke (PREDATOR) as an imposing hit-man, David Patrick Kelly as the irritating and short bad guy, plus a glimpse-and-you'll-miss-him Bill Paxton.The violence is played for laughs instead of being there to shock, like when Arnie nonchalantly breaks a bad guy's neck on a plane, or when he shoots a bad guy in cold-blood at the film's beginning. Only in the final massacre does it become serious, with a beautiful mansion and its grounds laid to waste, hundreds of men exploding or being shot. Gotta love that interlude where Arnie hides out in a garden shed and tries out some new weapons. The stunts are endless, from Arnie rolling a jeep freefall down a hill to taking a mad dive on a balloon display through the shopping mall. The final knife fight is pretty good too, ending the film on a high-note with another cheesy one-liner (the classic ""let off some steam, Bennett""), and you've gotta love the way Arnie's various wounds suddenly heal up and disappear. Another fantastic film from Mark Lester, the guy who astounded us with CLASS OF 1984, and the pinnacle of the '80s action film.",Commando
2,SnoopyStyle,Good action from Arnold right from the get-go,7,6 March 2014,"John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was an elite special op who is now retired living in his mountain home with his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). His men are getting killed one by one. One of his former group Bennett (Vernon Wells) joins warlord Arius (Dan Hedaya) to start a coup in his home country. They kidnap Jenny to force John Matrix to fly down to that country to assassinate the president. However he escapes from the flight to track down Jenny with the help of Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) who he grabs at the airport.The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't take its time to get started. The action gets going right away. The bad guy has barely gotten one line out about his kidnapped daughter before he gets a bullet in his head. It's all action from Schwarzenegger. There is no negotiations. He delivers some delicious one-liners. The most memorable is ""Remember Sully when I promised to kill you last? I lied!!"". And who could forget the Jamaican steel drum music. It's just a fun movie.",Commando
3,Prismark10,Commando,6,19 July 2020,"Until this point. Arnold Schwarzenegger had played Conan the Barbarian that relied on his physique as he just had a few words to say.The Terminator also had few words to say. The emphasis on his physique had shifted with the Terminator being mainly clothed.In Commando is where Schwarzenegger began to develop his screen presence. He repeats his line from The Terminator; 'I'll be back.' Then there are the humorous quips, some of them taken from previous James Bond movies such as 'I let him go.'Schwarzenegger plays John Matrix a retired special forces veteran now living in a remote mountain home with his daughter Jenny.However the men in his former unit are being killed off and his former commander visits to warn him.Soon Jenny is kidnapped by a former South American dictator Arius that Matrix helped depose and he is aided by a traitor from Matrix's former unit.Matrix is told to go to the South American country and kill the president so that Arius could take over again. That is the only way Matrix will get his daughter back.Matrix knows that Arius will not keep his word. With the clock ticking, he escapes from the plane bound for South America and takes the fight to the bad guys. Matrix is helped by a flight attendant Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong.)Commando is a loud brash action movie with lots of violence, explosions and Matrix coming out with his one liners. A lot of stuntmen are kept busy jumping off things while there are explosions in the background. It is comic strip B movie, not to be taken seriously and really pushed Schwarzenegger to being a big box office star which he would cement in the following year with Predator.The most memorable bad guy is Sully (David Patrick Kelly) who bizarrely hits on Cindy like a creep at the airport when he is there to make sure that Matrix has safely left on the plane. Kelly specialised in playing nasally weaselly villains in the 1980s which started off in The Warriors.",Commando
4,claudio_carvalho,Another Great Action Movie from the 80's,7,9 February 2015,"The retired Special Forces Colonel John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) lives a calm life with his beloved daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano) in an isolated house in the woods of a mountain. One day, his mentor Major General Franklin Kirby (James Olson) visits him and tells that the men he had trained for his unit are being killed and he leaves two soldiers to protect Matrix. However the helicopter of General Kirby has been followed by hit men that abduct Jenny and Matrix. Soon Matrix learns that Bennett (Vernon Wells) that belonged to his unit and was presumed dead is the responsible for attack to his house. Further, Bennett was hired by Arius (Dan Hedaya), a former president of a South American country that Matrix had overthrown. Now Arius wants Matrix to assassinate the president of his country in order to assume the position again otherwise he will kill Jenny. Matrix is forced to embark in a flight to the country with one of Bennett's thug while another one, Sully (David Patrick Kelly), will confirm that Matrix is in the flight. However Matrix manages to kill the thug and leave the plane and has eleven hours to save Jenny. He convinces the flight attendant Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) to help him to save his daughter.""Commando"" is another great action movie from the 80's, maybe the best decade in the cinema history for this genre. The screenplay has non-stop action and funny and unforgettable moments. My favorite is when John Matrix tells to Sully that he likes him and he will be the last one to die. Soon he corrects, saying ""I lied"". I did not recognized Alyssa Milano, from ""Charmed"", in her second role as Jenny. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Comando Para Matar"" (""Commando to Kill"")",Commando
5,kosmasp,Äktschn!,9,22 July 2007,"That's kind of how Ah-nold pronounces the word ""action""! And I don't mean it in any mean way, he's just funny like that. Or in that case his Austrian accent. The accent makes his one liners all the more spectacular, as also seen in this movie. A movie that makes no excuses or tries to be anything other than an 80s action movie, with some (antiques) cliché! Mr. Schwarzenegger (or Governateur as of recent years) plays an Ex-Elite Commando (hence the title) here, who due to a development in the beginning of the movie, gets sucked back into doing, what he does best: Kicking asses! Is brainless action something you can watch and enjoy? Then go ahead and watch this ... haven't watched the DC yet (because it's not out yet), but I'm sure that's the one you should be looking for, for the extra (uncut) action!",Commando
6,gavin6942,Going Commando is Less Chafing Than I Thought,7,4 September 2005,"A retired elite Black Ops Commando (Arnold Schwarzenegger) launches a one man war against a group of South American criminals who have kidnapped his daughter (Alyssa Milano) to blackmail him into starting a revolution and getting an exiled dictator back into power.Not long after the film gets going, Arnold picks up a stewardess (Rae Dawn Chong) and her sweet convertible along the way to flying to a remote island (apparently a few miles off the coast of California) for the sole purpose of making people do back flips and dance when shot or hit by grenades. The grenades never seem to kill anyone, but only make them spin in awkward aerial motions. This may be the only film that has more stunt men than actors.The dark humor of this film is unmatched in an action film, and even Bill Paxton shows up for a while. Music by the critically acclaimed James Horner and 1980s super-group Power Station (Duran Duran with Robert Palmer) never hurts. The action itself has to be a bit of a joke, because it is more than a little over the top.The romantic angle also seems a stretch, even by Hollywood standards... and the opening montage showing how much Arnold loves his daughter (and she loves him)? Ridiculous. And yet, this is all part of the film's charm and makes it arguably the best Arnold action film (though he has had many winners).If you like action films starring guys who speak poor English -- highly recommended. Otherwise, rent ""The Professional"" for a similar theme of father-figure doting on his Lolita-esque daughter-figure, or ""Taken"" to see Liam Neeson kick terrorist butt to save his daughter.",Commando
7,lee_eisenberg,Schwarzenegger commands a dumb - but enjoyable - performance,5,25 November 2005,"I gave ""Commando"" a 5/10 rating because it's one of those movies that only seeks to appeal to one group of people (in this case 13-year-old boys, give or take), while everyone else will find it ridiculous. I should note that this is the average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie (by which I mean don't even attempt to take it seriously; just accept it as nice, brainless fun).Buff ex-commando John Matrix (Schwarzenegger) lives in the mountains with daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). Then, ex-dictator Arius (Dan Hedaya) - whom Matrix helped overthrow - kidnaps Jenny and demands that Matrix help him take over again. From there, the whole movie pretty much consists of Matrix kicking as much ass as is humanly (or is that super-humanly?) possible to get his daughter back. In the process, flight attendant Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) joins up with Matrix.Like I said, this is the average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie: there's lots of explosions and one-liners (I really liked the cliff scene). If you're a macho guy who just likes kick-ass stuff, then ""Commando"" is the movie for you; if you're an artistic type who wants everything to be mise-en-scene, then avoid this movie like you would the Ebola virus.",Commando
8,jboothmillard,Commando,6,12 July 2005,"A very interesting action film, some very small corny moments and some unlikely situations, but still fun to watch. The film begins with three men being killed in cold blood, and then we see the very close and loving relationship between retired special army forces agent John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his daughter Jenny (Poison Ivy II: Lily's Alyssa Milano). Matrix's former men (with new identities) are being killed, and his old leader Arius (Dan Hedaya) is sure Matrix is next, and soon enough, not long after Arius left, Matrix is captured, and his daughter kidnapped. The villain Bennett (Vernon Wells), a former member of Matrix's unit tells him that he must help them with a political assassination, or they kill Jenny. Matrix is put on a plane, that is meant to last 11 hours, but he manages to escape (out the cargo hold), and he is now following all Bennet's henchmen to try and find where his daughter is being held. Joining him in his journey (unintentionally, for a while) is Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), who has experience in flying planes. After many run-ins with the cops, the henchmen and some ""shopping"" (for weaponry), Matrix and Cindy do find the island Jenny is on, and it's one man versus at least 100 in the guarded base. Also starring James Olson as Gen. Franklin Kirby, David Patrick Kelly as Sully and Predator's Bill Duke as Cooke. The action is engaging, the story also has its grip, Schwarzenegger of course is fun (and this was just after he first played The Termiantor), and Wells is a good Australian bad guy. I am sure director Mark L. Lester intentionally made bits of this film ridiculous or eye-catching, i.e. seeing a lot of Arnie's body, one man versus at least 100, and it makes both an action packed and amusing film to watch, oh, and the ending song, Power Station's ""We Fight For Love"" is a very good choice. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Good!",Commando
9,Tweekums,An '80s Action Classic,8,29 May 2008,"With all the things wrong with this film it should be terrible but it isn't, it is in fact great from start to finish with lots of action and plenty of one liners.The film starts with the assassination of a few people who we soon learn were part of Arnie's special forces team. No sooner have the military warned him about the threat than he is attacked. After killing several of the attackers he is captured and his daughter, played by a young Alyssa Milano, is kidnapped. He is informed that unless he catches a plane to a fictional third world country and kills the president they will kill his daughter.Does he try to negotiate? does he seek the help of the military? No... he boards the plane, kills his escort and jumps from the plane as it is taking off. He then kidnaps Cindy, a stewardess who conveniently is learning how to fly and hunts down the bad guys. Conveniently each one he finds (and kills) is carrying a clue to find another until he discovers where his daughter is being held.When he gets there he has to take on what appears to be an army, these present him with little problem as he never misses and never runs out of ammunition and they are incapable of hitting a huge target like Arnie.The film ends with Arnie and Bennett (who had been kicked out of Arnie's unit prior to the events in the film) having a knife fight while exchanging one liners.The plot is clearly rather corny and the continuity is poor, watch the damage disappearing and reappearing on Sully's yellow Porche. Despite all that it is a must see for fans of the action genre.",Commando
10,BA_Harrison,Classic Arnie mayhem.,8,13 March 2016,"Disgraced commando Bennett (Vernon Wells) kidnaps Jenny (Alyssa Milano), the teenage daughter of his retired superior John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger), with the hope of blackmailing her father into killing the president of a banana republic. Matrix has other ideas, and, with a little help from trainee pilot Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), borrows a shopping cart full of weapons, a pair of flippers, and some black Speedos to wage a one-man war against the bad guys.If my memory serves me correctly, Commando was the first 18-certificate I ever saw at the cinema, so nostalgia undoubtedly plays some part in my love for the film. Taking off my rose-tinted glasses for a second, I can see that the film is incredibly naff in places, with numerous cheesy action scenes in which the hero stabs, shoots and blows up countless enemy soldiers (including numerous static dummies) without suffering so much as a scratch.However, with star Arnold spitting one-liners like an Uzi spits bullets, lively direction from Mark L. Lester (Class of 1984, Showdown in Little Tokyo), a script that acknowledges its ridiculousness (Cindy proclaiming ""I can't believe this macho bullshit""), and lots of OTT cartoon-style violence, it all amounts to a hugely entertaining dollop of '80s action excess. **Puts rose-tinted glasses back on** they just don't make 'em like this anymore.",Commando
11,paul_haakonsen,"I eat Green Berets for breakfast. And right now, I'm very hungry!...",7,9 June 2018,"This is one of those timeless classics from Arnold Schwarzenegger that you do not get tired of watching, despite knowing the storyline so well already.The movie is from 1985 and is definitely one of the defining movies in the early stages of Schwarzenegger's action movie career.""Commando"" has a heap of action, and actually has a good story and of course it is crammed with one-liners.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rae Dawn Chong carry the movie quite nicely, while Vernon Wells in the role of the main bad guy was just laughable because of the way the character was written and the fact that he wore a chainmail shirt throughout the entire movie.There are lots of mistakes in the movie, with the obvious ones being Sully's yellow Porsche that alternates between having a severely damaged chassis to being in mint condition and then going back to being severely damaged. But also the numerous scenes where it is painstakingly obvious that it is a stunt double for Schwarzenegger performing the action sequences.But all in all, a very entertaining action movie filled with nostalgia.",Commando
12,Quinoa1984,These guys eat too much red meat.,7,10 January 2010,"If you love movies, especially those All-American ones with lots of guys killing each other with lots of guns and rocket launchers and knife fights and Arnold Schwarzenegger (yeah, he's not American technically, but he might as well be by now), then you'll at some point have to come across Commando. And you know what? It's about as equally idiotic and F***-YEAH entertaining as you can ask for. Hell, you don't even need to be a person of the male human species: the right girl may even find this funnier and more exciting than the boys. And make no mistake, please don't: this is a COMEDY first, and then action movie second... actually, they're interchangeable, but it's nice to think of it as a real satire on these kinds of movies, even before they got into the realm of self-seriousness with the likes of Steven Segal.Just from the opening credits where John Matrix and his daughter have fun and eat ice cream and (I'm not kidding) pet a friggin' deer - no, before that the way the 'garbage man' plugs about twenty unnecessary bullets into the guy in front of his house - it's already set to not take itself seriously. And from then on, when its 'plot' develops, what little and quintessentially Ah-Nuld 80's action movie needs to have (""We'll kill your daughter if you don't kill this guy in what-a-what country in some other place somewhere""), and we get rolling on a series of action scenes and fights strung together by a terribly annoying side-character pilot (Rae Dawn Chong), and by a few clips here and there of Dan Hedaya doing his worst imitation of an angry Russian villain. Oh, and then there's Bennett...There's so much here I could talk and rave about, from the mall set-piece where every mall cop in five states comes to take Schwarzenegger down to no avail (the guy can pick up and chuck a guy in a phone booth like it's a ball), or how Rae Dawn Chong tries to get Matrix out of an armored police car by firing a rocket launcher herself THE WRONG WAY before getting it right, then to say ""Hey, I read the instructions!"", or how very much so... 1980's the climax is, from the synth-porn music score to Arnold in a speedo (to Arnold in camouflage) and then that shoot-out. Oh boy. So much and so little time. But suffice to say while it's not made with much intelligence at all, or regard for human life (granted, Matrix isn't the Terminator in 1984 so he's not exactly a villain, more like Charles Bronson on 1892912 grams of steroids), it's still an incredibly (almost) guilty pleasure.You almost think, in a weird way, why movies can be so entertaining when watching Commando. You can't for a second, not a shred of an instant, take any of this macho-shoot-em-up hokum seriously, and yet I don't think the filmmakers and writers do either. On top of the action and swagger and bad-ass lines, it's clever about its own stupidity... that doesn't totally let it off the hook. But, holy hell, just turn off the intellectual properties of your brain, crack open a beer and turn up the testosterone! Did I mention how awesome Bennett's demise is?",Commando
13,BandSAboutMovies,LET OFF SOME STEAM,8,15 July 2020,"Do you remember that feeling where you wanted to be a character in a movie? As we grow up, that feeling goes away. Well let me tell you, I can still feel the yearning to be John Matrix that I felt as a 13-year-old. Sure, Conan the Barbarian and The Terminator made many take notice of Arnold. This is the movie that - to me - put him over the top.Director Mark Lester told Empire, ""It's the granddaddy of action films as we know them today. And Arnold was the reason it got made.""Who knew that it was originally a movie all about a soldier turning his back on violence? Well, that wasn't what ended up on the screen. Instead, we have Arnold gleefully getting revenge on all manner of soldiers, thugs, mercs and habitual linesteppers for around 90 minutes of rip roaring fun.Yet when the movie starts, John Matrix is happy. He's in the woods, feeding deer by hand, hanging out with his daughter Alyssa Milano and carrying trees around by himself. Then, after turning down an offer to come back in, a bunch of no-goodniks come on in and take his daughter. Even worse, his old best friend Bennett (Vernon Wells!) is their leader.Also: Bennett dresses like, well, no one who has ever lived on this earth before. A chain mail sleeveless shirt would be enough, but then he has leather pants and fingerless gloves. It's as if the entire design staff of Capcom, Data East, Konami and SNK all looked at the screen and said, ""This is the blueprint for every fighting game we will ever make.""Wells is legitimately unhinged in this movie. In that same Empire article, he said "".. I was so hyped to be in the movie, they could have asked me to jump off the Empire State Building and I probably would have. Making Commando was better than anything you could have smoked.""Wings Hauser was going to play Bennett, which probably would have been awesome too.This is a movie where Arnold murders between 81-102 people in twenty minutes. There's a rocket launcher scene that sends me into a fit of hysteria. The hanging dudes off cliffs by their feet. All the wonderous one-liners. And oh yeah, ""Let off some steam, Bennett!"" You have no clue how many times that scene was rewound while we all screamed the line to one another.Arnold made two films at Sherman Oaks and that place should have a gold statue of him that we can all genuflect in front of. This movie is a piece of cinema that no one would have the audacity to make today.Look, when Dan Heyada is the big bad of your film, you're doing it right.",Commando
14,Coventry,"Good old '80s shoot 'em up, with Arnie",5,6 April 2015,"I seriously don't intend to write an overlong, tedious or allegedly in-depth review, because – let's be honest – ""Commando"" is nothing more than a totally undemanding and brainless piece of '80s popcorn/blockbuster action flick! This is pure pro-violence propaganda; chock-full of hilarious stereotypes, thankfully impossible situations and a whole lot of insignificant extra day- players (preferably dressed in khaki army outfits) being mowed away by machine gun artillery and rocket launchers. In between his most successful '80s action hits ""The Terminator"" and ""Predator"", Arnold Schwarzenegger first started using awfully ridiculous one-liners in this flick from veteran writer Steven E. de Souza (""Die Hard"", ""48 Hrs."") and director Mark L. Lester (""Class of 1984""). Several incredibly mean baddies are killing off the retired Black Ops Commander John Matrix' former squad members! They turn out to be accomplices of the exiled South American dictator Arius, whose reign of tyranny Matrix and his squad helped to overthrow. Arius want to become President of Val Verde again, so he kidnapped Matrix' teenage daughter and blackmails him into traveling to Val Verde and killing the righteous president. The fun thing about ""Commando"" is that it never becomes a guerrilla type of war flick set somewhere in the midst of tropical Southern jungles, since Arnie jumps out of the plane and sets his clock to 11 hours in order to kill all villains and save his daughter. Schwarzenegger looks like a plastic action figure, especially when wearing his camouflage colors, while the villains are just downright priceless! Dan Hedaya depicts a textbook South American dictator, Bill Duke is the big mean hit man and David Patrick Kelly (the legendary Luther from ""The Warriors"") as the sleazy and foul-mouthed scumbag. But most the most notable character is undeniably Vernon Well as the oppressed homosexual/psychopathic Village People band member. The character drawings must have been tongue-in-cheek, right? Right?!?",Commando

16,hitchcockthelegend,"I eat Green Berets for breakfast. And right now, I'm very hungry!",7,28 March 2020,"Commando is directed by Mark L. Lester and written by Jeph Loeb, Matthew Weisman and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rae Dawn Chong, Dan Hedaya, Vernon Wells, James Olson, David Patrick Kelly, Alyssa Milano and Bill Duke. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.John Matrix (Schwarzenegger) is the former leader of a special commando strike force that always got the toughest jobs done. He is forced back into action when his young daughter (Milano) is kidnapped by kingpin criminal Arius (Hedaya) and his gang of thugs. They want Matrix to carry out an assassination, but all Matrix has on his mind is to save his daughter - he has half a day to do so before the thugs will kill her - so it's now a private war...After playing ""Conan"" and ""The Terminator"", Schwarzenegger slipped into a role that would prove to carry all the hallmarks of the big man's action movie career. Commando is awash with outrageous action, pure carnage and gruesome deaths, plenty of quippy one liners, and of course over the top villains.Clocking in at just 90 minutes in length, it's the perfect ""leave the brain at the door"" popcorn crowd pleaser. Chong gets a well written lead lady part, giving us a spunky heroine who evolves as the plot grows ever more chaotic, and young Milano gets to play a resourceful child character.High art it is not, but who cares if you want to just watch Arnie waylay a whole army on his own. Great fun. 7/10",Commando
17,Theo Robertson,Typical Arnie Film,4,6 October 2003,"I remember when COMMANDO was originally released in the mid 1980s when all the critics were describing it as "" A Rambo rip off "" . To be honest it probably owes more to James Bond than Sly Stallone with a mixture of violence of wise cracks like "" Don`t disturb my friend he`s dead tired "" . Looking back upon it now it`s very obvious that it`s the first typical Arnie blockbuster with laughs and explosions in equal measure along with more than a few dumb scenes like the hero blowing away a couple of hundred bad guys . It should also be pointed out that the production values don`t really match up to Arnie`s later films with several cardboard cutouts replacing actors in the climatic battle , but if you like Arnie`s movies you`ll certainly like this",Commando
18,Scarecrow-88,Commando,8,7 March 2009,"The Schwarzenegger answer to Stallone's Rambo is John Matrix, an ex-commando(..the best there is, of course), retired under a new name living comfortably with his daughter Jenny(Alyssa Milano, adorably cute as his kid), forced back into service when an ex-partner, Bennett(Vernon Wells, wonderfully over-the-top and slimy;the perfect antithesis to Schwarzenegger)betrays him for kicking him off his unit for uncontrollably bloodthirsty behavior in the field. Bennett assists a sadistic and cruel overthrown political leader(..in some unnamed Latin country, of which doesn't matter), Arius(Dan Hedaya, perfectly malicious)in finding John's whereabouts, proposing that he must kill the established figurehead who replaced him or Jenny will be ""sent to him in pieces"". Those responsible for this operation are in for a world of hurt as Matrix, boarding the plane towards the destination of the ordered murder, will establish his own grand plan to eliminate each member of this scheme, understanding that he has only a number of hours to get to Jenny before Bennett kills her. That so begins the body count. Of course, these movies have a co-starring female civilian who gets caught in the mix, and that role went to Rae Dawn Chong, as Cindy, a flight attendant Sully(David Patrick Kelly, cleaned up, but still a scumbag), one of the crooks working for Arius in the states, takes a shine to. Matrix only plans to gain her assistance in keeping Sully busy until he can get information to where Arius and Bennett are located, but, of course, things get out of hand and she's flung into the developing operation. Cindy even helps out Matrix later because of her ""skills""(..she's taking flight school)as an amateur pilot. Heck, during Matrix's ""shopping spree"" commandeering weapons and arsenal from a gun store, Cindy actually rescues him from potential prison time thanks to a rocket launcher! Bill Duke has a small role as Cooke, a heavy Matrix battles in hand-to-hand combat who also works for Arius in the states and knows where Jenny is located. One by one all associated to Arius will meet their doom at the hands of Matrix as he heads for the fiends heavily guarded fortress, with weapons and arsenal, prepared for war. James Olson is Major General Franklin Kirby, essentially fulfilling the Colonel Trautman role from Rambo, as the man who trained Matrix and knows his capabilities as a soldier.Cartoonish, ridiculous action film I'm sure repelled critics at the time because Matrix is an absolute killing machine. No one that attempts aggression against him lasts very long. The hysterical mall sequence where Matrix chases after Sully will have you in ribbons it's so unbelievable(..he literally lifts up a phone booth with Sully in it, hurling it in the air and to the floor, while also wiping out a group of policemen and mall security)as is the climax where he's successfully able to gun down and blow to smithereens an army of heavily equipped baddies shooting non-stop. Explosions galore and many a man is dropped by gunfire and knives to their torsos. In a startlingly violent sequence, Matrix, inside a tool shed, stabs a soldier in the chest with a rake, cuts an arm off with a machete, and takes the top of another's head off with a thrown saw blade! The pace blazes by because of Matrix hasn't got but hours to figure out where his daughter is and to get to her. Rae Dawn Chong has some very realistic responses to the madness and violence around her, and her zingers are just as funny as the usual Arnie one-liners once destroying a foe. Perfectly 80's, there's a clear definition of who is the hero and villains. Arnie's role is larger than life..a muscular Adonis whose immune to bullets no matter how many people are shooting at him. And, he's equipped with supernatural power, with an ability to carry a large log on his shoulder, can rip doors off hinges, and break apart locked chains..as does Bennett, who, in a very amusing scene throws his body through a wood-padded wall right after Jenny had removed a portion of it(..this obviously, for her, took a while)with a door knob. If you are to like an action film such as this, you positively have to suspend disbelief, because it operates without real logic..and I love this movie for that.",Commando
19,Hey_Sweden,"I always laugh at this movie. If Matrix were here, he'd laugh too.",8,3 September 2012,"Solidly entertaining, over the top, comic book style spectacle giving superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger the perfect opportunity to play action hero with more levity than usual. Screenwriter Steven E. de Souza injects lots of wit and memorable one liners into the mix while director Mark L. Lester serves up the assorted action scenes with great relish. Granted, it's absolutely pure nonsense, but irresistible on that level.Arnold plays John Matrix, retired soldier who's forced back into action when a vengeance minded former dictator (Dan Hedaya) wants him to murder a sitting president and kidnaps Matrix's daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano) in order to make him do it. Fortunately, Matrix manages to slip away from the bad guys, and acquires some unlikely help in the form of feisty stewardess Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), while the clock is ticking the entire time.""Commando"" is appreciably unpretentious stuff that knows what it has to do and does it in style. We get to see Arnold, among other things, rip a phone booth out of a wall, dangle a man over the edge of a cliff with one hand, swing from the roof of a mall using balloons, tear a seat out of a car, eat a Green Beret for breakfast (he's VERY hungry, don't you know?), go on an early morning shopping trip at the local surplus store, lug an enormous log around, get a face full of ice cream, drop from a plane into a swamp, and feed a deer. Now, who can read that and pass this up? ""Commando"" is tons of fun provided the prospective viewer is ready to suspend every bit of their disbelief. The movie just rockets forward with no filler to slow it down, taking place within a limited amount of time, and keeping up an amazing energy level.Arnold, for the first time here, got to show that he did indeed have a sense of humour about what he did, and is very easy to watch, with a great supporting cast - also including Vernon Wells, as one of the most priceless villains to ever grace the action genre, James Olson, David Patrick Kelly, and Bill Duke, with bit appearances by the likes of Bob Minor, Chelsea Field, Branscombe Richmond, and Bill Paxton. James Horner's music score is awfully familiar, but it does help drive the movie forward, and there are some beautiful moments of extreme violence - including scalping by saw blade and an arm chopped off - to give the presentation some real punch.Check your brain at the door and you can have a really good time with this one, or in other words, let off some steam.Eight out of 10.",Commando
20,Doylenf,Classic Arnie action film with non-stop action thrills...,6,30 July 2007,"I lost track of the body count after John Matrix (ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER) begins his non-stop assault tactics on an ousted dictator's army and attempts to get his daughter (ALYSSA MILANO) from the clutches of the army's leaders. Some of the stunts are pulled off with such realism that the effect can be staggering--and although an army of stuntman are named during the film's credits, it looks as though Arnie himself did a lot of his own stunts.COMMANDO is essential Schwarzenegger from the '80s, with the actor in top physical condition and looking every bit the comic action hero he's asked to play, going through all the paces with grim jawline and steady gaze and biceps to spare. He actually makes the action seem possible, even when you know it's all about as credible as a comic strip.It's sheer action fun from start to finish, never dragging for a moment and with only one intention--to give action fans their money's worth. This it does--in spades. All of the action scenes are spectacular, staged for maximum effect and James Horner's background score is a big help.Highly recommended for fans of this kind of action thriller and all in a brisk running time of 90 minutes.",Commando

To get her back he has to kill someone else.An 80s action film all the way. It's full of noisy battles, tons of gun play, loads of fistfights and a grand total of EIGHTY-ONE bloody on-screen deaths! The film works so well because it has a good, strong sense of humor and never takes itself seriously. It makes all the blood and gore seem cartoonish. The plot barrels also full speed and it's very short (88 min). Also Rae Dawn Chong (whatever happened to...?) is very good in a supporting role. My only complaint is that the final battle between Arnie and psycho Vernon Wells (badly overacting) is way too violent--even for this film. Otherwise, well worth seeing--lots of fun if you don't mind mindless, violent films (like me).

He manages to recruit an air-hostess ""Cindy"" (Rae Dawn Chong) who quickly develops lethal ninja skills, though perhaps she is not so hot with a rocket-launcher, and off to track her down they go. It's entirely gung-ho with lots of pyrotechnics, gun battles and Arnie is in his element throughout. Don't worry about the dialogue, that matters not - it's just an action-packed excuse for the star to let loose his muscles and tear the place up before an ending that even a five year old could easily anticipate.

23,poolandrews,"Do films get any better than this? Simple answer, no.",8,18 May 2008,"Commando starts as General Franklin Kirby (James Olson) makes contact with former elite commando & one man army John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to warn him that the men from his old unit are being assassinated one by one & that he might be next. The next thing Matrix knows is that he comes under heavy gunfire, his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano) has been kidnapped & some sadistic deposed dictator named Arius (Dan Hedaya) is ordering him to assassinate the President of the South/Central American country of Val Verde so he can become president himself & if he doesn't play ball Jenny will die. Matrix isn't happy, no-one messes with his daughter & he sets out to rescue her & make Arius & whoever wants a fight pay...Directed by Mark L. Lester one has to say that Commando is maybe the purest most single minded testosterone filled action film ever, Commando is very nearly the perfect film. After The Terminator (1984) & the Conan flicks Hollywood realised that Schwarzenegger was a money maker & cast him in this his first real leading role, the producers of Commando seem perfectly happy to just dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator & it succeeds perfectly at what it does. The script by Steven E. de Souza exists as nothing more than to get Schwarzenegger into as many action set-pieces as possible, spout the now obligatory one-liners (which are actually quite funny here & Arnie gets to say 'I'll be back') amidst all the destruction & death, to have Schwarzenegger use as much weaponry as possible & to kill as many bad guy's as he can in a large variety of differing ways. The body count in Commando is very impressive, we are talking about Schwarzenegger taking out an entire army by himself & I loved every second of it! Realism wasn't on top the filmmakers priorities, from some really implausible set-pieces like jumping off a moving plane 1000 foot in the air without a parachute & surviving to him ripping a seat out of a car with his bare hands but who cares when a films this much fun? Commando deserves pride of place in any action flick fans VHS/DVD/Blu-Ray collection, you can't call yourself an action film fan unless you love Commando, unless you can quote all the one-liners or unless you haven't seen it at least a dozen times. It's that simple.Director Lester does a good job here, he keeps things moving along at a quick-fire pace with virtually no slack or exposition between the numerous action set-pieces. From car chases to death defying drops from planes to gunfights, shoot-outs, explosions, knife-fights, escapes, assassinations & a final battle scene that isn't too far off World War III. There's a good amount of variety here as well, from out of control jeeps careering down mountainsides to Schwarzenegger escaping a shopping mall full of security guards to a car chase to a the infamous scene inside the tool shed as Arnie uses machetes, forks, axes & saw blades to dispose of a few more soldiers. As a film Commando is extremely violent, there's plenty of blood, mutilation, death & violence. There's no moral message here either, Matrix does what he does because he thinks it's right. Commando is the ultimate no brainer action flick, it has lots of guns, explosions, stunts & people dying. What more do you want? The shopping mall scenes were filmed at Sherman Oaks Galleria in Los Angeles which was later used as the shopping mall in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) while the mansion used in the final shoot-out had been previously used as the location for the final shoot-out in Beverly Hills Cop (1984).With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 Commando didn't have the huge budget that I thought it had, it's well made with good production values though & I think it's safe to say most of the money actually ended up on screen. The acting is nothing to write home about, Schwarzenegger puts in a typically wooden performance although there's a decent supporting cast here. Vernon Wells puts in a really camp performance, that vest like shirt, his accent & bushy moustache makes him one of the gayest villains ever. David Patrick Kelly, Rae Dawn Chong & Bill Duke provide decent support.Commando is as good as the mindless 80's Hollywood action blockbuster got & it's as simple & straight forward as that. If you haven't seen Commando then you cannot call yourself an action fan & you should quite frankly be ashamed of yourself.",Commando

The pace is fast and you get more than your money's worth for 90 minutes. The performances are all great fun. Hedaya and Wells are especially hammy, which is perfect for this type of film.

Initially, this kidnapping caper looks like it's going to follow the surefire formula. Happily, Lester and ""Die Hard"" scenarist Steven E. de Souza avoid this pitfall. Instead of cooperating with the villains in a plan that requires him to kill the president of a South American country, former Army Colonel John Matrix double-crosses the villains. They have kidnapped his daughter and threatened to kill her if Matrix doesn't carry out this mission. Matrix's adversary Bennett (Vernon Wells) has his men accompany Matrix to LAX. One plans to stay with Matrix during an eleven hour plane ride, while the other Sully (Daniel Patrick Kelly of ""48 HRS"")confirms that the plane has taken off. At the last possible moment, Matrix complains to an airline attendant that he is airsick so he can escape from the plane by climbing down through the wheel well of the landing gear. One by one, Matrix eliminates his enemies, culminating in a massive shoot-out at a military barracks with everything getting blown to smithereens.

Any character depth or development is token - the scenes where Matrix interacts with his daughter are cringingly lame and superficial.Then, of course, there's the acting, especially Arnie's. He's not there for his acting ability, and it shows. Alyssa Milano, only 12/13 years old at the time, puts in an okayish performance though.

There were about 3 movies I watched regularly as a kid; ""Star Wars"", ""Willow""...and ""Commando""!Everything about the movie is over-the-top and just plain silly. The story is really weak but it doesn't take away any of the fun. This truly is one of the most entertaining action movies you can watch. The action is really fantastic. Just imaging, Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime with lots of big guns and grenades against a small South American army, completed with some cheesy one-liners. Which action movie fan will not love this movie? The movie is filled with some flaws, plot holes and huge visual mistakes but in a strange way it makes the movie only more enjoyable.The movie is really well cast. Of course Arnold Schwarzenegger is about the biggest action hero you can wish for in a action movie. Almost just as legendary is Vernon Wells as the villain Bennett, his character has really grown into a classic one! His wardrobe is laughable and his Australian accent misplaced but wow what a perfect villain! Dan Hedaya is always great and enjoyable in a villain role. He's one of those actors that basically always play the same character. The rest of the smaller villain roles such as Cooke played by Bill Duke are also highly enjoyable and make the movie a joyful experience time after time. Also keep your eyes and ears open for a small role for the then mostly unknown Bill Paxton.The silly but enjoyable music is from composer James Horner who also was fairly unknown at the time.For the action movie fans this is an ultimate must see and one of the most perfect silly enjoyable action movies you'll ever see.

29,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Highly entertaining... but make sure you know what kind of movie you're in for,6,13 July 2006,"The genre of B-movies has taken a lot of flak... they're simple, they're of low cinematic quality... and let's not even get into how poorly done the vast majority of them are. In spite(or because) of that, many of them end as guilty pleasures and cult classics. This, my friends, is the *ultimate* B-movie. Starring the king of one-liners and senseless violence, Commando is an hour and a half of pure, unadulterated action. Explosions, gunfights and macho-ism all over the place. The trivia informs us that Schwarzenegger kills roughly(meaning it's an *estimate*... there's simply too much high-octane death going on in the film for anyone to provide an accurate count) 78 people in the film... that's almost one person per minute in the film. The plot is thin as paper and close to nonexistent. Backstory is sloppily told with a complete lack of subtlety. The character development is hardly there, and the characters are all completely one-note. The acting is beyond ludicrously bad. The score is mostly overplayed, coupled with a few *really* dated rock & roll songs. But who is looking at or for any of that? On the other hand, the action is great(if the shots are somewhat uninspired... little of the cinematography is exactly extraordinary, or even beyond average) and the one-liners are very funny(good thing, too, as basically half of the dialog consists of them). With this film, you have two choices... go with it, accept that what you're watching has no value other than entertainment... or hate the film and regret watching it. If you should choose the first, you will be treated to Arnold running around with a large arsenal of weapons, gunning down baddies, fighting off less than forthcoming security guards and detonating massive amounts of explosives. This is just too good to miss for any fan of B-movies... remember, you can't say guilty pleasure without the word ""pleasure"".

30,view_and_review,Body Count,7,26 July 2019,"Before she was the daughter of Tony Danza on Who's the Boss Alyssa Milano was Arnold Schwarzenegger's daughter in Commando. We knew full well that his daughter would be in peril at some point in the movie because of the orgy of evidence they gave us that he loved his daughter. The father/daughter montage at the beginning was enough to telegraph to the audience: he will have to rescue her or avenge her.So, when his daughter was kidnapped and John Matrix (Schwarzenegger) had 11 hours to rescue her it came as no surprise. Matrix got suited and booted and went buck wild on 'em. I'm sure the U.S. army really could use a commando like John Matrix. With a confirmed kill count of about 200 and counting the U.S. army would never suffer a casualty. In fact, get a John Matrix and a John Rambo and the U.S. could take down any country at any time.As cool as it was to see Schwarzenegger beat up and blow up bad guys, the movie needed some tweaking. No, we don't have to get rid of the horrible puns, they are Arnie's staple. We did have to get rid of Rae Dawn Chong. She was purely window dressing.Rae Dawn is attractive, but that's about it. Her voice and her acting were nearly enough to derail it all.Another miss was Bennett's fishnet tank top. The main nemesis, Bennett (Vernon Wells) committed a huge fashion faux pas. While John Matrix was in battle gear Bennett was parading around in leather pants and a top that looked like he was caught by a trowler. No wonder Matrix kicked him out of his unit when they were in the army together.In spite of Chong's pitiful performance and Bennett's awful ensemble the movie was good. It was typical 80's action.

Arnold says ""uh-uh"", and proceeds to fight back, leaving a trail of dead bodies, loads of property destruction, and really bad one-liners, all this to the tune of a sax and steel drum score (only in the '80s). It's a straight-up B-movie with A-movie resources. The guys who wrote this script knew they were composing a steaming pile of ridiculousness, but all of the parts come together to form something that actually (but probably shouldn't) works. Arnold's a gun-toting Hercules; he gets up from several car accidents, rips a phone booth from a wall, lugs a tree on his shoulder, and mows down one bad guy after the next without getting shot dead. Not even the police can stop him, with the help of his whiny sidekick. He's totally a comic book character.

The lines and action in Commando makes it a great and fun film to watch.It's about a man, Matrix, played by Arnold, his daughter, played by a very young Alyssa Malono, is kidnapped by terrorists, in particular a dictator who Matrix managed to keep from destroying a country. They give Matrix a chance to save his daughter, by killing the leader of the country the dictator was trying to destroy, since Matrix was so trusted by their leader, it'll make it more controversial. But Matrix has other plans and escapes the airplane, he has 17 hours to save his daughter and kidnaps a sassy flight attendant. But she ends up wanting to help Matrix once she finds out that his daughter is kidnapped, together they work to get back to the dictator's house and save his daughter.The great thing about this film is that Arnold goes though at least 60 extras who are all shooting at him, they miss him and he kills them all. But it's just fun to watch, as unrealistic as it is. My favorite line in Commando is when Matrix is about to throw Sully over a cliff and says ""Remember Sully when I said I'd kill you last?""

The climax, with a whole army of soldiers firing at Schwarzenegger and constantly missing him, even though he doesn't even bother to protect himself, is so moronic that simply ""suspending your disbelief"" is not adequate. It may make you so outraged that you 'll need someone else's help to control yourself and your impulse to smash the TV set.

41,lost-in-limbo,Arnie Unleashed.,7,28 September 2008,"If there were two Arnie movies I would watch regularly as a kid and for what they were it was 'Predator' (1987) and just now 'Commando (1985)'. There are no pretensions here, as director Mark. L Lester gears up a thought-less macho, no-nonsense parade of exciting violence with plenty cracking one-liners along the way. The climax especially, as there's no mercy with a rampant Arnie taking on a small army and watching them drop like flies in a glorious bloodbath of bullets and some garden shed tools. Resourceful. It's a beautiful sight for action fans. It makes the powerfully violent bloodshed in the Rambo films seem meaningful. None of this rapidly flashy edits, too-close camera-work and mechanical staging (found in most latter action films) getting in the way.Lester's no hold-bars approach shoots the vigorous activity well with expansive scope in the devastating set-pieces and exhaustingly taut pacing. Steven E. de Souza's silly script makes little headway, but plays it straight with its welcoming humorous tongue. Quotably campy dialogues and a barrage of puns. The cast do a respectable job. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers the lines and action with heart-pounding authority. Rae Dawn Chong perfectly holds her own and Vernon Wells is eccentrically palatable as Arnie's main foe. Dan Hedaya storms in as the head villain and a cute Alyssa Milano plays Arnie's kidnapped daughter. The support cast are just as interesting with the likes of Bill Duke, David Patrick Kelly, Drew Snyder, Bob Minor, Gary Cervantes, Branscombe Richmond, Matt Landers and a brief Bill Paxton. A muscularly robust engraved music score is courtesy of James Horner.A blood pumping, muscle bound action deliverer that inoffensively comes in leaps and bounds.",Commando
42,Robert_duder,"One of the most terrible, poorly acted, hilarious awesome, best movies I've ever seen!!",7,20 August 2008,"Commando is the prime example of a movie that unintentionally ends up being so bad that is terrific and becomes a classic that will live on and on. This movie was early on in Mr. Schwarzenegger's career and as bad as it seems to be it brought even more success and fame and still to this day seems to be considered one of his best worst stone cold classics. At first glance there is nothing glaringly wrong with Commando. It has a big action star, it has good special effects, a huge body count, and a decent story that follows the whole ""Now it's personal"" idea. So it's just pure magic that the film comes across as a total gag, a laugh a minute farce that actually delivers action but makes you laugh at the complete cheese throughout the entire film. If any man is the king of the action one liners it's Schwarzenegger and nobody pulls them off quite like him and this movie is just packed with them. Some of my favorites include ""I eat Green Beret for breakfast"" and ""I let him go"" (after dropping a guy off a cliff and being asked what he did to him.) The thing is though that despite all the cheese Commando somehow manages to be a half decent action flick as well.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as John Matrix (how wicked cool of a name is that,) and he is the typical tough as nails, former killer for hire but now in hiding kind of guy. Only his softer side comes from having an adorable little girl who obviously leads to his return to action. Schwarzenegger is NOT a bad actor, I happen to think he can act but this was perhaps early on in his career and he was still working out his English but he still looks cool as anything blasting away bad guys with his brute strength. Rae Dawn Chong is the lovely and unwilling sidekick to Schwarzenegger's Matrix. She is a great eighties gal, cute, proper, but can still kick some butt if the time calls for it. She doesn't really mesh all that well with Schwarzenegger making the tiny love story they try to get going kind of silly but she is still good in the role. Classic character actor Dan Hedaya is the evil villain and I think actually gives one of the best performances. His terrible accent is classic and he just looks evil head to toe. He is awesome!! A very young and adorable Alyssa Milano plays Jenny Matrix, and does a great job in the small role. She has great chemistry with Schwarzenegger and is very believable in her role.If you look at director Mark Lester's career list it isn't exactly an award winning line up but he still has been the king of B Movies for nearly two decades and I think Commando might be one of his crowning achievements because many, including me, see it as a classic of the eighties and would watch it again and again. Granted it's never going to blow anyones mind, or make someone say it's the best action film but to many it's just near and dear to our action hearts. Still Schwarzenegger has a great following of fans and if you are one of them or think you could be then Commando is a superb place to start because it is one of the most fun films you'll sit down to watch!! I highly recommend for all it's cheesy goodness!! 7/10",Commando
43,ElMaruecan82,The Quintessential 80's Action Flick ....,7,10 September 2012,"Although it often flirts with the so-bad-it's-good cliché, as a typical 80's action flick, Mark L. Lester ""Commando"" delivers exactly what it's expected and sometimes more, and it's this 'more' that made all the difference and elevated to its fully deserved cult-status. Let's face it, it's impossible to resist to Arnold Schwarzenegger, he might not possess the versatility of a method actor, the wide range of emotions of a Shakespearian comedian, but no one can deny that he was born for the big-screen. Seriously, cinema is not just about having message or displaying emotions, what grabbed people's interest the first time was action. There's no film without action and people would rather sit through an action-film with no substance than an static movie. And Arnold Schwarzenegger, with his muscular physique, his incredible strength, and photogenic face is perfect for whatever Action-film requires: a charismatic hero. Even the Austrian accent that could have been a handicap becomes an unforgettable trademark, making the lines briefer but total dynamite humor-wise. How many times we hear Internet users complaining about an actor's British accent? But there's a general consensus that without his accent, Arnold is not Arnold, I mean Ah-Nuld.And ""Commando"", directed right in the middle of the 80's, is simply the best exaltation of what makes Arnold an unavoidable figure of this flamboyant, where everything is over the top, from his strength to his name, John Matrix, hilariously absurd by today's standard. Of course, to those who doubted it, there is a heart beating behind this mountain of muscles and Matrix is also a caring and loving father, as the magnificent opening credits perfectly captures. A cute and very convincing 13-year old Alyssa Milano plays Jenny Matrix and it's so obvious that Daddy loves his daughter that he'd terminate 300 men if it could save her life. ""Commando"" gets directly to the plot, starting with a series of mysterious killings, and leading us to Matrix' house, where his instructor leaves him his two best men to protect him, of course, they're the best but not as good as matrix, which explains why they got quickly perforated by the baddies when the instructor left, while Matrix had time to hide his daughter because he smelt them coming.Yet they end up kidnapping Jenny. Matrix meets in her room a sneaky little villain sitting lecturing him about the necessity of cooperating. His ""right?"" is retorted by a ""wrong"" punctuated by a bullet through the head. Matrix takes no bullshit and is determined to save his daughter. Somewhat he gets arrested and meets the bad men, the mastermind is an ex-dictator (Dan Hedaya) who orders Matrix to kill his successor and the 'badder' bad guy is one of the film's most original creations; a Freddie Mercury look-alike, wearing black pants, sleeveless T-shirt and a chain-mail vest, talk about a match to macho Arnold. And that's one of the irresistible charms of ""Commando"": it features great villains, and for each one, a memorable confrontation, needless to tell who always wins: in fact, there's one simple pattern that governs the plot, each bad guy gets his comeuppance and inspires at least two or three unforgettable one-liners. When the hostess asks Matrix if he has a carry-on luggage, he points his finger to the black guy who escorts him, I wouldn't mind having Arnold talking every five minutes if it's for comedic gold like this. I won't spoil the script; most of those who read this are already associating images to the 'dead tired' passenger, or the unforgettable statement that follows 'you remember when I told you I'd kill you last'. The film is even aware of its own cleverness when it inserts the character of Rae-Dawn-Shong and her priceless reactions toward the mayhem Matrix causes in his way. She can't even believe the cheesy macho dialog between Arnold and Bill Duke. The film is so 80's, it has Rae-Dawn Shong and by the way whatever happened to her career these last 20 years is a total mystery.""Commando"" is entertaining because of this capability to be enjoyable, smart and not taking itself too seriously, and because of the villains. That might explain how the film kind of loses me in its most defining sequence, the 10-minute during which Matrix eliminates more than 100 soldiers. You know the Golden rule that when the enemy aim at the hero with 1000 bullets, they will miss him while the hero never misses, well, let's say that this device is overused in ""Commando"" more annoyingly than in any other ""Star Wars"" movies. John Matrix is a good guy but body count-wise, he's certainly the most violent character ever played by Arnold. Don't get me wrong, I know that the film had much credibility to rely on in the first place but still, the sequence gets quickly redundant and makes us wait for the ultimate confrontation between Freddie M I mean, Bennett (whoever came with that name is another genius) and Matrix. Matrix vs. Bennett: let's party. And at the end, the film provides the right dose of action, one-liners, adrenalin and testosterone inducing scenes, the whole thing impeccably packaged with a catchy steel drums score. And with his large shoulders, Arnold carries the film as simply as if it was a gigantic tree log, proving again that he was one of the greatest action stars, before the public would ask for another kind of movie hero and allow a film like ""Die Hard"" to put a fresh air in the action/thriller genre.Yet if actions film owe a lot to ""Die Hard"", ""Die Hard"" owe to films like ""Commando"" and to Schwarzenegger. I would even give to Arnold the same compliment I gave to Sidney Poitier or Humphrey Bogart, actors who were often playing the same kind of characters. Arnold might have the most limited range acting-wise, but within his own range, he's unbeatable.",Commando

This action flick aims solely for that 'turn-your-brain-off' guilty pleasure crowd and hits its mark dead-on. It's hard to watch without a smile on your face. Though it is silly - even stupid at times - and incredibly over-the-top, it is also ostentatious, or just toeing that line, which means you can laugh with the picture rather than at it. You do get the undeniable sense that a cringe-worthy one-liner combined with an outlandish, infinite-ammo action-sequence is just kind of awesome. 6/10.",Commando
45,bowmanblue,So simple. So perfect.,8,9 May 2018,"The word 'perfect' may be an odd one to describe an eighties action film where one man effectively takes on an entire army while making wry puns and flexing his biceps. No, I'm not saying that 'Commando' is a perfect film when compared to true cinematic greats, such as the ones we all know and respect like 'Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Empire Strikes Back.'No, I'm saying that 'Commando' is 'perfect' in a different way. As I've already mentioned, it was made in the eighties. And you have to appreciate that, back then, it was a different time period. Women were not always portrayed as strong, independent and many of them needed rescuing from evil bad-guys with odd Anglo-Aussie accents. It is a 'perfect' action film and shouldn't be judged against clearly more 'high-brow' movies.Great films make you think and make you enjoy the character arcs and journeys. Then again, as with 'Commando,' it can also be said that 'great' films can also be sheer entertainment where you can escape 'real life' and simply enjoy the over-the-topness of the action. 'Commando' is definitely 'great' in this category.It could also be classed as Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'first' film. Previously he didn't say too much as the iconic 'Terminator' and the 'Conan' film, he wasn't the wise-cracking action hunk he was destined to become. There is very little back-story to this film. It's about an ex-army soldier (Arnie) who, despite retiring, has his daughter kidnapped by baddies who want him to assassinate a politician. Naturally, he decides on a different method of handling the situation. He wipes out pretty much everyone he comes across with a hail-storm of bullets and bazookas. The film rests firmly on Arnie's broad shoulders and he carries it perfectly. You probably won't remember too many of the supporting cast, apart from the primary antagonist 'Bennett' who I can never work out whether he's trying to be British or Australian and who is as over-the-top as this film would make you expect.Therefore, expect shoot-outs (obviously), car chases, punch-ups and plenty of action. This is an 'action film' through and through. And, like I've said, it's a perfect example of a simple action epic. If you're a Schwarzenegger fan then you probably already own this, but if you like your action films a little over-the-top and a lot tongue-in-cheek, then you should definitely check this one out. It's the ultimate daft popcorn flick totally designed to entertain. Watch it before they remake it.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Commando
46,ericstevenson,Crazy fun,8,10 April 2018,"From what I heard, this was the Arnold Schwarzeneggar movie where he kills the most people. It kind of confused me, because he only had a couple of them for the first hour and nine minutes of the movie. He gets 90% of the kills (probably even more than that, like 95%) in only ten minutes! I thought this was just going to be a dumb action movie. Honestly, it really is smarter than you'd think. There's this one scene where he's about to jump off the wheel of an airplane.I was thinking how dumb it would be because a fall from that height onto the ground would kill him. He instead lands into water. Okay, that's at least slightly more realistic so I'll give the movie props for that. True, it does have fairly hokey dialogue and it's not the most intelligent of movies. Still, it's jam packed with action and the acting's just fine. This is the first time Arnold said, ""I'll be back"". ***",Commando
47,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Unfortunately no one can actually tell you what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself",7,22 July 2000,"Let me just get one thing out of the way first...if you take this film seriously then you are COMPLETELY missing the point.Between Terminator and Predator big Arn made another one-word tough-guy action film that delivered what it promised and then some. Commando is almost tailor-made for Arnie's style of over-the-top action. In fact, I wouldn't say that this film goes over-the-top as much as I would say it launches into the stratosphere, powered by utterly implausible action, corny-as-hell one-liners, a ludicrous plot, and the campiest, least-threatening villain in movie history.Arnie plays John Matrix (yeah, you really did read that correctly) an East-German defector and retired Special Forces Operative (at the age of 37!) who only wishes to live a life of peace with his daughter Chenny in a cozy cabin on Mount Baldy, California (the kind of place you'd expect Larry David to live). Trouble arises when Cooke (the incredible stoic Bill Duke) an emotionless hit-man, starts knocking off Matrix's former comrades. It's all just a ruse to lure him out of hiding and snatch his daughter, a plan 'masterminded' by Bennett, Freddie Mercury's twin brother and the man Matrix kicked out of his unit because 'he enjoyed killing a little too much'.Matrix's mission is to fly out to Val Verde and kill the democratically elected President that he himself helped to install after overthrowing Arius (Dan Heydaya) a brutal dictator. With Chenny being used as blackmail, Matrix has no option but to go along with the plot. But he'll be back sooner than you think as he's the kind of guy who just exits a plane during mid-take-off. After dragging Cindy, an easily excitable flight-attendant (Rae Dawn Chong), along for the ride Matrix pummels his way through Bennett's henchmen and Arius' pissant soldiers one by one, hoping to find Chenny before the plane lands in Val Verde.There's little in this film that makes sense (such as how could a brutal dictator be exiled to an island just a few minutes of the California coast and the Pentagon NOT know about it? and Why is every one of Arius' pissant soldiers the same man in a hat with a fake mustache and gun?) but I'll be damned if it's not entertaining. Almost everything Bennett says is a one-liner for the ages. And don't get me started on the sub-text! He basically kidnaps Chenny (and does the job for free) because he's jealous of her. And if you just listen to his hysterical final confrontation with Matrix, and turn your head away from the screen...tell me that DOESN'T sound like a man-on-man love scene. It honestly would not surprise me if footage of Bennett was played on a constant loop on giant screens in gay night-clubs.James Horner's score is also utterly brilliant, almost never stopping from start to finish, thundering the action along with sharp, punchy strings, eccentric saxophones, and upbeat, funky steel drums. This is truly one of Horner's best efforts, forget Braveheart or Titanic and hunt down the Commando score CD.Mark L. Lester's career sort of withered away after the 80s, but this movie is certainly his crowning achievement and helped solidify Arnie's reputation as an endlessly likable, bigger-than-life movie star. There have been talks of a remake directed by David Ayer and starring Sam Worthington (the names attached at the time of writing). They want to make it more gritty and serious apparently. Are you kidding me? Making Commando more gritty and serious is like adding ketchup to custard in order to make it 'more of a dinner'. It just won't work. And besides, 20th Century Fox virtually remade Commando in 2007 with the dull John Cena flick The Marine (they really stretched their imagination when they came up with THAT title), further proving that a remake is a stupid idea.",Commando
48,atlasmb,Schwarzenegger Surprises,8,21 September 2017,"When Arnold Schwarzenegger first said he wanted to be an actor and had plans to become an international superstar, few thought he would find success. His strong accent seemed an unassailable obstacle. But he found roles that fit him and proved his detractors wrong. He played Conan, a barbarian role that did not require modern day English. Then he played the Terminator--an android whose stilted language was custom made for Arnold's talents.In ""Commando"", he plays John Matrix, an elite ex-commando--originally from Germany--whose talents are desired by evil forces. His speech in this film is still somewhat stilted, but he was on his way to achieving his goals.The plot is classic suspense, complete with a ticking clock countdown that keeps viewers fully engaged in every moment. He has to achieve a nearly impossible task before the clock expires or his daughter will be sacrificed. Alyssa Milano plays the daughter, Jenny, to perfection. And Schwarzenegger convincingly plays the caring father part (compare to Jason Statham in ""Homefront"").Raw Dawn Chong plays Cindy, a flight attendant who reluctantly becomes involved in Matrix's mission, adding more humor to the story. The film never takes itself too seriously, and includes the casual puns we have come to expect from a Schwarzenegger (or James Bond) film, especially when he dispatches an adversary.Matrix is a physical specimen with unbelievable strength and skills. The director stresses this so that we believe it when Matrix uses his incredible power, as when he lifts an occupied phone booth overhead. This is fun stuff.

The first two-thirds of this action thriller is fairly entertaining, as Arnold, assisted by the lovely Miss Chong, plays cat-and-mouse games with the bad guys. Although the story is silly, it has a tongue-in-cheek quality to it, with Arnold delivering a couple of funny lines.

51,The-Sarkologist,A classic Arnie Action Flick,6,15 December 2012,"When I looked at the FAQs for this question on IMDb I discovered a very interesting topic that I never considered in all the other times that I have watched this movie and that was the question as to whether Bennet actually had a homosexual attraction to Matrix which is why he had such a grudge against him. To me this is something that seems to be read into a lot of movies, but when one considers the time that this movie was released, and the fact that there can be such undertones built into characters as well as movies, it is something that is not entirely inconceivable.Basically, John Matrix is an ex-special forces commander that has since retired, however over the period of a week all of his old team are being systematically killed. As it turns out, the former dictator of Val Verde (a fictional Hollywood South American country that actually appears in a number of movies – Die Hard 2, Prededator) hires Bennet, one of Matrix's old team who was kicked out during the operation in Val Verde, to reinstall him, and to do that they kidnap Matrix's daughter and tell him that if he does not kill the president of Val Verde, they will kill his daughter.Now, putting the idea of Bennet's homosexual attraction aside, this movie is little more than a standard action flick, and in fact it is probably quite unrealistic at that. For instance, it is highly doubtful that Matrix could have made that jump from the plane and survived, nor is it realistic that he could have actually taken on the private army of the dictator and not actually sustained a bullet would (or got himself killed). Granted, the guy was a commando, but even though I find it unrealistic that a single commando could take out an entire private army.However, the suggestion regard Bennet's homosexual attraction towards Matrix does add a new twist to the film. The idea is that the reason Bennet was kicked out of the team was not because he found killing too pleasurable (and that could have been a reason as well, by becoming a brutal monster we believed that this was a way to win Matrix's heart) but because of this perceived attraction. Remember that this is a special forces team and these guys spend an awful lot of time together, develop a very strong sense of trust, and are also thrown into intense emotional situations and such attractions are not actually all that surprising.However, it is clear that Matrix is the standard masculine hetrosexual, and, especially in the early eighties, to have another male express their love for you goes beyond a mere insult and actually challenges your masculinity. However we notice that Matrix does not seem to harbour that deep seated hatred for Bennet as Bennet does for Matrix, but once again that is the pain of rejection that Bennet harbours. If you can't love it, then you must kill it. However, the language of the knife, and sticking it in and turning it that Matrix uses at the end suggests that he is well aware of the situation.In a sense this is what one could call an anti-love story. It is not a question of guy gets guy, guy loses guy, and guy gets guy again, but rather it is the idea of defending your masculinity against the challenge that the unwanted attraction brings. In many cases (and even in this film) one must actually have a successful romantic interested, and this does need to serve as a counter balance against the anti-love theme. However, where most rom-coms have the ultimately successful relationship at the forefront, an action film can get away with forcing it to the back.",Commando
52,slightlymad22,Arnies Attempt At A Rambo Movie,6,9 July 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Arnold Schwarzenneger's filmography in order I came to Commando.Plot In A Paragraph: John Matrix (Arnie) A retired elite Black Ops Commando, launches a one man war against a group of South American criminals who have kidnapped his daughter to blackmail him into committing a murder.Arnies attempt at a Rambo style movie is more in the vain of Rambo: First Blood Part 2 than First Blood as Arnie's one man army wipes out an army that is about 100 strong. A cheap and cheesy B movie at its best. It never for one moment has one foot in reality, It's over the top and ridiculous but with Arnie at his charismatic best, it's amazingly quotable and at least entertaining. Despite having his moments, Vernon Wells is awfully miscast and looks ridiculous fighting Arnie. He didn't even come across as crazy enough to be dangerous. I developed quite the crush on Rae Dawn Chong watching this as a kid, and not much has changed. Alyssa Milano is cute enough as Arnie's daughter, but Dan Hedaya is awful. It pains me to say that, as I like him.I'm not sure how lazy James Horner was feeling when he composed the score for this, but it's the same score he used for 48 Hrs. Arnie surprisingly doesn't talk much about Commando in his autobiography Total Recall. He mentions how Joel Silver paid him $1.5 million dollars for the role, and after this movie, he always asked to have one liners put in his movies. And that is about it.

While the plot is not exactly first-rate (it often seems like just an excuse for the action), the film is powered through thanks to the strength of the bond between Arnie and a young Alyssa Milano, cast as his daughter. The first few scenes of the film establish their rather unique connection very well; with no sign of her mother in sight, Milano actually takes to cooking for her father and caring for him, and while it is never really verbalised, the film strongly hints at the two of them having no other close friends or family in the world - and they live in isolation in the mountains no less. The film also benefits from a surprisingly witty script; Arnie's Bond style humorous remarks upon killing various baddies soon tire, however, the banter between Arnie and lead actress Rae Dawn Chong is very good, even if Chong's unlikely accomplice character never quite clicks. There is a lot that one could hold against the film, from Dan Hedaya's ridiculously over-the-top South American accent to the lacking logic with the baddies keeping Milano alive, but the film essentially works on its own terms. It resonates as both a story of fatherly devotion and a story of a well-intentioned man never giving up in a struggle against forces of corruption.",Commando

Instead of feeding the local deer and eating unknown sandwiches, Matrix's past comes back to haunt him: the diabolical Arius (Hedaya) uses a team of mercenaries, including Matrix's former associate, now evil, Bennett (Wells), as well as Sully (Kelly) and Cooke (Duke), among others, to force Matrix to depose a South American dictator so Arius can step in and make himself El Presidente. They've kidnapped Jenny and are forcing Matrix to do the job. Rather than submit to their demands, Matrix uses his considerable skills to turn the tables on the baddies and rescue his daughter. Along the way, he teams up with an unlikely partner, an innocent bystander to all the chaos named Cindy (Chong). John Matrix will prove himself to be the ultimate COMMANDO as he executes his ultimate mission: rescue Jenny! Will he do it? Well, you probably already know...Perhaps the pinnacle of the 80's action boom, the great and mighty Commando is everything an action movie should be...and more! It's a completely entertaining, winning, engrossing, fun spectacle that features non-stop over the top action and hilarious one-liners from Schwarzenegger. Heck, this movie practically invented the ""action movie one-liner"" that we all take for granted today. However, it must be said the Arnie used two of them in The Terminator (1984) as well, but hey, there's plenty to go around. Director Lester even reportedly counts this as his favorite of his own movies, which isn't at all surprising. If I directed it, it would be my favorite too. (One supposes Hitman's Run wouldn't give Commando much of a run for the top position, but Lester also directed the excellent Showdown In Little Tokyo, so that must be a strong #2 in his eyes). 
Commando is a vivid evocation of the 80's rise of Arnie and the action movie in general. It was a great time in movies when if the filmmakers had to make a plot choice between either something logical, or something manly/muscular/action-oriented happening on screen, logic was chucked to the side because it's far less important. Mr. Schwarzenegger remains charming as ever here, whether he's reading Creem magazine and opining about Boy George, or shooting/blowing up/knifing/chopping/slicing/impaling people or getting into car chases or other death-defying stunts. James Horner's score should also be singled out for mention, as it alternates between synth stabs during the action scenes, and the time-honored 80's sax elsewhere. It's really the perfect score and fits the movie well.
Kudos also go to the writers and director Lester for ensuring that this did not turn into an El Presidente Slog, as we call them, which it easily could have. Yet more props go to the excellent (and extensive) stunt performers on the film. As mentioned earlier, Schwarzenegger doesn't have to carry the whole movie on his back like so many logs or phone booths. A top-notch cast is assembled around him to ensure quality all around. Someone should ask Alyssa Milano today what she thinks about Commando. There's even a Rambo-style ""Trautman"" character that doesn't get much screen time, perhaps because he's not as important as all the Arnie action. 
It should go without saying, but the cinematography is crystal-clear as well and you can see everything perfectly (unlike the movies of today). So when you see Arnie blowing up Jeeps with a rocket launcher, you really see Arnie blowing up Jeeps with a rocket launcher. It's all a ton of fun, with a rich vein of humor throughout. The whole outing, seen from today's perspective, harkens back to a time when you really got your money's worth from your movie theater ticket. As a slam-bang, total-entertainment spectacle, you walk away feeling satisfied. Perhaps even uplifted, as Power Station's ""We Fight For Love"" pumps on the soundtrack as the credits roll. The thing is, if you DON'T like Commando, that might be a sign that you need psychological help. Symptoms of NLC (Not Liking Commando) should be listed in the DSM-V Manual of Mental Disorders. If you ever find yourself not liking this movie at any time, for any reason, please consult a medical professional. Commando rules!",Commando
56,Thanos_Alfie,The old Taken...,6,8 March 2021,"""Commando"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a retired Special Forces colonel trying to find his daughter after her abduction by someone he knows. He has to try very hard to locate and save her before it's too late.I liked this movie because it had a nice and interesting plot, some very iconic action scenes which consisted of plenty of suspense. The interpretations of both Arnold Schwarzenegger who played as John Matrix and Dan Hedaya who played as Arius were very good. If you are a fan of action movies I am sure that you will love it and you will watch it again, if you are not a fan then just skip it because you will expect something completely different than what this movie has to offer. Lastly, I have to say that ""Commando"" is a nice action movie and I highly recommend the fans of action movies to watch it.",Commando

He wants Matrix to kill a leader for revenge. So they put him on a plane to set of for his mission. However, he escapes and has 11 hours to rescue his daughter. It's action packed and if you blink, you might miss a great bit of action. With continuous quotes from Terminator and high speed action, this is defiantly worth seeing.",Commando

60,helpless_dancer,Musclebound stud stomps thugs,7,27 March 2004,"Riotous action/comedy featuring a deadly Delta dude who pours a bazooka full of whup-ass on several hundred special forces wannabes who THOUGHT they were bad asses. From the time Matrix drove a GMC down a mountain to the final thrust with former associate Bennett the action never lets down for one second. Ever wondered why these unstoppable action heroes always have a name like Rambo, Hondo or Matrix? For once I'd like to find one of these studs with a handle such as Percival Alloysus Snotgrass. At least then I would then know why he grew up so mean. Even though this was merely another in a long line of mindless action pictures I still enjoyed watching the Govenator punish the arrogant wrongdoers. However, the actor who played Bennett was wrong for this part in my opinion: too soft looking even though he was a big fella. And that chain mail shirt; such pretentious self advertisement. Reminds me of the warrior I saw in a magazine once who died while wearing a t-shirt reading ""Commando"".",Commando

62,Anonymous_Maxine,The ultimate action b-classic!,8,16 June 2008,"When I was a kid I may have been the biggest Commando fan ever. I think I must have watched it at least 30 times or so, I used to watch it every day after school. It is totally cheesy and Arnold is basically a superhero not far removed from Rambo other than by the fact that he has more honorable intentions. Rambo was just mentally destroyed by his military experience, while Schwartzenegger's John Matrix was turned into a nearly perfect military fighting machine but just wanted to live a normal life, but was forced back into action when his daughter is kidnapped.Now that I'm older I notice that it's a little strange that nothing is ever said about Matrix's wife, the mother of his daughter Jenny, an early role for Alyssa Milano. But at any rate, he has certainly done well for himself, living together with Jenny in an absolutely beautiful mountain home with spectacular views of the valley below. We are introduced to John as he is carrying an enormous tree trunk through the woods back towards his house to chop up for firewood. This is how he spends his time, you see. His relationship with his daughter is shown through a cloyingly cheesy musical montage of them skipping along and holding hands and putting ice cream in each other's faces and whatnot. We get it, we get it.But I'll tell you why I love the movie. Jenny is kidnapped by terrorists who try to force him to commit an assassination in order to win her freedom. In one of the best scenes in the movie, Matrix is escorted onto an airplane by one of the terrorists, who he manages to kill before take-off and disguise as a sleeping passenger, and then he makes his way to the undercarriage of the plane, literally tearing through canvas barriers and whatnot, and onto the landing gear, flinging himself off of the plane upon take-off and landing in a swamp below. He then has until the plane lands in the distant country to rescue his daughter before the bad guys learn he wasn't on the plane. Arnold long ago said that guns are his one love in all of his movies, and this one is no exception. I don't know why it is so fascinating to me, because I am not a fan of guns myself, but when he breaks into that gun shop and fills shopping carts with guns and grenades and whatnot, I always feel like a kid in a candy store. There is a slightly awkward relationship between John and Cindy, a woman with whom he had a very rough introduction but who soon sided with him to help him rescue his daughter. There is no chemistry whatsoever between John and Cindy (presenting a convincing romantic relationship has never been one of Arnold's strong points), but they make an interesting enough team as they make their way closer and closer to Bennett, the big bad guy and one of Matrix's old enemies. There are some outstandingly overblown gunfights and explosions and car chases, but it is all so much fun that I can't really say anything bad about it. Like all good bad b-movies, Commando is packed with explosions and firepower and dynamite and guns and grenades and whatnot, but still comes down to a hand to hand knife-fight at the end and is packed with cheesy one-liners, except that some of them in this movie are genuinely entertaining and amusing. This is not high class action, but it is definitely tons of fun!",Commando
63,Vartiainen,One of the key essential Arnold Scwarzenegger movies,8,22 June 2012,"There are action movies that are both smart and full of action. Movies that please both the intellectuals and the adrenaline junkies. This movie is not one of them. It's an action movie that is purely aimed at those that have the ability to turn off their brains and enjoy stuff blowing up without any reason, rhyme or purpose other than to blow stuff up. And, keeping that in mind, it's a great film. It will never be recognized as a cinema masterpiece - mainly because it's pretty much the antithesis of one - but within its own genre it manages to provide us with all the silly yet lovable clichés that we have come to expect from these kinds of slugfests. And it does it with great humour, great style and without taking itself too seriously.There are two key factors that lift this movie above its peers. The first is of course the hulking giant of lovable badassery, Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose character, John Matrix, is perhaps the purest condensation of all the traits that we have come to expect from this man. He's a loving father, yet he's a retired Black Ops colonel. He cracks awful one-liners, but is capable of punching through solid walls. He apparently cannot get hit even though a whole army is shooting at him, yet his action scenes are still thrilling to watch and full of excitement.The second factor is the writing. The dialogue is full of one-liners and zingers, but in this movie they work. They really do. Some of them had me outright laughing. The storyline is also put together rather well. It's slightly clichéd, yes, but the clever twists and imaginative characters make it work - even though the villains especially are kind of hard to take seriously. Nevertheless, the narrative works and manages to keep itself together remarkably well for an action movie.All in all, this is one the greatest action movie that the 80s gave us and one of the most enjoyable movies from Schwarzenegger. Any fan of action movies will surely enjoy it.",Commando
64,gwnightscream,One Of Arnold's Best!,6,10 March 2012,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, Alyssa Milano, Rae Dawn Chong, Vernon Wells and Dan Hedaya star in this 1985 action film. Schwarzenegger (The Terminator) plays John Matrix, an ex special forces colonel who lives with his young daughter, Jenny (Milano) and they're happy. He gets news that his old team is being assassinated and it might be by someone connected. After Jenny is kidnapped, John learns that one of his men, Bennett (Wells) is a traitor working for South American dictator, Arius (Hedaya). John is forced to get on a plane to carry out a mission for Arius in the course of 11 hours, but escapes to rescue Jenny. He finds help from flight attendant, Cindy (Chong) and soon, John becomes a one man killing machine in an explosive showdown against Arius and Bennett. Arnold is great in this and has some humorous one-liners with some reused from ""The Terminator."" James Horner's score is also good as well as the action sequences. This is definitely one of Arnold's best I recommend.",Commando
65,JohnSeal,Thoroughly believable Arnie flick,3,1 July 2000,Arnie blows away a few hundred bad guys and barely gets scratched. Rae Dawn Chong flies a seaplane. Alyssa Milano runs around looking scared. Moviegoers scream at the terrifying sight of the names Joel Silver and Steven E De Souza in the screen credits. Bloated big budget cinema at its most ridiculous.,Commando
66,hellraiser7,Army of One,10,10 January 2020,"This is my seventh favorite film from Arnold but also one of my favorite action films of all time in my book. This is the kind of action film where you really just turn your brain off and have fun and there's nothing wrong with that, which is actually most of the time what I want to do when watching and enjoying movies anyway.The plotline is solid, it's pretty straightforward and simplistic, which I like in most action films because they constantly keep their eye on the ball, the film knows exactly what it wants to be and gives us exactly what we expect and want.The film also has a sense of humor, despite the slight serious nature of the film it also at the same time has a bit aware of its comic bookish nature so it doesn't take itself too seriously. From some bits of physical humor like seeing Matrix shake up the slime bag look out Sully (David Patrick Kelly) in a Phone booth like a shaken Martina, seeing that scene I couldn't help but think ""either Matrix has super strength or that booth and the guy in it aren't very heavy"".But mainly from some of the puns and one lines which are memorable, bad ass, and even hilarious in places which are supplied mainly by Matrix and even the main villain Bennett. What both say in a way makes them both almost live action comic book characters as some of those are the kinds of lines you might sometimes here your heroes and superheroes say.Really like the music score which is done by the late great James Horner. It's exciting and gives the film the right feel that sings action all the way. Really like some of the music in the prepping scene, just seeing Matrix put in that gear, it was just cool because it was a tune that told Matrix is now the Commando and is coming.The cast is good, most consist of familiar names and faces. One of them is Alissa Milano, this film was actually her debut, all I can say is it was one hell of a start for her, and yes I watched the TV show ""Who's the Boss"" and I crushed on the actress. Not much to her character Jenny, but you do get a good feel for Jenny as she feels like any other sweet girl you might have as a kid came across from the playground or next door. I like the fact that she's not helpless, she really can hold her own against danger, despite her bad predicament we see her put in the time to find a way to escape, which is beneficial for her as she's doesn't have much time.Small roles from others like Bill Duke (TV's Black Lighting) and David Patrick Kelly (The Warriors) both actors I really like, and I feel are a bit underrated, both do a good job at playing corrupt slime.Rae Dawn Chong is also pretty good she's the good Samaritan that didn't ask to be one but is; it's ironic she's a flight attendant as she's a person that obviously desires to go places and have adventure, you can say she gets her wish and a lot more. I like that she's useful though not perfect, it was funny when she uses a rocket launcher to bail Matrix out but using the wrong side, which makes sense as she's not trained in using the weapon.Vernon Wells another underrated actor I like who is always good in the villain roles, he plays the main villain Bennett. He's a fun fictional villain and one on my honorable mention list. Really like the look of him from that chain male tang top and that thick mustache which sort of almost makes him look like an evil Super Mario only thing missing is the cap. He's not a deep villain, he's sort of archetypal as he's the typical turn coat. It's really Vernon's performance that makes him stand out, I really like how slightly over the top he can be which I don't mind and sometimes I like certain villains being over the top because it means they have energy.I like how he carries menace from his relentless focused determination in wanting Matrix dead but his way. Also, at the same time he's kind of funny from some of the memorable lines and how he delivers them my favorite line from him is ""Your Getting Old John."" That makes me chuckle a little because as he's saying it, he's moving his hand doing it as if trying to cast a spell.But of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger himself as John Matrix, where it's pretty much Arnold being Arnold. He's just a bad ass all the way, though there is a little depth to his character as we see some of the beginning with his time with his daughter even a little story on how he's the only family she's got which really gives us a little good feel on their family which all the more makes us want him to win, blow all of the profiteers of poison away. Of course as usual he has some of the best memorable lines that are both fun and funny.The action in the film is great, there are some good bits of action in the first and second half of the film, like some of that action at a mall which was cool, I always like action scenes in malls. In a way those parts play out more like a suspense thriller as we see Matrix has a limited amount of time to get the information, he needs to find the bad guys, along with the equipment to fight them.It all leads up to one big pay off which is just awesome as it's one of my favorite battles of all time. It's much like in the films ""A Better Tomorrow 2"" and ""Avengers Endgame"" where those film were all one big build up to the huge climatic battle. I really love how well choregraphed the battle in the film really is, along with blood, explosions, and sound effects which are all practical so no CGI bullcrap in sight.It sort of a live action run and gun video game as we see Matrix is using every weapon in his arsenal and uses them well while constantly on the movie. It's just cool seeing him whip out each kind of gun and making each scum drug solider eat lead, he is just laying waste to them as they are all coming at him left, right, sideways, and byways. Though my favorite part of the battle is just seeing Matrix use garden tools, let's just say Matrix does some gardening.Commando has the right caliber for fun.Rating: 4 stars",Commando
67,Captain_Couth,"A sadistic and sociopathic film, Arnie's best role.",8,25 November 2003,"Commando (1985) is about Matrix, a former covert soldier who's targeted for revenge by one of his deposed enemies. This is one of Arnold's typical 80's roles before he started to make more mainstream films. He's pretty much the whole show in this one. Recycling lines and playing pretty much the same sociopathic character who seems to enjoy maiming, impaling and breaking people's necks and joints. There's one thing that has been worrying me about this picture and it has puzzled me for years, what kind of relationship did Bennent and Matrix have?

However I think that Commando is his most entertaining movie. It has a basic plot but who cares? Commando is just non-stop action and violence, a feast for the senses. Much of it is incredibly far fetched but that only adds to its charm. The script delivers funny one-liners thick and fast, and there are goofs galore, but again this is part of what makes it so enjoyable. Commando boasts good locations, excellent special effects and a great score by James Horner.

It's probably because it's camp, and everyone involved in making it was smirking while they put their own brand of camp into this movie. I had the chance to see the 2007 director's cut version and I was surprised how quickly the movie engaged me from the first few minutes of watching. Some movie just has that kind of speed, and power to pull you into its story. If things were bit campy, one thing this movie is not is a bore. It takes you on a ride from one good scene to another with outrageous, and more outrageous action. Joel Silver always has good picks for main actor and the supporting casts. Rae Dawn Chong looked great, and was perfect side kick as Cindy. Alyssa Milano was also a perfect match as bright eyed, take charge type daughter of Arnold. Arnold of course was more Terminator in this movie than in Terminator, terminating 81 bad guys and taking no prisoners (you should see how some of the guys gets killed by Arnold in this movie).

71,alindsay-al,exactly what you would expect from an arnold action flick,6,18 September 2014,"Now I am a massive fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his films and I respect everything he does with this film in particular being fun but lacking in some things it needed. When his 10 year old daughter Jenny is kidnapped ex military commando John matrix must save her no matter what the cost. Arnold is obviously great in his role as matrix with his all out action style with great one liners he totally fit the mould perfectly for this character. The side cast not so good, the girl that goes around with him is okay with a moment or two of funny stuff but she lacks a lot of substance and depth to her character. His daughter Jenny is also not a great kid actor and she did not impress in this role. The villains were both cartoon like with his ex team mate being weird and eccentric and not in a good way and the south American dictator being as cookie cutter as they get. Its funny I just watched taken and it has a really similar plot to this film but in this film the plot was forgotten about in favour of more action which is a little disappointment giving what I saw in that film. The script is great with Arnold delivering his great lines like always with his usual charisma involved. Obviously with Arnold destroying an army the style is great with the action being top quality.

A tree. A. Tree. Over the next 90 or so minutes he flips one car over and tears the seat out of another, rips a phone booth out of the ground and single handedly defeats an entire army. Is this ridiculous? No, it's the 80s.'Commando' isn't high art, but it's a brutally efficient and well made b-movie whose only agenda is to entertain, and that it does.

73,jimbo-53-186511,"All the ingredients are there, but sadly the dish that's served up isn't quite as good",5,24 September 2015,"Retired Colonel and Specials Ops Commando John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is enjoying his retirement on a secluded mountain range with daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). However, Matrix's retirement is interrupted when a group of mercenaries (and former colleagues) of Matrix kidnap his daughter. The reason? To get Matrix to befriend and kill a president that he had previously encouraged to overthrow another former colleague called Arius (Dan Hedaya). If Matrix fails to comply with this request then those that are holding his daughter will kill her.Like most of Arnie's films this seemed to have all the ingredients to make a suitable staple diet for Arnie's fanbase; it has the one-liners, the sense of fun and the ridiculousness (the scene where Arnie manages to push about 10 security guards out of the way at one time was particularly ludicrous), but yet for me it didn't seem to work quite as well as many of Arnie's other films. I think the main problem here is with the story and as much as I tried to get behind Arnie and his cause I simply found that I couldn't I'm afraid. If we're honest the storyline is quite badly developed; all of Matrix's former colleagues have it in for him, but their reasoning behind this hatred for him is a little vague and is never made clear. This meant that the kidnapping and the entire plot left me a little distanced from the film - I enjoyed it because it was fun and ridiculous, but I wasn't behind it quite as much as I should have been.The second half is also slightly weaker than the first half simply because the wise cracks and humour seemed to disappear in place of a more serious second half where Arnie is 'rescuing' his daughter. The more serious tone it switches to in the second half wouldn't be so bad if it was exciting or provided the viewer with an edge of your seat feeling, but it doesn't and the final sequences are clichéd and predictable - there's only so many times you can see 'invincible' Arnie dodging all manner of bullets before it starts to get a little tiresome.What makes this partially work are some of the performances with Dan Hedaya being particularly good with the screen time that he's given. Arnie is a good presence and is acceptable here. Rae Dawn Chong is a good foil for Schwarzenegger and at least manages to be neither annoying or totally incompetent (although her scene with the missile launcher was genius). James Horner's score is also excellent and is used well at the appropriate moments.Commando is certainly watchable and is definitely a film that fans of Arnie or fans of action films will enjoy. However, the story isn't that involving and the villains motivations are sketchy to say the least. Not bad, but for me this is far from Arnie's best.",Commando

75,barnabyrudge,"Easy to watch, but awfully dumb.",4,6 January 2005,"There's nothing wrong with escapism from time to time, but Commando probably goes a bit too far into fantasy for its own good. Granted, we all need to watch films sometimes purely for the sake of entertainment - not every film has to have the realism of Platoon, the moral dilemmas of Hamlet, or the meticulous accuracy of Gandhi. However, Commando is so uproariously far-fetched, and manoeuvres its hero into such wildly implausible situations, that it ultimately shoots itself in the foot. How can you get even slightly excited when from the very first scenes the good guy is shown to be indestructible?Ex green-beret John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) lives in an isolated mountain lodge with his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). Some years earlier, he was the leader of a crack army unit sent on only the most dangerous of assignments. He is visited by an old pal, Maj. Gen Franklin Kirby (James Olson), who warns him to be on guard as members of his former unit have recently been murdered. Soon, Matrix too finds himself targeted, but the bad guys don't want him dead. Instead, they kidnap his daughter and tell him that in order to get her back he must pull off an assassination for them.The film basically shows how Matrix single-handedly rescues his daughter from a guerrilla army. We are treated to various stunts and scenes of destruction as he races against time to get her back. He leaps from a plane and free-falls hundreds of feet into a swamp; he raids a weapons store and steals an arsenal of weaponry to help him in his quest; he escapes with nary a scratch from an armoured police van which is blown up by a rocket launcher. In an outrageous finale, he wipes out thousands of soldiers who are guarding his daughter's prison. It's all very easy to watch, and since it was never intended to be realistic it feels churlish to knock the film for its low credibility. But even mindless action films have to generate excitement, at least on their own terms. And this one is awfully dumb. The excitement is non-existent, because Arnie is so preposterously invulnerable that even a thousand-man army can't slow him down. Commando is simply empty, mindless spectacle which scores highly on destruction but offers precious little else.",Commando

Yes Stallone was great too then but Schwarzenegger ruled the action genre in my opinion. (Love Stallone though)The kick-ass brutal Action Thriller COMMANDO gave us & Cinema one of the greatest movie bad guys ever with the chained-vest & mustache wearing BENNETT played to absolute perfection by Vernon Wells (Mad Max 2) that guy should've gotten an award for greatest villain of that year or all the 80's? BENNETT has the best lines & is utterly hilarious with strong Australian accent & wild eyes he's a perfect villain & perfect to go up against warrior & Commando John Matrix played equally perfect by Schwarzenegger.I love the story of his old team turned bad guy Mercenaries & how they capture his daughter & set off some of the most exciting action sequences knowm to Cinema!!!!Bill Duke (PREDATOR) is great too as a pimp-looking tough bad guy who has a fantastic fist fight with Matrix through a Motel.The look is beautifully 80's with Neon signs & a gritty look & the music is so Nostalgic & Awesome!!!Truly one of my favourite films of all time & like other Schwarzenegger films such as Predator, Red Heat, The Running Man, Total Recall, Twins, Kindergarten Cop, The Terminator & others that mean alot to me because i grew up watching them & loving them.Commando is great 80's Action Fun with a slaughter of Awesome action scenes & humour.",Commando

78,dworldeater,Commando rocks!,8,25 August 2015,"Commando, along with Stallone's sequel to First Blood, Rambo really set the standard for Hollywood action films in the 1980's. While Commando did not have the budget or as large scale action as Rambo First Blood pt.2. Commando has enough going for it to match up to Stallone's classic as a crowd pleasing action movie in its own right. Arnold rocks the house here as John Matrix, an ex special forces soldier, killing machine and caring dad. He is called into action when his daughter(played by Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped by his enemies and must save her and get some payback in the process. With his massive build, charisma, intense screen presence, unique persona and sense of humor Arnold blows the screen apart while taking down a ton of bad guys. Although by now this blend of fast paced action and humor with tons of one liners has been seen a lot, Commando was pretty original at the time and it set the tone for action movies for the rest of that decade. The support cast is great with Bill Duke and David Patrick Kelly as heavies. Rae Dawn Chong, in addition to being super hot is a very versatile and talented actress. She is great in this and had great chemistry with Arnold. Vernon Wells is awesome here as the very nasty and homoerotic super villain. After getting kicked out of The Village People and John Matrix's elite soldier unit he has a huge grudge and bad attitude. He is set on a collision course with our hero Matrix. Commando is pure entertainment. This one man army movie has much to offer with cool weapons, funny one liners, massive testosterone and a high body count. Arnold is absolutely fantastic and really comes into his own in this role. Commando is essential viewing for action fans and is a classic that should not be missed.",Commando

Hmmm, sounds like the original version of Collateral Damage. Maybe they should have named it Collateral Damage 1, or maybe Predator 1: No Aliens in this film.

This movie ranks with the likes of Last Action Hero and Terminator: a good film but one that is not too memorable. Watch it, it is decent, but don't expect too much.",Commando
80,a_chinn,The most Arnold of all Arnold Schwarzenegger films,7,6 July 2017,"I consider this the most Arnold of all Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, meaning it's a wildly cartoony 1980s style action film. However, if you actually take a close look at Arnold's filmography, he really did not make very many of these types of these overblown actions films that Stallone seemed to endlessly make. Arnold was just coming off his massive success with ""The Terminator"" (this film does have Arnold say ""F— you, a—hole."" and ""I'll be back."") and he no longer had to swing a sword and wear a loincloth to earn his paycheck. In this film he plays John Matrix, a retired special forces commando who's daughter (Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped by South American despot, the great (and badly miscast), Dan Hedaya, so he can blackmail Arnold into working for him. Also working for Hedaya is the terrifically smarmy David Patrick Kelly and Vernon ""The Road Warrior"" Wells as a former commando buddy of Arnold's who's now changed sides. The film was written by Steven E. de Souza, who's 80s action films were always complete comic book fantasies and never made any attempt at realism. He also was probably the worst offender of cheesy one liners after someone is killed or injured by the film's hero. One line from this film, ""Let off some steam."" is probably my all-time favorite bad one-liner in an action film. Another action film cliché is mis-matched partners, which in this film is Arnold being helped by airline stewardess Rae Dawn Chong, who actually does a very good job of being funny and charming and more of a real person trapped in an overblown action film. You also get Bill Duke as a thug, and very small early role for Chelsea Field and Bill Paxton. Produced by Joel Silver (""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Die Hard,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc.), photographed by Matthew F. Leonetti (""Red Heat,"" ""Strange Days,"" ""Dawn of the Dead""), and edited by Mark Goldblatt (""Rambo: First Blood Park II,"" ""The Terminator 1 & 2,"" ""The Last Boy Scout""), this film has quite an action film pedigree that's hard to beat. You also get a classic muscular 80s style score from composer James Horner, who first cut his teeth in the business composing scores for action, horror, and sci-fi films, and later went on to work on more prestige of projects like ""Field of Dreams,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""Apollo 13,"" and ""Glory."" If I'm not mistaken, I think I've heard this score re-used in a number of Hong Kong action films. I think my main complaint about this film is that director Mark L. Lester does not really bring a lot to the picture. The action is lacking any kind of excitement or suspense. There are some good hand- to-hand fight sequences, but I think that's more to the credit of the fight choreographers than Lester. I will give Lester credit for some ironic laughs, such as Arnold's initial reveal, which is done by a close-up shot of big boots, a close-up of a big chainsaw, a close-up of a big bicep, back to the boots again, and then the other big bicep, and finally Arnold's big head carrying a big log on his shoulder. I was also amused by a charmingly dated pre-cell phone scene where a David Patrick Kelly has to steal a quarter and race to a phone booth to make a call before before Arnold can stop him. Overall, this is a complete cheesy action film, but Arnold is good in the lead and outside of bland direction is a well crafted action film.",Commando

82,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A film that's too silly & is filled with too much over the top garbage,3,20 December 2012,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is known to make fun and exciting action films. The best example would be based off ""The Terminator"" movies, but what ever appealed to him here in this film I'll never know. Schwarzenegger is John Matrix, an ex-military man who is just trying to get away from his previous career and live with his daughter, Jenny (Alyssa Milano). However, Matrix's past creeps up on him and his daughter is kidnapped and from there he vows to find any possible way of getting her back.Boy is Schwarzenegger one crazy hell of a father and this is where the movie goes downhill. To start off, it doesn't even make sense that John Matrix wants to live a normal life because if he did, he wouldn't be holding onto a shed full of machine guns. Yeah, he really let go of his career. Everything that Schwarzenegger does when it comes to action in this film is more berserk than constructed sequences. And just like some poorly made video game, Matrix is running around killing thousands of enemy soldiers all simultaneously shooting at him and he's never badly hit once.Along his mad dash to find his kidnapped daughter, Matrix runs into an innocent bystander named Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) whom he convinces about the situation that he was forced into. Unfortunately Chong really doesn't give a believable performance. Not to mention but her character did not even excel the picture. She was there more for laughs,...for example, she's always worried and asking a lot of questions. I'm sure if her character was left out of the script, John Matrix still could have rescued his daughter no problem.The villain behind Jenny's kidnapping is Arius played by Dan Hedaya who also doesn't give a real compelling show. His tone of voice doesn't change once during the whole movie. Boring. Vernon Wells plays Bennett, an egotistical ex-militant who once fought along side Matrix but then had a change in heart. It's one thing to see the protagonist, who is usually smaller, fight the antagonist, who is usually bigger. An example like this would be Sylvester Stallone's Cobra (1986). But here you have Schwarzenegger (HUGE) and Vernon Wells (forget small, he's not even muscular) go head-to-head. Is there even a question to who will win?....No!Let's not forget now about continuity, dialog and film music. The continuity in this film is horrendous. There are several scenes where it is blatantly obvious that in between different cuts, there are two of the same different objects. Could it be anymore obvious? And how about that dialog? Much of it was just unnecessary. All Schwarzenegger does is make statements that are already known or obviously true. He drops a man,...his description, ""I let him go"",....really? Like the audience doesn't know that?Lastly, the most shocking part is the score composed by James Horner. Yes, the composer to Glory (1989), The Rocketeer (1991), The Mask of Zorro (1998), Bicentennial Man (1999), etc., which are all moving scores creates this synth type of music with steel drums that never end. It is more painful than screeching violins because it creates no tone for the scenes and there are times where there is no music at all where the points of conflict a rise the most. Truly disappointing experience from Horner.Nothing works in this Schwarzenegger vehicle. The actors do not fit their characters, the music is poor and the action is brain-dead.",Commando
83,PredragReviews,"""I eat green berets for breakfast""",8,7 May 2016,"Commando is a very dated and extremely entertaining action film full of great stunts, one liners and cheesy, gap-toothed Arnie goodness. Rae Dawn Chong plays a typical 1980s sidekick with some still-funny one liners (and some real groaners), Dan Hedaya (apparently in shoe polish) plays a deposed dictator from Val Verde (the same fictional Central American country from Predator and Die Hard 2), Vernon Wells (Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, Weird Science) plays Bennett, David Patrick Kelly oozes slime as Sully, some guy plays the Richard Crenna-role from Rambo and Bill Paxton shows up in a brief cameo (Arnie killed him in Terminator, and threatened him later in True Lies). All in all, a good cast.Arnold Schwarzenegger is Col. John Matrix, recently retired from some sort of military special-ops career (in which he was, of course, the best there was), and now living in a cabin in the hills with his little girl (Alyssa Milano). She'll be crushed if he has to go back into action again, and he promises he won't. But somebody is killing the members of his old unit one by one, and they may be coming for him next. Sure enough, not long into the film, his daughter has been kidnapped. And the bad guys explain that they'll return her if he'll just perform one teeny-tiny little assassination... That's the setup; the rest of the plot consists primarily of Arnold kicking butt. That's what you wanted to see, isn't it? The plot may be predictable, the action maybe cheesy, the main villain may look like Freddy Mercury on steroids, the dialogue may not be Shakespearean... but it's a riot of a film that should be enjoyed for what it is!

84,Sandcooler,This movie cures cancer,8,1 April 2013,"Ah, the 1980s. I don't remember much about them because I wasn't born yet, but ""Commando"" is definitely one of my favorite ways of making up for lost time. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure, largely because this is just Schwarzenegger at his most clichéd. Every easy joke you can make about the Arnie persona is based on this film, it's probably the closest you're ever going to get to seeing an actual McBain movie. It's hard to really tell what my favorite part is. Is it the gigantic Schwarzenegger hiding behind things that are barely half his size in broad daylight? Is it the part where an untrained 80 pound girl fires a rocket launcher without feeling any kind of recoil? Is it the detective angle of the story, which basically just throws every clue straight into our hero's lap? Is it the part where Arnold crawls out of a swamp completely dry? ""Commando"" is basically flavor country. It also has the benefit of having one of the best finales I've ever seen, even including an end fight that is an actual fight. The average action movie sees the main villain as nothing more than the punching bag that dies last, but thankfully there's nothing average about ""Commando"".

85,Chase_Witherspoon,"You're a funny guy, so I'll kill you last",6,29 September 2012,"""Commando"" is one of those familiar, formula-driven action-revenge pictures of which you never tire; it plays often in reruns and it's easy viewing for its predictability, popular clichés and high-speed action sequences. Schwarzenegger is a retired special forces soldier living in a remote, mountain retreat whose daughter is abducted by a twisted former colleague (Wells). Predictably, Arnie senses that if you want the job done right, you'd better do it yourself and ends up making short work of his adversaries, many and varied though they may be, none are up to the task.Good cast and taut direction from veteran Mark L. Lester keeps the momentum constant as such you won't need to wait long before the next villain gets his comeuppance, each with a fitting conclusion, and some delivered with typical black humour (""I had to let him go"", ""don't wake my friend, he's dead tired"" etc). James Olson, Dan Hedaya, Drew Snyder and small roles for Bill Duke and the ubiquitous stunt-actor Bob Minor round-off a solid cast of victims for our unstoppable hero to conquer.If you like the traditional revenge-at-all-costs action-thrillers, then this trademark Arnie picture will never grow old, incorporating a vast array of motifs and an endless supply of ammunition.

He kidnaps a Commando's (Arnold) daughter (a tiny Alyssa Milano) and demands his military talents as ransom for her life. The middle section of the movie rattles off a series of implausible events and a deranged plot line as Arnold tries to turn the tables, featuring shopping mall shoot-outs, leaps from moving airplanes, kidnapped girls who happen to be able to fly planes and shoot missile launchers helping Arnold, and other chaotic pandemonium that hits you in rapid succession.But if you're able to keep from laughing yourself to death at this over-the-top nonsense, the closing scene is one for the ages of action movies. Get a scorecard, use the pause button frequently, and count the multitude of bodies. This mayhem goes on for almost 30 minutes as an island full of cigar-smoking soldiers (all resembling Fidel Castro) face off with Arnold running amok.More of a comedy than an action movie after a while; but lots of fun for action movie fans.

89,coltras35,Watch this comic book-style action fest - and let off some steam!!,10,29 April 2021,"When citing Arnie's best films the contenders are always Terminator 2 or Predator, but not to take anything away from those 80's classics, Commando for me, is his best film. Tongue-in-cheek, a muscular and frantic plot filled with mind-numbing action. The one liners are just the icing on the cake( ""Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last? I lied""). I have seen this film so many times, and never get bored of it. The pacing is nifty as a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.The story is quite straightforward. Arnie plays John Matrix, a former leader of a special commando strike force who is forced back into action when his young daughter is kidnapped. The bad guys want him to assassinate the president or else his daughter dies. To find her, Matrix has to fight his way through an array of punks, killers, one of his former commandos ( an OTT bad guy who wants to shoot Matrix, eh, lower down), and a fully equipped private army. With the help of a feisty stewardess and an old friend, Matrix has only a few hours to overcome his greatest challenge: finding his daughter before she's killed.The exciting part of the film is the fact whether the kidnappers will realise that he isn't on the plane with their cohort heading to the assassination point, and whether he could reach his daughter in time. It's a gung-ho action thriller, a boy's own adventure pulped with comic book explosions and shootouts. Arnie is like an action-figure, and in the finale taking on so many soldiers. It's a fantasy, fun and addictive- and the music soundtrack ""we fight for love by Power station"" rounds off the ending brilliantly. A feel good film that helps let off steam ( just like how the OTT bad guy did in the end).",Commando
90,Howlin Wolf,"He eats green berets for breakfast, and right now he... has indigestion.",7,19 June 2007,"... OK, so that isn't the line, but ""Commando"" is so near the summit of the 'stupidly enjoyable' league table that you almost feel the altered quote would fit just as well. Previous to 1988 there were really only two types of Arnold movie; these were 'Sword n Sorcery' and 'One Man Army'. ""Commando"" is a textbook example taken from the latter group, so obviously it's important that we have a montage over the beginning credits showing just how formidable he is. As seen clearly, he can lift what looks like a whole tree using just the one arm, so only a group of fools would start any trouble. These fools come in the form of 'The Freddie Mercury Fan Club', otherwise known as Bennett & Co...So sit back in delight for an orgy of death as our ruthless military man sets about dispatching his daughter's kidnappers in hilariously inventive ways. Apart from seeing him apply camouflage makeup (the ONLY kind that isn't 'girlie', obviously... !) there really isn't much more to it, but gosh darn it all if it isn't so viscerally entertaining nevertheless.

91,punishmentpark,"Shooting, fighting, blowing up stuff, saying dumb things and looking very intense all the way through.",5,27 January 2016,"A thoroughly overrated piece of B-film action - and I like the genre! People here and elsewhere give this 8, 9 or even 10 of 10, stating that this is a 'true gem' or 'comedy gold'... I beg to differ. Sure, Arnold delivers loads of bone dry one-liners some of which will make you smirk at times, but there's better stuff around. Action-wise, there's a lot of laughable (not in the good sense) stuff, here. Some of it is pretty cool, though, like Rae Dawn Chong blowing up the police arrest van, but when Arnold struts around that garden, simply firing off rounds without even once getting hit, things just get way too silly.The opening scene, in which Arnold and Alyssa analyze modern day music while being as close as a father and daughter can possibly be (or closer?), is beyond bad taste. Arnold's former boss is a non-character of the highest order, as are most of the baddies as well (Bennett was funny, though). There is just hardly anything that the film has going for it. The action scenes are poorly choreographed, executed and filmed, sidekick Rae Dawn Chong is cute, but can not act at all (check her scene when she is outraged next to Arnold in the car!) and there is just nothing in the story that gets me to sympathize with the main characters. Although the basic premise (eleven hours to save his daughter while your enemy thinks you're on a plane) is cool enough. It's just some shooting, fighting, blowing up stuff, saying dumb things and looking very intense all the way through, with hardly any nudity to make up for it. I sound really negative, don't I?

Arnie can do literally anything in this film, and that too is made believable by his charm and physique. And as for the action, well this film has the best explosions I have ever seen in my life!

93,TheUnknown837-1,"the best one-liners in a movie that is ludicrously silly, but a lot of fun",7,18 October 2008,"""Commando"", starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in another mediocre performance, is by no way a good movie. And there's really only two things in this film that I can say are positive about it. One, it has the greatest collection of one-liners ever uttered in a single film and two, it's a ton of campy fun.Schwarzenegger plays a retired military human killing machine whose daughter is kidnapped by some of his former enemies. They hold her hostage and threaten to kill her unless he assassinates a friend of his', who has gotten into government position in a foreign Hispanic country. Arnie escapes oversight of his enemy and plots to get his daughter back...by any means necessary. Along the way, he picks up an assistant: a airliner hostess (Rae Dawn Chong) and together, they set out to rescue the girl from her captors.Like I said, ""Commando"" is not a good movie. The acting is mixed, the characters innate and goofy, the believability is low-key, and the really funny thing is that although this movie is incredibly silly and goofy, it's trying to be a big bloody serious gangster movie with large amounts of cussing, violence, killings, and etcetera. And yet, somehow, it works without becoming embarrassing. This movie is just a ton of low-budget entertainment and it doesn't fail to make us laugh and keep us watching.",Commando
94,baumer,Remember Sully when I promised to kill you last? That's right Matrix you did. I lied!!,8,21 September 1999,"When I was growing up, I had two heroes on the big screen.  One was Rambo and the other was Indiana Jones.  They were two relentless characters that would never stop, never give up and their tenacity was stuff that kids or teens would swear by.  When we were playing adventure games those were the two characters that always got chosen to play first.  But the same year that Rambo II came out, a new hero was born.  We all knew who Arnold was, he was the Terminator.  But when Commando was released, one of my best friends said to me, "" Hey Dan, I think this guy could take Rambo.""  After all Matrix says to Cook, "" I eat green berets for breakfast and right now I'm very hungry!"" I would maybe have to concur.  Matrix was the toughest man alive ( until MacGyver came out ).  And Commando is one of the best memories that I have as a young man growing up in the 80's.  Besides it being a damn fine, fun movie, it also has two other elements that began to teach me about film. First a young Bill Paxton was in it and secondly I began to notice the name Joel Silver.  He is the producer extraordinaire that is the man behind hits like Die Hard, Predator, Weird Science and more recently The Matrix.  Now I look for his name in the producers chair and when he is on that poster as producer, I'll run to that movie.Commando doesn't pretend to be something that it's not.  The Rambo character was more into politics and it took itself a little more seriously than Commando did and that's fine.  But this film is nothing but entertainment. It starts fast and violent and it ends hard and violent.  You think Rambo kills a lot in Rambo, then count the bodies in this one.  But it is so much fun because not only does Arnold have fun with it, but the script, as cheesy as it may seem is actually brilliant.  Arnold's one liners are now a staple of his film persona and I think you can look at this film as the root of that persona.  For example "" Any carry on luggage? "" the stewardess asks Arnold, "" Just him,"" he replies pointing at the thug that is escorting him onto the plane.  After he beats the hell out of Bill Duke he says, "" We'll take Cooks car, he won't be needing it.""  And of course, to Bennett when they are about to fight mano a mano, ""Come on Bennett, let's party!"" Commando is littered with small moments like that you won't soon forget.  It has stayed with me for 15 years and me and my friends rent it every now and again to laugh and cheer.  If this a film that you haven't seen yet, then do so.  If you haven't seen this film in quite a while, you should treat yourself to it.  It is fun fun and more fun.  And this is the first film that Arnold reprises his famous line "" I'll be back!""

95,Joxerlives,Beyond parody 80s action-fest!,6,28 April 2013,"Just caught this film the other night and my lord, it was just as I remembered it. Of course I remembered it as a ridiculously overblown and ridiculous action film aimed squarely at 15 year olds so that's not necessarily a good thing. Where to begin? The plot is utterly ludicrous, Arnold's acting is terrible even though the script doesn't exactly require him to do that much. The central message of the final shooutout is that bullets are totally ineffective against you as long as your muscles are really, really big (for the record Claymore mines do not explode in big balls of fire, they're more like setting of 20 shotgun cartridges at once. Plus LAW rockets would punch a hole in a gate but not blow it to matchwood).When you compare this to The Terminator which had just been released a year previously it truly pales in comparison. At one point one of the female characters remarks 'I can't believe this macho bullsh*t!"" and she's not wrong. On the good points did you spot Bill Paxton (who played one of the punks killed by the Terminator and would go on to co-star with Schwarzeneger in True Lies) as the coastguard radar operator? Also writer/director Bill Duke who'd go on to star with him in Predator as the ex-Green Beret he fights in the hotel room? An almost unrecognisable Alyssa Milano as his daughter who'd grow up and go on to fame and fortune as a fanboy lust goddess in Charmed (interestingly the same thing would happen to Eliza Dushku who plays Armold's daughter in True Lies and go on to star in Buffy/Angel). Rae Dawn Chong is OK in her role and everyone else majorly OTT. Watching it now you just can't fail to see the gay subtext between Matrix and Bennet, it's so blatant you wonder did the writers deliberately sneak it in as a joke? The 'arming up' scene is so bombastic it borders on the fetishistic and you can see where Hot Shots Part Deux got its' source material from.To sum up, entertaining yes but leave your brain at home.",Commando

Actually, there are a lot of films with so-called great actors that suck eggs! There are very few truly great films, and probably the fewest were made in the 80s. But the 80s was the Entertainment Decade, as I like to call it. There were a lot of quickly made, plot less movies that just plain entertained. And COMMANDO is one of them! COMMANDO is classic Arnold Schwarzenegger, with all the non-stop action, fast pace, and typical Arnold puns and of course the obligatory ""I'll be back!"" line. For a mid-80s movie, it still holds up well as a great action film. When you get action, and that's what you mostly get, it is truly well-staged and entertaining. The early action scene at the mall where Arnie takes out all those security bozos still makes me laugh, smile, and root to this day! The additional joy of this movie is that it's a laugh riot! And that's a good thing. It doesn't take itself seriously: it just moves, moves, moves without ever taking a breath! Even when it appears to stall to try to have meaningful dialogue, it really doesn't. Every line of dialogue actually moves the plot along: nothing wasted. An adrenaline rush of a movie!COMMANDO tells the story of John Matrix (Arnie himself), a retired special operative for some secret gov't unit whose daughter is kidnapped by a deposed South American dictator Arius (the reliable acting stalwart Dan Hedaya sporting an, errr, Hispanic accent?). Arius' number one goon is Bennett (British actor Vernon Wells), a former marine buddy of Matrix who has turned to the other side. Frankly, the fact that Bennett is supposed to be Matrix military and physical equal is downright laughable, but thankfully, the climactic mano-a-mano fight doesn't take too long. Matrix defies orders and instead opts to save his daughter instead of taking the chance that they will not kill her if he kills the dictator. He has 11 hours to save his daughter before they will kill her. Tick tock...Tick tock.Along the way, Matrix gets help from airline stewardess (just go with it!) Cindy (well played by Rae Dawn Chong in the typical female co-star role, but she makes the most of it). Chong is really fresh and funny and seems to understand that it's just a movie! It's a lot of fun watching Arnie take down all these goons, thugs, and 'soldiers' in order to save his daughter. Of course, being an 80s fluff movie, it ends with some driving, forgettable rock tune that has nothing to do with the score you've heard during the entire film (which is actually pretty memorable)!

And if that sounds like a movie description more than Arnie's character traits, you must have seen ""Commando"".No one handles mayhem like Arnold, and there's plenty to handle here: from every firearm ever invented down to garden tools, table legs and a good piece of lead pipe, the competition is mowed down right and left until the only one left standing is....Well, DUH!Guys, you want the women to clear out of the room fast?  Pop in ""Commando"" and BOOM: instant Guy's Night!  Guns, explosions, one-liners by the truckloads and Arnold amidst it all, the conquering hero.

The plot is thinner than a single human hair, but very straightforward and non-fussy, and the script is filled with cheesy one liners, and if anyone takes this even slightly seriously then they are total fools. Vernon Wells as the back stabbing villain is one of the funniest characters in action movie history. He's just so over-the-top hyper macho that how he could not be considered anything other than comical is impossible to even imagine. Combine all the cheeseyness of the script, the music, and performances, and you're left with one of the least demanding, yet so very fun action flicks ever.",Commando
100,ivo-cobra8,One of the best Action movies made in the 80's,10,15 October 2015,"Commando (1985) It is one of the best a American action thriller film out there made in the world. The film is Directed by Mark L. Lester, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rae Dawn Chong.Released in 1985, 'Commando' starred action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger as a retired Delta Force operative who must rescue his daughter from the mercenaries who killed his entire team. Also starring a young Alyssa Milano and Rae Dawn Chong, 'Commando' was yet another hit for Schwarzenegger. It is been 30 years and it is still consider it as the one of most best Action war flicks in the world out there. I eat green berets for breakfast, and right now I am very hungry. Arnold Schwarzenegger played Colonel John Matrix, a previous Delta Force operative who must rescue his daughter from the mercenaries who killed the other members of his unit. Schwarzenegger previously rose to fame with roles in the 'Conan' films and 'The Terminator.'John Matrix, ultimate soldier and one-man army. Matrix, the former leader of a special commando strike force that always got the toughest jobs done, is forced back into action when his young daughter (Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped. To find her, Matrix has to fight his way through an array of punks, killers, one of his former commandos, and a fully equipped private army. With the help of a feisty stewardess (Rae Dawn Chong) and an old friend, Matrix has only a few hours to overcome his greatest challenge: finding his daughter before she's killed.In the beginning, there was the masterpiece known as Commando. And the God of '80s Action Excess did look upon it and see that it was good. And all did Arnold Schwarzenegger massacre hundreds of mercenaries in displays of awesome ultra-violence, and Alyssa Milano did rejoice.After the triple play of The Terminator and both Conan films, Arnold Schwarzenegger graduated to top billing with Commando; a classic '80s action movie which delivers tons of explosions, violence and guns, in addition to containing an assortment of evil villains, cheesy one-liners, big guns, bigger guns and enough dead bodies to keep a mortician's convention busy for days. It was produced by illustrious action super-producer Joel Silver and written by distinguished action writer Steven E. de Souza, not to mention that the primary star is none other than the iconic Arnie. On any level above that of red-faced guilty pleasure, there's simply no way to defend Commando. It's a gloriously primitive and action vehicle which makes absolutely no bones about its absurdity. It never pretends to be anything other than a simple-minded exercise in vicarious violence. Its heart and soul is best by a line of dialogue – a female character, while witnessing two macho behemoths engaged in mano-a-mano fisticuffs, exclaims ""These guys eat too much red meat!""Arnold Schwarzenegger is a delicate talent to work with. If a director tries to make the personality of a character he portrays too complex, the result will be confusion or, at best, unintended hilarity. Mr. Schwarzenegger first appears in ''Commando'' in parts - one huge bicep and then another; when the camera pulls back he is seen to be carrying an ax and the trunk of a large tree down a mountainside to his house. And the early scenes in which Mr. Schwarzenegger, as Col. John Matrix, a retired commando, is at home with his daughter (Alyssa Milano) have an underlying current of humor - it is clear the child would be as comfortable cuddling up to a polar bear.Great and very intelligent review/retrospective of one of the most badass action movie classics of all times! I love this movie to death and i will always defend it from people who make fun of movies such as this one. I would personally prefer dozens of movies like Commando and Cobra rather than 90% of action movies today. Badassssssss Action flick, it fast Entertained , it has gore of action, tons of violence,The film is violent, and somewhat bloody. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well.

101,Vivekmaru45,This is the way I like Arnold: pumped up and ready for action.,10,31 December 2010,"Another great Arnold film along with Predator,The Terminator, The Running Man and Conan The Barbarian.Veteran director Mark L. Lester (Firestarter, Class of 1984/99, Armed and Dangerous, Night of the Running Man, Showdown in Little Tokyo) directs his best ever film (to my belief). Plot: (Schwarzenegger) is informed by Major General Franklin Kirby (Olson) that all the other members of his unit have been killed by unknown mercenaries. Despite being given protection, the mercenaries, whose ranks include Bennett (Wells), a former member of Matrix's team fired for excessive brutality and presumed killed in the preceding assassinations, attack Matrix's secluded mountain home and kill the guards, kidnapping his daughter Jenny (Milano) in the process. When Matrix gives chase, he is also captured.Bennett explains that Matrix is needed to carry out a political assassination for Arius (Hedaya) (who calls himself ""El Presidente"") and his army of former U.S. soldiers and mercenaries. Arius is a warlord and dictator who was previously overthrown by Matrix. He now wishes to lead a military coup in his home country, Val Verde, and reasons that Matrix's familiarity with the country's new leader will aid in an assassination attempt. As Arius has Jenny, Matrix reluctantly accepts the demand.[2]After boarding an airplane to take him to Val Verde, Matrix instead kills his guard and jumps into a swamp just as the plane is taking off from the runway, then sets his watch timer for the approximate time of the flight. Subsequently, he commandeers an off-duty flight attendant Cindy's (Chong) car and eventually manages to enlist her help. After confronting (and killing) two of the mercenaries, Matrix learns where Arius' mansion is located (and where Jenny is presumably being held), he breaks into a surplus store and steals a one-man arsenal of both small arms and heavy weapons. With Cindy's complicit help, he escapes from the police who have arrested him for breaking and entering the surplus army store.After commandeering a seaplane from a nearby marina run by Arius, Matrix and Cindy land the plane off the coast of the island where Arius is located. Matrix instructs Cindy to contact General Kirby and then proceeds to Arius' villa, fighting and killing Arius' private army on the way. He subsequently confronts and kills Arius in a gunfight.Matrix finds Jenny in the basement, but he is shot in the arm by Bennett. Matrix then taunts Bennett into facing him in a knife fight, an invitation Bennett cannot resist. After a fierce struggle, Matrix gains the upper hand and Bennett, defeated, reaches for a machine pistol, but is impaled with a steel pipe by Matrix before he can fire. After Kirby arrives with a military detachment, he offers Matrix another term of service in the Force. Matrix, however, declines and he, Cindy, and Jenny fly off back home.A Never-made Sequel: A sequel was written by De Souza and Frank Darabont, based on the 1979 book Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp (which is, itself, a sequel to his 1966 book The Detective, made into a film in 1968 featuring Frank Sinatra and Lee Remick), but Schwarzenegger was not interested in making a sequel (HOW DUMB CAN YOU GET???) as his previous sequel ""Conan the Destroyer"" had bombed at the box office (I personally liked Conan The Destroyer. What Gives???). The script was reworked with a new central character, eventually played by Bruce Willis, and was retitled ""DIE HARD"".Conclusion: you don't need a brain cell to figure out that this is a great buy for your movie-shelf.",Commando
102,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Goofy action crap... guys only!,6,9 April 2005,"Arnold plays a retired commando, who ""eats green berets for breakfast,"" but now is thrust back into action as his daughter, young Allysa Milano, is kidnapped by some cardboard cut out bad-guys. The result is pretty much an action vehicle for Arnie to show off what he does best: kick ass.This is just about as ridiculous as 80s action movies got. This flick is practically a cartoon with it cheesy plot and well... cartoon-like action. Arnie picks up a guy with one hand and holds him over a cliff, removes a car seat with no difficulty, takes out an entire base of soldiers with a few weapons that he has (his secret: infinite ammo!), he picks up a phone booth with a guy in it and throws it (!!), and all the time he manages to crack one-liners. I mean this movie is just flat out whacked. It manages to work only because of Arnold in the lead role, no one else could pull of such slapstick/action and make it entertaining at the same time. The main strike against this movie is that your brain must be shut off to watch. Just remember to turn it on after you're done. 6/10Rated R: profanity and a lot of violence",Commando

A beefed up, army vet is thrust into battle and slays everything in sight. The major difference is that Commando is one of those silly Arnold Schwarzenegger flicks with cheesy one liners and boatloads of implausibility. It doesn't take itself half as seriously as Rambo. In Commando, Schwarz takes on a displaced Latin American dictator and an old commando buddy who have kidnapped his daughter to make him assassinate the new leader of said displaced dictator's country. Dan Hedaya(The First Wives Club, Shaft) and Vernon Wells(The Road Warrior) are the head villains along with David Patrick Kelly(48 Hours) and Bill Duke(Predator). Young Alyssa Milano rounds out the nice B cast. James Horner supplies one of his typically rousing scores.

Unfortunately for me, I found that the violence got somewhat boring, and that the jokes were more miss than hit.  It started off rather well, and I must admit that Schwarzenegger and Chong make a terrific duo.  However, the violence got old pretty fast, and since the final result was obvious all along, I needed some particularly enjoyable action or comedy to make up for the lack of suspense.  This movie almost succeeded, but in the end, it was nothing more than a decent time-killer.",Commando

James Cameron, Ridley Scott and John Carpenter were making film history with the likes of ""Aliens"" (1986), ""Terminator"" (1984), ""Blade Runner"" (1983) and ""The Thing"" (1982). In addition, of course, there was George Lucas with Star Wars in '80 and '83, and Spielberg with the Indiana Jones trilogy. Amongst all that greatness, one can only wonder how a film such as this along.It's certainly not dynamic, overly-cliché, yes, and definitely not up for best score. What it does bring to the table is a juvenile sense of fun. Arnold is our towering protagonist, and kills many an underling. Even Bill Duke gets to tangle with him, which obviously doesn't bode well for him. Vernon Wells is an interesting villain, and Rae Dawn Chong is obviously our comic relief. It might have set the record for one-liners, or at least held it for quite some time, right up until Arnold's 90s abomination as Mr. Freeze.",Commando

The rest isn't that in depth, Arnie killing everybody on the face of the planet, lots of jumping about and shooting.

111,Min111,No chance,7,7 March 2021,"The movie - Commando - is older than 'Die Hard' which is probably the greatest action movie ever made. 'Commando' isn't too far behind. Many people discuss the action movies that followed 'Die Hard', but these same people don't discuss about the action movies that came before 'Die Hard', and one of the movies is 'Commando'. Why is that though? I decided to see 'Commando' because Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the movie, and he's one of the most popular action-heroes around. He carries the movie on his own, and that's no disrespect to the rest of the cast. He was the right actor for the main role. If it was anyone else, the movie will have failed. Arnold Schwarzenegger is John Matrix in the movie who's a retired special agent. He has to come out of retirement because a group of bad guys have kidnapped his daughter named Jenny Matrix. He goes out to find and rescue her. The problem is that he has a short amount of time to do so. Will he do the job in rescuing her? John Matrix needs to use all his experience and skills to pull the mission off. 'Commando' is also an adventure and thriller movie, and that's why you'll like the movie to absolute bits. The suspense gets to you. The movie is exciting! Those watching the movie for the first time are in for a treat. There were many good parts to choose from, but I liked the part where John Matrix is at the shopping mall where all kinds of things happens, and one of the security officers is amazed just how large John Matrix really is. John Matrix looks very muscular. I guess John Matrix was too hot to handle. John Matrix was suppose to be on a plane, but he had other ideas, and jumps from the plane just as it is taking off. He meets a woman named Cindy who soon assists him on his mission. This is John Matrix's toughest of assignments. The movie has some memorable one-liners which you'll like. Anyway, another part I liked is where John Matrix fights one of the bad guys named Cooke at the motel. I also liked these car chases which makes for spectacular viewing. The main bad guy is a man named Bennett who knows John Matrix very well. Another one of the characters I liked is John Matrix's superior or the general. The movie would've been more better had we seen more of him. The general appears at the start and end of the movie. Finally, I like how the movie ends. The general wants John Matrix back, but he declines the offer. I was hoping John Matrix would come out of retirement. He still has it in him after seeing the movie. I also liked the soundtrack at the end. The soundtrack is 'We Fight For Love'. The ending looked like it had potential for a sequel, but there was no chance of that happening. 'Commando' must surely be up there as one of the greatest action movies of the eighties. Thankfully, 'Commando' is one of 'many' Arnold Schwarzenegger's action movies we've been blessed with.",Commando

This is a true action cult classic that will be the king of 80's action movies besides ""Die Hard"" and ""Lethal Weapon"", it almost puts Rambo to shame for it's got so many damn memorable quotes such as ""Don't disturb my friend, he's dead tired"" to the infamous ""Let off some steam Bennet!"".

114,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"Action, action, ac-tion in an inane film that commands attention",4,21 November 2012,"1986, the year of revenge movies, saw this Arnie classic, which you could still not get sick of it. We have a strong a back up plot, tonnes of explosions and gunfire, and a couple of standout scenes of violence, amidst. Arnie's forced to do a job he doesn't want to, bring down a good guy, so a bad guy, a corrupt terrorist, (Dan Hedaya-Blood Simple, Running Scared) can replace him and take control, and become president of Val Verde. Only the bad guy has made one hell of a mistake, these sons of you know what, have snatched his teen daughter (a very young Alyssa Milano) and he's none too happy about. The father and daughter scenes in it's early opening montage are great and work against the chaos that's about to ensue. Several of Arnie's old CIA men have been taken down. A leak is involved. It is that of a disguntled party, Bennett (Vernon wells) who used to be one of Arnie's, a crazy fanatic, who wants revenge the way you'd want it, if someone killed your mother. He really wants Arnie to pay, but we all know the resolutions gonna be the other way around. So we have Arnie's objective: to get his daughter back, and mow down whoever gets in his way. Now swallow this, he takes out the bad guy supervising him on the plane. He jumps from a plane many feet, lands in a six foot swamp on the outskirts on the airport, legs still intact. Reality check, please, if the most he would suffer wouldn't be anything, cause he'd be dead. The camera has tricks of manipulating shots. This is one of them. Every time I get on a plane, and it starts taxiing down the runway, I always recall this scene. I just can't help it. Back at the airport, he teams with a sexy black stewardess (Rae Dawn Chong) who helps him get his daughter back. Some quite impactful, suspenseful moments arise in the film, as if any of Hedaya's men spot Arnie (who should still be on the plane) the daughter goes. One such guy is a scuzzy associate of Hedaya's, Sully, who supervised Arnie and company's entrance onto the plane. We know this guy has to die or the daughter will be toast. This Arnie flick has the best one liners, the master one near the end, where Bennett cops it after going berserk on Arnie with a round length of pipe. What was funny and I remember my Mum laughing in this inane film, was when Chong's car slammed into a light pole at fast speed while chasing Sully. Within a second, Arnie asks her, ""Are you alright"" as if she had a contraction while she was pregnant. The body count in Commando is high, surpassing Rambo, not just in number but in terms of violence, these two films, only five months apart in release. The shoot em up ending with Arnie's hulking build in camouflage, never dulls like the whole film. Of course, Arnie lags right behind in the acting stakes, like a few others we know of his ilk. Not enough heart in his words, Some lines he struggles with (as he still does today while working) others line he spouts, signs of a really bad actor. He was better in Raw Deal, if funnier too. I don't know, may'be it was his acting. The way he acts in Commands, there were moments I thought he was on drugs Commando is gratuitous action on a high scale in a classic that will never die. It defies reality with inanity, an inanity wins.",Commando

He places a blanket on the brand new corpse, and his hat over his face, instructs the flight attendant to leave him undisturbed (he's ""dead"" tired), and then manages to leave his seat, feigning illness, find his way to the cargo area, and jump from the craft's underside during take-off, dropping into some (convenient) water, more easily than Greg Louganis diving from his platform.From here mayhem follows mayhem, the fore-mentioned one-liners continue to abound, and Arnold spends the balance of the film storming through every barrier, adversity and bad guy with more force than a brigade of Cossack warriors.It's interesting to read the ""goofs"" section here for this film. If not of record length it is surely close. So many effects were used, guns fired without reloading, Arnold's ammunition supplies multiplied like the Biblical loaves and fishes, the Porche recuperated like the demonic Plymouth in Stephen King's ""Christine,"" and cables and other special effect materials were visible -- while Arnold plodded onward, a testimony to Hollywood's special effects and the potential benefits of Human Growth Hormone.His flicks are nearly always great fun, and this one certainly was.",Commando

This is a nice slice of 80's action with memorable moments despite its misgivings and cheese factor.When members of his former unit are killed off one by one, Matrix is found at his mountain cabin and his daughter is kidnapped. Matrix himself is subdued and told that if he doesn't help a crooked dictator assassinate the new leader of a south american country, his daughter's life will be forfeit. Under the gun and with time ticking away, Matrix escapes their clutches and recruits the help of an airline stewardess. Together, they begin their relentless pursuit of his daughter's captors, killing anybody who gets in the way.This is one of Arnold's best films. There is plenty of over-the-top action, over-the-top acting, and over-the-top carnage to keep even the most critical action fan happy. There are a lot of memorable moments as well - for example when they are in a shopping mall and Matrix swings from a second level balcony across to the other side to land neatly on top of an elevator. The characters are strong and worth following. And the fight scenes are well done as well - there are plenty of bad guys who bite it in this one.I highly recommend ""Commando"". It demands your attention from start to finish, and when it's all done, you wanna just start over and watch it again. In short, Schwarzenegger delivers the goods and is at his physical best.

124,SkullScreamerReturns,"Citizen Kane is better than this, right? WRONG",9,25 December 2019,"Commando is one of the best movies ever. It's an action movie and it doesn't try to hide it. Too many movies are pretentious, trying to be something that they're not. Even action movies can try to be romantic or intelligent or artistic or something non-action. But not Commando.Here we have Arnold Schwarzenegger who does all the things that are needed for a good action movie. He fights with bare hands, fights with knives, goes to a weapon store and grabs a lot of arsenal, looks good in a gearing-up montage, shoots with pistols, rifles, rocket launchers, throws grenades, garden tools, causes a lot of explosions, drives cars, damages cars, tosses bad guys around like they're frisbees, and of course last but not least: he says great one-liners.Extra points for not having: kissing or sex or other romantic subplot, not too much plot anyway, not letting bad guys live so that they could sneak up on him again, not too many side characters (Arnold can handle the situation alone, so just give him a lot of enemies to shoot).There's only one thing that bothers me because it's unrealistic: How does he randomly come across a woman that can fly a plane? And why doesn't he just fly it himself? He's a super soldier who can do everything. Maybe flying a plane is a bit sissy job for him so he needs a lady to do it. He's so super masculine that he only does things that cause instant destruction. Well, besides the plane thing, everything else in this movie makes perfect sense. More movies should be like this.",Commando
125,willcundallreview,An Arnie film that surprised me,7,9 May 2014,"Rating-7/10Commando is a film where when I started to watch, well I didn't expect much from this at all, but to be fair this is not too bad. With big action and a lead man who is so often criticised for his movie actually doing well, this is one movie for those action junkies. Boasting a straight forward but well executed story, the film can go a long way to entertain you in such a short amount of time, I felt that this was just about kind of good, here is why.The story as said is basic, but is manages to be fun at the same time and with some massive explosions and things like car chases this movie just is well, kind of good. The story is at times a bit implausible and by the end the story possibly starts to drag as he kind of does the same thing all the way through it, nevertheless Arnie makes it fun at least. One more thing that I liked about this is that it is fast and doesn't dawdle around for things to happen, it just gets things done well.Arnold Schwarzenegger does job here we so often see, but in this he manages to mix enough action together to ignore his acting skill and by the end you could swear he was good on it. I didn't think this was acted that badly and the characters are really quite fun, I found the villains maybe at times to be well not so evil but to be fair they don't affect the film and very little criticism goes towards the acting part.It isn't written very well and although directed way it really isn't the technical things with this that make it good-ish. The real star with this film is the massive stunts and gun fights which serve to give us some good entertainment, just too harsh to criticise that much. One part done well is with Arnie towards the end where he just lays into enemies left right and centre, the part is done really quite well and in some sense it is thrilling.The main criticism for this is of course is the acting and technical parts because it isn't done so well in that area, although fun and good to watch, if your coming from a rational point of view, you won't like this. Arnie to be fair isn't even at his best in this and he does run the film well but fails to really engage in his role and you feel underwhelmed by his and others performance.Those who like big battles, guns and such will love this as that is just it's basic premise, death. I think Arnie fans should enjoy this and could list this as one of there favourite films of his, it just surprised me how not bad it actually is. Maybe for anyone who doesn't enjoy chock full films of action should stay away as it has little going for it other than that, you wouldn't enjoy this at all.I give this a 7/10 overall, a Just About Kind Of Good movie, nowhere near being Good, but beats being just OK I would say. Watch It like you want to be entertained and you will enjoy yourself, well probably, watch this with your critics hat on and rating it like it's an Oscar pick, you won't enjoy yourself, you have to be easy going to like this film.",Commando
126,Cinemaniac1984,A cult classic that is still enjoyable 30 years later,9,7 February 2015,"Riding high from the success of The Terminator (1984), Arnold Schwarzenegger goes one better in Commando. There is a lot to like about Commando. The plot is very simple, the action is very entertaining, the humour is very tongue in cheek with plenty of one liners that are pure vintage Schwarzenegger, and for its time it was violent. Commando might be the Arnold Schwarzenegger version of Rambo, but there's no denying that Commando is still one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's popular movies 30 years later.John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a former special forces commando who has retired to live a peaceful life with his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). His peaceful life is threatened when General Franklin Kirby (James Olsen) arrives to inform Matrix that other members of his former unit have been murdered by mercenaries and Matrix may be next. After General Kirby leaves, Matrix comes under attack from several mercenaries, kidnapping his daughter and capturing John. The mastermind behind the attack is deposed South American dictator Arius (Dan Hedaya) and a former member of Matrix's unit Bennett (Vernon Wells) who was thrown out of Matrix's unit for acts of brutality and also faked his death in an attempt to bring Matrix out of hiding. John Matrix must complete a political assassination mission by killing the current South American dictator otherwise Jenny will be killed. John Matrix reluctantly agrees but later escapes to find his daughter and stop Arius and Bennett before they kill her. Along the way, John Matrix ropes in a reluctant flight attendant Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) to assist him in his quest to locate his daughter, even if it means starting a one man Army and igniting World War III.John Matrix is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best roles. His undeniable charisma and larger than life presence along with his delivery of his vintage one liners that he is well known for is perfect for Commando. Arnold Schwaezenegger's one liners fit into Commando perfectly such as: ""Don't disturb my friend, he's dead tired."" ""I lied."" and ""Let off some steam, Bennett.""Vernon Wells as Bennett who dresses like Freddy Mercury oozes charm as the mirror foil to Matrix. He has also plenty of one liners such as the conversation he has with Arius' soldier, ""Slitting a girl's throat is like cutting warm butter."" to which Bennett replies, ""Put the knife away, and shut your mouth.""Dan Hedaya who has carved out a diverse career as a character, is great as the overthrown South American dictator Arius who wants to regain his former title.Rae Dawn Chong (Tommy Chong's real life daughter) is very memorable as the reluctant Cindy who is dragged into the thick of the action by John Matrix, but later agrees to help Matrix get his daughter back. She also has plenty of humorous moments throughout the movie. Also appearing in Commando include David Patrick Kelly as the smarmy Sully, Bull Duke as the brutal Cooke, and in a small role Bill Paxton as an intercept officer.I'm normally not a fan of leave-your-brain-at-the-door action movies, however with Commando I am very happy to make an exception. Thankfully the plot is kept simple and the action is still exciting. The climatic showdown when John Matrix wages a one man war against Arius and Bennett is still is still an undeniable classic.Commando is right up there with Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies such as The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Total Recall (1990), True Lies (1994), and Predator (1987). Commando is still a likable and very popular movie after 30 years, and this is vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best.9/10",Commando

130,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,8 February 2005,"Macho, stupid, ultra-violent but nonetheless brilliant, Commando is another perfect example of how to do a classic 80's action flick. Violence? Yes. Explosive? Yes. Simple plot? Yes. Muscle men going at at? Yes. One liners? Yes. Everything is here, and although many hate it, this is still a wildly entertaining film. Back in days of childhood i would watch this and Predator with my friends, and then take our toy guns out and play. These films were important as part of our childhood, and still are today. They may not be suitable for kids, but we knew the difference between right and wrong, and what was real back then. We needed this films to help our imaginations, and even though it is full of flaws, it still should be recognised as pure entertainment. If you enjoy this kind of film that is.Arnie plays John Matrix, ex marine whose daughter is kidnapped by an old colleague, blackmailed into an assassination or his daughter will be killed. However, Matrix soon escapes his man and begins to search for his daughter, with the help of a sceptical trainee pilot played by Rae Dawn Chong. Matrix has revenge on his mind, and no-one will stop him.As always Arnie is perfect, does his lines brilliantly, deals with the action effortlessly. For some reason Chong's performance has been destroyed by critics, but she is pretty good and i can so no flaws. Her character is meant to be annoying and scared, and she plays her that way. Bennett, the main bad guy, famous for his Road Warrior role, is clearly gay-an interesting choice for a macho bad guy, and Alyssa Milano is also good. Bill Duke makes a welcome appearance, as does D.P. Kelly, who has vanished since the Crow. The action and set pieces are excellent, particularly the final attack, the soundtrack works well, and there are hundreds of quotable lines. 'I lied'- Shakespeare never did better. 9 out of 10",Commando
131,Didier-Becu,COMMANDO (DIDIER BECU),6,28 March 2004,"It was clear that Arnie had to have his Rambo rip-off as well as in the eighties movies like that (don't forget Chuck Norris' laughable ""Missing in action"") were succesfull. Don't worry it is your typical Arnie-movie and if you hate his kind of humour you'll be turning off the movie in less than 10 minutes as the tricks showing here are shameless (carrying a tree on one shoulder while going whistling...you bet only he can). The plot of the movie couldn't be more standardish...some bad men (a whole army in fact) want Arnie to kill the president of some imaginary South-American state. To make sure Arnie clears the job they kidnap his daughter (Aliyssia Milano) and that only can be done with the help of tons of guns and the (forced) help from the rather charming Rae Dawn Chong. Some lines in the movie are a bit too much of a rip-off (from a general in some helicopter who tries to convince Arnie not to do it, where have we heard that before?) till the line ""I'll be back"" but in general this is brainless entertainment that is dated but still kind of funny.",Commando
132,DavidYZ,Brilliant action film with loads of humour,10,14 April 2017,This is my favourite action film and I can't find any faults in it. It has great chases and shoot-outs. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his best performance.It has lots of very funny lines and scenes - more humour than I've seen in any other action film.,Commando
133,mOVIemAN56,A bad plot makes a great comedy... with some violence on the side,5,30 July 2007,"Commando will have you on the floor laughing. I don't know what it is about this movie that makes me laugh so hard every time I see it. Is it the extra super human strength they give Arnold through out the movie? Is it the crazy ability for Arnold to kill an entire army while he remains unharmed? Or is it just the fact that Arnold, throughout the movie keeps asking ""Chenny?"" (his daughters name in the movie is Jenny). I don't know what it is about Commando but I have never enjoyed such a pointless, comical action flick so much.The story revolves around retired Col. John Matrix who's daughter has been kidnapped by a warlord. Arius (the warlord) demands Matrix assassinates the president of the warlords homeland. If he does that, he'll get his daughter back. Along with Arius is the sinister Bennett, a former member of Matrix's unit. Instead of Matrix going on the flight he escapes and begins to track down his daughter with the help of a stewardess. What follows is what I have come to describe as violently hilarious.There is just something about Arnold Schwarzenegger that makes him funny even when he isn't meant to be. In the film Arnold is given even more strength then he is capable off such as being able to hold a man by the foot with one arm over a cliff while standing up or being able to flip a car over. Arnold has his hilarious lines and some scenes have gone down in history as just classic such as the demise of Sully when Arnold drops him off a cliff. Arnold gets loads of actions, wielding any weapon imaginable from a rocket launcher to a pitch fork. He has them all and he kills with them all.The action is the highlight of the film. It's pretty much senseless. Arnold walks around just killing at random. I personally believe Commando was a rough draft for Terminator. The fights are pretty cool though. Even though it makes very little sense why Matrix is running around beating the crap out of anyone he can find I still found it hard to not watch. It's the case of a movie being so bad it's good. It makes you laugh when your not suppose to but there is nothing wrong with that. Most action films featuring Arnold have that effect on people.Pretty much the movie is a train wreck. A bad plot mixed with bad acting and superb violent sequences. Mix that all together and add Arnold as the main character and a strange, Australian guy who seems to have a fetish for knife fights and you get Commando. Commando works as a decent action film and as a great comedy. Most of the violence is off the wall, unnecessary, and hilarious. You will enjoy Commando though you'll probably be wondering how Arnold can kill so many in such little time.2.5/5 stars",Commando
134,OttoVonB,"If you like cheese, this is the movie equivalent of a fondue",6,27 February 2012,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is the embodiment of 80s-90s muscle-man action cinema, an era we can now look back on with nostalgia, mostly for its unabashed mixture of macho ultra violence and out-of-control kitsch. It's interesting to note that the Austrian Titan's first great commercial disappointment - Last Action Hero - was a parody of the genre he dominated. How do you parody parody itself? The man's best films, the first two Terminator films and Predator, rise above that, but most of his work is inches from being one big spoof.While you can't parody the genre outright, you can take it to its extreme, and I'm not sure what Commando is or who it was meant for, but that's what it does. Schwarzenegger's John Matrix (a typical Austrian name, that) lives a life of mono parental bliss with daughter Jennie (or, as he calls Alyssa Milano, ""Tchainee"") until she is kidnapped and he is forced to throw all his retired killing machine skills into saving her.We can run through the ingredients, it's actually worth it for once: - Body fascination. The film never hesitates to glory on Schwarzenegger's body, and while he isn't showing off with impossible feats (carrying a tree or busy phone booth) he just sits there, bare-chested, for the camera. - Homo-erotic subtext. If it's that in-your-face, it can't really be subtext. Beside the fact that this is probably an affront to gays everywhere, the tension between Ahnuld and main villain Bennett would be interesting if it weren't for... well... Bennett himself. I'd describe the world's most ill-conceived blockbuster villain for you, but I'd rather not ruin the surprise. Just youtube ""Last Fight Scene - Matrix vs Bennett"". - Gratuitous violence. Not much blood here, but every bullet that grazes the floor creates its own explosion. And the stunt-work reaches miraculous levels of retardation. - ""Clever"" One-liners. If that's your thing, you're in for a real treat. - Outrageous music: oh boy, you can't imagine... - Sexy but severely underused damsel in distress. Underused? We wish. Sexy, not quite. It's hard to even rate this film. It makes for a delirious group viewing experience, but then again, nobody could ever honestly call it a good a film. And unlike True Lies, another very silly film, this hasn't aged gracefully at all, hence much of its ""charm"" is down to nostalgia. It's the only way to forgive the film's confounding technical ineptitude (the number of goofs and continuity disasters sets a record).You have to see it to believe it. Then again, maybe not. Just check out the wildest bits and watch Predator instead.Thank you YouTube!",Commando

136,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest Action Films Of Ever Made. An Excellent,Thrilling And Explosive Action Classic. Arnold Schwarzenegger At His Best.",10,21 November 2014,"Commando is one of the greatest Action films of ever made,an excellent,thrilling and explosive Action classic that is filled with great direction,a brilliant performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger,amazing Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Commando one of the finest Action films of the 1980s that is Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best.Commando tells the story of John Matrix(Arnold Schwarzenegger),a retired Army Colonial who is living a quiet life with his daughter Jenny(Alyssa Milano). But John's life is interrupted when South American criminals kidnap his daughter and hold her captive. Now,John must step back into Action and wage a one man war against his daughter's captures which will lead to explosive results.Commando is a brilliant,Action-packed and explosive classic in the Action genre and is a film that not only was a Box Office hit in 1985 but also a Cult Classic and is one of the films that truly helped define Action movies in the 1980s but is also one of the all-time great Action movies that helped make Arnold Schwarzenegger a movie star and icon and is an incredible movie that just simply breathes entertainment and thrills. Right from the very beginning to it's exciting end Commando is an amazing Action film and one of the best One Man Army films ever made(it's up there with Die Hard)that is Action-filled and thrilling,intense and exciting as well as humorous and over the top giving viewers a movie that is truly the definition of a great Popcorn Movie because it's not the kind of movie that's going to win Academy Awards with a thought-provoking storyline and it's not a movie that going to make viewers think but is just a simple Action movie that wants viewers to do one thing and and one thing only and that is to have a good time watching the movie and Commando works in delivering a good time and never stops. The Action in Commando is amazing,intense and memorable because this movie has everything that will satisfy Action lovers:gunfights,hand to hand combat,explosions with various weapons used and a high body count. The Action throughout Commando is done in an incredible style that was very common in the 1980s and is non-stop from start to finish. I think the only other Action classic and One Man Army film that can match Commando's Action and high body count is Rambo:First Blood Part II(which was also released in 1985). What also makes Commando a great movie and a true Action classic is the film's Humor which is hilarious and over the top mainly because of the one-liners and dialog by John Matrix which is done with puns and ironic style. The Humor is also hilarious because of the situations that happen in throughout the film which are tongue in cheek,funny and give Commando a terrific tone that is just outrageous. The Humor and one-liners would become a trademark in some of Schwarzenegger's later films with Commando setting the table. The main character John Matrix is just terrific,memorable and is the true definition of an Action Hero and One Man Army because he is large,in charge and can kick a person's butt using his old military skills,brains,various weapons or his fists and when you see John Matrix you feel like he will not lose the fight no matter what whether he's going up against one man or a group. Also,we as the viewer get a brief glimpse into his family life and the relationship with his daughter Jenny and how John loves her which makes his mission to get her back more powerful and gripping. John Matrix is one of the best Action characters of the 1980s and you will love the character while you watch the film. The ending of Commando(the final 20-30 minutes)is one of the best endings ever captured in an Action film with tons of intense Action and excitement that will have viewers cheering and clapping at the screen. A great ending.The cast is wonderful. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent and at his best as John Matrix,with Schwarzenegger being charismatic and likable. Rae Dawn Chong is terrific as Cindy,a flight attendant that helps John. Dan Hedaya is great as Arius,a South American dictator. Vernon Wells is fantastic and menacing as Bennett,a rival of John's. Alyssa Milano is wonderful as Jenny Matrix,John's Daughter. James Olson is memorable as Major General Franklin Kruby,John's former Commander. David Patrick Kelly(Sully)and Bill Duke(Cooke)are amazing in their small roles as sleazy bad guys. Also,lookout for a cameo by Bill Paxton as an Interceptor.The direction by Mark L. Lester is great,with Lester always moving the camera and bringing a simple but effective style to the film while doing an outstanding job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,Lester.The score by James Horner is amazing,intense and matches the Action and tone of the movie. Great score,Horner. There is also an incredible song called We Fight For Love by Power Station that plays at the end.In final word,if you love Arnold Schwarzenegger or Action Films,I highly suggest you see Commando,one of the greatest Action films ever made and an excellent,thrilling and explosive Action classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Commando
137,TheHonestCritic,This is the best Arnold Schwarzenegger film.,10,3 October 2019,"""Commando"" (1985), this is another example of a perfect action film. It is by far the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, and it gives you everything he has to offer and then some! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack. The story may sound like the everyday kidnap and rescue story, but trust me, this movie takes that concept and turns it up to 11. I don't mind seeing recycled plot lines in movies, just as long as the writers add something new to the idea and it's told in a clever way. This movie definitely accomplishes that in it's story. Add action and brilliant one-liners, then you have a perfect exciting movie! The acting is great from the whole entire cast, Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my favorite action stars. As for the rest of the main cast and side characters, they perform their roles flawlessly. The sets/locations are well put together and give the movie a great atmosphere. The special effects are well done and hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack is great and it really ties the movie together. James Horner really gave a unique film score to this movie. It is really reflective to the time period, and it's the cherry on top for this brilliant movie! Had someone else wrote the music, it may not have worked. James Horner really brought this film to life with his music score for the movie! ""Commando"" is a phenomenal achievement, and has launched a new kind of genre into the action films that we know today. This movie is such a lot of fun to watch, and extremely entertaining. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking to get into Arnold Schwarzenegger films for the first time and don't know where to begin, start with ""Commando"". It was the first Arnold Schwarzenegger film I ever saw and it gets you into what Arnold really has to offer action movie fans. I guarantee you'll love this movie.

AT BEST PEOPLE!However, every time I see this movie I call back to six years old when I couldn't sleep, and I was given a small TV so archaic you needed a screwdriver to work it. Late at night, this box introduced me to so many ""classics"" and one of them was ""Commando"". From then on, the movie has never left my side since. Years later, the closest of my friends who also saw the movie laugh hysterically whilst viewing it. Now 22 and still introducing people to this gem (Most notably film students of the same age), I'm still in tears of laughter at how much I love everything about this movie. So much so, it continues to stand proudly in my Blu-Ray collection.Slap-bang in the middle of Schwarzenegger's career. ""Commando"" features ""performances"" by the likes of Alyssa Milano, Bill Paxton and a tour-de-force performance from Vernon Wells as over the top villain Bennett (Chigurh eat your heart out). James Horner's score is indescribable action cheese, and the marketing features one of the best trailers ever made (YouTube it). What else can I say? nothing good at all. It's a one man army movie for the ages, as bullets fly and windows shatter. Dialogue is entirely made up of one liners, albeit none making sense considering they get great comic book scribe Jeph Loeb to write it.Final Verdict: As you have read, none of this should be taken seriously. It's pure fun at its best and worst, utter worst. But I promise you in a video game generation, THIS IS MANDATORY VIEWING! They literally made a movie of cliché's. 8/10.",Commando

140,CelluloidRehab,Commando. Kirby. Code Red. Coordinates. Got it.,8,7 June 2007,"I used to have a VHS copy of this movie that I watched so much, that I wore out the tracking. This is only the second movie (the first being the Terminator), I had ever seen, in which the Austrian sensation did not yield a sword, wear a furry loin cloth or ride a horse. This has the quintessential formula for a Schwarzenegger action movie. Key elements of this formula would include non-stop action, gun play, one-liners delivered with accented stoicism, the muscles and a body count numbering in the hundreds.In Last Action Hero (an often misunderstood and underrated Schwarzenegger parody action movie with comic elements), Jack Slater (Arnold) and Danny (his pint-size partner from the real world) are in a video store. We are shown an alternate universe where Sylvester Stallone is the star of Terminator 2 : Judgment Day. In that same universe, this movie could well be looked upon as Schwarzenegger interpreting John Rambo.John Matrix (Schwarzenegger) is a single dad and retired ultra-elite commando living incognito with his daughter, Alyssa Milano. A prepubescent Alyssa Milano, on top of that. I can't make this stuff up. Other members of his elite unit are being systematically eliminated in a convoluted ploy to reveal Matrix's location and kidnap his daughter. Her kidnapping would be used as leverage to force Matrix to perform a presidential assassination. Instead, Matrix uses his commando skills in detecting her location and executing a rescue. His skill set would include : commando driving, commando killing, commando shooting, commando hand-to-hand combat, commando jumping, commando sneaking, commando super senses, commando acting and commando shopping.The plot isn't very convoluted and reveals itself to be quite straightforward. The non-stop, over-the-top action, sheer personality and pronunciation of Schwarzenegger is what keeps this movie entertaining. That and the sheer body count. I counted 89, but that is a conservative estimate. 85 of those occurred in the last 20 minutes of the movie. The supporting cast is atrociously bad and does nothing to help him. This is a one-man-show. Dam Hedaya's presidentially Latin accented English, Alyssa Milano's best Tammy Faye Baker impersonation and the pathetically whinny (and psychotic) nemesis of Bennett (Vernon Wells) do little except show off the smoked Gouda inherent in the movie. Wells is much better as the crazy, silent type (see the Road Warrior and Innerspace) than the talkative psychotic. Even pre-Boca Rae Dawn Chong barely manages to steal any of the spotlight from the Governator. I have enjoyed this movie from my youth and it has not lost any of its 80's charm (steel drum soundtrack included). It is impossible to take this movie seriously, so don't. In the real world, the movie would have ended when Matrix jumped out of a jet airline into a 3 foot deep marsh or during the Mall mêlée or while single handedly taking out a small and well armed militia (and dishing the catchy one-liners). So kick back, have a drink (or several) and let off some steam. This is one is sure to not let go.",Commando
141,jldmp1,Hasty Pudding,5,1 December 2006,"This was Arnold's first movie specifically designed to feature him. Accordingly, the writers were commissioned to assemble something that gave the fans exactly what they wanted: ""Terminator"" one-liners, ""Terminator"" editing (the car chase in this movie is identical to its predecessor)...and, basically, ""The Terminator"" as the good guy, blowing away low-rent Latin American mercenaries and dictators.And what that movie promised in terms of the juxtaposition of a body builder laughing at his own image, this delivered. The joke, of course, is Arnold deadpanning his way through Chong's comic relief. So it serves its purpose as a guilty pleasure, but it accomplishes no more than that.This was made back in the days before enormous theater multiplexes, so the business paradigm was different. Studios had to consider how many times per day a film could be projected in the same room, and cut running times as needed.And it shows here...the opening title sequence squeezes all of the sentiment into shorthand form; no extraneous emotions appear at any point after that - we're whisked into a world of cartoon heroes and villains. Lines are delivered as quickly as possible. Reaction shots are barely registered.At least Arnie was more fun to hang out with than Chuck or Sly.",Commando

The music score the actors, puppetry and so on.I used to be the biggest fan of Schwarzenegger of all time, because his movie were damn good. What Schwarzenegger is doing with his career is a damn disgrace. I love Arnold's old films from the 80's when his career started I still can't believe that Schwarzenegger praise Terminator 2: Judgment Day that it is his best film, but Commando doesn't. I would definitely say Commando is his best film. I know in the 80's Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were competitive because the same year Rambo: First Blood Part II come out and it was worldwide success it made more money than ""Commando"" and Rambo won an Oscar. Commando come out the same year and when Schwarzenegger learn about Rambo: First Blood Part II he was extremely mad that time on Stallone and because Commando wasn't such a box office hit like Rambo: First Blood Part II was.If I would had to chose an action film with one men army Commando or Rambo: First Blood Part II you already know which one would I chose and that would be Rambo: First Blood Part II cause I am a huge Rambo fan.Arnold blasts bad guys to pieces, he beats all the bad security guys in the mall, slides with the rope like Tarzan, throws phone booth like for joke. Dresses with guns and he arms himself like an army and sneaks into Arias' fortress. That scene was a bad-ass, as a commando he shoots with machine guns M60 army of soldiers, blows up barracks with Claymore and detonator, fights with Bennett (Vernon Wells) and rescue his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). Matrix uses 4-barreled rocket launcher and blows up the wall bad-ass. Matrix kills all the soldiers, the film is also a little slasher in which Matrix uses knives, working tool, axe and machete like Jason Voorhees in which he cut's a soldiers arm off really brutal.John Matrix was also my favorite action hero in my childhood and he was a comic book hero too me and guess what? He still is, his right there between John Rambo and Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti.Chelsea Field is also in the movie as one of the flight attendants she was in action movies like The Last Boy Scout, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man and Masters of the Universe she was in the action movies like this. I would definitely replace Rae Dawn Chong with Chelsea Field and put her as Matrix side kick.Great music score form James Horner who is no longer with us anymore R.I.P. Brilliant story, with action and great cast simply bad-ass one men army action film from the 80's. Every year I am watching this movie on Blu-ray with my dad I also do have a DVD home about this movie. Why can't Hollywood make action movies like this one today? The score is 10.",Commando

John Matrix is a former Special Forces colonel whose daughter is kidnapped by criminals who want to force him to commit political assassination. Of course, this is not going to go the way they envision, as the John Matrix moves into rescue and revenge. The film is full of brutal action, explosions, violence is bloody and explicit, just the way it should be. The film is entertaining, as are the characters who are hilarious, but in a good way.

During the height of the Schwarzenegger/Stallone rivalry, Arnold made Commando, an in your face assault on Rambo. Who is more rip, bigger guns, (both arms and weapons) over the top action, and pure muscle pushes each actor to out do the other, which results in the making of Commando, which is so bad it's good. Cheesy story, with non awarding winning acting is mixed with insane action, muscles, and Dark Humor makes Commando fun to watch.

You may have heard the phrase ""Leave your brain at the door?""  Well for this one, you'll have to leave it at the South Pole.  The plot is so utterly implausible (and at times completely impossible) that anyone with an IQ over 50 will have difficulty ""getting into"" this -- we're constantly reminded that we're seeing Arnold playing Arnold in a movie.  And Rae Dawn Chong is one of the worst actors I've ever seen (maybe she's improved since then, I haven't seen her much).If you're an Arnie fan, it's worth seeing once to see some of his earlier work.

The end fight is a little disappointing (ending too quickly), but getting there is a lot of fun.

147,AndreiPavlov,Get Matrixed,7,14 August 2006,"Saw this piece of nonsense once but, unfortunately, inattentively. But from my first viewing of this nonsensical movie the following was remembered: John Matrix with an axe, looking into its mirroring blade and seeing his daughter joyfully running to him from behind (that scene made me uneasy - was he going to give her an axe?), the same man brawling with the policemen (he looked so much like King-Kong), again the same John Matrix running and walking aloof with some unspeakable arsenal through the picturesque garden with beautiful rose-bushes, flowers, antique statuettes, etc. and firing in all directions...Then quite a lot of time passed (more than a decade) and there was this crazy info about this flick on IMDb. Recollecting a few things, it really made my day - shaking with suppressed laughter was guaranteed (was reading it in the office). The DVD had to be purchased.Yes, certain credit should be done to the supporting actors (to the actress who played Cindy - definitely: in one scene she was going to puke but instead of throwing up she happened to get absolutely calm in a second). Entertainment at its best. It seems that all the men and women who had some relation to the project just caught up the right tune. Superb mass mess of a movie! Better than anything else in the wide field of goofy action. Laughing each time when recall the face of Vernon (""buffed-up Freddie"", as one viewer put it).By the way, the evil dude from ""Highlander"" also resembled Freddie and that resemblance delighted me all right, but ""Highlander"" was not this funny.One more remark to point out. This movie is a phenomenon in entertaining industry. It has an absolutely hilarious (at least to me) rewatchability potential. Still, they should have made a few versions of this movie with different endings and shootout scenes in order to completely satisfy anyone on the planet (old ladies, young moms and infants included).7 out of 10 (minus 3 point because the movie is too short and the number of KIA villains is too small - there should have been thousands, and also because those clever dudes excluded the scene where Matrix was to hit one of the villains with the cut-off arm), Hollywood unconsciously created a masterpiece that must score at least 8.0 on IMDb.

One-liners, totally useless goons, a hero that can seemingly never be touched and has his ego stroked for the whole film by people who used to know him, it's all here in spades.And it's one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had watching a film this entire year so far. Make no mistake though, this film is kind of...rubbish, but by god does it know that and run with it. Everything about it is cheese distilled into its purest form - the acting, the editing, the story, and especially the dialogue.But I couldn't possibly believe any of it is unintentional. Were I to believe that, I would have to believe that everyone ever involved in making this film has two brain cells that are all fighting for third place, and...I'll give them the benefit of a doubt.And even though it is basically pure cheese, there is something oddly compelling about it. Maybe it's how they were smart enough to give it a ticking clock element so that the plot is always moving along, or maybe it's how it managed to genuinely surprise me in terms of where the plot goes a few times.Whatever it was, damn it was a blast, so please give it a shot and let your mind be turned to mush for an hour and a half.",Commando
149,illbebackreviews,One of Arnold's better films but please....That doesn't mean it is one of the greatest films ever made!!!,8,12 June 2013,"Reading the top reviews, I cannot quite understand what moron would honestly consider Commando to be the greatest film ever made. Well, one of these IMDb users is a complete moron to say that Commando is by far, the greatest film ever made. That being said, Commando is a movie that is Arnold back in his glory days and is simply, a ton of fun.Commando tells the story of Arnold Schwarzenegger who plays a retired Black Ops soldier named John Matrix who goes on a killing spree in desperate search for his lost daughter, who was kidnapped by a group of terrorists as a means to get John Matrix. Matrix finds no way other than to kill everyone as a means to get his daughter back and begins to do just that! The story is simple, effective and a ton of fun. However, the best parts of the story aren't the action but simply, the character moments especially those between Jenny and John. Whilst this is rather clichéd stuff, it surprisingly works well in this film with Arnold giving a good enough performance for us to buy him as a fatherly figure. His friendship and how it builds between Cindy, a flight attendant off work is also done rather well, giving us a somewhat realistic take early on. Her character proves rather likable, playing the typical damsel in distress more than Jenny! The action sequences are extremely low budgeted and come off looking extremely cheap, especially a sequence involving an explosion in a town. The effects looked absolutely horrendous but at the same time, makes for part of the fun. Arnold and his classic delivery of some of the cheesiest lines ever was just plain awesome. ""Can you do me a favor? Please don't disturb my friend. He's ""dead"" tired!"" The writing was actually rather good, surely providing some of the cheesiest lines but at the same time, being aware of what kind a film this truly is. I really loved Commando for one reason...well two reasons! Arnold and the film's unapologetic message of ruthless badassery! Commando is a film that is definitely worth a check but it most definitely isn't a film anywhere near the style and brilliance of some of his other films, especially Terminator and Terminator 2.",Commando
150,jerekra,Great Action Flick.,9,21 May 2009,"Commando is a film that has great action in it. It is highly entertaining as well and a film that I really enjoyed.John Matrix, a retired military soldier, has the most important thing in his life, his daughter, kidnapped. He is ordered to kill a leader of a country in order to get her back but instead he decides to go after the ones responsible for kidnapping his daughter.The plot in this film is simple and not complicated. Matrix must save his daughter by using his military tactics. Easy to follow and understand.Schwarzenneggar is great as usual. Great in the action scenes and also really plays a great former military guy, he really looks and acts like a military soldier. Also he has some of the best one liners you will ever hear in a film ever.The action is really well done in this film. I do not want to give too much away but this is a great action flick. IF you like action, then you will most probably like this film.I also liked the villain of Bennett in this film. It is interesting how he was dismissed by Matrix and comes back to get revenge on Matrix for free, when he could have been paid a lot. Great villain that fits in this film.Also I like how there is female presence that is important. However she does not make the film romantic at all and the film is able to stay strictly an action flick. That is good because this should only be an action flick.There are a lot of extremely cheesy parts, but this is a fun film so I think that helps. Mainly scenes where Arnold is super strong and able to dodge bullets with ease. I think that cheesy parts help to make some action films even better and that is the case here.SO this is a great action flick, one of the better ones from the eighties. Arnold rules, and so does this film. Highly recommended.",Commando
151,TheHande,Wasted potential,4,11 December 2007,"Commando is by far the most depressingly lazy action movie I've ever seen. Though Arnold Schwarzenegger has an image as a hard-core action star it is not a reputation that is built on his tough-guy image, but on his likability beyond his tough-guy image. His character in this movie, however, is anything but likable. Though blessed with a simple concept where the film fails is essentially to make anything significant out of it. The characters are also the most two dimensional I've ever seen.The film feels like such a terrible waste since from a production point of view there's really nothing wrong with it. The cinematography is nice and crisp, the action scenes are competent and the soundtrack is wonderfully 80s in style. What the film severely lacks is content. The characters don't say anything meaningful beyond the first scenes with John and Jenny after which the film turns into a violent series of over the top action. The problem here is that the action is neither memorable or amusing.When the film finally reaches the climax between the two old Commandos you've already been bored to death by the redundantly high body count. This film may be an action-fans wet dream but it is the nightmare of any sensible movie-goer. The only thing worth seeing in this film is the obscene amount of killing that occurs throughout the film.",Commando

Character development might be nil, but such a small price to pay for such action.",Commando
153,monkeysgalore,"Toxic Masculinity, Stewed to Perfection",10,9 February 2020,"Is there an action movie out there as overblown, gloriously OTT, self-aware, and insanely fun as Arnold Schwarzenegger's action epic ""Commando""? It may not be his opus, and it doesn't deal with complex themes like Total Recall (1990) or the ""Terminator"" films, but it's just spectacular to watch. It's a cinematic masterwork, just serious enough to be entertaining and not cringey, and just self-deprecating enough to be really amusing. You can't call yourself an action fan if you haven't seen it.Arnold Schwarzenegger is probably the biggest name in action movies. Sylvester Stallone is probably as big, but Arnold has made mostly consistently good movies throughout his career, and while Sly's career seems to be on the decline, Arnold's still doing his thing. He's the face of action movies. I mean, he's the star of what's widely considered to be one of the best, if not the actual best, action movies of all time, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). He's just iconic. And immensely likable. I believe that his likability stems from the fact that he was always able to make fun of himself. Unlike Sly, he always wanted to do comedy, and he was making fun of himself since the beginning, and never has any of films (with the possible exception of Last Action Hero (1993)), been more self-deprecating than this film.This movie is just TOO over-the-top to be taken seriously. One can't not notice the subtle jokes and digs. It may not look like it, but Arnold is laughing at himself the whole time. The one-liners, the crazy kills, the OTT action scenes, his impenetrability, it's all there. It's immensely entertaining. While it borders on self-parody, it also relies on what of the most simplistic, and effective action formulas out there today: the ""trained killer rescuing a young girl from bad guys"" formula. Yes, before Taken (2008), and even Man on Fire (2004), Arnold was there, revolutionizing what would become a widely imitated formula. ""Commando"" is the OG ""Taken"".Anyway, the action is just insane here. Michael Bay would be proud, and I'll bet much of his inspiration comes from this film, as one can't help but notice shades of ""Commando"" and Arnold's other films in Bay's work. This movie is basically one long action sequence. The cabin raid, the hummer chase/fight, the mall fight, the car chase, the motel fight, the plane scene, the mansion shootout, and the final fight are all so memorable and entertaining, and Arnold just looks so good and at home during it all. The set-pieces are excellent and memorable, and thoroughly violent (a guy get's scalped, a guy gets his arm chopped off, etc.), and not for the faint of heart.This movie is so trashy and fun, it's impossible to not enjoy. It's basically ""Action Movie: The Movie"". This is where all the genre tropes originated (well, most), and this is the true birthplace of what the liberals call ""toxic masculinity"".",Commando
154,Ziya90,"A nightmare for the haters, a joy for the fans!",7,12 December 2009,"You know that almost all of the ""intellectual"" critics hate Schwarzenegger and according to them, Arnie is an untalented muscle mass who makes cheesy and terrible action movies and Commando is one of them. Schwarzenegger is not Daniel Day Lewis or Sean Penn for sure, but he has a pulling power and he is a great action movie star, also he has some masterpieces like The Predator, Total Recall or The first two Terminator movies. By the way, I think that his performance in The Terminator 2 was perfect. Commando is a cult classic, a mouth watering action film for the fans and yes, if you think simply, it is perfect. The action scenes, especially in the very climactic final part are awesome! Commando sometimes looks crude and maybe too brutal for the squeamish, but it is very stylish and almost perfectly done if you can ignore some shooting mistakes. By the way, it is a big question mark that critics who adore B movies and cheap movies bash Commando. People say that Schwarzenegger slaughters more people than he does in Terminator movies which is disgusting! Firstly, violence in Schwarzenegger (also including some other action stars such as Van Damme, Stallone, Seagal etc.) movies are not sick or sadistic like recent action or horror movies called violence porn. No torture, No screams, No cannibalism, no sadism and no extreme situations or actions here. This is an action packed. The very long last part would satisfy every action fan in this universe. Schwarzenegger prepares like Rambo and becomes a single army! There is only one point that bothered me. It is he should not fight in front of his little girl.

Rather they make the most of Arnold's talent for action roles.I thoroughly enjoyed the film. There's no character development (none needed), no extensive back story, and no thought content to get in the way. When you initially see Arnold carrying a telephone pole on his shoulder, you have an indication of how close to reality this film will be, and you don't need to know anything else.Dan Hedaya plays a villain without any nuance, and with a bizarre accent that sounds unidentifiably foreign. But for a film like this, you don't ask questions. Dan's character may be one-dimensional, but he plays that single dimension for all it's worth.Vernon Wells, an excellent Aussie actor, plays another villain, in what I think was the most remarkable acting in the film. When I watched the film, I got the feeling that Vernon was playing Bennett (the villain) as a closet case. Not extreme, but it made me wonder. And then, today I read a bit of an interview with Vernon, in which he said that his concept of Bennett was ""Freddie Mercury on steroids."" Exactly correct-that's exactly how he played the role, and I thought it was terrific.",Commando
157,kingofdanerds,Great introduction film for those who are not familiar with Schawarzenegger,8,22 July 2021,"One of the biggest action films to come out of 1985 was Rambo: First Blood Part II (really fun action flick which I recommend). A film that is often compared to it is Commando which was released literally the same year. The film was directed by Mark L. Lester and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger. Despite not making as much money as Rambo: First Blood Part II, the film still did well financially and was a critical success.Former Marine, John Matrix, lives alone with his daughter. When some terrorists capture his daughter, he has to go and save her.This is what I call a film that would be a great introductory film to Arnold Schwarzenegger It is simple and has everything usually present in his films. It is films like The Terminator, Terminator 2, and Total Recall that give more and set a pretty high bar. With that being said, this is a film that I can easily compare to Rambo: First Blood Part II. Both involve a big muscular, machine gun toting man who blows his way through everyone and everything coming out seemingly unharmed. Sure, the action scenes in Rambo are bigger and more epic but I prefer Schwarzengger in this role in this film than Stallone in Rambo: First Blood Part II. Commando is what would be deemed a dumb action film but that is fine. It is pure fun. Fun gunfights, awesome one liners from Arnold, great effects and a kickass score from James Horner of whom I have been a fan of. The acting is nothing special and even the main antagonist is kind of forgettable.Commando is a film that is a good way to spend an afternoon watching. It is fun and has everything that one could ask for in a Schwarzenegger film.",Commando
158,JaydoDre,Campy but entertaining,6,3 May 2016,"Just to clarify from the start: Commando is not a good movie by general standards. But it is a cultural and style icon for those who care.The story is simple and cliché for most part but it is well executed and has two really surprising turns that subvert the common action clichés of the day. The fact that the rest of the story is so simple and standard just makes those two plot points stand out more.The dialogue is pure 80s cheese. There are constant bursts of awkward exposition and explanation, chewing everything for the audience, and of course the silly one-liners.The acting is pretty bad, with characters either overacting or underacting, but thankfully the overacting prevails, which places this film into the so-bad-that-it's-good territory. Arnold is campy but charismatic as always. The female supporting character is not useless and has been well incorporated into the story, but she could have been any guy. There is a sense that the only reason she is a female is because the law of action movies stipulates that the hero needs a romantic interest, even when nothing romantic takes place. The surprise of the film is Vernon Wells, as one of the villains. He overacts like everyone else, but every now and then his reactions are actually subtle and realistic.The costumes are ridiculous. The action is over the top, with no regard for even the basic logic or laws of physics. The soundtrack is stylish and fits well, but it is also some of the purest cheap- sounding synth of the 80s. It is unbelievable that a composer like Horner was responsible for it. There is a tension tune that consists of just the same keyboard key being pressed repeatedly over and over. Yet, for all its flaws, the film is a coherent composition that is aware of its nature and quality. And the value of this film does not wholly lie in laughing at its unintentional camp. The camera work is alright, the aforementioned plot twists are interesting and the music has its moments. There is just enough quality in this film mixed with the 80's style to keep it from being bad.Of course, if you for some reason do not yet know Commando and you want to actually see a good action movie, do not watch this.

In Arnold's career bio, it is by no means his best work, but it definitely gives a run for his most entertaining. It's one of those movies that you could put on a ""so bad it's good"" list. It's got some real cheesy moments, technical goofs, a lot of memorable moments and supporting characters. Its funny even when it's not trying to be and its topped to the brim with gonzo action scenes that only the 80's could have brought us.With a fast paced script that never gets bogged down and loaded with one-liners left and right, Commando almost seems tailor made. It should be illegal for it to be this much fun! The whole thing never lets up. From the intro credit sequence that borders on sappy but hilarious to the kill everybody end shootout. Commando is classic action, classic 80's, classic Schwarzenegger. The director and some of the cast are no strangers to B movies and naturally the plot is strictly by-the-numbers, but everything works so flawlessly it's almost a crime. The only question to ask is was Commando supposed to come off so goddamn funny or were we to take this stuff seriously? All in good fun either way I suppose, but imagining it being the latter makes it all the funnier.All that said, the real star of the movie is Vernon Wells. Arnold is in form, Arnold is Arnold after all, but Vernon as the villain, Bennett, nearly steals the whole show lock, stock and barrel. He's so over-the-top it's like a rocket to the moon. Stalking around in a chain-mail vest of all things, he's shades of a typical b movie villain, but can't be taken seriously at all. He's not physically imposing next to Arnold's physique at all, yet he's so alive on the screen and so f'ing hilarious! His accent on top of it all? Gold. Arnold gets more than his share of moments, lines, but the creme de creme might be reserved for when he tangos with Bennett. Listening to them spout off macho banter in the finale is almost orgasmic.

163,shaun98,Classic Arnold,6,22 February 2004,"Plot -- Arnold Schwarzenegger plays John Matrix, a retired colonel who is forced to go back into action when his daughter is kidnapped by terrorists, led by a brutal exiled dictator.Critique -- ""Commando"" is one of these movies that define the action genre in the eighties--big, loud and dumb, but at least it has the good sense not to take itself seriously. The storyline is absolutely absurd, especially the outcome. But Arnie is clearly aware of how silly the material is, so he just enjoys the ride and enlivens everything with his self-depreciating humor. Though he's a man of action who disposes of dozens of faceless goons, he wholeheartedly delivers his trademark one-liners (such as ""I eat Green Berets for breakfast. And right now I'm very hungry""). The film officially reaches levels of high camp with the ultraviolent ending, as he raids the enemy stronghold and mows down baddies with his potent arsenal. It's goofy, but undeniably diverting. Unlike Stallone's ""Rambo"" films, there's no attempt at social comment; ""Commando"" never pretends to be anything other than a display of mindless violence, and that's all we need from Arnold. Running at a brisk ninety minutes, it moves along in an efficient, straightforward manner, without getting burdened with needless subplots. The supporting cast (Rae Dawn Chong as the female sidekick, Vernon Wells and Dan Hedaya as baddies) are adequate, but in the end, all that matters is that this is Arnie's show.

When Schwarzeneggar's beloved daughter is kidnapped by a psychotic dictator, he doesn't try to reason with the bad guys or take precautions like most action heroes would. He just goes bonkers and starts killing everyone in sight. The movie is packed with fantastic scenes such as Arnie crashing a car at about 80 mph, without a seatbelt, and being perfectly fine, Arnie tearing a phone booth out of a wall, Arnie punching a guy through a wall, etc. It's gloriously entertaining.Also, despite his reputation for bad acting, he delivers all his lines with perfect comic timing (""Let off some steam, Bennett"").

167,bannonanthony,"Great fun, but plausibility has gone bye-bye!",7,19 December 2004,"After TERMINATOR, Governor Arnie's career was off and running and this film has got to be one of his best. It's full of quotable wise-cracks and great action sequences. Arnie is good in his role as John Matrix and is given good support by Vernon 'Road Warrior' Wells as a former member of his unit gone bad and Dan Hedaya as the Latin American dictator-wannabe.Fans of CHARMED should look out for a VERY young Alyssa Milano as Matrix's daughter, who has been kidnapped by the bad guys and who Arnie must rescue in just over 24 hours. Rae Dawn Chong is good as the everyday girl thrown into s wild situation but she adapts well and lends our hero good support. Some moments of the film my make you wince, a good example being the Garden Shed scene, but COMMANDO delivers great action by the boatload. Just check your brain at the door and you should be okay.",Commando
168,MUFCOK,One-liner after One-liner,7,26 September 2014,"This is a good fun action movie. It has everything an Arnie, 1980's action flick should have. Weapons, explosions, lots of bad guys and of course, memorable one-liners.The story is of course a very simple one, Arnie's daughter gets kidnapped in order to blackmail Arnie into killing the president. Arnie takes it upon himself to disobey those orders and starts a one man war to kill everyone & anyone who gets in his way. There is no character development, no emotion, no sub plot, nothing realistic but it sure is entertaining. Now Arnie is in no way shape or form, a good actor but he does his job fantastically in this film. He is not cast to show off his acting skills, he is cast because he is a man-machine with presence and successfully brings a comical aspect to his movies with perfectly timed one-line quotes.This movie is downright ridiculous. Arnie, jumps from a movie plane during take-off and lands in a knee deep swamp – unhurt. He crashes a car at high speed into a post, without a seatbelt – unhurt. He rips a phone booth out of a wall. He avoids every gunshot, even at close range, the list goes on. Does any of this matter? No! If you are looking for a realistic film then this certainly isn't for you.The character 'Cindy' is by far the biggest negative in this film. She isn't needed what so ever, Arnie could quite easily have managed on his own. Her attempt at one-liners also go down like a led balloon. The kid is also irritating but thankfully she doesn't get too much screen time.Brain-dead action movies are certainly not my favourite movie genre. I can however, appreciate that this is a good one! I thoroughly enjoyed watching it but I wouldn't give it a top end rating because of this.Start the movie, sit back, and enjoy this movie for what it is.7/10",Commando
169,piratecannon,He Eats Green Berets for Breakfast,8,26 December 2012,"The past couple of years has seen Hollywood trying to duplicate the gritty (and insanely ridiculous) action movies of the 1980′s, The Expendables being the most recent example that springs to mind. For all its efforts, though, nothing has truly come close to replicating the frenzied concoction of laughs and gores that defined the genre only three decades prior. In my mind, a prime example of the ""golden age"" of action movies is Commando.Whether or not Schwarzenegger and company meant for this offering to be taken seriously is up for debate, but, I mean, come on: when your introductory credits sees Mr. Universe toting a freshly cut-down tree while simultaneously petting a deer in a meadow, you know there's at least some tongue-in-cheek undertones reverberating through the production.And that, of course, is what makes Commando so appealing. Its wise- cracking protagonist survives impossible odds, and the only thing the audience really cares about is what it is that finally breaks the needle off of the ""awesome"" scale: the corny dialogue or the unfathomable body count (or, more than likely, some combination of the two). Some examples: after Arnie breaks his captor's neck just as a commercial airliner is prepping to leave a runway (and before he falls from the plane some several hundred feet in the air and lands safely in a marsh below), he reports to a stewardess, ""Please don't disturb my friend: he's dead tired."" But that's only the beginning. Later, we're treated to such nuggets as: ""I eat green berets for breakfast, and right now I'm very hungry"" (Arnie then proceeds to demolish said adversary); ""I had to let him go"" (in response to questions about a villain that he drops off the side of a cliff); ""Let off some steam, Bennett"" (after impaling one of the main antagonists with a pipe in a boiler room as literal steam gushes from his abdomen); and the list goes on.If you're looking for some action-fueled hilarity that knows exactly what it's trying accomplish, look no further than Commando. Seriously, though: where else can you see the Governator kill people by throwing buzz saw blades like ninja stars?",Commando
170,uffe-5,Good action BUT......,2,4 April 1999,"Commando is just another lousy Rambo-wannabe. Oooooohh Arnie shoots people to pieces and cut arms off.Surely boring movie. For a start the action is OK. But after ten minutes i feel sick. Not that i'm scared of blood or something. I can watch ''Braindead'' or ''Bad Taste'' without throwing up but this is so over the edge as it ever can be. The end of this movie....MISERY! i just can't stand it! The only thing that happens is that Arnie in a Rambo-looking way shoots people. After five minutes of shooting and kiling it gets soooo boring! It sucks so hard! When i'm almost asleep Arnie cuts an arm off. Now THATS cool. But i'm afraid that's the only cool about this endless carnage. Don't get me wrong i like when people kills, and especially when the hero is a Rambo-looking guy, but this is just too much. Finally to throw up on this movie extra much, its sooooo ridicilous to see Arnie lift up a pay-phone in the air. I mean...... OOOHHH i can't complain this much. It's against my rules.",Commando
171,thehumanduvet,Wooden but spectacular,6,16 April 2002,"Classic dumb Arnie actioner here, with all manner of awards due to the cast for managing to keep straight faces throughout. Arnie is a retired superman dragged back into fighting and army stuff for some reason or other, he picks up some nice lady who randomly starts firing bazookas all over the shop, goes and kills a few thousand baddies, rescues the princess, kills the evil honchos and heads home to live happily ever after. But who cares, this is about one man who never misses and never gets hit by the million bullets sprayed at him by hordes of baddy machine guns (maybe they sell defective ones to evil-looking people), sloggin his way through an awesome number of enemies, while slurring out one-liners of incredible wit and sophistication. Well, one-liners.  Like watching an expert play a console shoot-em-up, big dumb fun.",Commando

173,Filmdokter,An entertaining but dumb movie,7,2 March 2021,This is the default Schwarzenegger 80's action movie. The story is nonexistent and the acting is wooden. But damn....this is one hell of an entertaining film! Maybe it is just good childhood memories (I was born in '82) but I'm just laughing my ass off and I'm amusing myself 100%. Great memorable quotes and Schwarzenegger at his peak condition. It is dumb and nowhere near as good as other 80's Schwarzenegger classics such as Predator or Terminator but still two hours of popcorn entertainment,Commando
174,talllwoood13,a lot of fun,8,13 September 2021,"I have never heard of Commando. Considering the movie is almost 40 years old and decided to watch a lot of Arnold's movies. Starting off with a few bombs this is one of the first ones I'm watching in some sort of random order I'd actually recommend people watch.This movie starts off with a series of hits by a hitman and there is a ton of homo erotic under tones. I don't know if that's just me. I'm sure they spawned a million fan fictions. I want to know what drugs they were on in certain parts of this movie the opening with Arnold and his daughter and of course that iconic last fight scene. The opening score is so awful with the saxophone music. Why is every action hero named John. After Kirby who looks like an actor I should know leaves and some hit squad shoots at everyone John goes into kill mode. How badly was the perimeter secured. They know how awesome he is but only sent what feels 6 or 8 people? At least John shoots the first guy trying to make John make a deal to get his daughter back. However that car scene with the car that doesn't work and riding down a mountain was really silly. The fun kind of silly like the opening of the James Bond movie Goldeneye (1995) with Pierce Brosnan pretty much sky diving into a nose diving plane. Why I can't remember.Benet looks like someone playing dress up to be in a Queen cover band. Like he's some chubby Freddie Mercury. He looks too nice, too old and more importantly he doesn't have that bad guy charisma. He looks like a shop class teacher or a likable uncle who will buy you beer or smokes.The daughters dialogue is pretty well done. More than the usual banter child actors are given to say in movies such as ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Jingle All The Way"". However her clothing choice I have no idea what the fashion back then was but it seems like she's too old to wear any of that crap.Cindy cannot act. At least she isn't this 10 out of 10 super model or a woman half Arnold's age like in a typical Steven Seagal movie.The movies score is awful for the sound track of licensed songs and original compositions.I love how in the 80s you could pretty much walk into a plane if you had a ticket. None of this 2 to 4 hour get there early and the show security puts on scanning people to get on a plane like there is now. When John gets on the plane he almost immediately breaks the guys neck. When people die it doesn't take too long to soil themselves. Everyone in that flight would have smelled him. When Arnold jumps out of the plane there is no reason he shouldn't be in a wheel chair or dead. It's not supposed to be the most serious movie every made or accurate. Fun matters more I understand that but still. No one notices Arnold running around the air port? I love how convenient he finds the guy in the ugly yellow Porsche.I still have no idea why Arnold messes up Cindys (African woman) car seat after he gets out of the Sherman Oaks Gallaria mall which was used in many movies. Seeing this movie you can really appreciate how much Arnold's acting has improved or the writers got much better. I love how he swings from one part of the mall to another before fighting an unnecessary amount of security guards. There is no way they need that many security guards. When they escape and chase after the Porsche I'm surprised no cops pulled them over because of the fact there's a seat missing from the car. How or why does Arnold not use the pit maneuver when driving after that ugly yellow Porsche. I mean shouldn't commandos know that sort of stuff. I'm sure he did more than just jump out of planes or hide in jungles. However that drop scene is one the most manly scenes I've seen in ages. You almost don't notice the dummy. I love how he cruises around in the beaten up car. Again where are the cops in this movie to pull him over and say his car doesn't look safe and should get towed or repaired.Another complaint I have is why would Cindy help John. You shoot at anyone sane even once and they are done. But not Cindy! In that hotel I can't believe how silly it is. No one phones the cops and a couple is still next door having sex while these two people exchange bullets. I love how almost any car Arnold sits in starts like an early Grand Theft Auto video game and in his case he 99.9% of the time does not reload his guns like he's playing with cheat codes. However getting back to Cindy they shoot at her again and she still wants to be there. Does she have Stockholm syndrome? She seems over qualified with all she knows about planes being refueled in such a place and so forth however she is the glue that keeps this nonsensically fun movie together. At least the gun store had a silent alarm and for some reason they have a rocket launcher and let the black woman walk out of the store with it. How nice of the store for giving out free samples as the cops don't even notice her there in the store. How did the police show up so quickly to that gun store and why does it have such an array of higher end weapons than I feel it should. Even Sterling Archer or James Bond would drool at some of the selection.When Arnold is in the back of a police truck why is there no escort or anything and most importantly why was the missile launcher loaded? However I love where the first bullet goes. When they stealing the plane uzi are not that accurate. I don't know why the air force gave up so quickly trying to find them on the radarWhy Arnold goes commando outside the plane and on the boat is unnecessary. There is no way that plane had all of those supplies. He comes out with a shotgun, what looks like an AK47, grenades, more rockets for that rocket launcher.When they finally see the dead body why didn't the cartel or whatever the guy is in give his men a satellite phone they run for a pay phone.When Arnold infiltrates the compound that throat slit looked so fake it's like his knife didn't even touch the guys neck. When he starts placing explosives those look like claymores yet Arnold presses some button and they magically turn into plastic explosives. However who cares about that, this is one of the best shoot outs I've seen in a while especially with that rocket launcher. However how does almost no one spot him firing an unsurpessed AK47 into a crowd of people. The director seemed to care more about Arnold looking good. However I'll give them some credit Arnold runs out of ammo and has to use some improvised melee combat. This last shoot out really reminds me of the 1990 movie ""Marked For Death"" with Steven Seagal. What surprises me is how many men are on this compound yet they sent so little to get Arnold. I guess 90% of them did not have green cards.I'll not spoil the ending but this is totally worth watching. Would I watch this again? Absolutely. This is one of the better movies I've seen in a while. It was silly but really fun.",Commando
175,Mr. Pulse,A toss up...,7,15 April 2001,"...between this film and ""Batman and Robin"" for the title of stupidest, most uninintentionally funny movie Arnold has made.  It's a close one here.  Both are exceedingly stupid, both are absent of intellgient characters and dialogue, and both feature an inordinate number of groan-worthy puns.  And both are really, really fun to watch.""Commando"" was Arnold's first vehicle after the success of ""The Terminator"" so even though he plays a human here, you can feel the influence of Terminator in all of it, he's very very tough, and he bares his chest a lot, and has super-human strength.Schwarzenneger's titular Commando is Col. John Matrix, a retired Vet who was the greatest soldier ever, but he's done with that now, he just wants to live a quiet, super-sacarine sweet life with his daughter Jennie (played by Alyssa Milano).  The opening credits play over a montage of John and Jennie playing with deer, and swimming, and kissing a lot.  It's oddly disturbing. Then, in a plot that doesn't even really try to explain itself, or need to, Jennie is kidnapped, and John has to only half a day to save her before the proverbial jig is up.  In that time he kills about seventy-five guys all by himself, breaks a lot of stuff, actually flips a car off of its side and rights it, and sticks a rake into someone's chest.  In that same span of eleven hours it also somehow goes from day to night to day again, so maybe movie takes place in some weird alternate dimension where the earth spins faster in its axis.The continuity gaffs like that one and others are just a tiny bit of the fun.  There are also some superb stunts, horrible one liners (""Don't wake my friend- he's dead tired"") and the kind of violence-and-death-for-violence-and-death's-sake that you don't get in movies of the nineties that were required to have more of a conscience.  It's a good thing we at least got this movie before they cracked down.  I don't think I would have otherwise gotten to see a man have his arm chopped off in front of him while he watched.This film is a cheesy delight.  From Arnold's blatant ways of exposing his chest (That shirt that's cut really low, wearing nothing but a Speedo to paddle to shore, only to dress when he gets to the beach) to the love interest assistant who is not nearly attractive enough to garner the kind of attention she gets, this movie has it all.

The characters are funny esp. The villains. In this film you will never get bored for a minute as it revolves around a mission in which Arnold is forced to do in lieu of his daughter's life. The movie is full of thrilling action in which Arnold alone kills more than 50 men in variety of ways. Also when Arnold goes off to kill his enemies who kidnapped his daughter, someone said it is going to be WORLD WAR III. This is still funny and there are many more of this sort!There are less dialogs in the film and more activity. One liners are the bright points.

But when guerilla's kidnap Jenny from their home, Matrix goes back in action.I could watch this movie every week and not get sick of it.  It's very entertaining.

179,andrewmerritt-31652,This movie wouldn't have happened without Arnold,9,14 November 2019,"Commando stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as John Matrix a retired army veteran who is forced back into action after a group of terrorists kidnap his daughter. If you were to look up what the definition of a man is, Commando would be up there. Unlike with some action movies movies, this movie is not afraid to be tough because it walks-the walk, and it talks-the talk too. Back when I first watched this, I thought this was the greatest action movie masterpieces the 80s had to offer. Now that I am an adult I can still say that this is the greatest action movie masterpieces the 80s had to offer. This is one of those movies where you can turn your brain off and accept it for what it has to offer. And if you can't accept this movie for what it is, then you're going to have a bad time. But that's what I enjoyed about this. The way I look at Commando is everyone involved with this was on just the right amount of cocaine or some other narcotic. And then in walked Arnold Schwarzenegger. And when he agreed to star in Commando, they knew they have their movie. And then everyone created a script that's not deep, or will make you question your sanity. But instead they made something that's pure action that only Arnold Schwarzenegger could deliver. So in the end, put down the current action movies, and go watch a real action movie.",Commando
180,blurnieghey,One Of The Best 80's Action Flicks EVER,10,22 December 2020,"There are already so many deservedly glowing reviews of this film there really isn't much for me to say, except that, as a fan of low-budget action-adventure flicks, one has to recognize that at some point there were a handful of golden master templates from which all the shlock drew its inspiration and such is the case with Commando. This movie is the embodiment of 80's action-adventure and they could just as well have named the film ""80's Action-Adventure"" instead of ""Commando"" and it would have been perfectly fine.So, what else is there to say? After a lengthy intro in which we establish that dad and daughter do, in fact, love each other to even the most obtuse viewer (and I assume there were plenty at the time), we get treated to a non-stop barrage of an invincible hero doing nothing but kick ass and get away with ridiculous stunts that no one could ever pull off in a million years. Too many great scenes to list, but I really like the airplane escape scene and, to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever attempted such a stunt since. Because it's too stupid, you say? No, because it's too awesome! You can't take this film seriously and it has actually improved with age in my opinion.

Jenny is kidnapped by Bennett (Vernon Wells), one of John's former underlings. Bennett's boss, exiled Latin American dictator Arius (Dan Hedaya), demands that John assassinate the president of Val Verde so Arius can reinstate himself as dictator.John is put on a plane but escapes, and sets off to rescue Jenny.He enlists the aid of stewardess Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong). John and Cindy track down the island where Jenny is being held, and Arnie wades through hundreds of Fidel Castros before a final girly-man fight with Bennett and a triumphant rescue.Classic 80's throwaway actioner, leave your brains at the door and enjoy. Far better than Rambo II, c'mon, John Matrix is not carrying around any boring post-Vietnam stress to justify a killing rampage, he just wants his daughter back so she can continue to make him mystery meat sandwiches, and so they can frolick in the pool together once more. You just know you're in for some a*ss-kickin good times when a bad guy delivers Arnie the ultimatum, ""You gonna cooperate...right?"" and Arnie answers him with a ""Wrong!"" and backs it up with some hot lead. Hot damn! What a movie! It just gets better when Rae decides, for whatever reason, to spring Arnie from a paddy wagon. What does she do? She fires a friggin ROCKET at the damn thing. With Arnie, and two hapless, innocent cops inside. Way to go, girl!We've got a great villain in the hilarious Dan Hedaya, he's about as intimidating as the Dad from American Pie. But u gotta love his delicious madness: ""If you try anything...I will mail her to you in pieces..."" This movie is hilarious. If it's not tough-guy Arnie taking every possible opportunity to show off his flexed biceps, it's Australian Chopper-wannabe Vernon Wells, whose strange obsession with Arnie is homoerotic in the extreme. He wants to look into Arnie's eyes, to see what's ""going on in there"" while he slides his ""blade"" in...uh huh...""Shoot em Up"" video games owe a lot to movies like this. The one-man-army scenes resemble Cold Fire or Medal of Honor, ie hundreds of bad guys, lone soldier blowing them all away in various locations, etc.Note: Bill Paxton appears briefly as a coastguard radio operator towards the end.It's all in good fun.

182,knucklebreather,Great mindless 80s action,7,21 March 2011,"""Commando"" is vintage Arnold. The plot is simple and effective at creating heroes and villains - Arnold plays John Matrix, whose daughter is kidnapped by the second most awesome commando in the world, Bennett, who Matrix personally trained. Matrix has just a few hours to escape from his captors, save his daughter, and (of course) get revenge against all of Bennett's flunkies.The movie has everything you could ask for from a fun, dumb action flick - awesome action sequences and those oh-so-cheesy one-liners, usually delivered right after a bad guy dies horrifically, and perfectly fine pacing that keeps you interested and having fun. An added bonus of the movie is Rae Dawn Chong as a flight attendant, aspiring pilot and crack rocket launcher operator who tags along with Arnold as his wacky sidekick. She brings some great humor to the movie, sardonically commenting on the typical action flick absurdity, and the humor helps make this movie more than just a campy action flick with a laughable plot.Of course, the movie still is very campy, especially bad-guy Bennett and his hilarious ""Freddy Mercury on Steroids"" look (something the actor himself acknowledges). Whatever you're looking for in a mindless action flick, Commando is unlikely to disappoint!",Commando
183,stebird,"Remember when I promised to kill you last, I lied!",10,19 February 2018,"An ass kicking triumph from the greatest decade of action movies..., Commando stars big shot Arnie S in a typical no nonsense cool and camp ass whooping action beat-down!John Matrix is a retired special agent who lives in the secluded wilderness with his young daughter Jenny; alas Matrix is forced out of retirement when he and daughter Jenny get kidnapped by terrorists; Matrix is given the task of completing a mission for these bad guys otherwise Jenny will be killed..., but Matrix has other plans, and the clock is ticking.It's a race against the clock for Matrix who only has eleven hours to find and save his daughter and take down the bad guys..., it's always nice when the hero is faced with an imminent deadline as the action portrayed in the film is quickfire and never has the chance to slow down or lose any rhythm. A particular favorite moment of mine happened towards the beginning of the film when Matrix has to escape the plane he has been forced to board, but will he have time to make this daring escape, logic dictates that there wouldn't be, but it's pretty amazing and heart pumping watching Matrix escape to the wheels while the plane is racing along the runway to takeoff, only to jump off at least fifty feet in the air and fall into a pond as the plane has become airborne. That very scene illustrates what the rest of film is going to be about, incredible, improbable feats of strength, impossible and over the top action scenes with plenty of gunfire and crashes (this is an Arnie film after all). Some say Commando is one of Arnie's weaker films with too many cliches and ridiculous tropes, but I disagree entirely, the cliches and the tropes signify exactly what an action movie should be..., Commando and other films of the same ilk aren't intelligent, they don't encourage you to think, they're proper popcorn munchers where you simply sit back and enjoy the over the top grandeur they're offering you. As a whole, Commando is a wickedly simple and highly enjoyable 1980s action flick that doesn't ask too much of its audience, embrace it!",Commando
184,RussianPantyHog,Utter Rubbish,3,19 December 2004,"I love most of Arnie's films, but this is plain awful. Not as bad as T3, but a close second. It's also ""aged"" badly too and has a real naff 80s feel throughout, totally unlike Terminator or The Running Man. My main criticism is an actor called Dan Hedaya who I've never seen in anything else - and sincerely hope I never do. He plays the rogue Commando and is probably the worst actor I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie. There are Australian soap operas with more talented actors in them. He doesn't even have muscles, only a rather 'suspect' moustache. Sorry Dan (if you ever read this) but you were DREADFUL! The only thing that distinguishes this movie is the best continuity error I've ever seen. I'm surprised no one else has noticed. There's a scene where Arnie and Rae Dawn Chong are in a red sports car, chasing one of the villains who's in a yellow Porsche. The Porsche is rammed several times and the drivers' side (the left hand side) is horribly smashed in. You can see the door, wing and rear panel seriously damaged. Then the Porsche crashes and turns over onto its drivers side, damaging it further. After Schwarzenegger's character has disposed of the hapless villain he turns the Porsche back onto its wheels and both he and the love interest climb in. Filmed from the passenger's side you see the car drive off and swing round and then for a clear two seconds the drivers' side of this Porsche is filmed as they speed away - COMPLETELY UNDAMAGED! Arnold himself was good, and so was Bill Duke as another Commando-gone-bad. In fact, i think Mr Duke would have made a MUCH better lead villain - but the material they had to work with was utter bargain basement stuff. I did like the music for the film and James Horner (Titanic & Liar Liar) IS a genius, but all-in-all it's very disappointing. If you want to see Arnie playing a commando, Predator is a MUCH better movie. I give this weak effort 3.5 out of 10.",Commando

186,KillerLord,Mindless and Shallow,5,20 September 2008,"The only thing that I like about the movie is the poster. In the poster, the man Arnold Schwargenneger wears a full military suit with muscles flexing and a gun held on the shoulders. Arnie really looks good in this pose and that is where the goodness associated with Commando begins to diminish. It is among the worse movies of Arnold I have ever seen. Even from the standard of an action movie, the story line and the depth is poor. And there is hardly anything called realism in the movie. Of course, some people like movies where there is no realism and maybe they can have a fun time watching this movie over and over again. But for those who like action to be accompanied with some story that justifies or compliments the action, they are in for a disappointment.The overall plot is trivial. Arnie is leading a retired life. Suddenly, he is forced out of retirement when his daughter gets kidnapped. And off he goes chasing after them. And in the process, he kills many people. Of course, I don't mind one man killing many people - that is what being an action hero is all about anyway but the fact that he is using a gun and dropping them down like flies is not something you can watch over and over again.Arnie walks across a field and shoots his gun at a couple of people. While not a single bullet even reaches him, all his bullets reach the enemies and they all fall down like flies. The only better scene is a physical fist fight between the villain and Arnie. Here, we see that Arnold is indeed a human being and can take some damage. But rest of the movie is too overdone. Unbelievable and highly unrealistic action scenes coupled by a loose plot makes this movie a one-time watch and forget kind of a movie.I might as well mention that the soundtrack is good. But overall, the movie is a bit lame especially compared to other greater movies of Arnold. Overall verdict, I would say a movie worth watching over a rented DVD or cable TV. Cheers.",Commando
187,KIDOLOHKEN,It was fun enough.,7,15 October 2020,"It was an interesting movie with a very simple script that I could easily enjoy. I was wondering how it was possible to watch this movie with such a simple script without getting bored. I guess it's because of the kidnapping genre. Also, I think it's because of Schwarzenegger's charm when he made his debut. Many action scenes are made it unnecessarily longer. This film is probably the rare thing that a screenwriter should not copy the script, but it's an interesting movie. Schwarzenegger is too strong and he isn't hit the bullets anyway. I wasn't sure what that island Schwarzenegger was attacking was. But that didn't matter in this movie.
The most noteworthy thing in this film is the existence of black heroine.
I think it was quite innovative rather than unusual to have a black heroine in this era. It made the movie feel wild and very good.",Commando

I didn't see Comando until over a decade after it came out. I found the movie to be really really dumb. Realism did not exist in that movie. Arnold can just about take out an entire army, while they can only hit him once or twice. And this girl that Arnold didn't even know until he basically kidnapped her was anxious to help Arnold even though she was at great risk of dying.But if your in the mood for a little brainless fun and just watching Arnold kick *** and kill people, this is the perfect movie for the occasion. It does have many witty lines, mostly from Arnold. The acting is, although not bad, nothing special. This movie really highlighted Arnold, who did fine for the part.It only has two or three or four main bad guys and about 150 nameless bad guys, all of which are there for Arnold to take out in a cool way. So the characters are nothing big in this movie. Aside from Arnold, his daughter, his girlfriend and maybe two bad guys, all the characters are pretty boring. The storyline is just fodder for the fight scenes with Arnold.I'd recommend you go rent this movie when you're in the mood for some action/violent fun.

Anyway, the movie: 3rd all-time best One-Man Army flick. Pick your favorite 2 Rambo movies for the 1st and 2nd slots. But this movie has a charm that Rambo lacks. Perhaps it's is the pure plot: a father (John ; Arnold) trying to save his daughter (Jenny ; Alyssa Milano). I actually thought they made a great father-daughter team but enough about that: this movie is about gratuitous bullets. And it delivers! You'll be treated with dozens of completely anonymous bad guys with machine guns popping out from bushes and the like only to get mowed down by Arnold... uh... I mean John.

198,Knuckle,Better than winning the sex lottery,10,8 April 2007,"Commando is by far one of the BEST damn movies ever made and is one of the most overlooked American movie masterpieces of all time.In it, John Matrix (Arnold) is an ex-member of some super secret special forces team who is spending his retirement raising his daughter Jenny as a single parent (apparently Matrix's wife was crushed by a falling meteor, because if she'd been assassinated by ninjas, the whole movie would have been about Arnold turning ninjas into bloody skin bags of broken bones. And no, she didn't leave him - no respectable 80's action woman would ever be insane enough to leave a man whose biceps were bigger around than her waist).His life as a single dad comes to a crashing halt when an ex-member of his squad, Bennett, blows up his house and steals his kid. It's a simple your-daughter-back-for-a-quickie-assassination scheme, but Matrix isn't going to have any of it. He commits brutal, cold-blooded atrocities all over 20 pound weaklings as he wrings the information of his daughter's whereabouts from Arius' (Dan Hedaya) henchmen. Normally, that would make Matrix a ruthless bully, but the soundtrack does a good job of reminding us that due process really isn't due to child-nabbing scumbags.Along the way, he picks up a plucky airline stewardess named Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) and she decides that aiding and abetting a psychotic felon who can lift cars is what she wants to do with her Saturday night.And it's a good thing, too. Without her, Matrix may have had to figure out where the bad guys are all on his own, break himself out of jail, load his own stolen goods into his own stolen car, and pose as his own prostitute before beating another hapless man to death with his bare hands.The final scene, where Matrix pounds an entire banana republic military into a smoking, bloody spot on the carpet is pure gold. About seven hundred men (cunningly played by the same six actors) prove the old gunfighter's adage that it's not all about who shoots first, it's all about who shoots last - with the magical gun that doesn't need reloading.And then after plowing his way through the Los Lobos militaria fan club, he faces off against his nemesis - Bennett. Now, at first glance, it may seem like a no brainer; Hitler's short, fat clone vs. Thor may seem to be a foregone conclusion. Don't let the paunch, the flabby arms, the huffing and puffing fool you; Bennett is more than a match for Matrix and his body-by-In-N-Out is a ruse to lull Matrix into a false sense of security.Matrix convinces Bennett that a knife fight is the best way to resolve their differences and while Bennett may be quicker on the draw, he learns that guns are no match for steam pipes and witty repartee. Jenny is recovered, all the bad guys are dead (oftentimes, several times over) and the cavalry arrives just in time to jam out to the badass end credits music.This movie is a pillar of cinema and deserves to be worshiped as a graven idol. 10 out of 10",Commando
199,joeravioli,The 80s? Right here.,6,8 June 2015,"""I eat green berets for breakfast!""Commando feels strangely like a paleontological dig through the horrifying era that those of my generation remember (often with a shudder) as the 80s, a time when our parents had terrifyingly long hair, listened to sappy music, rode dinosaurs, and watched movies like this horrendous time waster. That being said, it fulfills its role as a cinematic ambassador for this mythical era quite well. The action begins in the first minute, and doesn't end until the last. The dialogue is fraught with hilariously bad puns. Everyone looks 80s. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks like a God, breaks stuff like a God, and cannot be shot by anyone excluding the villains with some significance to the plot. He talks like a God too. They probably needed a vat of body oil for each individual frame with him in it.The film stars our good friend Arnold as some sort of retired soldier, living with his daughter in the middle of nowhere. But of course, the baddies show up (who are either gay, black, Mexican, or stalkers), kidnap his daughter, threaten to kill him unless he kills some other guy, and stick him on a plane. Arnie being Arnie, jumps off the plane, goes back, and wipes the floor with pretty much everyone's heinies, with the help of a nice young woman whose only role is to operate vehicles, scream, and make hilarious commentary (""These guys eat too much red meat!""). Best of all, all of this craziness is to an awesome 80s soundtrack. Nice!The film is charming in its awfulness, never letting complex moral issues arise, literally sticking to its guns (with both fingers wrenching the triggers like there's no tomorrow). Rather, it pursues its own insane premises with a reckless but linear abandon, fast, formulaic, and fun, no underlying message or emotion to ever get in the way of this fanatical ideal. It glorifies violence to such an extreme extent, that it eventually becomes hard to watch. Thus, it is fun, but not even remotely good.So go ahead, watch it. You won't get any insight into humanity, that's for sure. But a good, long, 1980's style battle scene that leaves five hundred people dead? Yeah, you'll get that.",Commando

201,DaRick89,"A Rambo-type film, Commando is cheap and shoddy, but it's non-stop entertainment makes it worthwhile",6,2 February 2006,"Commando is one of those Rambo-type films. Muscleman comes in to save someone and Muscleman kills lots of people. In Rambo it was Sylvester Stallone, here it is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Let me say that this is in no way a technically good film. In fact, technically, this is almost as cheap-looking as Sniper 2. The cast is ordinary, the plot is stupid and the special effects look entirely fake. However, Commando is still a worthwhile way to spend a night, because it never stops being entertaining, whether you are laughing at it's endemic stupidity or watching as Arnie blows up stuff and kills people (80 I think).Why is the plot dumb? Well, to start off, it is cliché-ridden. We've seen this a thousand times before: someone gets kidnapped, hero goes in and kicks a whole lot of ass.The dialogue is pretty funny, kickstarting Arnie's one liners: ""I'll be back, Bennett!"", ""Don't disturb my friend. He's dead tired."" and ""Remember Sully, when I told you I'd kill you last? I lied."", along with other gems. He then drops him off a cliff, a scene which for some reason tied me in stitches.Another scene which tied me in stitches was the scene where Arnie decided to come to the party, killing everyone and blowing up stuff in the space of around 10 minutes in gratuitous ways, such as planting mines and blowing them up, causing 10 big explosions (?!). I noticed that the truck next to one of the exploding buildings just kept on going. If you need proof of this film's technical shoddiness, this is it.Anyway, I'll finish off by saying that if you want entertainment, this is your movie. Otherwise. stay far, far away.I'll round my mark up from two criteria, which will give you more insight into my thoughts on Commando: Technical Quality: 1/5 stars Entertainment Quality: 5/5 stars Overall: 3/5 stars",Commando

The action is awesome, the one-liners are the funniest i've ever seen and the villains are complete psychos, especially Bennett. Anyway, the best bit has to be the last 20 minutes or so when Arnold gets all the weapons he can find: Rocket Launcher, Machine Guns, Bombs, Grenades, Hand Guns you name it, and takes on an army of around 50 men.This film is just meant to be fun and entertaining and it certainly achieves it.

In theory, Arnold Schwarzenegger made several series of violent action thrillers that he is chiefly remembered for. The film Commando is generally very good as Arnie delivers his usual ""I'll be be back"" lines. It's just a film and
Arnie as a semi-retried marine John Matrix whom springs back into action after learning of a terrorist and kidnapping organisation was vowing revenge on him and his daughter. It also gives few insights on the middle 1980s including the dress senses (e.g. Sully's suit), though acceptable at the time but would look rather strange nowadays.

Even for an Arnold Schwartzenegger vehicle it is ridiculously overblown and unrealistic. But it can't be denied as a film capable of giving off great entertainment. It is like watching a child's ""BANG BANG"" fantasy unroll on screen, and its hard not to get just a little drawn in.Arnie stars as the indestructible one man army John Matrix, a retired special forces Colonel who's trying to live a quiet life with his daughter (Alyssia Milano) in their pleasant leafy retreat. This is threatened however, when General Kirby, a former colleague of John's brings ill news of danger. Members of Matrix's old team have recently been eliminated, and Kirby fears John is next. Soon enough John's daughter is kidnapped by the group in question, and all hell ensues.The rest of the film follows John as he performs increasingly macho and dangerous feats to try and track down his daughter. Obviously, this must involve stripping down to the waist to show off oiled body, whilst firing just about every different gun he can get his hands on. But wait there's more....he also rips out a car seat, jumps back to his feet after being hit by a car going fast enough to cripple him and escapes from a moving aeroplane. The ridiculously Rambo-esquire scenes near the end feature John using one arm to fire a heavy machine gun from the hip at an oncoming crowd of 'card board cut-out' like soldiers as if its an everyday activity.Loud, proud 80's gung-ho action at its peak, it has its place in cinema.

What you will get from this film is guns, one-liners, blood, muscles, and clichés.This movie is a pretty good action flick. I mean, its not the Terminator or John Wick but its pretty good. By far the best element in this film is the cheesiness. You know that the actors and staff are not taking this seriously and just want you to have a good time.Arnold is the ultimate male symbol in this film. You can see that in the first scene in which he appears. He has a chainsaw in one arm and a f*cking giant log in the other while wearing a tank top. There really was nobody else who could play this character in the movie.The one-liners are great. They are so cheesy and good. You really get a kick every time you hear one.The action is pretty fake of course, but you can have a lot of fun with it if you don't mind that a machine gun can shoot forever and never run out of ammo. This movie really feels like a video game. The only problems I have with this movie are the female lead, which I really didn't find useful at all and didn't really know why she was helping Matrix just because. Also, she was pretty stupid.The other problem I have with the film is that the action doesn't pick up until the end. Don't get me wrong, there are some pretty good action scenes sprinkled here and there but I think they should have spent more time in the final battle which is really fun and the best part of the film.Another thing I cant help but notice in this film is that Vernon Wells (Bennet) looks an awful lot like Freddie Mercury with that facial hair.",Commando

She acts there with success, one of his first major roles.Commando looks like a big series B. One of the worst movies with Mr. Universe. But a film you can watch again with pleasure even years later. A very correct, good and effective realization, to serve the action of a very simple action scenario, which can be summarized as follows: John Matrix, a former commando, was compelled to murder a politician if he wants to see her daughter alive. He refuses, and will save her! It can rarely be simpler and more like scenario and it works well.Note some cults like the famous reply ""I'll be back"" or ""He gave me 100,000 dollars, you know, it's when I knew it was you I said I'll do it for nothing"" Bennett ""You're scared you bastard, well you should because you got the green beret before you gonna butter face! ""I swallow green berets for breakfast and I just really hungry! "" ""Spit your dirty steam rot! ""... And the stage of final action, the final assault John Matrix is famous too.

213,goreilly40,One of my favourite action movies,9,1 August 2015,"The reason why I've given this such a high score is that although this may not be Citizen Kane or Godfather Part 2, it ticks almost every box when it comes to great action movies. Unlike other action movies, this one actually had a plot which was plausible and made sense and it gave the protagonist a valid reason for his actions, rather than being a one man wrecking crew just for the hell of it. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives us a creditable portrayal of a person who is trying to leave his past behind and lead a life of peace but is unwillingly dragged back into it and as he puts it, ""All f**king hell breaks loose"" as a result. The dialogue could be described as macho and cheesy one liners but that's one of the stronger aspects of the movie as it punctuates the action. Explosives and fight scenes are a plenty as you'd expect and this featured some of the more memorable action scenes of the 80's, maybe the action and Arnie's displays of strength were perhaps a bit over the top but I suppose it was the 80's so it was the time of excess. Vernon Wells and Dan Hedaya both give excellent portrayals as vengeful villains who have old score's to settle with the protagonist. So to finish, you've got witty one liners, plenty of gun fire and explosives, a plausible plot, a ruthless villain and a determined hero who will do whatever it takes to make the baddies pay for what they've done and the customary show down at the end between hero and villain, what more could you ask for from an action movie?",Commando

For that reason you dont mind that Schwarzenegger kills about 500 guys with a gun that never runs out of bullets and that he never seems to get shot himself. It's one of those films that you start watching and after 5 minutes in you say to yourself ""this is going to be a laugh"". With its dodgy acting and none storyline it still is good. Only Arnie would be able to pull a film like this off. The bad guy is just terrible and he dresses like a complete disaster and it seems like he needs to let off some steam.I give it 6 /10 although it is an all time fan favourite film I believe I'm being really nice with that score, just because it's so enjoyable.

217,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,You Can't Always Get What You Want,9,3 February 2021,"After seeing this 1985 all-time action spectacle many times in the past I dusted off the DVD with a specific mission, to prove the widely-held theory that the real motivation of villain Bennett (Vernon Wells) was unrequited love for Arnold's John Matrix. However, much like Matrix's former comrades who simply hoped to have trash picked up or to sell a fine Cadillac, I discovered you can't always get what you want.After Bennett fakes his own death (needlessly destroying a perfectly serviceable trawler by the way) to smoke out the location of Matrix and his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano), his men ultimately capture both Matrices in a daring mountaintop raid on their cabin. We quickly discover the man holding the purse strings is former Val Verde president Arius (Aleppo-born Dan Hedaya), though Bennett claims he was willing to do this for free if it meant he could ""get his hands on"" Matrix for booting him off the old strike team. Since the rest of the team was also living the civilian life selling cars and whatnot this seems a puzzling reason to forego a $100,000 payday for reinstalling Arius as the leader of Val Verde (We know Arius can GET the job, but can he DO the job?).Meanwhile, in between the Matrix-Bennett sizzling storyline, scribe Steven de Souza shows us stylish scoundrel Sully and sixteen security sentinels scuffling with sky-swinging Schwarzenegger and sweet stewardess Cindy at the Sherman Oaks shopping center. In the words of Russian writer Yuri Testikov, ""God spoke through his pen.""Thinking John was successfully dispatched to dispatch the American puppet in charge of Val Verde, Arius awaits dispatches from the men he dispatched to give dispatches about John dispatching the despot. While they wait Bennett makes clear the high esteem the villain holds for John: ""If Matrix was here, he'd laugh {at your men} too"" and ""Matrix and I could kill every one of {your men}."" Okay Bennett, we get it.Perhaps one reason for the speculation about Bennett is his chainmail tank top, which he wears throughout the film over a black shirt. To better understand what is going on here fast forward to 1991's Seinfeld Episode 2.10: The Baby Shower. Much like George Costanza wearing a Bosco-stained red shirt to a planned encounter with the woman who wronged him, Bennett's meshy tank was likely part of some awkward night in Buenos Aires with Matrix after too many shots of Hesperidina.As the saga neared its conclusion without more evidence of Bennett's hypothetical attraction to Matrix, I concluded once again that like Sully stalking Rae Dawn Chong in a parking garage or the couple in the adjoining hotel room hoping to film uninterrupted content for their BetaMax adult film-by-mail service, you can't always get what you want.John and Cindy's seaplane lands near the Arius island stronghold for the final showdown, and if Arnold had waited to strip down to his Mr. Olympia speedo in front of Bennett perhaps we could have gathered more relevant data. However, as Matrix was power-rowing his raft through the waves like mighty Zeus piloting a hovercraft across the Aegean Sea, a startling development occurred. Bennett, having kept young Jenny from being abused by Arius and his goons for the whole day, loses his cool for the first time when he discovers that the little girl has dared to escape his protection. As Matrix engages swarms of enemy gunmen (side note: his first island kill has the most intense sideburns seen since the 60s...the 1860s) it is telling that Bennett chases Jenny rather than confront his supposed enemy in battle.Just before the climactic knife/pipe combat between Matrix and Bennett a subtle yet important piece of dialogue can be heard. As Jenny creeps around a steamy sub-basement she calls out hopefully ""Daddy?"" to which Bennett replies ""No, not Daddy."" Matrix then storms into the room and the pair exchange red hot mouthfuls of innuendo, such as ""put {it} in me, look me in the eye, see what's going on in there when you turn it"" ""don't deprive yourself of some pleasure"" ""C'mon Bennett let's party"" ""John I feel good, just like old times"" and ""I'm going to shoot you between the balls.""At the apex of the back and forth battle Matrix impales the Aussie with a metal didgeridoo, and the chance to find out once and for all whether Bennett's anger was fueled by unreciprocated lust dies along with him. To my chagrin, much like Henriques looking forward to the meal in first class and the Arius army hoping to someday get a pension, you can't always get what you want.But...if you try sometimes, you might find you get what you need. What I needed was released in 1994, a little film called Junior, and the puzzle was solved. Suddenly things from the beginning of the film made sense.Matrix and his obsession with gender: reading a Creem magazine article about Culture Club at the kitchen table, he blurts ""Why don't they call him Girl George, it would cut down on the confusion I think."" Right after Bennett's men kidnap Jenny, Matrix storms into her bedroom through a window and finds Diaz holding a handwritten Valentine ""I Love you Dad"" heart. While it first appears to be the same one on the fridge in the kitchen scene, it is actually a duplicate she secretly sent to her ""other Dad"" who provided half of her genetic material before implantation in the surrogate Matrix. Add these clues to Matrix repeatedly referring to Jenny as simply ""the girl,"" during the confrontation with Bennett, and the pieces fit. Bennett is Jenny's father, and the mystery is solved. As the closing credits roll, supergroup The Power Station says it all with ""We Fight For Love."" 9/10",Commando
218,Cross18,The best Rambo rip-off ever,7,5 January 2000,This is a great piece of entertainment.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the greatest action stars in history and he strikes with a vengeance in this cool flick.  Schwarzenegger plays a retired Special Forces Commando who comes out of retirement to track down his daughter who was kidnapped by a power hungry terrorist and a vengeful commando.  Great action and some great laughs.,Commando
219,patrick-91640,Perfect,9,14 November 2021,"Only a few minutes into the movie and you know what you're about to witness: the moment Arnie steps in, close-ups on the boots, muscles, and a chainsaw.That's it. The moment you are either sold or lost. I am not ashamed to admit: I was sold!",Commando
220,krisrox,Brilliant,8,12 February 2014,"I'll come out and join the vocal minority: ""Commando"" is sheer genius. It's loose, it's funny, it's irreverent. It has more memorable scenes than many top-250 movies. It casually immerses us in a parallel universe where cartoon logic rules, and doesn't bat an eye along the way. Schwarzenegger is funny, intimidating, ruthless and endearing at the same time - name one other actor who can do this! You could actually write a thesis about the tricks that take this flick to the next level. The direction is completely tongue-in-cheek from the opening montage onwards. The pace never lets up. The script appears shallow but is actually quite clever: it doesn't make any attempt to make sense from the start, goes left where other action flicks go right, and then introduces the Rae Dawn Chong character to point this out for us in this classic piece of Arnie dialogue...Cindy: You steal my car, you rip the seat out, you kidnap me, you ask me to help you find your daughter which I very kindly do, and then you get me involved in a shoot out where people are dying and there's blood spurting all over the place, and then I watch you rip a phone booth out of a wall, swing from the ceiling like Tarzan, and then there's a cop that's going to shoot you and I save you and they start chasing me. Are you going to tell me what's going on or what? Matrix: No.PS - I'm not driven by nostalgia. Watched it on Netflix last week, and was astonished how much I liked it.

221,Die Hard-3,Action-packed unrealism,5,22 October 1998,"This is one of those movies where Arnie goes around killing a lot of people and barely gets hurt.  It is about a retired army commando whose old enemies come by and kidnap his daughter.  He loves his daughter very much, so he must defeat the dictator Bennett, and retrieve his daughter.  This film is so stupid, it's funny at times.  He pulls off very unrealistic stunts sometimes and he has a few one-liners.  By the way, why did that girl come along and help out Arnie?  Wait, it's an Arnold Schwarzanegger film, so who cares.  The unrealism is so high, that at one point Arnie goes around with a gun, throws knives, shoots people while they shoot at him.  He must kill about 100 people in that very scene and he doesn't get shot once at all.  He only gets shot once at the very end.  Arnie is at his action best, but this is one of those no-brain movies, where you'll need to give your brain a holiday.  The ending climax is OK, but I just can't get over how unrealistic this film is.  It is pretty much violence from start to end and Arnie must kill over 200 people throughout the duration of the film.  For an action-lover, this could be good.  But if you're looking for an intelligent thriller, I think you should find another film and another actor.  7 out of 10.",Commando
222,fidelio74,"'Let off some steam, Bennett'",5,20 December 2010,"'Commando' is a wonderful piece of eighties excess. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as John Matrix, a retired colonel who lives in picturesque seclusion with his young daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). The opening credits have hardly finished rolling before the action explodes and never lets up until the deliciously overblown conclusion. In order to induce Matrix to assassinate a dictator of a South American country named Val Verde, one of Matrix's former colleagues named Bennett (Vernon Wells), after faking his own death in order to disappear, kidnaps John's daughter. But instead of meekly following orders, Matrix launches into action, using all his training and deadly skills to get his daughter back alive and take out anyone who stands in his way.Bennett is backed up by a motley crew of henchmen, among them the intimidating, man-of-few-words Cooke (Bill Duke, who would reteam with Schwarzenegger two years later for the similarly testosterone-fuelled 'Predator') and the sleazy Sully (David Patrick Kelly). Matrix eliminates them one by one as he works his way breathlessly towards Bennett. Along the way, he teams up with flight stewardess Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), who is reluctantly swept up in his campaign of mayhem.Early in the film, Matrix lays waste to the Galleria shopping mall, trouncing a whole team of hapless security guards, ripping a phone booth out of a wall and swinging, Tarzan-style, on a piece of bunting. This is a great action set piece, but my favourite is the one which sees Cindy freeing Matrix from a police truck using a rocket launcher which she accidentally fires backwards before successfully blowing the truck carrying Matrix off the road. Great stuff.The third act is pure escapism, as Matrix and Cindy, travelling by seaplane, arrive at the island where Jenny is being held. While Cindy stays with the plane and gets ready to call in the troops using the radio, Matrix embarks upon a very Rambo-like massacre of a seemingly endless number of enemy soldiers before finally going up against Bennett in a knifefight to the death in front of a horrified Jenny.'Commando' is anything but realistic. What it is is a thoroughly entertaining action film in which realism takes a backseat in favour of cartoonish violence. We know as soon as she is taken that Jenny will be rescued by her muscle-bound, mono-syllabic Dad; the fun is in finding out just how much destruction he is going to wreak along the way. The film was produced by Joel Silver, who has an incredible talent for producing crowd-pleasing blockbusters. Ten years later he would produce another action film called 'Fair Game' which is similar to 'Commando' in that both films have very lean running times - each movie clocks in at under the ninety-minute mark. Both films offer almost non-stop action and great stunts.Director Mark L. Lester's 'Commando' is the antithesis of the so-called 'chick flick', although it does contain a love story. This is a film about brute force and unbridled masculinity, and guns and grenades. Jolly good fun... if you like that sort of thing.",Commando
223,xenazues,What ever happen to action movies with one liners?,8,25 January 2017,"Probably one of the greatest action movies ever. And I mean it had everything you wanted in an action movie. Nudity, one liners, violence, and just a plot that really didn't make sense and didn't need to. And it was original from the stand point of just fight scenes alone. I mean this is probably one my favorite along with action jackson. Too many people nowadays just aren't funny. And the movie producers didn't want arnold to talk? What the heck is wrong with them?Arnold was great in this. He didn't say a lot but said enough. Hes whole one man wrecking crew was what the 80's action hero's were made off. And unlike the early 80's we didn't get any cheezy graphics messing it up. And the girl in this movie is amazing. Yeah shes corny as heck. Especially when shes in hotel screaming about macho man stuff. But its great. She doesn't come off like a bimbo. I heard they had a love scene in it. But I'm afraid that wouldn't have sold and I am not going to get into why. They director made a smart move by cutting that out.There we so many great characters in this movie. Bill Duke for one. Is there another better leaking mean guy than him? I do not think so. He played in the predator and this very well. He is also action jacksons captain in the movie. The man can play a hard ass all day and just nail it. So throwing him in your action movie is pretty much a no brainer. I'm in the national guard now and I saw a ton things that just wouldn't work. How he was firing those weapons with hand, how he's throwing grenades. But you know what it didn't matter, it was very great and you were waiting till he met the bad guy. Another thing I like about this movie is they don't wander from the script. There is no other side story period. Just him doing what it takes to get his daughter back. No going deeper into the general's life, nobody cares. They didn't explain matrix very well, they just mentioned he was ex army colonel and his daughter was taking by some guys in south America and he needs to get her back at all cost. Let's go!!Arnold has been in some great action movies. This one I felt was the best. I enjoyed terminator 1 and 2 and the running man, as well even the knew one The last stand but seriously just blow things up and show a few knife fighting scenes and I'm all good.",Commando

My two favorite zingers are when arnold drops that guy off the cliff and tells the girl he ""let him go"" and after shoving a steam pipe through some guys stomach he tells him to ""let off some steam"".

I'm going to disregard nostalgia of any kind: this film is the essence of what an action film should be about. Hardly any exposition, just good old-school, dynamic, enjoyable action. It's so refreshing to vicariously go back to a time when it was ok to not be pretentious and add an hour of freshman-year-philosophy when it's completely unnecessary. They tried to bring the spirit of the action film back in The Expendables, but ended up making a farce/parody, where all the actions stars of the past made fun of themselves. Commando was great, because all of the ridiculous one-liners and action scenes were delivered with utmost conviction. There is a number of great, ""serious"" films and Commando isn't one of them - it's supposed to be a FUN, feel-good movie. Schwarzenegger at his best.",Commando
227,DrLex,Plain silly fun,9,30 June 2006,"This is perfect entertainment. The plot is what a 6-year old could come up with, but it is adequate. Basically this is a ""villain kidnaps child of retired military guy, who then goes on quest to kick villain's ass"" movie. It's stuffed with one-liners and easy-to-digest humor. The action is nearly non-stop, with just enough time to recover after each action scene to tackle the next, even crazier scene. It has one of the highest body counts ever recorded in a movie, but villains either die at such ridiculously high rates or in such silly ways, that it remains funny.The reason why this movie works, is that it does not pretend to be serious at all, and dives head-on into an escalating cocktail of crazy action scenes. This is the kind of movie where you put your brain in stand-by, and settle yourself in your favorite chair with your favorite snack and beverage, for 90 minutes of total escapism. It is like a video game, but without you having to push any buttons to get rid of the enemies or make stuff explode.When watching this again after all those years, what strikes me is how well-crafted it is, especially compared to some recent productions. A mere glimpse at the number of stunt persons listed in the end credits gives an idea of how much effort was spent on the action scenes. Every scene shows evidence of having been meticulously planned on story boards, and no shaky cam was used to cut corners during execution. There is an eye for details everywhere, for instance even though it is implausible that Cindy had the time to read the manual for the rocket launcher, we do see the booklet in the shopping cart in the previous scene.If you crave for a psychological drama with complex character evolution, by all means do not watch this movie!

Film is interesting. Arnie skulks around dark corners trying to find out where she's gone. Film is tense. Then suddenly - apparently no crime is too criminal, no act too immoral, for Arnie to undertake to rescue said child. Film is ridiculous.Quite aside from the mass murder committed on an apocalyptic level, it is apparently perfectly okay to fire rockets at the police, ramraid an army surplus store, kidnap an innocent woman, steal her car, dispose of it when it's no longer useful and throw axes at people's heads, just as long as the one you love is still in danger.This would be the film's greatest problem, but actually that accolade must go to fellow commando Bennett's image in the whole affair - more flak-jacketed member of the Village People than vicious soldier, his appearance at any stage of the film is likely to remove your sense of guilt at enjoying the appalling macho theatrics which dominate it.Because it's all just a bit silly, really.",Commando

Matrix is retired, living in the middle of nowhere.Somehow, his whole team who have new identities, have been tracked down and killed (turns out it's Bennett with a new crew).The way in which they find him, says the dictator, is by killing Matrix' old crew so they could follow General Kirby to where he was. But Kirby flies in on a chopper to the middle of nowhere and they're already setup for the ambush. Whatever.After they get away with his daughter, they bundle him onto a plane to go assassinate the American-installed dictator. But he jumps out of the plane on takeoff, and so begins the ever so casual dismissal of real-world physics.Okay, I can accept gun blasts that send people flying like they just got tackled by a 120kg linebacker.

Commando is no Shakespeare no Action film is, but this one is so bad that other Action movies pale in comparison. However it's so bad that someone might actually like it. It's a bad Action film that you can see as a great Comedy! The battles are hilariously unrealistic, the machoism over the top even for a Arnie movie and logic was left the building a long time ago. The one-liners and the horrible acting can be quite funny in a B-movie kind of way like Sly's Cobra, (who is even better as a B-movie). If you expect something else though forget about this film.You'll hate Commando if: If you expect an Action film that isn't an insult to your brain cells and if you like Action heroes that use their brain instead of their raw power. Commando simply defies logic and you might say that all Action movies do, but Commando does it in such a bad way that it feels ridiculous. John Matrix is actually more powerful than the Terminator! He throws Phone Booths above his head, he throws a pipe through the body of a bad guy with perfect precision, throws blades like a machine, cutting body parts like butter and so on. Example of the lameness of the film: A woman helps Arnie to escape from a police armored car by hitting the car with a bazooka(!?!). Also in Commando you'll see exactly what a real commando would never do! I like Action movies where the hero is actually very, very smart like in Taken for example. Here Arnie plays a bid, dumb, crazy ape who shoots 100 soldiers uncovered, can't hide and does all kinds of crap that threaten the life of his daughter instead of keeping her safe. Besides these stuff the movie is very boring with long gunfights, badly choreographed brawls and the lamest actors you've seen in an Arnie movie and God the one-liners!

234,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,A classic pure action movie (SPOILERS),10,29 August 2007,"In the world of movies, there are some that are so bad they're good, meaning that no matter how stupid they seem, someone will manage to get some enjoyment out of them. 1985's ""Commando"", Arnold Schwarzenegger's first top billed film, is the single greatest example of that. The movie is so ridiculously over-the-top that I can't imagine anyone not having a smile on their face during every single scene.Some films, like ""Batman & Robin"" should be seen just once to experience how bad they are, but ""Commando"" never falls into that trap, being as fun the first time as it is the 100th. Why? The combination of dead-on performances, quick direction and pace, great action/fight scenes, hilarious one-liners, and Arnie's presence make the movie so fun that as soon as it ends, you'll want to see it again.No one coming to see these kind of movies expects a plot, and the filmmakers realize that, making it as simple as possible. Retired Colonel John Matrix (Arnie) just wants a simple life alone with his daughter Jenny (pronounced ""Chenny""). Unfortunately, General Arius, an exiled dictator from Val Verde, wants control of the (fictional) country again. Helping him is Bennett, a former soldier of Matrix who ""was thrown out of the unit"". Together, they unwisely decide to kidnap Chenny and use her as a hostage to get Matrix to kill the new leader of Val Verde. Naturally, Arnie finds a way around this and eventually gets to Arius and Bennett.While none of this is particularly complex, the way it all plays out is inventive and a blast to watch. Matrix is literally on his own and he has very little time to find Chenny, and this fact shows how tough and resourceful this guy is. Not to mention any bad guy that gets in his way, let it be Hendriques, Sully, Cooke or dozens of useless soldiers are easily disposed of with at least ten witty remarks. Arnie delivers his lines perfectly and his over exaggerated muscles lend to the image of Matrix or just about any character he's ever played.Vernon Wells brings a manic energy to Bennett, and the fact that this guy is pudgy, out of shape, and wears a chain mail vest throughout the whole film makes it difficult for anyone to take him seriously, but that makes him all the more awesome. Every henchman is clearly defined and gets a memorable send-off, but none more so than David Patrick Kelly as Sully. Rae Dawn Chong is the typical female sidekick, but after an awkward (to say the least!) introduction, she becomes important to the plot, helping Ahnuld in trying to save Jenny, played by Alyssa Milano, who brings a sweet innocence to the role.The musical score by James Horner is fantastic, giving the impression that our hero is lost in a kind of modern jungle. This is heightened by the fact that the music is heavily based on the rousing, raw-sounding main theme. The script is littered with instantly quotable lines, and to say any of them here would just ruin their effect in the finished film. Not only that, the movie is balanced nicely with light direction that calls for no morals to be addressed, just that we sit back and enjoy the fun of it all.It must however be noted that ""Commando"" is definitely for a niche audience. There are some glaring continuity errors/general goofs and I get the feeling that the people involved behind the scenes didn't intend for the movie to be as hilarious as it actually is. Aside from that, it's a breezy 90 minutes that just flies by and requires no thinking on the behalf of the audience. Other action films come and go, but none can quite reach the level of camp and fun that ""Commando"" inherently possesses. In the end, anyone watching this movie would come out thinking that they spent their time well on an excellent action romp. 10/10",Commando
235,kargaan,One of the Ultimate B movies,9,12 January 2011,Commando is a pure no holds barred straightforward action movie that doesn't mess around and gets right to the action from beginning to end. With a short run time and non-stop cheesy 80s fun why not go see this movie. Commando is no Terminator 2: Judgement Day but the movie gives you all you'd want from a corny 1980s action movie and more. It's also pretty memorable because of all the corny one-liners that Arnold spits out in almost every scene. It's a good action movie that will probably give you more than a few unintentional laughs. There's not much more that could really be said about it and right now i'm just making more lines so IMDb can let me submit it.,Commando
236,Maxta,"Dumb, but oh so good.",7,28 April 2001,"As you'll read in so many other reviews here, this movie is fantastic. Not for the plot (quite thin), not for the realism (Arnie vs Army) but for the sheer fun of it all. If you're in the least bit cynical you may not like this movie unless you can watch it through the eyes of a 14 yr old boy. The action is non-stop and the one-liners hilarious, one of Arnies best stupid films.

237,jimbofletch,"A very, very funny film!",6,8 January 2001,"Commando remains one of the most entertaining films of the 80's, and surely one of the funniest films ever made. Is its sheer awfulness done on purpose? Who knows? Commando is unofficially the most perfect spoof of the action genre, with all of the cliches thrown in. The script is either the best or worst ever written, depending heavily on your sense of irony. Another thing that you have to say about it is that it does not waste time. Ten minutes in and John Matrix (Arnie Schwarzenegger)is already thrown into a dastardly plot of kidnap, murder, the usual. Matrix may be an amazingly dull character, but the pleasures of Commando lie in the villains. Colonel Bennett is a rampantly flamboyant, slightly porky henchman with a silly moustache who delivers lines with such OTT relish you figure the actor must be having the time of his life. The other lackeys, such as Sully (who falls prey to one of the finest deaths seen on film), Cooke (played by some-time director Bill Duke)and the doomed Henriques, are amusingly colourful characters, all killed off way too quickly. Most of the enjoyment in the film is unintentional. For one thing, it is, technically, one of the worst films ever. Easily visible springboards hurling soldiers into the air, or safety strings holding up Sully when Matrix is holding him over the hillside, blatantly fake soldiers in the explosion scenes, continuity errors everywhere. It's best just to enjoy it. As for the one-liners, they are all classics (""I let him go"", ""Let off some steam"", ""Don't disturb my friend, he's dead tired""), and the final raid on Arius' lair is one of the most stupid sequences of all time, as Matrix destroys an entire army with the blink of an eye.

Criticially misunderstood at the time of its release, it was nevertheless an enormous popular success, and propelled Schwartzenegger squarely into the Quigley's Top Ten Moneymaker's poll (#6) for the first time.Commando eludes simple analysis; it is a masterful melding of excess and economy. Ostensibly an action thriller, Commando defies simple categorization and succeeds largely on the strength of its own brazen self-confidence.Whatever one's opinion of this controversial film, one thing is certain: Commando will continue to entertain and beguile audiences for generations to come.",Commando

Commando is cinematic excellence. This is as good as it gets. I can think of no other movie that brings such joy to me as Commando. Everything is top notch. Schwarzenegger has never been better as he is here as John Matrix.John Matrix takes on an army. And he wins. That is so cool. These bad guys decide to do something stupid and kidnap Matrix's daughter. Big mistake. By movies end, all of them will be dead. The coolest sequence I have ever seen in a movie is the thirty minutes of Schwarzenegger storming the renegade army's compound. The guy kills fifty people and not just with guns either.I'm dead serious when I give this movie my highest praise. This is what movies are all about. Go watch Commando and I dare you not to like it.

In true 80's action fashion while the opening credits are still rolling, our lead character is developed, his love for his daughter is portrayed and the plot is revealed. No need for 30-60 mins of soppy character building we get nowadays, instead we get plummeted into the action and all you can say is WOW!When Matrix's daughter Jenny Matrix (Alyssa Milano) gets kidnapped we are brought on a non-stop roller-coaster of action, one-liners, cheese, testosterone, super-human abilities, more action, more one-liners and more cheese, as he wipes out an entire army to try and save his daughter from the clutches of the evil dictator (well a former dictator with ambitions of being one again) Arius (Dan Hedaya).Along the way he has a check-list of bad guys like end of level bosses Bennett (Vernon Wells), Sully (David Patrick Kelly), Cooke (Bill Duke) and Henriques (Charles Meshack).This film doesn't pretend to be anything else, not taking itself serious it is what it is, a cheesy action flick with a body count of the highest order and it does it perfectly. Arnold Schwarzenegger does an excellent job and is the best fit for this film, looks the part and can pull off the one-liners better than anybody. The villains are all cast brilliantly, stand-outs Vernon Wells still in his Mad Max gear plays the twisted Bennett who loves and hates John Matrix. Smart mouthed, deviant Sully (David Patrick Kelly) is the set up for a bunch of one-liners and John Matrix's love interest? (not sure if that's what she is, but she is there anyway) Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong). We even get a Bill Paxton snippet.The plot is simple but works perfectly. The action is top notch full of guns, explosions, knives, neck snapping and destruction. The only negative is that we didn't get more Commando films.A cheesy moment to look out for, the whole film: more one-liners than you can count, cheesy action coming out of your ears and if you look closely you'll see the same bad-guy extras getting killed multiple times. My personal favourite cheese moment is when he drops from the plane into the marsh and checks his watch and you hear the seconds beeping away, sometimes it's the small things.Note: To fully enjoy this film make sure you watch the full edition, so many versions going around that are cut and chopped to bits, and missing small but quality moments.

Is this a groundbreaking, soul drenching motion picture masterpiece? NO! This is a straight up 80's action movie, full of the cheesiest one liners that cracks me up every time I watch it...and I LOVE it! Arnold is fantastic in this over the top action film that you can feel is trying to be somewhat serious but just can't get there due to the one liners and the directors use of making Arnold seem like a real live ''HE MAN''. Everything our hero does and says in this movie is so funny as Arnold delivers it with such deadpan humour that you as the viewer can tell is really unintentional. This really is such a classic in the action genre that I feel to this day has not been replicated. It's the sort of movie where your hero has 1000 bullets flying at him and not one hits. And because it's Arnold it just makes sense. It truly is an action masterpiece and I feel worthy of a top 3 spot in the 80's action genre.",Commando

Nobody hurts him too much and the law of gravity doesn't influence him. But, if I watched it carefully in these days, it means a lot. Arnold is really great, and the movie cannot disappoint you.I did not understand why Arnold dragged that woman with him.

It need not have been the most subtle and the most realistic movie but it did deliver what an action fan needed from start to finish.

Before all of the parities like Hot Shots, etc. this movie would not have been so absurd, but it had ever cliché in the book, and made you think of them. Also, the one liners were everywhere and well spaced. Lots of decent action, decent car chases, but the end fight where Arnold is mowing down people was insane. Rae Dawn Chung going along with everything was not believable, and of course she happened to know how to fly a plane? We must not forget that they had to have an excuse to show Arnolds muscles, so on those lines, they didn't use the ripped shirt technique as they usually do with Bruce and Stallone movies, but figured out ways to pull his shirt off altogether. The rowing boat scene had me laughing. Could they have not done that whole scene in a less corny way? Every time Arnold was shot or whatever, he was fine 30 seconds later. One interesting note was that Alyssa Milano was like 15 in this movie but made up to be 12. Guess it would not have worked otherwise. I could pick this movie apart, scene by scene...but I will stop.

248,sati_84,An absolute classic (mild SPOILERS),7,17 November 2004,"This movie has a very complicated plot. The story is about a retired philosopher, John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who is currently living a pleasant life with his daughter. One day, Albert Einstein comes along and opens a wormhole into the year 1999 (they were in 1985 before). Matrix and his daughter then watches a movie, from that year, which is called ""The Matrix"". And from now on, the movie shows us their philosophical discussion about the main question: ""What is the Matrix?""OK, just kidding. Philosophy isn't involved in this movie at all, nor Albert Einstein, and the only discussion between Matrix and his daughter is about Boy George's gender...The plot is simple: the bad guys are kidnapping Matrix's daughter and Arnie kills every single one of them himself. Some of them are getting impaled, some of them are simply gunned down by the hero. In today's movies, heroes trying to outsmart the baddies, but Arnold has a better idea: he decides, he would rather go on a killing spree, and so the fun begins. Explosions, guns, guns, guns, hand grenades, guns, guns, machine guns, guns, guns, a bulldozer, guns, guns, a rocket launcher, guns, guns, guns and even a fork comes into play.WARNING!!! Do not expect plot twists or mind-bending conclusions! It's not ""The Sixth sense"" or anything like that. It's an Arnold movie, but not a ""Total recall"". It hasn't got any political, moral or whatever lesson to teach the audience, it has mindless action and unbelievably corny one-liners.There's one scene in the movie, when one of the bad guys explains the situation to Arnie: he must cooperate, because they have his daughter. Nowadays, an action movie hero would drop his gun and cooperate. But hey, this movie was made in 1985, so Arnold's reply cannot be anything else than shooting the guy in the face... One of the most memorable moments in this movie (for me) is when Arnie is single-handedly shooting with a machine gun. In Counter-Strike, your character can barely WALK with that gun, but in the movie, Arnie is jumping, crouching and running with it. Amazing! This is why he doesn't appear in this movie as a brain surgeon...These are the reasons, why you have to check your brain at the door, sit back and relax. Enjoy the movie, because it's fun!!!And in case I didn't mention it before, this is a classic...7/10",Commando

Schwarzenegger obliterates everything that gets in his path on his way to attempting to rescue his kidnapped daughter. Any film that has the main character causally carrying a tree trunk on his shoulder, and then feeding deer within the first minutes you know that you are in for a classic Arnie film. I would say this is definitely a boys film, lots of guns, grenades, rocket launchers, some of the best one liners in any of Arnolds films. The film has since gained a cult status over the years, but at the time of release it was considered to be a lot more serious a film then the way it is viewed now. The film is littered with plot holes and ridiculous scenarios of one man against every one else, however that is also part of its charm.

You can't take this movie serious for a second. The story is so stupid, but still so incredibly cool. I absolutely love it. It's hard to imagine that this is the same director that made the shitfest Pteradactyl. But on the other hand, I can understand it, because this is simply just accidental genius.This movie is completely ridiculous from the very beginning. I dare say this is my favorite Arnold movie out of the so-bad-its-good movies he made. I also think this is the movie where he looks the most beef. This is Arnold in his younger years, before he made it really big in Hollywood. He looks really pumped up. This is from the years after he stopped his bodybuilding career. And it really shows in Commando. In the actions scenes he fights without a shirt, makes me really question my sexuality. The acting is absolutely horrible and the bad lines don't make it any better. This is the 80's at its best.This is a great action movie. Grab some beers and snacks and watch this with your friends.",Commando
251,Velociraptor256,One of the best action movies ever,10,8 September 2010,"Commando is not a deep or thought-provoking film, and very few would call it one of the greatest movies of all time. Yet it doesn't feel right to give it anything other than a 10-star rating: it is a solid, incredibly entertaining film and I can't think of anything I would change about it.Perhaps the secret is simplicity: John Matrix's daughter is kidnapped by some guys who want him to assassinate a president for them, but unlike in other action movies involving blackmail, he doesn't even consider doing what they want and just starts following a trail of henchmen to find where his daughter is being held. That's all there is to it. And with such a simple concept, there's not much that can go wrong with it. The whole thing is compact and consistent, with brilliantly executed fight scenes, shootouts and more all the way through. Sure, there are nonsensical things like Matrix jumping out of a plane as it takes off, or using a bulldozer to break into a shop, but somehow their silliness doesn't matter: they just add to the entertainment value.John Matrix, as played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is close to perfection as action heroes go: he's an uncompromising bad-ass with insane killing skills and too many brilliant one-liners to list here - Arnold is in his element in this film. The main villain, Bennett (Vernon Wells), is beautifully over-the-top. Some viewers might not like Matrix's sidekick, Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), but I found her funny without being annoying, and she even gets to be surprisingly helpful.Commando is just a pure and simple action movie, without trying to be anything else, and on that level, it delivers absolutely superbly.",Commando

However there are plenty of hilarious moments and corny one-liners during this movie which are basically the best bits about it. (**Spoiler Alert**) - The scene where the General leaves two soldiers to guard Arnie and his daughter was totally hilarious!

The raw machismo, coupled with laughable dialogue, poor acting, one liners, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and more bullet dodging than The Matrix, it's a one-stop-shop action cinema education.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as John Matrix, the ultimate killing machine who never forgets to throw in a one liner with a kill. His quest to rescue his daughter (a young Alyssa Milano) takes him through Los Angeles with a trail of bodies in his wake. His villains are South American rebels and a rogue from his elite unit with an impressive/concerning moustache.One cannot really spend a great deal of time talking about the technical merits of the film- beside the achievement of frequently fitting Arnold Schwarzenegger's entire body in the shot. Everything functions like a film. And it's not meant to be high art. But as Die Hard came out a mere 3 years later, showing an action movie can be awesome and be technically proficient, with great acting and dialogue, it cannot in good conscious get a pass. The score is representative of it redeeming itself by being hilarious. Genuinely, this might be the funniest action film ever. Without how fun it is, this would be sitting at the bottom of the barrel.Just for some examples of the beauty/horror juxtaposition of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger is introduced topless, with a tree in one hand and a chainsaw in the other, the peak of Macho. This is next followed with a montage of his relationship with his daughter, feeding a deer and catching fish. It cannot, hopefully intentionally, be taken seriously. The dialogue in the first 10-20 minutes is pure bad exposition, and half of the action lacks any real tension when there seems to be a forcefield around John Matrix.The lines are legendary, the film might as well have its roots tattooed on its rippling bulging arm muscle, and you will have a blast watching it.

Spend the rest of the film killing terrorists, blowing stuff up and spouting some of the best one liners ever. Of Course!

The action sequences are put together nicely as well.And as ever, we get a heavy dose of un-real events. Arnold and his new friend acquire a heavy stash of guns from a gun shop, managing to fit a 4 square-barrelled rocket launcher, machine guns, ammo, hand guns, shotguns, grenades, C4 and more in a few duffel bags. Of course, he gets caught! His one liners are funny as well. however, they are funny because there so stupid! But its not just him, his friend, a woman he met, is on blob with lines like ""I've only known you 10 minutes, and already I want to kill you."" The gun fights are what make this movie. They've been well shot, and show Arnie in his prime, flexing his biceps and taking gun shot wounds whilst still fighting.

They rammed their fist through Columbian drug dealers faces. But Gay? This was a hard teaching. Who could accept it? But after many years of maturation and much prayer time, I've come to accept these out of the closet warriors for who they are. And Commando, thou are the gayest of them all.

The president wants Arnolds character John Matrix(Typical tacky action hero name.) to kill the current president so he can return to power. But John Matrix doesn't cooperate and he finds the island they have taken her to and he kills pretty much everyone there and rescues her. The acting is very dry but we have come to expect that from Arnold through out his career.

You can't get away with films like this now as it's too cheesy and riddled with continuity flaws. But it's of it's time so you can forgive.

Why? Because it's a comedy of course, and beats so-called action comedy spoofs films like 'Hot Shots' hands down.What everyone involved in the making this cheese-fest was thinking, God only knows, but everything about it is SO wrong that it turns out SO right.  Poor story, poor script, poor acting, poor effects -  you name it, Commando's probably got a grade F in it.  In fact, after my first viewing I was so amazed by its naffness that that I rewound it and watched it again.",Commando

266,KillMe666,"""...you'll cooperate, right?""........""WRONG!""",10,12 August 2001,"Arnold - the action movie king of the eighties!This film is the greatest and most enjoyable action movie ever made, yes it may lack brains but who the hell cares? It's a movie with Schwarzenegger and has the title - ""Commando"", what do you people want? Mental stimuli? Thought provoking drama? Intricate plots? Pah! Arnold wipes his butt with such phrases.Arnie plays the retired commando of the title who is forced to wear his cammo's again when his daughter is kidnapped by the stereotypical bad guys as a blackmail - he must kill the U.S. president or they will kill his little girl. Obviously Arnold isn't going to stand for this kind of nonsense so he escapes from the plane they put him on after killing the male chaperon and begins the hunt, gaining assistance from Rae Dawn Chong along the way.Although a complete testosterone-fest from start to finish this film has a comedic side (though nearly totally engulfed by the action), which gives it a certain (good ole 80s) charm, that means if you like the film you will watch it again and again, and perhaps a third time.It has many classic lines from the big man, for example; before the 'bads' put him on the plane, he retorts to one of them who makes sly comment about his daughter - ""Your a funny guy Sully, I like you - that's why I'm gonna kill you last!"". After killing the baddie on the plane he says to a stewardess - ""Don't disturb my friend, he's DEAD tired!""My favourite is when another baddie - Cooke (although his buddy in 'Predator') is brawling with Arnie and manages to pick up a large revolver, which he points at Arnie and says - ""F*** you Ass****!"", he pulls the trigger but the gun is empty so Arnie retorts - ""F*** YOU Ass****!"" and smacks him one!My review may be biased as I think Arnie is the man (before his decline into utterly abysmal movies that is), but still, if you want to see a one-man-army in action, then see Commando.",Commando

269,Hannibal_Chigurh,Big Dumb Fun,7,27 October 2007,"Commando is perhaps the most over-the-top film Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made, and that's no small feat. The bare bones plot involves retired Special Ops Colonel John Matrix whose daughter is kidnapped by a South American tyrant who Matrix deposed. The president's main thug is one of John's former squadmates, Bennett. They put Matrix on a jet bound for the president's country to assassinate the current leader. Of course, Arnold manages to escape and it's a race against time to get his daughter back before they realize the plan's gone wrong.Along the way, Matrix recruits a random lady, Cindy, to help him. She serves no purpose except for a few scenes. At least they didn't make a romance out of it. Arnold mixes his standard action fare with Bond-like one-liners, which works in some places and fails in others.The action here is incredible. Arnold takes on the tyrant's private army single-handedly. It's not quite as ridiculous as Rambo battling the Viet Cong all by his lonesome, but it's still beyond far-fetched. Explosions and bullets fill the screen for the last 20 minutes, and it's some of the best action you'll ever see. However, this doesn't excuse the mercilessly slow opening third of the film. A film like this doesn't need that much time to establish the story and get things really rolling. The first two Terminators blend action with story much better than any other flick Arnold's been in, and the action in those films is better too. Still, if you're in the mood for a mindless shooter. Look no further.",Commando

What i'm trying to get to is that if you're intending to watch Commando you should know what you're in for: awesome cinematic 80's action! This movie is simply a classic, it may the most generic action movie out there but that's why it's so good. This is the type of film that has bad editing, a generic plot and very VERY cheesy one lines. But you know what? it doesn't' matter! you know you don't care about that (and if you did care why on earth do you want to watch an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?) and all you want to see is Arnie shooting everyone Rambo style while screaming I'LL BE BACKKK!

Arnie with his one-liners are soooo funny. The way and how he says them are just fabulous and just a Laugh Out Loud thing. I would like to credit James Horner (the composer of this film) for his work on the music score on this film it's just a terrific score to me anyways but other people have different opinions. How can shrubs and bushes protect Arnie from the bullets of the other soldiers? Hmm me thinks it would be a mistake of course. Bill Duke should of got a much larger role in this movie because seeing him on film is just fantastic (considering he had such a small role) his fight with Matrix is cool and getting to see other peoples business is so funny.Rated R18+ for Aussies for Violence, Language and a little bit of Gore",Commando
274,Andy C-2,Truly awful,3,4 December 2001,"This film is absolutely terrible. After watching this film I trying to think what the worst films I've ever seen, and this compares. I struggle to see how anyone over the age over about 8, could enjoy this stereo-typed riden, amazingly predictable, macho b******t. Arnie is in good form, ie he's poor, rather than appalling. I can't remember the specifics of the story line. But it runs something like this: Arnie is ex-commando, his kid is nicked to try to make him join evil gang, he re-captures her, whilst breaking every law in human history and everyone lived happily ever after. Arnie frequently seems more evil than the enemy, he persistently shots and kills people for the sake of it, jumps through glass- when he could open the door, as well as seeming to be protected by some sort of protective shield which prevents him through injury or being killed (although this isn't explained at any time). As per usual the security guards and trained killers have worse accuracy than a five year old girl with there guns, Arnie shows off his muscle for no logical reason, a female member of the public decides to believe his messed up story, despite the number of people he massacres. Every cliche is obeyed and Arnie assassinates more people than the number of casulties in WWII. I could go on all day, but I don't have time. Watch this film.",Commando
275,tony-howe,One hell of a good movie,8,8 November 2006,"This is my favourite action movie of all time. Who cares if it's not a ""great"" film? It does everything a good action film should.

I can watch this film over and over again, without getting the slightest bit bored. If only all action films were crafted this well. What a shame that Arnie started making all those terrible family orientated movies and awful comedies - this shows him at his best.If you want to stay in for an evening with a couple of mates, drink some beer and have a laugh, then there is no better movie to put on than this.",Commando
276,watcherDH,A Genre Classic,6,2 December 2005,"The good old 80's action movies....Extremely muscular hero, an evil villain and 10,000 evil cloned Mexican soldiers waiting to get shot. No questions asked.Remember the old heroes of those days? Arnold Schwarzenegger, Silvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal are the best known of those action heroes. Of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the most famous of them all because he got a shot at some really big movies (Terminator 1 and 2, Predator) which were of good quality.This however is the genre in which Arnold Schwarzenegger truly excelled, not so much because of his action physique but because of him adding a certain (intended?) touch of self-humor in his films. That gives them that extra something that other action films of those days lack.Commando is arguably the most typical 80's action movie of them all. The plot is as thin as a dog's hair, but here it is: Ex-commando John Matrix (Arnold) sees his daughter being kidnapped by an evil ex-dictator of a central-American country and vows revenge on said ex-dictator.That's all there is to the plot.The action is ludicrous in this movie, but we wouldn't expect any less from Arnold, would we? (back then, nowadays it's a different story) Expect to see enough explosions to move a small planet from it's orbit, more bullets being fired than in both world wars put together and a twisted dictator's henchman (Vernon Wells) so camp he's well, camp.The verdict: Massively entertaining, not only because of the action but also because of the enormous comedy value this movie has built up over the years. Expect a laugh or two, or three, or thirteen. Brilliant one liners, finally, make this movie what it is: a genre classic. It's still a bad film, but for old times' sake: 6 out of 10.",Commando

Lots of guns, lots of death, lots of blood, a yellow Porsche 911, a great cast of characters, an excellent story and setting... and of course the ultimate protagonist/antagonist rivalry make Commando a classic 80's action film. Arnold, in his prime in my opinion, does a great job as Matrix, an ex-military man now trying to lead a peaceful civilian life. However, Vernon Wells deserves a damn Oscar for his performance as the villain, Bennett. He's a leather-pants and chain-mail vest wearing mercenary with a bad haircut and porn-star mustache who wants to kill Matrix so badly, that he staged his own death in order to have everyone drop their guard before all hell breaks loose! The fight scene in the mall with the cops and the final battle between Matrix and Bennett are classic. Finally, the music supplied by The Power Station band, deserves recognition. Simply one of the best over-the-top, action packed, take-no-prisoners, no retreat-no surrender, blood-&-guts, death and destruction films of all time.",Commando

If he doesn't kill a South American dictator in a small amount of time, they'll kill his daughter. Please? All this for a god damn assassination? At least make the plot believable. Doesn't have to be realistic, but DOES have to be believable. How Arnold Schwarzenegger got into acting, is beyond me.

This movie has it all, including hilarious one-liners, cheesy and unrealistic action, and Arnold's charisma at its best. Not only did Arnold take out an entire militia on his own, but he also got hit by a car, had no whip lash from a car accident, and he used a banner to flawlessly swing all the way from the top floor of a 2-3 story shopping mall to the bottom like Tarzan. He flips over a phone booth with someone in it, pulls a kayak onto a beach in a speedo, and somehow gets a wild deer to eat out of his hand with his daughter next to him. I'm telling you, this movie is classic. It's so cheesy but funny and entertaining. I'm surprised at how low the IMDb rating is on a scale of 1 to 10. I mean, let's be honest, it wasn't getting an Oscar nomination. The target audience is men who want to be entertained. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Arnold and 80s action movies.I'm ashamed to say I didn't see this movie until 2002-2003 but I've been a lifelong Arnold fan.

281,robybaggio18,"Simple, direct and fun",7,14 August 2012,"There isn't much one can say about this movie since it is far from complicated. It starts quickly, has a very clear goal and scores on time and in style. I don't think there is another movie which evolves around the main character as much as ""Commando"" does. John Matrix is an invincible one man army who kills every bad guy that comes along the way. He kills them because they kidnapped his daughter. Matrix is like a tornado that sweeps across the country and leaves nothing intact. Throw in a few memorable one-liners, a hilarious villain and several very uncensored methods of annihilating opponents - a classic is born!Liam Neeson's ""Taken"" has used a similar formula a few years ago and again it was very effective. Now and then cinema needs such a simple and honest action flick without even a hint of apology. It's a guilty pleasure, both of them are.I give it 8/10 not because it is high quality, I give it because it knows what it wants to be and it does that flawlessly.",Commando

Commando is Arnie in his rawest form. The opening scene shows him lifting an entire tree on his shoulders for Christ's sake! The death count for this movie is approximately 250, which is just about right. The actions scenes don't seem cheesy though, as opposed to some of the Rambo films.

Violent action,basic plot and some funny one-liners make this entertaining. It's also entertaining because it looks like it was made with a paper thin budget. Tacky sets, craptastic acting and more than enough unbeliveability to make watching this a fun way to kill 90 minutes.No other film I've seen shout out ""This is 1985"" better than this. It has less of a cliché based formula which helps. The one important thing to link it all together is the one and only Schwarzeneger. He is basically a pysical fitness message. In this film he has his shirt off for 80% of the film and makes his stunts look credible because you can tell that nobody else helps him through it. Give it a view. A good time is ahead, but don't expect to view anything to rave about. But Rae Dawn Chong will make it come close!",Commando
284,kareem-1,The Beauty of Bad 80's Action,8,23 May 2005,"Tonight, I sat at home after a long and outright draining day, and while scrolling through DirecTV's paltry choices for viewing I stumbled upon wonderful, Commando. Now if you know anything about my other comments I placed on IMDb you know I am an 80's brat, born in 1976 the eighties where my most educational time, simply because of movies like this. Ahhhnold, Rae Dawn (still have a crush on her), Dan Hedeya, and 80's teen goddess (come on you can admit you had a crush on her too) Alyssa Milano.You find yourself repeating poorly scripted lines, and imitating the governor's strange body motions as if you are auditioning for the part of Guerilla soldier #38 yourself. Here is a movie filled with the good 80's themes of mild sexual tension, good guy bullet dodger, and tons of explosive material. You even notice (20 years later) that buildings that had nothing to do with explosions where blown to bits.For some reason this movie ended up in my fathers VHS collection along with A Color Purple, Scarface and Beverly Hills Cop. None of which could hope to hold a candle to it in the Moldy Cheese category. Movies like Commando where obviously made to perpetuate the Stallone vs. Schwarzenegger water cooler / locker room talk, unfortunately it never did live up the sheer growl of First Blood or any thing else in the Rambo franchise (ok maybe not Rambo 3, Milano's abduction is a whole lot more enjoyable to watch than Richard Crenna's). The film takes you through a winding road a fight/ punch montages and the always-entertaining punch lines that seem to punctuate nearly every line Arnold speaks. From the overtly visible stunt people to the Shatneresque acting when Arnold peels his vest off during the climactic invasion scene this is a movie for the annals of time right along side Easy Money.",Commando
285,moviefan-85,One of the Best Schwarzenegger films ever!,9,27 February 2004,"I remember when i was 7 years old and I saw this masterpiece. This was one of the first arnie movies I saw at that time. I still love this movie 9 years later. The movie was made when Arnies career was growing bigger and bigger. Previously he made his all time best movie Terminator which was a critical and commercial hit. There is no very good plot, but the movie rocks.Its funny and its entertaining. It has Arnies legendary one liner "" I´ll be back"" and a lot of other good lines. (WARNING STORY SPOILERS:) The story is: Arnold is ex commando soldier who is living with his daughter. Bad Guys kidnap his daughter and send him to kill President of Val Verde, but Arnold has his own plans. So he starts to kill everybody in order to find out where is his dauhgter. I will not spoil anything but the movies showdown is amazing. The movie is unrealistic but still good. The movie had some sensorship problems In Sweden and they cut 15 minutes of it which is a lot because isnt so raw. Of cource it has couple of brutal moments, ( Arnie cuts a soldiers hand)but they are part of Arnie humour. The movie has a lot of humour and its just a plus. I can watch this movie hundred times and still I would not be bored. Steven E De Souza did the script ( Die Hard1-2, 48 HRS.) so this cant be bad. After release De souza wrote the sequel but Arnold wasnt interested and Joel Silver had other projects, so he just changed to Die Hard. Sometimes I think that what kind a sequel it would be. Next to Terminator1-2 and Predator this is his best. I love this movie and so should you!Buy it or watch it",Commando
286,Skruffbagg,Action? This should be your only choice,10,1 July 2015,"I'll be the first to admit that it's difficult to maintain one's critical faculties when talking about a movie that essentially defined a million childhoods, but seriously? Commando is the finest action movie ever made.Arnie is Colonel John Matrix, ex-Delta Force/CIA Black Ops. Now living retired in the mountains with his cute daughter, chopping wood and wearing pastel colours. He learns from his superior officer that someone has been killing his former squad members, and that a couple of disposable soldiers will be left behind to make sure he's OK. Needless to say this is when all hell breaks loose and his daughter is kidnapped by mercs lead by Bennet, an ex-member of Matrix's team expelled for his ""methods"". Matrix is captured and blackmailed into assassinating the new President of fictional Val Verde by the former despot Arius. He escapes custody while boarding a flight, and now has just over 10hrs before they discover he wasn't on board and kill his daughter.What follows is delightful, overblown macho craziness. The script and screenplay, while not exactly winning any awards, are perfect. It has everything. gun fights, knife fights, fist fights, car chases, explosions and rocket launchers. The film is full of fantastic one-liners delivered spectacularly by Schwarzenegger - at his absolute best here - and Rae Dawn Chong is excellent as his reluctant assistant. The seriousness of it all is undercut with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour showing that the actors know how ridiculous it all is, and even remark upon it in one scene. The bad guys are brilliantly played by the immortal Bill Duke, David Patrick Kelly and Vernon Wells, among others. I am almost certain that Vernon Wells portrayal of Bennet is responsible for the homosexual awakening of many a young boy in the 80s political climate of Reagan America.This movie is super violent. A lot of people die. A lot. Nearly as many simply just get the crap beaten out of them. There's a scene where Arnold throws around 8 guys lying on top of him flying 10 foot through the air! I mean that is awesome. Imitated many years later in The Matrix (uhhhh.....) Reloaded, but in crappy CGI. The end of the movie is absolutely insane, with Matrix going alone up against a literal army. Cue massive explosions, gunfire and (hilariously fake) bodies. What keeps this crazy 4 minutes so entertaining is not just the amount of people that die, but also the inventive ways in which Matrix dispatches his foes, using various tools out of a shed at one point.Really, this review is just pandering to any kid who grew up in the 80s and loved action movies. They will never be the same as they were then, and this is the absolute apex of the genre.If you want drama, emotion and exposition, look elsewhere. This it ain't. If you want awesome action and killer one-liners along with the greatest star to ever hold an M16, This should be your only choice.",Commando

Everyone thinks Conan and Terminator are his most remembered roles but think about it, what do you expect from an Arnie film? Arnold the Action Hero! (That's basically the guy who's in Raw Deal, True Lies, Eraser, Total Recall, Predator etc). The kick ass action hero with the killer one liners, and this is his debut film.Commando is the most streamlined Hyper Action film of all time. Arnold is Matrix, a retired Commando. He likes to spend his days feeding dears and eating Ice Cream with his daughter in his little cabin in the woods. But all this changes when some evil South Americans helped by Bennit, an ex-member of Matrix's Commando unit who looks like Freddie Mercury on steroids, kidnap his daughter and force him to go on an assignment to Kill the President of a fictional South American country, Val Verdi.Well when you do things like that to Matrix, clearly the hardest man alive, that makes him mad and when He gets mad people DIE and things BLOW UP! Matrix decides not to assassinate the President of Val Verdi but instead track down his daughters kidnappers withing an 11 hour time limit. Helped by his female sidekick, Thankfully not his love interest (See how streamlined it really is?).The most memorable bit is of coarse the final showdown, which has to be the finest of it's type. Watch Matrix as he mows down at least 100 bad moustached guys in the space of 15 minutes. Then boils down to the one on one match with Bennit.Commando is directed by Mark L.

Don't know if it was due to the fact that you could count the total number of available movies on your fingers or only because almost all the boys there were familiar with Commando.Since then, I had the chance to see it a couple of times more, mainly on TV, and haven't changed my mind. Yes, you have some scenes that could be considered as amateurish, like the one when Matrix is jumping from the plane in that swamp and he starts to run completely dried!

It is just brainless from beginning to end... and THAT'S why it's so great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his best when he's playing unstoppable killing machines and blowing the Hell out of anything that moves. The story is that John Matrix's daughter is kidnapped by terrorists because they want Matrix to assassinate the president of Val Verde. But instead of cooperating, Matrix goes on a mission to rescue his daughter and stop the bad guys. From there we get plenty of explosions, gunfire, and one-liners. Acting isn't half bad but what matters is the way they are preformed. Vernon Wells is one the craziest villains ever put on films and he delivers his acting in a glorious, hammy, over-the-top, way. There are a lot of silly clichés but you don't laugh at them, you laugh with them. Plenty of great lines to hold you over and the final action scene is one the best ever.

The Acting is unique because of the villain Bennett (Wells) is so intent of being the better man with his acting being superb.The movie starts out with Cooke (Bill Duke) killing off random people in the first 5 minutes, later to be John Matrix's (Arnie) ex Commando friends. Matrix and his daughter (Milano) are living out a normal life in the forest near a small village, within minutes of a normal morning Martix's life is turned upside down and inside out when the only thing worth living for is kidnapped, his daughter. Matrix has no choice but to co-operate with a South American dictator (Heyada) to kill a president, if he co-operates, he will save his daughter from death, if he doesn't she will be chopped up and sent to him in the mail. But what they didn't know is that Matrix has a third choice, Go Commando! and kill every person involved and save his daughter.What really made this movie special for me is when Matrix puts on is army uniform and stocks up with his weapons on the island and stands their like he is king of the world, it sent shivers up my spine.With great one-liners, humour, action, and plot, this is an all round great action flick.9/10",Commando
294,tachyon_1,Classic Arnold.,7,5 January 2007,"This is classic Arnold. Not teaching Kindergarten, not having a baby, but just pure non-stop butt kicking action.I always enjoy watching this movie. Not because it's great cinema or anything. I know it's no Citizen Kane of course, but it's a blast to watch. Arnold's character, Matrix, is great. He just keeps on going, unstoppable. Like the bastard child of the Terminator and the Energizer bunny. He doesn't pause, he doesn't negotiate, or discuss or beg. He just takes immediate action in every situation, without question or without fear. This is what makes the movie worth watching. That and the famous one-liners of course.It's also nice to see Alyssa Milano back when she was still an innocent little girl instead of like she is now. If you are an action fan and you haven't seen this movie, then I spit on you. Go rent it now and get out of my sight until you've seen it and you are worthy. ;')",Commando

Movie moves fast, has a couple good action sequences (all early), and as early era Arnie B-movie fits the bill. But the cheapness is obvious in a few spot, there are a ton of plot holes and the big shootout at the end is so ridiculous and goes on so long that it actually gets kind of boring (though the round blade tossing is pretty epic).

298,fieldimdb,The greatest example of an action film,10,22 April 2019,"What's great about Commando is that it grabs the viewer from reel one and doesn't let go for less than ninety minutes. Three men are killed before the opening credits. The first is machine gunned by two hit men disguised as waste collectors, the second a car sales man is driven through the window of his show room and the third is blown up on a boat. Enter the next intended victim, Arnold Schwarzenegger to James Horner's mystical music. This guy personifies cool and he is the strongest man you ever saw. The bad guys will realize one thing after the film, they picked on the wrong man. But did they not know that already? For this guy can carry an entire tree over one shoulder without stopping to catch a breath and he can take on an army of a hundred with a sub machine gun. And that they kidnap his daughter and force him to kill a president, they are stirring things. For Arnold is angry. He doesn't bargain with the bad guys, he kills them. You have to cooperate, right? says Arnold's first victim. Wrong replies Arnold and he shoots the bad guy in the head. That's the kind of film Commando is, pure kick ass entertainment with a body count of well over a hundred. The greatest action film ever made? Certainly the most direct.",Commando

301,cpheonix,This isn't one of Arnie's best films? Wrong.,9,7 February 2003,"Having watched this film again, it brought back memories of how enjoyable and funny it is. Ok, so it's unbelievable and the dialogue is littered with cliches, but the cliches are funny and the characters are so comic-book that it goes well with film.I mean, this must be the film where Arnie has the most one-liners and kills the most people (undisputedly). The end scene where he mows down endless South Americans (who, on closer inspection are the same 10 extras with just different facial hair everytime) is priceless.  Arnie strolls onto a garden lawn with guys shooting all around him who *somehow* manages to hit the leaves on the plants and missing him completely. Arnie throws a grenade 10 feet away from some soldiers, and they blow up sky-high. Grenade gets thrown right at Arnie's feet, and he gets a little graze on his stomach! But it's all good fun...Arnie's complimented well by the energy of Rae Dawn Chong and the bad guy Bennett, who makes us believe he can beat Matrix with his stick-on moustache, chain-mail vest and beer gut! Also Alyssa Milano makes a great appearance as Arnie's daughter.I definitely recommend this film for some quality entertainment - easy viewing and not much thought needed (what do you expect for a Schwarznegger film?). Just remember the one-liners: 'I lied', 'he's dead tired', 'let off some steam'...trust me, it will have you in stitches.",Commando
302,james-laing,Satire is the name of the game.,10,17 June 2011,"Oh what is there to say about this film that hasn't been said a million times before. Well i'll start by saying that this is one of the greatest films ever made, not in a auteur sense and not even in a plot sense, but just the fact that this film is stupid and it knows it. It's not like the 'politicaly correct' action films of now like The Expendables which tries to have a deeper meaning but fails, this films has no point to make and is happy with that. Even though many people discredit this film for having a wafer thin plot thats what i enjoy so much about it, and the one-liners, its like a witty British man wrote them they are so dry they make sand seem wet. i mean what would you rather have a serious film that has no sense of humour that has so many plots it's a cemetery or a film that knows it's stupid but makes up for it with over the top action, macho hero's and big guns and stupidly murderous villains and one-liners.10/10",Commando

I could watch this over and over again and each time I'd laugh at the cracking one liners and the excellent but over-the-top characters and of course the unintentionally hilarious opening credits. In some ways, it is a masterpiece of action film making, there isn't a dull moment and although this probably doesn't come as a surprise, there is a ludicrously high kill count.

306,jackmoss88,THE 80s Action Movie,9,25 October 2009,"When I watch Commando, I am reminded of Entertainment Weekly's review of Uwe Boll's disastrous video game adaptation, Alone In The Dark:""When the giant, intelligent bees of the future sift through the ashes of our civilization, they will find Alone in the Dark, and they will understand. It's so bad it's postmodern."" - Scott Brown We are the giant bees of the future sifting through the remains of the 1980s, and when we find Commando, we understand. Traditional boundaries between ""good"" and ""bad"" are demolished, and the concepts blur until they become one. Commando is good because it's bad, bad for exactly the reasons that make it so good.Only in the 80s could a film like this have been taken at face value. In fact, the film acts as a sort of shadow play of the tackily neon, terribly hairstyled soul of 1980s American culture. In these more enlightened times, it's easy to laugh at Commando's 80s terribleness: the homoerotic undertones, the ridiculous dialogue, the implausible stunts, the comically excessive violence, the simple right-wing ideology underpinning the slaughter. But Commando transcends the tropes of the 80s action genre by embracing its own ludicrousness. It's almost as if the film-makers knew that the genre they were operating in was absurd, and decided to embrace the absurdity and push it to its very limits. They were making the film for the evolved future generations of movie fans.Probably the biggest clue is in the film's plot, which I'll summarise: former commando John Matrix (!) has his daughter kidnapped by Arius, former dictator of a fictional Latin-American republic, who Matrix helped depose from his seat of power. In an ironic twist, Matrix is forced to assassinate the same president he helped to install, or his daughter dies. His character must struggle through an inner moral battle, with the life of his daughter weighed up against the freedom of a nation.Except none of it ever happens. Arnie's character resolutely ignores the plot: he kills every bad guy who tries to talk to him, until they resort to strapping him down on a table just to tell him the plot essentials. Having been put on a plane to begin his mission, Arnie kills the goon watching over him and exits the aircraft mid-take-off in a scene that's completely implausible for at least three wonderful reasons. From there on, he spends the rest of the film murdering every bad guy in sight with a resolute lack of moral concern.This is a film where the hero almost literally shoots the plot in the head until the film is over. It's as though another, much smarter film is in there, only for John Matrix, the essence of 80s action distilled and coalesced into one character, to symbolically shoot it in the head in favour of the quip-filled, hilarious, utterly stupid madness that actually makes it onto the screen.The film acts out its generic meta-dialogue within its own screenplay. It becomes 80s action multiplied by 80s action. The 80s squared. The 6400s, if you will. This is why Commando isn't just an 80s action movie but THE 80s action movie, why the quips are funnier, the body-count higher, the bad guys more comical, the action more satisfying, the celebration of the hero's uber-manliness so over-zealous. The film-makers saw the light at the end of the tunnel, and it was the muzzle flare of a minigun.",Commando

This may lower your opinion of Freddy, but remember his absolute brilliant performance at Live Aid as a redeeming factor.Anyways, Arnold's daughter (Alyssa) gets kidnapped by Freddy.  This really ticks off Arnold. Future tip: If you are flying coach with Arnold, give up the window seat, as he hates the aisle. I MEAN HE REALLY HATES THE AISLE SEAT! You know how the beverage cart bangs you in the elbow and then the stewardess says, `Watch your elbow'?  One to many times for Arnold and he snaps, if you get my meaning. Bad guy exiting gives Arnold 11 hours, pick up a date, kill a member of a '80's rock group, destroy a classic MG and keyboardist and a pair of undersized, discounted Speedos to go after his daughter. Arnold KILLS everyone! If you had a relative in California in the '80's, Arnold kills him or her in this movie. I lost count after the first 18 or 20 million. I mean he goes as far as killing one bad guy with an 8' Black & Decker fine tooth table saw blade. This blade was introduced in the late 70s's to cut laminates, wall board and minimum wage movie bad guys.The BIG SHOWDOWN happens when Psychotic Freddy Mercury is interrupted from singing `We are the Champions' .

Of course I could say  `Another  bites the Dust' , but I wont.The entire Hollywood Special Op's Forces show up EXACTLY 23 seconds too late.

At this point he deplanes, runs into `Quest for Fire's ` Rae Dawn Chong', seat aborts a really nice MG and chases down the lead singer of Wang Chung, totals MG and punishes Wang for violations against humanity.

310,asenstoyan4ev,Superb Commando Movie,9,26 December 2016,"A Commando movie? Here it is! Wow! A great one! Just look at the tagline. A huge achievement in the ""funny action movie"" genre with a mind blowing budget of 10 000 000 $.a commando movieDirector Marc L. Lester known for such classics in the genre as the Stephen King's adaptation ""Firestarter"",""Showdown in little Tokyo"" and much more, has done a great job , helping Arnie to show all of his potential in this blasting roller coaster .There aren't any known names in the cast, to draw your attention off from Arnold, like for example Sharon Stone does in ""Total Recall"".The Plot:The plot is far from original but this is not so important, simply because only a retard would expect deep character development and story narrowing like in the ""Godfather"".Arnold is John Matrix, a very tough badass (what do you expect) and retired elite Commando who lives a peaceful live in the forest until one day several pricks kidnap his little daughter in order to blackmail him to lead a revolution and to give the power back to an evil dictator.This is a Funny Action Movie because:From the first scene in which Arnold appears, you have to be impressed by his strength and the shape of his muscles. The guy is walking in the forest and carrying a gigantic tree on his shoulder, looking like a lethal killing machine. Basically, in every scene he is beating his chest and screaming ""I am the bodybuilding itself"".Basically, in every scene he is beating his chest and screaming ""I am the bodybuilding itself"".And it really looks like Arnie is shooting the film between his chest training breaks. He's full of protein, testosterone and ready to explode. It is very funny when he is cutting woods as well, or when he is naked and playing with his beloved daughter in the river. How sweet Daddy he is! It is a bit like watching Rambo feeding little puppies.The dialogue is so hilarious and dumb that you keep thinking that some 5-year-old kid is the screenwriter. Mr. Schwarzenegger's acting is as stiff as usual, so you definitely won't be disappointed.There are plenty of ridiculous lines as well. For instance, when John Matrix promises to a bad guy that he will kill him last but he kills him before the others (because of the steroids washed his brain) by throwing him off of a rock, this goes like this ""Remember, Matrix, when you told me that you will kill me last. "" With a cold look on his rocky face, Matrix confesses ""I lied!!!!!!"" and throws him away. Of course, this line is shaped with a significant amount of hilarious Austrian accent.Happily, there are plenty of such lines like for example ""Right? –""Wrong"" as is the answer of Arnold after shooting one poor bad guy in the stomach and he dies, being probably the 345th victim of the cold-blooded Commando.The grand finale of the movie can make you feel pain in the cheeks from laughing while you are questioning yourself ""How one could make such a movie and meant it to be serious?!"" John Matrix is shooting with a machine gun in the dictator's quarters and kills approximately a thousand of mercenaries without even a scratch on his body.Conclusion:You need to be ashamed if you love the Arnold flicks and you've missed this one. It is one of his best and definitely worth your time if you want to make a six-pack without doing even one exercise.Go watch it and tell me what do you think about it after your laughing spasms stop!

311,darthgeekhi,"A Corny, But Fun, 80s Action Movie",7,11 September 2017,"If you're not familiar with my review system, I break up my review into segments. Plot, characters, narrative, acting, writing, visuals, and, in this case (and other action movie reviews to come) action. Without further ado, these are my thoughts on the 1985 action film, Commando.Plot:The premise of Commando is simple. Former Special Forces soldier John Matrix, (btw, one of the most badass names in cinema history) played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, lives in peace with his daughter Jenny, played by a young Alyssa Milano, until she's kidnapped by Arius, a Latin dictator, played by Dan Hedaya who is aided by Bennett, John's former Special Forces partner. Arius requires John to kill someone in power to reinstate Arius as ruler. If John steps out of line, his daughter gets her throat slit like warm butter (according to a sadistic guard). Little did Arius know that he was screwing with Arnold Schwarzenegger. With help from a new friend Cindy, Matrix is ready to kick ass and eat Green Berets for breakfast. And he's super hungry. Commando has a basic premise, and the plot does flow smoothly, though it lacks logic. It doesn't give you enough time to breath and ask questions. It's an extremely cheesy plot, and feels almost like an old 1960s cop show it's so over-the-top, and that's why I'll lay off of critiquing the plot.Characters: Anyone looking for fun characters like in Die Hard or Terminator, will be disappointed with the characters in this film. Save for John Matrix, everyone in this movie is pretty forgettable. If I hadn't looked him up for this review, I wouldn't be able to remember a thing about Arius, who is a primary character. Narry a character development in this movie. By the end, Matrix is still a badass dad, in the end, Cindy is basically the same character she was at the beginning. But, again, this is a cheesy 80s action movie. The camp is through the roof. The characters are forgettable, and harmless.Narrative: The movie does move quickly, and is better as a result. I don't know if a 2-hour Commando would've kept me as engaged as an hour and a half Commando. The runtime is short, it's almost like a TV episode. However, I will say the airport/mall car chase scene is a little longer than it should be, but I don't think it hurts the pacing too bad. The great thing is, they throw is right into the action. In the first minute, some random civilian gets shot up by uzis. The movie never lets up, and I'll say that's a redeeming factor against all the cheese.Acting: The performances in this movie are awful. The lines are delivered so dramatically, there's no subtlety to the acting. So I will say this once more; it works. If I had to fill a container up with the amount of cheese in this movie, I'd need a couple gallons. The campy performances make sense in the campy context of the movie. Writing: Lines are cheesy, causes and effects are cheesy, it's a cheesy movie, end of story.Visuals: Visuals are standard action movie visuals. If I can remember one image, it's John Matrix in cameo makeup.Action: It's campy. But. It. Works. The action in this movie is fun. You can clearly point out the faults, like how blood squibs aren't where they should be, or just aren't there at all. Heck, I thought I was watching an episode of Power Rangers for a second. It is however, fun, like an Arnold movie should be. Commando is a fun, campy 80s action movie that I personally really enjoyed. It's a movie I could pop in and watch any ol' time. Where cheesy plot and bad acting fail, fun and corny action and a fast pace succeed.",Commando

The laughter we shared while watching Arnie's body count rise to a whopping 120 is something that will always have a special place in my heart. And then there's the astoundingly humorous lines - surely the corniest in living memory. Who can forget the absolutely magnificent ""I let him go"" or ""Don't disturb my friend, he's dead tired"". And my personal favourite ""Let off some steam Bennet"". It is a travesty of justice that this movie didn't win a single Oscar.

323,yvonnelowrie,"If you like action, watch this!",10,14 May 2012,"The movie is about a retired army commando John Matrix (arnold Schwarzenegger) who lives with his daughter (Alyssa Milano) in a cabin locked away from any trouble, but his daughter is kidnapped by a solider called Bennet (vernon wells) in his division who he removed. He trys to get his revenge but John Matrix goes into action mode and shoots is way with a women called Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) to his daughter who knows her dad will come! If you love action and gore well you will love this. Arnold plays the main character who gets his daughter kid-napped. At first i thought it would be one of these low budget 'B-movies' made in the 80's, but was shocked when I saw it. Arnold 'asusual!' plays his part like it had happened to him, I think the movie 'Taken' which was also brilliant had a bit of copying but what the hell at least they were both great!",Commando
324,ovaltinejenkins10,A Classic Arnold Movie,9,19 October 2013,"John Matrix(Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator, True Lies.) is a retired Black Ops Commando, who lives in the country with his daughter. So it makes perfect sense for someone to kidnap his daughter and force him to kill the South American President. They have him take a plane to go kill him, but not everything goes according to their plan, and as you may guess Matrix escapes without a scratch. After escaping from the plane that lands in 11 hours, he must go save his daughter before they realize he is gone. Remind you of anything? *cough*Taken*cough*So that sets the story in motion. And from then on it becomes a typical Schwarzenegger film. Not that that is a bad thing. He eventually teams up with Cindy(Rae Dawn Chong Jeff Who Lives at Home, The Color Purple.) And from then on out I can promise numerous explosions, deaths, and a death by pitchfork. There isn't much depth to it, but Commando is an extremely entertaining movie and I definitely recommend it.",Commando

The action scenes are awesome, the characters all have depth and you love them, you hate them. This is the action movie that really changed the landscape of action movies. If you watch action movies before this they didn't hit this level, this raised the level of the entire genre. Rae Dawn Chong gives a great performance, Vernon Wells kills it as bennett. All the bad guys in this movie make you dislike them, you find yourself cheering for bloodshed because of what has been done to a young Alyssa Milano.

328,P00H-7,Alot of fun,10,24 January 2002,"There were many senseless action films made in the 80's, mostly Stallone flicks, but one action film rose above all the others and still stands today as one great piece of 80's entertainment.Commando unfortunately doesn't get the credit it deserves, and I think the reason for that is that the perception of the audience is somewhat blurred by the assumptions made about the film, being a dumb action flick in the vein of Rambo. This film however does something that Rambo didn't and that is, Commando refused to take itself seriously. It knowingly went way over the top, and gave discerning audiences some great fun, this film is absolutely hilarious.To begin with, the whole premise just makes me laugh. A former US Commando's (Arnie) old team decide to use him to assisinate some higher up in South America, they determine the best way to get him to do it is to kidnap his daughter(alyssa Milano) and hold her until completion of the assisnation. Well they manage to get her and put Arnie on a plane headed for South America with explicite instructions to kill the guy, in order to get his daughter back safely. Well in any other dumb action film the hero would probably try and think of a way to get his daughter back without tipping off the Bad guys, it would all lead to a last minute convoluted plan. Not this film, Arnie's character decides without any hesitation that the best thing to do is kill everyone.This is what makes Commando so much fun, there are no illusions or messages, mixed with great dry humour and pretty violent killings Commando is one joyride of an era gone by, oure 80's fun.",Commando

I rarely have such a good time watching a movie.I'm not sure if Arnold though this was serious material, but I don't and so I can really enjoy it. So many moments are just liberating and exhilerating in their sheer badness. Arnold and Alyssa Milano petting a deer, the fact that John Matrix can throw off eight guys but still struggle against Bennett, an overweight loser in chain mail who fancies himself a rival for Arnold, Dan Hedaya's horrible accent, the pointless nudity during the motel fight, all of it contributes to a wonderful time.For sheer laugh out loud fun, Commando delivers the goods. 10/10",Commando

It is not like most films, where you are trying to figure out what's going on, why the bad guys are bad or doing what they're doing---in this movie, it is all clear. And there is no mystery to be spoiled. For example, you can't watch Sixth Sense over and have the same feelings about it. But Arnold as John Matrix, the one man army/good guy smashing the bad guys, you know what is going to happen, and they made it happen in the most delightful fashion. Funny, non-stop action, silly, but single-minded and purposeful. I can watch him drop Sully over and over, watch him pick up the phone booth over and over, and it is still funny and exciting. He is obviously a super-hero, after all, no bullet can touch him. When Rae Dawn Chong blasts him out of the police van, he gets out without a scratch, just some soot! No problem, he is indestructible, and he is going to get his daughter back. Just what any one of us guys would do in the same situation if we were invincible. Love it to death!",Commando

I saw it & I was overwhelmed with a great soundtrack & awesome CGI. Arnie was great but some other people need to work on it. I definitely think it deserves higher than a 6 out of ten, an eight at the least.

It really is incredible how much money is put into these movies and the extent to which it is wasted on horrible punch lines and bad story plots. If you remember this movie you may have seen the last seen when Arnold rips a pipe off the wall and sticks it through the bad guys chest, which happens to be covered in chain male, and puts it straight through the guy all the way into a boiler behind him.

That Arnold is not a good actor, is just wrong, cause he really delivers in this movie. He was made for movies like this!

Seriously, they could have tried to make him seem physically threatening especially when he's 30lbs overweight next to a shirtless Arnie. Commando is pure 80's action from start to finish, and it's got it all: Retired ex-military spec-ops lead: check. Villain with a ludicrous outfit and moustache: check. Revenge plot: check. Car chase: check. Explosions: check. Gear-up scene: check. One-liners: check and double check!Commando doesn't try to be anything more than it is; it's a simple premise and it's only ever that. While some action films try to take themselves too seriously, or have some underlying theme which they allow to rise just enough for the audience to notice, Commando doesn't care for that.

338,MrCosmosPhD,A Body Count that Won't Quit,6,19 February 2018,"There is perhaps no man alive who better thrives in the genre of ""muscly men shooting people"" more so than Arnold Schwarzenegger. Certainly, fierce competition exists in the forms of, say, Stallone or Snipes, but Arnold has worked tirelessly throughout the final stretch of the 20th Century amassing a body count that would make most dictators envious. Nowhere does this sentiment ring truer than Mark L. Lester's 1985 shoot-em-up, ""Commando."" I'll relay the plot to you in the briefest of descriptions I can. Former Col. John Matrix (the Governator himself) has his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano in her first major role) kidnapped by a group of criminals, including former squadron mate Bennett (played by genuine Australian Vernon Wells), and, with the assistance of flight attendant Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), must push and claw his way to her rescue through the most explosive means possible. ""Commando"" is a film I would describe as being an ideal viewing for a lazy afternoon, where deeper, substantial layers are not of concern and disbelief be damned. There is not a scrap of metal in John Matrix's arsenal that goes unused-everything from rocket launchers (backwards too, in one instance) sawblades in a shed, a bountiful bouquet of buckshot for authoritarian-hopeful and mercenary leader, Arius (the ever-so succulently sleazy Dan Hedeya), and everything in between. I would, nevertheless, not be so quick to deny credit to Arius's men-it is not that they are bad at hitting John, but rather excellent at hitting everything around him. All jesting aside, the film does reach the point of John being so unstoppable as to decrease overall investment in the action scenes, even with the intimidating presence of Bennett (who may resemble a larger Freddie Mercury, but trust me, he ain't singing, so don't stop him now). The film furthermore finds assistance from a pulse-pounding soundtrack delivered by the unfortunately late James Horner, which provides many action and stealth scenes with some of the tension lost due the fact that Arnold is a juggernaut of testosterone and metal parts (how else does he walk out of an exploding police van nearly unscathed?). However, I could not shake the impression that the character of Gen. Kirby (James Olsen) could have been removed from the film entirely without much of the story changing, as he had very little to offer beyond the pickup at the end-Colonel San Trautman he is not, that much is true.Despite its flaws, some evident, ""Commando"" yet survives as the quintessential popcorn flick, one able to be enjoyed both in solitude and in the presence of others, with enough one-liners and reckless destruction of studio-issued property to satisfy your crave for unbridled machismo.""Let off some steam!""",Commando

Arnold has always been a kind of robotic actor and very stiff if you really pay attention to him, but that's because he has played a robot and a stiff action hero. The thing is in this movie he was to stiff. In this movie he has a daughter and he just acts the same as he does in all his other action movies. That wasn't the worst part of the movie, the worst part was who they chose to be the bad guy, Vernon Wells. Normally I would be okay with them picking him as the bad guy, but the thing is he didn't have a chance to beat Arnold even if he was a green beret. I would've cast someone more muscular or at least made Vernon get in shape he looked like he belonged in a gay bar in the 80's.
I love the girl who played Arnold's daughter I can see she put a lot of character analysis into this character and the script helped out with that too. In the end it's not the best one of his movies but I say it's still worth the watch.",Commando

Again, another spectacular one-liner that will make so much sense to you after you watch the movie. You will definitely laugh at that one.Of course, this movie wasn't all about Arnold one-liners (even though they were a great part of it). It had great action sequences in the mall scene, and the car chase was also equally great. The only reason this is not a 9 or 10 out of 10 like some other Arnold flicks is because it the plot isn't as good.

Hedaya has the worst wannabe Cuban accent ever and Rae Dawn Chong is really annoying in the movie which the makes the movie even sweeter. But by far my favorite character is Sully.

355,kjamestriplett,One of the most quintessential action movies of the 80's,9,14 November 2021,"An absolute cracker, ""Commando"" (1985) is the ultimate 80's Schwarzenegger package, replete with a threadbare plot, outsized action, and endless one liners.The movie is about a retired Special Forces colonel named John Matrix who must make an attempt to save his daughter after she was abducted by one of his former subordinates.This film has to be the best interpretation of the Governator as good as Hollywood could ever offer. Flashy, fleeting and exciting, Commando came at a time in what was still the fairly early point in bona fide action star Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, and it encapsulated as well as practically established every trademark element that was so likable about most of his films and screen charisma. This flick probably has a better-than-usual script for this sort of fare, and shows a lot of humor, which is one of the movie's biggest takeaways.Let me just say for the record that Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my personal heroes, and one of the best movie entertainers ever. If there's ever been one actor to make an exception for that doesn't have great range, it has to be him. I mean he certainly doesn't play the same roles, and he's certainly not playing a Barbarian or a cyborg hit man here. Regardless, Arnie was a perfectly fitting lead to fill the films title role, but as usual, one can expect he doesn't show much substance more so than style, but against all odds, that's all he's ever really needed. Other cast members include Rae Dawn Chong, Alyssa Milano, Dan Hedaya, Vernon Wells, James Olson, David Patrick Kelly, and Bill Duke. The quixotic and larky Rae Dawn Chong's welcome presence and sarcastic commentary in this movie could not appropriately lend comic counterpoint for those who are unaware of these types of movies. The glancing humor between her and the straight-faced killing machine of Schwarzenegger is delightful, and she manages to turn in a delightful performance on her own, and really lights up the picture like a firefly. Likewise, then child actress Alyssa Milano is very impressive as Matrix's daughter Jenny, and she shares seemingly natural chemistry with Schwarzenegger. Dan Hedaya and Vernon Wells villains are quintessential examples of the decade's bad guy types. On one hand, you have Hedaya's nuanced and laid back villain who wants to assume absolute power, and on the other hand you have Wells' over the top, all out lunatic performance as the guy who has personal beef with the movie's lead hero, and both of their performances are effortlessly cool and charismatic.This is the perfect vehicle for Schwarzenegger to flex his muscles, fire endless bullets, cause big mayhem, and spout endless catchphrases that only he could deliver with such perfect deadpan manner. If you see so much as the tagline of the movie: ""Let's Party!"" then chances are you already know what kind of film this is, and how it'll play out. For me, it's all about the experience, and the fun to be had along the way. There's something weirdly appealing about the self-deprecating celebration of violent excess with Commando, and the fact that this movie is of a mind not to take itself too seriously is simply all in good fun. Thankfully, the film is self aware of all of that, which makes it a little more enjoyable. Director Mark L. Lester's direction is consistent, fast moving and assured, and the film's crisp pacing perfectly compliments that.The stunts are cool, and the action set pieces never cease to entertain either, which are practically non stop, the big takeaways being Matrix fighting off mall cops, to a motel room fight, and I still regard the climactic villa shootout that takes place in the last 15 minutes of the picture one of the single best action takes ever, all topped off with every ingredient one can hope for out of these kinds of films: Fistfights, gunfights, knife fights, large scale explosions, traps, death defying stunts, occasional thrills and suspense, not to mention the best one liners in cinematic history ever, which is partly why it's so funny. As absurd as it is, it's certainly good fun. One of this movie's definite highlights is James Horner's adrenaline fueled music score which screams 80's ingenuity, and the music score ends on a high note with hit track single, ""Someday, Somehow, Someone's Gotta Pay"" otherwise known as ""We Fight for Love"" by The Power Station. And as far as single tracks for movies go, this one is a winner, and couldn't sum up this movie's plot and spirit any better.While Commando is certainly over the top, it rightfully earned its place as one of Schwarzenegger's most popular flicks and a defining example of why he's so charismatic, let alone it being a milestone in 80's action films that is practically the granddaddy of the genre for the decade. Although better genre efforts certainly hit the theater beforehand and afterwards, none have probably better captured the spirit and possibilities of how likable, laid back and ridiculously fun a movie can be such as Commando has, and many would certainly go on to copy it. This is simply Schwarzenegger doing what he does best as well as he usually does it for an hour and a half straight. Nothing more, nothing less. It's not the best film he's been in, but by all rights, it's probably his best movie.9.0/10.",Commando
356,phynes-64362,Good Fun,8,13 December 2020,"Probably the best Schwarzenegger movie. Potentially a great cult movie for those who like to quote movie lines to their friends at parties.
Lots of action, and lots of classic deadpan comedic lines from Schwarzenegger.
Movies like True Lies are more glitzy and sophisticated, Twins is very funny, but Commando is the best overall showcase for Arnie.
And...I do know my movies. I had seen almost all of Eisenstein by the time I was 10, and Kurosawa by my teenage years. The movie I have watched most often is The Big Lebowski and I love nordic noir.",Commando

Easy have Matrix and Bennett battle, also with out Vernon Wells the movie would have suck. He play the perfect bad guy, because he want to kill Matrix so bad he did it for free. How about funny quotes? Don't wake my friend he died tired. Watch this movie because it was greatest movie of all-time. Vernon Wells should have won the academy and the movie should have won best picture award.",Commando
360,partymachine221,Absolute Perfection,10,4 February 2001,"""Commando"" is undoubtedly Arnie's best.  The movie begins with John Matrix's (schwarzenegger) daughter (alyssa milano) getting kidnapped.  Basically Matrix has a little over 10 hours to save his daughter from an evil dictator, and in order to get her back, he has to take on a bunch of hoodlums, corrupt ex-Green Berets, and a small army.The screenplay, by Steven E. deSouza, is a masterpiece.  Granted, it's not brilliant along the lines of Shakespeare, but for an action movie, it's wonderful.  Chock full of wit, deSouza never makes the mistake of having the movie take itself to seriously; he maintains an excellent balance of hardcore action while at the same time creating a lovely spoof of the action genre.The acting is exactly how it should be for a movie of this genre.  I'm a little bit tired of everyone saying ""Arnie can't act""  ""he's such a bad actor"" and so on.  Obviously, actors such as Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hanks are better dramatic actors, but would any of us really want to see Sir Hopkins kicking the c**p out of almost one hundred people in a movie?  i think not.  Schwarzenegger plays Matrix wonderfully, delivering his lines with the right amount of wit and sarcasm, and delivering his punches fairly realistically.See ""Commando"" if you like action movies.  It won't fail to satisfy you. If, on the other hand, you are not a fan of action movies, don't expect this one to win you over.",Commando

362,Shenzi,Leave your brain at the door.,6,24 July 2001,"First of all, let me say that the plot in this movie is thinner than tissue-paper. John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is paid a visit from an old war buddy who was thought to be dead. He then kidnaps Matrix's daughter, and what follows is the typical, over-used plotline: Matrix must do what they say or they'll kill his daughter, but of course he doesn't, and starts hunting them down.Terrible plot aside, it's actually pretty good, with plenty of action, lots of explosions and guns, and plenty of killing. If you like mindless violence, then you're sure to love Commando.However, some parts of it are blatantly unrealistic. One thing I noticed in particular was when Matrix was shooting a bunch of soldiers with a machinegun - the bullet ribbon hanging out of the side clearly had about 20 left, yet he fired at least 100 shots without the ribbon decreasing in size. Or perhaps the way every one of his bullets hit his target, while all the enemy soldiers missed. Not to mention the fact that his grenades managed to kill the enemy soldiers with ease, while one detonating right next to him barely caused a scratch. As a friend of mine commented, he's ""part-time commando, part-time magician"".Honestly, there's nothing about the plot that even came close to surprising me, and the ending was predictable. I'm not saying this was a bad movie - I'm just saying that it was extremely mindless and full of plot holes.For the action fans out there, I'd give it **** out of *****. For those of you who prefer something more intellectual, ** out of *****.",Commando

We had a horrible taped copy of Commando that i must've watched at least a hundred times. This movie is simply a classic with its never ending action, explosions and cheesy lines. The story itself is simple; John Matrix's(Shwarzenegger) daughter(Alyssa Milano) has been kidnapped and the movie is simply what he has to go through to get his daughter back. I've been reading the site and of course there are PLENTY of goofs and production mess ups but it doesn't matter because this movie as all about fun. Definitely a must see for any movie fan.",Commando
364,kashpunj,Classic Arnie flick,7,9 July 2007,"Let's make something clear: from a cinematic and rhetorical standpoint, Commando is below average. It isn't an original yarn or an Oscar nominee but if you like your movies with a mega dose of action, blood, and really really big guns, then there is much to like with Commando. The premise behind Commando is reminiscent of any other 70s or 80s action flick: Arnie plays John Matrix, a former killing machine with the army looking to settle down and raise his kid, played by a young Alyssa Milano. As you might already surmise, through a series of events Arnie's kid gets captured and now he must save her by teaming up with a flight attendant played by Rae Dawn Chong. Not exactly deep stuff, but the weak plot works to set up the action. The action is nonstop and intense; cars blow up, limbs are chopped, and many, many people are killed during Arnie's quest to get his daughter back. In particular, a sequence with Arnie mowing down dozens of soldiers is classic 80s style gore. The sequences are tight and the action is great, but the story is a bit weak and at 90 minutes long, some parts feel rushed. Commando falls short of the Rambo movies and Predator in terms of story and direction, but if you have a hankering for 80s action near its best, this is it",Commando
365,SMEELAR,maximum appraisal,10,22 January 2002,"This film has got to be the finest action film in the history of the world. The plot is negligible, but the action sequences are some of the best, and the sheer tackiness of it is magnificent. Watch out for the wire attached to the guy's leg in the cliff dangling scene, and the most unbelievably long explosion of wooden huts. Virtually all of Arnie's lines are instantly quotable, including my favourite, ""We'll take Cook's car, he won't be needing it."" If you're depressed at all, and need cheering up, then this is the film for you, and even if you don't have that long, then just watch the super cheesy beginning with Matrix and his daughter, and you'll be grinning for hours.",Commando

The plot is very simple, Arnold goes after a crime lord to get his daughter back from him. Arnold is pure beast in this movie, mowing down anyone who gets in his way, holding an m- 60 with one hand! His hand to hand combat is also crazy as he slices away with his machete! This is probably in the top 5 best made action movies of all time. The one-liners in this movie are classic, you'll never find them anywhere else. I don't want to give any of them away, you'll be laughing your head off when you hear them though!The supporting cast is also great and they all fit into their roles perfectly. Arnold in this movie has no expression, he has a look of pure determination and intensity throughout the whole movie, even when he cracks a joke!All I can say this is one of the funnest movies you'll ever watch, all the haters are just jealous, wishing they had a favourite movie as beast as this one is!

This film is not meant to be taken that seriously and is a great popcorn flick, with plenty of action and gun battles. Shot at a time when Arnie did many of these hyped-up ""overkill"" films, including Running Man and Total Recall the action is non-stop and fast paced.Despite the acting ability of almost all the cast being below adequate, the script is very well put together with many well-timed and funny one-liners for Schwarzenegger, in particular ""remember when i said i'd kill you last?.......... i lied""Overall just an average movie but definitely one worth seeing, particularly for Schwarzenegger fans and for anyone else with a rainy afternoon to pass.",Commando
370,Raz2152112,As close to perfect as it gets.,10,14 August 2004,"Commando is the greatest movie ever made. This movie aspires to be nothing more than a great action movie and succeeds in every way. The director and screenwriter have no delusions about making a think piece or movie that will move you to a religious experience. They simply wanted to make a movie about a man, his hot daughter and love of violence. As in all great action movies we have a man of violence who has left all of that behind him. He simply wants to live in the mountains, watch his daughter grow up, and eat ice cream. Of course, this couldn't happen. It wouldn't be Commando. Anyways, the bad guys force him out of hiding and instead of enlisting help or trying to find a peaceful solution to the problem he kills and makes jokes. John Matrix (Arnold) embarks on a mission of creative killing and funny one-liners. Enough people have already written on how this movie plays to Arnold's strengths and describe his various deeds. I think the scene that really sets this movie apart is the attention to detail. No, not the part where the porsche gets wrecked and fixed before Arnold pushes it over. Next time you watch the film, turn the TV up very loud when Arnold is fighting Cook. When Arnold picks Cook up by his testicles you can hear the crunch and the air escaping Cook's mouth. Only the greatest movie of all time would take the time to properly document that tremendous event. This movie is as close to perfect as it gets. In the 150 times i have watched Commando the only way I think it could be improved is if Matrix kills Rae Dawn Chong at the end. That would go along better with the theme of the movie.",Commando

It is a massively underrated action thriller that kept Arnold Schwarzenegger busy between 80s blockbusters Commando is one of the last shoot-out films ever to have real characters in it. Not, of course, that they're anything other than stereotypes, but they're painted with such detailed, positive strokes that it's impossible not to relate to them. Arnie plays a retired special-ops officer whose daughter (Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped by the baddest of bad guys, who'll only hand her back when he assassinates a republican president in some banana republic country on their behalf. Needless to say, Arnie is deeply annoyed by this and single-handed amid more bullets and explosions than you can shake a stuntman's pay check at, well, why spoil the fun by revealing any more?

373,justabloke616,Absolutely hilarious. Arnold's pinnacle achievement.,10,24 November 2006,"This is probably the best movie that Arnold Schwarzenegger has made (even surpassing T2), not because it has any plot development, realistic action sequences, or anything else that you would expect, but because it is HILARIOUS. The amount of laugh-out-loud moments in Commando is on par with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Borat, and other such films. YES, it is THAT funny.What other action movie opens with the hero and his daughter feeding a deer and licking ice cream? What other movie has lines like ""I eat green berets for breakfast. And right now I'm very hungry""? And Arnold, as John Matrix, was dodging bullets (and killing the population of a small country) long before that pussy Neo was even born.Commando also has one of the best baddies of all time in Bennett.

Being an action movie, the plot doesn't need to have a big significance to begin with, but it seemed as if the plot was headed in one direction and ended in another. Besides Matrix and his daughter, the characters were quite out-of-place and didn't do as much as they probably should have. Having said that, the action sequences were what made it watchable for me and seeing Arnold hip-firing a machine gun just hits my soft spot. Being a fan of Arnold and what he's known for, it was quite the experience to see him deliver those classic one-liners that I've only ever seen on YouTube before. ""Right?"" ""Wrong"".

The dialogue between Matrix and Cook in the motel room (""This Green Beret's gonna kick your ass!"") and Bennett's speech in the finale (""I don't need the gun, John! I can beat you!"") is fantastic. As long as you don't expect a poker-faced action film, you will love Commando. The humour, for the most part, is intentional, but I think even the film-makers didn't realise how funny the film looks.

Also why do all these retired American military have foreign accents. Arnold with his Austrian accent and his nemesis who was in his old unit is Australian.

Great pacing, with the simplistic story moving forward from one fun scene to the next.The director's cut adds a short scene of unnecessary exposition (the movie is better without it) but also a few gruesome bad guy deaths (which are fun).

394,phil-hootz-houghton,"Poor, emotionless brilliance",9,17 January 2007,"From the minute Arnold Schwarznegger appears in the opening montage brandishing a clearly fibreglass log, then feeding a deer and making a mess of an ice cream with daughter Jenny (probably Milano's strongest acting role), all artistic integrity has been replaced by steroid-infested testosterone. Each celluloid frame has been meticulously crafted to contain as many horrendous acts of violence and even more horrendous one liners.Supported by the underrated Vernon Wells as Bennet and a variety of goons which would seem hand picked out of a Chinatown strip club, action is the highest priority, leaving character development and story the last port of call (in Val Verde as it were). Arnie fails to act the concerned, compassionate father the corny opening sequence proposes, and instead commences a blood lust rampage clearly jeopardizing his daughter's life. But who will go to this film expecting any more of Schwarznegger? Watch it for the explosions, elaborate deaths, plot errors and mistakes, and short bursts of dialogue before/after the already mentioned elaborate deaths. Enjoy, laugh and love the 100 minutes without human emotion this provides.",Commando

Vernon Wells is to feminine to play that part, does anyone agree with me? if you watch him through out the movie he isn't scary and doesn't intimidate at all,i like Arnolds movie's but in this one they should have gave him justice by getting a more believable person to play Bennett. hope i didn't offend anyone this is just my feelings, it didn't turn me off to watching his other movies, Arnold i have to say has come along ways in his actor from his first movie Hercules in New York where the over dub his voice,Keep going Arnold your doing good",Commando

397,xmark21,Oldschool and Hardcore action!,10,4 April 2007,"This movie is one of the greatest action movies ever!It may be a bad movie compared to todays standards. Today everybody expects a movie to be realistic and intelligent. But if you look at it, as one of the keystones of the action genre, you will find that it is an excellent movie! It is from a time when action was ACTION, from a time before John Woo's ""The Killer"" and before movies had to have a complicated plot to be good.It is hardcore action, where the bad guys get to pay. It is nice to watch this movie, and enjoy the (more or less) unrealistic scenes, where Arnie kicks major ass.People may say that Arnie is a cliché, and a bad actor, but they just don't get it. In the 80's, this was just the kind of action movies that was made. The same is to say about the soundtrack: Rock'n'Roll from the (after my opinion) greatest era of rock music. Lots of hard electric guitar!This is a good movie, if you can appreciate it for what it is. If you don't like raw action movies and are for intellectual things, go watch ""Thirteen Days"".",Commando
398,kgluba,Extreme Kill Count,9,9 June 2007,"Whoever officially reviewed this movie either hasn't seen it, or had it on in the background while playing Dungeons & Dragons and paid no attention to it. I, on the other hand, am proud to have seen this tremendous piece of film history over 150 times. The summer when I was 11 years old, I would come home every day after baseball and watch the movie about 2-3 times a day. In one summer, I watched around 80 times. During which, I memorized most of the lines, and kept tallies of the kill count, which I averaged between 117-121, depending on whether you counted multiple kills when Matrix threw grenades and killed multiple enemy soldiers. Also, there is a scene when he uses anti-tank mines to blow up enemy barracks, one in particular was 3 stories tall and could have housed 50-150 soldiers comfortably. So, who knows how many this one-man-killing machine could have actually killed? In any event, this film embodied the 1980's bloodbath/action genre like no other film. Yes, I am a fan of the Rambo series, the Terminator's, the Punisher, Cyborg and any other action film starring Eastern European body-builder's turned actors, but Commando accomplishes what all of these other films set out to do, but with wittier dialogue (or monologue if you want to count Arnold's one-liners), a huge variety of weaponry, lower budget and in under 90 minutes (88 to be precise). I find myself to this day, in my awful Schwarzenegger impression, dropping lines from this movie to my friends and lady-friends at parties and at bars...""Hey Sully, remember when I told you I would kill you Last...I lied"", ""Let off some steam, Bennet"", ""You are going to need some more body bags"". I think the best scene in the movie, and probably the most realistic, is when after Matrix just blows his way into the heart of the enemy compound on the South American Island, after single handedly shooting his way through about 75 trained enemy militia, somehow, gets winged in the abs by a stray bullet and ducks into the tool shed to assess the damage. Then the mercenaries surround the place, and unload about 10,000 rounds into the shed. OK, who wants to be the sorry sap going in to make sure Arnie is dead? Come on, I would call in an air strike and napalm the place, just to make sure...but anyway...the dude opens the door, and Arnie swings down from the rafters. Machete's the first guys arm off, puts a pitchfork through another guys chest, then wings a circular-saw blade, throwing star style, into the the last morons head, slicing it in half and exposing his brain (I may have butchered the order, I haven't watched it in a few months). Seriously, I was 12 years old when I watched this and to this day I haven't snapped on my co-workers, pulled a Colombine and am completely normal to this day...this is one of my favorite movies of all-time and I can say with confidence that no other action movie, past or present, can hold a candle to it.",Commando
399,cabs100@hotmail.com,Best movie ever,10,18 August 2008,"Barely edging out such classics as Raw Deal and Predator (and I even loved Red Heat). Sadly, as much as Hollywood wants to pass the torch of next great action hero to such luminaries as The Rock (now resigned to Mr. Disney work), Arnold appears to be a once in 1,000,000 year discovery. As my friend who hates 99.9% of every movie ever made notes: I like Arnold's movies because for some reason, as campy as some of them are, you really believe he's kicking the cr*p out of armies, aliens and Thulsa Doom, and Commando is the best of them. I've probably watched this movie about 50 times and never, ever get tired of it. Totally mindless, violent and genius. It's funnier than most comedies as well. Looking forward to the director's cut which I just got in the mail, I have a feeling Arnold gets up every so often in the middle of the night, sneaks downstairs to the basement of the governor's mansion and watch Commando just to remind himself how bad he once was. I will name my first born son John Matrix (blank), I'm sure my wife Diamond will approve. These guys eat too much red meat, and that's not so bad.",Commando

403,zedd20010,Arguably The Greatest Action Movie Of All Time,10,9 September 2010,"This is easily Schwarzenegger's best performance, with catchy one-liners, witty humor and explosive action sequences, Arnold makes this original blend of hardcore action and light comedy a must see for any 80's fan. In the story, John Matrix (Schwarzenegger) must save his daughter, Jenny (Alyssa Milano) from a violent dictator who wants him to kill a president, in order to take over a small country. If Matrix doesn't do what they ask they will kill Jenny. Along the way, Matrix meets up with a stress filled (if that's a word) stewardess named Cindy, the two make an unlikely duo as her reluctant nature and his psychotic attitude often clash, leading to Cindy to have one over the top nervous breakdown after another, while Matrix could careless. The two go after Sully first, after he makes a move towards Cindy in an airport, lead to an all out slug fest between Matrix and several mall cops, leading to Sully getting away, with Matrix and Cindy in hot pursuit. Matrix catches up to Sully in no time, and kicks his @$$, until he finds a key to a sleazy motel, and ultimately ""Let's Him Go"". When they arrive at motel, Matrix hopes to find Jenny but just finds an empty room. He then sets a trap for one of Sully's partners, Cooke, and the two end up having the greatest fist fight in movie history. After killing Cooke, the two take Cooke's car, go shopping, kill two cops that arrest Matrix, go to a little P.O.S. of an airport/naval yard, kill six more guys there, then go to a small island in the middle of nowhere. This is where we get Arnold's full Balls to the Walls Special. Matrix then kills nearly a hundred more men (including the dictator) until it is down to him and a former partner/successor Bennitt, he convinces Bennett to release his daughter, and fight him man to man. During the fight, Bennitt gets the upper hand, and starts to taunt Matris, this leads to his death as Matrix makes his comeback and staples Bennitt to a wall with a pipe to the chest.Overall, this well worth a watch and should get more respect than it does. Out of all the movies I have seen and all the movies Arnold's been in, this one stands alone and belongs with his other greats. If you haven't seen it, you should; and if you have seen it, watch it again.Big Mike",Commando
404,Action_Is_Best,An inspiring film,10,21 February 2007,"Arnold puts on a riveting performance in this classic. Arnold shows that nothing is impossible, making it truly one of the most beautiful films to ever grace the silver screen. He single handedly takes down a guerilla force, with a climatic war at the end. This film inspired me to start my own business which is very successful. I realized that nothing is impossible and just be the best at what you do. Arnold brilliantly displays these qualities in Commando. Arnold has the character of John Matrix down to a tee and even guys like Jack Nicholson, De Niro, and Pacino could never put on a performance that Arnold did.Commando also shows that family is of high importance and perfectly captures the dedication that may be needed to help someone in need.

406,Roger-Thornhill,Arnie as One Man Army - First Movie Installment,6,11 August 2008,"On the face of it, 'Commando' is formulaic adolescent action stuff. From the moment the first bit part actor is torn into pieces by binmen touting semi-automatic weapons and their resulting snappy one liner, you know what to expect: violence, ungainly cliché, ridiculous plot development and guns. Lots and lots of guns.The thing is, all these shortcomings actually make the film. 'Commando' is THE template 'One Man Army' Film which has been imitated, but never bettered. Simpsons fans will see the homage of Ranier Wolfcastle writ large during its' 90 minutes. Needless to say, if you prefer a plot, any degree of subtlety and realism  this really isn't going to be your cup of tea Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Colonel John Matrix, yes  the screenplay even resorts to giving his character a zingy surname is pursuit of the comic book action that this movie portrays. He was the head of an organisation called 'The Unit' before settling down for a the quiet life with his daughter. Of course, he isn't supposed to live for long as it turns out 'someone' is killing off members of 'The Unit', examples of which we see at the opening scenes of the film. Matrix's ex-boss fears the Colonel may be next.It turns out to be all a blag. 'Someone' is killing Matrix's team to flush him out and General Kirby has led that 'someone' straight to him. This 'someone' turns out to be General Arius, smarmy ex dictator of Val Verde who Matrix helped to overthrow. He has an offer for our hero: assassinate the democratically elected successor to Arius or lose his daughter who will be 'mailed back in pieces' if he doesn't cooperate.Being Arn-uld of course. He doesn't. He proceeds to take down the whole of the paramilitary organisation single handed, culminating in a firefight at the General's Doric style mansion. After cleaning up the baddies, he flies off to the horizon with his love interest and daughter in tow  the world safer due to the efforts of one man Clichéd, by the numbers stuff you might think. Right? Wrong!!'Commando' stands alone as one of the most overblown, frankly silly pieces of cinema which you will ever see. And this is the very reason why I love the film so much. Schwarzenegger started his nearly decade long winning run of wisecracking hard arses with Matrix. The body parts of who the camera lovingly paws before the opening titles, he is just HUGE! A paradoxical man who can kill someone with a shoulder barge, shows absolutely no trepidation in taking on a heavily fortified enemy stronghold single handed yet has a doting daughter (played by Alyssa Milano from Charmed) and is shown feeding a deer with her in the starting credits! Plus, this monosyllabic killing machine has the dry, cutting wisecracks of Oscar Wilde  c'mon.. who are the filmmakers trying to fool?? All the plot-holes (there are dozens of them) and shoddy production values simply add to the film's appeal. To pick two out of many): 1. Matrix jumps from the landing gear of a ascending airliner and falls maybe 80 feet into the marshland below. Cut to a slowly travelling double travelling slowly from about 20 feet into the same marshes 2. The Colonel plants several mines around the barracks of Arius's men before the final big assault: said barracks explode from the INSIDE when he presses the trigger! Its just laughable! The supporting cast are the bit part players you expect in an Ar-nuld extravaganza. James Olson plays General Franklin Kirby (pronounced 'Keurby' in Arnie's inimitable Austrian accent): a confused superior officer who spends most of his screen time looking confused upon discovering the carnage that his protégée causes. Love interest Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) is simply dragged along to flash her legs, whilst daughter Jenny ('Chenny') just provides annoyance value.It is amongst the baddies of the piece that the movie gains its' 'this movie is so terrible it is a work of genius' flavour. Dan Hedaya plays Arius, a man who projects his character simply with the power of his scowl. He has such a horribly forced Spanish accent that it would make Speedy Gonzales sound naturalistic. The other heavies are of little consequence, save Sully (David Patrick Kelly) a pint sized charming looking guy (emulating Face out of the A-Team perhaps?) with a terrible way with women (maybe not). The standout the bunch is Arnie's ultimate nemesis, Bennett played by Australian actor Vernon Wells. Think about it: your baddie is normally some swarthy Latino, urbane (yet psychopathic) European or mysterious Oriental type. A big fat Australian with Freddy Mercury moustache, leather trousers, chain mail and dog tags just isn't what you expect! He gets his fair share of panto villain one liners, often delivered in a sibilant whisper. In short, you would want to meet him down a dark alley.. but for slightly different reasons All of this silliness is backed by a soundtrack of original material written by James Horner  a man who graduated onto more epic fayre in Titanic and Apollo 13. He provides the synths, saxophones and steel drums designed to heighten the tension, but which end up sounding like elevator musak in the process.The 'special' features offered with Commando ( the trailer and, erm that it) add to the final paradox of this movie. Pay £5 for something that's cheap and tacky but so incredibly entertaining.. if its you're kind of thing of course Otherwise steer clear of it like the plague..",Commando

Bennett is the silliest bad guy to ever grace the big screen, not only is he small in stature, but he is the least intimidating bad guy ever.  Still he makes up for it, as you might guess, in his one-liners. If you want mindless action and unintentionally laughable humor, watch Commando and I GUARANTEE you will enjoy it.

However, this is my favorite movie because it is so bad it's funny! Bennett is like this Freddy Mercury guy in a chain mail vest that is somewhat attracted to Matrix. Arius is probably not really Mexican. Matrix survives two scenes that he would've died, where his car gets flipped over and where he jumps out of the plane without a parachute. He also killed probably about a billion men and was only shot twice. ""Your soldiers. They make me laugh. If Matrix were here, he would laugh too."" - Bennett. This movie is full of puns and bad sayings by both Matrix and Bennett. Some of my favs are ""Let off some steam Bennett!"" - John Matrix, the one I listed before, ""Hah! Your soldiers are nothing'! Matrix and I can kill every one of them :Bennett snaps; in the blink of an eye. Remember that."" Bennett. Overall, this movie is the funniest movie I've ever seen. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!",Commando

But the worst of all is the one at the end of the film ""let off some steam Bennett"".I also think Bill Duke is good as Cooke. I have thought since I watched it for the first time that Bennett looks like Freddie Mercury. This film was one of the first films made as Arnie the mega star being one year after The Terminator.

I mean seriously they must have either 1 - been high, 2 - been very lazy (it has a great number of flaws that i'm sure you will pick up on, my particular favourite is the crew's reflection showing up on the side of a car.), 3 - set out to reach the perfect equilibrium between action and spoof, which they delightfully achieve! or finally 4 - witnessed the hilarious acting qualities of Arnie and pretty much decided to dedicate a movie totally devoted to cheesy lines and unbelievable action which only Mr Schwarzenegger could deliver.You may consider my vote of 10 for this movie to be a bit high, i used to rate it as my favourite silly film but to be perfectly honest it is my favourite film. The film generally consists of John Matrix(seriously what a name!) as a retired Army colonel living with his daughter in a delightfully cheesy mountain town environment, then terror strikes! Jenni Matrix(the daughter) is kidnapped! The rest of the film consists of Arnie trying to rescue her...with hilarious results.The film is supported by a brilliant cast, only Arnie could pull off Matrix, and you should see some of the baddies! Oh my word! clearly mismatched against a multiple Mr universe, but they put up a good fight non the less. But the film is all really about Schwarzenegger, it showcases him in all his glory!To summarise, if you want to see a genuine action film don't go for this, but if you fancy a comedy that doesn't take itself serious and is very funny this is the best one out there. It is so silly and badly put together with some clear editing flaws but thats what makes it so brilliant! If your unsure just give the first ten minutes a watch, priceless!",Commando

Whether it's the cheesy dialogue; F*ck YOU, a**hole, the catchy soundtrack that doesn't seem to change for entire time, the ridiculously high body-count or the least threatening bad guy ever to hit the silver screen, you won't be bored for a second.The story as it goes; John Matrix(Arnold) daughter Jenny(Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped and the only way for him to ever see her again is to assassinate the president of fictional country Val Verde, so the former dictator Arius can reclaim his throne. Right?? WRONG!! John, as the ex-commando he is, kills the bad guy watching him and now has 11 hours to find a rescue little Jenny before she is killed or maybe worse. Standing between him and his goal is a 200 man or so, strong army, all led by the notorious Bennet(Vernon Wells), a former member of Johns commando unit.Arnold looks more buffed than ever, and his charisma and bad-ass attitude makes it impossible not to like his hero, and the carnage he lays upon the baddies haven't been seen since Godzilla stomped Japan to rubbles. When Arnie stands for the brutal action, the comedy lies on the not-so-broad shoulders of Vernon Wells. And god, does he deliver.

Always tease them with the cigarette the faggish grin and tease them by telling them they don't know what they're missing.The action is nonstop the humor bombarded consistently and an ending that will warm your heart. This film is tied with Predator as the greatest film ever. Stop reading this review and go watch this movie. Then watch it again and again and again.",Commando
422,atomic40,"Classic Action, Classic Arnold",8,10 January 2006,"This movie defines blown out 80s action flicks. Arnold mows down armies to achieve his goal and comes out only with a couple scratches. One liners abound that have made him so famous and a great villain in Bennett, played by Vernon Wells. This is not a movie to be taken seriously, and this is what makes is so enjoyable. Some memorable scenes include: ""Shopping"" Arnold breaks into a gun shop and discovers exactly where the button is to open up a vault full of automatic weapons and explosives ""Sully"" Dropping Sully off a cliff (and you can see the safety wire attached to Sully's leg ""Cooke"" Getting impaled on a wooden post ""Bennett"" Too many great scenes to list but getting skewered with a steaming pipe is great ""The Beach"" Arnold strapping himself up with machine guns, pistols, grenades, and a giant rocket launcher as he prepares to storm the island compound.Definitely a must see for Arnold fans.",Commando
423,N00DLE,The definitive Schwarzenegger film.,8,25 October 2008,"Unless you really have something against Arnold Schwarzenegger or mindless action films, you will definitely enjoy this film.Commando has all aspects of an Arnold film covered, mindless action, a simple (if not daft) plot, massive body count, hilarious one liners, and so long as you don't take it too seriously, a good way to spend 90 or so minutes.The plot is basically this: an ex-commando's daughter is kidnapped in a bid to make him assassinate a South American president, but as the ex-commando is Schwarzenegger, this isn't going to happen. I guarantee whatever you think an Arnold film is about, this has it.If you're lucky enough to catch Commando when it hasn't been chopped to pieces with re-edits for TV or DVD then it's a top-notch popcorn film that doesn't disappoint in the entertainment arena.The cast does a good job of making the non-action parts of the film believable, Rae Dawn Chong is good as Arnold's sort of sidekick, and Vernon Wells is great as a villain, even though he is ridiculously dressed! And Arnold does his job well as a one man army (especially against about 100 soldiers near the end of the film) All in all, great fun so long as you don't take it too seriously, you're not looking for any Oscar winners, and just want a good time in front of the box.",Commando
424,Superman_Is_Not_Depressed,He's not a special agent dummy,10,28 June 2009,"The name of the movie is Commando. He is a Commando. Not a special agent. Don't ever write a comment again. I Vorakam, lord of the Thundercats, command it.Jesus Christ. I have to write 10 lines of text just for this stupid comment to go through??? Blah blah blah. hmmm lets see what else can I write that will make this comment more poignant. Ah yes perhaps I shall regale you of a fond childhood story. One day I was playing with my transformer Bluestreak on the floor of my mothers living room. When I got up to go do something else. Lo and behold my father walks in and steps on Bluestreak crushing him into a hundred tiny little pieces. Needless to say I was devastated.",Commando
425,Beau_Roger,Arnold is God,10,11 March 2006,"This is truly a testament to Arnold Schwarzenegger's greatness, and just about sums up his entire movie career. Throughout his movies he singlehandedly defeated aliens, brought down evil corporations and terrorist organizations, destroyed robots sent from the future and killed numerous bad guys thus saving the world from a grim, grim fate. Hey, he even took down the devil (yes, God's nemesis) in one of his movies.If you want the whole essence of Arnold's movies summed up into one, then look no further than Commando, because if you add all Arnold flicks together and then divide them with the total number of movies, Commando will be the mean value.This is the movie that set the standard for B-flicks, and here Arnold is doing what he does best, killing. He plays a retired commando whose daughter is kidnapped by some fascist dictator that wants him to do a mission in exchange for her life. All it really does is give Arnold a excuse to kill people and wreak havoc, which he does, and does it well.The lines are cheesy, the plot and the ""twists"" pretty standard and somewhat melodramatic, but its still enjoyable and forgivable because we find John Matrix running around breaking necks and tossing phone booths and cars at people rest of the time, which is the remaining 90% of the movie. The other elements are simply there to give him a reason, and to be able to give the following moral lesson at the end: don't mess with Arnold or any of the characters he play.Most movies today just try too hard to be deep and innovative. Commando is the perfect film to watch if you are tired of all that. This movie has everything you want from a mindless action flick; hilarious one-liners, brutal kills, lots of explosions and a superhuman protagonist (in the beginning of the movie, he actually SMELLS the enemies coming). My hat of to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the greatest action hero ever.",Commando
426,simon-mundie,Superb,9,12 August 2005,"Commando is simply superb entertainment. Explaining why i love this film so much is difficult because i just don't know where to start. One of my favourite aspects of it is the two leading male protagonists- matrix and Bennett. Matrix (Arnie) is at his laughable best. This is surely the film from where the Simpsons creators came up with the idea for McBain. Bennett- his arch enemy who used to fight alongside Matrix, is so camp it's hilarious. He prances about saying he ""Eats Green Berets for breakfast"" wearing leggings whilst desperately trying to come to terms with his blatant homosexuality.There can be little doubt that this is one of the most quotable films in screen history, particularly when delivered in a laughable Austro-American accent. From ""let off some steam Bennett"" to ""you know i said i would kill you last? I lied"" it is good quality wholesome entertainment for all the family. Arnie is a one man army who, along with his Air Stewardess sidekick, is patently above the law (witness the blowing up of a police van) and who can jump out of a plane into Marshland and be right as rain. And the chemistry between Matrix (Arnie) and his daughter Chenny(Jenny) is so embarrassingly bad, it's good. This film is highly recommended. You will be laughing for hours.",Commando
427,abdullaharif-36320,Commano,10,28 October 2018,Commando is also one of my favorite best movie of child hood Arnold played a master peice in this movie I think it's all time favorite movie.,Commando
428,JohhnyMayhem,"Best Schwarzenegger film, ever.",10,8 November 2005,"It's an action film.. an 80's action film at that. So you can't exactly expect much in the way of plot. So hey, with that in mind, it's a great plot. Come and kidnap his girl.. so he must get her back! Rawr! And he certainly does. With gusto. And plenty of hilarious one liners, as only Schwarzenegger could deliver.Fans of this should see The Running Man. I find it sad how The Terminator gets so much attention.. but Commando and The Running Man, two of Arnold's best work, barely get any. I mean yeah, Terminator's obviously far better, but these other two are awesome in their own right.",Commando
429,goochtap,dip,10,12 May 2006,"That part where the guy says ""you f*cking wh*re"" was hilarious. Awesome action shows what Arnold can do. There was also the scene with the token big t*tty girl in the motel scene. I laughed and got pumped. Perfect movie.I watched this and wondered ""what other Arnold movies are this great?"" None, dude. Eraser was lame. SO was True Lies.Predator was on par with action and also had that one guy in it. Interesting dichotomy in which that same guy was a bad guy in this movie and a a good guy in Predator. He was also in Carwash, which was awesome.The guy who played Bennet was way too out of shape to be believable as a good antagonist. Arnold would have killed him in 5 seconds.Dan Hedeya had an awful accent.All in all, this was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",Commando
430,kokolima,Will he be back after this?,5,1 March 2006,"Every so often a movie comes along which has had a surprising amount of money thrown at it, a cast of well paid and big named actors, and enough special effects to make you think ""Wow, this movie must be good."" Commando, the latest film starring the larger-than-life alpha male Arnold Schwarzenegger as Commando John Matrix, is one of these movies.These movies can be either a huge success, such as last years Lethal Weapon starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover; or they can suffer from the 'Flop' effect. Unfortunately Commando suffers from this crippling and contagious disease that has been cutting a path through Hollywood these past few years. Ultimately the movie should have been good. During the opening few minutes of the movie you will see hit men fulfil their contracts on a few targets, which leaves the audience to question their motives. Opening with such a hook and jumping head first into the action is a good idea when it comes to action movies, so what went wrong? The scene then switches to our hero, a heavily built man (guess who) chopping wood in the middle of the Californian Mountains. Cliché? Maybe, but it is nothing compared to the disgustingly cheesy following minutes of Matrix and his daughter doing many household family things, such as playing in the pool, and eating ice-cream. The scene only destroys everything that the budding teenage boys, sitting on the edge of their seats looking forward to Arnie snapping necks hoped for. All in the opening few minutes! The movie then takes a drastic turn with the kidnapping of his daughter Jenny, and the slaughter of all who stand between Matrix and his daughter. Along the way he runs into Cindy, played by Rae Dawn Chong, and effectively kidnaps her at first, however as the story progresses she begins to assist him getting his daughter back. What the movie does have going for it is characters; each one of the characters have their own personal touch and idiolect, with characters such as Cindy adding comic effect, Bennett being the twisted killer with a haunted past, and Cooke, the token ""hard man"" who ends up having a fantastic fist fight with Arnold. The reason for the characters being so excellently created is down to having two of the most fantastic writers in the business behind the movie, Jeph Loeb and Matthew Weisman are both acclaimed comic book writers (partly the reason the characters are so larger than life), and both have experience in the movie industry.However, the reason all of the characters are so likable is not because they are believable, there is even a few examples of the poorest acting I have even seen in this movie. For instance Bennett; played by Vernon Wells. You can't help but feel he auditioned for the wrong movie, for one he doesn't look even half as intimidating as he should, and two you get a constant sense of familiarity with the time your dad dressed up in army gear for fancy dress one year. In the ending stages of the movie, we get to a climactic showdown between Bennett and Matrix, one which the audience have been waiting for the entire movie, and one which the audience know is going to happen at one point or another. Now this ending fight scene has all the marks of a great conflict, great choreography, script, and it generates a great atmosphere; but this is where the problem hits you in the face like one of Matrix's punches. Bennett is about five foot ten, around twelve stone and has a beer belly; practically no muscle at all. Matrix (being played by Arnie) is six foot two, weighs god-knows how much, and is possibly the most muscle bound man you'll ever see. For some strange reason, the fight evens out, and Matrix nearly looses! It leaves you to question the director of casting, and makes you want to check if they are in fact a monkey.So, the casting is to be frank, poor. However that isn't the only reason the movie is bad, looking closer there are so many goofs and mess ups it is ridiculous. The part where Matrix rams Sully off the road, then hi-jacks his car for instance. At one point there is damage to the side of the car, the next it a brand new side panel. Then in another scene we see Matrix plant bombs around a building then detonate them from a distance, the explosions quite clearly come from inside the buildings. This isn't just me being pedantic; this is painfully obvious to anyone.The one thing that could save this movie is strangely all of the points that I have listed above. Commando could be a rare gem that uses all of its flaws for a different purpose than intended, more or less as if the directors got lucky, and their ignorance paid off. That purpose would be comedy, and general entertainment. It is in fact confusing to tell if this is a bad movie, or genius in terms of pure entertainment. This film contains all the elements of a great movie, but they aren't used in an artistic or even professional way, they have almost accidentally come together in an aesthetically pleasing way.Commando does fall into the category of 'Brainless Action' but this is what people are going to come to see. Only the box office will tell if it does fall into the Flop category, as predicted. Personally I hated it well at least I think I did.Harvey Quinn (I did this review for my English coursework, thought i'd post it here)",Commando
