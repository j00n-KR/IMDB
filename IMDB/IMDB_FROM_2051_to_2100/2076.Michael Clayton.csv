0,MartinHafer,A bit slow...stick with this one.,8,29 May 2018,"""Michael Clayton"" is an extremely slow movie that is well worth seeing. So please resist the urge to turn off the movie...I felt a bit like doing this early on in the story.Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a fixer...a lawyer whose job it is to make clients' problems disappear. So, it's obvious early on that he is NOT a nice guy...not the sort of person you'd expect to be a hero. Add to that his huge gambling debts and you've got a really screwed up man. When he becomes involved in a case where his law firm is representing a chemical company in a class action lawsuit, however, his malleable morals are challenged. Is there something he won't hide?This is a good movie that was nominated for several Oscars and one one for Tilda Swinton for Best Supporting Actress. Well, while the film is good, I can only assume it was a slow year. Yes...it's good. But a Best Picture nominee? And Swinton's performance, though good, was relatively small for the Best Supporting Actress statuette. Still, it is good....just don't expect it's great...which all the nominations would seem to imply.By the way, one of the little things about the film I loved was the scene where Clayton needed to kick in a door. Unlike most TV shows and movies, it took a LOT of repeated effort to kick the door off the frame...an unusually realistic scene indeed.",Michael Clayton
1,bkoganbing,The law firm's janitor,8,10 November 2016,"In the title role of Michael Clayton, George Clooney is described by himself as exactly that. Whenever there's a big mess he's the one they send in to clean it up. The law firm under managing partner Sydney Pollack has a real mess on his hands. One of the firm's top attorneys Tom Wilkinson has gone off the deep end. He's representing a chemical company accused of poisoning people with a new insecticide they've developed. Cleaning up this mess might be just a baby sitting job with Wilkinson who mentored Clayton. But it has the potential to be worse because this company is guilty as sin and will do anything to limit the liability and keep their good name.Michael Clayton was nominated for a flock of Oscars including Best Actor for George Clooney as a much flawed hero. Takes a while for the better angels of Clooney's nature emerge. Tom Wilkinson as the lawyer with both conscience and schizophrenia steals the acting honors though. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Michael Clayton got a flock of other nominations including Best Picture.The film did take home one bit of Oscar gold. Tilda Swinton as one of the chemical company executives who also has an attack of conscience got a Best Supporting Actress Award. She's quite good herself.The film is an interesting look at big business and the high priced lawyers they must retain to keep them out of trouble. Sad in some cases we have to rely on consciences coming to the fore for any justice at times.Michael Clayton, a well done piece of cinema.",Michael Clayton
2,SnoopyStyle,Juicy dense dialog crackles,8,6 January 2014,"Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a fixer for a big law firm. His own personal life is a mess. Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) is one of the firm's top lawyer working six years straight on a defense for a damaging pesticide. He breaks down and goes off in a deposition. Clayton is sent in to clean up the mess. Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) is newly promoted in U/North which makes the pesticide. She is surprised that a low ranking lawyer has been sent to fix the mess.There is a lot of juicy dense dialog for these great actors to chew on. The atmosphere just crackles with energy. George Clooney is dead on as the morally questionable lead. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as the mentally disturbed lawyer who finally cracks under the weight of the damage. Clooney's scene with his boss Sydney Pollack is electric. Tilda Swinton is convincing as a new executive over her head. This is an actors' picture, and they all did great work here.",Michael Clayton
3,Hitchcoc,It Grabs Your Attention and Hangs On,9,18 December 2009,"George Clooney is a treasure. He's one of the few actors any one of us could sit down and have a drink with and not be intimidated. He has a casual charm and wonderful, natural presence. In this he is portraying a guy who knows how to fix things. His company occasionally is able to play fast and loose with the system and get people off that don't deserve it. He is tiring of this and eventually finds himself in the middle of an effort to put the stops on a good friend who has discovered some shady dealings. It is a pharmaceutical company and they don't want the public to know the implications of what they are peddling. I won't get into the complex plot. Let it be said that Clooney locks horns with Tilda Swenson, his driven adversary and her henchmen. It is a thriller that works with Clooney understated and puzzled and then, when he becomes the target, really ticked. Watch this. Swenson is great as the edgy, ""how-did-get-in- so-deep character. Everything is out there for us to see and it's very entertaining.",Michael Clayton
4,claudio_carvalho,"Good, But Overrated Thriller",7,5 April 2008,"In New York, the divorced attorney Michael Clayton (George Clooney) has been working for many years fixing messy situations for the law firm Kenner, Back and Odeen. He has never been invited to become a partner due to his conflictive personality of poker gambler and alcoholic that left him completely broken. Michael's addicted brother owes a high amount to a dangerous loan shark and Michael is trying to find a means to cover the debts. When the brilliant attorney Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) that has been ahead of the U-North case, a complicated three billion dollars lawsuit, for six years has a nervous breakdown and is arrested naked in a parking area in Milwaukee, Michael tries to help his friend, and is involved in an evil scheme plotted by Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), the legal counsel of U-North.The low-paced ""Michael Clayton"" is a good but overrated thriller tailored for George Clooney, who is perfect performing his complex and ambiguous character. I believe that the excessive nominations to the Oscar show the lack of good movies in Hollywood. The excellent actress Tilda Swinton has another excellent performance in the role of the villain Karen Crowder. However, I am not sure whether I was not paying much attention, but I found the screenplay confused and in the end something was missing to make ""Michael Clayton"" a great movie. Further, I did not understand the need of a bomb in Michael's car; the killers were very effective and why using a sophisticated electronic apparatus to kill the attorney? My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Conduta de Risco"" (""Conduct of Risk"")",Michael Clayton
5,kosmasp,Almost too much,9,5 August 2008,"But only almost. I'm referring to the plot/information given in this movie. It's not a movie that you can pop in your DVD player or go to a cinema to watch in Fast Food style/kind of way. You have to commit your whole concentration on this movie and you won't be disappointed by it!Apart from the complex story (which is not too complex, in other words, you can understand it at the first time you watch the movie, even if it takes almost up til the end of the movie) and the great cast (see cast list here on IMDb and they're all bringing their ""A"" game so to speak), you will be amazed by the wonderful score and the amazing cinematography. It's beautifully shot and edited. If you like your drama(-thriller) with subtext, this is the one to see!",Michael Clayton
6,classicsoncall,"""This is the guy they send? Who is this guy?""",9,16 October 2017,"Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a 'fixer'. He fixes other people's messes. If he can't do it himself, he knows who to get in touch with. In a gangster film, he might have been a 'cleaner', removing the stench and debris of a hit once a job took place. The movie actually has a couple of cleaners who double as electronics experts and private detectives. They're not nice guys, they can be persuaded to take out anyone if the price is right, as long as there's no ambiguity in the assignment.This is a finely woven story, intricately plotted and told in somewhat of a flashback style until prior events catch up with real time right after Clayton's car is blown up. I don't understand the reviewers who claim that they couldn't follow the story, it's actually laid out pretty well. I've said it before, sometimes paying attention goes a long way. This film is certainly not as complex as Clooney's 2005 film ""Syriana"", so if you had trouble with this one, don't even bother with the earlier picture.One thing I didn't get though, and I WAS paying attention, was why Michael would have sicced his eight year old son on Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) to instruct him in the Conquest role playing game. That didn't connect with anything, other than Arthur's own descent into delusion while refusing to take his medication. Also, I thought the story line could have done a better job of fleshing out Arthur's relationship with Anna (Merrit Wever), one of the U/North plaintiffs. Did Arthur see her as a romantic interest, or was he solely disgusted with the cover up of U/North's toxic culcitate and the lethal damage their clients were exposed to? In the end I guess it doesn't matter, but it might have explained his paranoia a bit better.On a personal level, what I found particularly interesting were some of the filming locations which were used in the environs outside New York City. That view of the overhead rail trestle near the spot where Michael stopped to view the horses is along a stretch of country road near Salisbury Mills, New York; it's known as the Moodna Viaduct and serves as a commuter and transport line. The house where Michael's brother Gene (Sean Cullen) lived is located in the Worley Heights section of Monroe, New York, about a ten minute drive from the trestle. And director/screenwriter Tony Gilroy slipped in a reference to Washingtonville Central as the place where Michael Clayton went to high school, but it's his own Alma mater! All are located in Orange County, New York where I've lived all my life, so that was like getting a bonus while watching a picture that was already entertaining on it's own merits.",Michael Clayton
7,gavin6942,"When Your Client is In Trouble, Call in the Fixer",8,5 April 2008,"Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a ""fixer"", a janitor that cleans up legal messes. If your client makes a mistake, he erases the mistake. But this time Clayton is in over his head... an ""evil"" corporation has been poisoning consumers and will do just about anything to keep its secret memos secret. Whose side will Michael be on -- the side of his client or the side of the public good? ""Michael Clayton"" might be a film one needs to watch twice. Starting four days in the future, and then going back to the beginning, not all of the story is unraveled in linear order. It's not confusing, but it's complex... many characters, many motives and motivations. Clayton himself is complex -- a father, a lawyer, a fixer, a gambler. We get only glimpses of each and have to draw our own conclusions about the big picture. But sometimes less is more, and this is one of those times. Not everything needs to be laid out. (In some respects, this makes ""Clayton"" like Clooney's earlier film ""Syriana"", though it's not nearly as intricate as the latter.) Tilda Swinton won best supporting actress at the Oscars for her role as the corporation's lawyer. I'm torn on that. She is a great actress. Though I found her role to be quite small, hardly even ""supporting"". Clooney was incredible (as he always is) and the ensemble is all quite good. The blend of drama, suspense and a bit of a thriller (though just a ""bit""), everything seems to go together so very well.But again, maybe watch this twice for the full effect. Many things won't make sense the first time, at least not right away. Why are plaintiffs being called at home? What is the significance of the fantasy novel? How did the one attorney get the child's phone number? These are things you'll be wondering. And you really should watch this film so you can wonder them. One of 2007's best.",Michael Clayton
8,lee_eisenberg,vile people in the world,8,18 July 2009,"After George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh collaborated on ""Syriana"", which focused on a world of completely evil individuals, they then collaborated on ""Michael Clayton"", focusing on equally vile people. In this case, Clooney plays a man employed by firm and given the job of ""fixer"", meaning that he intervenes whenever the firm needs good PR. But when a former colleague (Tom Wilkinson) blows the lid on a case involving agrochemicals, things won't be so easy.What is important to understand about the topics depicted in movies like ""Traffic"" and ""Michael Clayton"" is that they are among the slimiest cultures in the world. And the movie does a very good - if unpleasant - job showing that. Nasty as the characters are, one realizes that they can only do their job (or so it seems). All in all, I definitely recommend this movie, and I will be very eager to see another Clooney-Soderbergh collaboration like this, if there is one.Also starring Tilda Swinton and Sydney Pollack (who died a few months after the release).",Michael Clayton
9,jboothmillard,Michael Clayton,6,5 March 2009,"Directed by Oscar nominated Tony Gilroy, screenplay writer for The Bourne Trilogy, it might have sounded interesting, and I looked forward to seeing the award-winning actress in action, but it wasn't quite what I had in mind. Basically, Michael Clayton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated George Clooney) is a Mr. Fix-It guy in a law firm, and after his car blows up, it flashes back four days where he owes a loan shark, and his firm is trying to negotiate in a high-stakes merge. Firm senior partner Arthur Edens (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Tom Wilkinson) has a nervous breakdown while taking a lawsuit, ahead of the U-North case, oh, and not much later he kills himself. Oh, and Karen Crowder (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Tilda Swinton) plans an evil scheme in this U-North case. Okay, I'll be completely honest, I lost track of what was going on and couldn't keep up. Also starring Sydney Pollack as Marty Bach, Michael O'Keefe as Barry Grissom, Sean Cullen as Det. Gene Clayton, Ken Howard as Don Jefferies, Denis O'Hare as Mr. Greer, Robert Prescott as Mr. Verne and Austin Williams as Henry Clayton. It is when I lost track that I just spent the rest of the film paying more attention to the performance from Swinton, I can see reasons why she won the Oscar, and I guess she deserved it. Even though I din't get it, the performances are good, and there are bits and pieces to catch your eye, like the car explosion, but I can't see myself watching it again, unless I wanted to actually try and understand it, which I'm not all keen on doing. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Music, Original Score for James Newton Howard, and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Tony Gilroy, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Good, in my opinion!",Michael Clayton
10,rmax304823,Shiva Wrecks High-Class Law Firm.,8,21 September 2008,"This movie is written and directed by Tony Gilroy and stars George Clooney as a ""fixer"" at a big law firm. Clooney is under a lot of pressure. He owes eighty large he borrowed to open a restaurant. On top of that, the best lawyer in his firm, a friend, played by Tom Wilkinson, goes bananas during a taped deposition, tears his clothes off on tape, and disappears. Clooney is called in by another friend and mentor, Sidney Pollack, to find Wilkinson and cool him out. Wilkinson may have been driven mad by the knowledge that a corporation he's been defending has been knowingly adding a carcinogen to its fertilizer. Meanwhile, another high-echelon employee, Tilda Swinton, hires a goon squad who kill Wilkinson with ease. When Clooney finds out about the carcinogen, they set out to explode his car to prevent his going public.It all sounds formulaic, doesn't it? Mad man in powerful position. Bad guys pursuing good guys -- goal, murder? Conspiracy to keep dangerous secrets at high levels? But this isn't the typical sort of by-the-numbers chase thriller that a summary of the plot suggests. In fact, it's pretty good at just about all levels.Take Tom Wilkinson, the lawyer who turns psychotic and threatens the firm he works for. What an opportunity for directorial razzle-dazzle. Black-and-white images lasting a few seconds and accompanied by ripping, zapping noises on the sound track. Portentous announcements -- ""We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore!"" Instead, the scenes involving Wilkinson, even at his most manic, are shot in a classical style. And Wilkinson's performance is convincing. The writer, Gilroy, and the actor, Wilkinson, do a good job of showing what a combination of exaltation, irritation, and poor judgment a manic episode is. And thank God for antipsychotics because fifty years ago the psychiatric hospitals were full of patients who couldn't stop shouting from tables and falling off.Clooney, too, gives a top-notch dramatic performance, low-keyed. If we expect a stereotype -- Richard Gere pounding on things with his Power Drumsticks and pacing restlessly about -- we don't get it. We see a thoughtful guy as well as an ambitious and worried one. Tilda Swinton is a good actress, and without being stunningly gorgeous either. Her character is effectively shown as arid, ambitious, and ruthless as hell.There isn't a high-speed car chase in the film. No guns at all. No fireballs. (A car DOES explode -- but it's miles away and, awesomely, the flash arrives before the sound.) The murder is over with in a jiffy and there isn't a drop of blood. No sex either. Sorry.Nicely done by all concerned. I don't know if the kids will enjoy it if they've gotten used to more shocking material.",Michael Clayton
11,Tweekums,A gripping thriller,8,29 October 2017,"Michael Clayton is a fixer at a major New York law firm; in the opening scenes we see him receive a phone call asking him to help deal with a client involved in a hit-and-run case. Shortly after meeting the man he is driving along and stops to stretch his legs and admire some horses it is lucky that he did as his car explodes! We then jump back four days. His firm is representing a major agricultural supply company that is being sued in a class action case because one of its products was carcinogenic Arthur Edens, the senior lawyer in charge of the case, had a manic episode while talking to one of the claimants and got undressed! Michael brings Arthur back to New York; Arthur is rambling about the firm being on the wrong side; there is evidence that the company knew their product was dangerous and did nothing to stop it. With a potential multi-billion dollar pay-out being sought the company is prepared to do just about anything so Arthur and Michael are soon in real danger.This is an impressive thriller; the introduction nicely makes us think the film will be about a slightly sleazy lawyer trying to get a wealthy client off a hit and run case before showing him telling the man that he isn't the person for the job; perhaps he isn't so sleazy; then the explosion makes one wonder just what he is caught up in by now I was gripped. The main story of a corporation that puts profit before people may not be the most original but that doesn't matter it provides a good reason to give us a gripping story. The subplot involving money Clayton owed did feel a little superfluous but it could be argued that it made him slightly more open to corruption; something that matters towards the end. Tension is fairly high throughout; once we've seen the explosion we know that there are very dangerous people involved. The cast does a fine job; George Clooney is on great form as the eponymous Michael Clayton and Tilda Swinton is solid as the general counsel of the agricultural company. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Overall this is a solid thriller for those wanting tension without shootouts and frequent explosions.",Michael Clayton
12,moonspinner55,A film consumed by the overwhelming sensation of deliberately-dislocating confusion...,4,6 August 2014,"Literate, handsomely-produced and well-acted, writer-director Tony Gilroy's ""Michael Clayton"" still fails to ignite as a corporate-corruption melodrama for our times. The film has all the ingredients for the kind of prestigious insider exposé which usually wins awards, however the returns are too overtly obtuse to succeed as a delicious suspense story. George Clooney plays Michael, an attorney with personal haunts who also works as an in-house ""janitor"" (i.e., clean-up man) for a major New York City law-firm dealing with two baffling cases: the manic-depressive breakdown of a colleague who knows too many insider secrets and a client being sued over the effects of a carcinogenic garden spray. Gilroy loads the picture up with key-points (cancer, addiction, assassination, corporate merger) without finding a way to make his characters interesting for the audience. Viewers are tipped early they should be aesthetically turned-on by the picture's firebrand intelligence, which doubles as sort of a serious form of 'movie art', yet only Tilda Swinton's Oscar-winning performance as a desperate legal counselor manages to make an impact. Framing the narrative in flashback mode (going back four days in time after an explosive incident) is infuriating, and expectations dwindle from there. *1/2 from ****",Michael Clayton
13,blanche-2,Excellent film but not everybody's cup of tea,8,22 March 2008,"George Clooney is ""Michael Clayton"" in this 2007 film about a man with the somewhat thankless job of putting out fires for his legal firm. There are several plot lines, making this film more interesting and complicated than many that have been released in recent years. People will be disappointed in it for that reason. However, its denseness is what makes it absorbing as the audience attempts to figure out what's going on. It also makes the movie a little uneven, particularly after the opening sequence. It's one of those films you have to stick with if you want a payoff.Michael Clayton has the burden of problems in his job and in his own life. He's a compulsive gambler just for one. He has a thief for a brother who destroyed a business he and Michael were partners in and left Michael in terrible debt. Michael also has a young son and is trying to cope with a deterioration in his relationship with his ex-wife.The main problem Clayton is assigned to concerns a billion dollar corporate case, over which the senior partner, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has gone bonkers, literally, having discovered evidence that the firm they represent, U/North, had blatant disregard for human life. The corporate attorney for U/North is Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), who will stop at nothing to keep the unbalanced Eden from exposing them.The most interesting thing about the film is the juxtaposition between Eden and Clayton as it asks the question - what's more important, your principles or your job security? Edens can no longer sacrifice his principles, and it drives him mad; Michael hates his job but, faced with enormous debt, believes he has to suppress his true feelings. The character of Karen, on the other hand, doesn't bother herself with these big questions. She has to win at all costs.The acting is fantastic, Wilkinson having the hardest role and also the most thankless. He's crazy but there's a reason for it. George Clooney is magnificent, the camera unforgiving on his face as it shows his sadness, his cynicism and his exhaustion. This is a star whose persona we know is full of humor, outspokenness, elegance and charm, yet here he foregoes the star qualities and buries himself in depression. Swinton is brilliant - the emotions in her final scene are quite amazing and, having witnessed something similar myself - right on.A dark, complicated, character-driven, uneven film, the kind you don't see much of anymore.",Michael Clayton
14,Quinoa1984,"""I am Shiva, the God of Death""",10,16 October 2007,"So are spoken as some of the most desperate words- not crazy, there's a difference- in recent movie memory. Michael Clayton is about the character trying to deal with his hand of fate, which is pretty dire: he's 45, working for 17 years for a law-firm where he's a ""fixer"", cleaning up the problems that can't be solved through simple litigations. Now he has a problem with the chief attorney, the ""legend"" Arthur (Tom Wilkinson) who has just gone streaking after one of the witnesses in a parking lot. The whole case could fall apart, but is there more than meets the eye? Murder, wire-taps, cover-ups, bombs, and at the core the placidity of a straight-laced face (Tilda Swinton), are all apart of the not-too-complicated puzzle.It goes without saying that there is a little more than some debt that Gilroy owes to Network, if only in the face-value to be taken from the characters: the weathered professional, the nut who really has ecstatic truth in the Herzog sense, the cold and exacting woman, and the guy working as a top dog behind the scenes. But where Network was as dark as satires get, if there's any laughter to come out of Michael Clayton it's only in the extremely uncomfortable moments of Wilkinson walking in a daze through Times Square or disrobing maniacally on video, or a couple of chuckles at the wrap-up climax. It's a paranoid thriller where, in reality, it's not exactly paranoia in the strictest sense: if it's really happening, then it shouldn't be something to watch out for. But Gilroy continues to build on a sensibility of paranoia, of the darkness creeping up behind the corporate facade, of the sinister presence of those men in cars and vans with total access to whatever and whenever with the target. And you thought the Bourne movies- co-written by Gilory- were tense genre pieces.What makes a film like Michael Clayton end up as memorable as it is, almost essential for those wanting to go to the movies for a serious drama without pretense or extreme melodrama, is the script and the performances. It's indeed such a strong script that it surely covers over the direction- as a directorial debut it feels like the work of a professional with countless years behind the belt, with a few notes of experimentation (the opening rambling voice-over on the looming, still shots of the empty rooms at the office at night, and the final shot as something that breaks away from what could be a bit more predictable and instead kind of haunting). And it's something as literate as this that allows for actors to go for what they can do best: for Wilkinson, Oscar worthy to a T, it's both subtle and over-the-top with Arthur, at one point making a masterful stroke of carrying loaves of bread; Swinton makes the careful act of preparation and looking at a mirror like it's everything to the character; Pollack, solid as usual, not too much to say.Then there's Clooney. Already one of those leading men in Hollywood that has enough clout to probably get Sim City made into a movie if he wanted to, when given a serious and complex enough part to dive into (which has been frequent lately save for the Ocean movies) he's near perfect. I love seeing him on the brink of exploding at Arthur when he first sees him going on and on in the prison cell, or when he levels with his kid about his druggie-bum brother, or just in the way he looks frightened and unsure at some horses in a field. And the aforementioned shot couldn't be done so well by anyone else- you don't want to leave the theater even as the credits roll by, because he might do something, something slight behind the usual super-handsome exterior as he leaves the audience wanting to see more. It's an excellent genre film, but it's probably one of the few near perfect performances of the actor's career (and yes, I include Return of the Killer Tomatoes in that group).",Michael Clayton
15,tavm,Michael Clayton was one critically acclaimed film I couldn't go for,3,16 July 2008,"I guess Michael Clayton is what I'd call a ""critic's picture"" meaning one that gets lots of critical acclaim but does nothing for the public. The film, written and directed by Tony Gilroy, seems to heading toward a kind of thriller premise but there's only one car explosion that doesn't kill anybody and is not followed by a chase scene. In fact, it's mostly talking that seems expository related with no big payoff at least until the end and by that time you're just glad it's all over. I mean, George Clooney, Tom Wilkerson, Oscar winning Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack in one of his last roles seem compelling with the lines they're given and direction they're taking but I kept fighting sleep with the slow and measured tone Gilroy was giving throughout. In summation, I'll just say that Michael Clayton is not for everyone's taste and it certainly wasn't for mine.",Michael Clayton
16,edwagreen,Michael Miserable Clayton *,1,1 November 2007,"The plot in this very hard film to follow or comprehend is just beyond belief.The only redeeming quality here is a genuine terrific performance by Tom Wilkinson in a supporting role as a lawyer with a mental problem.Otherwise, you can totally forget this awful production. Clooney and Sydney Pollack have never been worse in a film. Pollack just repeats his lines as if he is reading them. There is very little emotion on his part. What did the hit and run driver at the beginning of the film have to do with the rest of the story? The story-line is so muddled.We all know that we have to watch out for crooked lawyers but this is beyond belief.Clooney's life in this film is one big mess and the film emulates that.

I just thought this film dragged on and on and on. I was wanting to be thrilled and maybe excited...neither happened for me. Sorry George, sometimes a movie just goes flat.

Anytime one of their clients has a problem, preferably big, Clayton is called on to put a spin on the circumstances and get trouble solved with little or no publicity.One of the firm's premiere attorneys(Tom Wilkinson) goes a little nuts and strips in the middle of a deposition. Clayton is sent to find out what caused such a display. He decides it was just a matter of the attorney getting off of his medications.

18,sunwarrior13,Talky But Excellent Film,10,3 December 2011,"Michael Clayton is a legal thriller chronicles the attempts by attorney to cope with a colleague's apparent mental breakdown, and the corruption and intrigue surrounding a major client of his law firm being sued in a class action case over the effects of toxic agrochemicals.It features George Clooney in the title role as Michael Clayton together with Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton and Sydney Pollack.It was written and directed by Tony Gilroy,who is making his directorial debut for this picture.In the storyline,Michael Clayton handles all of the dirty work for a major New York law firm, arranging top-flight legal services and skirting through loopholes for ethically questionable clients. But when a fellow ""fixer"" decides to turn on the very firm they were hired to clean up for, Clayton finds himself at the center of a conspiratorial maelstrom. Once an ambitious D.A., Clayton is now a shell of his former dynamic self, thanks to a divorce, an unfortunate business venture, and astronomical debt. Though he longs to leave the cutthroat, ethically dubious world of corporate law behind, Clayton's poor financial situation and devotion to firm head Marty Bach leave him little choice but to remain on the job and tough it out. Meanwhile, litigator Karen Crowder finds her entire company's future hinging on the outcome of a multi-billion-dollar settlement overseen by Clayton's friend, star lawyer Arthur Edens. When Edens snaps and decides to blow the whistle on the questionable case, sabotaging the defense, Clayton must decide between his loyalty and his conscience.Tony Gilroy's film is a different kind of legal thriller.It is more about dialogues and conversations rather than action sequences.But it is also an outstanding movie about lawyers that would be comparable to the great one in its genre like of Absence Of Malice and The Verdict - which is more about morality in the practice of the profession.Definitely,it is smart and exciting especially with the intriguing characters involved in it.But nevertheless,one has to have 100% attention to fully understand and appreciate this film.But nevertheless,it is engrossing and entertaining that is not short in tension and suspense. The performances are great starting from Clooney in the title role as Michael Clayton together with Wilkinson,who portrayed a lawyer who is suffering a mental breakdown named Arthur Edens and Swinton,who portrayed litigator Karen Crowder. The screenplay was superb. Credit goes to Gilroy,who has proved once again that he can deliver the goods in giving great scripts. And most of all,Gilroy's directorial debut proves that he can be one of the best after getting an Oscar nod for direction in this film.This is one film that one should not miss especially for viewers who seek intelligent movies with great stories and memorable characters.",Michael Clayton

What also Surprises is that the Tone of the Film is Low-Key and completely Character Driven, Although the Plot is as Topical and Important as they come.It's Complex (divert the eyes during one key scene and the reason and meaning of the important horse scene is lost in ether). The Actors are all on the same Wavelength and Contribute equally to the Film's enormous Critical Approval. The Writing is Profound, Philosophical, and Touching, with razor Sharp Wit and Symbolism.Every Character is Flawed (save the yet to grow up child) and show Dual and Destructive Behavior. But Each Personality makes its Mark and Lingers. The Movie Haunts. It Enters the Psyche and will Not Leave until You Give it its Due.The People that brought You this decidedly Different Masterpiece of Movie Making are Writer/Director Tony Gilroy, Indelible Screen Performances from George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack and Supporting Roles that every Actor Nailed.A Welcome, Against the Grain Film that Restores the thing that the most Popular form of Entertainment in modern History can be at its Best.

20,dbborroughs,Good performances are hurt by a contrived plot,7,1 January 2008,"George Clooney is Michael Clayton, fixer for a big New York law firm. As talk of a merger is leaving Clayton with an uncertain future, his plans to open a bar as an escape are sinking. As doubts about the future mount his firm needs him to bail out and rein in a litigation partner who's gone crazy and who is threatening to blow a massive class action settlement and suit.Unfortunately there are other forces at work...Clooney has been picked as an Oscar favorite for his work here and I'm pretty sure that his work will probably get a nomination. Its quite good, especially in the second half of the film. I'd like to put Sydney Pollack up for a nomination as well as a neat little turn as the law firm founding partner and watchman over Clayton. He's the right mix of friend and foe that many law firm partners have. Its clear that he is both a slime and a good guy, depending upon which end of his life you end up on. Its a nice performance that is too good to get lost (which it will if people don't mention it).The film itself is good but not great. Its a solid little story that thinks its more clever than it is. Well made its not really well plotted. Its not the burnout uncertainty story line thats the problem is the Tilda Swinton/dark forces storyline. Its at this point I run into a problem in that in order to discuss the flaws of the film I have to discuss the details of the plot. Unfortunately in order to do so would kind of make seeing the film redundant, so I won't since this is worth seeing somewhere other than at a full movie theater price.Suffice to say that some of what happens happens only to drive the plot and to get to the conclusion.I like the film but dislike the contrived nature of the story line.

Plot-wise it could spot a pretzel ten points and, as someone has already pointed out, you need to pay attention otherwise you'll wind up floundering out of your depth.

This is his debut in that chair, and he penned it as well, excellent idea since his scripts are what he's known and loved for. The concept is marvelous, and truly terrifying and interesting, especially if it's similar to the truth, which it may very well be. Clooney portrays a ""fixer"", an individual who ""cleans up"" after a law firm's clients if or when they get into a situation that can get them into legal trouble. The plot is engaging and develops very nicely throughout. Every single acting performance is spot-on. The characters are well-written, credible and psychologically accurate. This is astoundingly realistic, and not just ""for a Hollywood flick"". The cinematography and editing are amazing. On the DVD are alternate scenes with a commentary, and there's one for the film, as well, both are with Tony and John(his brother, who cut the feature), and they're all well worth the time.

He refers to himself as a ""janitor.""His skills, his ability to fix, and his conscience were put to the test when longtime colleague Arthur (Tom Wilkinson) snapped while working on a big case for an agricultural client named U North. Arthur's behavior and sentiments threatened the entire case for his firm's largest client. Clayton was called upon to reel him in and do damage control. In doing so Clayton stumbled upon more than he bargained for.""Michael Clayton"" was suspenseful even if it was nebulous at times. Clayton's character was a bit mysterious. Between his job at the firm, his family life, and his personal life, it wasn't entirely clear what was all going on with him.

He plays Michael Clayton, fixer for a big time law firm acting as a defendant in a class action law suit leveled at the cancer-causing conglomerate. When his good friend and the lead attorney assigned to building the defense (Tom Wilkinson, excellent) goes off his rocker and starts babbling about the evils of what he's been aiding and abetting, and even begins to help the prosecution with its case, Michael is called in to ""fix"" the situation. But he of course suffers a crisis of conscience when it turns out that his crazy friend is the only sane person around, and it becomes his job to make sure the corporation doesn't get away with its dastardly deeds.""Michael Clayton"" is well acted and written, but it's awfully dour and gloomy. Every movie like this has a big payoff scene at the end, where our hero gets to tell off the corporate jerk to the rousing applause of the audience (""Erin Brockovich"" consisted of nothing but scenes like that), and this movie is no exception. However, the one here is relatively muted, and we're not allowed to enjoy it for long. The final shot of the film is of Michael's face driving away from the big showdown in a cab, and it's not wearing an expression of triumph. It's the face of a man who's been worn out by the injustice of life, and I don't know that I've ever seen Clooney look worse on screen (though I hope that the bags under my eyes look as good as his). The film suggests that facing the evils of the world and doing the right thing can still hollow you out inside. This approach makes the movie better than a film like ""Erin Brockovich,"" but it may disappoint people who come into it thinking they're going to get to enjoy two hours of George Clooney telling people what's what.Along with Clooney and Wilkinson, the fine cast features Tilda Swinton, lips so thin they're practically non-existent, as the uptight corporate bitch who gets her comeuppance; and Sydney Pollack as head of Michael's law firm.Grade: A-",Michael Clayton
27,ferguson-6,Good will Janitor,6,14 October 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. It is very rare for a first time director to score a cast like this. But then, Tony Gilroy is not the typical first time director, having made his name through writing some hits like the ""Bourne"" series and ""Armageddon"". Evidently he spent much more time on his directing than his writing for this project. I was just amazed at the simplicity of the story. For two hours this film looks and acts all serious and intricate, when in fact, it is a story not dissimilar to ""Silkwood"" and ""Erin Brokovich"".The cast is wonderful and the film is filled with terrific performances by Sydney Pollack, the great Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson and Michael O'Keefe (""Caddyshack"" fame). And to top it off, George Clooney gives his best and most diverse performance to date. We feel the burden he carries both in his personal life and at the office. This guy is up to his ears with stress, but he just keeps plugging.Sure, there are some moralistic questions and integrity issues throughout, but the tension is really minimal since there are no real twists or turns. I believe the decision to go with a non-linear presentation was purely to add a bit of interest to the film.Overall, it proves to watchable, but could have used a script doctor.

He believes that medical aid wasn't followed until he learns details that have him questioning the sanity or insanity of his client. Director Tony Gilroy is backed by a brilliant screenplay that toys with effective thriller elements as well as political drama. Another plus is characters and casting that are broad and enhancing to render more effective than average thrillers. George Clooney as Clayton is seen narrowly avoiding his car explosion in the opening. The film cuts back to what led to the attempt on his life and the case he is dealing with. Tom Wilkinson plays the lawyer he's attempting to clear. He is discovered to be bi-polar, which leads to outrageous outbursts and behaviour. Tilda Swinton plays a crucial role that doubles Wilkinson's actions back on itself. Sydney Pollack plays the firm head who addresses the case with Clooney.

Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a mega-sized law firm's fixer - a gambler with debts attempting to cover his brother's debts also - leaves a poker game, and in response to a telephone call drives at night, managing to avoid being blown up in his car as her silently converses with field horses.

The pending merger is with U-North,
headed by Karen (Tilda Swinton) and the manner in which this plays out involves the derring-do of U-North 'disposing' of Arthur and planning the murder of Michael...Complicated?

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Michael Clayton,10,29 December 2007,"I can't recall the last time I watched a satisfying lawyer related movie, and it brings me back to the time in the 90s where the John Grisham novels were being rushed to be made into films, starting with The Firm, and somehow stopping abruptly after the release of The Runaway Jury. While the Grisham novels always have a top lawyer with just morals, this one has almost everyone being a shady lawyer battling against one another's wits and wills.Michael Clayton is a lawyer movie, of the different kind. There's no courtroom debate with your objections, your sustains and a triggerhappy-with-a-hammer judge, but here we see more of the workings behind the scenes, set in a fictional top law firm Kenner, Bach & Ledeen, which has lawyers for hire to take on cases for clients who are willing to dish out top money for top brains. George Clooney plays the titular character, whom many bill as the Miracle Worker. That's the fanciful title for the job, which like others whom one will describe as picking up the pieces, in short, the janitor role in doing some of the dirty work to give the clients a leg up in litigation.And that in itself is the draw of the movie. It doesn't shy away from making all lawyers look like greedy money grabbing scoundrels, though it does have a sense of honour amongst thieves as exuded by the Michael Clayton character. In fact, here's possibly one of the most interesting anti-heroes (if I may call him that) who uses his connections and through the pulling of the right strings, get things done, at whatever the cost, with whatever the measures and options available. You mess up, he comes in to clean it up, and being the enigma he is in the circle, a client can't help but to feel confident that his troubles are well taken care of, and well worth the dollars paid for.What makes the entire plot compelling, are the extremely well crafted characters. It's a good welcome to see Tilda Swinton back on the big screen after her outing some 2 years ago with The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, and here she plays the legal counsel of a corporation U-North, who just got promoted into the hottest seat, and is desperate in using all means necessary to hold onto her position of power, which means settling a million dollar class action suit that impacts her bonus and standing. As with large firms, her U-North outsources the dirty work, for the guarantee of a scapegoat should something go wrong, to their vendor Kenner, Bach & Ledeen, and the long drawn case being led by the law firm's top gun Arthur Edens, played by the wonderful Tom Wilkinson, who goes berserk one day.Tom Wilkinson has now gone into my books as one of my favourite character actors. His voice resonates, and his appearance lends certain gravitas to the picture. Here, he plays a scumbag lawyer (ok, so I associate every lawyer here as a scumbag) who has woken up to his senses (or succumbed to madness?), and now is holding onto dangerously incriminating smoking gun type evidence. I always thought how one could survive in a profession that requires you to constantly lie, to turn black into white and vice versa, basically to demean, probably character assassinate opponents and destroy their moral credibility. Takes a lot, doesn't it? And I wonder too how they sleep at night, knowing that they have perverted justice through their cunningness. Guess it's just a job. *shrug*But an interesting ""character"" here, is the Corporation, represented by the law firm. As with all corporate entities, it's transfixed on its bottomline, market share, revenue and profits, so naturally it becomes beholden to its rich clients. If the client wants black to be called white, sure, that's what they'll do to maintain the big fish account, afraid that the client might take their business elsewhere. So morally bankrupt lawyers, do they exist?Michael Clayton is excellent, for the gripping plot that leaves you guessing what next, for its pace, and best of all, the awesome rapid fire dialogue. It's a talkie movie through and through, without subtitles too, and that probably explained why some audience walked out of the movie midway, as they might have thought that Clooney was either wearing a costume, or performing quick wardrobe changes ala his Danny Ocean, but here, it's sombre shirt, tie and overcoat almost all the way. And it's not just a one-track movie, with minor subplots involving Clayton's personal life of a broken family, debt and a business that went the wrong way, that get tied in perfectly into the main track.That said, this movie remains highly recommended, for those patience enough to experience all the curve balls being thrown at you every step of the way, through the narrative's four days leading to a satisfying wrap. Heavy reliance on Clooney's charisma to carry the movie through, and peppered with excellent supporting acts all around. Don't miss this!",Michael Clayton

34,blanbrn,Well done legal drama that thrills and uncovers corporate greed and corruption.,8,15 October 2007,"Have to say for a recent modern movie ""Michael Clayton"" doesn't let you down. It's well written and a film that you have to watch well with hidden subplots before the whole scheme is uncovered. Clooney is good as always here he plays the films title as Michael Clayton a world class corporate lawyer for a firm named Kenner, Bach, and Leeden. He's looked upon as a smooth over fixer up guy for the international firm no matter if he gets calls from the offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, or Chicago. Overall his character feels good at first with this anti-hero stance only to slowly feel drug down into the mud around him. The film takes an interesting turn when a firm lawyer unravels that being Arthur Edens(Tom Wilkinson) who freaks out during a legal meeting while he's defending the chemical company U/North against a farm family. This looks like a film then of manic depression and the destruction of the mind mentally by knocking out totally the Edens character. Yet deep down from the guilt felt the corporate greed, lies, and under the table profit is revealed one by one about U/North. Gradually the film transforms the Clooney character of Clayton from cynical smooth anti-hero to a soul truth searcher that brings redemption and justice against the greedy corporate firm. Great performance from Clooney he really put a lot of heart, emotion, and bravado into his work that made people feel some reality and acquired success thru justice.

Even though Sydney Pollack is involved as an executive producer & in the cast, this film is like OK but doubt it will be the Best Picture.George Clooney's performance in the title role is top notch. The film itself does not measure up to his acting. It starts near the end of the film, then rewinds 4 days and comes back to the end of the film in classic Hollywood flashback style. It is R rated but most of the rating is for language as there are no real skin shows that I saw.Clooneys ""fixer"" is an engaging character, but the flashback of 4 days from early on is confusing & makes the film hard to follow. This is a film that would actually be better if it started 4 days earlier & dropped the opening sequence near the end & just did it in order.The ending does tie the film together nicely, maybe even a little too neat. All the confusion from the flashback is even solved although I am still a little confused about how the murder/suicide fits into the 4 day time line as when you put the beginning together with the later part, the time line doesn't make any sense. That would be fixed by telling the story in order as that is not the only confusion the viewer gets from the opening sequence.This film is all oral & very little visual. That is a shame though all the actors perform well but I don't think this story is as well put together as some films from 2007 that are not even nominated for best picture.",Michael Clayton

But he has to face conflicts as a lawyer, a father, a ex-husband, a brother and as a friend. Tom Wilkinson really shines in this movie as a litigator in the trial who starts to lose his mind over guilt cause he knows that the company that is in the weed killing business has chemicals that kills people. The things take place in the legal background, he does not argue cases in court, he is like the janitor of the firm that cleans up the messes of the client by tiding up the situation. He is also a gambling man and is drunken and beaten down character, who fights against Tilda Swinton who is the main villain of this film. This is a suspense thriller that builds slowly, but you really need to pay attention to the movie to get whats going on. This film is not for everyone though since some may find this film dreary and boring, since it's a very plot driven movie that is sort of slow in building tension.

37,sddavis63,Michael Clayton Has Problems - The Man And The Movie,3,12 May 2008,"I have to confess that the first time I watched this film, I was asleep within about the first twenty minutes. Waking up about an hour later, I couldn't make any sense of anything, but attributing that to having missed a good portion of the movie, I decided to watch it again. On second viewing, I discovered a plot revolving around a class action lawsuit filed against a large corporation over some type of pesticide that causes cancer. The attorney assigned by a large New York law firm to defend the company (Tom Wilkinson) at one and the same time seems to go crazy and changes sides, deciding to leak damning information to the litigants. In steps Michael Clayton (George Clooney) - the law firm's ""fixer"" - to clean up the mess. In fixing it up, he becomes aware of the information that seems to incriminate the corporation. In short, the corporation has reason to want both Arthur, the original attorney-gone-insane and Clayton eliminated. Those are the bare bones. Revolving around that central plot are stories showing trouble in Michael's family, large debts incurred by his brother that he is trying to clear up, and the fact that Michael really truly hates his job - he wants to be back in the courtroom, but the law firm he works for thinks he's too good as the fixer.I found this movie lacked energy. Not action - I don't think a movie needs ""action"" to be exciting - but plain energy. The main plot meanders along at a relatively and surprisingly leisurely pace, and the subplots just bog things down a bit more. Part of the problem here, frankly, is Clooney. I know that many people think he's a major mega-star, and yet I honestly can't think of a single movie he's made that has really blown me away. He comes across to me as too low key and passionless. He's a TV actor who hasn't quite found a niche on the big screen. Just my opinion, of course. I compare this movie a bit to ""The Firm."" There's not a lot of ""action"" in that movie, either, but Tom Cruise - whose acting also doesn't blow me away - nevertheless injects energy into it, as he usually does. Clooney takes ""Michael Clayton"" in the opposite direction. He was predestined to play the role, of course. He was the Executive Producer! He was also, to me, the biggest weakness in an often confusing and less than gripping film. 3/10",Michael Clayton
38,Buddy-51,entertaining within limits,7,28 October 2007,"If ""Michael Clayton"" didn't seem like quite so obvious a rehash of Sidney Lumet's ""The Verdict,"" I might be inclined to recommend it more highly. The basic premise of both films revolves around a dissolute legal type who achieves personal redemption when he lands on the ""right"" side of a class action lawsuit. Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the best thing to be said for the makers of ""Michael Clayton"" is that, if they had to find a movie to emulate, they at least chose one worth emulating.Michael Clayton is no longer a practicing attorney himself but rather a ""fixer"" or ""bagman"" for a powerful legal firm, a man whose job it is to troubleshoot or run interference for any potential problems that might arise in one of its many cases. As with most such protagonists, Clayton spends so much time at his job that he doesn't have much of a personal life going for him: he's a divorced father with a serious gambling problem, a drug-addicted brother, and a failed business that has him in hock to the tune of $80,000. One of the firm's biggest clients is a chemical company whose powerful weed killing formula has allegedly resulted in serious medical conditions and even death for some of the farmers and their families who've come in contact with it. Clayton is called into action when the lead attorney for the defense suddenly goes berserk at a taped hearing, stripping off his clothes and launching into a Howard Beale-like rant for the other side. As he delves further into the case, Clayton undergoes a metamorphosis from cynical corporate water-carrier to enlightened populist do-gooder, finding personal redemption and fulfillment by helping the common man in his fight for justice.""Michael Clayton"" is, for the most part, a solid legal thriller, serious, intelligent and extremely well-served in the acting department. The ""little man vs. vile corporation"" theme has been pretty much played out by this time, but there are enough twists and turns in the plot and enough decent red herrings to keep us interested at least on a superficial level. The story goes through periods of murkiness when it isn't always clear what exactly is going on, but writer/director Tony Gilroy manages to straighten out most of the confusion in time for the finale. The moody score, bleak winter settings and dank cinematography all contribute to the chilly atmosphere that permeates the film.In a role tailor-made for his acting style - stoic yet heartfelt, rugged yet vulnerable - George Clooney carries the weight of the film on his sturdy shoulders. The gifted Tilda Swinton doesn't fare quite so well with her character - a ruthless, emotionally unstable career woman with no personal life and no romantic prospects, a character, quite frankly, that feels just a trifle out-of-date in the year 2007. Tom Wilkinson, Sydney Pollack and Michael O'Keefe excel in minor roles.""Michael Clayton"" is a proficient, professional legal drama that never cuts as deeply or touches one as profoundly as one would like for it to do.

And we're both in ""middle"" men job positions, only mine pays more! – Again, he's fictional and my money's real.As that last paragraph was a failed attempt at humor, it still holds true. I saw a lot of myself in him. Even when I am tired, and I'm not talking drowsy, I am down, but when need be, the shell of the person I used to be wakes up and acts. Much like the superb acting of George Clooney, who was nominated for an Oscar, and should have won. As was his co-star, Tom Wilkinson, who played Arthur to the tee. That was the best performance I've ever seen from him.Who did win, also definitely deserved an Oscar, was Tilda Swinton as Karen the Kover-up girl. She showed true humanisms in her evilness. Perhaps she wasn't evil, per se, but felt she needed to make ""choices"" to both help her company and her career. More so, I think she was leaning on keeping up her lifestyle even though it was wearing her down.Everyone here, pretty much, was worn down. It could be the high stress jobs they had, or just that the little white evil pill they sold their soul for in decades past finally expanded in their gut like one of those animal sponge toys kids play with in baths. All key actors, including the late and great Sydney Pollack, were pitch-perfect. No one gave a bad performance or made any inkling of unbelievable behaviors.The script was also top notch. It was like a grown up (and more realistic) John Grisham film. Grisham films tend to be fun, exciting and suspenseful, but practical they're not. (All, except A Time To Kill, that is.) Here we have the usual suspects: Big Eco-(un)Friendly Firm who's inadvertently poisoning'n'profiting and is represented by Clayton's law firm. Only, Clayton's more of a ""Janitor"" to clean up the client or big wig's messes. He's assigned to take care of lawyer peer who went Looney and streaked naked after a client when his evil pill got too large. Or should we just say, his conscious became conscious, finally.Clayton's still playing the game, or just running through the motions of life around him. He's so depressed, or tired, that the juggling act he has going on doesn't even phase him anymore. Hmmm, there's his ex-wife who watches his good son who needs attention, he's a recovering gambling addict, he has a failed business in junction with a large amount due to the wrong people, his clients are yelling at him, there's a potential merger at his job that might risk his future, oh and I forgot, someone's trying to kill him, immediately after a friend ""commits suicide."" All the while, he needs to wake up and fast to solve a mystery or end up asleep for good. In naysayer's defense to Michael Clayton as a film, it's not that difficult as a mystery. I'm happy about that – I don't always like spending 1 hour 58 minutes of a two hour movie trying to figure things out and not just simply enjoying the film.So, this might sound simple and easy to decipher, but that's where the well-written script by Tony Gilroy (another Academy Award Nominee for both writing and directing, not to mention Best Picture) really shines on the simplicity of both evil and character depth and development. The pacing is a tad bit slow and every bit welcome. You get to enjoy the richness of these soulless wanderers while they strive for redemption or revenge. In either case, the ones who are trying to hold onto the emptiness in any aspect in life, should perish while the ones who just let go (Network's ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"") at very least should try to do some good if they're on their way to hell.This movie was excellent. It's not spitting in your face GO GREEN, though that's part of the message. It's showing you, no matter what you've done; you can make the right choice. It's the hardest one when you're inches from rock bottom and you're getting tired from scratching your way to at least maintain that positionbut it's still possible to come back.Maybe I'm just looking too deep. I almost always have fun with Clooney and his quick wit and one-liners, whether funny or dead serious, are always a draw for me. Neither himself, nor anyone else lets you down in this character-driven classic. SEE IT!",Michael Clayton
40,sol1218,Mopping Up Expert,7,1 March 2008,"(There are Spoilers) Pretty straight froward motion picture without any real surprises including the not all that surprising ""twist ending"" at the end of the film. ""Michael Clayton"" is about corporate greed and how far a multi-billion dollar corporation,U-North, and the law firm that represents it,Kenner-Bach & Ledeen, would go to keep from losing a three billion dollar joint action lawsuit. As far as first degree murder.We see Kenner-Bach & Ledeen fixer Michael Clayton (George Clooney), the guy who does all the dirty work, in action at the beginning of the movie. Greasing the wheels of Justice to get a client off in a hit and run rap Michael then takes a ride outside of town in Westchester NY where for some unexplained reason his car, after he left it to what looked like to converse with some horses, exploded into a fiery ball of flames. It's then that we get the picture when were by the miracle of film editing transported, together with Michael, four days into the past and see what exactly transpired that lead to the attempted murder of Michael Clayton.Michael really wasn't interested in what the company that he worked for was doing so long as he got his paycheck every two weeks. It's when Michael's good friend Arthur Evens, Tom Wilkinson, went cuckoo-cuckoo and had a pair breakdown, in the corporate office and parking lot of Kenner-Bach & Ledeen, that Michael realized that he was, in his fix-it job for the company, both abetting and abating a major and nation-wide criminal conspiracy. Running around buff naked, with only his shoes and socks on, screeching and screaming, like we heard Arthur at the start of the movie, and letting the truth out about the U-North cover-up it was determined by the higher ups, like the law firms CEO Marty Bach (Sydnet Pollack), that Arthur was to be neutralized by any and all means possible. Arthur an attorney for Kenner-Bach& Ledeen was handling the U-North case for some six years and the pressure just got to him. Arthur's crack-up had to do with the shocking knowledge of his firms responsibility in covering up a major crime that U-North's insecticide department was involved in. A crime that lead to the deaths of some 450 people! It was up to Michael to get Arthur locked up and into a mental institution to keep him away from the public and the media until a settlement, in U-North's favor of course, was ironed out. Michael who had his own problems, like being in debt for $75,000 to the bookies and loan-sharks, wasn't really up to it and later when he found out what his firm as involved with, covering up the deaths of hundreds of people, he started having seconds thoughts about his job as a fixer for the company.****SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON**** Not being able to both keep Arthur from talking or locked away in a mental ward the firm had him iced, after his hiding place was discovered, and his death made to look like a massive heart-attack. Picking up the ball that his now dead friend Arthur dropped Michael started getting the goods on the company when he deciphered this explosive little red book secretly hidden in Arthur's loft apartment. The red book not only spelled out, with irrefutable evidence to back it up, what U-North was criminally involved with but also what Michael's law firm, Kenner-Bach& Ledeen, illegally did to cover it up!From this point on Michael was a marked man with a hit put on on his life to, like with Arthur, shut him up for good and forever. Knowing that his only hope for survival is to get the truth out to the public, thus bankrupting both U-North and his law firm, Michael together with, what I think is his brother, NYPD Detective Gene Clayton, Sean Cullen, set up a trap or ""sting"" to catch the firms-Kenner-Bach & Leden-top honcho high powered attorney Karen Crowder, Tilda Swinton, with both her guard and dress down. The plan, the only big surprise in the film, worked to perfection but only after Michael Clayton came back from the dead to pull it off!",Michael Clayton
41,Robert_duder,Maybe too intelligent for it's own good but a demanding and provocative film,8,14 October 2007,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Michael Clayton. On the one hand critics were heaping praise on it and on the other hand it was being marketed as a mainstream thriller so I wasn't sure what I'd walk into and basically it tries to balance a medium between artsy and powerful but mainstream enough to appease the fans but I don't think it successfully pulls off the latter. Instead Michael Clayton is this intense and provocative story that goes into incredible story detail that is almost overwhelming. It's definitely the film that you want to keep your eyes on at all times because even the slightest detail becomes crucially important. The film makers and creators don't just tell a story about a scandal involving a major corporation but they tell a story about lawyers...especially Clayton and his life and his future and his determination in finding retribution for all the things he's done in his life. It is easy to see why the title of the film is the lead character because the film focuses on his life...this movie is not about the scandal...it's about Clayton. Most of it's absolutely astonishing that first time director Tony Gilroy was able to create such an intriguing and intelligent story. He is a master of suspense writing having previously written Proof of Life, and The Bourne films but this will change his career I have no doubt.There was a time early in his TV to film transfer that I couldn't stand the sheer sight of George Clooney but things have changed since stand out performances and film making such as ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and even the Ocean's series. I think he's finally taking himself more seriously and Michael Clayton is one of his best roles ever. He is incredible and lights up the screen with this complex and intense character and probably should and will see another Oscar nod. I think a lot of his character should be attributed to Gilroy's writing but he definitely nails it on screen. Tom Wilkinson is a terrific character actor giving stunning performances and this one is no exception as the recently awakened lead lawyer for the corporation known as U-North. Wilkinson is deranged and yet is fighting for a very real cause that quickly becomes Clayton's cause. Wilkinson is great!! Tilda Swinton seems to be getting a lot of notice for this film and she was pretty good in her role but honestly I thought she was one of the weakest in the entire cast. Her character, to me, seemed kind of soft and emotional considering who and what she was supposed to stand for. She didn't come across as strong or cut throat because of her soft side. She wasn't a good adversary. However I understand they were trying to humanize the villain to make her seem more real but it felt wrong for the film. Multi Oscar nominated director Sydney Pollack plays a significant role as the head of the law firm and does a great job. He doesn't have a huge role although shows up on screen a lot and his sheer presence just ups the ante on the cast.The film definitely doesn't move at any high speeds, it sort of takes it's time and plays out by it's own rules and clock and doesn't apologize for it. It needs the time to tell the story and every aspect of it. It doesn't just tell one story...in fact it seemed to really get into the main story after almost an hour into the film. So it can be a little disconcerting for the average film goer that expects a high octane thriller because it's much more than that. You have to watch every detail and every twist and turn in the story. It's unique and it's brilliant and it really does grow on you. There was a time in the middle of the movie that I felt like I wasn't sure I was all that impressed but then you just find yourself watching these incredible performances and the story starts to come together and you really become enthralled with it. For anyone looking for something more intelligent than your average flick than Michael Clayton will definitely be right up your alley and you're likely to hear a lot more about it come Academy Award season. A worthwhile watch. 8.5/10",Michael Clayton
42,Lejink,Entertaining lo-fi thriller,7,14 April 2008,"Intricately plotted but not quite an edge-of-your-seat thriller, I found it best watched more than once (okay, with the commentary on, if I'm being honest). From the commentary I got the reference points to classic 70's thrillers like ""The Parallax View"", ""Network"" and ""Klute"", but updated to reflect modern technology and telecommunications, although at heart it's just another tale of corruption, exploitation and corporate malfeasance. I liked lots of the component parts, the circular time conclusion, reborn of ""Pulp Fiction"", the washed out neutral cinematography, James Newton-Howard's effective but unobtrusive soundtrack and some fine ensemble acting, particularly the deservedly lauded playing of Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson. Clooney's playing is more reserved, a touchstone for the slight excesses of the Swinton and Wilkinson characters and in keeping with the ""grace under pressure"" persona traits of his Mr Fixit character. I didn't however buy into the connection between George Clooney's son and the cracked whistle-blower played by Wilkinson and found as I usually do, the insertion of a child amongst such an obviously grown up world, to be a definite distraction. The coincidence whereby Clooney/Clayton escapes his planned demise is a bit unbelievable too. It also takes a long time to get going and really only hits its straps with the coldly-executed murder of Wilkinson's character but from there on it accelerates to a gratifying near-twist of an ending as the multi-national bad guys (and girl) get their come-uppance and Clooney's anti-hero title character gets a Garbo-like ""Queen Christina"" extended ""moment"" to close the movie in a suitably ambiguous way. Refreshingly downplaying gratuitous violence and sex, but still delivering thrills and intrigue this is a low-budget suspenser which repays close attention to detail.",Michael Clayton
43,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Doesn't pay off quite the way you expect it to but still quality film-making of the sort you don't see so much of nowadays,10,4 March 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a hot shot 'fixer' for a top law firm that's about to merge with another successful firm. But his personal life's in a bit of bother as he's struggling to pay off his younger brother's gambling debts and one of the firm's top lawyers and manic depressive Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) goes off his medication and becomes obsessed with helping a family who are trying to sue a pesticide firm for damage to their health. While strolling in a field Michael's car blows up, an obvious attempt on his life. Looking back from four days earlier, we unravel how this came to be.Nothing in Michael Clayton is straight-forward. The story, the characters or the motives. It demands your undivided attention right from the beginning and takes it hostage for nearly two hours, refusing to let it go until it's demands have been met. Everything has to be listened to, taken in and followed. Certainly not a film for those who can't think deep. All this makes it a film you have to see. But then it's a film you don't see so much of nowadays.The film pulls off the very clever trick of making an intricate and multi-layered film of what turns out to be a rather basic, straight-forward story by the end. It's hard to think of another film I've ever seen that's worked like this and it works out a lot better than it sounds. First time director Tony Gilroy has crafted a film with a great use of sound, atmosphere and mood, with a well delivered script with some classy dialogue.Cast wise, in the lead role, Clooney is impressively restrained and focused. I don't think I've seen much of his other stuff, but he certainly comes off as a good actor here rather than just a 'Hollywood hunk.' But it is Wilkinson, in the main supporting role, who steals the show, mesmerizing in every scene as the doolally top dog who's conscience has kicked in and who's woken up to the deep rooted emptiness he feels inside, despite everything he has 'acheived.' Not a film for those who can't think deep, then. And certainly not a film you see so much of nowadays. But not a film you can miss, either, to be honest. *****",Michael Clayton
44,MOscarbradley,A good old-fashioned thriller,7,16 June 2008,"A good thriller, very well done of its kind even if the material isn't particularly fresh or innovative. It's a road we've been down before; corporate shenanigans with murder as an easy option, which begins with what is basically the penultimate scene as a little teaser then flashes back to what lead to this sorry state of affairs. It's exciting in a thoroughly old-fashioned way, (the writer and first time director is Tony Gilroy who cut his teeth on the Bourne franchise), and it's very well acted.George Clooney is suitably world-weary as the disillusioned hero with a lot of baggage. Tom Wilkinson and the late Sydney Pollack are both excellent as lawyers with very different takes on very similar issues. Best of all there is Tilda Swinton as the kind of woman who has ice in her veins, (and you thought her Ice Queen in 'Narnia' was scary?), and who hires hit men as if she were picking a dress from the peg; it's beneath her to do it but it has to be done. I could have been doing with a lot more of her. Far from great, then, but it does exactly what it says on the tin.",Michael Clayton

I confess that a few years ago I was holding Clooney on prejudice and did not have a high opinion about his acting talents, he is doing better and better every film I see, and gets closer in my eyes to the status he has gained already in the eyes of many other.Gilroy's skills of director allow him to build a clever puzzle that slowly gets every piece in place and after a rather slow and confusing start accelerates in place and interest. Besides Clooney he is helped by good acting of the whole team, with special note to Tilda Swinton. It's a good and solid thriller, and a movie that succeeds to be more than the usual routine thriller from Hollywood.",Michael Clayton
46,MLDinTN,a movie for critics,2,16 September 2008,"This is one of those movies critics like but the general public will find boring. I didn't like this at all. Films like this getting nominated for awards is what makes me care less about seeing nominated pictures. I have no idea how Tilda Swinton won best supporting actress. She was hardly in it and didn't do much.The movie is about a lawyer, Michal Clayton, whom is sent by his firm to fix a case messed up by one of their bipolar lawyers. That lawyer stopped his meds and created an embarrassing scene. When that lawyer shows up dead, Clayton realizes maybe there was more to his ramblings and maybe covered up secrets.FINAL VERDICT: It's the big bad corporation against the public type of picture. Think the Insider or Erin Brockovich except this movie is no where near as good as those two. This movie is just boring.",Michael Clayton
47,g-bodyl,"Dark, Brooding Legal Thriller!",8,6 June 2012,"Michael Clayton is a very good film that is a welcome addition to the ""legal drama"" genre. This is the not the best film in the world, but it does deserve all seven Oscar nominations. What makes this film good is the acting and how this movie portrays greed and corruption as major human flaws.Now, I don't know much about how the legal system works. I only saw this movie because it was so well-received. This is pretty much about a flaw-firm fixer who gets into a big multi-billion dollar mess.The acting is just superb. George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, Sydney Pollack, and Tom Wilkinson all gives their A performances. All these characters were just memorable.Overall, this is a solid legal thriller with everything you would want out of a legal thriller. This film is what modern film-making should be. However, I took two points off because this film is a tad slow and tedious during parts but that did not stop me. I rate this film 8/10.",Michael Clayton
48,inkblot11,Great performances and an unconventional style make this a terrific film,8,17 February 2008,"Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a lawyer for an extremely large law firm in New York City. But, out of the almost 600 lawyers on the staff, Michael has a unique position. He is the ""janitor"" of the company, that is, when things need to be cleaned up in a hurry and on the sly, he is there to make the arrangements. Despite his usefulness, his salary is not overly generous, however. With a young son to support, he opened a restaurant with his brother, but the venture failed and he finds himself in a great deal of debt. Now, a respected lawyer for the firm, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), who has been litigating a complicated case for six years, suddenly goes off his medication and starts behaving irrationally. There is talk that Mr. Edens is strongly reconsidering the firm's position in the case, that he may even be aiding the opposition. Naturally, Michael is sent to get things in order. Yet, when Arthur spills his tale to the ""janitor"", about how the chemical company that they are representing may indeed have been negligent, Michael begins to realize that he may be right. Into the picture comes Karen (Tilda Swinton). She is the chemical giant's own lawyer and she is not about to lose the case. Will she be able to ""silence"" Mr. Edens? This is a terrific film, with an unconventional style and a great cast. The story unfolds like a painter's canvas, which each character and event adding elements to the bigger picture until the viewer finally sees the situation as a whole. Needless to say, this approach is impressive. As for the acting crew, it is also superior. Clooney is wonderful as the under-respected lawyer while Wilkinson, a most talented man, is marvelous as the high-strung legal partner who gains a conscience. In addition, Swinton is absolutely tremendous in a complex role. As a determined lawyer, she appears supremely confident but, as the film shows, it is all an act, for, at home, she is filled with doubt and ""practices"" her speeches over and over to avoid failure. All of the production's ingredients, from costumes to sets to cinematography, are fine, also. In short, anyone who cares about ""good"" cinema and wants to see the finest films available, should not miss Michael Clayton. It is richly rewarding, indeed.",Michael Clayton
49,tabuno,Big Disappointment,5,21 January 2019,"31 October 2007. The rather two-dimensional script and dialogue for Michael Clayton's character didn't offer George Clooney a lot to work with. The beginning was a hodgepodge of unnecessary confusion only to allow the ""surprise"" explosion in the beginning. The plot was loaded down with a lot of side baggage regarding Clayton's life that detracted from the main storyline. Clayton's backstory and his performance on screen didn't portray anybody that one would suspect a multi-billion dollar corporation would actual retain to do speciality jobs, in fact, it seemed that he was almost out-specialized in the movie most of the time. This movie was no ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) which was based on a true story and was even more compelling, no PELICAN BRIEF (1993). The cloak and dagger stuff was tame and uninspired compared to ENEMY OF THE STATE (1998) or one of the best THE THREE DAYS OF CONDOR (1975). It is a stretch to tie one's survival to a book. The one irony that may have been deliberate which had some sense of justice was how the former addict relative and Clayton's own compulsive behavior balanced out. Even the movie itself sunk under its own manipulative attempt to be something crime drama, thriller, espionage (black opts), political drama, family drama...something, an award nomination wouldn't be out of the question for the one performance that stood out for Tilda Swinton in one of the best supporting acting jobs of the year.",Michael Clayton
50,kenjha,Less Than Meets the Eye,6,19 June 2008,"A lawyer goes off the deep end and and must be brought back into the fold before his antics can do further damage to the law firm's client. Perhaps Gilroy realized the story was too simple to make an interesting movie, so he uses flashbacks and inserts irrelevant subplots to make it seem complicated and arty. All the slick editing means that it takes about half the film's length for the viewer to understand what's going on and then it becomes clear that what's going on is not very interesting. Clooney is OK in the title role, while Swinton's performance is hardly Oscar-worthy. Wilkinson comes off best, playing the troubled lawyer.",Michael Clayton

We then flash back four days. He owes a loan shark to cover his brother's debts (Michael's own gambling habits have left him virtually broke). Meanwhile his law firms top litigators goes off his meds and puts a big case in jeopardy.George Clooney Is extremely convincing in the title role. The guy has stardust all over him. He had long escaped his ""Gorgeous George"" tag to prove himself a great versatile actor. Tom Wilkinson deserves special praise for his performance here too, he is great.

A semblance of a premise squandered by too many characters who keep dropping in and out, disjointed plotting and a bizarre amount of bad decisions and contrived coincidences. We get it, *Monsanto is evil and lawyers are cutthroat. There is nothing insightful here.",Michael Clayton
53,johnnyboyz,"Superb slow burning thriller, as one man is plunged into the deep end of a world of corruption and sleaze, along the way forced into wedging out the truth.",8,25 August 2010,"From its haunting opening shots of a high-rise, which is practically empty as a manic voice offers us a sole presence, to its The Long Good Friday inspired final shot of an individual sitting in the back of a car forced into contemplating everything that has transpired; Michael Clayton is superb. The film covers a handful of characters operating within themselves and around a large farming company called U-North, whom are undergoing some legal difficulties due to some agricultural substances they sold which then went on to poison and consequently kill some of its customers. George Clooney plays the titular role; an initial outsider, a downbeat law man with a suit, sports car and a frown - a lower level attorney whom does his best to help people with whatever legal situations they find themselves in when somebody bigger and better cannot immediately help out. The film documents his plunge into a world of corruption; grief; danger; madness and death in what is a stunning debut film from a screenwriter turned director named Tony Gilroy.What can we tell of Michael Clayton before we've even laid eyes on him? He sits at a card game, somewhat desperate for money in a somewhat shady part of town with a Far Eastern theme. His items have been emptied out into a tray beforehand, as if the guys that run this little circle cannot trust their players with the weapons or firearms they might bring in case of disagreements. Exquisitte jewellery and a car key to a Mercedes Benz occupy Clayton's tray as he sits there in the other room dressed handsomely with some other rugged looking guys, and we begin to wonder why he's here amidst these other lowlifes at all. Then, some dialogue about a business venture which failed spectacularly and the money problems that arose because of it. It's the first of many shady instances that our lead Michael Clayton will find himself in, during which he's forced to confront the honest truth and bare the brunt of the reality of the situation as an additional and persistent sense of danger and desperation in Clayton's past business venture turning out to be a restaurant which went under and the money he owes acting as a nice, threatening item placed on the back-burner. Lots are at stake in the man's life, and after the game he visits a man on business he may be able to help whom has committed a hit and run; but Clayton cannot offer much in the way of aid, thus embedding a certain sense of danger or vulnerability as to whether he'll be capable to dealing with larger stakes as they arrive later on.The film is anchored by a sublime Tom Wilkinson performance as lawyer Arthur Edens, a man charged with defending U-North against the lawsuit and accusations but suffering a mental breakdown; forced into having Clayton escort him away from the case but consequently eluding him. As things develop, he himself appears to have an agenda of his own regarding the case. One of the starker sequences of the film sees Edens watch a U-North commercial on a cassette tape for specific reasons, its colour and vibrancy as it cross dissolves from images of smiling children to gold fields full of corn ripe for the harvest, placed in disturbing contrast to what it was really up to. Wilkinson's dishevelled stare as everything up to this point comes to mind is a stunning picture of guilt and regret at how everything that happened did so. Gilroy provides Edens with such a stark sense of personality, giving him a close to all but child-like sensibility in his evening phone discussions with Clayton's son over a child's franchise book but on other occasions providing him with the necessary adult characteristics so as to build his own case and make his own inroads into the situation.In beginning his film with an establishing shot of a bleak looking skyscraper before cutting indoors to the sparsely populated corridors and empty conference rooms, Gilroy calls to mind a certain sense of Capitalism by way of the tall, sky-scraping building we observe dominating the skyline; an item of iconography suggesting presence within of business and trade. What effectively follows is the apparent literal sense of emptiness or vacuity within once we're inside in representational building. In a film all about a corrupt company with face value put across by way of its promotional cassette, Gilroy's awareness of beginning the film in this fashion is impressive.On a similar note, Tilda Swinton's U-North employee named Karen Crowder acts as a sort of physical representation of this idea of one thing being one thing on the outside and another on the inside. Whilst standing in front of a mirror, a key item when it comes to representing reflectivity, she practises a speech promoting her company and must begin again and again when stumbling mid way through. Later comes a sequence in which she pitches her company to some other business cohorts whilst sitting at a long; lavish; wooden conference table, company logo directly behind with a silent co-worker sitting next to her literally grimacing at each statistic she churns out so as to continuously promote U-North. We're sure both of them know of the realities of the company. That sense of having to become, or adopt, one person or persona both in and out of the board room is eerily and effectively apparent. The film is, quite frankly, a gripping piece full of attention to the finer details of narrative and character with a string of incredible performances assisted with symbolism that isn't clunky or out of place, all of which provides us with a wonderful thriller culminating in one of the films of the last few years.",Michael Clayton
54,filipemanuelneto,The relativity of morality.,7,13 December 2020,"This film is one of those I saw out of curiosity, seduced by a short summary of its script and also by the luxurious cast, which includes George Clooney and Tilda Swinton (in my perspective one of those actresses somewhat overlooked, but who has a talent that we can't help but recognize). I'm glad I did, the film really deserves attention, even though it has been a little out of the public's attention.The film weaves a pleasant thriller around a large law firm committed to the defense of an indigestible client: a chemical corporation, as guilty as sin in a class action filed by several plaintiffs, who accuse it of poisoning. When the lawyer leading the case, one of the most experienced in the firm, finds out the truth, has a nervous breakdown and is so possessed by his own guilt that he starts doing everything he can to report what he knows, even if it is highly damaging for the law firm that, desperate to contain damage, mobilizes a collaborator whose specialty is managing crises and dealing with difficult situations, a highly indebted man, with a life full of problems and who is adept at putting the truth into perspective. However, this situation will test his skills as well as his morality. I believe that no lawyer likes to defend unscrupulous clients that he knows they are guilty, but for the good lawyer even the Devil has the right to defense, and it is up to the lawyer to protect his client's interests as much as possible, no matter how bad he is. This thriller uses the theme of inner guilt well to question the extent to which a lawyer can dissociate himself from what he has to do professionally.In addition to the appealing theme, the film has a truly seductive cast of actors. George Clooney is one of those actors who almost always does well in everything and has an almost bulletproof talent. Here, he gives life to an unpleasant character, someone I would not want for a friend and much less an enemy, an experienced, artful lawyer, skilled in handling facts and for whom the truth is a matter of perspective. But the actor does it in a way that it is impossible not to sympathize with the character and to realize how frustrated he is for what he does and little appreciated by the bosses themselves, despite basically doing their dirty work! Another actress worth mentioning is Tilda Swinton, who gave life to one of the directors of the chemical firm. She is a woman of few scruples and whose concern is to save the face of the firm even if it means lying unabashedly. She reminded me of those individuals who take a roasted chicken bone, wash it and try to sell it as a saint relic. The actress's performance was good enough to earn her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and I think it contributed a lot to how she transformed the character into someone on the verge of a nervous or mental breakdown. But even more striking, for me, was Tom Wilkinson's performance, in a deeply tragic character.I think the film is quite lukewarm on technical issues. There is no cinematography that stands out in any way, and the sets and costumes are basically the ones we could hope to find. In addition, we also have the fact that the film takes its time to attract our attention and to truly engage. One thing that I really liked was the way the film starts, with a whole brutal monologue about the law firm, able to take us immediately to the topic and put us right on the spotlight of the film. The scene of the car explosion was also well done and it is the moment where the special effects were able to participate more visibly.",Michael Clayton

56,howard.schumann,A film of intelligence and genuine interest in its characters,9,11 February 2008,"In these days when politicians, businessmen, and professionals are often willing to mortgage their integrity for ambition and profit, Tony Gilroy's Michael Clayton reminds us of the moral and psychological cost involved. Gilroy, known for being the main screenwriter for the Bourne series, delivers a film of intelligence and genuine interest in its characters, more of a character study than a thriller. In one of the best and most nuanced performances of his career, George Clooney is Michael Clayton, a ""fixer"" for the prominent New York law firm Kenner, Bach & Ledeen. The divorced and disillusioned Clayton, who reminded me of the world weary Sheriff Ed Bell from No Country for Old Men, is not a trial lawyer but a ""janitor"" who is sent to clean up the firm's dirty linen, a go to guy who smooths things out for wealthy clients who are in a jam.A dark presence, Clayton carries around the weight of his personal compromises and of being passed over for a partnership despite being with the firm for fifteen years. Burdened with debts from a failed business and choked by a gambling habit, he has not had to pause and take stock of what his life was about - until an assignment from the firm's head Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) begins to open his eyes. Marty assigns Michael to restrain Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), the lead attorney defending an agribusiness giant named U/North. Edens has become aware of incriminating evidence against the conglomerate accused in a class action suit of poisoning farmers with its pesticides and causing the deaths of 450 people and opens the film off camera with a deranged monologue in which he sees himself covered in filth and engaged in the destruction of humanity.Off of his medication for bi-polar disease, the corpulent attorney has a breakdown in front of a deposition, causing great embarrassment to the firm that was anticipating a favorable settlement of the $3 billion lawsuit that has dragged on for years. The settlement had been eagerly anticipated by U/North's counsel Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), a calculating and rigid attorney. Clayton, in carrying out his assignment in return for the $80,000 he needs to hold off his creditors, is pursued by thugs hired by Crowder who fears the failure to produce a settlement will damage her career. Hard to follow at the beginning, once Michael Clayton hits its stride it becomes a riveting ride. As the cynical Clayton finally comes to grips with what he has become, the film delivers a stunning payback.",Michael Clayton
57,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Clayton"" thrives on its actors",7,15 January 2008,"Like any average film, star power and great acting can help out a lot. George Clooney, Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson are unquestionably the reason for ""Michael Clayton"" catching viewer interest. Without them, ""Clayton"" is an overly complex and far from forward corruption thriller.Some credit, however, is due to director/writer Tony Gilroy, previously known for penning the Bourne movies. ""Clayton"" is told in a similarly calm, but suspenseful fashion. Gilroy is sure to show his characters in a variety of character-revealing situations, taking advantage of opportunities to juxtapose dialogue that doesn't necessitate images with images that don't necessitate dialogue. It keeps the spotlight on the actors (namely Swinton's character comes to mind) and keeps viewers' attention.Clooney stars as the title character, a law firm's ""fixer"" with a reputation for getting the job done. He gives a performance that is very him yet much more subtly so, which makes his bigger scenes towards the end more effective. Swinton plays the representative of the defendant in the film's case who is represented by Clayton's firm. She is a phenomenal nervous wreck of a character. Wilkinson plays a most intriguing role as the case's attorney who is manic depressive, insane and simultaneously genius. Wilkinson blends these colors to show these aspects incredibly well.Though certainly hard to follow, the talent keeps ""Clayton"" interesting and the plot delivers in the end. While some parts of the film seemed unaddressed, the overall idea comes together and makes sense.",Michael Clayton

59,jzappa,"A Model of Intelligent, Impactful Film-making",10,30 October 2007,"I have always loved to watch George Clooney, but he's always appeared to be a limited actor. In Michael Clayton, he stuns us. He wears a poker face for the majority of his time on screen, but not the same as usual. In that expression, he finds the perfect note of not just moodiness but the epitome of his entire character. As most anyone who's even heard of this film knows, he's a fixer for an important law firm, controlling the risks of connected people's mistakes. He's realistic, but we get the impression he wasn't born that way. He's in the hole because of a failed restaurant, he only sees his son on Saturdays and when he drives him to school. His feet never wanted to stay this firmly on the ground. In Michael Clayton, George Clooney gives the finest performance of his entire career.Tony Gilroy's directorial debut is a film where, in all departments, it is truly a model of intelligent, impactful film-making. The cinematography embodies the sensitive, down-to-earth complexion of the film. It has calm yet despondent establishing shots, editing that is rigid and smooth yet it stresses the pressure in conversations, especially a truly riveting one between Clooney and Tom Wilkinson, and lighting that balances the vividly beaming sanitary formality of Clayton's business world from the restful affection of homes, especially that of Clayton's family, and wintery neighborhoods and the capturing of the realest effect of twilight in a field. It's a subtle film. It's an honest film.Clooney is not the only stand-out, however much he radiates here. The cast in this film is particularly pungent, one of the greatest ensemble performances that I can recall. Wilkinson delivers on a tremendous note, portraying his mental instability in quite an effective way that is rarely seen in movies, and yet still disturbingly convincing in his passionate, overemotional tirades. I imagine an Oscar nomination, if not a win. Tilda Swinton, another strong English installment in the cast, definitely gives one of the most interesting performances I've ever seen. She is the antagonist, she is wrong, she does terrible things, yet we feel such immense pity for her. She is introduced as she scrambles to tighten the bolts on her nerves, practicing her spiel and brooding at her plain appearance in her skivvies in the mirror. Sydney Pollack adds a wonderful spice to the film as the head of the law firm, and a harshly sagacious guy he is, and it's no wonder a person with such hidden sadness like Clayton would find such a friend in him.Clooney has an obvious finger in the creative control. One of the reasons I admire him so greatly and feel that he is one of the most important presences in cinema right now is because of his taste in film and his idea of what a film should do and how it should be made. He favorite films include most of the greatest films from the 1970s, perhaps the greatest decade in the history of American movies, and in Michael Clayton, there are many hints, in the depth the story has without being anything other than a legal drama, the power of dialogue, the power of a performance, and especially in obvious instances of the film-making itself, Clayton feels just like one of those ideal, exemplary American movies from the 1970s.",Michael Clayton
60,robert-temple-1,The Clayton Identity,6,22 February 2008,"This is a deeply flawed film that should have been superb, especially considering the spectacular performances in it by Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton. What is wrong is that Tony Gilroy has been writing too many Bourne films for too long and got away for so long with action and tension carrying his stories, that he has forgotten about clarity and exposition. He should not have chosen this as a directorial debut, because he was so close to his own material that his nose was up it, and having his brother as the editor was not a good idea either, as where was the objectivity? Nobody was standing back and saying: 'Is this clear? Can people understand what is going on?' The script is, frankly, a mess. Despite highly-charged performances by a lot of pros, not least the amazing Sydney Pollack (maybe the reason he became a successful producer is that he acts so well that he can charm any investor), the film waddles around like a duck. The lead character is played by the always watchable George Clooney (and you want to look at him more the older he gets, which is a good career sign), and he is surrounded by a lot of confusing people who may or may not be his family, a child who appears to be his but we're not sure, two or three guys one of whom is apparently his brother but we don't know which one, some women who know him and hug him but we don't know why. This is all such a mess, really, Gilroy should go back to school. Clooney has no love interest (apparently this was cut out, a big mistake). Does he have one of those embittered American ex-wives? This is not clear. Why does the little boy not speak clearly? He suffers from Dakota Fanning syndrome, i.e., the inability to articulate his words so that we know what on earth he is saying. Also, his scenes are vaguely scripted, and make no sense at all. Sure, the kid is bright and lively, but what is he saying, and why is he saying it? Tilda Swinton is so chilling, anybody would be frightened. She is the arch-villainess of the film, but the reason why she is so effective is that she herself is clearly terrified as she orders people to be killed. The idea of a deadly villainess with existential angst and a self-esteem problem is intriguing and new. Was that her idea or Gilroy's? Anyway, that is really clever. As for Tom Wilkinson, this was the part of a lifetime and he gives it the performance of a lifetime. His role was somewhat over-scripted. Really, Gilroy got the breakdown part of it seriously OTT and the melodrama got too thick. This all should have been done more subtly. But Wilkinson overcame those script weaknesses by sheer force of performance and the conviction he conveyed. If only this film hadn't been 'too clever by half' it could have been wholly a success. All those great performances were thrown away on something that was allowed to sprawl all over the place. Confusion as a technique was pioneered by Orson Welles in 'Citizen Kane', but you have to be a genius to pull it off, and there was no genius writing and directing this film. Confusion that fails is, well, confusion that fails.",Michael Clayton
61,Chris Knipp,A mainstream moral mess with some smarts,8,7 October 2007,"Tony (Bourne franchise scripter) Gilroy, directing as well as writing this time, strives for a kind of disheveled moral grandeur in this thriller about corporate lawyers who slowly turn on the chemical company U/North, which one of their ace partners has been defending against a $9 million class action lawsuit for six years. This is Arthur (Tom Wilkinson), a man with a ""chemical imbalance"" who goes off his medication and has a psychotic break (his role's been compared to Peter Finch's in the 1976 'Network')--thus temporarily concealing from his associates the fact that he's found damning evidence and has gone over, quite rationally and determinedly, to the class action side. Michael Clayton, the law firm's corporate fixer or bailout man (""janiter,"" he prefers to call it) is summoned to rescue Arthur and smooth things over with U/North. But Arthur's meltdown at a deposition-taking in Minneapolis draws the attention of Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), the chemical firm's general counsel. In Gilroy's somewhat sexist portrait, she's seen constantly pondering her outfits and practicing her public lines. No such self-doubt from the law firm's main partner, Manny (Sydney Pollack).Gilroy's idea of corporate lawyers turning into whistle blowers (Michael's family origins--Irish Catholic cops--come in handy) makes for a drama that holds the attention. One wonders how it would have played without Wilkinson's flashy acting, Swinton's proved skill at playing the evil sprite or wicked witch, or Clooney's matinée idol glamor. You can call this a down-and-dirty role for George, but it's really much less so than the one he had in 'Syriana.' This drama hovers, sometimes successfully, sometimes a bit uneasily, between the Clooney-Soderbergh team's edgy stuff and their pop money-makers. Clayton wears sharp-looking dark suits (at all times) and expensive Swiss watches, drives a sleek new black company Mercedes, and can bum $80,000 off Manny to pay his debts from a failed bar-restaurant venture--and still have a fews thousand left over to indulge his high-stakes gambling habit. Even his failings are glamorous, and he has a dashing final scene where he brings the bad guys quickly to their knees. It's one of several wonderfully cinematic moments by Gilroy, who has jumped into the Hollywood directorial A-list with this debut--depending on box office receipts, that is; but the critical reception is looking good.People get surveilled, then killed; one attempt fails. The plot pins all the bad stuff on Crowder; incredibly, she takes decisions without needing approval from above. These are larger-than-life portraits, with some fudging of details, some incredible strokes of luck--and too much loud portentous music from an annoying soundtrack constantly telling us how important and climactic every scene is. Still, Gilroy knows how to tell an action story, and I don't buy that this is a knockoff of a 70's muckraking movie. Gilroy's into something different. It's original of him to focus on a lawsuit without even entering a courtroom, showing a deposition (the key document is a scientist's report from fifteen years before that that the U/North CEO signed off on)--making the main lawyers either half-crazy (Arthur) or essentially canny businessmen (Manny) or mop-up guys who can make a deal about just about anything (Michael). ""The truth can be adjusted"" is the movie's slogan, a transparently ironic one. Truth can be adjusted--until it can't. Maybe; maybe not. But isn't it pretty to think so--that the truth will out, even in corporate law? There is an element of feel-good manipulation throughout this slick tale, but it's caviar to the general: it assumes the mainstream audience isn't made up of Neanderthals, after all.",Michael Clayton
62,thinker1691,""" The worse thing you can do when trying to kill someone is . . . miss """,9,12 November 2009,"The mistakes of huge corporations in this country are manifest, accumulating and undeniable. Every day, Americans learn these industrial giants are forever embracing anything which is beautiful with their toxic hands and contaminating them. Once they have destroyed their victim, they call on their manipulative but equally corrupt judicial brothers in the Law to 'spin' their guilt. This film is a good case in point. The movie is called "" Michael Clayton "" and it stars George Clooney. Michael is an experienced legal mind with the expert propensity to 'Fix' any legal situation which has the potential of ruining a corporation's effort to control an ongoing ligation. Although, brilliant and talented at fixing legal problems, his personal life is in shambles. Not only does he have family problems, but is a luckless gambler with enormous personal and business debts. However, his problems multiply when Arthur Edens ( Tom Wilkinson) an old lawyer friend has not only a change of conscience but also has had enough of a lengthy Class action suit. Deciding to do the right thing Edens side with the Plaintiffs, which angers his employer (Ken Howard ) who is very impatient with the six year case. Turning against them, they decide to remove Edens from the case and murder him. When Claton tries to save his friend, the same firm decides he's expendable as well. A new fixer is employed (Tilda Swinton) and her first job is to remove both the lawyer and his friend and make the case go away.

63,Polaris_DiB,Surprising dramatic creation,7,15 October 2007,"My initial reaction to how to review this movie would be to call it a legal thriller; however, the fact of the matter is that it's a story operating decidedly outside generic conventions, which is generally a good thing. It's the story of the title character (played by George Clooney, in a role that seems very much Clooney-esquire and which seems custom fitted to his personality), a ""janitor"" or ""fixer"" (advisor) of sorts in a high-class law firm who is sent in to straighten out problems that occur with the attorneys of various lawsuits within the firm. After a high-ranking attorney starts going paranoid and stripping in front of his clients--he has emotional problems but has willingly stopped taking his medication--Michael is asked to prevent the lawsuit from becoming even more substantial and conflicted. This is a hard thing to do because the lawsuit itself involves several million dollars and is based around a multinational corporation that is poisoning people with its products.The difficulty Tony Gilroy must have had in writing/directing this work (he did both) is that there was sides he wanted to present but he couldn't just let his characters automatically know them. Therefore there's two stories playing in the same movie: the story of the multinational corporation's abuse of consumer safety laws, and how a lone man gets sucked into it, and the story of the man himself and how his dependency upon a system makes him have to question his own values. The two mix, but sometimes the larger story gets ahead of the smaller one and it becomes a bit confusing: the audience always knew more than the characters. Scene by scene, I felt like I had to go back and remind myself that the person on the screen didn't know the story I did, especially since the focus of this movie, honestly, is on Clooney's acting. The worst moment of that dissonance is the end. It's really hard to see how Michael Clayton's set-up resolve the conflict that Gilroy spent the entire movie building, and it's weird to see a character like Swinton's weakness used (instead of changed or improved) as the resolution.However, for the paranoiac inside each of us, this movie is a pretty decent appetizer. Mostly, it's a movie made for the actors; George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, and Tom Wilkinson pull no punches and deliver everything they've got. It may have some expositional problems, but for the most part it's finely crafted and it looks very good, plus it contains a decent amount of suspense to keep the attention away from focusing on endless amounts of dialog. The best part? That ""teh evol corporation"" is lead by a very human and very weak Tilda Swinton, showing that sometimes even those that are the targets of our consumerist wrath are victims as well. Such an approach is so much harder than just presenting the Erin Brockovich story of a hero that shows up a villainized corporation created entirely, and two-dimensionally, of greed.--PolarisDiB",Michael Clayton
64,dfranzen70,"Unevenly directed, well acted, Grisham-lite",6,4 May 2008,"Michael Clayton, despite wonderful, sincere performances by George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, and Tom Wilkinson, is alternately confusing and overwrought, and once the bells and whistles of the extraneous plot devices are stripped it’s no better or worse than a standard John Grisham adaptation. There, a nice run-on sentence to start things off. And a sentence fragment.Michael (Clooney) is a high-powered law firm’s fixer, i.e, the guy who solves the myriad problems that the firm’s clients and partners encounter on a daily basis. He knows people who know people, see? He’s got people to make your issues go away. Clayton’s sent by his boss Marty (Sydney Pollack) to Milwaukee, where Arthur Edens (Wilkinson) has just freaked out. Arthur has been working on a huge case for sixteen years, one involving a class-action suit against a weed-killer manufacturer. (Arthur’s on the defendant’s side.) In the middle of a deposition being given by one of the victims, Arthur suddenly begins ranting and stripping naked. He’s cracked from the pressure, you see, the pressure of defending a huge company whose product has killed over 400 people. Allegedly.Now, knowing this little, you can make a good guess as to how this plays out. Michael is there to prop Arthur up, make him just presentable enough to placate the company their firm is representing (Unorth). But Arthur will have none of that, and he goes rogue. I bet you can predict that at some point Michael Clayton will figure out that Arthur’s NOT crazy, even with a manic-depressive history, that the evil conglomerate manufacturer really IS killing people. It’s not a great leap of faith to come to this conclusion.Meanwhile, Michael has other troubles. He’s trying to buy back the restaurant he and his brother used to own, and he’s coming up short. He has partial custody of his young son, and although his ex isn’t the stereotypical screaming harpy you see in most movies, she’s not falling over herself to help Michael out. Oh, and his other brother is a very slowly recovering alkie and druggie. So there are home issues. All this while Michael has to run around putting out fires.I always enjoy watching George Clooney act. He’s sympathetic while not seeming to be a victim; he seems real and genuine, but not a superhero or righteous crusader. He continues to seem like a guy you wouldn’t mind hanging with, or being the godfather to your kids, or maybe serving frappucinos at Starbucks. You know, a reg’lar fella. No fault, really, with his work here, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. He’s overworked and completely consumed by stress and anxiety, which happens to a lot of us. With Michael, though, he can’t throw himself into one thing (e.g., family) to deal with the stress of another (e.g., work), because each offers plenty o’ stress.By contrast, Swinton (who won Best Supporting Actress) give a much less-nuanced performance, what little we get to see of it. She plays the lead counsel of the Big Evil Company, and I figured we’d see her being all conflicted and stuff. There was some ethical conflict there, yes, but not nearly enough. Her Karen Crowder isn’t very well developed at all, and she doesn’t really even seem like a decent (i.e., decisive) lawyer. Karen’s unsure about everything, and although that may have been meant to illustrate to us how she’s terminally conflicted defending an evil company or something, it certainly didn’t come across that way. Still, I’ll blame these shortcomings more on the script than on the acting, which wasn’t bad.Bookending with Clooney in terms of awesome performances was Wilkinson as Arthur Edens, a man who has finally decided to do the right thing after only sixteen years. Bitter, but only at himself, Arthur spends a good portion of the movie trying to figure out what to do - confront UNorth, confront his bosses, run away, kill himself, and so on. Arthur is passionate in finally acknowledging his complicity, and Wilkinson offers more emotion in his stubborn off-his-meds behavior than in the prim, stiff am-I-good-enough doubtings of Karen. Wilkinson, like Clooney, was nominated for an Oscar but didn’t win. Wilkinson makes you give a rat’s ass about the story a lot more than Swinton does, and that’s the key difference here.In all, Michael Clayton is slight entertainment, but it’s basically just a typical big-bad-corporation legal “thriller” that manages to not be terribly thrilling. The one thing it has going for it, other than the excellent acting, is that some of the events in the movie are not told sequentially. This is good and bad; good that it helps fill in gaps later, bad that those gaps had to be filled in.",Michael Clayton
65,PWNYCNY,Slow start but strong finish.,8,23 October 2007,"This movie starts slowly but then the tempo picks up and what at first seems to be just another long, pretentious Hollywood clunker turns into an interesting and well-acted story. George Clooney is excellent in the title role. The movie is long but avoids becoming tedious and the story is complex but not so convoluted that it loses its direction. Where the movie tends to be weak is the ludicrous character of the attorney who for reasons that can only be surmised decides to betray his own client, a large corporate conglomerate which happens to be paying millions of dollars to this attorney's firm in legal fees. This was stretching literary license to the limit. But other than that the movie presents a credible story that should keep the audience's attention, which nowadays is saying a lot.

66,ackstasis,"""I'm not the guy you kill. I'm the guy you buy off. Are you so blind that you can't see that?""",7,29 October 2007,"Precious few decent thrillers have come our way in the last decade, so it's important that, when one does arrive, you're there to greet it. 'Michael Clayton,' the directorial debut of screenwriter Tony Gilroy (""The Bourne trilogy""), is a mature, intelligent and polished corporate/legal thriller, featuring excellent performances from George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton and Sydney Pollack. Clooney, in what surely must be one of his most accomplished performances, plays the title character, a ""fixer"" at a corporate law firm. His job is to clean up the messes made by his employers, which might entail everything from hit-and-runs to shoplifting wives to crooked politicians. Michael basically likens himself to a janitor; he's crucial to the operation of the law firm, but his services are taken for granted. Despite being around for seventeen years, he isn't a partner, and nobody knows his name. He is a ghost. At least, that is before one of his most esteemed colleagues, Arthur Edens (Wilkinson), suffers a moral crisis and a nervous breakdown, ludicrously stripping during a court session and chasing one of the witnesses through a snowstorm. This unfortunate incident sparks the concern of the law firm's primary client, agrochemical company U/North (including chief counsel Karen Crowder, played by Tilda Swinton), who fear that their multi-billion dollar trial may have been placed in jeopardy.I've heard one reviewer describe the film as ""slow-burning,"" and that's quite an appropriate description for it. Don't expect to be gripping the arms of your seat for 120 minutes, because that's not what the film is trying to do. It starts at a rather leisurely tempo, gradually building upon the tension over and over again, never lapsing into any extended periods of stagnation. This very deliberate pacing creates a continual atmosphere of uncertainty and anxiety, and the story works towards a climax that is satisfying without going over-the-top. Gilroy's taut script also boasts countless layers, which manage to intrigue the audience without slowing down the story: aside from his work for the law firm, Michael faces numerous personal problems, including his failed business venture and hefty debt, his gambling obsession, his drug-addicted brother and the son that he doesn't get to see as often as he'd like. All these minor sub-plots are weaved thoughtfully and effectively into the main narrative, producing a rich character study of Michael Clayton and his difficult life, exploring how his current situation might effect the choices he makes during this career-breaking predicament.Despite an absorbing screenplay and Robert Elswit's polished cinematography, 'Michael Clayton's' greatest asset is its acting performances, and each of the main players delivers marvellously. George Clooney tackles a difficult character and succeeds in effectively portraying Michael's wants, needs and frustrations; his scene with Arthur in the prison cell is thoroughly gripping, a testament to his true talent as an actor {just when we thought that his greatest skills lay in directing!}. Tom Wilkinson also performs brilliantly, playing a worn-down lawyer who suffers a problematic moral epiphany after going off his anti-depressant medication. It's easy to see that Arthur Eden is a completely broken man: following his nudity episode, we come across him, a paper bag of baguettes clasped tightly under one arm, wandering wide-eyed through the city, as though he is a child experiencing the splendour of the world around him for the first time. For once in his life, we might argue, Arthur has cast aside the prison of immorality that was keeping him at work, and he is now able to witness the devastating effects of his actions. It's about time that Michael Clayton had an ethical revelation of his own. ""I am Shiva, the god of death."" The words of a mad-man, or the words of one who has suddenly lapsed from a lifetime of insanity?",Michael Clayton
67,meeza,It's Clay Time!,8,22 January 2008,"""Michael Clayton"" is the autobiographical film based on the life of NFL Wide Receiver Michael Clayton who plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. OK, that is not true! But ""the truth can be adjusted""; that happens to be the tagline from the film ""Michael Clayton"". I think there should be a prequel to ""Michael Clayton"" titled ""Mark Clayton"" based on the life of one of the all-time NFL great wide receivers who also happened to be Hall-Of-Fame Quarterback Dan Marino's favorite target from his Miami Dolphins' receiving corps. OK, so I was probably the biggest Mark Clayton fan when he played for the Fins. This film review is shortly becoming a sports editorial column so let me bring it back to the original M.C. this is about. A little known self-doubting unattractive actor named George Clooney (the truth can be adjusted) stars as Michael Clayton, a troubleshooting legal counsel who creatively fixes certain wrongdoings of the firm he represents. These legal eagles or beagles, as some people refer to them as dogs, are known in the legal circles as janitor attorneys or fixers. Tom Wilkinson co-stars as Arthur Edens, that same firm's legendary attorney who goes on a deranged naked rampage during a trial discourse when representing the U/North Environmental Organization. Arthur suffers from mental delirium and obviously forgot to take his medications before his legal ""illegal exhibition"" and that is the naked truth. Tilda Swinton plays Karen Crowder, U/North's litigator whose career is heading U/South unless she can successfully defend in getting the organization out of a lawsuit ordeal. So when Arthur loses his marbles and underwear for that matter, Ms. Crowder gets livid but unfortunately for the male viewing population does not unravel in a striptease tantrum like Arthur. Clayton is brought to the core of the conflict by trying to fix this mess; his biggest clean job in his ""dirty laundry"" janitorial career. Clayton, who is worn down from other personal & financial ordeals, is caught up in the riptide of this legal environmental crisis while dealing with his own ""Claytonic"" waves. The acting of ""Michael Clayton"" was truly magnificent. Clooney's performance was profoundly intensive, and Swinton & Wilkinson's acting efforts were supportively superior. Writer-Director Tony Gilroy's orchestration of ""Michael Clayton"" did encompass arousing legal suspense & unpredictability; even though it was partly guilty of some minor screenplay flaws but again ""the truth can be adjusted"". As much as I liked ""Michael Clayton, this reviewer's opinion is that it has gotten too much love by film critics. However, I do recommend cleaning up your act if you still have not witnessed ""Michael Clayton"". **** Good",Michael Clayton

Best of all it doesn't cheat with any of the twists and turns of the plot. The film does a good job of showing just enough information to keep you hooked and then re-contextualizes what was shown to be surprising.I don't have a ton to say about this film, only that it is a really well put together example of its genre. Swinton and Wilkinson are both really good in this. They have no pretension to their performances and each are very well cast.",Michael Clayton
69,Chris_Docker,An intelligent movie with reasonably wide appeal,8,30 September 2007,"During one scene, high powered corporate lawyer Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) practices answers for a coming interview. How do you achieve a work-life balance? The question, of course, could apply to us all.Ideals versus the reality of paying a mortgage? Trapped in a fast lifestyle. You maybe realise what you are doing is less than perfect. How easily can you get out? (One might also ask, how do serious actors balance worthwhile projects against box-office returns. A question that seems to prompt the fluctuating choices of stars like Swinton and Clooney.)By putting such an impasse at the heart of the movie, Michael Clayton becomes more than an edge-of-your-seat legal drama: it is a powerful psychological study that asks how far we will go to avoid facing unpalatable truths.Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is an in-house 'fixer.' He works for a big New York law firm. He sorts out their dirty work. For instance, a big client is involved in a hit-and-run. Or bad stories in the press that need smoothed out. Clayton is good at his job. But discontented. Divorce, gambling addiction, failed business venture, loads of debt. No easy way out, even if he wanted one.U-North is a large agrichemical company (think Constant Gardener). Their in-house chief counsel is Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton). Karen wants to see off a multi-million dollar class action suit. Clayton's firm is employed to wind it all up nicely for her. But Clayton's colleague, the brilliant Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), has an apparent mental breakdown. He strips off during a deposition. Then tries to sabotage the entire case. Clayton goes in to 'fix' things, yet he is gradually forced to admit how good the firm has maybe become at making wrong seem right.Much in the tradition of Erin Brockovitch or even Syriana, this is a film that tries to attack the respected authorities while still working within the format of mainstream cinema. (More cynically, it uses high production values and scenes that last no longer than the attention span of passive audiences  supposedly the length of a TV commercial break.)Directed by the man who wrote the Bourne trilogy, Michael Clayton racks up an intelligent suspense movie out of a plot nominally too dry for mass-market appeal. It reminds us of a world of imperatives we all succumb to. Maybe we don't always stop to question our job or its ethics too closely? Finish our overtime. Get reports ready for tomorrow. Close the deal. Have some private life. Let's leave philosophy for people with time on their hands. 'Nothing to do with me.'This is a moral-dilemma-movie that could easily have failed and doesn't. Two hours of lawyer-talk could be enough to bore anyone. But the screenplay cleverly contrasts high-intensity scenes and well-developed characters. Arthur's psychotic ranting. Clooney's impenetrable cool. Swinton's prepared polish. These are displayed in the boardroom. Or uncomfortably restrained emotion in family scenes. The high-stakes backroom card game. Or the simple, almost documentary-like portrayal of one of the plaintiffs claiming damages from U-North.Director Tony Gilroy is in no hurry to play all his cards. By the time murder enters the game, we are so engrossed that it seems like a natural progression.Cinematography by Oscar-nominated Robert Elswit is crucial. Right from the start, we are torn by fascinating contrasts. A long panning shot through expensive, empty offices is coupled with a sound-over of manic rambling. Suddenly the camera wanders into a busy room. An annoying reporter over the phone. And the overheard phrase, ""The time is now,"" brings everything together in the present. Shortly afterwards, a horrific scene in which Clayton is almost killed. Then flashback four days to unravel a 'smoking gun' that can overturn the lawsuit on which lives, careers and whole firms rely.At one point, a shadow on the lower right of the screen could almost be an audience member standing up. As it advances, we see it is Clooney. His 'reality-check' moment  one with which we have been subtly led to identify  then saves his life. The subsequent soul-searching and inner turmoil also provide one of Clooney's most rounded and complex performances to date. (Additional casting is spot-on, with Wilkinson and Swinton both excelling themselves.)Clayton's ability to ask himself difficult questions is matched by Crowder's knack for self-deception. It is a frightening depiction of the legal mastery of words when she gives instructions for the most abominable acts with total deniability.Although the overly obvious Blackberry product-placement annoyed me slightly, I found Michael Clayton a satisfying film without any of the usual over-simplified characters. Threads are pulled together a bit too conveniently towards the end, but it succeeds in never seeming contrived. If you have always put off thinking a little too deeply about where your own life is heading, it might even give you a necessary nudge. But as all-round entertainment to a thinking audience, Michael Clayton is one of this summer's better movies.",Michael Clayton
70,MaxBorg89,"A bit slow at first, but manages to hook the viewer when it needs to",8,7 October 2007,"It's late at night, and everyone working at a major law firm in New York is there to settle some fundamental issues. Only one person is missing: he is somewhere else, handling another problem and then going back home. He stops on the way to look at the landscape and possibly think about what he has achieved. All of a sudden, his car blows up, leaving him alive by miracle.Such a prologue would suggest this is the latest spy movie, right? Wrong. We're talking about a legal drama, a slow-burning thriller that allows George Clooney to show his darker side again after his wounded, Oscar-winning turn in Syriana. The former ER star has always favored socially relevant pictures over blockbusters, using his earnings from crowd-pleasers like Ocean's Eleven or Spy Kids to make sure Good Night, and Good Luck, among others, got made. By his own admission, Ocean's Thirteen, which wasn't bad, was on his schedule just to grant Michael Clayton the financial backing it needed. Was it worth it? Yes.The man the title refers to, the guy Clooney portrays, is the same person whose car explodes. The film subsequently moves back in time, showing the events that led to the attempt on Clayton's life. It all has to do, apparently, with his peculiar job: Michael is a fixer, one who erases and constructs evidence, keeping clients out of jail and earning his boss Marty (Sydney Pollack) a load of cash. This time, he has been asked to take care of a fellow ""garbage man"", Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson): he was supposed to make sure everything went smoothly in an important case involving U/North, a chemical company, but all of a sudden he has taken the opposite side, starting to gather proof against U/North and behave bizarrely (stripping in public, for instance); this situation is a pain in the neck for Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), the company's legal adviser, and for Marty, neither of whom can afford to let this matter go awry. Enter Clayton, whose task is to talk some sense into Arthur and get things back on track. As the days pass, however, Michael gets increasingly concerned about his future, wondering whether what he has been doing so far is the right thing.The legal world is a messy one, something we already knew thanks to John Grisham (referenced in the casting of Pollack, who directed The Firm). Michael Clayton, however, is not based on one of his works, but is the original creation of first-time director Tony Gilroy, who reportedly got the idea for the movie while doing research for his The Devil's Advocate screenplay. Given the quality of the latter, it's hard not to expect the same from Clayton. Alas, the great writer's lack of experience behind the camera shows in the first half-hour, as he struggles to find the right pace for his story: after the shocking introduction, the film proceeds quite slowly, offering tons of information and dialogue but little time to process the whole thing. Considering Gilroy wrote the breathless Jason Bourne movies, such stiffness is confusing.Once the explanatory bits are out of the way, though, the plot starts to flow more easily, allowing the characters to really interact instead of just sitting down and listening to some monologue about what's happening and why it's bad. Wilkinson, who has the most difficult role to play, delivers a competent performance, although Gilroy's decision not to show his previous deeds makes his ""redemption"" a bit hard to swallow. Pollack, in a part he could do in his sleep (see his similar work in Changing Lanes), discards clichés and goes for a sincere, believable characterization. Outranking them both is Swinton, whose purely British depiction of subtle yet tormented evil finds its match only in Clooney's painful intensity: fearlessly playing Clayton as he is meant to be shown (a cynical, calculating scumbag with a serious gambling addiction), he sets aside his trademark charms and conveys real sadness, doubt and ambiguity. Only in one scene does he let his movie star persona emerge, and that he manages to do so without ruining the picture's tone confirms his status as one of the smartest actors working in Hollywood.Overall, it is thanks to the priceless double act between Clooney and Swinton that Michael Clayton rises above average. Far from perfect, that's for sure (the script could have used a bit more polishing), but still smart and thoughtful.",Michael Clayton

72,davispittman,A masterful piece of cinema,9,1 April 2018,"Michael Clayton (2007) is a real piece of art, it hits every note spot on. There are certain things that I look for in a film, things i believe they must have in order for it to be a success. I look for correct casting, quality performances by the members of the cast, good script, and a satisfactory filmmaking style that fits that specific film. I can say with confidence that Michael Clayton fits the bill on every single thing I mentioned. Clooney gives a good performance as he always does, as does the ever talented Tilda Swinton (this was her Academy Award win). If you ask me, Tom Wilkinson comes out on top here as far as acting goes. He gives a fierce passionate performance. Wilkinson is a fantastic actor and he absolutely nails it here as a very crucial character in the plot. The script moves everything along at a fairly good pace, not too slow, and not fast either. I liked the pace and thought the runtime of two hours suited it well. towards the end things kinda speed it up, in an appropriate way, because everything is coming to a point. I loved the way they chose to end the film. It was raw and very dramatic, made for a grand finale to an exciting well done piece of art. 9/10 for Michael Clayton.",Michael Clayton
73,rooprect,"Send Lawyers, Guns and Money",9,13 March 2020,"The plot summary for this legal conspiracy thriller may sound like a cliché to you, but trust me, the film is the furthest thing from a cliché. As you watch this flick, instead of being swept away by the tense, complex story (which is hard not to be swept away by), pay close attention to the moral fiber, or lack thereof, of the 3 main characters. Watch for their subtle, nonverbal actions and mannerisms showing how each deals with reconciling pure evil with propriety, if that's even possible. If you notice the unique way, and the consequences, in which each of the 3 characters face the unfaceable, you will be blown away.That opening paragraph was a mouthful so let's downshift and talk about the characters & story real quick. ""Michael Clayton"" (George Clooney) is a fixer for a powerful law firm. He makes problems go away; that's his only job description. His friend ""Arthur"" (Tom Wilkinson) is a partner at the law firm who abruptly suffers a high profile nervous breakdown as he is defending U-North, a multinational corporation facing a lawsuit alleging some serious, SERIOUS misdeeds. And our 3rd character is ""Karen"" (Tilda Swinton) as the person in charge of U-North's misdeeds.All 3 characters find themselves neck deep in this huge mess, and they're all on the same team--or at least it begins that way--trying to cover up U-North's negligence involving loss of life and billions of dollars. Michael is the emotionless ""hit man"" in this equation, and George Clooney pulls off this role brilliantly, always seeming to be in control even though we know that his life is rapidly falling apart due to a number of nonrelated issues; Michael is ""the adult in the room"". In stark contrast, his friend Arthur loses his mind and does erratic things like stripping off all his clothes and ranting about spiritual ectoplasm like he's the next prophet. And our 3rd character, possibly the most complex and brilliantly played by Ms Swinton, is Karen who tries her best to be emotionless but we can tell by the pain on her face that she is living a hell far worse than anyone else.This film is a really slick analysis of human immorality from these 3 perspectives: control (Michael), insanity (Arthur), and to quote Thoreau ""quiet desperation"" (Karen). As these 3 philosophies clash, things get crazy and a few people may possibly end up dead by the time the story ends.The movie is expertly done without a single wasted scene, perfectly composed and intelligently written in a way that grabs our full attention from the first scene. The story begins near the end, then flashes back to 4 days prior, then leads us back to the end. And I gotta say, this made the sequence of events heart-poundingly suspenseful. No, it's not an action-packed rollercoaster like ""The Fugitive"", but even better, it's a quiet, suffocating thriller that gets thicker with every scene, reeling you in on a much deeper level than a typical action flick.And above all, this is a great character study, almost like a morality play, thanks to the amazing performances of our 3 main actors. There aren't many films that reach this kind of depth, but one that comes to mind is the 1957 classic ""Sweet Smell of Success"" with Burt Lancaster & Tony Curtis.In closing, I gotta quote the lyrics from the song in my title:""I'm hiding in Honduras
I'm a desperate man
Send lawyers, guns, and money
The s-- has hit the fan.""",Michael Clayton
74,3xHCCH,I Have Never Seen George Clooney So Good!,7,16 February 2008,"This is the third of the five Oscar Best Picture nominees that I have seen. I would not have expected this movie to be a Best Picture nominee at all if watched this last year. The build up of the movie is very slow. It only gains momentum in the middle and then it has you under its masterful grasp. The ending is quite neat though, even predictable, thus exposing the simplicity of the plot. However, it would also emphasize the excellence of the directorial style of Tony Gilroy (in his directorial debut) that makes the totality of this film transcend the limitations of the script.The acting was definitely excellent. The three main characters all play lawyers. All three were deservedly nominated for Oscars in acting.The star is definitely George Clooney. He was really very good here in a subtle and quiet way (so unlike the over-the-top style of Daniel Day Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood""). He plays a lawyer who is employed by a firm as a ""fixer"", someone who uses under the table methods to smooth out creases in the cases of other lawyers. Clooney deglamorizes himself here (if that's possible) in playing a sad, down-and-out character who gets caught in a high stakes legal case involving big business. He makes the audience forget his real life persona. That lingering close-up on his face as he rides a taxi at the end shows him going though an entire gamut of emotions without a word nor gesture--excellent.Tom Wilkinson, whom I have admired as an actor since ""In The Bedroom,"" is Arthur. He plays a big time defense lawyer who discovers that the firm he is defending, U-North, was actually killing people with its weed-killer products, and turns crazy in the process. His monologue about the sins of the company directed towards the agents whom he found out were bugging his apartment was a highlight of acting excellence.Tilda Swinton was not really an actress I liked from her past work. I will always picture her as the Snow Queen in the Narnia movie. This may be the only film that I have seen her in modern dress. Here, she plays the in-house attorney of U-North who had to resort to desperate measures to cover up for the sins of the company she works for. Cool on the surface, a bundle of nerves behind the scenes. Very good also.Compared with the other two nominees I have seen, this is actually more accessible to the regular viewer, since it is modern and the language used is clear. It is very effective as a character study. I am of the opinion though that its chances of winning Best Picture is a long shot. It lacks the epic feel that Oscar seems to love. The nomination alone may be its reward.",Michael Clayton

I would much preferred to just have it presented in one narrative time line without the flashbacks. I do however admire the effort to put this story on the screen and the films produced by Soderberg and Cloooney et al are to be commended for their comment on the current American business and political climate. in fact it made me realize how much I respect a good chase and intrigue political business drama. This film is deliberately quite ugly to watch, dull color and bleak chrome and cold in its art direction. Clooney is great as always and the dialog quite strong and somewhat entertaining... especially in all scenes with Tilda Swinton.

It is a magnetic film, with plenty of interesting moments, a lot of drama, and fine performances, in particular, Clooney's. There are times when one does question the choices of Wilkinson and Swindon, who have been flawless in other films but appear a bit forced here. Swinton has certainly managed to be quite impressive in other mediocre films, and one does expect more from the portrayal of an amoral, dangerous character. Her climatic scene suffers because of the way her character is written or is it performed? Wilkinson does wander in and out of the movie with some stellar moments, but it is certainly not the type of performance that fits here. Watching Clooney in control of the screen, sail smoothly across the various scenes, and hold the screen as the credits roll, is amazing, and there is only one actor that matches the quiet intensity that fuels Clooney's: Pollack.It is an intelligent thriller, with a couple of fun twists and some insight into the world of otherwise flawed people who love money and pretty much nothing else.

79,Jonny_Numb,Little more than a vain award-buzz generator,5,17 October 2007,"In the opening minutes of ""Michael Clayton,"" our titular character (played by George Clooney, of course) is browbeat by a poker player, boasting of a business conquest our hero is smarting over; he proceeds to visit a screaming rich man who wants a hit-and-run incident covered up; and, as dawn breaks, our sleep-deprived protagonist watches 3 horses calmly line up on a hilltop while his car explodes in the background. To liven things up, we are quickly informed that these events are the culmination of the events of the previous four days. It's a shame, then, that the events that preceded this weren't nearly as exciting.""Michael Clayton"" once again finds Hollywood in bed with the characters (and plots, apparently) it cannot live without: the Reptilian Corporate Overlords (represented here by Tilda Swinton, long since typecast as a cold-eyed ice queen), Flawed Do-Gooder (Clooney), and Mentally Ill Know-It-All (Tom Wilkinson). The dilemma that unites the three: RCO is privy to knowledge that her Evil Company distributed a product with a strain of chemical that ultimately wound up killing more than 400 civilians; MIKIA knows this, but is so frantic and paranoid (in addition to stripping down in public to prove it) that few believe him; and FDG is the ""fixer"" who has a personal attachment to MIKIA, and is led to a Turning Point where loyalty is called into question.To say the plot ""is nothing new"" is an understatement. Even the title shimmers with an embossed sense of self-importance (though it could also double for a men's clothing chain); one part award-buzz generator, one part vanity piece for George Clooney, ""Michael Clayton"" banks on performance strength more than anything else, attempting a ""mainstream naturalism"" that doesn't work because all the interlacing plot threads feel artificially contrived. In an effort to pad out Clayton's FDG character, writer Tony Gilroy (who also directed) heaps on a subplot about a costly failed business venture, a recovering drug-addict brother, a brother-in-law cop implicated in Clayton's activities, and interludes with Clayton's son (a precocious chap whose current reading fascination becomes a plot gimmick) that never come off as anything more than melodrama masquerading as character shading. Characters, subplots, and monetary amounts eventually become a tangled distraction when matched against the undertow of the larger, more familiar (and predictable) beast at work here.That being said, the characterizations all feel rather subduedunlike other films of this type, I never really felt fully engaged during ""Michael Clayton"" because the script never seems dynamic enough to transcend their rote parts: Clooney plays Clayton with fewif anydramatic shifts, and Gilroy relies on two achingly symbolic scenes (the horses on the hill; a long static shot of Clayton in the backseat of a cab) to convey his ""change"" as a character. Swinton has the obligatory task of choosing a wardrobe to match her icy persona, putting on a veneer of control before her RCOs, and frequently swooning with panic (she deserves better). And Wilkinson, as the MIKIA, may be an accurate portrait of mental illness, but his character simply got on my nerves. Even director Sydney Pollack, who brought a charismatic persona to otherwise mediocre films like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" or ""Changing Lanes"" is curiously bland here.While I haven't seen ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" I know it was a highly-praised effort from Clooney, and ""Michael Clayton"" seems to be piggybacking on its critical success; and while Clooney has that rare mix of on-screen presence and off-camera intelligence and wit, the good intentions behind this film ultimately drown in a sea of mediocrity and familiarity, to the point where the closing revelation is merely a plot machination we're waiting on from frame one, as opposed to something that blows our minds.

The events portrayed in the scenes which unfold the scandal is also quite seldom done in movies as far as I know. The addition of the mental condition of the character Arthur really complicate things up. That makes it a more enjoyable story. But there are too many unresolved plot holes that gaped widely at the end, such as Michael's kid, his debt condition, and his relationship with his brother. Also, beside Michael Clayton, the other characters were not developed enough that the complete story feels a bit empty here and there.Clooney and Swinton did a great job. acting here.

The dialog was mundane, the scenes were too slow and every situation seemed out of place. I was surprised at the performance by George Clooney. He looked bored and his emotional stages were over-exaggerated. To those who left the theater after 20 minutes, I salute you. I was forced to sit through two hours of this painful movie. I was hoping for a surprising ending at least, but no it ends with Michael Clayton (Clooney) hopping into a taxi and driving off in to the sunset, yawn! I'll never get my two hours back again and it's all thanks to you, ""Michael Clayton"". Tony Gilroy, I liked you when you made those Bourne movies, but you're no John Grisham. I advice you, Gilroy to read a Grisham novel before ever directing another courtroom drama ever again.What I hated about this movie? Where should I start? Well for starters there's this creepy, voice-over in the opening scenes as this guy from a law firm in Milwakee drags a cart through the hallways. What's the point of that? Need I ask. First we meet Michael Clayton, sulking over losing his tavern over a stupid game of poker. He leaves the underground premises and drives over to Westchester where some top-notch clients goes hysterical after running over a pedestrian. Still moaning, Clayton drive further ahead to look at some horses, situated on an abandoned road. He gets out of the car to get a better glance of the horses, ans suddenly, his car explodes.We go back four days before this event takes place and we discover that Clayton is the defender to this bigwig lawyer named Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), whose also a bit mentally unstable. Arthur is a interested in his young client, and also Clayton's young son, who's a very talented writer who writes fantasy novels. Edens is supposed to be defending a fertilizing company that specializes in manufacturing pesticides, but are potentially harmful for the environment. Wow! Big surprise! The banal ending has the environmentally unfriendly company hire Russian hit men to bring down Edens and to go after Clayton, then in trite fashion,we go back to the start of the film, where a hit-man rigs Clayton's car causing the explosion. So know Clayton, casually drops his wallet and keys in the car as it explodes manipulating us into thinking he's dead,but he's just staring at horses. Next we find our drab hero, Clayton back from New York and spars with the pesticide company's representative, and offers her $10 million and shows that Eden had all the legal proceedings documented against this company in a pamphlet binder of one of Clayton's son's book cover. The gullible woman takes it and gets arrested right on the spot. Geez! What a suitable ending. NOT! Is Clayton an undercover cop going incognito as an attorney? Nobody knows either.

Well, I can only guess, but I'm pretty sure it's because it requires a viewer's full attention throughout a lot of talky scenes, scenes that are very crucial to the film. The film contains little to no action scenes and I can see how some people may be turned off by this. In fact, the film isn't for everyone, but those of you who are willing to sit and watch and give your attention to the film, you'll be rewarded.In order to pull off a good thriller, films like these should have some good performances by the actors themselves. Maybe the three Oscar nominations from the three main actors in here should give a clear indication of how successful the movie is. George Clooney gives off a great performance along with Tom Wilkinson. There's a dramatic monologue from Wilkinson that comes the second the movie starts that is done so well. However, Tilda Swinton is the one that reigns on top. She gives a performance so determined and filled with conviction that it shouldn't be a surprise that she won an Oscar for her role.I'll admit it. I usually don't watch these types of thrillers where people talk in scenes for long periods of time but I think they're starting to grow on me. This film marks the directorial debut of Tony Gilroy, which is quite surprising to me because of how well the movie turned out, unusual for a directorial debut but Gilroy seems to know what he's doing, so look out for him in the future. MICHAEL CLAYTON is very talky but it's never boring. If you would like to watch a well written thriller with some fine performances, this film is for you.",Michael Clayton
87,bob-rutzel-1,It was okay,6,20 April 2008,"Michael Clayton (Clooney) is a ""janitor"", a lawyer who gets clients out of trouble without going to court. There is an ongoing Class Action suit that his company seems to have the edge in until things go bad.I would have liked this better if that Class Action suit was explained somewhat better somewhere in the beginning of the movie. Things moved so fast in the beginning and another janitor case was mixed in with the Class Action suit, it was hard to know what was going on. But, eventually, it all got sorted out.near the end of it all. I wouldn't call this a thriller or even a suspense story. I was more concerned trying to figure out what was going on that the suspense angle was non-existent. So in that case, there was no caring for any of the characters, even Michael Clayton, who seemed to know what to do, yet I trusted him. And, MC had baggage: divorced, a failed business, gambling problem, and still I did not care and that was because he was always going forward, trying to make his life better, not dwelling on the past. Yes, I would have nominated George Clooney for a Best Actor award. He is good and can carry a story, but he didn't get it. However, they nominated Tilda Swinton for Best Actress in a supporting role and she got it. Go figure. Get out. After seeing this movie, I would not have nominated her for anything. She is okay, but an Oscar performance? I don't think so. This movie was also nominated for Best Picture. I wouldn't go that far, it was okay, but not Oscar material. Seems Oscar material has new standards these days. One more thing, this movie was also nominated for a Music Award. What? I don't recall any music being played at all. I was so busy trying to figure out what was really going on that I didn't hear a thing. Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes, there was some, not a lot",Michael Clayton
88,bandw,Worth two viewings,9,6 August 2008,"There are several reasons to give this a second viewing. One is to savor the performances. Whoever did the casting for this deserves high praise, since there is not a false note struck by any of the actors. Offhand I can't think of a better person than George Clooney to play the world-weary middle-aged Michael Clayton who is facing moral, financial, and existential crises. Clayton works for an upscale New York law firm and, while he is a licensed lawyer, he doesn't really practice law but rather specializes in being a middle-man in cleaning up messy situations. He makes a living by having contacts with lawyers, cops, politicians, and so forth, and knowing who the right contact is for a job. Clooney gives a nuanced and believable performance of this man who is very much at a crossroads in his life.Clooney's great performance is just one among many. Tom Wilkinson playing Clayton's bipolar colleague Arthur (who has gone off his meds) convinces you of his madness. But once you see what is driving Arthur's madness, what he says and does is understandable. The content and rhythms of his rants reminded me of an exaggeration of some of Andre Gregory's flights of fancy in ""My Dinner with Andre."" And then there is Tilda Swinton who deserved her Academy Award - a truly awe-inspiring performance. The list goes on: Sydney Pollock could take pride in his penultimate performance, Austin Wiliams as Clayton's young son Henry is a natural, Michael O'Keefe is perfect as the ultimate iniquitous lawyer. I was particularly impressed with Sean Cullen as Clayton's detective brother. Another reason for a second viewing is to clarify, or pick up on, some things you might have missed on first viewing. A second viewing shows that there is really no trickery in the presentation, while on first viewing it took me awhile to figure out what was going on at the law firm and who all the characters were. And not having to pay such close attention to the story I was able to pick up on some things that flew right over my head the first time. For example, Clayton's stopping and approaching the horses on the hill is motivated by an image he sees in going through Arthur's loft. And you can better appreciate the care that went into the framing and lighting of a lot of the shots. On second viewing plot holes usually surface in most thrillers, but this story holds together quite well.There are some remarkably strong scenes. There is a scene where Clayton is driving with his son and, sensing Henry's state of mind, stops the car and tells him in a direct way some things that the kid will remember and be supported by for the rest of his life. Love of a father for a son is expressed in many ways, and that scene in the car was a powerful example of one way. The tense scene between Michael and Arthur in the alley, that ends with Michael's saying, ""I'm not the enemy,"" and Arthur's response of, ""Then what are you?"" is a knockout. The scene where Swinton is discussing with one of her hired hands how to handle a very unpleasant situation, and she is deciding whether to ""do the other thing,"" is wonderfully written and performed.The musical score accentuates but does not intrude.This well-crafted examination of greed, power, and fear in high places, and the effects those powerful forces have on the participants, makes ""Michael Clayton"" an absorbing movie.",Michael Clayton
89,intelearts,"Just OK, and definitely not as great as I was expecting",6,21 January 2008,"Michael Clayton is not quite as smart as it would like to be: yes, it has intelligence and meat to it, but lacks a sense that this could and would have survived without the coincidences and subplots that litter the screen.The plot is well handled. Big corporate, U Growth, who discover the lead lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) for their retained firm, where Michael Clayton works as a fixer of all things that need fixing, has flipped out and gone doolaley, causing big problems for all involved. Michael Clayton, in trying to help the lawyer and the law firm finds himself on the wrong end of the corporate machine. I personally could have done without the hit men and that side of the film struck me as a cop out.At its core Clooney gives a nicely understated and fine performance as the man the lawyers turn to when things go wrong. Tilda Swinton as U Growth's chief counsel is good as portraying a woman who needs her job to maintain her sense of self (And her and Jodie Foster could easily be sisters based on this...) and shows herself a multifaceted and complex character. Where Michael Claydon is great is in the small stuff and the corporate world, where it lacks is in the wider world around it. Overall, I get it, but I wasn't convinced that it made great cinema. I came away kind of unimpressed. it didn't really feel involving and yet it tries to - the camera work is too tight at times, and overall I felt the pacing was contrived to be slow, which does fit the feel of the film in one sense, but also made me feel that there could have been more to it than this.Not as great as it could have been.",Michael Clayton

91,saadgkhan,Fantastic,7,9 April 2012,"Michael Clayton - CATCH IT (B+) Michael Clayton is a thriller with cause, it shows how corporate world work & protect itself from losing their reputation & billions in a law suit. George Clooney did a fantastic job as cunning & ruthless fixer. I even didn't know that there are fixers in law firms who give their ruthless opinions about the matters to save rich people from getting into unnecessary troubles. Tilda Swinton won Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in Michael Clayton. She was defiantly great but my problem is with the length of her character. She didn't get as much on screen time as she should had. Overall, Michael Clayton is a good thriller defacing the corporate world. George Clooney, Tilda Swinton $ Tom Wilkinson's performances are admirable. Go watch it!",Michael Clayton
92,wisewebwoman,Edge of Yer Seat Stuff,9,22 February 2008,"This is a brilliant film made by the first time director and long time gifted screen-writer, James Gilroy.It requires more than a little work by the viewer as the clues are subtly placed in flashback form from the moment of a bomb going off in the main character's car. Reminiscent of a good Hitchcock film. George Clooney excels in this, from the first time we see him at a heavy-duty gambling table to the last frame, where he sits in a taxi-cab riding aimlessly around New York, processing all that has happened around and to him in the last four days. I won't throw down any spoilers as this is a movie where one spoiler could upset the whole plot. Suffice to say is that like all of G.C.'s winning films this is one about morals and ethics and particularly the lack of either in corporations and their enablers (law firms, accounting firms, stock brokers). Human life is of very little value and everything can be fixed for a price. I particularly liked the way Michael the chief fixer of the law firm, is portrayed as a whole person, a brother, a father, a divorcée, a gambler with a pile of debt that is crushing him. Every exchange he has feels real, every social interaction even with his son where he is more than often distracted and detached. Tilda Swinton as an ambitious corporate lawyer is breathtaking. Her attention to her faux self, the one she presents to board-rooms, is real and authentic. This is a woman who teeters on the brink of her own success all the time and who has completely lost touch with her own humanity. Tom Wilkinson playing Arthur, who has a breakdown (or does he?) is wonderful. Every scene he is in is memorable. I loved the cinematography by Robert Elswith who also did Good Night and Good Luck, I believe. Subtle and haunting. Bravo to all, Not to be missed - I would see it again. 9 out of 10.",Michael Clayton
93,leftbanker-1,Posivtively Riveting from Start to Finish,10,6 August 2017,"This is one of the most intelligent thrillers you are ever going to see on film. Michael Clayton is one of my favorite films of all time. The line-up of all-star actors should make this movie a clinic for anyone even thinking about acting as a career. The writing is so precise that even the off-hand dialogue is remarkable. Just listen to the phone conversations and the comments people make to off-screen characters. There is no filler.I can guarantee that you won't find a thriller with such a well-developed protagonist as this movie and the director does it by saying so little. We have the briefest glimpse of Michael's relationship to his family, yet it says a lot about him. The same is true of the bond between he and his boss played by Sydney Pollack who is at least as good of an actor as he was a director, and he was a great director. He is fabulous in this film.Tom Wilkinson really landed on my radar with the role he has here. I'm sure that I'd seen him before but I never paid much attention to actors' names.The story is told in jerky cutbacks. I've now seen the movie so many times that I can't remember how this affected me on the first viewing. Now that I just saw it for the umpteenth time, I think that the storyline is brilliant.There are so many iconic and memorable scenes in Michael Clayton it's almost impossible to list them all without just going from beginning to end and writing them all down. The card game scene is creepy and you just know that this sort of sordid action really happens in NY. The part where Michael goes to the rich a-hole's house about the hit and run is riveting and completely identifies Michael's role in that prestigious law firm.The ultra-creepy corporate snuff squad that is called in to fix the problem was, for me, one of the most compelling aspects of the movie. They are as cold and calculating as pest control workers. This movie makes me believe that this sort of service is available, for a price.The ending is so electrifying and satisfying that it's hard for me to think of another movie that rates this high on endings. Tilda Swindon is fabulous in the role of a corporate hack in way, way over her head.",Michael Clayton
94,KUAlum26,Would've been nearly forgotten were it not for critics and connoisseurs,9,13 March 2008,"There's close to nothing ""sexy"" about this movie. In other words,there's hardly any sexual activity (unless you consider the mention of it AS activity), there's only a token amount of violence(much of which was showcased in the trailers) and the issue/agenda/crisis/conflict in question is not something that can be easily spelled out in a thirty-second ad or even a one minute theatrical trailer. It's no wonder that this was not much of a box office hit when released last fall.I'd lament the previous stuff just mentioned were it not for the fact that,after seeing it,I know that this is a very adult,sober and intelligent story(written by the director,long-time scribe and first time helm Tony Gilroy)and that basically this probably wasn't even really MEANT to be a widely grasped,popularity-sucking film.The title character is a low-level ""mop-up guy"" for a powerful NYC law firm and he(George Clooney,muted and cool) and his latest assignment for the firm is to ""reign in"" the chief litigator (Tom Wilkinson),who lost it during a class action deposition in Milwaukee. As he's trying to do the usual damage control,a corporate rep named Crowder (Tilda Swinton, intentionally zombie-like?) tries to ""fix"" the problem that's perceived to be uncontrollable from Clayotn's firm. Lost among the acting nominees Clooney,Wilkinson and Swinton (and kind of unfairly so) are Sydney Pollack as the soulless senior partner of the firm and Austin Williams as Clayton's bright and insightful grade school age son.This is a movie for people who like their films to have story and trust the audience is mature enough to understand that problems,crises and conflict can take place under VERY ordinary circumstances,with consequences and effects that go much deeper into the psyche and can have quiet but undeniably lasting effects. Perhaps it's overstating this to say that this movie would've been ""nearly forgotten"" if it hadn't been for the high praise it received (not to mention the award nominations) but I feel like this show was probably NOT going to yield popular return on it's own simple release. A shame,I suppose,but an honest estimation.",Michael Clayton
95,antoniotierno,well executed thriller,7,14 October 2007,"Michael Clayton, showing George Clooney at his best, is a brilliant drama and insightful story. It's compelling and ends the best way, with an engaging confrontation between the two lead actors. Clooney played other serious characters in other serious films but this one is different for its raising some difficult moral questions and for packing the anticorporation hero with a morally confusing touch. Would also say this piece of film-making got something different from other stories of the same genre since situations and moments of this amoral world are rendered with tension filled sounds and strange atmospheres. On the whole, the story is provocative and gripping at the same time.",Michael Clayton
96,bobsgrock,Definitely one of the best of 2007,9,11 June 2008,"In retrospect, Michael Clayton deserves its place among the very best films of a very strong year of 2007. It may not have been as intense as No Country for Old Men or There Will Be Blood, but it nevertheless is able to hold suspense for an entire two hours with very little action. This is possible with great writing and directing from first-timer Tony Gilroy and superb acting by everyone in the cast, especially the leads by George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and the late Sydney Pollack.All other aspects aside, it really is the writing here that holds this picture together. From the opening monologue by Arthur Edens, suspense begins to build and it may lag around a bit at times, but you still care about these characters and their situations as the film draws to a close. Clooney is very good here as a world-weary ""fixer"" attorney who as seen it all, is tired of his job, and is trying to deal with all the personal problems he has on top of this enormous prospect popping up at work. Tom Wilkinson may give the film's best performance as the crazy, erratic Edens who suddenly begins to advocate against the very case he was trying to defend. Tilda Swinton is solid as well, and Sydney Pollack goes out on top with a memorable performance as the head of the law firm.It is a great film and it deserved all the awards it got and maybe some more. Still, without all that it is just a lean, well-made picture that gets straight to the point and doesn't try to bang us over the head with a lot of nonsense and propaganda. If you can't stand great dialogue and character study, don't waste your time or money. If you want to watch a very fine piece of work and one of the best pictures of 2007, Michael Clayton is that and much more.",Michael Clayton
97,Terrell-4,What we've always suspected: High-priced lawyers are the real criminals,7,27 January 2008,"It's unlikely that Michael Clayton will ever be shown in one of Harvard Law School's required ethics-for-lawyers classes (if it has any). We learn far more about the ethical practices of high-priced Wall Street law firms and the corporate lawyers who hire them than the whole well-dressed, well-manicured and well-housed gang would want us to know. And despite the McGuffin being an obvious bit of Hollywood political correctness, and despite being too long with too many extraneous acting bits thrown in for George Clooney, the movie's star, Michael Clayton still delivers the goods as a solid legal conspiracy thriller. Except for all those bits -- Michael's relationship with his angelic son, Michael's relationship with his druggie brother, Michael's relationship with a nice gang messenger, Michael's relationship with poker and Michael's angst over not being made a partner -- the mechanics of the conspiracy and the quality of the acting carries us along. I just wish the movie had been tighter and shorter. George Clooney as Clayton does a superior job that keeps us involved with the story. His job at his law firm has been to clean up messes. He's no miracle worker, he says, he's a janitor. Equally fine performances come from Tom Wilkinson as an attack lawyer, a partner in the law firm where Clayton works, who goes off the rails (when he goes off his meds) and, of all things, starts to help the good guys; Tilda Swinton as the murderous chief counsel for a huge chemical firm which produces an insecticide with an unfortunate side effect, cancer; and Sidney Pollack as the law firm's head, a man who knows what it takes to insure the bills are paid and that he and his lawyers get their bonuses. It's not long before Clayton finds himself up to his torts in hardball lawyering as he tries to deal with a friend who seems to be in the middle of a mental collapse. All the while he's pressured by the needs of a multi-million dollar criminal suit against that chemical company, which his firm is defending. It doesn't help when a couple of blonde assassins enter the scene. The PC nature of the McGuffin -- killer chemicals sold by a huge industrial company -- reeks of Hollywood righteousness. For me, it was irritating. I certainly don't recommend trusting big companies any more than I'd recommend trusting high priced lawyers, but I wanted a thriller, not a lecture by rich Hollywood writers and stars. Besides, Erin Brockovich had already mined that chemical load earlier. To the movie's credit, not much time is spent with the McGuffin itself. It provides the cause of the plot, but it could have been just about anything. What helps us forget the PC nature of the McGuffin is the quality acting by Clooney, Wilkinson, Swinton and Pollack. There's not a scene in the movie that does not have at least one of them in it. Separately and together in any combination, they hook us into whatever plot development they're showing us. The lessons I drew from Michael Clayton: --If you're the head of a law firm, make sure your lawyers stay on their meds. --If you're a lawyer, there are better things for your career than murdering a person's body...such as murdering the person's reputation and character. And it pays just as well. --If you can ignore the message of the McGuffin and minimize your involvement in all the angst in Michael Clayton's life, Michael Clayton the movie is darn good.",Michael Clayton
98,Philby-3,A thinking middle-aged person's thriller,8,21 October 2007,"Tony Gilroy, hitherto a scriptwriter of tightly plotted thrillers (the ""Bourne"" series), has served up as director/screenwriter a complex and carefully structured film that could be described as an ""intellectual"" thriller but is as much a character driven story as a thriller. It will have zero appeal to anyone under 30 but older viewers who find themselves wondering why they keep on working for ethically challenged employers will feel a great deal of empathy with two of the main characters the eponymous (love that word  it means his name is in the title) Michael Clayton, played by George Clooney, and Arthur Edens, played by Tom Wilkinson.Both work for a huge (600 lawyer) New York law firm, Kenner Bach and Leeden. After 15 years there Clayton is the firm's fixer (or ""janitor""), though oddly has not made partner. He is burdened by debt from a failed restaurant venture with his feckless brother. He has a gambling habit. His marriage has failed and he struggles to relate to his young son. He is also starting to get the impression that he is working for the bad guys, U-North, a big agri-chemical company the firm is acting for in a class action over a crop spray that killed people instead of bugs. The company is as guilty as hell. Edens, the firm's top litigator who has spent six years on the case, having seen the smoking memo, knows he is on the wrong side and being bipolar flips out in spectacular fashion. Clayton goes in to ""clean up"" but the client, in the form of its general counsel, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), has her own clean-up team most definitely not bound by legal ethics.You have to pay attention at the start- most of the film is in flashback- and sometime the pace is a little slow, but the conclusion is thoroughly satisfying. It's George Clooney's film. No longer is he Gorgeous George, with a twinkle in his eye, always on top of the situation, but a worried, tired, middle-aged professional who sees his life slipping away as a result of his bad choices, the biggest of which was to switch out of public prosecuting and go to work for Kenner & co.. He is a good-looking failure, in fact. I'd give him an Oscar for his performance. Tom Wilkinson keeps us guessing as to whether he is crazy-cunning, or just crazy. Sydney Pollack, now 73, gives a virile performance as Marty Bach (another piece of eponymy), senior partner in the firm. Marty, at least, is quite straightforward about what his firm is doing (""this case stank from the start  how do you think we pay the rent?""). Tilda Swinton gives an interesting portrait of U-North's general counsel and chief villainess. She plays her in an oddly hesitant way  behind her façade of cool efficiency she is profoundly insecure to the extent she throws up in the bathroom before important meetings and endlessly practices her presentations in front of any available mirror. She too, is a victim of corporate culture, but for her there is no way out.This isn't a film for action buffs but it tells a thoughtful story and features some bravura acting. There are some loose ends and redundancies in the plot but the film rings true because its character's situations, if not the characters themselves, are familiar to most of us over thirty. Unfortunately many will stay trapped, but George gives the rest of us some hope.",Michael Clayton
99,Richie-67-485852,Mikee,7,11 November 2017,"Clooney can carry a movie and make us believe the character no problem. He does his work here and it is satisfying. Along the way, we get a decent story, some suspense and even a few questions but take heart it is all answered in the end leaving us content. Interesting take on being called a ""fixer"" which I am sure most attorneys qualify for to some degree. To be able hush something up, play it down or have it dismissed is worth paying for and there is a market for that no problem. Notice too that there is a lawsuit in this movie with the stakes being about three billion dollars and to what ends or limits people go to for that type of money is portrayed. It never fails to bring out the worse in people. So does power of which this movie demonstrates. I actually knew of attorney for a very powerful man whose son committed a murder-rape. It made all the papers and was tragic to read about. The attorney could do nothing to help his son but the man he worked for could. One day, not only did this disappear out of the newspapers after a few weeks but also went off the radar screens everywhere. It was fixed! That is what fixers do and you learn that everything in life is negotiable. Its finding that way that is daunting but doable. Have something to eat while watching and then choose a snack to offset the tension here and there at times. Include a tasty drink too. One last thing...they could have come up with a better title",Michael Clayton
100,jaredmobarak,Is that the answer to the multiple choice question of me?Michael Clayton,8,13 October 2007,"The man behind the scripts for the Bourne trilogy (and The Cutting Edge) has decided to step into the director's chair for his new film Michael Clayton. Along with an A-list producing crew (Sydney Pollack, Steven Soderbergh, Anthony Minghella) Tony Gilroy has assembled a brilliant cast of big names and familiar faces. After the action-packed Matt Damon-starrers he decided to go more psychological in the thriller category. It would be tough for a first-time director to choreograph extended fight sequences, and credit him for leaving that to the professionals. This film relies on the acting and tight story of internal espionage between a multi-billion dollar corporation and the law firm that defends it. While containing many elements keeping it in the mainstreamnumerous coincidences are necessary for the film to workeven when you know something is going to happen, Gilroy keeps the pace edge of your seat, allowing even the obvious to have a successful payoff.In a nutshell, the story tells of a law firm's top defense attorney growing a conscience. After six years of his life defending a client that most likely did knowingly kill 500 people with pesticide, he stops taking his medication and decides to cleanse himself of the filth he feels covers his body. This breakdown comes at a crucial moment in the case as evidence has turned up proving the U-North company had knowledge of the destructive qualities of their work. Because of this, we are introduced to the ""fixers"" of both sides, becoming involved to set things right. Both Tilda Swinton and George Clooney are fantastic in their roles as Karen Crowder of U-North and Michael Clayton of Kenner Bach Law respectively. They each need to start uncovering what went wrong and think of ways to rectify the situation. Although they are essentially on the same side, neither feels the need to let the other know what they are doing to clean up the mess.At the crux of the tale is the question of how far one is willing to go before morality has to eventually set in. The mental breakdown of the lead attorneyTom Wilkinson at his finest, turning on a dime from crazed to professional at one point in a phenomenal confrontation with Clooney in an alleyproves that a man who spends his entire adult life helping keep murderers out of jail can one day find the light. Seeing one of the victim's suffering, along with the evidence that could blow the case wide open, finally brings him to the cusp of flipping sides. As for Michael Clayton, Clooney is on retainer to fix problems, something he has done for Wilkinson's character in the past. He never quite knows the whole story because he doesn't need to; his job is to keep his old friend under control. However, Swinton's General Counsel has no second thoughts on what side of the law she is on. Able to squash any second thoughts or conscience that appears to be fighting its way to the surface, she does whatever is necessary to gain control over the case again. The question then becomes, will her vicious tactics eventually awaken the sleeping giant inside Clooney, or will he remain oblivious to the real problem and just take his money to pay off a brother's debt and go home to his son? Although we are given moments of contrivance, a phone call to Clooney as he leaves a poker game; a field of horses that looks like a picture in his son's favorite book, which coincidentally is a main point in Wilkinson's evolution post-meltdown; the arrival of the case's main victims in NY at just the right moment, Gilroy still manages to make it all work. The pacing is perfect, in my opinion, and thus keeps you anticipating the next move, helping to allow one to see past the easy bridges of the plot. From the getgo you will probably have an idea in your head for how it all will play out, yet the journey still delivers with high tension. A lot is going on in Clayton's life, events that would make a lesser man buckle, but this janitor has the gumption to stick through to the end in order to set things right for his brothers, his old friend, the case's innocent victims, and himself. Whether you accept all that happens or not, the film is a ride worth taking. If for nothing but the final confrontation between Clooney and Swinton, a powerhouse sequence that both deliver the goods on, the movie is one to checking out.",Michael Clayton
101,classicalsteve,"Intelligent Thriller that Makes its Audience Decipher, Reason, and Think",10,9 March 2008,"""Michael Clayton"" is a rare film that actually challenges its audience rather than just spoon feeding lots and lots of car chases, body brawls, and shoot-outs. This film doesn't just suggest that you try and figure out the many layers of story and plot that must be peeled back like a large but mysterious onion. The film insists upon the viewer's participation, which might give other types of film-goers slight pause who want everything to be spilled out. In short, nothing is made clear until the very end, which is as it should be. Part of the fun is trying to make sense of the larger puzzle.You might have guessed that describing the storyline/plot is not easy to do in 26 words or less. But essentially, the story revolves around the title character, played with haunting subtlety by George Clooney in one of his best performances, who is the ""janitor"" of a large and prestigious law firm in New York. No, he doesn't work in the wash room. He's a former prosecuting attorney who ""cleans up"" the messes made by other clients, or even members of their own firm, when they get into legal trouble that the firm wants to keep at arms' length. He deals with the raw and dirt-filled problems of the firm's biggest clients, people they need to keep out of prison so the firm can keep collecting huge legal fees. When the movie begins, we see him in action with a client who was involved in a hit-and-run. Clooney insists they need a special attorney for him, but not someone in the firm.The thrust of the story is Clayton finding himself in the middle of the mess of messes involving a three-billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against one of their biggest clients: a company that manufactures a weed-killing pesticide that also has the unfortunate side-affect of taking out farmers as well. Their cracker-jack attorney, Arthur Edens, who is the most brilliant mind in the firm but also the most unstable as he is a manic depressive, grows a conscience when he hears a deposition made by a little girl from one of the farms recounting the death of her father. Edens loses it at the deposition in a manic episode and literally disrobes in front of the other attorneys, and a camera, and runs naked out into the street, all the while propagating the injustice of the legal system.Clayton is sent out to handle Edens but finds a myriad of clues that something larger involving the firm and the weed-killing company is looming. Simultaneously, Edens becomes elusive, avoiding Clayton, who keeps trying to reign Edens back into the firm to finish the preparation for the defense of the lawsuit. When Clayton realizes that something else is going on, he becomes a kind of self-appointed private detective to unravel the mystery, all the while trying to keep his head and finances above water.A brilliant film all around with an equally good performance by Tom Wilkinson as Arthur Edens in a role that is strangely reminiscent of the Howard Beale character played by Peter Finch in the cutting-edge 1976 classic ""Network"", directed by Sydney Pollack who just happens to play Marty Bach, the head of the law firm in ""Michael Clayton"". If you want a film to contemplate, this is the one for you. If movies with too much intelligence make you feel stupid, you better stick with Die Hard IV.",Michael Clayton
102,vitaleralphlouis,A Lawyer Without a Courtroom!,8,12 October 2007,"MICHAEL CLAYTON is an excellent and instantly-involving movie -- a bone tossed by Hollywood at the long-neglected over-21 audience -- but definitely NOT a 10; not one of the all time best.George Clooney plays the clean-up man, the janitor, the guy who fixes problems for the big shots, corporate or otherwise. I don't remember his ever playing a role as good as this one. Frankly, all the players are excellent, the script is first rate, the editing and camera work are well above average.Clooney is known as a big liberal, indeed he announced just today he's NOT running for president; but he DOES NOT herein force his politics on the audience on their dime. Liberals beware: There is no political spin in this movie at all, so you might be disappointed.This was the second consecutive grown-up movie we've gone to; both at Wadshington DC's historic single screen AVALON THEATRE. Seeing a good movie at a real theater, not a multiplex, could become a habit. Try it if you can.",Michael Clayton
103,rupie,Not as good as the hype says,5,25 February 2008,"******** May Contain Spoilers ******* All the hype and critical acclaim given to this movie led me to believe I was in for a stellar cinematic experience but having gone all the way to the end I believe the movie has a few major flaws. Both of us watching it found that the movie, especially at the beginning, was almost deliberately obscure; it seemed almost to go out of its way to puzzle and confuse the viewer. Perhaps this was done in a misguided attempt to add ""depth;"" at any rate, more respect for the concept of linear storytelling would have been appreciated by us. Secondly, as has been stated by other viewers, the idea that Clayton can fake his death by tossing his effects into the flaming car is laughable; anyone who has watched a few episodes of ""Law and Order"" knows that at least some body parts are required. Third, the movie is too ready to cater to the common perception of businessmen as just one step above the level of criminal thugs. And lastly  but to me most importantly  the nice and neat, good guys win, tie- everything-up-with-a-bow ending is a disservice to the rich darkness of what has gone before, and seems to be a concession to the movie-going public's demand for happy endings. The movie deserved a more complex and ambiguous close. Having said all this, there is some fine acting here from the leads, and the movie does a great job of portraying the frenetic, driven, pace of life in a cutthroat law firm.",Michael Clayton
104,fwomp,George Clooney: More Than Just A Pretty Face,8,24 April 2008,"If there was ever any doubt that George Clooney (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) is more than just a pretty face, MICHAEL CLAYTON should put them to rest. Although women across the world will probably still drool at his magnetism here in this film, he pulls this engrossing movie along and carries most  if not all  of its weight.The story surrounds a pair of attorneys, Michael Clayton (Clooney) and Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) who are employed as ""janitors"" at a powerhouse law firm. The ""janitor lawyers"" clean up messes left by their clients. But when Arthur (Wilkinson) appears to have a mental break during a multimillion dollar negotiations with a pesticide company (shades of THE FUTURE OF FOOD documentary and the Monsanto Corporation are easily seen), Michael is sent in to try and clean up the debacle. But big business, along with Arthur and Michael's firm, are concerned and have clean-up ideas of their own. Hit men, the burning of document warehouses, and even exploding cars are not beyond the realm of dangers facing Mr. Clayton.Definitely in the vein of ERIN BROKOVICH, but this film's focus is not on the ones represented by the attorney's firm and, instead, on the attorneys themselves. Morality and money are the two at-odds items, which is also nothing new to film. But what holds Michael Clayton together is the powerful performances by Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton (THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA), and, of course, Mr. Clooney. Wilkinson's disastrous decent into seeming madness holds a kernel of sympathy and understanding for the viewer. His life, decade upon decade, has been devoted to making and saving money for his firm, but at what moral cost? Coming to the end of his career, the weight of his decisions are heavy upon him and we can feel his dire wish to find a smidgin of good in his final days (""I am Shiva, the god of death."") Tilda Swinton plays Karen Crowder, the firm's new lead attorney for the case abandoned by Arthur (Wilkinson). Her need to win the case overpowers commonsense and even legalities and, in the end, gets the better of her.And then there's Michael Clayton (Clooney) who sees much of himself in Arthur, wondering if this is what awaits him at the end of his career. But there's also Michael's personal life that infringes upon the entire story loop. His son Henry (Austin Williams, THE GOOD SHEPHERD) wants desperately to connect with his father but both have trouble finding common ground; Michael because of his forced amount of time on the job, and Henry because of a fantasy life (see role playing game) that he wants to include his father in. Michael's old gambling habit has also reemerged causing him many a financial woe and forcing another morality play that bites him in the bum when asking for an advance from his boss.The downsides to the film are that it's pretty standard Hollywood fodder as far as movies go, and the ending was a bit too tidy and convenient. I never understood how Michael knew where to find Karen Crowder and when she'd be having a meeting with ""the big client"".Even so, this is a good character story with enough good dialogue and great acting to keep most watchers entertained. And if you're a Clooney fan, you can drool a bit more.",Michael Clayton
105,jon.h.ochiai,Finding Greatness,10,15 October 2007,"In the dramatic story arc George Clooney as attorney Michael Clayton goes down the throat of Senior In-House Counsel Karen Crowder (played by Tilda Swinton), ""Do I look like I'm negotiating!"" Clooney is powerful and riveting in Director and Writer Tony Gilroy's ""Michael Clayton"". Marking Gilroy's directorial debut, this may well be the best movie of the year. Gilroy was the screenwriter of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". Here he demonstrates his compelling, taut, and engrossing storytelling. This is George Clooney's best performance, worthy of an Oscar. I am a fan. Clooney can do breezy better than anyone; consider the ""Ocean's"" movies. But I remember the noble chord he struck in ""Three Kings"". In ""Michael Clayton"" Clooney is stark, vulnerable, and unplugged. The great looking actor is sans the screen charm, playing Michael Clayton as a broken man discovering his own power, and reclaiming his own greatness. Clooney makes it look so easy. Amidst the corporate power plays, the most touching scene is Michael's heart-to-heart with his son Henry (good Austin Williams). He tells Henry that he sees in him-- a great man. Clooney is completely enrolling as Michael, a man who cleans up other's people's messes, while his own life is a shamble. He also embodies in Michael our innate nobility and humanity. ""Michael Clayton"" is about character and redemption. It is a great movie.George Clooney plays Michael Clayton, who is an attorney for Kenner, Bach & Ledeen, one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in New York. Michael, a former city prosecutor, is no longer a practicing litigator. He is the firm's master ""fixer"". He cleans up the messes behind the scenes. Michael is a divorced father. He is a recovering gambler. He is also recovering from a failed restaurant venture with his derelict brother Timmy (brilliantly spineless David Landsbury), which leaves Michael $80,000 in debt. Michael's life soon gets more complicated.Kenner, Bach & Ledeen has been litigating a 6 year, $3 billion class-action lawsuit for their client U/ North, a multi-billion dollar agrochemical company. A U/ North manufactured product apparently killed many farmers and their families. Senior Litigating Partner Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has a critical meltdown, stripping naked and chasing plaintiffs during deposition. U/ North's new Senior Counsel Karen Crowder (brilliant but brittle Tilda Swinton) demands Michael ""handle"" the situation. Crowder's future depends upon a clean resolution for U/ North. She will do anything to achieve this end. Michael soon realizes that Arthur's meltdown is more than his failure to take his depression medication: It is an attack of conscience. Michael pleads with Arthur, ""I'm not the enemy."" Arthur then questions, ""Then who are you?"" Michael must resolve this himself. Michael confronts founding partner Marty Bach (excellent Sydney Pollack), that Arthur may have uncovered the truth and that they may be on the ""wrong side"". Bach enlightens, ""Do you think I didn't know that?"" Tony Gilroy brilliantly sequences his story for narrative impact. ""Michael Clayton"" is classic and compelling tragedy. Gilroy illustrates the decline of decent people when the ends justify the means, and the emergence of heroes in the realm of calculated treachery. To that end Tilda Swinton is amazing. Her Karen is a Lady MacBeth, so steeped in blood she can never return. Swinton is brilliant as a woman making horrific choices with her eyes wide open. Her performance is stunning. Tom Wilkinson is awesome as Arthur, who is on the edge of madness. We have such compassion for Wilkinson, whose character implodes from the horror of his actions. Wilkinson's performance is Oscar caliber. Ultimately, ""Michael Clayton"" shines because of George Clooney. In the lead role his performance is compelling, enrolling, and powerful. His performance is so varied and natural. Clooney captures the nobility and hidden courage of Michael. He and Tony Gilroy inspire in ""Michael Clayton"" which tells the story of reclaiming our own greatness.",Michael Clayton
106,TOMASBBloodhound,Love it.,10,22 September 2010,"I guess its the writing that makes this film such a winner more than anything else. You can tell this film was made by a man who paid his dues as a screenwriter. You can tell by the conversations. None of them are wasted. Every time two characters say something to each other, it means something. Every time someone opens their mouth, we learn more about what kind of person they are. That is great writing. There aren't many random shots wasted on artistic whimsy. The story sucks you in and makes you want more of it. The fact that the acting is superb helps, too. Michael Clayton on the surface may appear as a George Clooney vehicle, but he originally passed on the role. Its a good thing he reconsidered, since his performance is typically excellent. Clooney plays the title character who is a ""fixer"" for a powerful law firm. A ""janitor"" is another term used to describe him. His duties are wide ranging and apparently very important. So much so, he can go to his boss and ask for an $80,0000 bonus to pay off his debts and get it. He basically ties up loose ends and serves as a go-between in sticky situations. There is nothing he can't seem to handle. Things get a bit dicey however when a senior litigator (Tom Wilkinson) has a nervous breakdown that jeopardizes a huge case where the firm is representing a chemical company accused of poisoning small farmers. Tilda Swinton plays this company's top attorney who is not going to wait for Michael Clayton to reign this litigator in. She is an aggressive corporate type who plans on using the company's darkest resources to ""deal"" with Wilkinson. She and Clayton are both working this deranged man from different angles and its just a matter of who will get to him first. The film is not told completely in linear progression, but it won't be a problem for an intelligent viewer. You do have to bring your attention span with you to watch this film.Clooney is in fact very good here. Swinton, when surrounded by other characters, is her typically icy self. Yet when she is alone, you see a nervous vulnerability that is living underneath her facade. It is a dynamic role, and she is more than up to the task. Tom Wilkinson is fascinating as the litigator that loses his mind. His performance is like a concentrated madness, and his opening monologue alone is better than most other films as a whole. We are going to miss Sydney Pollack. Both in front of and behind the camera. He always seemed like such a natural. You totally buy him as the senior partner of Clayton's law firm. And look closely for Robert Prescott who played Kent in Real Genius! He has a decidedly different kind of role here. If you are in the mood for a taut legal thriller, then look no further. 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Michael Clayton

It chronicles the attempts of attorney Michael Clayton (George Clooney) to cope with a colleague's (Tom Wilkinson) apparent mental breakdown and the corruption and murderous intrigue of a major client of his law firm being sued in a class action case involving toxic agrochemicals.The film is an intelligent, literate thriller, blessed with a near-faultless script and boasting superb performances down to the minor roles.

109,Rogue-32,Screen writing at its absolute finest,10,17 October 2007,"There have been many other films which follow a similar storyline to Michael Clayton, but as I've always said, it's not the story per se but rather HOW the story is told that marks the difference between a good film and an exceptional one. Tony Gilroy, the writer of all three Bourne scripts along with many other excellent screenplays, takes on the role of director here as well, and he has created an elegant, flawless, magnificently intelligent masterpiece with Michael Clayton.This is, quite simply, the movie that all those other corporate malfeasance/litigation/damage control/justice-in-the-end films wished they could have been. Gilmore creates a superbly conceived storyline and impeccably executes it by removing all the cliché'ed underpinnings, all the overwrought plot twists, the ham-fisted theatrics, any shred of contrivance, all the clumsy over-stated garbage that weighs down most forays into the genre, giving us instead nothing but quality. Every single minute of the film counts, and this engages you, the viewer, on an extremely concentrated level, where you instinctively realize that each word and action definitely means something. This is a character-driven piece above all, and these characters are brilliantly written. Gilroy provides just the right amount of spot-on detail for each, allowing us to intuit far more about them for ourselves, on our own, while we're watching. The standout for me was Tom Wilkinson's Arthur Edens; no character in recent movie history manages to convey that fine line between genius and madness with more clarity and depth than the always-great Wilkinson does here. Clooney of course is perfect as the title character, giving us a complex study of a hugely conflicted, all-too-human individual who's at a serious crossroads in his life, where he needs to start making grave choices if he's going to survive. His plight is conveyed with superb subtlety, and when the final showdown comes, the payoff is powerful and deeply satisfying. I applauded.",Michael Clayton
110,Danusha_Goska,"Beautifully Made, Very Well Performed, Scary Thriller",8,6 July 2008,"""Michael Clayton"" is a visually beautiful, well performed, genuinely scary thriller. Tom Wilkinson's performance as a bipolar corporate lawyer going off his meds and having a nervous breakdown is stingingly accurate and tear-jerkingly poignant. George Clooney, as a corporate law firm's fixer who is losing his mojo, gives the best performance of his career. A scene in a taxicab that consists of nothing but several minutes of changing expressions on Clooney's face is one of the best performed, most poignant scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time. Tilda Swinton is an ice queen who summons an assassin with no more drama than a woman arranging for home pest extermination. Sydney Pollack contributes his charisma and command.The plot is your basic anti-corporate paranoid nightmare. Rich white men (and one woman) do very bad things to defenseless innocents. Men who have sold their soul at high profit must confront themselves, their moment of truth, and/or death.Director Tony Gilroy wanted to make a movie that was ""beautiful but not pretty."" He was successful. He uses many anamorphic shots and framing in which Clooney is surrounded by negative space. Scenes occur at dawn, dusk, and night. Sets are bluish gray, beige, and black. James Newton Howard's score conveys the invisible trap the characters are struggling against. Given the somber tones, desperate characters, and atmosphere of hopelessness and menace, ""Michael Clayton"" reminded me of film noir.The movie moves slowly at first, and is more opaque than it needs to be. As it picks up speed and becomes easier to follow, it improves.",Michael Clayton
111,jpschapira,"""Washas"" in Hollywood",7,2 February 2008,"Let's call it the ""washa"". There's a problem (this is the ""washa""). We don't know the foundations of the washa, we don't know the exact amount of people involved in the washa, we don't know the importance of the washa; but we do know one thing: Michael Clayton has to fix the ""washa"", and ""Michael Clayton"" is the man's travesty to do it.That we don't know the exact characteristics of the ""washa"" is, I think, one of the film's qualities. For more than one hour, the viewer is still trying to figure out what's going on, putting the pieces of writer/director Tony Gilroy's labyrinthine screenplay together. Meanwhile, George Clooney does what he knows best, and it's not being a great actor but being 'that' guy. Here, that guy is Michael Clayton.When the ""washa"" begins growing, Clayton has to go across the country to look for Arthur (a solid Tom Wilkinson), the lawyer in charge of the case against U-North, an (basically) ecological company (I prefer not to detail much). ""Who is this guy they sent from New York?"", Karen Crowder (a solid, just solid Tilda Swinton) from U-North asks because she's never heard of him. Clayton works for a law firm, but he has everyone fooled: ""You've got the lawyers thinking you're a cop and the cops thinking you're a lawyer"", his brother tells him at one point.Tony Gilroy has written many screenplays and now assumes the challenge of directing, and I must admit it's all very convenient but it doesn't convince me. His difficult script makes the viewer think but it also gets him tired. ""Michael Clayton"" is a slow film and a clever one with one look. But confusing is not always clever, and when Gilroy spends virtually the whole film being anti-Hollywood in his direction, he breaks in the end.In the end, ""Michael Clayton"" is a movie with a lot of Hollywood in it. That's why Hollywood loved it and nominated it for seven Academy Awards. It won't win them all though. Hopefully, the Academy will make justice to James Newton Howard's powerful score; they nominated it and skipped Robert Elswitt's cinematography, which is the best thing of the film (if he achieved wonders here, I can't imagine what ""There Will Be Blood"" looks like).Imagine how convenient the movie must be that Clooney was a producer, as well as Steven Soderbergh and (write it down) Anthony Minghella and director Sidney Pollack, who also works in it. If anything, ""Michael Clayton"" is not a bad cinematographic piece but a big, big disappointment. I respect the Oscars (when I probably shouldn't) and-I've said this-I go running to see every picture that has anything to do with them.I can come up with a better legal thriller than this one in a second, and it's quite recent: Roger Michell's ""Changing Lanes"".

112,gelman@attglobal.net,Not Believable -- but Neither Was Hitchcock,9,27 April 2008,"Much in this film defies belief but it is well-made and suspenseful from start to finish. George Clooney has long reminded me of Cary Grant and this film reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock at his peak. All the improbabilities aside, it is beautifully acted by Clooney, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson and Sidney Pollack and the suspense is sustained throughout at a very high level. You need to let the movie carry you along because if you examine the premise and the details too closely, the critic in you takes over and the plot just doesn't hold together. Forget logic. It never played a big part in most Hitchcock films. It doesn't play much of a part in this film either. But at the level of pure entertainment it seems better to me than any of the other Academy Award best picture nominees. (Not that I would have given it the prize.

Clooney tones down the charm to a minimum as the fixer attorney whose gambling vice never quites gets bad enough to stop him being a decent-if-not-great Dad. Sydney Pollack is a nuanced boss, hard, driven, but loyal. Tilda Swinton manages to make a mastermind antagonist appear more nerve-wracked than cunning. Her moral decisions are shown to be every bit as weighty and life-changing as the protagonist's. The film takes risks and they pay off. Tom Wilkinson as a lawyer who finds insight in madness could have been vaudeville if pitched incorrectly. Clooney stopping to commune with the horses at daybreak might just appear twee in the hands of a less capable director. As it is, these moments are stunning and uplifting in turn.

115,vostf,"The screenwriter-director trap: tedious pace, from first reel",4,24 January 2011,"Most screenwriters don't have what it takes to shoot a story with the appropriate rhythm. The problem is they like words, words feel nice on paper and they end up over-burdening the director since words don't necessarily translate well in terms of visual and space narratives.Michael Clayton and Duplicity were two movies with a very interesting premise, a promising cast, and a very unimpressive result. So I guess it has something to do with Tony Gilroy. From the very first scenes I felt something important was ill-executed in Michael Clayton. First there's this very annoying, forced, voice-over which really gets us to a very bad start. It reminded me of the introductory v-o narration in the documentary Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, except there the rhythm picked up and in the end it was a great thriller of a documentary. Then you have some low-key exposition - something screenwriters are deeply proud of, and they sometimes are trying too hard to be subtle, esp. as screenwriter-directors, taking all their time to be subtle. The poker scene should have been a key feature in the exposition, but it feels like a totally irrelevant scene. You don't feel how much Michael Clayton (George Clooney) was/is addicted to gambling, you only get clues that he used to gamble at some other, nicer, place, that he's done bad business as owner of a bar. Low-key, subtle touches but visually it's dumb, uninteresting, uneventful, which is correlated with the fact it wastes time, not advancing efficiently key plot elements.First-reel contact is really bad, and there are no signs it's just a matter of bad introductory choices. Instead, as in 99% of such ill-conceived movies, it's a matter of initial poor choices that will linger on the rest of the movie. The story of Michael Clayton is mostly one big 4-day flashback with a prologue and an epilogue. The prologue is slow, devoid of ""plot peaks"" that could titillate our interest -- forget about building suspense. Low-skills directors mistake suspense for heavy atmosphere, slow narration, and we get more of the latter in the flashback.Disjointed narrative, no sense of immediacy or urgency, no time or space or psychological pressure, the hero is just bullied around in the story. Think of the difference between a tense atmosphere and a character that just moves around somewhat ill-at-ease for nothing seems right in his life. That is the technical assessment of this movie. Now the conclusion is fast, at last, but nothing was right in making us crave for it. it's just edited in at the end, like an clean and sharp attachment to a long and tedious email.Now you can't blame the technical crew, they did a great job but you really have to think of it when you're watching a boring movie. There's a good cast too for sure, but I was not impressed by George Clooney since his character was so little interesting. Now he was involved in the production and he must have thought this was a deep likable torn-apart character, so he is largely to blame here for the decisions made upfront. At the end of the day the premise was interesting but most conspiracy movies from the 70s are more interesting, faster than this.",Michael Clayton
116,RJBurke1942,"where Michael Clayton learns all about corpus delicti, and then some",6,15 May 2008,"Most everybody loves a movie that sets out to bash corporations for their commercial and legal duplicities that result in harm to people and the environment; and especially these days, what with all the rising food costs, oil costs, global warming, climate change, you name it. So, a film such as this didn't have to be all that good to make an impact. A good cast helps, naturally, and with George Clooney as the big draw, well, I guess it just had to make people sit up and take notice. I'm not bagging the film unduly  it's quite good, as thrillers go  but there have been, I think, better ones before, viz. Silkwood (1983), A Civil Action (1998) and, of course, Erin Brockavich (2000).What sets this one apart is the fact that it's really all about Michael Clayton (George Clooney), which explains the title (note the similarity there to Silkwood and Brockavich). What sets this one even further apart from the others is that Michael is a bad guy as we begin the story: Michael's a fixer, and a dirty one, for a greedy (are there any that are not?) law firm on the brink of financial disaster when their chief trial lawyer, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson)  (and you'll just love the symbolism of that surname as the story progresses)  who's just gone nuts  because he's seen the error of his ways - and who is now jeopardizing the outcome of a three billion dollar case against some uppity, upstate farmers who just won't go away with their complaints about the agricultural products from U-North, the corporate villain.Now, you don't know all of that in the first twenty minutes. But, what you do know is that somebody tries to kill Michael in that time  his car is blown to bits while he's walking up a hill towards some horses  and that action guarantees that most will hang around to see the rest of the story. Well, I decided to see the rest of it, anyway. So then, the whole story is recounted in flashback, beginning Four Days Earlier. I don't particularly like narratives that structure a story in that manner; but, that's a personal thing, notwithstanding the fact that I very much liked Citizen Kane (1941), among others, which, as you know, is told almost entirely in flashback. I think, however, that Michael Clayton was deliberately structured so that the big bang occurred quite early in the film as The Hook.For me, the hook was something else: why on earth did he walk up that damn hill to commune with a trio of horses, considering where he'd just come from? It seemed too much of a very convenient ploy to get him out of his car and away from the bomb that he didn't know about. Only much later does all that make sense...However, moving on: The bomb isn't the only thing that troubles Michael. We find out that he should be a member of Gamblers Anonymous, if there is such an organization, because he's lost so much money at it; call Michael The Man with the Leaden Arm, on that score. And, to make matters worse, he's lost a bundle at a restaurant he opened and is trying to sell it for whatever he can get. In short, he's not just in a hole  he's in an abyss. And, oh, yeah: his marriage failed, but he has very bright young son, Henry (Austin Williams), who, in my opinion, just happens to be the best actor in the whole movie. So, Michael is a bit of a mess and still going down...But, those corporate shenanigans  lead by the evil and very twisted Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton)  leer up to involve Michael in attempts to bring Arthur, the nutty lawyer, back into the fold. In doing so, however, Michael begins to uncover nasty aspects about the firm he works for, and that three billion dollar gorilla looming. And, when his friend Arthur apparently suicides, Michael  to put it mildly  begins to smell T-Rat and starts to dig further. As he does so, he gets closer to the smell that surrounds U-North and Karen Crowder. Hence, when it comes, the denouement between the two is tightly drawn, sucking us in to expect what we think is coming and then springing the nicely done surprise. Swinton received a well-deserved Oscar in her supporting role.It's a well produced and directed film, and the editing is up to par. The main characters are well supported by Sidney Pollack as Marty Bach, the CEO of the law firm; Pollack seems to love playing corporate bad guys, he turns up so often - shades of Eyes Wide Shut (1999) and all that.The ending is much discussed and apparently maligned by many. And, there are many opinions about what it all means. I'll say this: simply compare what Michael had been doing for twenty years or so and think about exactly what he's doing as that long take scene fades to black and the credits roll. Not too difficult to figure, I reckon.Recommended for all.",Michael Clayton
117,Blue-Grotto,Coolness under Pressure,8,3 September 2017,"Law and justice are common misconceptions. For truth is adjustable. It depends on money and influence. Michael Clayton is short on both. Deep in debt, isolated and with his authority as special counsel at a massive law firm becoming increasingly tenuous, Michael has no room error. Then the trouble really begins. Arthur, a leading attorney for the firm, suffers a breakdown. Michael is marked for execution. With billions of dollars and lives hanging in the balance, Michael realizes he must channel the skills he learned as a powerful trial attorney; coolness under pressure, finding and exploiting thresholds for pain, and adjusting the truth.Attorneys, especially those at gigantic firms like Michael's, must jettison or channel their emotions to win. Even then, winning often does not mean success. Arthur is broken down from years of screaming, stalling, scheming and sacrificing his well-being – and that of those he loves - in exchange for billable hours. Eyes opening to the beauty of life and love, Arthur resists Michael's efforts to bring him back to the tasks of the firm. To help Arthur, the firm and all those who depend upon them, Michael first must help himself. The film reveals why, as a law school graduate, I am not practicing law.As a thriller, Michael Clayton is first rate. Tensions are heightened as puzzle pieces of the story and the motivations of the fascinating characters are gradually revealed and the film jumps back in time. Those in the audience who pay attention to little details are rewarded. The reason for a malfunctioning vehicle GPS unit, for instance, is revealed near the end of the film and with much impact. George Clooney (Michael), Tom Wilkinson (Arthur) and Tilda Swinton are amazing. With added depth to the dialogue, soundtrack and cinematography, the film could be more compelling, yet viewers will delight, as I did, in the charms of this pulse quickening film. Ten years since the release of the film and the nation receives a daily schooling, from the highest levels of government, in the relevance of its theme of adjustable truth.",Michael Clayton
118,DonFishies,"Good, but not Oscar good",7,4 February 2008,"Michael Clayton eluded me when it was first released. It looked great, but did not have that immediacy that warranted a viewing right there and then. But as awards season pressed on, it seemed like the film would turn out to be the perennial bridesmaid (and occasional winner) to the likes of No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood. And after checking it out, I do not understand why.The titular character (played by George Clooney), is dubbed a fixer by his law firm for his ability to fix sticky situations. A friend, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) is working on a rather high profile case for years, but ends up going a little squirrelly during a litigation meeting. As Clayton sets out to fix it, he becomes entangled in something so much more complex than he ever thought.After watching Michael Clayton, it becomes apparent why the film did not seem so immediate. It revolves around a fictional agriculture group called U-North, and I am sure that should set off bells as to where the plot could possibly be going. They reveal a lot of this in the trailer, and then when you watch the film, and there are no real surprises that happen. Even if I never watched, I could practically predict a lot of the events that happened, and most of the turns the film took. It never seems to want to have tried to surprise the audience at all (although there are quite a bit of murky moments that end up just making the film confusing as opposed to surprising). Instead, it plays a lot of itself out in the mentality of ""seen it, done it"", and seems to owe a lot more to the films that it would like to. It brings nothing new to the table of contemporary legal thrillers. While I cannot picture the perfect legal film, this is not it.But the thing is, the movie is not all that bad. Yes, it is plagued by some really boring areas, and some really inane subplots involving Clayton himself, but a lot of it works. There is a rather interesting plot at work here, and even though it gets rather predictable, it does intrigue. It did keep me watching throughout the proceedings, even if I was not all that riveted. First-time writer Tony Gilroy has composed an interesting film in Michael Clayton, but it really does not seem like he knew what he wanted to achieve with it in the long run. It feels like a short term gamble, than it does an important and worthy competitor for Best Picture at the Oscars.What really bothered me was that it calls itself a thriller, but the riveting moments are not all that thrilling. One particular moment plays out twice in the film. But when we see it the second time, it is played out as being really thrilling, and suggesting that the audience does not know what is coming. Except, we already know the outcome, and it plays out the exact same way, albeit with explanations for its occurrence. So why is Gilroy attempting to pump up the adrenaline, and suggest we will see something different? Scenes like this speak to the amateur nature of the first-time director, but he is also a veteran screenwriter. So why does it seem like he is tinkering with his script, and making it less of the thriller it should be? Even with its scripting problems, Clooney is great as Clayton. His always reliable nature continues to bring a great presence to his roles, and he continues to build up his resume with a balanced amount of fun films and serious ones as well. While his work here is not as great as it was in Syriana, it is still equally as measurable. Even when the film is simply trying to be thrilling, Clooney lights up the screen and chews up the scenery. He does wonders in the film, and works great even in the useless character building scenes. We understand Clayton's motivations because Clooney conveys them excellently during the needed scenes, we did not need the fleshing out of his family background. It may work as simple filler, but Clooney makes it watchable, and not sleep inducing.The supporting cast, while not featured on screen nearly as much as Clooney, does fairly well for itself. I really liked Sydney Pollack as one of the higher-ups in the law firm, and Austin Williams as Clayton's son Henry.Tilda Swinton, playing one of the leaders at U-North, is a bit of an interesting case. We see a lot of her character in montaged speech clips, dressing up for the speech playing alongside clips of her delivering it. It does great for her character development, but when she actually gets to moving around and doing things, she seems more clichéd that anything else. I was expecting a lot from her, especially with the Oscar nomination, and while she gave a good performance, it just did not seem to be good enough.Tom Wilkinson on the other hand, shines brightly throughout his moments on screen. His muted and crazy performance is one of the highlights of the film, even if he is surprisingly missing from a lot of it. He plays brilliantly off of Clooney, and gives the desperation of the character the great look that it needs. The development of his character is a little stunted and grouped in with the revelations of ""what he knows"", but it ends up coming off as more useful than the family moments with Clayton.Michael Clayton is a good movie, but is not the award worthy movie it is being made out to be. Clooney is great though, and Wilkinson is excellent in his role. It does work as a good first try from Gilroy, but it could have used a lot of work.7/10.",Michael Clayton

That intrigued me, and after a wait for nearly 4-5 weeks of its running in the theatres, I went to see it.The story is about an attorney Michael Clayton (George Clooney) who plays a dark character of a difficult case solver for big firms; one of the case given to him by the Senior Director Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) is of the whimsical Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) who is feared to expose the company's corrupt secret. By the time Karen eliminates Arthur, she faces the decision to eliminate Michael too  as he is getting deeper into the secrets.I will not tell you the whole story. The first time writer turned debutant director Tony Gilory maintains the suspense and the tempo until the very end, except a couple of scenes in the first half  especially the ones with Arthur and Michael's son.George Clooney, who is also the executive producer of the movie has acted brilliantly and plays the dark character efficiently to its core. The transformation of Michael to go against the corporation is shown with good screenplay. Tom Wilkinson is also very good in his small but key role. He forms the moral core of the movie. Tilda Swinton, despite her heavily botox face  has acted extremely well.The last one shot scene  when the end titles start rolling has been acted perfectly by George, where he wins the hearts of the audiences with his graceful  stern to stress to winning expression.All in all a good thriller drama  one should not miss.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",Michael Clayton

Tilda Swinton is truly inspired in her performance and offers a superb depiction of Karen Crowder, the legal counsel for U-North, a bitch with many regrets; her dressing, body language, hairdo, even her fake fatty parts are so well placed and incorporated into the character, that she becomes her character.

This stylish examination of Michael Clayton is at once traditional and cutting edge--traditional in that, like some of the Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper films of the late 1930's, it pits a man against the system, shows a man who battles with his conscience to discover what is right.But the film is modern and exciting and expects input from the audience, expects the audience to pay attention to the subtleties of shifting moods and atmospheres; even in the final scene, Clooney and director Gilroy allow the viewer some thinking time, and the performances are consistently compelling--even to the child.

124,WriterDave,Stylish Legal Thriller Ends in Hung Jury,7,16 October 2007,"So there's this giant corporation that creates some super-pesticide (or something) that gets into the ground water of some rural upper Midwestern farmers, and low and behold, leads to all kinds of hellish cancer (exactly what the in-house scientists warned of) that then--Surprise!-- turns into a three billion dollar class action lawsuit. Six years into the seemingly endless proceedings, the lead attorney defending the evil corporation (Tom Wilkinson, channeling Peter Finch from ""Network"") turns into a raving morally conflicted lunatic. In steps the firm's ""fixer"" (George Clooney, somber and serious), the film's title character, to make sense of things and perform damage control. Meanwhile, the corporation's in-house counsel (Tilda Swinton, perfect as an unethical lawyer in way over her head) scrambles towards a fiscally feasible settlement before the truth is leaked.Despite the convoluted legal mumbo-jumbo, ""Michael Clayton"" is entertaining enough, as much of it results in some well executed scenes of wire-tapping and murder. In his directorial debut, screenwriter Tony Gilroy successfully plays with some stylistic elements. Most of this occurs in the film's editing as time-frames and POV's are occasionally jumbled, and dialogue frequently overlaps onto scene transitions. It keeps the viewers on their heels even when what's going is rather dry and boring. The early scenes with Swinton's character are especially well done, as is the elliptical focus on a car bombing.The performances are all top-notch, with the normally smug Clooney nailing the lead role with just the right amount of nonchalant star power. Unfortunately, the attempts at character development are superficial and stretch credibility. If Clayton is such a legal genius and so good at fixing problems, why does he have gambling issues and get sucked into bad business deals with his clichéd shifty brother? Clayton is also given an obnoxiously precocious son who plays into some of the film's more literary motifs, an ailing father, and a noble cop brother (yes, another brother) who factors too conveniently into the film's conclusion. None of these elements or unnecessary characters explain why Clayton is the way he is, or for that matter, who he really is.""Michael Clayton"" comes to a modestly satisfying conclusion, though the internal conflict of Clayton isn't as compelling as Gilroy so valiantly wants it to be. Thanks to some stylish attempts to invigorate what is traditionally a low energy genre and some excellent performances, the film scores slightly higher than a top-line John Grisham adaptation, but still amounts to nothing extraordinary.",Michael Clayton

126,the-movie-guy,"As with any corporate conspiracy, the secret will come out and so will this movie",8,10 October 2007,"(My Synopsis) Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a former criminal prosecutor who left public service for the big bucks by joining the prestigious law firm of Kenner, Bach and Ledeen's, one of the largest law firms in New York City. Michael becomes an in-house fixer, or janitor, who works behind the scenes cleaning up all the messes that the clients of the law firm make. Michael has been given the title of the miracle man when it comes to making problems go away. Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) sends Michael to Minneapolis to rescue and solve a very big problem when Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has a mental breakdown. Arthur has been defending U/North Agrochemical against a $3 billion class-action lawsuit for the last 6 years and this breakdown might hurt their case. Michael must smooth things over with Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), chief counsel for U/North. Unfortunately for Michael, Karen doesn't think he can fix this problem, so she takes things into her own hands. Michael begins to have a reality-check; he begins to see that he can not solve his own problems when it comes to his family, his failed restaurant, or his gambling addiction and now even his work.(My Comment) This is one of those good stories about a corporate conspiracy to keep the truth from coming out. As with any secret, if two or more people know about it, it is not a secret for long. The opening scene shows Michael's car blowing up in the country, then the film takes us back 4 days to show us the events that led up to the attempt on Michael's life. As the days pass, Michael is disturbed by what is happening in his life. George Clooney's performance as Michael is superb. Tilda Swinton plays the part of the unethical and stressed out evil lawyer, and nails it to a T. The story itself builds slowly and works together into an intricate plot. If you like suspense, stories of ethical conflict, corporate greed, or you just like George Clooney, you will like this movie. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run time 1:59, Rated R)(8/10)",Michael Clayton

I sold out Arthur for 80 grand. I'm your easiest problem and you try to kill me? Finally, a thriller that's not lacking in intelligent plot! First time filmmaker Tony Gilroy brings us a suspenseful, engaging and intricate legal drama about a plot to expose a corrupt weed killer company whose product is hazardous to those who buy it. George Clooney, in his finest performance to date, plays Michael Clayton, a high-level lawyer at a big firm in NYC, who works as a ""fixer"". Basically his job entails keeping clients out of legal trouble by lying, cheating and doing all sorts of other dirty work. When one of the firm's big shot corporate lawyers, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), goes off his meds and starts exposing a weed killer company's dirty secrets he works for, it's up to Clayton to diffuse the situation. That's about all I'll tell you about the story, in fear I might give something away.As far as thrillers go, 'Michael Clayton' is certainly one of the better ones. The acting is all top notch, with a brilliant performance by George Clooney. Tom Wilkinson couldn't be better as the lawyer who has a mental breakdown, and Tilda Swinton is absolutely incredible as Karen Crowder, the ""evil"" weed killer company's litigator. Sydney Pollack and Michael O'Keefe are also solid, but the real star is writer/director Tony Gilroy. From his near-flawless screenplay to his cool, slick film-making style, Gilroy has succeeded in making one hell of a debut film.My only complaint with Michael Clayton is that it takes a while to build suspense. The first 30 minutes are a bit shaky, but after it builds some momentum, 'Michael Clayton' becomes a force to be reckoned with. Expect some possible Oscar nods for original screenplay, George Clooney and Tilda Swinton. Grade: B+",Michael Clayton

He's someone that the lawyers can depend on if the clients aren't happy or somebody has a dirty secret that needs to be wiped away fast.

George Clooney has never failed as an actor when he's doing comedy or being serious and he does an excellent job as Michael Clayton. Tom Wilkinson's performance has been compared to Peter Finch's Howard Beale from the movie ""Network"" in which they're both mad as hell and not going to take it anymore, and yet, Wilkinson steals the spotlight in his finest American film role. Tilda Swinton, who took home the best supporting actress award for her role as the villain, has never had her hands clean or dirty in the film if you get my drift.

Sometimes this gets very tiring but sometimes they make a movie that's like a lot of others and still manage to make it entertaining. That's what I can say about Michael Clayton. All of this has been seen before from 'The Verdict' to 'The Firm' to the 'Pelican Brief'. Those movies had something this movie didn't- a really sympathetic character or characters in the case of the Brief. This movie only had one really sympathetic character- Arthur. And he's only sympathetic if you decide that his madness is really not madness but an epiphany of conscience. Maybe one other character is worthy of our sympathy that is Henry, Michael Clayton's son. But unfortunately Michael is not a very sympathetic character because we aren't given enough information about how he came to be what he is. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie mostly because I love lawyer fare. It's well done, suspenseful and satisfying in the end. But I don't think this is a Oscar worthy performance by George Clooney; Tom Wilkinson is more deserving and Tilda Swinton is her usually, bizarre, interesting character. 8/10",Michael Clayton

Fortunately Micheal Clayton was one of the ...(read more)most well written and performed films I've seen in a long time. Tom Wilkinson turns in the performance of his career, which evokes ""Network"", but with as much wide eyed innocence as apocalyptic despair. The opening monologue seizes your attention and by the end of the movie, I was re-winding to hear it again. What makes this movie so effective is that it's more of a character study than a traditional crime/law procedural film, it's not even much a mystery, the subject of the cover up is tragic, but it's not the subject of the film, it just sets things in motion. The film is about roles and role playing, corruption, redemption, and a belief in the miraculous over the fatalistic. The book within the story ""Realms And Conquest"" plays a very, very significant role, and it's interwoven so subtly it's almost easy to miss, but it links several characters together and several of the films grander themes.

131,CinematicInceptions,Good talent put into a boring story.,6,21 June 2018,"I can see that there was a lot of skill that went into crafting this story, but unfortunately I can't say that I enjoyed it. I can tell that this is the sort of story that has been well thought out and probably doesn't have any plot holes, but it was just not something that I could follow. Much like when I watch the original Mission Impossible movie, I can sort of understand what's going on with the plot as I'm watching it, but as soon as I turn it off, I have no clue what happened. Part of me feels as though there should have been a way to make the content of this movie a little more comprehensible, after seeing how expertly Sorkin was able to make good sense of legal dealings in The Social Network. However, because the entire movie of Michael Clayton centers around legal cases instead of just featuring one, I guess it was inevitable that there would be a lot of legal jargon.If this were made today, it would definitely be a tv show, and actually it might not make a bad one. It would have been easier to follow Michael's arc and it wouldn't have been necessary to condense some of the more technical expositiony bits as much. Also, the concept of the movie is just not terribly cinematic, but could have been more interesting if it had more time with its characters. There are still some movies like this that are made, but they are not big and don't even really get the kind of award season recognition that this one did. I don't quite know how to feel about that, maybe it's a good thing, but the fact is that ""adult dramas"" like this are a dying genre.Though it is hard to judge the acting performances because I didn't understand the context of each scene that well, it seemed like everyone gave a pretty good performance here. Tilda Swinton, is good as always, and once again is unrecognizable from her other roles. Tom Wilkinson played one of his more annoying roles, but doesn't do badly in it. George Clooney had a more impressive performance than I'd ever seen out of him. I don't think any aspect of the movie deserved its Oscar nominations, but maybe that was because 2007 was a bit of an off year in terms of awards movies. I wouldn't recommend this that strongly for anyone. I can imagine someone enjoying it, but I don't know who. One feature that might be attractive is that it takes a more realistic look at the work lawyers do than something like Law and Order or even To Kill a Mockingbird. However, it is a very serious movie and isn't likely to have any of the appeal that most people traditionally seek in movies. Overall Rating: 6.4/10",Michael Clayton

Then when the firm's top lawyer, Arthur Edens (Wilkinson), has an epiphany of morality that comes off as complete insanity (for no real reason, other than to kick off the huge conspiracy and give Wilkinson a more juicy part) Clayton has to struggle with his own morality and the task of deciding to bring down the indecent corporation he works for or to stay on and keep bringing in the big paychecks.

I'll eat my hat if this part doesn't get Tom Wilkinson his second nomination for best actor. But then, the part of the madman has been everyone's favorite since the dawn of drama. Thanks to his impeccable box office pedigree as the man behind the ""Bourne"" trilogy, the producers let writer-director Tony Gilroy get away with a far from mainstream script. He takes inspiration from tales of John Doe glory like ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""Payback"" for plot, and from late nineties gems like ""The Game"" and ""A Perfect Murder"" for style and atmosphere, creating a quiet yet suspenseful tale of a weary warrior's tenacity.

If it wasn't, a synopsis of this movie would sound like a first draft screenplay, perhaps some obvious plot points that would later be given a few extra twists. I don't watch many legal films or legal TV dramas. This made watching MC a fresh perspective. The main character is not George Clooney's character, it's the mad associate in the firm who has a billion dollar lawsuit on the line. Tom Wilkinson gives a bravado performance as a man on the edge, and has the most interesting aspect to this plot. The time spent on the other characters work well, and one soon discovers that character exposition is being used to cover the fact that the plot is quite conventional. The production design and music are nearly nonexistent. The cinematography is always just slightly off level, with almost all scenes shot with four walls closing in on the main character. Clooney's character is reserved and has cliché burnout traits; gambling addiction, child support, and a screwed up brother. He is broke but has been a valued member of a huge firm for several years. It was reminding me of Paul Newman in ""The Verdict"". Nevertheless, again with fresh eyes, you hook into the momentum as the movie slowly pieces together the stressful situation.

140,bobbobwhite,Why would anyone want this job?,7,15 October 2007,"I guess it paid well so that was one big reason, but George Clooney as Michael Clayton gave his character the right amount of agony, angst and personal resignation that a crummy job like his would have demanded of anyone. He was a fixer, a janitor, i.e., a NYC big-name law firm lawyer who used to practice law, but now only practices cleaning up the messy problems in his law firm and in its client cases that might negatively affect an ongoing case if not made to go away by this so-called miracle worker. Another motivation for the job.......as a result of being a losing habitual gambler, he needed the money he made doing his dirty job to pay his big debts.I imagine there are jobs like his in the real world, but few could last very long in them if similar things happened to them such as the long hours and severe threats to life and limb shown in this film. If not mental burnout, surely death would cut into their effectiveness greatly before too long.The intelligent story developed slowly as I kept waiting for more physical activity, but it was more of an internal, visceral thriller than an action one,and included lots of adoring sustained shots of George's handsome mug in various facial tics and expressions that first made me think the film might have been meant to be more of a vehicle for salivating George worshipers than a great story about a compromised man in an impossible job. However, it accomplished both tasks pretty well.Tom Wilkenson and Tilda Swinton were terrific as, respectively, a principal at the big law firm who was breaking down mentally, and a sold-out agribiz lawyer stressfully defending her firm's criminal biz practices. But, it was Sydney Pollack, the one-time 60's actor turned director that keeps surprising me...he is a terrific actor in every film I have seen him in(think Tootsie) and was at least the equal of the more heralded stars in this film. He was terrific here as the cool and controlling co-head of the law firm who was always working out impossible problems in order to keep the doors open.This was yet another film that made me think that we probably need more control over big biz and the ways they make money. I gave the film a 7+, and recommend it to viewers who like internal and intelligent thrillers rather than big, loud, fast testosterone-blasting ones that Hollywood usually pushes at us.",Michael Clayton
141,freakfire-1,Slighty worse than Skinwalkers,2,18 June 2008,"I paid attention to this movie and did not think much of it at all. Yes, I got the plot. But, no, I did not think it was brilliantly executed or thought it had a descent plot to begin with. In fact, at the end of the movie I was waiting for a better ending.I understand Clayton gets caught up in a world much more dangerous than his usual cases. Chased by men that want him dead and a man that goes crazy, he tries to figure out a case with a company that produces agricultural products that are unsafe to human. With a couple of mysterious deaths, Clayton (Clooney) gets the upper hand despite losing his car to a bomb.There really wasn't a lot in the film, other than the men chasing Clooney trying to blow him up. Sure there were a couple of deaths, including one tampered with to make it look like it wasn't a murder, but nothing that really caught my eye. Yes, there was a evil corporate entity in the movie. But that has been done before and much better.So, overall I did not enjoy most of the movie. Clooney can talk to all the cows he wants and watch his car explode, but if thats the only thing that was funny and cool at the same time them forget it. I am glad I didn't spend money on this.

As he does so things happen that cause him to question his life and how he sees himself in it. George Clooney is Fantastic as Michael Clayton he deserved his Oscar nod. Tilda Swinton However did deserve her win as she was outstanding in a movie that was already outstanding and in order to do that you must really be good and she is. The story is complex but not overly so.If you watch it and pay attention to it the payoff is one of the best movies you will have seen all year.,Michael Clayton
143,Eternality,"Yes, Michael Clayton promotes brain activity, unfortunately it doesn't have the power to compel.",7,15 May 2011,"Tony Gilroy's debut feature has a mixed reception. It's the kind of film that is good and bad simultaneously, without a hint of being either. Michael Clayton is the first time Gilroy's working directly behind the camera, after years working as a screenplay writer. He is most well- known for his successful role in adapting Robert Ludlum's Bourne series, ensuring that it's just as consistently exhilarating on the big screen as it was in the novel. Michael Clayton is a legal thriller that's more intellectual than visceral. One for the thinking folks, the film starts off unconventionally with a stuttering voice describing the dire situation he's in. It follows through to a key flashback sequence, after which the film skis down a potentially risky slope - for the next ninety minutes, the film is like a locomotive going in a closed loop. We find ourselves back to square one, witnessing a long series of unfortunate events that lead to that above-mentioned flashback sequence. While the script is sound and stimulating, the narrative structure of the screenplay is questionable. What does the movie wish to drive at?George Clooney plays the title role with confidence, alongside great performances by Tom Wilkinson, Sydney Pollack, and Tilda Swinton. We see Clooney in a more vulnerable position than Danny Ocean ever dreamt of offering, his display a fine balance of suaveness and steel. Michael Clayton slackens for most parts, looking like a dull legal warfare procedural with no clear focus, one that is poised for failure. The strong points of the film lie in the cinematography and lighting. The cold, corporate world is portrayed as it is in reality. In addition, James Newton Howard's score is a marked improvement over his shoddy work in the recent sci-fi horror, I Am Legend.Michael Clayton is at times remarkable, at times a blob of mess. The fault lies in the manner the story is framed. Does the film intend to be a character study of ""Michael Clayton""? Or does it wish to criticize and draw parallels with the greedy, dishonest world we live in? Either way, it succeeds. But at a level that is too vague, and definitely confusing to most. Yes, Michael Clayton promotes brain activity, unfortunately it doesn't have the power to compel. An above average motion picture that's neither here nor there. Doesn't deserve to be nominated for Best Picture (Golden Globe). GRADE: C+ (6.5/10 or 3 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",Michael Clayton
144,mgd_m,Super Boring,4,20 April 2019,"And loosely written. I don't know what all the reviews rave about. It's an uninspired thriller that pretends to be original someway, but it's off-target. An attorney who forgets the pills and wants to change side? Come on. Also, everybody in the movie talks about Clooney's character as someone who ""cleans"" and ""fixes problems"", somebody who ""makes miracles"", but he seems a rather crappy problem solver instead. He does nothing to back up that unwarranted reputation. Finally, all the scenes about his personal life and family are unnecessary, apart from a detail or two. Bad script.",Michael Clayton
145,luke-a-mcgowan,Unengrossing and unremarkable,3,27 November 2014,"Michael Clayton is good in theory, but regrettably unremarkable. A story of a New York lawyer who ""fixes"" things, viewers are immediately drawn to a modern day Harvey Keitel from Pulp Fiction. Unfortunately, whilst Clooney as Clayton injects urgency and drama, he really does feel cut out of the loop, far from calm and in control. The character portrayed by Clooney feels like he would be admirable in another film. Tilda Swinton is notably in fine form and Tom Wilkinson gives a very impressive performance as the bipolar Arthur, and his opening monologue is one of the most gripping scenes in the film. Unfortunately, this film - advertised as a legal thriller - is unjustified as a thriller and even less as a legal film. The premise feels undercooked, little exists to interest me in the story, especially compared to great Grisham legal dramas such as A Time to Kill and The Rainmaker. Its some notable work for Clooney, WIlkinson and Swinton and a promising attempt by Gilroy, but Michael Clayton is rather bland, a bit undercooked and ultimately forgettable.",Michael Clayton

Soon I was suddenly pulling out of the dark tunnel and seeing the scenery and understood. OH! OH!

147,galileo3,"A slick, intelligently written legal thriller",8,9 March 2008,"Michael Clayton (2007)Michael Clayton is the kind of film that requires you to concentrate and follow an increasingly apparent corporate scandal involving a chemicals company.The first 50 minutes of the film will be unclear until the last half of the film; this will undoubtedly tire some and definitely bore others. Michael Clayton is not for everyone.George Clooney is Michael Clayton, a 'fixer' for a huge firm and works in New York. We see how everything looks perfect on the surface; his slick, expensive suits, his Mercedes S-Class, his accessories - however beneath all that we see a troubled man, who owns money and results to gambling to pay his debts. He is divorced, seeing his son very rarely.Clooney is supported by a great cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Sydney Pollack and Tilda Swinton, in her Academy Award winning role.Arguably , Michael Clayton presents nothing extraordinary; we know about the misdeeds and relentless greed of corporate America; we know about the moral flexibility required for some lawyers. In many respects this film is only a 7 out of 10. However, the great acting and energy between the cast, the tightly focused directing and screenplay by Tony Gilroy, music by James Newton Howard and even the cinematography by Robert Elswitt, add weight to the whole film.8/10",Michael Clayton
148,higherall7,When the Doves cry and the Ducks fall...,9,11 April 2021,"Watching MICHAEL CLAYTON (2007), I was again reminded of two things. The first is Larry Gross' entertaining and enlightening article titled FILM APRES NOIR. This film seems to be a perverse treatment of the six traits of FILM APRES NOIR that Gross identified in his illuminating and thought-provoking piece. The other is how Tilda Swinton's Oscar Award winning performance as Karen Crowder finally helped me to understand how people come to swear themselves to movements and organizations such as the Nazis. First things first; I'll state how I see this movie as an example of FILM APRES NOIR to my mind, and then elaborate simply on how Swinton's portrayal of Crowder helped me to experience a great truth in a visceral rather than intellectual way.Larry Gross mentioned six elements of FILM APRES NOIR, (or Film After Dark), as I said before. Listed simply these items went something like this: 1) THE HERO OUT OF TIME, 2) THE AESTHETICIZATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, 3) THE ABSURDITY OF VIOLENCE, 4) THE DIMINUTION OF SEXUAL IDENTITY, 5) THE DIMENSIONLESS VILLAIN, 6) THE PROBLEMATIC ENDING. This is how I came finally to understand this film as a total product of the Cinema. At first, I was simply aware that there were those in the story who were attempting to manage and navigate themselves through some kind of moral quagmire. It also became obvious from the beginning that there were also those who were attempting to escape from it.Both George Clooney as Michael Clayton and Tom Wilkinson as Arthur Edens represent THE HERO OUT OF TIME. Michael Clayton has the sanity and intelligence to appreciate the moral ambiguity and corruption of his profession and surroundings, but not the moral will to do anything substantial about it. Arthur Edens has suddenly discovered he has the moral will to do something about it, but this discovery apparently unseats him from his sanity even as he attempts to exercise enough intelligence to right present wrongs. The narrative demonstrates that it will take the two of them to do anything substantial to affect the corruption that is ingrained as a part of their lifestyle. Just as it took John Wayne as Tom Doniphon and Jimmy Stewart as Ransom Stoddard to lift their town out of its corruption enough to evolve an advanced concept of city life and statehood, in the film THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962). Both characters in this movie experience THE AESTHETICIZATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, though not strictly speaking in exactly the terms that Gross expresses or implies. Reviewing the film will show you exactly what I mean. Each also experiences THE ABSURDITY OF VIOLENCE, as its effectiveness proves to be dubious at best when practiced upon them. Each experiences THE DIMINUTION OF SEXUAL IDENTITY; Clayton is managing the fall out from the divorce of his wife and the alloted times he has to spend with his son, and Edens becomes enamored of a young lady to the point of abasing himself before her. Each experiences the sense of confronting THE DIMENSIONLESS VILLAIN. Whatever it is they are fighting against seems to be everywhere and yet nowhere in particular. It also seems to be represented by close associates, friends and well-meaning people of all stripes and types. Finally, there is THE PROBLEMATIC ENDING. Clayton apparently bags the 'bad guys', but hardly rides off into the sunset. He hails down a cab and give the cabbie fifty dollars and tells him to 'just drive'. But where is he going now? Somewhere or nowhere?Tilda Swinton as Karen Crowder is unknowingly manuevered into being the femme fatale. A role for which she is tempermentally and physically unprepared and unsuited to play. The key to this assertion of mine has to do with SELF IMAGE. We see Karen rehearsing her speech while brushing her teeth and at other odd, informal moments and panicking that it may not be good enough. We also see her preening and posing before a mirror, making sure all the lines on her new wardrobe are just right. She is doing everything she can to evolve and establish and create a SELF IMAGE of herself that she can better accept and enjoy. She has joined an organization that has enabled her to make herself a work in progress and now at last she can putting the finishing touches on her own reinvention. This reinvention of herself as a tough-minded, high-powered executive seems worth the sanctioned liquidation of two bothersome employees who, after all, simply couldn't cut the mustard.But when she finds Michael Clayton waiting for her outside in the hallway standing up, alive and breathing, her carefully cultivated SELF IMAGE is pulled up by the roots and starts to visibly crumble. She attempts to use her feminine wiles on the man she just recently marked for death, but lacks experience and practice when it comes to doing that sort of thing. Clayton berates her for trying to have him killed when she could have just bought him, as he makes it obvious he didn't have the moral will to do what his friend Arthur Edens was prepared to do to expose the corruption of her organization and company. But his actions now demonstrate that since the attempt on his life, he has had a change of heart and is able and willing to pull the rug out from under her and anyone else involved.When Karen Crowder sank to her knees onto the carpet, I felt like I had just witnessed one of the most violent acts ever perpetrated on a person in any relationship. It is one thing to destroy a person physically from the outside, but quite another to destroy a person from the inside by destroying an image of themselves that they may have labored years, perhaps all their lives to create. My heart went out to Karen Crowder as the injured party more than it did to Michael Clayton and I was surprised to find myself feeling that way. Something was exploding inside her and breaking worse than anything triggered by any bomb. The impulse to rush toward her and offer her comfort also included the fact of her gender. This was a woman and she should be spared this kind of public pain. After all, she was just trying to do what was best for her community. She was just doing everything she could to BELONG.Therein lay the great truth that had eluded me all this time. It explained why we would go along and tolerate those among us uttering racial epithets and why so-called goodhearted people will tolerate the most egregious atrocities as long as these are kept at a distance or even more conveniently out of sight. There is within our very nature a basic need to identify with the strong rather than the weak. We all yearn to feel strong enough to BELONG. There you have one of the great truths of Life and People. PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THAT FEELING OF BELONGING. Perhaps this is the consummation more devoutly to be wished than to give a cabbie fifty dollars to drive you around to no place special or to anywhere you might really belong...This I learned from Tilda Swinton's performance as Karen Crowder, and believe she richly deserved her Oscar award. She revealed something to me about the human heart and human soul I was not prepared to know or prepared to see. This insight is a gift for a lifetime and I am prepared to treasure it for all it is worth.",Michael Clayton

What sets this apart is the quality of performances and excellent direction. Clooney, Swinton, and Wilkinson are top class. The director also makes the film more interesting with the relatively slow movement of the plot at the beginning. There are some great scenes, such as those with Clayton doing his work and forced to bring his son along with him as he has custody for the day, as well as the murder scene.

Wilkinson is also brilliant, and probably gives the best performance of the film. He is one of the best character actors around, and this is why. I also loved Swintons subtle performance.

152,rparham,Michael Clayton a different kind of thriller,8,8 December 2007,"Michael Clayton is not your typical legal thriller. Oh, it has most of the standard trappings of one: double-crossing, shady back room deals, and a guilty client. But in the case of Michael Clayton, the film focuses most of its attention on the questionable moral quagmire of working for guilty clients, living your life protecting those who you can't help but find reprehensible, wanting to get out, but finding you are good at it and that is where your superiors want you. Michael Clayton isn't a revelatory film, but it is a smart one that deals in the grey world that we all live in, not the black and white one legal films are usually about.The central character is Michael Clayton (George Clooney), a ""fixer"" at a major Manhattan law firm. His job entails him cleaning up other's messes, not litigating in a court room. He hates the work, but the senior partner at the firm, Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack), wants him to stay in the job because he has a talent for it. Things are not rosy for Michael right now: his addict brother has run a business venture that Michael was a partner in into the ground, leaving Michael with thousands of dollars in debt; his relationship with his ex-wife is on the rocks, and into this environment comes a whole new caliber of problem: Michael's friend, and fellow attorney, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), who is a lead attorney for a major case for the firm involving U/North, a huge, multifaceted corporation, has discovered evidence damning to U/North, and has also, seemingly, lost his senses.Arthur begins plotting to publicly expose U/North with this evidence, thereby destroying them, something that U/North's lead corporate attorney, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), cannot allow. Michael is called in to help calm Arthur and bring the situation under control, but it becomes quickly obvious that Arthur cannot be reigned in, and Karen begins looking at far more dire methods of containment.When you walk into Michael Clayton, you need to be prepared for a limited amount of action, and a fair amount of talk. It is a film about words and far less exciting events than found in many movies. Michael Clayton is also not the most straightforwardly plotted film. A great deal of information is suggested through inference and requires the full attention of the audience. But Michael Clayton is hardly boring. It delves into the decisions that individuals make when their livelihood depends on living in a moral quagmire. Michael is a man who is concerned about making sure that he can make the payments on a huge debt and dealing with the sometimes annoying and reprehensible people that the law firm provides its services to. Arthur is in a similar situation, but he can no longer live with himself and the protection of clients who are obviously guilty. It is debatable whether Arthur is mentally unhinged, or simply woken up to the reality of his actions and what they mean in the grander scheme of things.Michael Clayton is the directorial debut of Tony Gilroy, a longtime Hollywood screenwriter, who crafts a film that manages to keep you involved like a good thriller without providing many of the requisite elements: chases, shootouts and fisticuffs. Michael Clayton is a thriller that works at a slower pace, but still manages to enthrall with its developments. Critical to the film's success is its performances. George Clooney gives us a Michael who feels many aspects of his world closing around him and tries to keep all the balls in the air. Tom Wilkinson's turn as Arthur is that of a man who has experienced an epiphany, seeing the world like a newborn baby. Finally, Tilda Swinton's Karen Crowder is a woman who is all about appearance (one of her first scenes reveals her practicing a speech so that it will appear perfect) and ensuring that no one rocks the boat of U/North. She has sold her soul to the devil and will do anything to keep the company intact.Michael Clayton is certainly not everyone's cup of tea. It requires a strong attention span and a willingness to not have everything spelled out for you. If you can provide that, then it is a film experience that will provide some rewards.",Michael Clayton
153,ssvikas,"Intriguing Plot, Great performances by George Clooney & Tom Wilkinson!",8,2 October 2008,"Hollywood has the uncanny ability to pull off movies with intriguing corporate and legal plots and what more, top of the line stars, give life to these characters. One complaint that one may have after watching this movie or after reading reviews by is that the story is difficult to grasp, or trouble understanding some dialogs till you get fully into the movie much later. So, along with writing a review, I have chosen to include spoilers too.George Clooney plays the title role Michael Clayton, an attorney with a high flying law firm, Kenner, Bach & Ladeen as a Fixer by profession and is also a gambling addict who has just lost a lot of money. In the beginning we are shown a scene of Clayton driving in countryside after meeting a client; he pulls aside to take a look at some hillside horses; just then his car explodes! Flash back to four days before, then starts a gripping drama.A seeming failure in personal life, Clayton owes a big sum to gambling lords and the plans to open a bar with his brother are down too. His firm tells him that one of their leading attorneys, Arthur Edens, played by Tom Wilkinson suffered with mental issues while dealing with a class action lawsuit against their biggest client United Northfield, who’s corporate Counsel Karen Crowder is determined to pull it through by all means.If someone really had to take key credit for making a movie with a tag-line ‘The Truth Can Be Adjusted’ so gripping, it has to be the writer-director Tony Gilroy. Lead Performances are intense with George Clooney extremely convincing as a high profile legal fixer who also has an ethical edge. Though devoid of high octane action or unwanted twists, this corporate thriller will surely keep you glued to the screen! Thoroughly Recommended! Well, something that baffled me was how Tilda Swinton got the supporting actress Oscar? Probably, I would have never noticed her as much in the movie had she not won the Academy Award. Maybe she was better than her co-nominees! Or, maybe the voters saw something special that a commoner couldn’t. Instead, I felt that other Oscar nominees for the film, for acting, George Clooney & Tom Wilkinson, were amazing.",Michael Clayton

155,jacksflicks,Tribute to Classic Movies,10,3 May 2020,"Michael Clayton was released in 2007, a long time ago, it seems, because a straight, well-crafted, stylish, story-driven-but-character-informed movie, by and for adults, is an endangered species today, since adults themselves have become endangered species.Consider the leads: George Clooney, dressed, groomed and behaving like an adult; likewise, Sidney Pollack, the great director and here actor/producer. Even Tim Williamson's raving lunatic is an adult raving lunatic. Only the marvelous Tilda Swinton plays infantile-completely self-absorbed, obsessively rehearsing before she ""performs"" her encounters with others, be they bosses, board men or hit men. She's at once an amoral sociopath and a sad little girl. She reminds me of female reporters we see at press conferences, desperately over-trying.The story is familiar, but what makes this a great movie is how wonderfully it's executed throughout. Even bit parts, by Michael O'Keefe, Denis O'Hare and the precocious Austin Williams as Clayton's son, are memorable. Also memorable is the chilling professionalism of hit men Robert Prescott and Terry Serpico.The perfect pacing, cutting, unobtrusive camera, and the brilliant script are due to the fact that director Tony Gilroy is also the writer. It's Hollywood film-making at its best and, alas, some of the last.",Michael Clayton
156,jemps918,such a waste of time and talent,5,13 February 2008,"A slow and strange snoozefestthe plot for Michael Clayton is actually pretty thin but stretched out by trying to complicate it with fragmented storytelling. Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a 'janitor', or an attorney that 'fixes' or 'cleans up' high profile people's messes. He is apparently the best at what he does, a 'miracle worker' even, but he is not able to translate it to his personal life with his botched up bar business, gambling problem and ongoing divorce. Then, he finds himself in the middle of his colleague going haywire, threatening the loss of their firm's major client.You will stay through to the end because you keep hoping for a clever ending, but the shock is because how simplistic it was all resolved. It begs the question, what was all that drama and build-up about? This should've been set in an older period, say, before the computer age (major plot hole right there). Makes you wonder why Clooney and his other veritable castmates Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Michael O'Keefe and Sydney Pollack went for it. This is the directorial debut of writer Tony Gilroy (Enemy of the State, the Bourne series), and while his quiet, observant cinematography is refreshing, Michael Clayton was sadly out of twists. It just seemed like such a waste of time and talent.",Michael Clayton
157,Ric-7,Why Arthur Went Mad - A Legal Comment,8,15 October 2007,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I can't add much that has not been said in other comments, but instead I will comment briefly on Arthur's madness.We don't have any reason to assume that Arthur was a do-gooder, or that he had a large social conscience, or that he would be unduly sensitive to the sufferings of plaintiffs--obviously Arthur would have faced many injured plaintiffs in the course of his career as a corporate defense lawyer.Instead, Arthur uncovered proof-positive that his corporate client is guilty of intentional harm--the weed killer was marketed with full knowledge of the probable harm. This is not just a civil action, but is probably also a crime.Arthur is faced with a potential career-ending dilemma. Assuming that the weed-killer is no longer marketed, Arthur has evidence of a past crime by his client, but no evidence of an intent and likelihood that a future crime would be committed. So under the rule of legal ethics, Arthur cannot reveal what he knows. If his client has lied in the course of the suit, he must call upon his client to correct the lie and if not, Arthur must reveal it to the court. No longer working on the case would not totally solve the ethical problem, because if Arthur remained with the firm, U North could no longer lie about advance knowledge, because a lawyer cannot ethically participate in the presentation of perjury, and Arthur's knowledge would be imputed to all members of the firm.If Arthur kept silent and just carried on as usual, he would possibly be criminally guilty of perjury, obstruction of justice. These ethical violations might end his career.So I think that Arthur's madness was not just a sudden development of a social conscience. The madness might have been an easy way out of the ethical problem--an escape from being responsible.And Michael Clayton was ultimately faced with the same basic career dilemma, and maybe Michael was just a little more capable than Arthur to resolve the dilemma and stay alive.I usually hate lawyer movies (being one myself), but this one was very accurate and insightful. Whether or not Tony Gilroy intended all of this, it's there. And it's terrific.",Michael Clayton
158,rhinocerosfive-1,"Tilda Swinton makes another okay movie great, but only for the scenes she's in",7,31 January 2008,"Every movie in which she appears should have an above-the-title banner: ""Tilda Swinton is in this film."" She is so very much awake, never at rest, never complacent, always trying something... when she ought to be. When she shouldn't, she does nothing. She is director proof, script proof, genre proof. She is inevitably better than everything else in her American productions. So perhaps the rest of MICHAEL CLAYTON simply suffers by comparison with her performance.Which is not to say that Tom Wilkinson and George Clooney are bad. They are very good. Nor that the movie as a whole is bad; it isn't. But a slick, cold Robert Elswit look isn't enough to transcend this script's tendency to rob itself of credibility.First, we are told that Michael is a miracle worker; he immediately denies it. Fine. But what does he do that's even remarkable? Tony Gilroy asks me to take it on faith that this guy is a fixer, without letting me see him fix anything. He in fact repeatedly fails to fix things - he can't keep his friend safe; he can't even keep his friend in a room. He can't make his son happy; he can't keep his family happy; he can't make a client happy, not once in the course of the film, though this last is what I'm supposed to think he's good at. This is what I get to see. Again, okay, fine; but, then, don't tell me the character is spectacularly competent and leave it to Clooney's presence to reassure me that it is so.Second, the drama is forced and not very dramatic. We know from jump street that they're gonna get Wilkinson, because we know that this is the only thing that might possibly motivate Clooney to break from his moral doldrums. Then, once it's Clooney's turn to get the big whack, the killers are immediately incompetent, for no dramatic purpose but convenience. This sort of lazy writing would be fatal with lesser performers... but don't forget: every fifteen minutes, we get a little more Tilda.Third, this is yet another Participant production that wears its politics on its lapel. Far be it from me to defend the culture of corporate malfeasance. I agree with everything the movie says about the dangers of big business. I just wish it had more of it to say. SYRIANA, basically the same picture, is a superior achievement in every way. Except that Tilda Swinton isn't in it.",Michael Clayton
159,seawalker,"A proper, grown up film",8,8 October 2007,"I liked ""Michael Clayton"" a great deal. It is a good, old fashioned, corporate conspiracy thriller that, 30 years ago, would have been headlined by someone like Robert Redford or Warren Beatty. Crucially neither gentleman would have been any better than George Clooney is in the starring role. I think that this is a tribute to how far George Clooney has come. He is now a bona fide movie actor as well as being a bona fide movie star. My lord, whisper it... He might even get an Oscar nomination for ""Michael Clayton"".George Clooney plays Michael Clayton, shadowy fixer for a high powered law firm. You got a messy problem? You got an awkward situation? You need a cool head in your corner, and the problem tidied up quickly and smartly? Clayton is your man.When a senior lawyer at the firm, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), working on a several billion dollar lawsuit, goes into serious mental meltdown, Clayton is called in to sort out the situation. What Clayton doesn't know is that Edens has been disturbed by certain evidence he has found while working on the case. Certain evidence that other interested parties most definitely do not want to come to light...""Michael Clayton"" is a great thriller. Smart, intelligent script and direction by Tony Gilroy (as tight and claustrophobic as the ""Bourne"" films). Great, multi-layered performance by George Clooney, and just brilliant support from Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton.A proper grown up film. They do not make them like that anymore. You must see it.",Michael Clayton

Its central case plot is also quite reminiscent of the one in ""Erin Brockovich"", which I find a welcome kick in the side of big-shot corporations that have no scruples whatsoever when it comes to destroying both nature AND people in the process of moneymaking...Nails all its performances to a tee, with Wilkinson an astounding standout!

U-North's corporate counsel Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) grows worried and later realizes that Edens may have some other agenda in mind, a trump card of sorts, that may threaten U-North, and she orders a couple of men to eliminate the problem. Add to this Clayton's own woes as he owes loan sharks big money. As Clayton attempts to help Edens, a tragedy occurs which reverberates with Clayton's own values and tests his resolve to delve deeper into an insidious world of corporate greed and murder. How far he is willing to go to save his own skin or find justice even if it risks his well being brings him to a defining point in his life.You know this movie has a high minded agenda and stamp of quality when some of the producers include Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich), Sydney Pollack (Absence of Malice), Anthony Minghella (The English Patient), and Clooney (Syriana) himself. Production values from camera-work to music are all topflight. Gilroy proves a sure-handed director and the film feels like the work of a veteran director of thrillers in the mode of The Insider or any John Grisham adaptation. like The Firm.Clooney does a very good job as Clayton, a man who solves problems for a law firm. A smart, talented man who knows the legal business, he also is human with a mysterious past. He is far from perfect with shortcomings including a gambling problem and debt, which makes him more identifiable to the audience. Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom) is quite convincing with his American accent as the legal giant who has apparently lost his mind (like Bulworth or Network's Howard Beale), and Tilda Swinton's company woman, is so good, you wish there were more of her. Swinton's talent is on the rise after such films as The Deep End. Sydney Pollack has been displaying his acting chops lately and proves to be equally adept at character roles (Tootsie, Eyes Wide Shut) as he is at directing.The film is quite strong and when it reaches its bravura, concluding scene, it rises to the occasion and elevates the plot to lofty heights and rarefied air. It is a supremely crowd pleasing moment and cinches Michael Clayton as not only an interesting thriller and mystery, but an intelligent, literate morality play highlighting a talented writer now director and its ever shining star.",Michael Clayton

You go out wondering if you should check your portfolio to see if you own shares of Unorth. Clooney, Wilkinson, Swinton, O'Keefe, and Pollack are the perfect people to play the roles, and the way the film begins is an exceptional tool to keep you nailed to the drama. There is an economy of scenes, nothing wasted, nothing there that should not be, and the suspense builds as surprisingly as a symphony by Brahms or Mozart. Granted, a writer should be able to direct his own story, but Gilroy displays an amazing lack of dictatorial persuasion and the actors become the roles. You leave with a satisfaction and a promise that all has been set right, and Michael Clayton will live to fight another day. Definitely not for the children, too much harsh language.

165,Ozzy2000,good drama,7,6 July 2008,"Written and directed by Tony Gilroy (previous works the Bourne Films) comes up with is slightly tedious film about corporate corruption, cover ups and exploitation. This type of story echoes other films like ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""The Firm"". George Clooney plays Michael Clayton who had previously been a top Prosecutor who has now become the ""Fixer"" for a law firm run by Marty Bach played by Sidney Pollack (he also produced the film). Clayton uses his extensive law enforcement contacts to fix up matters for clients of the firm such ""Hit and run"" incidents. The film commences with his car exploding just after he randomly chose to stop at the road side of a paddock to look at three horses and reverts to four weeks earlier by sub title notification and I find it rather odd they didn't say one month earlier. This event attempts to set the pace of the film where we learn, in a very clumsy fashion, that the main litigator for the firm Aurthur Edens ,played extremely well by Tom Wilkinson, has ""flipped out"" during settlement negotiations with a plaintiff suing one of his firms biggest corporate clients. It would appear that Clayton's firm is representing a huge Corporate client ""UNORTH"" against a class action for negligence for some dangerous chemical that killed many many people. It is not absolutely clear if Edens has really forgotten to take his medication for a mental disorder, been sabotaged with his medication or has had his conscious struck by guilt of crushing the plaintiff's in the class action with false information. The corporate client ""UNORTH"" represented by Karen Crowley played very effectively by Tilda Swinton decides to hire ""hitmen"" to murder Edens and make it look like a suicide as he threatens to undermine the class action settlement. Clayton discovers that Eden had turned and was murdered by Crowley's men and is attacked by the car bomb. The rest is predictable. This may get Oscars but why I don't know very ordinary film.Just a correction it was four days earlier not four weeks. Goes to show just how tedious the film was. LOL",Michael Clayton
166,thefan-2,"Do I LOOK like I'm acting?""",7,21 April 2008,"There are some very nice touches in this movie, one of the better-made entries in the ""serious thriller"" genre. The plot is fairly straightforward and unambiguous but is given a bit of tension by shifts in the time-frame.If it all looks a bit familiar, well, you don't expect the greedy corporation to turn out to be the good guys in these things, do you? And you certainly don't expect George Clooney to turn out to be the bad guy.Tom Wilkinson turns in a good performance as an over-the-top-crazy corporate attorney. Fragile-looking Tilda Swinton is okay, I guess; I mean, nasty corporate biotches can't all look like Fay Dunaway. But Swinton actually looks like she's on the verge of vomiting in a couple of scenes. Maybe a little eye-liner would've helped, I don't know.And then there is George Clooney. I think there should be a rule that reviewers and audiences not be required to take an actor more seriously than he takes himself. Clooney comes across, in interviews and autograph sessions, as a heck of a nice guy who knows full well that he simply got lucky in the looks department and who doesn't for one instant believe his own press. He wisely compensates for his lack of moves by keeping the Oscar moments to a minimum. This propensity for understatement has served him well. It's only when script and director push him too hard, as in the famous ""Do I LOOK like I'm negotiating"" scene, that he inspires giggles.",Michael Clayton

But it has grown on me in such a way, reassuring me with it's decided desolate aura, that I owe a review to those in a doubtful measure.Although it starts with some idle comings and goings, the first reaction we have is to alienate with Clayton. He is battered down, morally ambiguous, suffered. If one watches closely his eyes, one can discover within how a feeling of despair takes over. Clooney is a very happy, cheerful guy: you will appreciate his work, how he lets Clayton dominate Clooney.In here, the lawyer of the title must decide which side to take in an important lawsuit after his friend changes sides and endangers himself. Is he helping the good guys? How can he tell, deep Inside? The film carries the moral dilemmas, the strangled fight between choosing the good and the correct. Gilroy commanded a brilliant, harrowing script. But Clooney is the definite star, with his sadness, empathy. His sorrow is deeply moving. The Grey, moisturized environments, carefully veiled with a soft mist. Clooney's interior acting, arising within his foggy emotions. This film is not cheerful, it's somehow depressing.

169,dtb,"Now's Your Second Chance to See This Stark, Stunning Thriller in Theaters",9,26 January 2008,"Getting a second theatrical release in time for the Oscars, MICHAEL CLAYTON (MC) is well worth the effort of getting out of your house and into your local movie theater. A gripping, intelligent thriller about what can happen when a killer shark lawyer grows a conscience, MC boasts one of George Clooney's most powerful performances to date, as well as a stark, sleek, stunning directorial debut for screenwriter Tony Gilroy.A ""fixer""  or as he bitterly refers to himself, a ""janitor""  at New York law firm Kenner, Bach & Ledeen, Clooney's Michael is like a Cary Grant whose life is falling apart along with his confidence. He's sick of helping rich, amoral clients squirm out of the punishment they deserve (like in an early scene where he's called to Westchester to advise a client involved in a hit-and-run), and he's almost broke from alimony payments, a gambling habit, and a failed restaurant he'd opened in hopes of escaping the law rat race and helping his ne'er-do-well brother finally hold a job. Like Michael doesn't have enough on his troubled mind, his friend and law partner, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson, reminiscent of the late Peter Finch in NETWORK) ditches his bipolar meds and has a meltdown in the middle of successfully defending U/North, a chemical company involved in a class action suit involving weed killer that kills more than just weeds. Our conflicted hero finds himself caught in a web of danger, paranoia and corporate intrigue; poor guy, if it's not one thing, it's another! MC has the great performances, deliberate pacing, and chilling, claustrophobic feel of the best paranoia thrillers of the 1970s. This is no mindless, throwaway fluff here. We see a darker, more vulnerable, more intense Clooney; Michael Clayton is definitely not Danny Ocean, Attorney-at-Law. Tilda Swinton is compelling as Karen Crowder, Arthur and Michael's adversary in the weed killer class action case. Karen and Michael are strong and vulnerable in the same areas. Michael's persona as his law firm's confident fixer masks his rocky personal life, and Karen's strong, tough demeanor is a carefully rehearsed façade. Hell, when we first meet her, she's alone in a rest room stall, panting, armpits drenched in sweat. Even Karen's business suits look bunched-up and nervous. Always editing herself, she manages to be ruthless and a paranoid nervous wreck at the same time, making her that much more dangerous.The New York locations, filmed in the gray chill of winter, are beautiful but forbidding and unglamorous, adding to MC's unsettling mood. In context, MC also has one of the most chilling movie poster taglines of the year: ""The Truth Can Be Adjusted."" Its 7 Oscar nominations were richly deserved, especially for the acting. Fair warning: the plot is pretty complex, so you really have to pay close attention. (My mom, who's no dummy, saw MC in Florida the same day I saw it in Pennsylvania, and she called me that night and asked me to explain the plot to her!) So what are you waiting for? Now's your second chance to see MC in a theater  take it!",Michael Clayton

What with performances from every actor being praised and pushed for Oscar, first-time director Tony Gilroy getting a pat on the back from everyone he encountered; Michael Clayton was that rare film that everyone enjoyed. It is so rare these days that we are given a really good mystery at the movies, that when we see one its like being given a great big gift.Michael Clayton (the character) is a fixer at a large law firm that has been working on a case for a major corporation called UNorth for six years. Suddenly, their lead attorney strips down to nothing but his socks in the middle of a meeting and goes running through the parking lot. This is when Michael is called in; to fix things, to clean up, to help UNorth win a case against families who have been poisoned by the run off from their factories. For seventeen years Michael has been cleaning up messes so that big, rich corporations can stay in power. For seventeen years no one has given a second thought to whether what they do is right or wrong; until now.Powerful performances abound in this fantastic legal thriller. George Clooney performs with quiet intensity as Michael, a man being forced to take a closer look at what exactly it is he does. Tom Wilkinson is the lead attorney, giving one of the most charismatic performances I've seen in years. And there's Tilda Swinton, finally getting the recognition she deserves, as Karen Crawford, the legal counsel for UNorth. All three went on to be nominated for Oscars, with Swinton getting a win. And yes, writer and first-time director Tony Gilroy deserves many a pat on the back for his sharply and intensely directed film. Gilroy received a writing and directing nomination and the film was nominated for Best Picture.Michael Clayton is a perfectly crafted tale of mystery; but it's really much more than that. It's a story of redemption, of choosing to do what you know is right despite what you will lose. Michael searches for reason behind it all, only to find there is none. And it all leads up to a riveting finale. Yes, Michael Clayton is one you definitely don't want to miss. 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",Michael Clayton
171,GMJames,Intelligent suspense drama with strong performances,8,30 January 2008,"Seven Oscar nominations, nearly 50 other awards and nominations from film boards and critics societies and generally positive critical acclaim. Also, the discriminating moviegoers who have spent the money and seen the movie in theaters have raved about ""Michael Clayton"".I saw the film before the Oscar nominations and I found ""Michael Clayton"" to be a well-acted, well-written movie. I like challenging films that does not always need to explain every move through the entire movie. Don't give away the punchline so early in the movie. Trust the audience's intelligence and in the end many will appreciate the ride. If more filmmakers (and studio heads) would heed those suggestions, perhaps there might be fewer cheesy, critically drubbed blockbusters.Why is ""Michael Clayton"" not a blockbuster? To some, it was paced way too slowly and many people got bored and bailed out. Other moviegoers thought it ripped-off other thrillers involving lawyers (e.g.: the numerous John Grisham adaptations. For the record, as much as I liked ""The Firm"", I found it, as well as ""A Time to Kill"" and ""The Client"" to be by-the-numbers and not very challenging.) Most audiences demand good to great movies but end up, by their own choice, watching expensive trash. At the risk of sounding condescending, what amazes me about ""Michael Clayton"" is that the movie seems too intelligent to be a Hollywood movie. It certainly doesn't hurt that award-winning filmmakers Steven Soderbergh, Anthony Minghella, lead actor George Clooney and co-star Sydney Pollack are credited as Executive Producers. I would guess that it guaranteed that veteran writer/first-time director Tony Gilroy's pitch to the studio heads at Warner Brothers was not going to compromise the film's vision with focus groups and last-minute changes to make the audiences numb.Maybe the film's marketing campaign turned people off. Sadly, there are many good to great films that did not do well at the box office for numerous reasons. As much as I believe that awards and ceremonies are problematic, the Oscar nominations can only help to get more people to check out ""Michael Clayton"".For the record, I gave ""Michael Clayton"" an 8 out of 10. The film did have some pacing flaws and did seem disjointed, especially the first 20 minutes. What impressed me was that the all the story resolutions made the entire film worth my time. It can be very easy to confuse people by simple time shifts but, like a completed crossword puzzle, the finished product is impressive.

Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), the lead defense attorney, has gone nuts and is compromising the case. Michael Clayton, the law firm's ""janitor"" (he cleans up messes for the firm, rather than litigates) is assigned to get things under control. But Clayton has other personal problems to deal with, including a gambling addiction and a loan shark debt obligation he can't pay, and dissatisfaction with his ""janitor's"" niche and not having been made a partner despite years of excellent work. In addition he has a difficult relationship with his ex-wife and is struggling to find time to be with his young son. This is a story that is suspenseful because the writer/director (Tony Gilroy) has skillfully crafted the story in time and place fragments that initially we can't connect and are later misled into wrong assumptions. The film was produced by Sydney Pollack (who won the 1985 Director's Oscar for ""Out of Africa"" and has two other Director Oscar nominations), who also plays a major role as head of the law firm that employs Michael Clayton (George Clooney). Clooney not only plays the lead, but is listed as an Executive Producer. Clearly Pollack and Clooney were so impressed by Tony Gilroy's script that they both produced and took major roles in the film. They were right in their decision. The finished film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and 6 other major Oscar nominations: Best Director; Best Sceenplay written directly for the screen; Clooney for Best Actor; Tilda Swinton for Best Supporting Actress as Karen Crowder, Chief Counsel of the chemical corporation and responsible for hiring the law firm; Tom Wilkinson for Best Supporting Actor; and, James Newton Howard for Best Original Score. (Actually, I was not even aware of the score as I was so into the story.)This is an intelligent engrossing film with an interesting story, inventive script and great casting and acting. All of the major characters are developed into more than caricatures. Unlike many popular adventure films, it does not waste viewer time and production money on expensive special effects, such as multiple camera angle shots in slow-motion of spectacular car crashes, explosions and fires, destructive torrents of water, and close ups of blood and gore, which have gotten so repetitious they no longer interest me.

That's just three out of so so many and if you think this monstrosity ""Clayton"" comes close, fuggediboutit.So help me, George Clooney doesn't change his facial expression for the entire movie.He looks as bored as I was. The plot was nearly impossible to follow, especially when one falls asleep trying to follow it but I do know it was about one big bad unscrupulous law firm representing the plaintiff versus Clayton's firm representing the defense and Clayton is a lawyer without portfolio because all he does is act as a point man and detective rolled into one. And he drives a Mercedes named ""Smokey."" As good as Clooney was in ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" that's how awful he is in this celluloid annoyance. Heck, George is ususally Danny Ocean.

174,eastbergholt2002,Serious Movie about Corporate Greed,8,21 October 2007,"Michael Clayton is a slick and competent thriller. It could have been made during the post-Watergate era when filmmakers saw conspiracies everywhere. It's essentially a morality tale about corporate greed and involves a company selling a product it knows will kill people. Having worked for large multi-national companies and worked closely with numerous internal lawyers in strange countries, I found the story far-fetched and almost risible. What annoyed about me about the film is the ludicrous conceit that this film accurately portrays the way that big companies operate. Clooney plays Michael Clayton a lawyer at a major law firm in New York. Clayton is a former criminal prosecutor who is fed up with his job and lives an unhappy life as a divorced loner with gambling debts. A corporation is being sued for billions and Clayton's firm has helped bury its secrets. When a senior partner from the firm behaves erratically and suffers a crises of conscience Clayton has to fix the problem. When the partner suddenly dies in mysterious circumstances Clayton uncovers all sorts of skulduggery. The corporation's lawyers recruit a team of heavies to eliminate anyone that tries to reveal the truth. We watch Clayton's life unraveling as he becomes a target and faces a moral dilemma about what to do. The acting is excellent, especially from Wilkinson and Swinton. By the the end of the movie the evildoers are punished, but you feel as if you've seen this film before. The film would have been improved with some likable characters or some humorous banter. Ultimately the film takes itself too seriously, is a little depressing and is somewhat dishonest.",Michael Clayton
175,tubby1,Enjoyable thriller.,7,22 November 2008,"'Michael Clayton' is a finely produced and directed picture but has nothing novel to add to the legal thriller. Rather disappointingly, it contains the usual tools which are used in such films. For one, you have the shady figures, those requested to assist in a dark, grisly manner and have all the technical know-how, bomb-making and murdering expertise to boot. Secondly, you have a piece of crucial evidence that is vital to the plot but is never straightforward to ascertain.As previously mentioned 'Michael Clayton' is well directed and its high production values certainly give the film an edge, however, it is the acting which makes 'Michael Clayton' just a bit more than the usual run-of-the-mill legal thriller. George Clooney charms his way through, Tom Wilkinson is thoroughly believable, and Tilda Swinton acts with aplomb, but how she won an Academy Award I cannot really fathom.An enjoyable and intelligent film, 'Michael Clayton' has all the qualities to make it memorable but it lacks a creative edge that would make it that much more superior to others within this genre.",Michael Clayton
176,blackburnj-1,"Intelligent, well done but a little pointless",7,17 February 2008,"George Clooney has recently become one of the great men of Hollywood. He is an actor of great talent and a filmmaker of intelligence and integrity. There are, therefore, high expectations of every project he makes nowadays. But ""Michael Clayton"" was an enigmatic prospect. The trailer didn't seem to betray much of the plot and Tony Gilroy, best known for his work on the ""Bourne"" films, was an unknown quantity as a director. Having watched the film twice, to me it remains an enigma and more mystifying than that is its recent clutch of major nominations at the Oscars.The film starts off with a gripping sequence that turns out to be set near the chronological end of the plot. With a fantastic monologue from Tom Wilkinson to start off with, some unexplained shots of characters in a degree of stress and an explosion to cap it all off, your attention is gripped.It then emerges that Wilkinson's character has had a nervous breakdown and the first of the three great central performances in the film takes hold as Wilkinson seems to become childlike in an attempt for innocence. It is an astonishing turn. But, there is meant to be some suspense in this thriller, presumably based around the claims that the Wilkinson character makes about the case at the centre of the plot and whether they are true or not. However, all suspense disappears when a crucial piece of evidence is revealed very early on. So, the suspense isn't meant to come from the central case.The drive should surely come from the eponymous Clayton. But, he is not on a mission, at least not until very late on. You get the sense that he is dissatisfied with his job and his underachievement, but there isn't any sense that he is trying to wrestle his way out of this existence. He's just doing his job as usual. The promotional material in this film suggests that the movie is about truth. But we never see the truth being bent by anyone, let alone Clayton. Whilst you can sympathise with Clayton being left out of the loop, the audience is shown pretty much everything and, as such, they aren't kept in suspense. You know why everything happens and there isn't anything left to the imagination.But this shouldn't take anything away from Gilroy's script which, whilst it is far from perfect, is clever with brilliant dialogue and characters that are all perfectly formed. His direction is intelligent and is full of promise. Nor should you underestimate the quality of the performances. Clooney is fantastic, but Tilda Swinton delivers perhaps the most interesting and affecting performance.However, whilst there are many positives, ""Michael Clayton"" is quite entertaining, relatively satisfying but a little pointless. There is no real message in the film, no real insight and, whilst it is intelligent, it is nothing more than solid.",Michael Clayton
177,MovieZoo,Michael Clayton is all about the people,8,12 October 2007,"In a world over-run by corporations and lawyers, the little man rarely wins. It takes a big man to keep that world in order. But sometimes another big man comes along to show who really is the big man. Or is it a woman? That said, no big man would exist without the little man - the outsider.While you can watch this movie and see a good story develop, the story makes an interesting shift. The people become the story once the initial story has laid to bare the reason for the peoples' existence.I enjoyed it for that very reason. The characters were all extremely interesting thanks to great performances by everyone. Clooney, Wilkinson, Pollack and especially Tilda Swinton(White Witch from Narnia) - I am in love with her acting ability. I will be doing some back-tracking to catch up on what I have missed from her. In Narnia, she was deliciously evil and in Clayton, she couldn't be any worse at being evil, but that was her character. It was fun to watch how she made weakness such a strength.Wilkinson is such an all around great actor and makes his character seem lovable although pitiful and downright nasty for reasons I won't bring up here. Wilkinson definitely delivers.Clooney provided the best performance in a long time. I think Clooney has long been an interesting performer but this role is just one of his best - dedicated, sometimes mysterious, loving and charming; even funny and sad.You may look for more in the story line but you may miss the best part if you don't accept that the people are the story once the movie gets rolling.8 of 10",Michael Clayton

The cinematography alone gives away the fact that a far more sleek, smooth, laid-back, smaller scale than the epic Bourne films identifies Clayton. But the content is sizzling, scandalous and relevant to today's times. In essence, Gilroy has crafted an incredible exercise in style: A modern movie disguised as a classical piece of cinema. And classy it is.Gilroy's classic approach to filming the picture also embodies his writing style. The film opens with a fantastic monologue from character Arthur Edens that gives us not only a great shark-bite entry into the world of the film but also is just a fantastic piece of stand-alone writing rivaling the work of Paddy Chayefsky or William Goldman. In all the writing in the film is strong, sleek and stinging, containing some fantastic exchanges of dialogue, particularly between Clayton and Edens. What is particularly interesting and unique about the screenplay is its structure  and I'm not talking about chronology or anything like that. What is worthy of note in the structure is that Gilroy takes such tedious care and time to set up his very complex plot, with endless twists, turns, characters, procedures and so forth. And yet, he names his movie Michael Clayton. The film isn't about conspiracy, it's not about corruption in the legal system, it's not about justice, revenge, and has no political message whatsoever even though it would have been very easy to take the very same basic plot and turn it into a message film a-la Erin Brockovich. But instead, Gilroy chooses to focus his film on his main character. And yet, for a character piece, we don't really get to know that much about the character at all! Who is Michael Clayton? Character Karen Crowder asks one of her assistants this very same question early on in the film, and gets a rather thorough answer  date and place of birth, schooling and occupational backgrounds; his entire resume to the day. But is that it? Is that all there is to Michael Clayton? We learn so much but know so little about him! And why does he go to such great lengths, risk so much and put so much effort into exposing the corruption? Justice? Revenge? A personal vendetta? It's interesting that none of these traits even come near to matching the impression we get of Michael Clayton throughout the rest of the film.But Gilroy mustn't receive all the credit for making this work what it is. Of course, there is Robert Elswit's wonderful and classically traditional cinematography, and there is James Newton Howard's moody, mellow score. But truly, this film is an actor's film, and its four main ones deliver such pitch-perfect performances and dynamics between them, it truly is a fantastic wonder to behold.The only actor in this movie who comes close to a scene-stealing performance is Tom Wilkinson, classic British character actor, who does a fantastic job at delivering Gilroy's sharply-written and very particular dialogue while portraying his character's bi-polar disorder. But he never enters Dustin Hoffman-Rain Man territory, and restrains his undeniable scenery chewing to a performance worthy of note, perhaps his finest since his single greatest performance in Todd Field's In The Bedroom. Sydney Pollack does well as the godfather-esquire authority/father figure, pulling the strings and serving as a presence over the entire film. But the film's younger players deserve and receive most of my accolades and respect. First and foremost is George Clooney, who in the last few years has been delivering great work after better work after incredible work. Like his comrade Brad Pitt, Clooney has truly been evolving very recently as a bona-fide actor, with brilliant turns in O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Ocean's Eleven, Good Night and Good Luck, and his peak role in Syriana. With Clayton, Clooney can add another serious, heavy-handed, subtle and fantastic piece of acting to his resume, alongside the more comedic and dashing fare he's also so good at. A modern-day Cary Grant? With an edge; yeah, I can buy that. But the true stunner is the goddess Tilda Swinton. What a fantastic piece of acting she delivers in this film; it's truly remarkably stunning to watch. Her neuroticism, her intoxication, and her blind devotedness it's thrilling to the point of creepy to watch as she meticulously prepares for each and every moment. And the true peak comes as she and Clooney stare each-other down in the thrilling finale when everything comes together.This film is so well written and intricate, I still find it hard to believe that it is based on an original screenplay and not one adapted from something like a John Grisham novel. Gilroy's gift for thick-rooted reality gives the film a feeling of credibility and also serves as a stage for some of the most slick, well-written dialogues of a recent film. Also, the film's four major players do just such incredibly fantastic jobs in their roles, it truly is remarkable. An entertaining, thrilling ride into legal intricacies, well-written dialogue and great acting make this a highly recommended film for those who aren't afraid to think.",Michael Clayton
180,vishal_wall,Confusing narration leads to a worthless wait,5,10 March 2008,Clayton is a lawyer who is known as a 'fixer' . He is called to fix a situation by his firm. Soon he finds himself embroiled in the eternal battle between good and evil.Extremely substandard film. Story line is weak and very confusing. Narration is incomprehensible and after a point becomes too much to bear. In the first 35 minutes some 5 tracks are left open. By the time you realize whats going on you realize you have seen it in 200 other films and its not interesting. Clayton finds a document which can ruin the CEO of the company? How intelligent piece of writing. A complete waste of time. A mediocre attempt. 5/10.,Michael Clayton
181,cdelacroix1,A Story connected with a Story connected with a Story,8,6 November 2007,"I'm probably one of the last commentators to make an entry for this movie. But I was just struck today with how well this movie ""wears"" for me. It's been in first run release for about 3 or 4 weeks now, during which time I've seen it 3 or 4 times. And I'll probably see it some more.The acting is great, the cinematography is great, the storyline and scripting great ... but what really make this movie for me is the interconnected storylining.Stories seem to be given to us at three levels: the personal story, the professional story, and what might be called the miracle story, or the story of the X-Factor.So we have Michael Clayton's personal story, interconnected with Michael Clayton's professional story, interconnected with the personal and professional stories of Tom Wilkinson's Arthur, and the personal and professional stories of Tilda Swinton's Karen. Then the story of the child, Austin Williams' Henry, and the extraordinary story of Realm & Conquest. The latter captivates Henry, and the manic Arthur, and introduces us to what might be called yet another storyline, the Story of the ""X Factor"" - a transcendent, extraordinary, beyond-this-world window through which Arthur gazes to organize his world, just as Henry does as well. This is a world in which Miracles are alluded to seriously, as we gradually work our way through the movie, pacing our way through the personal and professional stories swirling around our main characters, finally arriving at the extraordinary scene in which the X-Factor seems to overtake and demand the attention of Michael Clayton: the much-discussed scene with Michael and the three horses.I have to admit that the Director Tony Gilroy gives what is probably the most authoritative explanation for the horses. See http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34448. Basically he says Clayton had had a long past few days and saw these three horses and went up to see them to chill out a bit. Maybe. But this doesn't account for an implausibly coincidental series of linkages between this scene, and the picture of horses in the Realm & Conquest book, allusions to horses elsewhere in the movie, and most saliently the (yes) miraculous manner in which Michael Clayton survives a murder attempt: for if he hadn't stopped his car to approach these 3 horses, he would have been blown up in his car. This is the X-Factor. This is the Miraculous appearing suddenly and unexpectedly and changing Michael Clayton's life as it changes the lives of others.What follows, I'm sorry to say, is one of the more implausible scenes in the movie: Clayton throws his i.d. into his burning car, and is then reported as having been killed in the car ... even though the police surely would find that there's no body in the car.All in all, though, this amazing movie delivers a beautiful, gripping, compelling set of stories, all centered, of course, on the person of Michael Clayton.George Clooney's Michael Clayton is brilliantly acted, a real tour de force. The final scene, in the cab with the credits, is worth staying for and gives an absolutely extraordinary look at Clooney's ability to act by facial expressions alone, as his Michael Clayton lurches through the streets, looking this way and that, decompressing, wondering, reflecting, fearing, wondering.Tom Wilkinson plays Arthur authoritatively, portraying a manic-depressive with convincing precision, and giving us a look at the powerful lawyer as well that is all the more extraordinary for being played in a scene with an armful of bread as a prop.Tilda Swinton's Karen is really amazing - she gives us confidence, with harrowing looks at the anxiety-ridden person underneath the professional persona.Austin Williams really does a splendid job as the youngster Henry, and I'm hoping we'll see some more of this fine young actor in the future.And Sydney Pollack's Marty is a very convincing portrait, rounding out a cast giving us great supporting roles.This is a very dark movie, with lots of night-time shooting, and even the daytime shots tend to be dark or look like they are begging to be done under cloak of darkness. Especially striking for me are the visuals of a cold, dark city, with blinking lights and civic mechanisms (traffic, cabs, phones, etc) everywhere. There are lots of shots either through windows or in reflections on windows. Lots of indirect lighting, seeming to undergird the indirectness of so much that happens in this movie.All in all, I think anyone who likes great story-telling, intricate plotwork, well-depicted characterization, great acting, and splendid cinematography will very much enjoy this amazing movie.Charles Delacroix",Michael Clayton

Then I saw the trailer, and it didn't make me any more interested. It seemed to be a garden variety, corporate corruption thriller. And they are a dime a dozen. Then it started garnering some good reviews. Then it was nominated for multiple Oscars. And yet I still ignored it. Finally, last night I caved. I wanted to rent a movie, but had nothing specific in mind. I saw Michael Clayton as I was browsing the store, and I thought, ""What the heck."" So I rented it and took it home. And then I started it. Instantly I knew I had made a serious error in judgment. I was engrossed, thoroughly, from beginning to end. Every facet of the film is solid. The acting, the screenplay, the cinematography...literally every facet of the film. It also contains one of the best acting performances I've ever seen, period. Tom Wilkinson is so believable in his role as the tragic Arthur Edens that he became a character that I truly cared for. And when he met his demise, it was painfully heartbreaking. His Oscar nomination was well deserved. Indeed, this was one satisfying motion picture. And now, it's not just a film I rented. It's one I own.",Michael Clayton

187,98nurdinm-1,"""Michael Clayton""",7,7 January 2010,"If you're looking for an intelligent, sharp, edgy thriller about big corporations, law firms and the little people, then this is the film for you. If that's not your cup of tea...well, then, obviously...yeah.Geroge Clooney is the title character, a ""fixer"" or ""janitor"", hired to clean up the mess when one of the most infamous lawyers around (Tom Wilkinson) goes off his medication and puts an important law suit into jeopardy. At first Clayton thinks the same as anyone else: that his friend and mentor is just feeling the after-effects of his condition. But when the man later turns up dead in slightly suspicious circumstances, Clayton realises there's a lot more to the case then meets the eye...At first the plot moved a little too quick for me. You've got to give the film your entire concentration, otherwise you'll be lost very easily in all the fast-talking dialogue. However, I soon got back on track and throughly enjoyed the remainder of the film. Clooney is in his usual fine form, a perfect straight man to the wonderful wild acting of Wilkinson and the nervous twitching of Tilda Swinton's character, who is more involved in everything then she would like to be. However, one cannot help feeling that we do not see enough of her character. And there is a very good hangdog performance by the late great Sydney Pollock, who was also one of the producers on the film.The script is tight as the plot thickens throughout, throwing a mini-twist that, though perhaps slightly predictable, does not make it any less satisfying. Overall, a perfectly fine intelligent picture, though you do need to give it your full attention to give it credit.7/10",Michael Clayton

In some ways, this might be one of the most satisfying of all of the films that were released in 2007.George Clooney, particularly shines here as the title-character: a so-called fixer, the go-to guy when his powerful New York law firm needs or wants a mess swept up under the rug. The mess in this case, is the firms top litigator, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) in a $3-billion case that has gone from advocate to whistle blower. Wilkinson is just amazing to watch here. So seamless and affecting. This is why I love movies. That scene at his apartment, with the thugs, just completely shakes you to the core...and it should.I think my favorite scene from the entire film, is that little scene between Clooney and the young child actor who was playing his son. Really struck a core with me. I also loved that long closeup of Clooney's face after the car-explosion.The thing I loved most about Clooney's performance, is the way we could literally see the wheels turning in his mind. I love that, and I love seeing an actor, granted a great actor portray that.Tilda Swinton is good in her role, but I really loved and was pulling for Romola Garai's performance in Atonement, for best supporting actress.That scene at the end between Clooney & Swinton is reason enough to see this film.",Michael Clayton

It isn't for everyone, but for me, oh, what an amazing, surprising breathe of fresh air. The storyline isn't original; but the dialogue woven around the events is absolutely sublime. Anchored by the pitch-perfect, controlled performance by George Clooney, and supported with complete deftness by the 'actor's actor' Tilda Swinton, the amazing Tom Wilkinson as Arthur Edens, and with the rare and precious appearance by Sydney Pollack, Michael Clayton is a performance-laden dream. Everyone who showed their faces in this film, was terrific. But it's this screenplay, which carries Michael Clayton, as precise as hand-blown glass. The film begins near the end, and folds in on itself in a very effective way; done better than most, and without gimmickry. When we catch up to the present, where the film began, the impact was surprisingly jarring. The technical aspects of Michael Clayton also excelled, with great cinematography, editing, and art direction. For me, this is the film I'm hoping most to see receive some hardware.

In fact it manages to subvert many expectations along the way by avoiding cliché and instead focusing on an interesting central character who is neither hero nor anti-hero. He's just a guy with flaws like any of us played with extraordinary reserve by George Clooney. His performance is indicative of the overall approach the film takes...subdued,pensive and precise are things that could be said of the films look and editorial pace.

192,mistarkus,The Dark Side of Lawyers,9,3 January 2008,"High powered attorneys, corrupt in house counsel, and ""fixers"" working in law firms create interesting food for the movies which is a unique twist to a somewhat typical movie genre. Much of the films concerning the subject matter of law usually culminate in a dramatic trial. This movie never sees the court room.About a well respected attorney in a prestigious law firm. Michael Clayton doesn't quite work as an attorney. He uses his legal knowledge and skills to clean up messes the firm gets into, hence his identity as a ""fixer"" or the negative connotation of the ""janitor"". A senior litigator who is working on an important case for the prestigious law firm has a nervous breakdown and goes nuts due to the moral scruples he develops from his many years of hard work on a particular case. Michael Clayton is called in to save the day for the firm and its client.An interesting portrayal, whether real or sensational, of how far the high powered players will go and how minuscule their scruples are.The story is well crafted and interesting. Everything comes together nicely in the end. The movie provides us with inferences and clues as to where the characters are going to end up after the movies conclusion. The movie will resonate with you, as you piece together the inferences to come to conclusions about the characters' futures. So you obviously care about these characters whether hoping for the best or the worst.You would think that a high powered ""fixer"" for such a huge organization would come across as sharp, quick, confident, with a swagger and style, - ""the man"". However, what was interesting was that he wasn't like this at all. Michael Clayton is not happy with what he is doing; he wants to be a real lawyer and has his own moral doubts about his work. Clooney does an excellent job portraying the characters tired, overworked, confused and unassuming persona. The movie could have been better if it delved more into this interesting character study.Overall an interesting story and twist on the lawyer genre portraying the dark side of attorneys. An interesting unconventional character was created.",Michael Clayton

The movie's message is that there is more to life than making money.The acting is uniformly good but Clooney is outstanding. His character is complex and he's pretty unhappy with what he has become.

This movie is not boring. It just doesn't whiz along with one implausible twist after another. It's evenly paced with an almost complete lack of silly plot lines (there was no need for the lawyer in crisis to remove his clothes during a trial).Everyone involved in this movie deserves praise for producing a challenging, grown-up, movie-with-a-message in the face of a torrent of mindless nonsense.Highly recommended.",Michael Clayton
194,imdb-45,Truly great film that requires your attention,10,11 February 2014,"This is a great thriller and a fun ride. It's also a little bit of a character study. It's a pity that most of the reviewers who rated this film poorly (a) couldn't understand that this isn't another Jason Bourne action film, and (b) couldn't keep their ADD in control long enough to focus on the story and the related subplots, and (c) appreciate that some attention was paid to the character that is Michael Clayton instead of yet another cardboard cutout action hero.Clayton is a lawyer in a big firm. He is also ""the fixer"" - the guy who the firm sends out to take care of issues before they spiral out of control and in silence. When a wealthy man strikes an innocent pedestrian while driving drunk, the fixer is sent out to calm the man down and survey the situation. Clayton's frustration is that he wants to be back in court but the firm believes he's too good of a fixer.The main plot revolves around the firm's defense of a class action lawsuit. Clayton's friend and fellow partner/attorney in the same law firm seems to have lost his marbles and Clayton is called in to speak to him and fix the problem. They suspect that this attorney is off his medication and perhaps doing things that could harm the case.Clayton has his own issues and isn't perfect. He's far better at handling the lives of others than he is his own. Big business is a corrupt world with many players who lack scruples and friendship may not be loyalty even in the slightest degree. Who can he trust? Is someone trying to remove him?This is a fun film. But it does involve a number of different characters. If you leave the film for 5 minutes to buy popcorn you could lose a large part. If you're waiting for the shootout and guns to fly, this isn't your film. This is a fun chess match with lots of witty dialogue and suspense as the story unfolds. The performances are terrific by an A+ cast. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.

195,majic-5,Solid but unspectactular,6,28 October 2007,"Michael Clayton is your standard corporate-setting thriller, enhanced with good, understated acting by George Clooney, in the title role.When we meet Clayton, he is in a mid-life, mid-career crisis. For 13 years, he's worked at a prestigious corporate law firm. He hasn't made partner, because he doesn't work as a lawyer there (although he is a lawyer). He's a ""fixer,"" a specialist in discreetly cleaning up the messes that the firm's clients make in their private lives. In the opening scenes, Clayton is performing damage control at 3:00 AM on behalf of a client who just left the scene of a hit and run. The client, upset, takes out his emotions on Clayton. Clayton responds calmly and professionally, but you can sense his weariness at cleaning up after others for so many years.Clayton's biggest continuing mess is the firm's senior litigation partner, Arthur Edens, played by Tom Wilkinson. Edens is a manic-depressive with a penchant for going off his meds occasionally. During depositions in a 3-billion dollar class action suit, Edens finally goes off the deep end, making the kind of trouble for the law firm that's not easily contained. This provides the basis for the plot.Wilkinson gleefully chews through all the scenery the film hands him, reminiscent of Al Pacino's screen-grabbing roles. In his manic tirades throughout the film, he calls Clayton a ""bag man"" and a ""janitor,"" labels that Clayton acknowledges, but increasing becomes uncomfortable with. As he tries to keep a lid on the Pandora's box that Edens has opened, he comes to an epiphany in an outburst at one of the law firm's most senior partner: he wants out. But in order to get out, Clayton is going to have go deeper into the muck, and Clooney hits all the right emotional notes as a man gritting his teeth to finish his last clean-up job.The only quibble I have against this movie is the climactic scene. Up until it, Clayton, has been cautious and reserved. Here, he acts bombastically and almost recklessly. It certainly got the audience's juices flowing, but in retrospect, it didn't quite jibe with the rest of Clayton's character.There's nothing in the movie that demands seeing in the theater, so rent this film when it comes to DVD.",Michael Clayton

So of course being that he's the fly in the ointment of the defense attorneys in a class action suit, he needs to be brought under control not to mess it up beyond repair. Clooney's character, Michael Clayton is also going through a sort of similar but less dramatic an ordeal, though he is trying to keep it together. This movie is so 'precious'; like American Beauty and so many of the neo-American dreary flicks that have become fashionable in the last 15 or so years, it's another throw away lamentation on an EXCEEDINGLY tedious theme.

Clayton is sent in to sweep up and save the day, but somehow gets himself on the wrong side of everyone involved, with disastrous consequences. It is hard to believe this is a directorial debut of anyone. However the fact that it is the work of Tony Gilroy starts to make sense. Gilroy is responsible for adapting the Jason Bourne novels. The film is amazingly polished and well made. There are some issues that are inherent in the story itself and I don't think could have been overcome by Gilroy without a few more rewrites.

The ease with which the 'bad guys' mount their black bag operations is also unbelievable.The nuanced performances by Clooney, Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack elevate this film above its script.

199,j-penkair,Human Shock Absorber,8,11 December 2015,"I saw ""Michael Clayton"" again today probably for the 20th times. This film has amazed me of the right balance, timing, touch, probability, possibility, and still continues to be a wonderful piece of storytelling at my 20th viewing. The premise is most simple, bordering on a soap opera plot. A gray-area guy wakes up against the corrupt and evil surrounding he used to be all right with. He gets to the bottom of his personal and professional life, and wants to crusade against all the wicked hands that feed him. The central theme here is anguish, which I do not know any worldly and sane person not to have. It is a story of greed, money, betrayal, violence, and self-doubts. A few secrets of this film's success, as far as performances go, I believe, are the followings: 1) the likable nature of George Clooney's character 2) the absolutely non-penetrative nature of the character of Tilda Swinton 3) the wonderful madness of the character of Tom Wilkinson 4) the cold-blooded charm of the character of Sydney Pollack. These four main players are with realism and acting internalization. The director Tony Gilroy must have been a great explainer to get all the characters understand inside-out of what they are, aren't, up to, and not up to, otherwise it would have led to shallower performances. I think it is rare to find a film enable us to understand and take a strange compassion towards the so-called ""bad guys"" (in this case, including one very bad girl). The reason is that everyone operates in fear and instability. No one is God and no one is Satan by design. ""Michael Clayton"" becomes the film's title because the bucks stop here. You can follow his final departure from the Grand Ball Room to the escalator and into a taxi, whose driver is instructed to ""just drive for the $50's worth"", and you can judge if Michael Clayton of the world can continue to be a shock absorber for them all, being Gods or Satans. My opinion is: it is a worthily meditative ending of a worthy film.",Michael Clayton
200,javaman-7,"Wilkinson, Swinton and Clooney playing magnificently complex characters",10,25 April 2008,"Reviewed by Terry ""Java Man"" Meehan LakewoodBuzz.com Film Critic. Written and directed by Tony Gilroy. Starring George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, Sydney Pollack, Michael O'Keefe, Sean Cullen, Ken Howard & Denis O'Hare. Running Time: 119 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: In a stream-of-consciousness outburst, Arthur Edens (Wilkinson), an off-his-meds manic-depressive, opens the film by drawing us into a world of corporate treachery and legal duplicity. He has come unraveled when he discovers that the corporation he is representing is guilty of high crimes. At a deposition, instead of taking testimony, he takes off his clothes. Listening to the rant is Michael Clayton (Clooney) the firm's ""fixer"" and close friend of Edens. Clayton has been experiencing his own crisis of conscience. Both men work for Marty Bach (Pollack), the brilliant, ruthless partner who runs the firm, which is currently representing U-North, the company being sued for poisonous pollution. Watching a videotape of the deposition in horror is Karen Crowder (Swinton), the high-powered, ambitious chief counsel of the accused polluter. Edens' alarming unpredictability upsets the equilibrium of the legal proceedings and sets the major characters on unpredictable paths of their own.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java Mugs First-time director Gilroy has previously written the screenplays for the highly successful Jason Bourne series. In those three films, he created characters that were fairly memorable even though we hardly got a chance to know them as they went through their furious action-flick paces. It occurred to me that if he could make a film based more on character and plot and less on action, his characters would really resonate. This is that film.Not only has he created several magnificently complex characters, he has cast the roles superbly. Wilkinson and Swinton are two of the best actors at work today, and Clooney is a star who is also a very good actor. It is no surprise that the Academy has nominated all three, the only picture to get more than one Oscar nod for acting. Other standouts include Pollack as the high-powered boss and Cullen as Clayton's soulful son.But it is not just acting that makes this one of the year's best movies, deservedly nominated for Best Picture. It is a well-crafted suspense story in which Gilroy, like a latter day Hitchcock, is able to keep both his characters and the viewer on edge.The suspenseful style even carries through to the editing, including a dynamic, revealing crosscutting sequence involving the Swinton character. As she prepares for a crucial presentation, the action alternates between a guilt-ridden, nervous woman mouthing lines to her mirror and the same woman confidently delivering the same lines when her firm and career are on the line. The sequence not only adds to the edgy tension of the film, but also displays Oscar-winner Swinton's enormous acting range.",Michael Clayton
201,mathomas-28053,spectacular movie with gut-wrenching overtones,10,14 June 2018,"This is a spectacularly good film about a character very much like Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer/fixer. I watch it at least once a year, it's that good.I can't help but wonder, as I write in 2018, whether the makers of this film knew about Michael Cohen and decided he would make an interesting character for a movie. Clooney's fixer is getting older, wondering if the dirty dealers who've used him all their lives will now stand beside him in his retirement. He knows where ALL the bodies are buried, so they'll support him. Right?And of course, their betrayal of him is a surprise to no one except him, very much like Trump and Cohen. That is not a spoiler, because in the very first half-hour of the movie Clayton is nearly killed by a car bomb , which opens up the narrative question ""What's going on here?"" and ""Who exactly wants him dead?""Questions Michael Cohen (are the similar names a coincidence?) may well be asking as he prepares to flip on Trump and testify in the polonium-filled atmosphere of today's Washington-Moscow connection.A FEW COMMENTS ADDED DURING IMPEACHMENT: This fantastic movie shows the effects of decades of lies, obfuscation, corruption, and perjury on the soul. Nearly everybody in this movie has lied for power and money, and several have killed ""For a little bit of money,"" as Marge Gunderson says in FARGO. Some have even dedicated their lives to corruption and money. I hope we see the same breakthroughs during impeachment as we see here. At some point, usually in your late 50's, you have to ask yourself: ""What have I done with my life?""",Michael Clayton
202,m_shankar20,"I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.",7,1 April 2008,"Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a fixer in a law firm. His boss (Sydney Pollack) likes him and is appreciative of his 'niche' skills. Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) is the legal counsel of their important client. Millions of dollars are at stake. And a Clayton's colleague goes crazy.The film is a drama-thriller. It is taut and unfolds nicely. We get to know more about Clayton as he walks through his days in the storyline. He is bankrupt. He is trying to come out of his gambling habit. He has a son he is trying to live up to. But Clayton survives because his feet is firmly on the ground. He has no qualms about himself. He says he is a 'janitor'.George Clooney has a towering screen presence. Confidence comes easily to his persona. But in 'Michael Clayton' he is constrained by his situation. It is amazing and a sheer pleasure to see Clooney play the title character. He is restrained and brilliant. The supporting cast is equally good. They together turn this into an important film, which otherwise could have been a routine thriller.The closing sequence of George Clooney's close-up in the taxi is a showcase of his talents. He lives Michael Clayton in that minute or two like few actors ever have their character. A must watch.",Michael Clayton
203,h_sarp,Gripping film weakened by conventional ending,7,11 January 2021,"Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford present an image of USA, an image that stands against imperialistic wars, against injuctice in American society, against greed of big companies. It is clear George Clooney is carrying this tradition with all of his attitude and project selection.
Michael Clayton is yet another example of his resume. One which is tense and engaging for the viewer.
Always great Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton are very succesful in their respective roles too.
However, ending kind of ruins the film when the hero -even though against his all struggles- chooses the correct path and exposes the whole organization and saves the world once again as seen at many other films.
One can compare this with the ""Ghost Writer"" bu Roman Polanski and simply appreciate the choice made by the great director, who does not fall into the trap that one idealistic man saves the world.",Michael Clayton
204,ad_upclose,"Good, but not even close to Oscar nomination worth",2,10 February 2008,"A smart plot gives weight to this law-firm thriller. Clooney gives a solid performance, but no way is it one that deserves a best actor nomination. On the other hand Wilkinson and Swinton were quite good, justifying their award nominations. Although the story is solid, I was not intrigued enough by the overall movie to want to watch it again. It was quite boring with it's muddled presentation.Overall, a nice story but poor presentation. Along with Juno, this is quite overrated. I would have been happier if these two had been replaced by either Into the Wild, Sweeny Todd, Zodiac, Gone Baby Gone, or American Gangster. The 'wow' factor is desperately lacking in this legal thriller, one essential for the Oscar nominees one feels.",Michael Clayton
205,philjeudy,A complex intrigue,7,21 June 2020,You probably will need to see this movie several times to get the full scope of the scenario prepared by Tony Gilroy.

206,John K.-2,"Good film, but not for everyone",6,29 September 2007,"This is a well-made suspense film. It builds slowly, it features the key characters in sometimes agonising close-up, it weaves an intricate plot (a bit too intricate, in hindsight -- I'm still not sure why some events were included), and George Clooney is masterful as the morally conflicted character who does his best to hold his collapsing life together, while slowly realising that his role in life is not quite what he thought it was in any case.There are some things this film is not. It's not an action film ... if you expect that, it will seem very slow. It's not a warm and friendly film that leaves you feeling good about the world -- it was shot in winter, just to emphasise its coldness. It's not a comedy in any way, not even through being over-the-top. It's reality rather than escapism.If you like suspense, unflinching realism, stories of moral conflict, criticisms of corporate America, or George Clooney -- or if you're just in the mood to see that kind of film -- you'll love it. If you're in the mood for a film to wash away the cares of the day (as I was), choose something else.",Michael Clayton
207,giantpanther,decent film... but a best picture nominee? not quite,7,3 May 2008,"Even a 7 out of ten is a bit generous but the film was decent. I think I held it to higher standards because, by the time I saw this piece the film had already been nominated for a ton of academy awards and had won Tilda her supporting actress Oscar. Which was actually probably more of a nod to the film that an actual individual acting prize.Clooney does alright, he doesn't fumble the ball at any point and thats the main thing. I don't quite understand how he got an Oscar nomination for this performance, but then again I don't understand much with academy awards. With three Oscar big dogs producing this film Soderbergh (won best director for traffic), Pollock (also in a supporting role in this film, he won a best director Oscar for Out of Africa) and the late and wonderfully talented Anthony Minghella (won an Oscar for directing the English Patient) maybe it got its nominations that way.The plot is easy enough, take the film Erin Brockovich subtract the humor and ""warm and fuzzies"", relocate from the west to the east and there you go.This film doesn't have any flaws, except that it can be moderately boring. I hate bashing a film that is so well made and well thought out, but this film was just missing something that could have made it great.",Michael Clayton
208,andy-933-696608,I am Sheva The Destroyer,8,19 November 2013,"The truth in today's world is most often very difficult to find, or simply to comprehend. At times it can lead us into some sense of clarity, and it can also create even greater self-doubt within us. As the fixer, or bagman as he refers to himself, Michael Clayton (Clooney) has been the nurturer, the garbage man, ""The Guy you buy. Not the guy you kill"". Written and directed by Tony Gilroy, Michael Clayton is an invigorating drama with fully realized characters, battling the greatest danger that threaten to destroy and annihilate the people they hope to be.As the fixer for a prestigious law firm, Michael Clayton has served the role of the fixer for so long that his face is drenched in the guilt and shame he harbors. His work has gone from shoplifting housewives, corrupt congressman, and many more atrocities that would no doubt give him a greater incentive to look in the mirror and ask the big question, ""Who am I""? The pale, but confident expression Clooney gives to this character carries with it a lone sense of sadness as Clayton, now no longer in his prime is called to fix a mess colossal enough to shake the very foundations of his soul.After Arthur Eden (Wilkenson), a schizophrenic attorney labeled ""A killer"", played by Tom Wilkenson strips naked, Clayton is called in to handle the situation. The deposition involves a lawsuit against an agricultural products conglomerate called U-North. The general counsel is Karen Crowder (Swinton) a panic stricken lawyer that constantly recites the most basic of speeches, lacking any true self-confidence and any actual morality, despite the hesitation to acknowledge her own immoral nature. Not too long after Arthur's episode of clarity, as he proclaimed his divine revelation of being Sheva, conspiracies begin to emerge and challenge each of the characters in their initial quest for a soul.Arthur claims that he has destroyed lives with his years in the courtroom, and Clayton has sheltered so many, that with what little innocence he can display, he gazes at his young son Henry, knowing that the cruel world he's seen cannot touch him. Clayton though has been dealt a bad hand with luck, avoiding card tables, and scrounging every penny he can to pay his dept. His gambling addiction is merely a minimal contradiction within the conception of the character, but it does elaborate a form of weakness in dealing with the hardships of being the family savior, the problem solver, and the one who comes to fix everyone's problems. At one point, this status is presented within the context of whether or not Michael holds any firm moral ground. Already owing eighty grand to the mob, following a failed restaurant, and a drug addicted brother as the cause, Michael turns to his boss, played by Sydney Pollock in his final screen role for help. The assurance of his worth may be refreshing at first, but as valuable as Michael may be, that significance comes with a price.The film's plot is intricate in its thriller aspect, and it becomes clearer through the dialogue of the characters, but there is something deeper at hand within the film. There is a scene in the beginning of the film, where Clayton stops at the country side and gazes at three beautiful horses. One is white, one is brownish red, the other is brown but dark enough to be black, and Clayton is pale. It could be said that these three horses along with Clayton represent the four horsemen of the apocalypse, or with the slow walk Clayton takes towards them might represent a kindred desire to be one with the pristine purity and beauty of nature. Whatever it is, Gilroy leaves this scene mysterious, leaving more of the moral themes present within Michael Clayton as the central character's struggle to acquire clarity, mental peace, with only few coming close and actually realizing the ignorance of their indifference.George Clooney's performance is powerful and endowed with confidence as he captures the spirit of Clayton, whoever this man may be. Wilkenson in his powerhouse antics of sophistication, captures an addictive persona of madness, as his character admits his wrongs and attempts to rid himself of the parasitic coat he constantly rants about in his moral condemnation. Swinton in her Oscar winning performance is brilliant, and frightening as she plays Clayton's polar opposite. As the fragile and hesitant Crowder, Swinton delivers a performance that fully elaborates on the vulnerability of her character. At times she makes choices that she never fully acknowledges, thus deluding herself, and believing she has escaped karmic justice and the possibility of ethical judgment. The world of Michael Clayton is both dark and morally questionable, as Gilroy creates character's that live in a world where nothing is dependent on the truth, but merely what can be adjusted. The film is powerful in its performances, and even more philosophical as it challenges the corruption of corporate influence, conformity among the margins, and nature of choice regarding ethics. Michael Clayton in a way is an enigma. He seems fully realized, sadly this not the case, as he searches for truth in a world where honesty is but a commodity, rather than a principle.",Michael Clayton
209,luke-346,A legal thriller with blinding performances!,7,26 February 2008,"Michael Clayton is a film that chronicles the inner workings of a New York law firm over a four day period and through the eyes of its chief protagonist (Michael Clayton, played by George Clooney). Legal thrillers are a specific type of genre not suited to everyone as they usually have complex plots, intricately positioned dialogue and contain allegories to genuine corporate bodies. Michael Clayton does not deviate from this formulaic approach with the general premise for the film being inspired by an actual General Motors case from the 1970s in which cars would burst into flames upon impact, burning those inside to death (the case is also alluded to in Fight Club). In both the General Motors case and Michael Clayton a leaked memo reveals it to be more cost effective to pay out compensation on the company's malpractice than to change their methods of production. The company at the heart of the film, and this malpractice, is an agrochemical company called U/North. Interestingly the film is written and directed by Tony Gilroy, the man behind The Devil's Advocate; another film that interrogates the formalities of law and acts of malfeasance.Unlike The Devil's Advocate, Michael Clayton is a film that has suffered too much at the hands of its writer, it has been suffocated by an over bearing plot that stifles the story and tests the audiences patience. It is a slow burning thriller that takes its time by methodically and unnecessarily dipping in and out of its sub plots causing the central plot to be diluted and confused. The impression given is that it was tinkered with right up until the moment prior its release, the rearrangement of the chronological narrative via a ""four days earlier"" edit seems conspicuous given the delayed progression of its central plot. Perhaps studios believed that having an exploding car 10 minutes in, as opposed to 110 minutes in, might bear better with audiences. Being that the film is so convoluted it seems ironic that Clayton should toss his watch and wallet into the burning car to make it look as though he died  a foolish disregard for the abilities of basic forensics. It is conceivable that given the overworked and laboured plot that such an occurrence was over-looked on the authenticity of everything else, although I doubt this, it is likely that the film is attempting to toy with plausibility i.e. if we believe other events then we should accept this.There are, however, a few scenes that will prevail in people's memories long after the end of the film. The calm and collected murder that occurs is almost chilling, but the fashion in which it is executed is brilliantly metaphoric as it illustrates the procedural and meticulous manner in which a rapacious corporation can behave and instruct others to behave. The showdown between both camps during the final reels and the well-framed shot of Clayton as the credits roll are arguably some of the best moments of George Clooney's career. This is attributable to Gilroy's brilliance of direction, as his fresh and widely rudimentary approach is best suited to a film with such a demanding narrative. His framing technique is textbook as it superbly complements the narrative and in doing so elicits some of the greatest performances I've seen by the three leads. George Clooney, in what is his perhaps one of his finest performances to date, has been perfectly cast as a man of abhorrence and despair and one in which the audience will identify with. Tom Wilkinson is brilliant as a lawyer dancing on the edge of insanity as is the unscrupulous boss of U/North, Tilda Swinton; her character oozing iniquitousness.Michael Clayton is a better American film than many other legal thrillers on offer, but it's poor attempt to reminisce with classics unintentionally proves it's not in that class of film-making. Perhaps if Michael Clayton had been closer in simplicity to Gilroy's previous outings as a writer (The Bourne Trilogy) then, as it's been stated, Michael Clayton could have been the thinking man's Bourne. Instead I feel Gilroy has tried too hard to better himself and not distance himself leading me to conclude that it is not his writing that stands out here, but his direction.",Michael Clayton
210,MoneyMagnet,A decent thriller,8,25 December 2008,"I usually don't enjoy ""lawyer thrillers"" (Grisham type stories), but this movie was very well made, with an excellent screenplay. The characters were all memorable and the performances top-notch. The opening monologue by Tom Wilkinson is brilliant and really pulls you into the story and gets you wondering about who George Clooney's character is. I was thinking about these characters more after the movie ended than I thought about the plot line, however (evil corporations selling poison to consumers is not exactly a storyline we haven't seen before). Sometimes it is just a pleasure to sit down and watch a well-made and well-acted movie, though, even if the plot is not terribly surprising.",Michael Clayton

I have never heard of Tony Gilroy but this movie shock me at all nerve and made me pine down to my seat for this entire movie until it end. George Clooney and Tom Wilkinson give there best of their careers and should get Oscar notions. Tilda Swinton gives a great performance and so does Sydney Pollack. This film has a great story and has a very good for a film the starts with the end. this film has one of the feels to a movie that you can't forget it right after you see this movie.

212,mike3386,Worth a Second Viewing,8,1 March 2014,"So nice to remember that George Clooney is a good actor, especially when he doesn't try so hard, when he lets the role come to him like in this one. George has ""let"" himself be associated with some miserable stuff, e.g., ""Men Who Stare at Goats"" & ""Monuments Men"", where he had a central role in making that bomb.The other actors are superb, especially Tom Wilkinson, who makes the viewer actually believe he is having an on-screen meltdown. The plot is gripping, yet so believable, power breeds more power, more excess, more risks. And it's refreshing to see a ""favorable"" ending once in awhile . . . there are enough downers out there. Sometimes we just wanna cheer the good guys! Would have given it even more than an ""8"" except for some dark (visually) scenes, and some mumbled audio (George is often guilty of this).",Michael Clayton
213,polar24,"A smart, complex, tight thriller led by a charismatic force",6,24 December 2007,"Michael Clayton represents the everyman striving for human morals and ideals in a world ruled by corporate conglomerates. We often are bombarded with struggles between man and evil corporations polluting our homes, airwaves, forests and rivers. This is a classic tale of David versus Goliath. In the same way the small guy wins over the giant.George Clooney is a one of the most charismatic personalities in Hollywood, while not representative of the everyman with his suave style and charming good looks, he is believable as the classic battler for human rights. He is pivotal to the film's success by influencing all the major events and causing an avalanche of headaches for the corporation. He is helped along by the complex and tense, yet somewhat talky script, and smart restrained direction. This is a bare-boned thriller based on raw cause and effect. The blows come from the devastating consequences of his actions to bring down a global behemoth for which the crimes we do not see but are explicit everyday. These range from the crippling social effects to apparent health issues and economic destruction. What car chases and cold-blooded murder remain in the film are sharp jolts overshadowed with the harsh fact that corporations always get want they want.The tone of the film is composed in muted shades of grey, lost in the pure void of commercial office blocks and eerie fluorescent lighting. This is complimented the by stillness of dusk and the lethalness of silent assassins. Much if the film's shocks and turns happen behind closed doors in main office blocks, and behind locked apartment doors. It is representative of the truth on the edge of revelation but silenced by the sly powers that be.While a little dry for my tastes, the tone suits the atmosphere and flavour of the story. It is a story that relies on the veracity and shocking truth of the events at hand. George Clooney is the perfect character for Michael Clayton, his ideals shadow that of his off-screen left-wing ideals and outspokenness for human rights. His fight against corporate and human justice seem to resonate with his fair and morally shrewd ethics. Plus did I mention his charm and charisma makes him so easy to like? This is a smart, mature story with some nail biting set pieces that should keep you on the edge of you seat for the film's thrill ride.",Michael Clayton
214,chemingineer,Good without being Great.,6,24 February 2008,"Yesterday evening I watched Michael Clayton. It is a good film, but not a great film; certainly not a film that deserves an Oscar nomination. I would rate Eastern Promises and American Gangster several notches higher and both of them do not figure in this year's nominations.Michael Clayton is about the mess in the morals and ethics of the American legal system or for that matter anywhere in the world, where the moneyed rich always try to hush up the truth, whatever it may take that to do. The premise of the film cannot be faulted, but the execution is flawed.Michael Clayton is supposed to be going through a personal crisis, but George Clooney, who essays the role, wearing a deadpan expression for most of the film, is unable to project it with conviction. Now that is not great acting, is it? Yet he has surprisingly earned an Oscar. One of the big failures of the film is that we can't empathize with any of the characters; not with Clayton's good friend who suffers a mental breakdown on learning the truth of the product of an agrochemical company that he is defending in a billion dollar class suit. The lady CEO of the company sweats in her armpits when she is hatching her sinister plots, but leaves us cold.The editor of the film seems to be overly obsessed with his craft. During the transitions the soundtrack precedes the scene, a ploy that is very effective in breathlessly paced thrillers, but jarring in a film like this. And there are those back and forth cuts between the CEO rehearsing her lines in front of a mirror and actually giving an interview to the television channel. It is plain irritating.The director needlessly tries to dramatize the storytelling instead of sticking to the good old-fashioned narration. The lengthy flashback and then the epilogue were unwarranted. What do we make of those three horses? Metaphors and metaphysics clearly have no place in a film like this. The politically correct ending leaves an uncomfortable feeling as you walk out after 120 minutes.But all this should take nothing away from the fact that Michael Clayton is a good film, one that deserves to be seen for its subject matter.",Michael Clayton
215,Degree7,A disquieting thriller.,8,20 October 2013,"Michael Clayton is an aptly described 'janitor' that does the dirty work of taking out the garbage for a giant New York legal firm, when cases prove too convoluted and complicated to handle conventionally (or ethically). Those words are pretty good descriptions for the plot, written by Tony Gilroy of the Bourne Series fame, which twists and turns with each new revelation only deepening the quagmire Clayton finds himself in. It was the cold, indifferent atmosphere that felt like an throwback to the thrillers of the 1970s that they just don't seem to make anymore of. Films such as Sydney Pollack's ""3 Days of Condor"" and Paluka's ""All the President's Men"" that dealt with the nihilistic and darker side of the rich and powerful, as well as shades of ""Network"" and the Noir trappings of ""The Third Man"". Michael Clayton wears its influences on its sleeve. What makes Michael Clayton particularly effective, however, is the subtle, heartfelt message of strength in retaining family bonds. The strength of those with a moral code, and the overall weakness of those without.Many character's achieve an understated redemption as they put their reputations, careers, and even their own lives on the line to seek out something that can only be described penance. While certain characters wash their hands of the ordeal, those that seek to destroy the truth and attempt to get away with it slowly realize how easily their world crumbles around them. The main character remains ambiguous in true noir tradition, but when questioned in a pivotal scene about his identity, he is lead down a rough and slippery path to self-realization. But it is Tom Wilkinson's character of Arthur Edens that remains the most memorable. A nice homage to Peter Finch in ""Network"", Arthur is the representation of the moral outrage bursting forth in uncontrollable, bitter resentment that secretly lurks beneath the skin. His performance is breathtaking, as he desperately seeks for atonement and babbles almost incoherently about the evils he's unwittingly taken part in for the case. His high-pressured mental breakdown and psychotic tirades may seem outrageous, but as a catalyst they really get the story moving along, and at certain points it seems like he's the only sane person in the movie.In retrospect, the plot seems very straightforward, but it is in the story's unconventional timeframe and unusual fragmented structure that really sells the film. The viewer's patience is only tested by how long they are willing to pay attention to important pieces of dialogue and piece the clues together themselves. It is difficult to talk about the plot without giving too much of it away, but taking part is made easy thanks to the impeccable performances of the cast, with stand out roles from Syndey Pollack, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, Goerge Clooney, and even down to the smaller parts. The film ends up becoming a cautionary tale that shows, among other things, the devastating effects of a single car bomb, and the lengths some are willing to go to cover up. This is a gripping and somewhat under appreciated 'legal' drama that is worth watching for the performances alone. But if you are also interested in a tale of very real corruption that goes on in the everyday world of big business, and how it intersects into our quiet home lives, then by all means watch this movie.",Michael Clayton
216,IheartCali5882,Very smart legal thriller. Not at all what I expected.,8,28 February 2010,"Michael Clayton tells the story of a lawyer-esquire type character played George Clooney. Clooney is what is called a ""fixer"" at a high-powered New York law firm. He's not a litigator in the conventional sense, but rather he is the one that cleans up the messes for the firm's clients when the situation calls for something more than a standard trial and verdict. In probably his best performance to date, Clooney manages to convey something that is hard to define but that all of us can relate to. He's not a bad person but some of his actions are bad and he knows it. He's got family issues, a gambling problem, and a battle of his conscience when the focus of the plot is revealed through his colleague's abrupt change of heart. Arthur Edens, played by Tom Wilkinson, is considered one of the premier defense attorney's in the country and is assigned to handle a sensitive case for a very important company. Edens conscience starts to gnaw at him when he comes upon some extremely damaging information. He handles this by having what equates to a mental breakdown in the eyes of others, and so Clayton is assigned to ""fix"" this situation with as little publicity and complications as possible.The beauty of the film is that everything is not so black and white. Just as in real life, there are gray areas. We try to do the right thing most of the time, but we don't always exceed. Sometimes we can't even make it half and half. So does this make us bad? Who knows? That's not what the film is trying to convey. Michael Clayton is imperfect. Sometimes he can be self-centered. Sometimes he makes awful choices. But he knows this, and also knows that given the chance to do the right thing for once, he would take it. Or would he? At times throughout the film it seems that even he doesn't know the answer to that question. This is what makes this character so human and relate-able. Here Clooney has turned in the best performance of his career.This is classified as a legal thriller, but it's very understated. Instead of high speed car chases, the movie relies almost entirely on dialogue. And what wonderful dialogue it is! It's fast paced and intelligent; a lot of things being left unsaid. This is not a film for those that require high impact explosions and edge of your seat excitement. It requires the viewer to listen closely and to make inferences based on what is left unsaid. I'm always so appreciative when a movie doesn't insult the audience's intelligence by spelling out everything as though they were kindergarteners.My rating: 8.5 Intelligent and engaging. I will be seeing this one again soon.",Michael Clayton
217,iKramerica-1,1 hour of story in a 2 hour package...,5,13 October 2007,"May contain spoilers, though I don't really think it does...There is nothing really wrong with the idea of the film. But there just isn't much there. The story was honestly about as ""deep"" as a 50 minute story on Law and Order.And despite what the commercials claim, this movie is PREDICTABLE. It didn't keep you guessing, as there was nothing to guess at. Where is the mystery? Where is the intrigue?The writer/director (there's a bad sign these days) jumbled the timeline poorly. The movie tries really, really hard to be intelligent, important and interesting. But it falls short. This is quite typical of writer/director auteurs, because they believe they are being profound but lack the critical laser that a writer+director team would possess. And because the auteur gets the first cut, they are way too close to the material, without enough outside experience regarding pacing, rewriting and moving beyond the mundane/superficial.And frankly, Michael Clayton is claimed to be the ""best at what he does"" and yet the writer/ director does not actually seem to know what MC actually does! It's never defined, you never really see him do ""it"" or if what we are watching is him actually doing ""it"", he seems pretty BAD at whatever it is he's supposed to be doing. It's not explained why he has no money considering his supposed job (and no, gambling doesn't explain it), or why the firm relies on him to do anything, and nobody really seems to respect or fear him, so what is his significance? His actions are obvious and clumsy. If he is who they claim he is, you'd expect him to be something like Winston Wolfe in Pulp Fiction. But instead, he's basically this impotent character who doesn't even know what is going on around him.That is the fundamental flaw of the film. Everything else is somewhat forgivable, but that just makes it a mediocre effort at best, despite some great actors who occasionally break through the clunky writing to deliver glimpses of brilliance...",Michael Clayton

219,jeffronthi,"No Childish, Hollywood Frills here!",8,19 September 2008,"My rating is an 8.5, Really.This movie is one that, while overtly character drawn at times, is sufficiently exciting, nonetheless. It does take its time, but is rewarding if you have less sensationalist sensibilities. It is important to remember that some of the most rewarding (and horrific) stories in real life, take time to become cohesive.I thoroughly watched this looking for flaws and found few. Most, if not all, of the acting was incredible, the direction thorough and sweeping, and the cinematography unsettling and haunting.I recommend this film if you are into good movies.",Michael Clayton
220,faterson,Tilda Swinton Stealing the Show: the Most Memorable Corporate Female Character Ever?,7,25 April 2008,"A superb crime thriller, dominated by Tilda Swinton's mesmerizing performance. Well, what she showed in _Michael Clayton_ was well worth not just an Oscar for a *supporting* role; I thought her to be the leading character, beside George Clooney -- after all, the final showdown is between these two persons. It is impossible to imagine any better performance in Tilda Swinton's role than the one we got to see here; impossible to portray this top female corporate executive more convincingly than Tilda Swinton did it. Given who she plays, it must have been extremely difficult for an actor to involve the viewer in this despicable character -- yet she managed to do that, masterfully; every muscle on her face got involved in this magnificent portrayal; Karen C. may well turn out to be one of the most memorable silver-screen murderesses of all time! Among Tilda Swinton's greatest moments, beside the showdown with Clooney, was the memorable dialogue in the street, with her ""subcontractor"", talking in code about ""absolutes, right?"". Memorable is also Karen's nervousness in handling the e-mailed ""self-explanatory"" encryption package. Karen C. is a fascinating character; not *once* in the entire movie does she give smile in a sincere, natural fashion; the one time she comes closest to a warm smile is when she... looks at herself in the mirror, preening herself just prior to the climactic meeting of the Board of Directors towards the end. Her nervousness and breathlessness after exiting the almost-empty Board meeting-room / auditorium, are portrayed to perfection, as is her nervous breakdown during and after her final conversation with Clooney. Fantastic and funny scenes are also those showing Swinton in her bra (and such), preparing her breakfast, etc., while rehearsing for her upcoming TV interview; her affectedness is delightful and at the same time repulsive to behold.Speaking of encrypted e-mails, this is a thoroughly modern legal thriller, true to the spirit of 2007: with cellphones (mostly Blackberries), laptops, flat-screen displays abounding everywhere to evoke the corporate setting. This is done in a natural way, without trying to impose on the viewer.The movie features superb performances, not the least of them the two actors in the two supporting roles portraying the two corporations' top executives are magnificent: Sydney Pollack and Ken Howard. Sydney Pollack sets the tone right in his first scene, speaking languidly and at the same time suavely into his cellphone, beating about the bush in his conversation with ""that c*nt from the Wall Street Journal""; and Pollack preserves this image perfectly right to the end. Howard is similarly flawless as the other top executive; his facial mimicry, every half-smile and enraged infection / tone of voice are right-on-target every time. A quiet, inconspicuous, but outstanding performance is that by Merritt Wever as Anna, the innocent farm-girl. Even cameo appearances in _Michael Clayton_ are played with extreme care -- watch the TV journalist interviewing Swinton.Geoge Clooney is a good ""sparring-parnter"" for Tilda Swinton, so to say; which is not a slight on his performance that is excellent and believable. His is a Phil Marlowesque character; and in the final showdown with Swinton, Clooney sticking his chin out cheekily, aggressively and threateningly, he is a credible blackmailer. However, there are just as many moments of tenderness and introspection for Clooney in _Michael Clayton_; his face is like a huge mirror, faithfully reflecting all the various emotions his character goes through in the movie. A great line by Clooney is, ""You didn't hire him for his low-key regularity, did you?"" A very good scene is that of a father-to-son dialogue, with Clooney assuring his son the little boy wouldn't be a failure later on in his life (with the unspoken addition of: ""... unlike myself"" -- at least in terms of financial prudence); such conversation may well engrave itself in the small boy's lifelong memory. Ironically, it is the boy's uncle against whom Clooney is warning the boy who provides crucial help for Clooney later on in a life-or-death situation.Another superb feature of this movie is the minimalistic, subdued, but dramatic musical score by James Newton Howard.As to weaknesses, Tom Wilkinson had a more difficult, more improbable role than Clooney, the two top corporate executives, or even Swindon. And so, Wilkinsom does not come off quite convincingly at times; especially during the theatrical exchange with Clooney in a dark alley, with Wilkinson carrying a bag full of baguettes; while watching their angry exchange, it was almost palpable that Wilkinson was no more than an *actor* playing a part, and that you're watching a drama, a movie, rather than real life.This may be partly caused by the movie's screenplay whose awkwardness can be felt at times. There are quite a lot of set pieces in _Michael Clayton_, such as the gamblers' party and their ""tough"" talk; the family birthday-party; the wife of the careless car-driver smashing the glass on the kitchen floor in the beginning...; we have seen similar clichés so many times before in hundreds of other movies that some of the melodramatic gestures abounding in _Michael Clayton_ might almost seem inadvertently comical.",Michael Clayton
221,lucasaq-1,Showcase for Clooney,9,23 October 2007,"Who is Michael Clayton? That is ultimately what this film is about and after watching I am still not entirely sure of his character. What was his motivation? Was it friendship? Was it justice? Was it revenge? I am not entirely sure. All I know is that Michael Clayton is a cleaner, in debt and on his last string. Clooney is Michael Clayton and embodies all these mysteries very well creating a compelling character. The film is mainly about Clooney, but he is surrounded by a strong cast of supporting players in particular Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson both are opposite sides, but fighting the same fight although in entirely different fashions. Swinton is on the side of the company while Wilkinson is on side of the people, although Wilkinson's comes off as a nut job.The film is not told in chronological order either, but starts off almost at the end and then repeats for the conclusion in a classic Hollywood style narrative although the flashbacks is not related in voice over. The film is a bit hard to keep up with a rapid pace of information, but that also makes the film quite satisfying while not completely showing all its cards.Perhaps my favorite aspect of this film is its pacing which is not frantic, but quite mellow for a thriller of sorts only having few scenes of panic which are very well built up. The final car chase is so understated you do not even get it until the end. This is a well made mystery drama thriller and a showcase for Clooney's talent as an actor.",Michael Clayton

I've worked for and with large American corporations and don't subscribe to the liberal belief that they are inherently evil. Don't forget that the bigger you are the more visible you are. That's why politicians and film stars get caught out for adultery, whereas ""normal"" people get away with it. That's why I don't believe that large corporations kill or murder people on purpose. However, this is only a story, and has some great performances,especially from the Brits; - Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton.For me, the flawed premise just makes the story a black fairy tale, with no real meaning.By the way, why wasn't Veronica Cartwright given a credit, or even an IMDb ""uncredit""?",Michael Clayton
223,thebengalimafia-1,One word; brilliant!,10,13 November 2007,"I really didn't know what to expect going in to see this film. I knew it was about a lawyer named Michael Clayton played by George Clooney. But I had some time to kill on a Friday so I walked in and I was blown away.The movie begins with the films climax and then back tracks to everything that had taken place over the course of the previous four days. Some mid-west American farming families have sued a corporate giant named U-North for supposedly selling a pesticide that causes cancer. A senior attorney, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) for the U-North defense suffers a mental breakdown and strips naked in the middle of a deposition. Clayton is sent to Milwaukee to clean up the matter. Clayton has been labeled many things in his career, a fixer, a janitor; Michael Clayton is someone who can take a situation and make it whatever his firm needs it to be. As Clayton attempts to clean this mess up, he is thrown into a puddle of corporate sabotage and deceit that may be too big to handle, even for him.One of the most intriguing things in the screen play is the role of Arthur Edens. As it turns out, Clayton was planning on having Edens admitted in a New York City hospital for psychiatric problems. A strange twist of fate reveals that the only lawyer in the firm who understands criminal law and the mentally ill is Edens himself. And once he gets back to New York, one thing becomes clear; Edens may have had a nervous breakdown, but he is now in full control of his senses. He understands that because he defended U-North, he is a criminal and after meeting some of the people harmed by U-North, he has had a moment of clarity. So Arthur decides to set things right. I won't give away any more plot details; the rest needs to be seen on the big screen.Both George Clooney and Tom Wilkinson have my new found respect. While watching the film, I never thought I was watching George Clooney, sexiest man alive or the worst Batman in history. He was Michael Clayton. He was a fixer, with the picture perfect image of a successful lawyer that does whatever you need him to if the price is right.Director Tony Gilroy is just as impressive. Amidst all the dialogue, he moves back to the visual story telling. There are times in the film where he won't tell the audience, he shows it to them. And a brilliant film like this demands the audience involve themselves and engage the characters. Gilroy uses static camera shots of everything and nothing at the same time. His pacing was never too fast or too slow for me; it was methodical. I think one of the best parts of the film is the pacing. There's tension, there's drama, there's confusion; it was beautiful story telling all the way.I just know that this one is going to clean house come Oscar time next year. This is undoubtedly the best film of 2007!",Michael Clayton
224,The_Matrix_Rocks,Michael Clayton is Over-hyped,5,16 May 2008,"What a bore! The posters outside the theatre said this was Clooney's best work, but I totally disagree.What this is, is a sad, but uninteresting story about big business being primarily motivated by profit - no surprise there.Against this backdrop, we see the story of a aging fringe operator in a formidable legal machine.I have seen far more compelling versions of this same story - ""A Civil Action"" springs to mind, as does ""Erin Brokovich"" (and not just because of the boobs) and even ""The Devil's Advocate"" for heaven's sake (and again, not just because of the boobs).Where ""Michael Clayton"" fails is in the complete absence of drama. I ascribe this to a problem of poor focus and unfortunate choices - the film is unable to decide which story thread to focus on, and lazily tries to tie up this indecision by requiring the viewer to believe that an implausible accident sets in motion an even more implausible sting operation.Much has been made about Clooney's performance, but the only deserved Oscar buzz was that generated for Tilda Swanson's performance.If it's a strong Clooney performance you're after, then rather watch ""Syriana"" again.",Michael Clayton
225,kellyq12,"Lacks suspense, moral dilemma not shown in a compelling way",5,2 January 2008,"I was really disappointed in this movie. It was just okay. I do not agree with the level of critical acclaim is has received. It was a decent (but not great) character study. It lacked any real suspense. It was pretty simple story that tried to appear complex.I think there were great individual acting performances, but I think something was lacking in the relationships between the story's main characters, which made it not compelling enough.One of the biggest reasons for the lack of suspense is that the flash-forward opening killed any possibilities of suspense in the movie's later scenes. The first 10 minutes shows the audience what will happen in the end, which makes a late-in-the-movie ""car chase"" not really a car chase (we know where he's headed!) among other spoiled moments. So instead the end just feels long and drawn out.I am not one who needs a lot of flashy action sequences to keep me interested in a story, so that is not my complaint. But even the psychological suspense was lacking. This movie was a story that showed Michael Clayton caught in the midst of a corrupt situation, and it showed how another character's guilt pulled him into madness. However, the insane character was already insane from the get-go, and Michael Clayton never was faced with a really juicy moral dilemma where BOTH choices are bad. I love movies where as an audience member I question what I'd do because the situation is so precarious. Instead, I was bored, waiting for Michael to get on with what was so obviously coming.A better psychological thriller/character study involving moral dilemma is ""Breach."" I recommend that over ""Michael Clayton"" any day.",Michael Clayton
226,Eightythreeyearoldguy,A Gilroy family affair,9,17 March 2008,"Just a bit of trivia here. Not only was this written and directed by Tony Gilroy but it was edited by his younger brother John and had his son Sam in a quite minor role as a copy boy.This obviously was a winning combination, but of course the movie was also helped considerably by the acting. Tilda Swinton of course was splendid in conveying mixed emotions and certainly deserved her Oscar, but the trio composed Clooney, Wilkinson, and Tilda abetted by Sydney Pollack and Michael O'Keefe totally owned the movie.This would have won more awards in a less competitive year. Be that as it may, this is definitely one of the thinking man's thrillers of the year.",Michael Clayton
227,jemmytee,An elegant work showing a filthy world,10,31 January 2008,"""Michael Clayton"" is the name of the best lawyer in the powerhouse litigation firm of Kenner, Bach, & Ledeen. So good, he's not allowed to waste himself in court; he's used to clean up the messes the firm's rich and powerful clients cause -- and he's damn good at his job. Problem is, it's destroying him from the inside out. At least...it's doing so until he slams headlong into a problem that forces him to see the decay growing within. That problem comes in the form of a brilliant but guilt-ridden attorney named Arthur Edens, whose spectacular meltdown during a deposition has thrown a HUGE class-action suit against a conglomerate called UNorth into turmoil. Michael is sent to get him back under control...or else, thus setting in motion what is, in my mind, one of the most breathtaking suspense dramas I've seen in years.Starting with a tight, stunning script by Tony Gilroy, this movie has every cylinder firing in perfect sync. The acting is, without exception, exceptional. George Clooney takes a vile human being and inhabits him with such sympathy and understanding, he becomes just another man fighting to keep his life going who IS still capable of decency. (The moment where, after Michael's son has seen a beloved uncle who's an addict come groveling for forgiveness, he stops the car and lets the boy know he's stronger than that uncle is so right and so perfect, I nearly wept.) And Tilda Swinton's litigator, Karen Crowder, is so desperate and unsure, you can almost understand why she makes some of the decisions she does. And Tom Wilkinson blazes across the screen as Arthur Edens, who has finally seen the evil within himself and wants to make it right but who, despite all his legal brilliance, is still naive enough to think he can get away with it.The direction is taut, cinematography and editing cool and precise, and all are at the service of an elegant work that uses the suspense genre to illuminate a filthy world that has been glossed over by money and power. Magnificent in every way.",Michael Clayton

This time around, I've revised my view.I don't think it's because I'm a little older (God knows, I am!), but rather that I paid more attention this time. It is a relatively straightforward story, but it's not simply chewing gum for the eyes and does need your focus to get the best from it. I just now reaped the maximum reward from doing just that.I now feel that this is one of the best movies that George has made - and he's made some very good ones (The American, Three Kings, Syriana, Out of Sight, to name but a few). In fact, this may now be one of my all time favourite movies.It's dark, yet very involving. The story-line feels very real and gritty and could even be true.

What is also great is that it keeps you wanting to watch more and more and to find out more you really are thinking where is this movie gonna go? how will it end? what's it even about? but you soon find out and the more you find the more you long to know!

The story has a bad plot and fails terribly in continuity. Just who are the bad guys anyway? There are better movies out there to watch rather than waste your time and money on this one. Example of bad thought out ideas --- Bad guys use a GPS, that does not work correctly and has nothing to do with a car bomb that is triggered with a cell phone --- DUH!!!!! And what will Michael do after this movie??? This actually looks and feels like a TV pilot that was rejected, but they had too much money in it to let it go on the floor. Do not feel too bad if you walk out of the theater after this movie and ask ""What was that all about?"" The movie keeps you waiting for something to happen and then disappoints when it does.

The plot was tight and unpredictable, with none of the gratuitous flab that seems to plague SO many wannabe thrillers.All the performances were right on the money. I particularly enjoyed George Clooney's more complex approach to his role. He can always dust himself off with another ""Ocean's"" installment, but in movies like Syriana, The Good German and this one, he seems to almost relish his character's diminished status. In Michael Clayton, we have an unhappy, financially and morally bankrupt flunky. This is hardly your typical hero. It's got to take some real confidence and talent for someone with Clooney's innate leading charisma to pull this off, and he does.This is definitely not an action movie, it is a thinking person's thriller, rendered pretty much flawlessly by rookie director (but veteran writer) Tony Gilroy.",Michael Clayton

1. Tom Wilkinson delivers a masterful portrait of a high-functioning manic
2. I love how Clooney plays the character. He's a putz, a corporate fixer with nothing to show for his 20+ years as a bagman

234,rightkeith,Just wow. Much Better the Second Time,9,15 November 2017,"I rarely rewatch movies. Especially ones I thought were just OK. I first saw Michael Clayton 10 years ago and thought it was decent, if not a little slow and confusing. I could tell it was intense, but didn't know why. Maybe I was too young to understand that large corporations have their own in-house counsel as well as outside legal consultants when involved with multi-billion dollar cases. so it wasn't until 2nd viewing when I kind of knew what to expect that I was able to appreciate everyone's motivations.There is no hero to be found in Michael Clayton. Nothing is black and white. A bunch of people are mired in gray, and face extraordinary circumstances, and each is looking out for themselves.The director gives the audience a lot of credit here. Nothing is spelled out. At one point Michael is being arrested for breaking into a crime scene; we are not told he has been ratted on, but know who did it. We don't need to be told that the two wine glasses in the refrigerator cement Michael's theory that his colleague was murdered and didn't OD. I wasn't familiar with Tony Gilroy, so was pleasantly surprised seeing his other projects included Rogue One (a rarely complex yet believable script for the Star Wars universe) and Bourne Identity.I enjoyed this so much once I figured it out that it makes me want to go back and give Syriana another shot.",Michael Clayton

Think Three Days of the Condor, which was also about company/Company (CIA) culture and you get my meaning.As a nod to the those 1970s thrillers, we even have the great director Sydney Pollack in the cast, playing one of the firm's senior partners.Clooney portrays a man who is drowning, but has enough humanity left to save himself.Well worth a look, if you like films that take their time, and does not spell everything out to you.Classy!",Michael Clayton

239,shaneo632,"Intelligently-plotted, well-acted, moralistic thriller...",8,27 November 2007,"Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):In recent years, Tony Gilroy has become something of a virtuoso in writing slick, intense, and foremost, smart thrillers. The advertising for his latest outing, ""Michael Clayton"", tells us ""the truth can be adjusted"", and the dichotomy of right and wrong, pitted against what is true and false, is an ever-recurrent theme of the majority of Gilroy's other works (including The Devil's Advocate and the Bourne series).Whilst Jason Bourne veers on the edge of veracity, Clooney's considerably more complex Clayton lands firmly between what he purports to be justifiably distorting the truth (or ""fixing"", as he calls it), and as becomes his test, exposing the truly wicked, dirt sheet cover-ups of his superiors.Michael Clayton opens with what one could easily dismiss as an overly-wordy, mightily confusing, dare I say pretentious monologue, and whilst it initially left a sour taste in my mouth, you'll be laughing at yourself twenty-five minutes later as things begin to unravel. This opening scene very much embodies the essence of the film - it mystifies, and might even disgust you briefly (as it unapologetically references sequences later in the film), but once Gilroy's smoke subsides, the film satisfies in every way a film of this ilk should.From the very outset, Clooney is sure to play his role as calmly and sedately as possible - he even appears to be lacking affect at times, but like the narrative itself, Clooney's titular character is a slow-burner, but when he kicks, he kicks with all the might of a football striker. We learn very quickly that Clayton is a ""fixer"", deftly cleaning up the messes of his law firm's clients, and in this respect you'd think Clayton might be a bit of a scumbag, but Clooney resists cracking the cocksure smile, and enjoys a seemingly loving relationship with his son, so it's hard to dislike the guy, especially once the credits roll. Furthermore, when you compare Clayton with near enough anyone else in this film, he's a veritable angel.Clayton is, like many of us, a slave to the wage - he has his own monetary problems, as well as being divorced, but employs a stiff upper lip that doesn't quite put Gary Cooper to shame, but it's not far off. Furthermore, the fact that Clooney is able to pull this off without appearing emotionally shallow is commendable to say the least - Clayton smoulders under the surface, never quite snapping or exploding, but we're made aware that the sour broth is well and truly simmering.However, as straight-laced as Clooney plays it, he is undoubtedly outfoxed by the brilliant Tom Wilkinson, who plays Clayton's mentally ill colleague with such relentless intensity, such a schooled-tenacity that Clooney's restrained turn-in simply pales in comparison. Wilkinson takes a character that could very well have, given the nature of his crimes, dragged the film down into sheer parody, but he makes the character his own, and quite simply outdoes everyone occupying the screen with him. The fact enough that I have yet to mention Tilda Swinton or Sydney Pollack's roles in this film is a testament to the fact that they are (with no disrespect intended to them), in the greatest sense, entirely ancillary when compared to Wilkinson's attempt.It is at Wilkinson's arrival that the film gains the traction it was so desperately crying out for, as Clayton is charged with keeping his ill colleague in check, and subsequently uncovering his law firm's macabre attempt to win a class-action lawsuit. The film encounters a tonal shift in its second half, transforming from what was simply a smart legal drama to an invariably more intense outing, as Clayton becomes embroiled in a life-and-death battle of wits, his ""way of the pen"" pragmatism being pitted against a rather hefty blade. Clayton faces off against the world, against persons more resourceful and more combative than himself, forcing Clayton to wear his thinking cap and do what he does best - use it to rectify a highly volatile situation.For all of its nail-biting tautness, perhaps the tie-off is a little too neat, and relies on a level of staginess that some viewers will simply scoff at, yet I sympathised with and understood Clayton's motivation so much that I found it largely inconsequent. Coincidence is just one of the many elements abound in the film's closing minutes, yet it isn't so unbelievable as to doom the film entirely, if at all. The final moments end with all the declivity of a Scooby Doo episode, but the rest of this piece is so intelligent and tightly-plotted that one is willing to forgive Gilroy.Michael Clayton won't provide you with the fantastical imagery of The Devil's Advocate, nor serve up the wildly exaggerated thrills-and-spills of the Bourne series, but as far as Gilroy's writing goes, it could be far, far worse. Indeed, it could be Proof of Life, or it could even dare to be Armageddon. What pushes Clayton steps ahead of its potentially rudimentary material is the performances - Clooney is as steely and enjoyable to watch as always, and Wilkinson is simply unforgettable. The written material may not be Oscar-calibre, but Wilkinson's performance just may well be. If you seek an intelligent tale of morality and intrigue, look no further than Michael Clayton.",Michael Clayton
240,phantomtristan,Michael Clayton,10,18 October 2007,"Tony Gilroy (the screenwriter of all three Bourne films) makes his directorial debut with Michael Clayton. It is a true masterpiece that elevates itself from the common lawyer/thriller genre into a classic. George Clooney plays Michael Clayton, a burned out lawyer working for a respected law firm. He does not have a glamorous job. He is in his own words ""a janitor"". He cleans up messes of cases and runs around reassuring clients that their money has been spent wisely. He is also in debt, divorced, and has a gambling addiction. Michael is assigned to fix the situation of a defense lawyer, Arthur Eden (played by Tom Wilkinson), he knows, is arrested for streaking. Arthur has been working six years on a defense for a multi-billion dollar corporation, uNorth. One of Michael's duties include controlling the manic depressant Arthur as well as reassuring a uNorth corporate employee that everything is under control and that uNorth's $9 million worth of legal fees will not go to waste. Michael attempts to reason with Arthur to finish working on the defense, despite Arthur's protests regarding evidence that uNorth's products have and are killing people. One thing, among many, that make this film so good is that it does not rely on conventional thrills with car chases, shootouts, or dramatic courtroom showdowns; but has it's own unique atmospheric intensity to it that pulls you in from the opening sequence. The cast is a major driving force of the film. Every character is so well casted and acted. George Clooney delivers another powerful performance, Tom Wilkinson plays the manic depressant with a passionate vigor, and Tilda Swinton gives an astonishing performance as the corporate member dealing with insecurities but desperately trying to hide and control them.The entire production of the film is so well done. The sharp, sophisticated script is remarkable, and filled with so many great lines. This is a moving, exceptional lawyer film pulsing with a brooding intensity.",Michael Clayton
241,charliecheswick,"Good thriller , but slightly disjointed.",6,14 October 2007,"I quite enjoyed this movie, its a slow mover , but it does eventually get to where its going. George Clooney plays the role of Michael Clayton -a legal firms downtrodden dogs body.While struggling to juggle the many aspects of his life- friends , family , money , and work he becomes involved in the dark underworld of business. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it does not spoon feed its audience the story and characters. At the same time though , this is a flaw in the film as it at times seams clumsy and slightly disjointed. For example we see a few scenes involving Clooney and his family , but not enough is revealed to give the audience an insight into the dynamics of the family. We here that he is an intelligent man , but we don't see him excelling in intelligence. We see him struggling to run is business ,but are not shown enough of this struggle. Etc...etc... As a result of this , by the end of the movie ,you are left with the feeling that you don't know Michael Clayton any better than you did after the first 10 minutes of the film. Overall what makes this film good is the story and performance by the cast, but i was left with the feeling that it could have benefited at times if it had adopted a bit more of a direct ""slap bang"" approach",Michael Clayton
242,Richard-Nathan,"It's great entertainment, but not as intelligent as it pretends to be",5,14 October 2007,"SPOILER ALERT This is a very entertaining film - and entirely enjoyable while you're watching it - but the plot really does not make a lot of sense if you give it close scrutiny. SPOILERS AHEAD - While the document that Clayton finds is certainly damaging evidence, given the facts of this case, the plaintiffs should have been able to win it without that document. If the defendants wanted to hush things up, I don't think a car bomb would be the way to go. There are a number of ways the bad guys could have killed someone and at least made an attempt for it to look like an accident. Finally, the woman in charge of the law firm was not the type of take charge, confident, shark-type she would need to be to rise to that position. Yes, MICHAEL CLAYTON is a very entertaining firm to watch - but the ""logic"" falls apart if you think about it afterward.",Michael Clayton
243,dishmanl,Intelligent entertainment not to be missed!,8,16 October 2007,"Anyone ignoring evolution will be hard pressed to explain the talent of George Clooney. Perhaps they should at least look at the progression of his career. Either way, another film arrives to convince any skeptics that Clooney can pick, support and shine in good projects.Michael Clayton is the product of screenwriter Tony Gilroy, most recently famous for the Bourne movie adaptations. Gilroy has created a group of compellingly watchable, flawed characters. He added spicy quirks, corporate intrigues, questionable motives and enough tangles to match Gideon's knot. Audiences are challenged without feeling overwhelmed. The story is worth every twist and turn. Gilroy also directed with a very effective, sure, delicate touch. What is more remarkable is that Gilroy has never directed a film - natural talent here.Producer-director Sidney Pollack acts here as head of Clayton's huge law firm. Tom Wilkinson is the firm's special counsel defending a huge agribusiness conglomerate in a long gestating class action lawsuit, but his sanity is vanishing. The conglomerate is headed by Ken Howard and corporate counsel Tilda Swinton. Add family, coworkers and mix well. Additionally, Tilda Swinton's acting could be a class study in subtlety - this is definitely Oscar territory. Every performance is the top of its game, all led by George Clooney as the law firm's Mr. Fixit.OK, I'm a nut for well-produced, appropriate soundtracks and James Newton Howard delivers, supporting the film with compelling but never intrusive melodies.Michael Clayton's settings, photography and editing are nearly flawless.Michael Clayton answers any studio cynic who insists that only mindless filmed leftovers, sequels and remakes can reach audiences. This film filled half the auditorium at an early Sunday screening in North Texas - another remarkable achievement.",Michael Clayton
244,jacob-l-williams,Pretty standard thriller... but why did George go the horses?,6,8 June 2010,"Michael Clayton is a dark tense thriller movie about Michael Clayton (played by George Clooney) a law firms 'fixer' and how he slowly uncovers the corrupt business behind it.The film is well made, written and acted, the plot has some interesting twists, however when watching it all felt kind of dull to me. I could see as I watched it that the acting was good and that the director was doing everything right to create the tension and confusion which he was obviously aiming for and yet I never really connected to the characters or the story-line.The film started off well and shows Clooney going about his job before getting upset driving into the country and then for no apparent reason pulling over and going up to some horses in a field, his car then explodes and the narrative takes a flash-back four days, as the filmmaker then tells us how Clooney got to where he is. However when the narrative reaches the point where Clooney is once again in the field, it is not explained why he gets out of the car and goes to see the horses and that really annoyed me. Any other day Clooney's character would have died and I just felt like the director of the film was trying to think up a reason for Clooney to leave his car and then looked out of the window saw some horses and was like 'yeah they'll do'Michael Clayton then is a film which I did enjoy at parts but which failed to make an impact and annoyed me when a key plot point was left unexplained. This movie has all everything a great film should have and yet somehow doesn't reach greatness which is something I am rather disappointed about.6/10",Michael Clayton
245,Kroshe,Recommended 8/10,8,29 February 2008,"Michael Clayton is a character driven film, something our tiny attention span society seems unable to cope with.The director wrote the fast-paced Bourne trilogy, and this movie is just as tightly-scripted and hair-trigger tense, but the pace is more considered and less rushed. Much of the action goes on internally, so don't expect great car chases, shouting and shooting. You have to think about what's going on and follow Clayton's emotional response to the situation that blows up in his face.Movie has some really fine performances from Tom Wilkinson as an attack lawyer, a partner in the law firm where Clayton works and Tilda Swinton is utterly superb as the bad bitch. She's a grim, ambitious litigator who will stop at absolutely nothing to avoid losing her company's case. She's so highly strung she almost shatters; there's a stunning scene with her in the rest rooms, nearly coming apart at the seams under huge stress.Without a doubt, the star is Clooney and he carries the film superbly. There are many beautiful and carefully composed shots and it all comes together in an entirely satisfactory and fulfilling resolution.Recommended 8/10",Michael Clayton
246,nimstic,Terrfic writing - thrilling from start to finish,8,14 April 2018,"Came here to write a review to this excellent film. Wonderfully written by Tony Gilroy. I have not seen any of his earlier/or later works except Duplicity, which to me was a pretty average film. Everyone in MC are top of the line pros - Tilda Swindon, Tom Wilkinson, Sidney Pollack and George Clooney, doing what he does best. The story is cleverly written, adapted in a tight and flawless manner. Surprised by the lower rating here. For me a good 8/10. Yes, it has an interesting ending but that doesn't do justice to the excellent journey the film takes you on from start to finish. If you enjoy edgy, legal thrillers, get yourself going with it. I've watched after an article on Atlantic describing it as a treatise on human soul's intense cry for help today. We all want something about this world to desperately change but we see it turning against us with more intensity the more we think about it.",Michael Clayton
247,toddbradley,"great acting, good film",7,24 December 2007,"I saw this film on Christmas eve day, and was surprised there were so few people in the theater. Chicks dig Clooney, of course. But this movie takes a lot of mental engagement by the viewer. Clooney, Wilkinson, and Pollack give outstanding performances in this one. And Swinton's great, too. The story is believable and intricate, and has a couple really good plot twists. Even the final major scene left me wondering right up to the very end.The story line in this film is actually a number of different threads, somewhat interwoven, all helping to show different aspects of Michael Clayton. It really works well, I think. As another reviewer pointed out, the film really is about the character. Yeah, there's a dramatic mystery, but we really get a 360 degree view of Clooney's Clayton, more than most similar films.Finally, I disagree with those reviewers who wrote about the impenetrable legal dialog. The legal stuff doesn't really get in the way at all. I'm not a big fan of legal dramas, so I don't know the lingo, but I didn't feel that any of the story was over my head.",Michael Clayton
248,davetex,A bit of a disappointment,6,26 February 2008,"This is a film for the die-hard Clooney/Soderbergh fans, its a typical vehicle for these guys, full of George looking preoccupied and full of angst (but still clean shaven and his hair is always perfect) while the atmosphere drips with the corruption and hypocrisy of corporate types and people try to kill him. Etc etc. Yawn. Its Syriana without Arabs.Any lawyer will tell you that the idea that a law firm would employ a special someone to go around ""fixing"" the odd shady deal is complete horse feathers. All lawyers are equipped to do that, you don't need a specialist. And the idea that a lawyer would jump ship to go work for the other side in a law suit is also not happening. Firstly, you aren't allowed to do that. Secondly, no one is changing clients when you already have the one with the most money.And if George is so good at keeping things under control, why can't he control his own relationship with the law firm? Why has he been getting shafted for all these years by these guys? Not so smart and tough after all, I guess.From a structural point of view, the movie jumps around which is confusing and adds nothing in my opinion. But it does distract you from the fact that the whole thing is formulaic and doesn't make a lot of sense.And why did he stop to talk to the horses anyway? Is that the best they could come up with to avoid his car troubles? Overrated film in my view. Best picture material? Hardly.Go watch the verdict with Paul Newman or even Erin Brokovich for the better play on these issues.",Michael Clayton
249,ravensteals,Its an alright Movie..... but Nothing NEW!,1,9 June 2008,"Sometimes it seems Hollywood are a little short of Ideas (or perhaps it seems that way Mostly) because this is nothing new... there is nothing to keep you on the edge your seat... panting for more... in fact it gives you a bit of neck ache after a while, while you are wondering if it's going anywhere... George is smooth and suave as always... looks great inna suit... nice salt an pepper immaculate hair... nice watch... but so? so what? There's only one good thing about this movie, the ending! Why? Coz ITS OVER - THATS WHY! :)) I don't mean to be rude George, but really, can't you read the script a little more carefully next time?! Perhaps make them add some interesting bits! OK OK OK ... it does have its good points - but there are so many movies BETTER THAN THIS ONE! Its a little long and boring for my liking (obviously)! Seems a lot of people like it, or do they vote without actually watching the Movie they are voting for? Hmmmmmmmm... I would say; its not the worst movie in the world! S'not the Best Neither!

250,correcamino,The language of success,8,24 February 2008,"All one has to do is take a look at the actor/actress listings  and the insane pace at which they are working  on this Web site to understand finally that movies are simply a reflection of the society they were made in. Tilda Swinton's listing is Kathy Crowder's day book.Most characters are also personifications of producer personalities. In this case, with only one or two exceptions, that is not such a bad thing. The two worlds' reflections of each other is particularly apt.My first time through watching the film I thought, 'wow, this really is the year (or year and a half) of the villainous woman.' First Jody Foster in The Inside Man and now Tilda Swinton in Michael Clayton. But then I thought, nah, it's just their turn. (Although most of this year's Oscar nominated films are almost exclusively male.)Is violence a natural extension of business?In so many ways, this was an excellent film. In no way, though, did it approach perfection. The flaws are obvious: the lack of depth to the Clayton family characters, all of whom were very interesting. There simply was not enough time. Second, without a body, I am not so sure Michael Clayton's death would be believed as widely as it was.This film really should be a series, like the Bourne franchise. It was not substantive enough to stand on its own. It has that series feel to it.George Clooney was good, but especially brilliant was Tom Wilkinson. Everyone was great. The pace was excellent, emphasizing how important time is to the characters and how quickly annoyed they/we get when we even approach a waste of it. Everything is all about getting down to business. Hurry up and cut out the extraneous crap. Again, same thing in the director's commentary on the DVD. Movie-making then is a projection of process onto whatever subject one is making a film about. George Clooney's character is a ""janitor"" or a ""fixer,"" his real life role to the beleaguered director who's been trying to get his film made for six years is that of a ""godfather"" or ""kingmaker."" Same thing. Hurry up and get from point a to point b and use this or that person to get you there. The language of ""success.""Interesting but not as interesting as we used to be.",Michael Clayton
251,ruthierocks,Uneven thriller with few highlights.,5,16 October 2008,"Michael Clayton was, overall, a pretty big disappointment to me. It starts off relatively strong with some very interesting exposition. However, by the middle, it became a bit muddled and off course. Instead of relying on characterization, which it could have easily done, the film focuses on twists that have been seen before and an under use of some serious acting talent.Without giving too much away, I'll say that this more a story of ethics than other typical lawyer movies. In this respect, Michael Clayton offers a fresh perspective. That's about as far as the creative aspects go. George Clooney plays a forty-five year old ""miracle worker"" lawyer named Michael Clayton. Michael is a lawyer known for cleaning up messes. He even refers to himself and others as ""janitors"" rather than lawyers. At the beginning, Michael is bailing his colleague, Arthur, out of jail for indecent exposure. Arthur, once a renowned lawyer, has become guilt stricken and obsessed with a case and one of its plaintiffs. The case involves the death and poisoning of a substantial amount of people due to a weed killer. The lawsuit is against an agricultural company, U North, whose legal counsel is the brilliant Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton). Things go awry quickly and the struggle for power and money seem to head up the actions of these underdeveloped characters.The main problem I had with this film was the fact that it tried way too hard to shove in several subplots that the film could have easily done without. These side stories weakened the film and, without them, the intensity of the plot could have easily been increased. Michael Clayton was a cool guy, but the scenes involving his son and brother were completely unnecessary. One could argue that these scenes characterized Michael, but I'd disagree. The scenes, especially the ones with his son, were of no real use to the film.As far as acting goes, the cast here is top notch. Clooney turned in, arguably, the least stunning performance. Michael Clayton failed to make an impression on me as a character until the last few minutes of the film. I'm not saying that George Clooney was bad, but nothing about his portrayal made the character memorable or interesting. He redeems himself slightly in the last few scenes, showing more emotion there than throughout the whole thing. Tilda Swinton is a great actress and did well with the material she was given. The problem was that the material she was given is very limited. The film could have done something great with her character, but instead just left it kind of in the air. We see her practicing a speech before she gives it, showing a more vulnerable, less confident side than she actually shows when speaking in public. But the characterization ends there, leaving the viewer with no one to really care about or be interested in. I'm of the opinion that the best performance of the film was that of Tom Wilkinson as the guilt-ridden Arthur. Wilkinson manages to steal every scene he's a part of. It's a shame that he did not receive more screen time.Perhaps I built it up too much, given the good reviews and Oscar nominations, but I fail to see how Michael Clayton is anything more than a typical legal film that tries too hard to be an edgy thriller. It's watchable, but rather mediocre and dull. Aside from some decent supporting performances and a pretty decent ending, Michael Clayton is nothing to get excited about.6/10",Michael Clayton
252,foxface,Intelligent Thriller,7,27 November 2009,"Michael Clayton is a great film because the script was so well written. The suspense is not action driven, but character driven, due to Michael Clayton (George Clooney) being the glue or arch angel that holds the company together, while being marginalized as the invisible man. Michael's gift is the ability to fix problems, even when he can't manage his own gambling addiction, divorce, and mounting debts. He is not unlike many people watching this movie. Tilda Swinton's character is almost his twin sister, she is fixing up the problem, solving the problem(unethically through murder) so that her law firm can do well. However, the audience can see that (like Michael) her job is all she has in her life and that she is an obsessive compulsive person (laying out her stockings one by one, nitpicking cloth off the bed spread, practicing her speech). Yet, she wants to present a face of perfect control in a male dominated culture (by presenting herself as sexless or asexual-you forget she is a woman).This is an adult film with real adult relationships and the problems that arise from those relationships. The characters are people who are left to control situations that are out of their control. This is a film about greed over humanity, right against wrong. Arthur (almost like Arthur of the knights of the round table) is the one person who try to preserve the truth (holy grail) and despite his insanity, is the person who believes in the law and wants to practice it openly and honestly. You see his brilliance as a lawyer during the confrontation in the alley with Michael Clayton. Once Arthur is dead, you also the marginalization of his existence as a human being (which happens to the dead in real life) by the lawyer constantly on the phone at a wake, the business deal having to take place, despite a death a partner at the firm.The ""action"" in this movie is demonstrated through the acts of the characters. Except from the car blowing up and speeding on the highway, there is no real ""action"" in the traditional sense of the word. Despite this, the director and the script do a good job of keeping your audience interest. All of the actors were brilliant and looked world weary, which was appropriate for the film. The cinematography on this film was excellent, a lot of gray in the background (skies, houses, asphalt, buildings, etc).The horse scene for me represents a couple of things. The horse scene is a bridge from the 1st act of the film to the second act-which is the consequences of everyone's actions coming into play. It also serves as the death of the old way of life for Michael Clayton to the new way of life he will lead once everything is resolved. So the car blowing up is literally a car blowing up and metaphorically the end of Michael's old way of life. The horses were pure and in a natural state, nothing was manipulated about them, which drives Michael to get out of the car and look at them. The horses also look at Michael as if they recognize and see in him what he sees in them (purity, integrity, honesty). Up until that point, Michael thought he lost that aspect of himself.All in all a good movie, which is why Tilda Swinton probably won the Oscar. Too bad nobody else was recognized for their work.",Michael Clayton
253,alan.hughes,Unfortunately missing the mark,4,6 July 2008,"There is no doubt a lot of talent behind this film. There is good acting, good direction and at times good dialogue. The script is worthy and involves interesting themes of corruption, guilt and redemption. The big names involved and the trailer will mean a large audience is secured.However, I feel it ultimately misses the mark. It is not its plodding slowness, nor is it the padding (which trying to be portentous becomes only pretentious), nor is it even the cold, grimy mire that envelopes everything. It is the failure to have any passion or any character that is worth a damn. All are damned from the start and we don't really care.",Michael Clayton
254,creeda1,certainly not thrilling!,3,28 October 2008,"I had so been looking forward to seeing this and actually bought the DVD. It may pass as a thriller if you have been living under a coconut tree for the past 40 years, without benefit of television, radio or newspapers. Shock Horror! Lawyers will act for parties they know or suppose are guilty!! Money is more important to them than ethics!! The film starts with a voice-off of what sounds like a very annoying drunk rambling on about some dream-like experience. Mercifully, he is killed off relatively soon - he is a lawyer who has seen the light and realises that the gigantic corporation he is acting for in a class action is indeed guilty of the deaths of many people (was it fertiliser or weed-killer? something like that). There is another lawyer played y Tilda Swinton who is very nervy and bony faced - we see her practicing her speeches at home and pretending to be relaxed. This would be more effective if in fact the woman did not look like a ball of nerves (those gaunt cheekbones and staring eyes - not to mention the rather grubby hair!). George Clooney is the good guy - a friend of the rambling first lawyer and saves the day in the end - but not without having his car blown up. There is a very interesting vignette of the domestic life of the New York middle classes: a particularly tedious little boy (about 7 years old) arrives for breakfast shouting to know where his ""cards"" are (what these are we never find out). No nonsense about saying ""good morning mum, dad and little sister"" - just peremptory requests for his cards. The mother seems quite helpless and reacts like a servant who is about to be fired for incompetence. If this is true to life, it might explain why children are so very badly brought-up. If the drunken/drugged out lawyer had ever been shown to us as a normal, pleasant, fellow, we could empathise - as it was I was delighted when he disappeared (I must confess I did not witness this, having left the room to make tea and do the washing up!). The best actor was Syndey Pollack and the bay horse that our hero gazes at - it would be too tedious to explain when and why. Anyway - a complete waste of time ............and money",Michael Clayton
255,julioecolon,Bang for Your Buck,10,24 January 2008,"There is a quiet energy about the film, Michael Clayton, that serves to heighten our growing sense of the evil, predatory practices of UNorth, a New York law firm specializing in litigation, where the eponymous lead character is employed as a niche attorney who cleans up legal snafus. For the past six years, UNorth has been battling a no-holds barred class action lawsuit by plaintiffs who suffered contamination or death from a pesticide manufactured at a company whose president is also a UNorth shareholder. Just as the UNorth team are on the point of prevailing in their counter-suit, in which they claim that no lab evidence contraindicated use of the pesticide at the time it was marketed, their lead attorney discovers a company document, long suppressed: it is a detailed laboratory analysis of the pesticide, conducted before the pesticide's dangers became public knowledge. Its authors concluded that the chemical substance would likely cause tissue damage if ingested even in minute quantities. Worse yet, the document bears the signature of its company's president. The problems escalate from there: the lead attorney's mental state begins to unravel just as UNorth is on the point of clinching an important merger that will make it a world leader in legal affairs. Michael Clayton is called in to staunch the flow. By so doing, he places himself at the center of a dangerous and deadly game. Tony Gilroy's direction is deftly handled, and it's not hard to imagine his conceiving beforehand of the tone and quality of this film as something imbued with a beautiful, diaphanous light throughout. But, it's especially the quiet calmness he must have urged on his actors that is the most notable and successful and which adds a special quality to this film that sets it apart from the typical thriller by staging even the most murderous plotting in the context of the uneventful quotidian, with the morning light filtering down. George Clooney is especially good in the guise of the divorced, burned-out ex-cop turned burned- out lawyer, who is now a financially over-extended gambling addict, and he delivers his lines with a remarkably quiet, steely reserve. Tilda Swinton delivers a carefully nuanced role as a lawyer of modest background, unremarkable educational pedigree, and average looks, who has now risen to great heights despite these impediments and thanks to her unbridled, immoral ambitions, but who is nonetheless never quite able to shake herself of the belief that getting your dowdy business clothes ready the night before, rehearsing your lines, and disposing permanently of human obstacles are three sure-fire ways to succeed. One has a sense of the many backs, including those of her lower-class family, that she stepped on to get to the position she has now attained and, if nothing else, her role should serve as a warning to all the young bucks out there now contemplating careers as attorneys and salivating at the financial gains they stand to make. I am less happy with Tom Wilkinson's performance as the lead attorney on the brink of insanity. His delivery is just a little too over the top and thus irritating. Had he toned down the King Lear-like ravings just a bit, his delivery would have aligned itself more productively with the quiet deliveries of the other actors and made of this film the perfect thriller. Although I'm no George Clooney fan, this is a film worth watching.",Michael Clayton
256,johnclark-1,"Beginnings, Middles, and Endings",3,29 January 2008,"It's next day, and this first-time viewer can only articulate a baffling impression, rather than an analysis, of this movie-going experience and this current tendency when making movies. Michael Clayton, executive produced and starring George Clooney, and produced by and co-starring Sydney Pollack, has an interesting plot and interesting characters, but it falls victim to what one can only assume is today's approach, which is dispense with clear exposition, and launch instead in the middle of the story with important but garbled narrative information against a background of unrelated scenery. Obscurity seems and seemed to be the intent until the end, which at last dealt with dramatic clarity. The audience was able to get up and go out with the feeling that they had witnessed an exciting yarn and are content to forget that they had spent most of the movie trying to guess what was going on.Oh I get it now, that same audience, if they really want to know, will be forced to take the holistic view, and attend the movie at least 2 more times to figure it all out (who did exactly what to exactly who exactly when), and incidentally increase ticket sales threefold.

258,malcolmi,"It must stand the test of time. And, Michael, the time is now!",10,29 March 2020,"While reading many of the reviews written over the past thirteen years, I was struck by how many people have dismissed this film because they couldn't follow Tony Gilroy's expert construction of character and plot. I felt the need to write about the plot and casting of what I feel is another of George Clooney's expertly constructed and expertly performed films.
Michael Clayton's son Henry (Austin Williams) is playing a computer game whose landscape - in which everyone has hidden enemies and loyalties are impossible, is a perfect metaphor for the world of Clayton's law firm, currently earning $9M in fees defending a chemical firm in a case that the head of the firm acknowledges ""reeked from the very start"". Clayton himself is a 'janitor' for the firm, expert at cleaning up the messes his colleagues can't handle, but after 17 years he's not a partner; his firm keeps him at arm's length so that they can disavow all knowledge of his interventions. He's the son of a policeman, and a brother of a detective, from both of whom he derived a sense of responsibility that tugs at his conscience every time he applies the grease that lubricates a tricky situation for the firm. Now, he has to help the senior firm lawyer, Arthur
Edens (Tom Wilkinson), who's in charge of defending the chemical firm, when Edens succumbs to his own fit of conscience. Trying to call Clayton in the midst of a guilt-ridden moment, Edens ends up speaking to Clayton's son, learns of the computer game, Realm and Conquest, and of its amoral landscape, and realises what he must do about his years-long defense of a guilty corporation. The corporation's chief legal officer, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) a fast-tracked executive who owes her allegiance to her mentor, the corporation's CEO, knows that her own career hangs upon a quick resolution to the problem caused by Edens's fit of conscience. She calls a a Mr Verne (Robert Prescott), another 'janitor' recommended by her mentor, to monitor and solve the problem. The story unfolds over a span of four days, and at the end Clayton's conscience, and his willingness to act on it, has brought a temporary resolution to the court case, as well as to aspects of his own family's life. He's still alone, though, cruising in the back seat of a Manhattan cab on $50 worth of time, wondering about the future. It's a tight, grim plot, entirely plausible in the modern world of corporate ruthlessness and self-serving legal manipulation,
Gilroy's superb script contains so many clever nuances of behaviour and motivation that I don't think they can be grasped fully in a single viewing. The framework of Clayton's weakness - gambling at cards and business because he wants some 'walking-away money - which might well have led to his divorce from Henry's mother - is grounded in his yearning to be a courtroom lawyer again, on the frontline of justice. But his firm's principal,Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) tells him ""a lot of guys are good at that. At what you do, you're great!"" That means he'll have to stay where he is, helping get clients out of jams, whether or not they're guilty. He'll never be a partner, and his debts won't be paid. If he tries to get a $75,000 loan from the firm to pay off the loansharks he's indebted to, he'll be suspected of trying to blackmail the firm. There's no apparent way out for Michael Clayton. The consequences of unleashing a security team against Arthur Edens and Michael Clayton become ever guilt-inducing for Karen Crowder, and her tightrope walk between the threats presented by Edens's actions and the security of her position with the corporation's CEO and Board is increasingly tense. The addiction-fuelled decline of Clayton's younger brother Tim (David Landsbury) is at the centre of a family crisis that Clayton's actions help to mitigate by film's end, and the reminder of his brother's weaknesses makes Clayton address his son Henry with words that clarify his own yearning, and his own values. . .""on his strongest day, your Uncle Timmy was never as strong as you . . . you don't need to worry. . . You won't be one of those guys. . "" It's a beautiful and moving moment in the film, capturing an intensity of hope that every father has for his young son.
The casting of this film is masterful. Sean Cullen as Gene Clayton is the perfect elder brother, a detective following in their father's footsteps who has remained outside Michael's Manhattan world. Dennis O'Hare is spectacularly good in a cameo as an executive whose weasel behaviour focusses Clayton's self-loathing. Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson are both superb, and it's unjust that Wilkinson received no awards for his performance. The other cast members who create Clayton's family bring to life a world that he's left behind, but which is more stable and sustaining than the world of his law firm. And Jennifer Ehle and Skip Sudduth apply their superlative craft playing lawyers in deleted scenes which I feel should be re-inserted into the film. Finally, I salute the nuanced performance of George Clooney. One brilliant moment - the look on Michael Clayton's face as Dennis O'Hare's businessman wonders ""what if (his Jaguar sedan) had been stolen"" so that he wouldn't be charged for a hit-and-run. The contempt and loathing, both for 0'Hare's character and for himself as an accomplice, flicker across Clooney's eyes and mouth in a long instant as he watches his client Then his eyes and voice go dead as he tells O'Hare ""There's no velvet chain, no champagne room. . . "" - no dodging the consequences, in other words. It's one of many high points in this breathtaking performance, by an actor at the peak of his craft.
What must one do in an increasingly amoral world? That's a key question for artists to explore. The answer, as presented in Michael Clayton, is clear and unambiguous. The skill with which it's presented is the mark of a brilliant motion picture.",Michael Clayton
259,nycmec,Well Crafted,7,29 October 2007,"This is a very good film. The plot is tight, focusing mostly on the suspense-at-hand. The secondary plot elements relating to Michael Clayton's family are brought in neatly at the end, and help to flesh out Clooney's character. The director Tony Gilroy maintains a level of suspense throughout--largely by opening the movie as a framed narrative with a flashback, which leads us through the events that cause the film to end the way it does.The most extraordinary thing about the film are the performances. Tilda Swinton as the corporate lawyer wandering further and further away from any sense of moral decency as she rehearses her doublespeak. Tom Wilkinson embodying the maybe-I'm-crazy-or-maybe-the-world-is-crazy character who finally breaks free from the corporate veneer. George Cloony keeping his character's morals tightly under wraps so that we're not sure which side he is on until the very end. And Sydney Pollack's pitch-perfect chief of a law firm. They are all helped by a literate, well-crafted script, also by Gilroy.While this film really doesn't do anything new--it tells a fairly staple Hollywood story of corporate greed and maverick insider whistle-blower--it is an extremely pleasurable version of that story.",Michael Clayton
260,desire_911,Excellent Thriller,9,4 March 2008,"I just fall in love with this movie, I didn't see a Thriller like this for long time, this movie is really good, I think George Clooney did a terrific job, so as the cost .This legal thriller was a pleasant surprise. I always expect to enjoy George Clooney's presence in a film. In this case, Clooney's excellent work is in evidence, but also watch for an Oscar-worthy turn from Tom Wilkinson, and a powerful, edgy performance by Tilda Swinton.Michael Clayton is perfectly paced, and complex without being confusing. The director, Tony Gilroy, chooses lingering and steady shots over in the jumbled, shaky hand-held style that is currently so in vogue -- and his choice works well as the tension and drama build to a climactic, and terrific, final act.In my opinion, if George Clooney keeps himself in the right direction he will definitely take another Oscar.Entertainment: 9.7/10Overall Score: 9.5/10",Michael Clayton

I've never been a fan of movies revolving around lawyers, but I do enjoy movies about solving cases and exposing. So, the two elements mixed promise fun. The movie is not in any moment dull and there's always something new that occurs which sometimes seems as if you're watching a real thriller. The acting raised the bar in this movie. It was believable and showing a large range of emotions through witty dialogue.

262,mscherlen,Like watching a glacier melt...,5,15 October 2007,"Michael Clayton is like a throwback to the days when movies actually had a story instead of just explosions and computer graphics, and that is a really good thing. It featured solid acting from Tom Wilkinson and George Clooney and should have been the kind of movie I have been waiting for. But then, they had to blow it with a bunch of inane talk, without all of the filler contributing to our like or dislike of the characters. Sure they told us Clooney's character was a father and sort of had problems, but so what? Didn't make me care any more then when I started. The guy is supposed to be a brilliant ""cleaner"", but continues blindly through the movie. The bad guys can efficiently ""remove"" one problem, but when it comes to Clooney's character, they use the ""let's find the most inane, sophomoric solution we can find"" solution. The end relies on the stupidity of supposedly smart people. I could have given the movie a 9 for being different if the plot vehicles weren't so ridiculous. They must have run against a deadline to hurriedly finish this one.",Michael Clayton
263,Tom-But,A more than able fable for the thinking adrenaline-junkie,10,7 September 2010,"Screenwriter Tony Gilroy (the Bourne series) has found, in Michael Clayton, his niche, having penned a brave and gripping script which demonstrates absolutely no signs of hesitance in its objective not so much to form a new strand of conspiracy thrillers, but to build on from previous films of this nature and take them further, to more exciting and, at times, more contemporary grounds.In his directorial debut Gilroy also brings something new to this genre: his action-oriented style, fast pacing and sharp angles allows Clayton to play like a documentary but with heart, so to speak. Gilroy's gift as a director lies in his ability to allow the elements of drama and action to coexist without doting too much on one and neglecting the other, either causing the film to become dull or too unbelievable.The plot, is simple enough; succinctly: big law firm (Kenner, Bach & Odeen) represents big company (U-North) in big class action law suit (toxic chemicals suspected in products); big lawyer (Arthur Edens) in big law firm has psychotic episode and turns against big company; big company has him killed; lawyer friend (Michael Clayton) of big lawyer also in big law firm ultimately exposes big company. OK? OK.One of the most critically acclaimed aspects of Michael Clayton is, for good reason, the astounding performances which are in some cases career highlights and in others career bests, referring to British thespian Tilda Swinton, who received an Oscar for her portrayal of Karen Crowder, a superficial and ice-cold high class general counsel for U-North who seems motivated by perfection and the need to erase imperfections. While other performances in Clayton are more thunderous and resounding with far more screen time and memorable lines, Swinton as an actress is significant in her ability to play less dialog to her advantage. She uses her incredible gift for realism in her conveyance of self-loathing when practicing her answers obsessively for a press interview, her subtle shielding of angst when in discussion with her ""assistants"" (the very courteous hit men she hires to kill Arthur and attempt the same on Michael) and her rigid professionalism in the company of colleagues and other business associates. The most glorious scene, for Swinton and perhaps for the viewer, is when Crowder is defeated by Michael Clayton, and is left standing speechless, her eyes swimming in confusion, her entire face convulsing in panic; she doesn't faint, but she simply falls to one knee and stares at the floor. She's been beaten, she knows it, she has no control she is utterly helpless.The enthusiastic portrayal of Arthur Edens, a brilliant case attorney with impeccable knowledge of the law who is medicated for his manic- depression, by the versatile Tom Wilkinson is blessed with the actor's knack for sincerity and confidence. When the film is opened by Arthur recalling his dramatic revelatory experience in which he was finally able to view his true role in the world as an accessory to furthering misery as part of a mass organism (the firm Kenner, Bach & Odeen) that excretes loads of injustice upon the world, the viewer is instantly absorbed by this monologue, all the while completely oblivious of what any of it actually means in the grand scheme of the film. It is quite something when you can find the right script that begins by ranting about nothing and the right actor who can, quite professionally, rant about anything to make such a daring opening successful. The remainder of Wilkinson's dialog consists of further ramblings or conversations with Michael in which he is half-aware of himself, but Wilkinson is earnestly at his highest form in his nonverbal sequences, such as his mystical, childlike experience of walking through the late-night downtown streets of Wisconsin, unmedicated, seeing and feeling the real word, the true world again for the first time. These moments are priceless and strong advocators for Wilkinson's continued brilliance in film. The audience feels general sorrow to see this man killed for his honourable intentions of exposing U-North.George Clooney's performance as the eponymous Clayton is not necessarily appealing (or not initially at least), but very intriguing in his stoic approach, with a convincing demeanour that persuades the viewer that someone this good-looking really could have the misfortune for such a sh*tty job (and life, to a lesser extent). Most of the time, the viewer feels that, one way or another, he's thinking and feeling something completely different to what his words express and what his actions entail, but conceals it almost entirely throughout the film, bar one exposing phone message to Arthur and the final confrontation with Crowder. He hides his conscience (the metaphorical presence of which is Arthur) with good intentions, succumbing to his blinding obedience (presented by the legendary actor/director Sydney Pollack's final performance as Marty Bach) and indifferent immorality (Karen Crowder), allowing for corruption and evil actions to prevail. The audience doesn't know if they should pity him for his predicament and good will or condemn him for his ignorance and lack of ethics. By the end of the film, however, the decision has been made for them when Michael's righteousness awakens, fueled by the anger of the murder of his associate and friend, Arthur, at the hands of U-North.The true brilliance of Michael Clayton is in its surprisingly unpredictable conclusion and the heavy tension that lies therein. Right up until the end of the film no one is quite sure of his ultimate intentions, whether his interests lie in money or morality, but all are relieved by his inevitable ascension to do good, to walk away from the substantial offer, leaving Karen dumbstruck and her company's reputation in shambles. The audience is happy to watch this happen, even with the silent daunting knowledge that no real victory has been achieved.",Michael Clayton

266,tapswedar,Michael Clayton,7,29 February 2008,I recently got a chance to see Michael Clayton and i've got to say i was a pretty good movie. The movie has a lot to say and it has a great ending. The thing i did not understand is how this was a heavily nominated movie. This is not George clooney's best performance and the movie to movie does not warrant a best picture nomination. Tom Wilkinson is spectacular on the other hand. This is one of his finest performances in a great career. All in all i thought the movie was very well made and the story was quite worthy. Tony gilroy takes a movie that does not have any heart racing moments and manages to keep your interest. Good movie but i would not say Great.,Michael Clayton
267,albert-wayne,Virtuoso Filmaking,10,13 March 2008,"This film is a great throw back to the wonderful political thrillers of the 70s, I had wonderful flashbacks of movies like The Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor, All the Presidents Men, and Network, yeah, that's right, now, any real film connoisseur should now that Michael Clayton means business when I compare it to a masterpiece like Network.Tony Gilroy (the aphrodisiac in Ocean's Thirteen, hahaha!!!!), whose credits include the screenplay of The Devil's Advocate and the Bourne Series with Matt Damon, he created a very clever, politically oriented screenplay, with highly articulate dialogs, and a very provocative subject matter handled with a very realistic undertone of a subtle political thriller. There's really no doubt as to why the likes of Steven Soderbergh, Anthony Minghella, George Clooney and Sydney Pollack got interested in such project.Gilroy, who also directed, was truly inspirational with Michael Clayton, and personally speaking, handled a potentially difficult subject matter that has been seen before with a different perspective and undertone which made the movie very interesting from the start. Many people have complained about the movie, that it's slow, boring, and whatnot. My only response is, well, it's a serious movie, I seldom laughed, maybe once or twice, that's true, and the film is loaded with dialog, however, who ever said that an intentionally serious film, with clever dialog was bad. I could see the ""no laughing"" matter to be a problem in a movie like Juno, an intended comedy with no laughs is terrible, but Michael Clayton is not Juno, Michael Clayton has a different purpose, and shame on the people who complaint, not for disliking what Gilroy did, but for not appreciating what he was trying to do, and what he, in my mind, achieved very successfully.The movie requires intense attention to detail, you must be alert, cause missing anything on Michael Clayton is critical, and even when paying attention, some of the film's elements remain cryptic, but not unreachable, primordially an infamous scene with a flock of horses, which apparently some people find way to obscure ad random. But I suggest you catch the film again, cause the horses element is actually very though through, and to my opinion, very clever, and the key to the answer of that puzzle, which is really the only truly puzzling element of the film is in there in the film, you don't need to read anything to catch it. If anyone is interested, here is a clue, Clayton's son talked about it a lot, and Clayton came across it in Arthur's loft, I guess you know what I'm talking about.On with the review, as with all films with a clever screenplay with sharp dialogs, it has a great cast to back it up. George Clooney is very interesting as Michael Clayton, a no BS performance that's subtle, appropriate, deep, and intensely realistic, which supports the realism of the whole film. Besides, this is not a Clooney we've seen before, forget the cocky thief Daniel Ocean, or the intense CIA operative Bob Barnes, this is a great role, which takes great pride in the phrase ""less is more"". Tom Wilkinson was fantastic as Arthur Edens, he reminded me of the late Peter Finch in Network, and his character, although not as extensive as that of Howard Beale, served a similar purpose in the drama of the movie. Wilkinson brought enormous life and intensity, as a counterpart to Clooney's low key character, which I think is not what people were expecting, but was something I found very refreshing. Also very refreshing was Tilda Swinton, as the cruel yet invaded with concerns Karen Crowder, her character, and the way she is developed is brilliant, both on the page, on film, and in her performance, again her character is sort of similar as Faye Dunaway's Diana in Network, yet, she is developed and portrayed in the complete opposite way, she is kind of a pathetic female villain, you hate her, yet you empathize with her due to the humanity she exposes, enough said, what could be better than that. Finally, Sydney Pollack, the best Actor Director, and in his case, Producer in the business after Woody Allen, he is always wonderful to look at, he has such a great sense of timing, of delivery, and a naturalism, no matter what he does, I buy it completely.The music by James Newton Howard is extremely subtle, but it's quite effective, it's a rare little gem. Robert Elswit did an amazing job, the film has a great look, it's a very realistic cinematography that doesn't call too much attention to itself.I guess I've pretty much have established that subtlety is a sort of leitmotif in Michael Clayton, and indeed it is, it's a dense film told in a subtle style, that doesn't bring too much attention to itself. I think that is what has got most of the audience sort of lukewarm with the movie, nonetheless, it was a big favorite at the Academy Awards, and with very good reasons. I congratulate Tony Gilroy and the entire cast of Michael Clayton for doing the film, the way it was made, and I hope people look at it more carefully in the future. as Michael Clayton himself, ""this is not the movie you kill!""",Michael Clayton

270,robwealer,Lots of markers but no follow through...,7,15 October 2007,"Film put lots of things in place thematically to carry off a rich storyline but did not seem to follow through. Main character of this film was the starkness of these people's perfunctory and marginal moral existences and director's job was so good, redeeming elements did not seem to come through when they really needed to. Implicit in this story was a building metamorphosis, re-awakening of moral conscience by the lead and some supporting characters but they hardly seemed to rise above it in any recognizable or meaningful way. Again, the moral indifference of the characters was so detailed, I really didn't care that they might come to some meaningful conclusions. Tom Wilkinson's character was by far the most compelling and workable in this scenario and the rest could not hold a light to it. Thematic continuity continually suffered in an often uneven delivery of basic ideas and too much reliance on viewer presumption of internal goings on of characters to support a script that was brilliant at times but not throughout. Ending was a perfect example of director's obvious shortcuts to cover lapses in dialog, again sometimes brilliant and sometimes bizarre.Won't be renting this to see again although not a bad bang for the buck.",Michael Clayton

Tightly edited, beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted--there is very little one can criticize. Clooney is perfectly suited for the lead character, the one lawyer at the firm who does more work outside the courtroom than inside; the protector of the firm with a conscience. There is a scene somewhere around the middle of the movie where Clooney runs into the center of a field and 3 horses stand there---the camera moves in to a close-up of the horses, with haunting music in the background--and at this point, I realized that I didn't ever want the movie the end.The story is also riveting and will definitely hold your attention. It is a complex storyline, but not so complex that you get totally lost. Most of the characters are neither purely good, nor purely evil, but somewhere in between. Even though Tilda Swinton's character is ruthless, there are moments where the viewer feels sympathy for her, like when she rehearses some of her lines for a meeting in front of a mirror. If you were not lucky enough to see this at the theater, run go rent it now! It is one of the best movies to have come out in years.

This is his job. He's a lawyer turned problem solver for a prestigious law firm in Manhattan. It's not exactly his life's ambition job but he's good at it. When a sticky situation arises, he deals with it swiftly and silently, making sure the firm or its clients are well shielded.In one of the more unusual problems, he is called away to a client site because one of the firm's attorneys, and close colleague, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), stripped naked in the middle of a deposition and declared his love to the plaintiff. Michael flies out and quickly initiates damage control. Turns out Arthur forgot to take his medication for a few days, however, the client, an agricultural chemical company, is still angry. This is a multi-million dollar wrongful-death claim against them. Then, Arthur begins ranting and raving about conspiracy theories and cover ups involving the firm and the agricultural company. He believes they are responsible for the deaths. Is he on to something or is this part of his mental breakdown?Michael Clayton is a slick movie with even slicker actors. The whole cast puts in stellar performances. Clooney portraying a man wrestling with morals. Wilkinson balancing on the edge of insanity.

Every second she was on screen was riveting and her Oscar is well deserved.I loved so much about this film, including Sydney Pollack's natural style and Tom Wilkinson's brilliant depiction of a relapsed manic (or was he really?) who was clearly more visionary than madman.The last few minutes are certainly the most dramatically intense I have experienced in a film in long time, so much so that in final credits cab ride with the title character I found myself close to tears as I tried to sort through the intense and ambivalent emotions.And even though you can't dispute that Day-Lewis was born to win the Oscar he took here, our friend George is no slouch either, and his negotiation of the moral ambiguities of his oddly likable character is second only to Tilda Swinton's performance.Not a perfect film, but I do give it 10 in an effort to influence the score.

278,film_reviewer-1,1st time seen -- will see it twice,8,14 October 2007,"2nd posting (after box office numbers came in):Creepy aspects of character played by Wilkinson may hurt box office in the malls of USA. Meanwhile, on the same opening weekend, Bill Cosby is on ""Meet the Press"" trying to use his platform in the entertainment industry to criticize radio-TV-film for all the unnecessary foul language and street-like behaviors.The creepy side to Wilkinson's character is not going to help the box office even though I get the idea that it's to create tension, but it may also be an attempt to get street credentials. If that's the goal, it didn't work. Teenage boys are not coming. They're going for Resident Evil stuff. Hollywood sometimes just doesn't have the pulse. I cannot see a whole lot of men going to this film without their female other. Women cringe. (And isn't it Hollywood's calculation that women will be drawn in by George Clooney).The producers hurt their box office by putting a few unnecessary smutty references (that a few other critics have mentioned more articulately than I) in the film. Realism aside, it hurts this film, which is unfortunate. The unfolding of the story was handled in an interesting way. (I just hope that Hollywood doesn't blame the film structure for the opening weekend's disappointing box office). And that's sad, because this script was good and precision-like. 1st posting :Tom Wilkinson was great in ""Separate Lies,"" less so in Michael Clayton. Tilda Swinton provides a fascinating portrayal, not that unlike the vulnerable character played by Jodie Foster in ""Silence of the Lambs."" She deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.Clever writer/ director Gilroy does a nice job controlling the tension and setting up all the characters -- both major and minor. He satisfies the Hollywood machine while handing in something better and more finely tuned than a standard thriller. The ending is boring and needs more of a Syrianna-kind of finale. (The audience who will stay with this film will probably be more hungry for complication than simple endings).Though a fan of backstory, I find Clooney's character doesn't seem to jive with the sophisticated Clooney. He's too cavalier (or whats-the-word) to be believable as a former stiff from a working class family. The backstory of the characters of Wilkinson and Swinton would be a lot more interesting. Gilroy seems to want to say that children have insight. Their exploratory nature leads them to be more pure and inquisitive.",Michael Clayton

280,rich-464,It seems close ... but no cigar,4,13 October 2007,"Michael Clayton is a movie where you leave the theater thinking to yourself: ""am I the only one who didn't get it?"" and maybe feeling a little guilty about not liking it all that much.Maybe I've been watching too much ""Top Chef"" on TV, but this movie felt like a gourmet dish where something's not quite right - the flavors are wonderful but don't go together, etc. The performances are good. Cinematography, first-rate. And yet it just didn't work for me.I realized at the end of the movie that I just didn't care about ""Michael Clayton""; through the movie, I was rooting for George Clooney, not ""Michael Clayton"". George Clooney never became Michael Clayton for me, and so the other characters, as well-acted as they were, continued to feel like props, not people. As a result, it left me flat and unfulfilled.I left the theater feeling as if I had watched a movie. When I leave the theater after seeing a good movie, I feel as if I had just spent two hours in another life. This didn't accomplish that.So if you love George Clooney, see the movie, root for Clooney, and see how things turn out for the character he plays. If you're ambivalent about Clooney, don't bother. There's little else for you.",Michael Clayton
281,Cagney,Excellent writing. Excellent acting,10,13 October 2007,"The best movie I've seen in a long time. Intelligent plot which didn't rely on action, gunfights or explosions to create suspense. Well though out & well written. Oscar material.George Clooney has proved his acting ability & his depth with this film. Tom Wilkinson has also done a superior job and Sidney Pollack is, as always, a delight to watch. The writer of this film has produced a great story, with enough twists & turns to keep the audience captivated for the entire length of the film, including an ending which, while not completely unpredictable was enough to keep one guessing.Great film. Absolutely should get an Oscar nomination.",Michael Clayton

THe other movies do not very strong plots, even if they do, like in ""Michael Clayton"", the focus on plot is very real, not sensational or in a thriller way of the Mission impossible types. Wow.. its amazing the pace of these movies and the reality of life they reflect.On to Michael Clayton, Nothing big new on the plot, and the truth that personal guilt will make you change and will not let you do the wrong thing. One amazing dialog is of Arthur in the movie, ""someone comes like a lens and you are able to see the world in a different manner through it"". The pace again is phenomenal, the characterization, the acting all amazing. Although I don't drink, but this movie has to be savoured, do not wait for things to happen, the right vs. wrong or anything, just float with it. It will be a joyride, Enjoy!!!!",Michael Clayton
283,vdecaire,Legal thrillers and character-driven dramas at the peak of their captivation,9,8 July 2008,"Michael Clayton(George Clooney) is an attorney for a law firm in New York City. He's Satan's go-getter and is a shark that attach's it's teeth on the case and doesn't let go until i's completely drained of blood--no stragglers, or visible leavings. Clayton is a man who understands there are rules that can be bent, and for a price, he's the one to bend them. An efficient amount of time in the film is devoted to let us know that there are men in New York who seem well suited to the upper-class environment on the outside; sport coats, ties, trench coats, but inside they are ready to pounce on the prey. Director Tony Gilroy (who's the soul beneficiary of credit for the script and direction) does wonders with the tone of the film; and is never off-beat. Keen wit and sharp moral satire of men and woman of tight balances between work and personal lives. Thus making a point of people who take their work home with them in their head, and suffer grammatically while itching to get back to work. Producing was done by Sydney Pollak, Steve Samuels, among others, they do a great over-all job. Executive producers include Clooney, Steven Soderbergh and Anthony Minghella. The plot focus' in on the life of Clayton, but sort of veers off into a multiple protagonist storyline that begins to explore the emotional depths of these persons without souls, one in particular, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) who has a chemical imbalance that prescription drugs can seize, but personal life and work can't. And, as the plot develops, we see that the fellow that's not-all-there is struggling to keep a lid on his uncontrollable outrage toward the business. Now looky here, we have a Tilda Sweedon-- who's honestly never done better, in a role that rivals Cate Blanchette's Bob Dylan-- who plays Karen Crowder, a fine-and-dandy little company called U-North's chief counsel, who discovers that the crazy-guy has found evidence that U-North has bad crap that causes cancer, and is planning to do something with it, her first instinct is rash, but these executive decisions usually are. She has two big dudes follow and basically probe Arthur Edens to death, and following the passing of Arthur, Crowder thinks she's off the hook, but your never off the hook when Michael Clayton is on the prowl. He smells something wrong with her and jumps at the opportunity to do something about it. But I've gotten ahead of myself, prior these fun little folk-tales, Arthur,in a fit of craziness at a business meeting, he strips down and runs outside only to be arrested and begin a chain-reaction that ends up in a great little family-friendly multi-billion dollar case. When you have a multi-billion dollar case, Who do you call? Ghostbusters? Transformers? Oprah? Nope! Michael Clayton, silly. He takes care of things as usual, until they get a little deeper then just another court-case that'll be on TV in a few days, but transform into something of a personal awakening for good ol' Mickey, who'll benefit in ways he never dreamed of. Need I say more? I doubt it. Michael Clayton is the year's best legal thriller, although among precious few, it holds many key cinematic gems and sub-messages that There Will Be Blood and Juno don't. There are things those masterpieces have Clayton doesn't. But listen up: Michael Clayton is a badass who could care less if a few people are weed-whacked on the job, but in the end, when Michael leaves the hotel after taking care of business(just to inform you, kickass Clayton turns around and does something good, takes care of the old witch that killed the crazy guy who, believe it or not, made the most sense in the movie), and gets in a cab and speeds off, thinking about the turn of events that occurred here, perhaps he liked doing something good, something right right for the first time in his sandy career as a shark that liked to swim close to the shore line, so-to-speak. Michael Clayton is a legal thriller and character-driven drama that exposes corporate boo-boos and when those boo-boos get called on by ""the fixer"" Michael Clayton. Clooney gives a captivating performance that, unlike his role in Syriana, shakes the viewer to the bone. The third best picture of the year. By: Greg Decaire",Michael Clayton
284,darrhling,"Just for a moment, assume this isn't madness.",6,21 May 2011,"An intelligent film that hits the viewer from the start with fast shots and swift dialogue, asking the audience to pay attention to detail and to look behind the basics of the story. Without this effort, it is simply an average legal thriller which ticks all the boxes of suspense, fast cars, and the natural tension of hope that the party you're cheering on wins at the end of the day.This said, I personally find George Clooney to be a monotonous actor, cursed by the bane of being forever stuck in similar, emotionally hollow roles. Michael Clayton was not an exception to this: even the opening scene had an aftertaste of Ocean's Eleven, while the story could easily have been a weaker thriller version of Erin Brokovich.However, Michael Clayton manages to redeem itself by focusing on a very interesting detail of corporate life, which can be applied to most people, regardless of where they work. This is the question which resonates throughout the film, of whether the characters are truly spending their lives doing what they want to do. In this sense, it is a film which invites the viewer to a spot of introspection and self-analysis & it succeeds very well in this area.Some typically superb acting goes on by Tilda Swinton and the film comes to a clever, if predictable ending. Michael Clayton is worth watching: those who enjoy usual legal thrillers are in for something rather more sophisticated, but all the while not failing in proving all the action necessary; those who prefer the philosophical genre or high-class social critique will be slightly disappointed, but not so much as to warrant giving this film a pass. In sum: good, but not great.(Please take the time to say whether you found this review useful. Thanks)",Michael Clayton

286,Vicky_baba,Its dark....its brooding...its boring..,3,8 November 2007,"The only reason i Saw Micheal clayton was because Roger Ebert gave it four stars.He is right 99% of the time,but as in the case of fight Club and Gladiator,he is wrong.Or maybe his opinion just doesn't match mine.Ebert calls Clayton an 'good exercise in the legal/thriller' genre.I fail to see how.Watching Michael clayton is like walking into a conversation among strangers.Maybe you know what they are talking about or maybe you just done care.Story aside, watching the movie is a complete pain.Keeping the audience guessing is one thing,to leave questions answered is another.I read Eberts review and walked in knowing the story and yet,i felt irritated by the way it was put together.Its basically a 15 min story stretched into 2 hours,and those 15 mins is generic stuff that you find in TV dramas.The story has gaping holes and makes glaring leaps and hopes the audience doesn't notice.Tell me something,if we are smart enough to piece together a jigsaw puzzle of a movie, don't you think we realize that throwing a watch and wallet into a burning car doesn't prove anything?Seriously.Call me childish for asking for a smooth narrative with some real moral conflict.I think the movie would have made more interesting if it had been shown from the perspective of the lawyer who goes ballistic and runs naked through the snow.At least he seems human.",Michael Clayton
287,bowtiecinema,The Most Overrated Film of The Year,2,27 January 2008,"This film reminds me of Network and also of a John Grisham adaptation. I guess it's hard to think of anybody other than John Grisham when your dealing with a serious conspiracy story based around lawyers, but if only Michael Clayton were a John Grisham book then perhaps it might have worked. The story behind this film and its ending is quite good, it's only that the majority of this film bores the heck out of you! This is Tony Gilroy's directing debut (he was the screenwriter on the Bourne films) and his screenplay for it is not his most impressive work. With such producers attached to this project as Clooney (he also stars as the lead role), Sydney Pollack (who also plays a supporting role), Anthony Minghella (director of Cold Mountain, The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley), and Steven Soderbergh (director of the Ocean's films and Traffic) I would expect maybe something at least worth watching. The best part about this film is the supporting performance by Tom Wilkinson. Otherwise this film might leave you with a good feeling because of its ending, which would be good if it was supported by the rest of the film, but if this film bores me- and I'm not easily bored by movies- then I can't image much of modern A.D.D. audience being able to watch this film. It certainly doesn't deserve any of the Oscars it was nominated for.",Michael Clayton
288,George_Huang,A realization of the possible justice,10,22 October 2007,"With previous works on similar subjects such as ""The Firm,"" ""A Civil Action"" and ""Erin Brockovich,"" how can this one pull it off better? No one would ever believe it can until they see it themselves. Tony Gilroy, the screenwriter of ""The Bourne"" trilogy, revisits the saint-or-sinner theme in ""The Devil's Advocate"" and brings an excellent script that is full of precise dialog and intense sequences.Michael Clayton, the senior lawyer in his firm, has fixed up many troubling cases which might not be considered as justice methods. Until another senior partner of the firm, Arthur Edens, freaked out at a hearing, the turning point of his life comes along with it unexpectedly.Just like any of us, Clayton has to deal with many difficulties in life. Besides the handful works, there are also the child support and the dept owed by his brother. His son, Henry, is a smart kid and fully realizes the way life is. On the contrary, Timmy, his younger brother, just couldn't know how to stay out of trouble despite of having an older brother, Gene, who happens to be an officer.The case which makes Edens freak out or just pretend to is a lawsuit involves with billions of dollars and hundreds of lives. It's not a rare affair in the U.S. and also one of the bigger ones that makes law firms make profits by helping big industries. But do the lawyers can all manage the deals without their conscience? Yes is the more likely answer.Unlike the conscience Edens discovers within himself, the executive spokesman, Karen Crowder, doesn't care anything else but the welfare of the firm and, of course, of herself. But she is in fact very diffident due to her position and her sex. The only way she can breakthrough these odds is to make her bosses impressive.As many have said in their reviews, George Clooney gave his best performance to date. He portrayed this role which is the key to the success of the movie brilliantly with every look, every move and every line that he has to as also an executive producer. He's a strong Oscar contender already.The acclaimed but overlooked actor Tom Wilkinson does another great job as Edens. The reason and insanity of the role can both be seen through his limited but powerful interpretation.It's even more thrilling to see Tilda Swinton in the cast. Very different from her previous roles which are well-known as authoritative and neuter, she dealt with a feminine role which tries to act strong but actually weak this time.Another executive producer and the director of ""The firm,"" Sydney Pollack, took the part which is only bigger than a cameo, shows his interest in this genre once more and being an actor besides already an acclaimed film director. Along side is Steven Soderbergh, the old pal of Clooney and the director of ""Erin Brokovich."" With the constant dialog, it might fail to satisfy action-flick fans easily which it seems like one in the trailer. But as a suspense thriller, it's possibly the best one of the year or even in years. The important topic of the downfall sense of justice is a very present message to the society which is filled with the value that measured by money and power. And the gripping storytelling and the dream-alike ensemble cast shows what a good movie is made of.As the credit shows on the right, the face of Clayton is still shown on screen which tells more about his feeling after the immense scenes he has just been through. Gilroy added a touch of realism to the ending after the metaphor sequence with the horses in the mist.",Michael Clayton
289,rich-rossi-50,"Fantastic Dialogue, Story, and Acting",10,24 April 2017,"There aren't many movies that I enjoy watching twice or more, this is certainly one of them. This is in the running to be my favorite movie of all time. This movie can be hard to follow, and can seem vulgar at times, but in reality the dialogue has a higher purpose: to illustrate how we can get lost in our personal objectives and lose track of the bigger picture. The majority of characters in this movie don't fall into the ""good guy"", ""bad guy"" category, they are various shades of gray, just like real people. If one puts themselves in the shoes of the characters, their actions are plausible and consistent with reality. If you don't want to have your brain challenged by a time-line that bounces around and a complicated story that requires the viewer to put the pieces together you might want to save this for another night, but don't miss it, it's an incredible piece of writing and filmmaking.",Michael Clayton
290,stuart_a_mack,Legal drama not a thriller!,7,11 October 2007,"From the beginning you are shown a character (Clooney) who although a lawyer from a prominent Law firm is anything but within the Law.Interrupted at a late night illegal card game, he visits a recent hit and run driver, advising him on what actions to take, before the police are even investigating. Then after a brief drive to clear his head his car explodes! 4 Days earlier.....This film is the story of the 4 days in the life of a 'fixer' from a law firm, dealing with a failed partnership in a bar with his drug addicted brother, raising the funds to pay off a loan shark, whilst at the same time dealing with a major client whose illegal dumping of chemicals has led to a potential liability of 3 billion dollars.The case has been dragging on for some 9 years and the lead council for the defence, a manic depressive, has gone off his medication and had a breakdown during a deposition. Worse than that he has apparently had a crisis of conscience and has assembled the evidence to prove the case for the plaintiff.So, is it any good? Well yes and no! The film is really split in two, the private and public life of Michael Clayton. The failed business of the bar, the breakdown of his family relationships along with an increasing sense of isolation at work all make for a compelling story that doesn't quite deliver on its emotional potential.The understated performance of Clooney (Devoid of his usual smirk) distances you from the main character, who quite simply could never be a sympathetic hero anyway. His business is and has been for a long time correcting and sorting out the mistakes of others. And as a defence attorney we all know what a bastard he must have been, totally unredeemable.Whilst at the same time Tilda Swinton (woefully underused by Hollywood) presents a baffling performance of a rabbit trapped in the head lights. Where was the sharp, ambitious devious, vicious bitch that this character should have been. Instead we see a woman wrecked with self doubt and an unhealthy looking sweating problem.This should have been a great film, the premise was good, the actors were fine, the script didn't quite hold up and the direction wasn't sharp enough, but its still worth a watch.",Michael Clayton
291,bounty-hunter-Kabarakh,Groups of people who might not like this movie,8,11 August 2009,"I will take a different approach on this comment, than I do usually. Instead of describing why one might like this movie, I give some thoughts to people who won't like it.There are three groups of people I can think of, which might not like this movie.The first group comprises people, that watch movies for pure entertainment. They seek for enjoyment in a positive way. They don't watch movies to be remembered of problems in this world, on the contrary they want to forget about them when watching a movie. ""Michael Clayton"" will reward you with a wonderful conclusion, but I still had these thoughts: Too bad, it's just fictional. I would really like to see it for real, a corporation like ""U/North"" getting a good spanking. So it's not a movie for these kind of people. It is just too serious for that.The second group is rather a small one, I suppose. It comprises those people, who will see their own bad actions reflected in this movie. Of course, there is no way people like that could ever like this movie.The third group are those people, that will have problems to follow and understand the plot. ""Michael Clayton"" is movie that expects the audience to think. It does not explicitly explain what is going on. You need to be attentive and patient. Of course, people won't like something they don't understand. And some people simply don't want to make any effort.Granted, this is oversimplifying, but not utterly wrong.Anyway, ""Michael Clayton"" is still a good movie. THAT is MY opinion.",Michael Clayton
292,matthewphmt,Boring!,2,15 October 2007,"Michael Clayton proves to be the most anti-suspenseful, anti-climactic movie of the year, so far. I mean, I was sitting--anticipating for some exciting action to take place, but instead, a stupid car blowing up only seemed to manage waking me up. This is a really bad movie! The story is stupid and pointless, and you will easily find yourself drifting during the first 30 minutes. It isn't clever. It isn't thrilling. It's BORING! Way too serious to be a good action movie! Geroge Clooney has never tackled a movie role that actually counts for something good. He sucks! He can't act! This movie was terrible!

Peck) it hosts one among my very favorite conclusions.If you regard justice as vital to personal freedom and liberty...this is on top and among the best.The subtle conclusion, George Clooney's, ""Give me fifty dollars worth, just drive..."" allows us, after the facts - some grand opportunity to review what actually happened over the previous 100 moments. Folks, this is brilliant acting.Rewind, rewind...I dare you to not stand and cheer.10/10 - damn hard to beat.",Michael Clayton
294,wxgirl55,"A satisfying flick, but you have to pay attention.",7,14 September 2007,"Saw this at a screening at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival.This movie is appropriately titled ""Michael Clayton"" because in it we are introduced to the man in his many life roles; father, ex-husband, brother, son, friend and businessman. Some things he's good at, others not so much.Terry Gilroy's debut directing showed a controlled and restrained hand, allowing the multi-tracked storyline to expand and grow, but always with a pull back to the core. For a fairly busy plot with numerous sub-characters, he did a good job of turning over pieces of the puzzle to bring the audience back full circle to the opening scene.Michael Clayton fixes things, but we see in his own personal life there are a trail of problems he's dealing with. It's when he works alone that he seems to do his best work. Once those close to him come into his decision-making process, he lets emotions rule rather than his head.George Clooney always seems to have a message in his movies, wanting us to be aware of the evil-doers out in the world. His boyish charm and general likability makes you root for him. We can relate to him.Michael Clayton is a flawed individual who has good intentions but often gets beaten by the world and the people around him. Can't we all relate to that too? This was a satisfying suspense flick. Key to enjoying it is to pay attention.",Michael Clayton
295,barnes-183,Great movie but protagonist is bad from start to finish,10,13 October 2007,"My only complaint is that a number of reviewers have claimed that the protagonist chose to do a good deed at the end because it is the right thing. Some have claimed that with his friend's death, the evidence he found, and the fact that he had hit rock bottom in his selfish, amoral universe, that he had a change of heart. My take on this is different. Clayton does not get morality or a conscience at any time. When his car is trashed, his heart skips a beat, his pragmatic brain whirs into overdrive and he realizes that there IS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE ACTION he can take in order to better his own life. He faces felony charges and social exclusion because of his break in, U-North wants him dead, & his own boss admitted that the death of Arthur was (in a very real way) a relief (we can infer from this that his employer would NOT be sympathetic to him if he knew that U-North wanted him dead).At the time that Clayton's car blows up he can A) blackmail U-North B) run to his employer with the news that he just survived a murder attempt by U-North C) hide out in a shack somewhere for a month or D) follow the course shown in the film.If he chose option A then he would immediately lose his job and possibly any shot at continued employment in his field. Before he gets the cash he may again risk being killed. He may also risk being killed after he gets the pay-off because they may not trust his word that once he got the pay-off he would not go public or they may worry that he would ask for more blackmail money in the future.Option B, turning to his boss is a huge mess. He is wanted dead by the people who can either pay his boss tens of millions of dollars for legal fees or sue his boss for legal malpractice. I am not sure what would happen in the movie universe if he had taken this route, but the results would be iffy for Clayton at best. Legally they certainly couldn't take direct or indirect action against their own client, U-North.Option C would jeopardize his employment with his firm. If he had hidden rather than going to the police ASAP, then he could not have gotten the police to fake the death report. Without that faked report, he would continue to be a target of U-North while at the same time he would be in serious crap with his employer. Look at it from the firm's standpoint: the guy knows way too much, they just gave him $80k and w/in a day he disappears and refuses to answer his phone. They would assume the worst.Now to option D. The police can protect his life. That is a plus. His recent breaking and entering has severed important social ties he had to friends and relatives in law enforcement. By agreeing to participate in a sting of U-North he gets to survive the short term, eliminate the long term threat of murder, put himself in good standing with law enforcement in general and his brother in particular. On the down side, he is clearly going to be bounced completely out of corporate law. Given the high profile sting of an ""evil"" corp like U-North and the fact that the company that he betrayed tried to kill him, would he loose his right to practice law? Perhaps not. If not, then who would employ him? He could get a job prosecuting criminals in the DAs office (his old career).OK, what of the critical evidence? He didn't destroy all the reports that were stored at the copy place. Doesn't this indicate that he knew what was right and wanted to do good? No. The receipt he found clearly read ""C.O.D."" Did he have the money for 26 boxes of reports, could he get 26 boxes into his car and get them to a paper shredder? No. So, he runs off and leaves them there indefinitely. He may need them for leverage if things go sour or he can swing by in a few days with a U-Haul and some friends from the firm and destroy them then.OK, he didn't ""fix"" Arthur when he went rogue. Doesn't that prove that Clayton was having an episode of morals? Partially. He is friends with Arthur and this seems to somewhat inhibit his normal efficiency at cleaning up problems. However, Clayton is always looking out for himself and he knows that taking extreme measures to stop Arthur is not in his best interest. He also knows that aside from extreme measures there is very little he can do to the man.What about his trip to see the girl in the hotel room? You can interpret this as evidence that he is gathering evidence he needs to do the right thing and nail U-North. However, another explanation is that he was friends with Arthur and given evidence that his friend was killed (people don't generally commit suicide minutes before highly anticipated meetings) he felt compelled to check it out. Note that his initially questioning of her, he tried to lead her to say that she had said or done something that would have lead Arther to commit suicide. He didn't want to believe that U-North killed his friend. Note that he sleeps on the information he gets from the girl.To sum up, Clayton is a self-serving guy from beginning to end. The attempted murder made his best course of action hitting U-North. Without that attempted murder, it would have been business as usual for Clayton. He would have gone back to work, destroyed all the reports at the copy place and just kept up his normal routine.",Michael Clayton
296,jackcaptai,an over rated flick?,6,24 February 2008,i went in to this movie with all that hype floating around just before the big evening. and i was left disappointed. the story was simple and there was nothing in the name of a thriller. just a bland story with a glass eyed central character. i am not even sure why this movie is getting so many good reviews. i agree to one point that its a mature movie made with a certain degree of frankness. i mean there are no flashy actions or senseless bang bang. but it is just that. not an all out Oscar material. only the demented lawyer left any mark who came close to a insane man. i liked the company head's role too. she depicted woman who is caught in a rat race which have nothing but dead ends. these are the 2 characters who i felt gave that extra something to the movie. i feel its just an Oscar propaganda. just rent a DVD and lol around on the couch with home made lemonade. its not worth the ticket.,Michael Clayton
297,Arenarocker05,"""Do I Look Like I'm Negotiating?""",8,9 July 2008,"I saw this film last night in my room and had been wanting to see it for the longest time, mainly because everyone I spoke to kept urging me to see it. I got that chance and I found myself asking one question: Should this have been nominated for Best Picture? I will answer it by saying ""probably not,"" just because I felt as though the entire movie did not hold my complete attention as it should have. I got lost during some of the dialogue and had to rewind several times to pick up what I missed. That and the plot was becoming too convoluted for me. However do not get me wrong; George Clooney does a fantastic job acting in this picture and Tom Wilkinson is great in everything he does and not forgetting Best Supporting Actress Tilda Swinton winning that award for this film.The idea is a little different as it adds a few new elements to the crime genre. It is a court case drama with a couple of thrills thrown in, even though it never takes place in court. And as I previously mentioned before, all the actors did an outstanding job which made me appreciate the film but what really won me over was the ending, which I will leave for you to check it out, if you haven't already done so. But in the end, this film is definitely worth the rent if you want to see a new side to the element of crime.",Michael Clayton
298,jpahren,What's all the hype about?,3,6 April 2008,"I don't know why everyone thinks this movie is so great. I guess it's loved because it's main theme is how evil big, American corporations and lawyers are, and Hollywood seems to go ga-ga over that. Bashing corporate America isn't necessarily bad, but that in and of itself does not make a movie good (I liked Erin Brockovich and Wall Street, to name a few).There are some mildly interesting characters here (the female antagonist for one), but again, the movie's nothing special.On the other hand, it is very confusing. I spent the whole movie trying to even understand Clayton's basic personal problem--it still isn't believable to me. And I totally don't understand the climax near the end--I guess I'll check the message boards for explanation.There's plenty of ""troubled lawyer takes on evil corporation"" movies out there that didn't win Academy Awards and are better than this one.",Michael Clayton
299,leslieann-1,great but flawed picture,8,7 October 2007,"i went because clooney was in the film, but then was dazzled by Tom Wilkonson, Tilda Swinton and Sydney Pollack's acting in what is an ensemble performance with Clooney as the weaker element - i just could believe that he was a down-and-out gambler, or a fixer of the low-down level he was meant to be, but tant pis...in fact, the acting and the script were sort of theatrical rather than devoted to film ""reality"" - wilkinson's florid language, and the overlay of Swinton's character's practising a speech and delivering it was interesting but it took me outside the illusion - that's okay - but i never completely got a visceral reaction to the toxic poisoning that the corporation was perpetrating; years ago the Insider and Erin Brocavich grabbed me more.a young farmer who the Wilkinson character brings on to testify against his own case was not convincing at all - i do not believe her mother would let her do that trip. there is a hint of erotic attraction that is distasteful and undermines our sympathy for what wilkinson character was doing - was that intended? i did not find that girl especially cool or believable, and so i tended to dismiss the whole issue. in fact, the issue behind the shenanigans was downplayed to the human voraciousness of greed...i kept also wondering why we see the ending first - that is usually a solution to a plot gap that was plugged in this way. i am not sure what the pastoral contemplation of the horses was about except to make the blow up of the car more effective. so it was an aesthetic decision not a decision about plot. that was beautiful but weak - and a filmic element used to fix it up - but i am ""up"" for being entertained too, i guess, and that's what that moment also did. amuse us...but it was very enjoyable, and professional to a high degree, beautiful to look at without doubt, so that's good.the message was almost too broad, and i kept comparing it to the specifics of The Insider which was very persuasive and scary (and to Erin...the same), although the focus of Erin Brocavich was also on her development.here there is little sense of the Clooney character's development - it is all resolved in the end (in a bit of a rush - restaurant debt settled, rejoining his family, etc. etc.), and it works out okay - his son is a good figure, and participates in our sense of whether or not arthur is mad or not, but clooney's exchanges with him and with his former-junkie brother are just not credible - he just sticks out too much somehow. i don't know why - no underlying grit somehow (I associate it to his inability as a person to commit to a woman, and so the depths are not ever really challenged in him as a person, and so he cannot draw on that as an actor - but that's perhaps more about me than about clooney as an actor - his performance in Solaris grabbed me, however.) as you can see, it was a thoroughly thought-provoking event for me, and i'd even see it again, despite a slightly clock-work script.",Michael Clayton
300,rafasalin,Intelligent people could also do things the right way.,9,3 February 2008,"MICHAEL CLAYTON (Dir: Tony Gilroy-2007): Rafael J. Salin-Pascual Michael Clayton (George Cloony), knows that doing the right way, but ahead of clients, and people around, should be better than only to act through the wild zone, which is the stereotype and little bit more inside lawyers that are defending such companies. Clayton works directly with Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack), the head of the law firm (As in Eyes wide shut, the last movie of Stanley Kubrick, Pollack is the typical guy who knows a lot, but had a secrecy as part of to know how deal with partners, employers and clients as well).But one of Bach's top partners has just gone berserk, stripping naked in Milwaukee during a deposition hearing and running through a parking lot in the snow. This is Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), who opens the film with a desperate voice-over justifying himself to Michael. Cloony is superb, as almost always, the final scene in the taxicab with the credit on, and expresses sadness, proud, and holding a lot more feelings inside,he is for me an expert demonstration of acting. Similar to the solos in jazz or rock bands. For me he must be the winner this year of The Oscar (I've seen all he nominees and the closes opponent is Tommy Lee Jones,although for me was better in: ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" (2005))One of the several reflections of this good movie, is to show us that cleaver people are not immune to big problems. Clayton has a serious debt of $ 75,000, that may cost him to be murdered, some of that may be explained by the already closed restaurant, but also from playing cards. He is divorced, and has a son intelligent as well, with a sciences fiction test for books. So, early in he film, the boy was talking with his Dad, about a book in which there are people that live in the woods, and nobody can trust between them . That sound like a warning about what happens in Clayton's life. The ""bad woman"" of this movie, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), is acting almost excellent, in the balance (there is a long-lasting dialog, by her,about balance as a goal). But in fact, bas and good characters have both moral states. Karen is having breakdowns, of anxiety and crying. But and the end, ofher way of being, the utilitarian moral defeat whatever trace of goodnessshe may have. Although in fact Arthur Eden is having a hippo-manic phase (He is bipolar disorder patient). He use his psychiatic disorder as a tool for cover himself (kind of ""costume""), but letter on, he lunched his offensive against the polluted company. That remains me the character of Domenico ( Erland Josephson) in Andrei Tarkovsky's film ""Nostalghia""(1983). In that film Domenico lives apart from the rest of the small-town in Italy. But the interaction between the Russian poet Yankovsky and Dominico is far apart from madness. Michael Clayton is one of the finest movies of the second half of the 2007.",Michael Clayton

Little touches to let us know that the special projects man has a gambling problem and no life. Horses, in an indirect way, will save his life and well, you can sit through this couple of hours without guessing what's going to happen next and, if you permit me, without caring. I prefer George Clooney in his brighter, campier roles. I believe Cary Grant had the same problem but I would like to know who's idea was the Queen Christina moment through the closing credits.

304,I_never_sleep,"Dark, well scripted thriller",9,22 March 2013,"While the topic of Michael Clayton is a shady legal battle and the characters involved, it never threatens to become a drawn out legal drama. In fact, while almost every main character is a corporate lawyer, there are very little scenes of legal proceedings. Instead the movie focuses on the cloak and dagger plotting surrounding a case on the verge of complete disaster for all those involved. Solid performances from well casted actors and the polished dialogue keep the story development intriguing and engaging. In a similar way to the entirely different Cohen Brothers cheerful flick ""The BIg Lebowski"", it is perhaps not the catchiest movie when looking externally, but is actually taut, highly intelligent, though undemanding. ** Highly recommended **""Who are you?""

I nearly switched the DVD off last night because the beginning 45 minutes very very slow. The film turned around at this point.This is not your general action/thriller. It is a suspenseful ride, without much violence used. It is also a clever thriller. This is a good aspect though. All the actors had done superb roles, especially from Gorge Clooney. I would watch this again personally.The only bad thing is that you don't understand the story at first and it takes a while too. If your wanting the mindless, gory thriller, this is certainly NOT for you. However, if your wanting a film which is suspenseful, thoughtful and which has a moral in it, you will REALLY enjoy this film.I would give it solid 9.5/10.

It's just like ""The insider"". Nothing happens in that one either. Also I find Clooneys acting static and unengaging. It's like he only has one facial expression to draw upon.

I have to say i was more entertained by the film than i thought. At first i found it a little hard to follow but as the story progressed it became clearer. The film was a little slow, but given its plot and topic of choice, i cant see it being any other way. The film is about lawyers and the idea that if you have a secret that could destroy a company, somebody will shut you up in a lethal way. hence ""the truth can be adjusted"" This film was very cold and it was filmed in cold weather which added to the effect. Overall id say the idea of the film was descent, not the most original, but worth while.There were several side characters and happenings that i found really pointless for the film. Such as Clooneys brother, chats with his son, and the hit and run accident in the beginning. I had a hard time figuring out what the relevance these particular events and people had to the story. If you expect this film to be action packed, its not for you.If you expect it to have a warm resolved ending, its not for youbut, if you like dramas and are into lawyer corporate type movies, then it is for you. Overall it was a pretty good film, definitely better than i thought.",Michael Clayton
312,sr3500,Very Good,8,24 January 2011,"This film is impressive in nearly every regard. The dialogue was first rate, the acting (especially Wilkinson and Pollack) was fine-tuned and pitch perfect, and the story was well crafted and plausible. I can't find an original novel of this story, but that's the sense I got - that this was adapted from a larger, more detailed, good novel. The story captures a person's inner disintegration when they allow their integrity to be compromised routinely, over years. It's a shame that films of this quality get middling reviews. It's as though if your protagonist doesn't have three fistfights and a rooftop chase by an hour in, your suspense is ""slow to develop"". Or if your exposition is subtle, your film is ""hard to follow"". This is an intelligent, well made film about a person's fidelity with their core beliefs and the things they truly value.

Although the acting by everyone involved was comfortably above par, I suppose the script left something more. Things speed up so soon at the end that I got this uncomfortable feeling that I didn't get everything out of it. I think there ought to have been a better way to make this movie because it is a solid, compelling story but just told in an unfriendly manner. The first half was initially disturbing because one couldn't figure out what is going on and what does Clooney's character actually do. While later on the story does fill up and while some of the ""hunting"" sequences were well done, in the end things just get unraveled too quickly.

For me, as for anyone, certain movies are better than others. But if there were some sort of absolute terms or qualities by which movies may be rated I'm sure this one in particular would excel in all. There is of course the intense and complex plot which intertwines Mr. Clayton's personal and professional life but there is also the bewildering and grayish scenery which fits to perfection with a narrative based on moral dilemmas, personal burdens and institutional shrewdness. The first minutes of the movie, as Arthur narrates his personal deception as head of a legal defense effort, one realizes having chosen a complicated story which might -or might not- deliver and fortunately -or unfortunately- it does. All other aspects of great cinematography aside, what really amazed me, and kept me from sleeping that night, was the inhumanity and unrighteousness of Karen as Counsel of U-North and how it collides with Arthur's moral collapse. It was shocking-perhaps owed to the reality with which it is displayed-that a single, self-centered, greed-consumed woman, could take such decisions regardless of what board members, shareholders or other directors of the company she worked for might have thought and with complete disregard for other's lives. It really makes one feel defenseless. Also shocking is how, at the end of the movie, she remorselessly describes the settlement as appropriate for the tax benefits it would result into.

When movie after movie portrays this image, as a society we begin to believe it. That's just not healthy, and it spoils a lot of the movie.The continual close-up shots of all of the actors lend an aura of reality and intimacy that help tell the story, and the Karen Crowder character (Tilda Swinton) is one of the most interesting villains in modern film-making.

Yes, yes, I Know, Your Author wrote the three Bourne and they are great, but let's face it, those novels couldn't be ruined (well, maybe if Joel Schumacher...),and the directors helped a lot there. But not to loose the point, I was asking you about your script. Easy questions first: Why did you put the smart kid if you will not use it in the story? How come the police think you're dead just because you threw your wallet and watch into a burning car? Whatever happened to Anna, what is the reason for that character even existing? Arthur could have had the same stupid remorse without her, as we've seen in 1000 movies before you. If you get to answer this ones, then please tell me what kind of lawyer are you. You seemed pretty expendable, being your main purpose to guard a crazy-genius lawyer and organizing his funeral. Yeah, Michael should have stayed as a prosecutor. A final question. Arthur was a genius and managed to get all those documents ( we never find out how) But he didn't think they would kill him- obviously he was to busy as to watch any lawyer movie around-, so, instead of giving a copy to every newspaper, he calls his own office and reads the memo? Oh, right, he was getting the copies with the red cover, silly me. Well, on the bright side, your direction in better than your script, and great actors -Clooney, Swinton and Wilkinson- do the best they can and manage to make the movie at least not a complete waste of film.

319,RedSectorA,An Excellent Story of Greed Versus Morality....,9,20 April 2009,"The ""beauty"" of the film Michael Clayton is not only the movie itself, but the fact that it has become a film that garners your attention every time you see it...you don't know why, but you drop everything you are doing to watch it... As for the film itself, Michael Clayton is powerful on many levels, specifically in the emotion of greed and the lack of morality in one's life when greed is jeopardized or threatened.George Clooney plays ""Michael Clayton"", a former attorney, DA who has become the main ""go to guy"" in a 600 head law firm. The law firm's principal partner is ""Marty Bach"", played by the late, great, Sydney Pollack. Michael Clayton's sole professional purpose is to be the guy that ""knows all, sees all, can handle everything and fix anything"" for his law firm or more important the firms clients. Aside from being the broker for his law firm's merge with another firm, Pollack's character is one of a mentor yet mild antagonist to Clooney's as he treats Michael Clayton with the reverence of an equal, yet is quick to affirm what Michael Clayton ""is"" and who he ""isn't"". Yes, Michael Clayton can ""fix"" anything, but it is Marty Bach that ""governs"" everything in this law firm. As you learn more about Clooney's character you are introduced to a variety of people who also treat Michael Clayton with a similar irreverence...which reveals that Michael Clayton has an ""importantance"" to his firm, yet he is isolated as an individual. Personally, you also see Michael Clayton challenged with his own family and his responsibility to his son. Tom Wilkinson plays ""Arthur Edens"", an esteemed attorney for Michael Clayton's law firm and one of Clayton's few friends. The movie begins and centers around Arthur's ""falling off"" the legal wagon, causing an incident during a deposition...which suddenly puts the ""firm"" and their largest client, ""U North"" in peril. The perception is Arthur Edens has flipped out and needs to be ""muted"". It is Micheal Clayton that is called upon to neutralize the situation internally with Arthur, as well as externally with the lead counsel of U North, ""Karen Crowder"" played by Tilda Swinton. As the movie progresses, Tom Wilkinson's character ""Arthur"" becomes aloof, AWOL, out of reach of Micheal Clayton and soon becomes the center of attention with U North who decides to take matters in their own hands. The most memorable scene in the movie comes when Michael Clayton finally locates Arthur. They have a heated conversation that not only reveals Arthur's sanity but also clarifies just how irrelevant Michael Clayton may be. During that encounter, Michael Clayton desperately insists to Arthur ""I'm not the enemy"" to Arthur's response of ""then who are you?"", which invalidates every perception of Arthur and Michael Clayton at once. Michael Clayton then begins to realize that his own existence, while important to him, is nothing more than a commodity to his peers. This is where the salvation of Michael Clayton begins...in order to save Arthur Edens, Michael Clayton needs to save himself...in essence, Michael Clayton becomes the hunted and faces his own extinction...nowhere to turn, nobody to trust and nowhere to hide.As the movie reaches it's pinnacle, each character is presented with the understated question and notion of greed versus morality and what will people do to preserve it? As the end credits roll and without dialog, you see the emotions of a man reflecting on his own purposes in life...a metaphor to how Michael Clayton existed...isolated, alone, unaware of where he is going and unsure of redemption. Michael Clayton is a very powerful film.Enjoy!",Michael Clayton

Spear headed by an apocalyptic and profound monologue by Tom Wilkinson, this film becomes increasingly hard to look away from.Director Tony Gilroy, who is probably most famous as the screenwriter of the Jason Bourne series, does a fantastic job of pacing this film from start to finish, and also excels in developing George Clooney's character in the title role. There are a lot of movies out their that are like ""Michael Clayton"" as far as plot goes, however this film seems to go so much deeper than many of it's predecessors. Movies like ""The Insider"" with Russell Crow come to mind, where, after a while, certain scenes become predictable and boring. This movie stays interesting and it just has a very original aura about it.George Clooney plays the role of a long time lawyer, down on money, who seems to have found himself being the ""janitor"" of the firm, having to clean up after other peoples messes. A man who spent too many years in such a grimy position that he is completely burnt out and lost in the world he built for himself. Acting opposite Wilkinson could only have helped Clooney's performance, as Wilkinson's portrayal, of a defense lawyer ready to burn the integrity of his firm to the ground was so fantastic, it had to be contagious to those around him.

321,user297257,Big disappointment,2,17 October 2007,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie only to be dropped flat. Excellent actors, lousy parts. I didn't get attached to anyone in the movie, except for George Clooney's son, who was more of a plot device prop, than a character. There are extra, pretty useless characters, like the drunk brother that waste the viewers time and don't really pay off in the end. The same set up could have existed without the extra family. I'll allow one coincidence to every screenwriter, but this movie is chock full of them. Clooney just happens to have a brother on the police force. He just happens to run into the lunatic lawyer who's hiding from everybody. He just happens to pull over to look at horses when his car blows up. And so on. We have to see this stupid scene not once, but twice. Why does he stop to look at the horses for crying out loud? The first time I see it I think surely its a set up that will pay off later. But no. Not to mention, the writer would have been wise to sit up for an all night marathon of CSI to think we would buy that his throwing a watch, wallet and cell phone in a burning car would equate to somebody thinking he was dead. Hello? the most basic forensically challenged would realize these items would burn up. Yet the absences of a corpse, well, that wouldn't throw anyone off. And the killing of the lunatic lawyer, well, gee, an ""apparent suicide"" for overdose would include an examination of his stomach contents, which, surprise, would not have included all those pills since his killers injected him with the drugs that kill him. Somewhere in all the hacked, arty story telling there was a half way decent plot that got wasted on this dreary, boring, annoying product. I was so far ahead of everyone in it, I wanted to just stand up and announce what was going to happen so we could all go home. Everybody in the theater groaned at the end. Maybe a few simple people that are in love with George Clooney will enjoy it, but I'd rather watch repeated reruns of ER.",Michael Clayton

But the temptation was there mind it. though to me it was always ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" which started all. now days it's all about George Clooney phenomenon anyway. i mean he is practically everywhere directing , starring in substantial projects & even handling all kind of issues beyond movies. now to wrap up here, i like to say there are two most striking moments in the movie. one has to be a pure mr:clooney moment, displaying his amazing capability how versatile can he be really in a very rare angry mood ""do i look like I'm negotiating here"" guys, check that out. the other moment is the ending. somehow it's remind me of the last scene of ""La Dolce Vita"" in a completely contrast way where one couldn't not escape but the other one made the right choice. good team work by the director & script writer. it's their moment basically. the final credit scene kind of reminds me of a thought provoking German film, ""das experiment"" where the protagonist finally rests in complete silence after............... what! you want to know more, watch the film by yourself. i promise it's much more fun,guaranteed.",Michael Clayton

324,grafaelp,Substance and Form,9,15 October 2007,"Tremendous. Once in a while you leave the movie theater understanding why you spend the time and energy to see a film. This was one of those times. In a day and age when words such as 'evil' and 'bad guys' are thrown about in the media like they mean something I've witnessed a movie that makes us root for a character that's morally suspect. Not quite an antihero, but definitely not Jimmy Stewart, we're shown that the world is gray. Both visually, as is the case in this film, and ethically. Nobody's hands were clean in this one. But in the end it's about an engaging story that comes dangerously close to real world news stories we see everyday. The direction was as subtle as the acting and the writing. I just want to express my appreciation for all the players involved in bringing this film to the theater. I'm sure it wasn't easy. But looking back on many of my favorite films I'm sure they weren't either.",Michael Clayton

326,tcadier,Don't trust the trailer!,10,16 December 2007,"Michael Clayton is the story of a problem-fixer of a law firm named Michael Clayton.Although the story seems very confusing in the 20 first minutes of the movie, the story clarifies itself in the rest of the movie. It sort of unravels. Don't judge this movie by its trailer, because the trailer was made in a very confusing way in which you don't understand the core of the story.What I particularly liked in this movie is the ""verbal action"", as I like to call it. Unlike the John Grisham movies, which are based in a lot of action, this movie most only uses the argumentation between the characters. And it is those conversations between these characters that drives the action and that makes you get attached to the story and the characters.I recommend this film to all movie-lovers because of the story. I believe that those that liked ""Constant Gardener"", will love this one, as it has superficially the same story.I think that the golden globe nominations were very-well deserved, especially the one for Tom Wilkinson although it is most likely for Casey Affleck to win for ""The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"".",Michael Clayton
327,phirug,Criminally underrated,10,3 January 2020,"Every once a blue moon a movie hooks me, grabs me, and haunts me. This is one of those films. I won't bother rehashing the plot as other reviewers have done here, you can read the synopsis for yourself - and maybe it seems drab. The film is perfectly executed by it's director and this IS George Clooney's greatest performance. And Tilda Swinton is Tilda Swinton. And Tom Wilkerson is Tom Wilkerson. Those 2 are 2 of our greatest living actors. You will hate the company involved in the lawsuit, but do you hate Swinton's character? She is not your postcard villain.

Oh, it has most of the standard trappings of one: double-crossing, shady back room deals, and a guilty client. But in the case of Michael Clayton, the film focuses most of its attention on the questionable moral quagmire of working for guilty clients, living your life protecting those who you can't help but find reprehensible, wanting to get out, but finding you are good at it and that is where your superiors want you. Michael Clayton isn't a revelatory film, but it is a smart one that deals in the grey world that we all live in, not the black and white one legal films are usually about.",Michael Clayton
329,ed_reed,"Great performances, and script and star turn by Tom Wilkinson",8,21 October 2007,"An exceptional thriller centred around key players during a crisis within the machinery of big business (a law firm in this instance) and the parts they play in trying to prevent the wheels from coming off.The strengths of this moving are the strong and wholly believable characters underpinned by a great script delivered excellently by the entire cast. Although the story itself is nothing new the sum of the remaining parts push this thriller into the top band for such films. All members of the cast are superb. George Clooney deservedly wins plaudits as the flawed 'fixer' at the centre of the unfolding drama, whose own personal problems are no easier to solve. Tilda Swinton puts in a great performance as the powerful corporate lawyer who starts out perhaps a little out of her depth before her character soon finds herself sinking fast into the murky world where criminality meets the corporation.However for me special praise should go to Tom Wilkinson. He usually turns in a fine performance whatever he's in but here he is understated and superb. As a legendary hard-working bulldog of a lawyer with sporadic mental breakdowns Wilkinson never comes near to the one-dimensional spitting and twitching 'crazy' person so often seen on film and as the critical player in the drama is crucial to make the story work. This film won't change the world and the story has been seen before - but that is about all I can think of as a criticism, the rest is as good as cinema should and can be.",Michael Clayton
330,whitey-98,Oscar worthy performance by Clooney,9,30 October 2007,"First off I have to say I am not the biggest George Clooney fan, however after seeing this movie and his performance I have to give credit where credit is due. We have seen this kind of movie before, what makes this one different is Clooney's performance. It was truly outstanding and is definitely Oscar worthy. Clooney's performance was not the only one worth noting, his supporting cast was outstanding as well lead by Tom Wilkinson and also had great performances by Tilda Swinton and Sydney Pollack. This movie by far is one of the best movies of the year for me so far. It's the kind of movie that takes some time to develop, but once it does its a definite knockout!",Michael Clayton
331,NewYorker76,A fine performance by all,8,22 November 2007,"I have read other comments that this film is a ""slow burner""; I would concur with this as I only realised how much I enjoyed it at the end. Having similar themes to Erin Brokovich and being another Steven Soderbergh project this was on my ""must see"" shortlist. I loved the fact that many of the main characters were morally ambiguous; it made the final outcome all the sweeter.I am a George Clooney fan (I am female after all) but lately I have felt I have seen him play Danny Ocean one too many times and I'm not just talking about the Ocean's series. He put in a really fine performance here, Clayton's inner turmoil was clear without words and for once Clooney avoided relying so heavily on his innate charm and winning trademark smile. When it finally did appear in the final scene of the film, (the brilliantly conceived taxi sequence) it was just barely discernible and wonderfully understated.Mention must also be made of Tom Wilkinson's stunning performance, likewise Tilda Swinton's. Was there anything I didn't like about the film? One too many references to Lithuanian c*** sucking for my liking, maybe they did it to achieve the higher film board rating but all it did for me was leave a nasty taste in my mouth (no pun intended).",Michael Clayton

I don't know why he got out of his car nor why it blew up but as I couldn't remember what happened in the movie I watched some more of it. I never got to see all of the movie as I switched it off, thoroughly bored with it. I cannot understand why so many people consider him 'the sexiest man alive' and other tags like this. I used to watch ER but cannot recall him, so even back then he didn't make my heart race. To me he is an aging fast, middle aged man, too full of himself.

334,marstokyo,Michael Clayton ~a sturdy thumbs up,8,13 October 2007,"Michael Clayton, starring George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton, is a taut corporate suspense thriller. Many times, with this genre the viewer is confounded by red herrings, poor editing, or just too much information. Fortunately, Michael Clayton offers none of that. The viewer is treated to a carefully thought out plot that unfolds methodically and without effort. George Clooney, in the title role, portrays a middle aged man burdened by the years of strain in his job as an attorney *fixer*. He's the one paid to clean up messes before they turn into multimillion dollar lawsuits. It's a dirty job and the soil on his hands and his heart has taken its toll. Clooney plays that burden brilliantly and with an understatement that needs nothing more than the look in those troubled eyes. Tom Wilkinson, an attorney in the throes of a mental breakdown, etches one of the finest portraits of manic depression I've seen on film. Tilda Swinton is equally strong in the role of the evil corporation's attorney, trying to make her case go away.The writing, direction, and cast are all A-one and that adds up to a highly satisfying film.",Michael Clayton
335,dnguyen1215,"Solid acting, consistent sense of intensity",8,4 March 2008,"I thought that this movie was well acted and consistently portrayed a sense of intensity throughout. One problem I had, however, was with the portrayal of one of the character's mental illness, which I found to be a bit exaggerated. Other than that, it is certainly a worthy rental, if not purchase. The plot was well arranged, and I thought that George Clooney and Colm Wilkinson worked well together. Tilda Swinton played a believable villains, plotting behind the scenes to prevent damage to her company in the main court case of the movie. George Clooney plays a calm and collected person who is pushed too far. Colm Wilkinson's character is a menially ill individual who goes off his medication, with negative consequences. The way in which Tilda Swinton's henchmen deal with him is tragic, making his death look like a suicide. Overall, this was a good film.",Michael Clayton

Events unfold and follow one another with perfect synchronicity, making complete sense. The story is entirely plausible and where you see things that are incongruous, they fit perfectly into the plot. There is a character that has bi-polar disorder and he is written to perfection and perfectly acted. There is only one scene that does not make sense, but there is a book that is referred to in the storyline with a graphic and if you accept that ""child's flight of fancy,"" that one scene makes sense. I have seen this movie many times and each time, I see something new in it. The script is excellent. The direction is excellent. The acting is first rate. This movie in my opinion is a 10.",Michael Clayton
337,pulpmaster2517,Should go down as one of the greatest films of all time,10,14 October 2007,"Michael Clayton(George Clooney) a ""fixer"" or ""janitor"" working for a very well-known law firm gets caught up in a chain of events in what is now one of my favorite films. Michael Clayton is a complex character thriller that I believe should go down as one of the greatest movies of all time. The film starts off with a voice-over of Arthur Edens(Tom Wilkinson) telling Clayton exactly how he is feeling and how the world seems to be caving in on him. While the voice over is occurring we see several different shots of a seemingly empty law firm showing phones ringing off the hook and all desks deserted. Then we see a room full of dozens of people and you know right off the bat how serious of a situation whatever is going on is. Then we see Clayton playing poker in a CHinatown sort of underground type thing he then has to leave because he gets a call from a client and is told to go see a man who is in need. While he is in the car his GPS is going haywire which ties in to the plot later. When he arrives at the house you see exactly how he handles the situation and you see exactly what kind of man this Michael Clayton is. Afterwords he drives to a place seemingly in the middle of nowhere and walks up a hill to some horses all of a sudden his car explodes from behind him the screen fades to white and the title reads ""Four Days Earlier"". We then see some more character scenes with Michael followed by Arthur Edens stripping down naked in a deposition room and Michael having to clean up the mess. When Michael learns Arthur has not been taking his pills he believes this is what caused Arthur to go insane. he tries to convince him to take the pills because ""(He is) the senior litigating partner of one of the largest, most respected law firms in the world. You are a legend."" And after a few more remarks Edens responds ""I am Sheeva the God of Death."" Which is a wonderful line because it is both funny, dramatic, and it shows you exactly what type of person Arthur Edens is. After several more events(I will not go into detail) Arthur Edens is found having seemingly committed suicide but in reality he is murdered by U-North for knowing too much and threatening to expose the truth. Michael believes there is no way his friend could have committed suicide and investigates further on his own which makes him a threat to U-North and they attempt to assassinate him as we saw in the beginning. Afterwards he confronts Karen Crowder(Tilda Swinton) the woman who is behind most of what has happened in the film and he gets her to admit everything he knows and tells her he will be silent for 10 Million Dollars. She tells him its a deal and Michael responds ""You are so f**king screwed."" Michael had a phone hidden in his pocket and the cops were listening in on the whole conversation. As Michael walks away the security of the building asks him who he is, and as a tribute to his dead friend he responds ""I'm Sheeva the God of Death"". Michael then gets in a taxi hands the driver a 50 and tells him to ""Just drive."" as the film ends. Michael Clayton is a psychological character study and a complex unique thriller all in one. It is one of the best screenplays ever written, George Clooney and Tom Wilkinson are both brilliant, the Cinematography and Editing are both gorgeous, and the music ties everything together into a near perfect thriller.",Michael Clayton
338,nandan12,Tedious. Needs some editing to shorten the duration.,6,21 October 2007,"The movie is tedious and rather slow moving in the first hour. It is hard to figure out where all of it is going. It is fragmented, so one doesn't really know which of the parallel stories to focus on. It sort of comes together in the end but it is a long wait to get there. The movie could be easily shortened by some 20 minutes to make it more watchable. In the end I would still give it a favorable assessment, because the individual performances of the actors. George Clooney is of course great, as usual, but I think Tom Wilkinson turns in a brilliant performance. Sydney Pollack is well-cast in his role as the head of the law firm hired to defend U North from this class action law suit. Tilda Swinton does a good job too.",Michael Clayton
339,tellmetales,Grows on you,7,7 January 2008,"At the end of the movie, Michael Clayton (George Clooney) hails a cab, thrusts some money at the cab driver and asks him to drive him around till the money lasts. As the credits roll, the camera focuses on Clayton's face as he sits in the cab outwardly impassive, yet for the audience who know him by now, he is obviously overwhelmed by emotion, trying to come to terms with the tumultuous events of the last few days that make up the time span chronicled in the movie. As the credits roll to a close, slowly a slight smile lights up his face as he realizes that he has done quite OK.The impact of the movie on the audience is in some ways similar to the emotions on display during that final cab ride. The movie grows on you - starting slowly, but then gradually, relentlessly tightening its grip on the audience until it culminates in a nail biting finish with the protagonist and audience both left in their seats breathless reflecting on what they have just seen.Michael Clayton works at a law firm and has a foggy job description. In the words of his boss, he is a miracle worker, in his own words, he is a janitor, called in to clean up stuff when things go inconveniently wrong at the law firm. When an important client 'hits and runs', Michael is send in to help him out. When a lawyer appears to go mad and undresses in the court room during an important hearing, Michael is flown in to clean up. His methods don't always utilize his legal skills - a character tells him ""the cops think you are a lawyer and the lawyers think you are a cop"". He is part of the system behind the scenes that allows the smooth day to day operations of the law firm. Until one day he has a choice to make - to continue to be a part of the system or to act on his own free will. We know enough about Michael to care about him - a divorcée and parent with money problems bought about by his gambling addiction and from trying to bail out relatives in financial trouble, whose career is going nowhere in spite of being very useful to his employers.The appeal of the movie lies in the fact that in spite of knowing a lot, at no point is it obvious as to what option he will choose. The movie is does not have universal appeal. I have recommended it to a few of my friends, some of whom who have come back after watching it and told me that they thought it was ""a little vague"". I, however, loved it, the highlights for me being a tight script that keeps getting tighter as the movie progresses and George Clooney who breathes life into Michael Clayton entirely convincing as a frustrated, tired failure who unexpectedly is confronted with a choice that will help him understand who he really is. Hours after the movie ended, like Michael Clayton in the back of that cab, I found myself reflecting on what I had seen and smiling to myself.",Michael Clayton
340,BillyJJack,Good over Evil - Michael Clayton is This Generation's Greek Mythology Masterpiece,10,16 July 2009,"Michael Clayton is a masterpiece.SPOILER ALERT A lot of this movie is about the horses at the beginning and the end of the movie.It was so well written, getting the protagonist out of danger or death was written in for a good reason. Being an experience prosecutor, knowing how things work, and seeing how/realizing Arthur was murdered means there were other ways Clayton could have gotten out of the car bombing.First, why let him escape? He did a good deed. In storytelling, look at the Greek classics etc, good deeds do not go unrewarded.Michael's good deed was looking after Arthur (note the name), the white knight, and starting the process to avenge his death by looking into it, resurrecting the memo to slay the dragon (uNorth). It was in all senses a mythological fight between good and evil, and Arthur knew this, relating to Michael's son with the concepts in the fantasy novel (hence the telephone call scene). Michael doesn't know this, but his role is larger than what he knows, he is effectively a representative of Mother Earth (like Perseus, son of Zeus) And just like in mythology, the fictional flying horses, that exist in Michael's son's book, existed in real life.uNorth, with its weedkiller killed off mother earth's animals and plants (Zeus's herd of flying horses), Mother earth (Zeus) sends Clayton (Perseus) in revenge.Second, Why the horses? All the flying horses were killed, except Pegasus.Michael is looking for Pegasus, trying to capture him, to carry on and slay the dragon (uNorth/Acrisius) and confront the Medusa (Crowder) Pegasus rescues Michael, and he goes on to slay Medusa (Crowder) and bring down the Dragon (Acrisius/uNorth).Perhaps Marty Bach is Zeus, guilty in a sense that Zues as father of the gods would be, not wanting to address things directly, because he knows that uNorth/Acrisius are all related as gods/players and he owes them a duty as a fellow god. I think that he is a demi god, and realizes that Clayton is like Perseus, and has a higher calling.",Michael Clayton

It was confusing and going nowhere. That said, it has been a movie that has got stuck in my head and the storyline was good, it just could have been better. I would have preferred if the irrelevant parts weren't there and the ending (although good) was tied in better, as it basically came out of nowhere. Overall, this is a movie that makes you think 'what's going on?', then when it's over you think 'what was that part about?', which I guess makes you want to see it again. I suggest renting this movie for this reason but only when you have nothing else to watch.",Michael Clayton
344,sammyd_dominatin_mc,Almost as flawed as it is engrossing and interesting,8,19 July 2008,"As with many things in the world and culture of cinema, the relative effectiveness (and therefore value) of a picture is an entirely subjective matter. Not only do judgments differ between minds, but the criteria for those judgments are diverse. Some look for a well-defined message; moral or otherwise, others posit the aesthetic (in this I include intellectual and psychological aesthetics) value of films; these people define motion pictures by the place, the critics feel, that they hold in artistic make-up of cinema. The vast majority of people however (be they high-brow, low-brow or no-brow) credit a film, whether they admit it or not, on the entertainment that it provides. Far be it from me to criticise these standards or to say which, if any, is superior. What I am here to do, if I may, is to give my two cents, as you Americans charmingly put it, on the film in question. And so, having completed my little preamble, I shall continue forthwith.Michael Clayton is an engrossing, interesting drama about morality and identity set against the backdrop of a powerful and shady law-firm in New York City. This is as opposed to the other way round; I find that most films with intellectual merit are positively afraid to admit, at least in their publicising, that their subject matter is the human condition. Those that don't are generally stodgy, uninspiring ""art""-films; the kind of pretentious tripe that ""art""-students pretend to enjoy.The acting, I should first say, is almost unreservedly superlative. The eponymous character seems to have mixed, or at least ambiguous, motivations throughout and Clooney embodies his troubled psyche marvellously. Another fine performance is brought to the screen by Tilda Swinton as the cold, corrupt but very human executive. If hats are to be tipped, however, it shall be in the direction of Tom Wilkinson whose eccentric, unstable legal-genius is a wonderful character. His opening monologue and some subsequent scenes did remind me somewhat of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. However, as the film progressed he became the most intriguing and endearing character in the film.The script and aspects of the presentation are top-notch, one begins to feel the frightening power of the legal firm as a dangerous antagonist in it's own right; forever a creepy undertone in the picture. If anything threatens all the fine efforts put into this film to a near-ruinous scale, however, is the choppy and disrupting editing. I do appreciate that this may be a projection of the nature of the action taking place and if it were applied more subtly it may well be effective. Unfortunately though, as it was, I found it jarring and off-putting. In this, I am not referring to the circular nature of the timeline (which I enjoyed) but to the ambiguity of certain scenes. One occasionally feels like something has been missed, even when playing quite close attention. This may be corrected on different cuts, I have only seen the film on the DVD released in the United Kingdom.This brings me, regrettably, to another problem area; plot holes. There is a scene, for instance, where Wilkinson's character is talking on the phone to the son of the title-character. There is no interaction between them aside from this scene and it is unclear how they came into contact. There is also a motif in the film of a certain book, which, I feel, is never entirely resolved. Again, there may be deeper reasons for this, but I still feel that, like the editing, it distracts the viewer, or at least this viewer, from the story as a whole. In fact it seems, and I may be wrong in this, that this whole aspect of the film may have played a much larger role in an earlier version of the script. If this is the case then perhaps they should have removed it entirely.As well as the above-mentioned problems, I also feel that the film would have benefited from a longer cut-time. There is a disturbing trend in film-making to cut pictures down to lengths of around one hour and a half which is a shame as many films, such as this one, could have been improved and better developed with at least another half-hour.Now, dismissing for the time being all my above statements, I should just like to say that this is undeniably a fine film. It is as an exciting and thrilling picture as one could hope for in one which is also pleasingly heady and moral. Overall, I am sad to say that I cannot entirely dismiss the flaws of the picture but I can readily admit that they do nothing to harm it's integrity. A motion picture with this many problems should warrant a rating no higher than a six or seven out of ten but the fact is that I liked it and I feel that most of these problems can be removed by more judicial editing.And so, all considered, distilled and bottled I can tell you that this film is a success, warty though it may be.",Michael Clayton

It is showing that people like Micheal Clayton have a limit. There are something that they will stop at. Who else thinks that him getting out to see the horses is his luck changing and saving him as he was on the right side. I see that many people(especially lawyers) will not like. This is like slap on many of their faces, if they have any humanity left they will consider the cases they fight. Also people will allow killings to happen but unless it comes in their faces they will also oppose it. Or will they??? No i don't cause i see many people not liking this movie, they don't see a message, they don't see that it is a very subtle exposure about how corporates are using lawyers to cover their death trail and how ruthless they really are. I feel that this movie was censored by many companies like Monsanto etc by their lobby that watches Hollywood for any mainstream movie like these. I heard the directors commentary on the DVD, I feel it took more than 6 years for him to get this movie done because initially it might have focused more on the actual case. But now the case is just a blur, but if you read between the lines carefully, you realize that the case is about a weed killer(round-up maybe :-P) poisoning waters that were killing people. I think it was edited out till it was acceptable. many people don't realize that this is movie is almost portraying reality.

It was the only film from 2007 that got more than one acting nomination at the Oscars (it got three), and a solid cast is one of the most important qualities of a film. All the main characters were nominated for Oscars for their performances, and so was the script that they were acting out, the music that was accompanying them, and the director who was directing them. And all these nominations were very much deserved by this solid gripping thriller. It really was an excellent film all around. I can't think of any flaws.

Most of the time , he looks like he needs a good night's sleep. Tilda Swinton is awesome as a character both scary and pathetic (Condi Rice, anyone?).

There are many pluses here, including some solid acting, a open-ended and complex plot that keeps you engaged, and direction which nearly always holds the tension well. The characters are multi-dimensional, complicated, even bizarre, and for the most part believable.Clooney is of course the centerpiece and is rarely off the screen. This is usually not a bad thing, and he does not disappoint here. Although he often takes on interesting roles in somewhat off-beat films, he still plays Clooney. Again, no surprises here, but he faithfully delivers. That said this is not just a Clooney vehicle - the film stands well on it's own.The direction and shooting and occasional injection of random characters and elements give the movie a real-world feel, though not in a gritty, in-yer-face way. In fact, there's a a slight lack of cohesion overall. This is a minor point, but this highlights the fact that while this is quite a good film, it does not achieve brilliance.",Michael Clayton

The depiction of darkness that isn't anything like real darkness . . . the siliiness of an employee with Michael Clayton's talents not being properly rewarded . . . just a lot of silliness and unreality from start to finish. A terrible film, because it really tried to achieve something and completely failed. In the end it doesn't matter who is involved or how much is spent or how many good lines there are if the story is based on a fantasy of how people and corporations behave. I feel sorry for the people who produced it, as it must have looked like it was worth doing. The truth is that it's emotionally dead, and phony.",Michael Clayton

Why did Micheals son phone Arthur while Arthur was in bed? The whole film is full of these scenes where you think what was that about? and because of that it gets in the way of the plot as you keep wondering when these bits of trivia will all come together. I only watched it to the end because I had to stay up and collect my daughter from a party otherwise I'd have been off to bed.

353,robsmiller,An amazing movie hindered by a style which doesn't fit most people.,9,23 February 2008,"To be honest, the only reason I gave Michael Clayton a 9/10 is because this film is obviously (As previously stated in other user comments) not for every movie-goer. The trailer sometimes shows it to be a bit more action filled than it really is, which threw a lot of people off when viewing this title.The acting was tremendous to be blunt. George Clooney was simply amazing in his role which entailed a troubled worker, a sometimes ignorant yet loving father and a normal business owner trying to make it through the steps of setting up a small bar. Tom Wilkinson... he was amazing. There's really nothing more to be said.The filming was effective and simple. It gave good glimpses at key elements in the story, caught each actor's emotions at any given time of anxiety, distress, relief or anger.The screenplay was damn good, giving you enough evidence at the start to justify displaying Wilkinson as a mentally ill man and yet it twists your thoughts and emotions toward the end of the movie.I won't give anything away, but the ending scene was one of the most powerful scenes in a movie I've ever seen. Many will leave because the credits start rolling, but I assure you the show goes on until the last second of film time.This is my second time viewing this movie, this time on Blu-Ray and the first on the opening day in theaters. I was one of those that expected it to be an action movie, so I was caught off-guard halfway through the movie and had to pick up the story piece by piece from what I could remember clearly. This time was a lot clearer for me and I was able to connect the story together with ease.Overall an amazing movie only hindered by the fact that the trailer may seem a bit misleading. If you watch this movie, don't expect an action movie. Expect to be cast into deep thought by the end of the film.",Michael Clayton

Now, i'm not saying it's bad, i'm saying that it is the most boring movie that i've ever watched in my entire life. And I like philosophical and slow movies...

I have just get amazed with the screen play and directing work of Tony Gilroy. He was the main player in this movie to give it a good reputation.

Watching Mr. Pollack act in this film in 2007 makes me wonder why he stopped directing. However ""3 days"" was a better film even as dated as it is, there is an aura in it not evident here with M.Clayton. It feels like you've seen this idea before but the twists have changed. Sorry, I don't feel the suspense. I recognize the stellar cast, but that alone cannot carry the show. Clooney is a very good actor, but facial or bodily mannerisms cannot fill the void for a flawed work.

The title does not say much at first sight and the thought of seeing another ""lawyer"" movie was not that enticing but...at the end of day, this was an Excellent flick with a plot loaded with less than obvious twists. It provides a credible portrayal of large corporate litigation and the issues that are at stake and asks the question - what would you do if faced with a true moral quandary? succumb to temptation and greed or take the moral high road? - without coming up with cheesy, obvious answers.The characters are well developed and interesting across the board. The moral choices that they confront are not over-done and are well presented.

It's the fact that he decided to forgo all that he has been and go up against big bad corporation. Oh right right, let spend another 2 minutes on that.Sorry folks, Michael Clayton has an extremely mediocre plot. If you were looking for something on the lines of John Grisham or any one of those 'going against the corporation' movies, Michael Clayton is not for you. Once Mr. Clayton gets his hands on a memo very conveniently signed by every bigwig of the company how does he get back at them? He gets the cops to listen in when he gets the completely unaware lady lawyer to own up. I mean seriously, is this the best you can do? Lex Luthor trying to become a real estate broker was a better plot than that. Tilda Swinton's performance as an 'unsure' legal head is worth a watch though and so is Tom Wilkinson's on-the-edge act.

359,mbelmont-1,Michael Clayton deserving of Oscar nominations,10,29 January 2008,"Michael Clayton is one of those movies that's good enough to seem like it's not a movie. A subtle and slow but ultimately rewarding script allows it to unfold with uncommon grace, and we leave the theater with entertainment in hand and something to think about.On the surface it's merely a particularly well-done legal/corporate thriller, but underneath it's a story about mundane and ostensibly reasonable decisions that can accumulate over a lifetime to put people in situations they never wanted to be in. When Michael Clayton pulls his car over to tell something important to his son, he's imploring him to be good enough to make the right calls as he grows up.Clooney is good, but Wilkinson and Swinton are the film's dramatic stars as the crazed but righteous lawyer and the determined but twitchy corporate villain.Out of the nominees, this one probably deserves the best picture Oscar.",Michael Clayton

To say honestly, after watching the whole movie my opinion was to change. The film is surely not for all but this actually attracts me. The plot is untwisting as the clew of threads - and just collected all facts, in the end we understand the essence of things. It's similar to classic Hollywood detectives of past century, and together with the play by brilliant George Clooney, the film makes watchers not indifferent, especially those who have seen the film up to the end.",Michael Clayton

Hey, Bad Day At Black Rock was my first experience seeing karati and was breathtaking, I'll never forget it! Now, with digital imaging, all the martial art exhibitions to which we're exposed are just more ho-hum, been there, done that.I need not bore you with a repetition of the story line, just want to say this movie is superb.

There is big mistake though (SPOILER AHEAD), because the thugs (according to their motive) would have never used a car bomb in trying to kill Clayton (Clooney). They simply would have mugged him and left him dead. Maybe the idea of a car bomb is useful for the suspense of the film, as Clayton also has gambling debts with mobsters, who would indeed have used this method (had they wanted to kill him), as a means of showing to their community their means and ways of doing business.

Go here: http://www.script-o-rama.com/table3.shtml, and see how a truly gifted scriptwriter is able to paint entire scenes for us with just a few well-chosen words. Tony Gilroy has truly set the bar for excellence in scriptwriting with MICHAEL CLAYTON. George Clooney is perfect in the role of Michael, a lost soul in mid-career crisis. As we probably expected at the beginning of the film, his conscience wins out, and he ""does the right thing"" at the end of the movie. HOW he does it is what makes this film such compelling viewing. However reading the script is where the real fun comes in. Gilroy's concise use of words... how brilliantly he portrayed action and settings and characters... that's the true beauty of MICHAEL CLAYTON. I strongly urge anyone who has seen this film to also read the script. Tony Gilroy is an amazingly talented writer. Hats off to him!",Michael Clayton
364,elfdorado,A fine film with some wretched flaws,7,22 September 2011,"The screenplay: Some of the writing is the best I've ever heard. Arthur's dialogue in particular is a real standout. And Michael's son is actually given real form and comes out looking like a real child with thoughts he wants to share with a father he doesn't get to see often enough.The performances: These are amazing. Tom Wilkinson gets the show-stopping role, but Tilda Swinton is superb, and the script gives her character the best opportunity to show itself and build. George Clooney is at his best, his performance doing a great job of trying to gloss over the mistakes in how his character is drawn.The cinematography: Generally very satisfying, the color and exposure are fine, but sometimes the composition (and even number) of the shots leaves a little to be desired, and a couple of times there are some amateurish focus problems.All this being said, there are some glaring errors that make one really wonder how stupid either the audience or the characters are supposed to be.For instance, why would Michael open a BAR with his alcoholic and longtime ne'er-do-well brother and then be surprised when Timmy falls off the wagon and runs the bar into the ground? Why would he have sunk his entire nest egg into a venture destined to be a failure? His desperation is key to the plot and to his character, but couldn't something more credible have been conceived? Why would Michael be so naive as to think that no one could be spying on him or aiming to do him harm after he hears Anna's talk about Arthur's affect in his final hours, which would rule out suicide? Why wouldn't he be more on guard after reading Memorandum #229? He knows how large the lawsuit is: $6 billion! Isn't it possible that a corporation, or certain people within it, would authorize a murder or two to avert a payout that large, publicity that bad, and the death of a very profitable product? After all, the case had been going for six long years, with all the attendant fees. Considering Michael's job---fixing a whole host and range of very sticky situations---how could he not see the enormity of the stakes and take a few routine precautions? The idea that Arthur would go off his meds when clarity, stability, and reputation are most crucially needed to see his plans to expose u*north come to fruition is completely absurd. Yes, his semi-manic state allows him to be a newfangled Howard Beale who thankfully has no boardroom conversation with Ned Beatty---but Arthur is a man who has always had to do serious thinking, whereas Howard Beale is, as a network anchor, not much more than a condenser of information and spokesman. That being said, Arthur's naivety about what might happen to him makes more sense, since a person during mania so often feels omnipotent and invincible.Another jaw-dropping flaw is the method of killing Michael. Arthur's death is so meticulously designed to look like a suicide, the scene so well-staged, the care taken to leave no evidence behind so fastidious. But using a car bomb to try to kill Michael immediately raises so many red flags and leaves behind enough evidence to ensure investigation and possible arrest. Because they have been using GPS to track Michael, the killers must also know that Michael's car is parked, but they don't consider that Michael might have gotten out of the car. (Although Michael's attempt to convince the police that he'd actually been killed by throwing a few personal effects into his burning car seems laughable on its face, it makes sense when you consider Michael's desperation in the face of what's just happened. It's remarkable that he even thought to do what he did, and the fact is that, with the connections he has in the NYC police force---and who knows who else---he could have told the police what happened and then come up with the plan he executes so well in the final scene.) So my fairly high rating of the film is based on often stunningly well-written dialogue and the quality of the acting. I have to admit it was entertaining as well.",Michael Clayton

The technique of the director Luc Besson in this film is flawless. The way its filmed is so well thought that not even John Grisham can argue this film surpasses any of the efforts others have made to make a story of this genre so invigorating. The cast is tremendous, they are so committed with their characters, you get the feel as if they were locked down in a chamber with four walls for ten years and let them out. This a journey for all of the characters. A journey of trust,or lack of trust, a search within of what it is pure, a search for whatever truth is left in their empty lives. They have been working hard, striving towards greatness in their profession, yet they have come to find themselves empty, life has given them nothing in return, or so they think. This is the film you've waiting for, this is the movie you watch time and time again, not because it's the most entertaining or personally fulfilling, but because anyone that appreciates what is behind a production, will understand immediately that this is not just any film; This is Clooney, Swinton and Wilkinson, milking every last drop of beauty in modern cinema.",Michael Clayton

The story line is a good one, but I feel that Clooney is miscast in the lead role. I was surprised that Tilda Swinton's role is so small in the film, it's an absolute wonder that she won the Oscar. Not saying of course, that she is not a really good actress, but I don't think the role that she portrays in this film warrants an Oscar.The film runs at an incredibly slow pace, characters are introduced seemingly at random with hardly any characterisation or background. it's not easy to understand who is who or what relation they all are to the plot. George Clooney's character is supposedly a hard-man fixer for this major New York law firm, but we see him taking a small child to school! We see a softer side to him that does not sit well with his role. It may be the character, it may be Clooney, but I just just don't think he's suited for this kind of characterisation.Overall I feel that the film was about 40 minutes too long. I can't put my finger on it but it just lacks cohesion. This of course, is not saying it Solaris. That was a complete stinker by Clooney. It's just that his way of acting really doesn't sit with the character that he was supposed to be portraying.I can see how some people will like this film.

Tilda Swinton is brilliant , as is Tom Wilkinson. And of course lifer Sydney Pollack gives a great performance, as he always does. Good cast, good story and over all a very watchable film. I wish good comedies were as easy to make as a good drama.This movie must be referenced as a good example of how to use a stacked cast to full effect.Even though Clooney is the star, he hardly steals the show and I found myself enjoying every scene with the co-stars.

It's not a big story, and the ending feels rushed and somewhat simple, but the acting is beautifully small (and the film smugly shoves your face in it during the credits) and the dialogues (even some unnecessary ones, such as one between Clooney and his son) are genuinely great.Thought-provoking.",Michael Clayton
376,gerfalcon7-1,The mythic substratum of Michael Clayton,9,24 March 2008,"As usual-and this is not to say I'm so astute or anything-but as usual nobody seems to get 'it.' In this regard, I'll just be brief. And the 'it' that nobody gets is the correspondences that exist in the style, structure, and story in this film and its mythic, religious implications. Let's take the premise, if you will, that an artist (in whatever medium) in creating a work of art, is intentional about what he/she does. In other words, everything has a point, even if you don't get the point. That said, the journey that Michael Clayton will go on is obvious with the first 5 minutes of the film, and that's the ONLY spoiler I'll mention because I don't have time or desire to deconstruct the whole film at the moment. OK, we begin with a babbling voice-over monologue of a man in distress, describing some weird situation where he describes a literally visceral experience. It has to do with describing a woman in after birth with descriptions of embryo, placenta, blood, and the like. To counterpoint this very 'organic' monologue (by the way, the writer/director was a playwright at one time), we see still shots of the corridors of power: board rooms, corporate corridors, geometric sterile interiors and cityscapes. Everything is synthetic, inert, external. So here we have a ranting man describing the literal internal parts of a woman with the exoskeletal culture of corporate power. Michael Clayton is going to maneuver through these realms. Now, what story in the Bible has an average guy suddenly thrust into the 'bowels' of a living, mysterious creature? Why is it ironic that one of the 'grossest' tales in the Bible is all about experiencing the very basic nature of biological processes? Michael Clayton is that guy all over again, but the animal has changed. Like it, don't like it, whatever. At least you should understand what you're watching.",Michael Clayton

The son's book could have been very interesting and a segue for Edens mad plan. Edens did write in the margins of the book--I was dying to read what he had written...I saw horses by a tree in the book, but no connection did the picture have with the event with Clayton and the bridled horses on the hill. If the horses on the hill were to be a metaphor for freedom, I don't think they would have been bridled. And owners do not leave horses in their bridles AND the horses were not in a fenced area. At first I thought the scene with the horses symbolized Clayton's past--a past lost from gambling debts-- but then I remembered he was from more of a working class background--that area was a very wealthy community. Edens murder was so professional minus the fact that it could not be attributed to pills which was the intent of the killers. Clayton's idea to put his watch, wallet, etc. in the fire was insane. Even the hit men would be looking for human remains--bones. Would Crowder have been so glib with Clayton at the end? She spoke in hieroglyphics to her trusted cohorts.

The bad guys were cartoonish. I can't find anything about this film that I liked.. A total waste of two hour and seven bucks. At least I took a short nap, but I know I didn't miss anything because nothing happens. Then the big dramatic finish which isn't. How many ways can Clooney try to look cute. I don't care to see a Clooney movie anymore. This movie was an embarrassment. It made my skin crawl.",Michael Clayton
382,linnyc-1,"""Michael Clayton"" question",9,16 November 2007,"I think this is a superbly written adult film with wonderful performances from all. Didn't recognize Michael O'Keefe. The cinematography added much to the suspense and mystery of the film. What other film star, male or female, could pull off a performance like George Clooney and have us forget who he is and be so drawn to his utterly believable character.When Tilda (lawyer,Karen) called the hit men, what was her answer when the person she called asked how she got his number. I could not hear who she got the number from. Was it her boss Don Jeffries? Thanks.",Michael Clayton
383,anthonystuckey,(1) Awful,1,8 March 2008,"This movie was awful. There is no coherent time line, without which none of the scenes make much sense at all. Almost nothing can be deduced of the motivations of any of the characters. After the hit-and-run, does Clooney *know* anything? Or is he just bumbling about? Nothing at all is ever known about why Karen Crowder does anything she does. Are the rehearsal and bathroom scenes meant to show that she's in over her head? Or is she as much of a mole as Arthur Edens? Put together into a coherent time line, this movie might manage to show something worth seeing. Right now, it shows little and tells nothing.",Michael Clayton
384,motazerker,Dull and Boring,2,1 March 2008,"This movie is supposed to be a suspenseful thriller, but there is no suspense or thrill. The only good slash remotely clever part of this movie is the whole ""I Am Shiva, the God of Death"" thing thats it!!!!! HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!! but hey, at least the acting is OK. The story is all over the place. How would people think he was dead if there was no bones in the car. Michael Clayton does not do much in the film, he does not accomplish much. Then he is wearing a wire WOW! that was true genius how many movies have they done that before? Then at the end of he rides off in the cab how LAME!!!!!!!! Don't watch this movie it is awful!",Michael Clayton
385,yaelal,good movie with identity problems,7,9 March 2008,"First of all it's a good movie. It's main problem, in my opinion, is that it shouldn't look like an action movie. The beginning is misleading. When you start with a car bomb ppl expect to see fireworks. I saw this movie with 5 other ppl who refused to see it after about 40 minutes. I had to see the rest of it alone. The movie is a bit all over the place, with the work problems, the kid, the brothers, the money, the restaurant and the gambling, it's hard to see where it's going and what's the point. Maybe they should have started with the life background and move to the work problems as the main issue. And not start with a bomb and then add all the little bits and pieces, in what seems like random places. That makes the movie seems long and boring. Which is why the 5 ppl refused to watch it... To sum it up, it's a good movie if you have patience If not, don't bother",Michael Clayton
386,zeira,Completely confusing,1,29 November 2008,"I rented this movie, luckily, because after one hour of watching it I had to give up, since I couldn't understand what was going on. CTV in Canada has a documentary similar to 60 minutes called W-FIVE, Its name comes from the five words: what? where? who? why? when? (mot in this particular order, question marks added by myself). I couldn't answer none of the five above questions watching this movie . . . I like this type of movie, but it has to be understandable, at least after about half hour of watching. My wife kept watching it and liked it a lot. But she couldn't convince me to watch the rest of it later today or tomorrow. It's not the actors' fault, it's the screenplay . . .",Michael Clayton
387,wsherrett10,Plausibility problems,7,8 August 2010,"I am always bothered by implausible plot devices, especially when the story hinges on them, which is a sign that the writer got lazy in the final stages. This happens increasingly these days. Here, the company's attempt to kill Michael is the peak of the action. First, there is no need to hard-wire the bomb inside his car, a cell phone bomb could be slipped under the seat quite easily. This was necessary to set up the unsuccessful explosion, after which Michael tosses his wallet and ring, or something, inside the burning car. And this was to accomplish what, again? Without a burned body, it's obvious that there was no fatality. Nonetheless, the story progresses as if this ruse was successful. It ruined for me what is otherwise a fine thriller.",Michael Clayton
388,ThimbleDude,Gilroy does wonders in directorial debut,8,21 September 2007,"Gilroy impresses in his directorial debut, a slick procedural that has a whole lot of tension and suspense. Wilkinson is really good, and if the film does well, he could see some Oscar buzz in the coming months (the speech that opens up the film is unbelievable. The way this guy transforms himself movie to movie is amazing). Swinton also turns in a great performance. With several quiet scenes (and several talking-in-front-of-a-mirror scenes), she totally nails down her character's motivation and the fear she has inside. And in the end, it's Clooney who holds this film together with a superb central performance. He gets a nice back-story and has a great arc. It's definitely one of the better films of the year so far.",Michael Clayton
389,rbnrnnr,Holds up over time,8,7 November 2021,"I love this movie - I have watched it many times, most recently last night. It has one of the best collections of superb performances you'll find, wrapped in an anti-corporate Erin Brokovich-like story structure. But what's really going on is the individual characters. George Clooney is so under rated. He has a clear understanding of his role at his firm - he's a fixer, a janitor. But he's really good at it and it's allowed him to fund his other hobbies. The interaction between him and his brother is so subtle New York class structure: brother's a cop so sees his brother as a fancy lawyer; Clooney's coworkers know his background and see him as a cop. Tom Wilkinson is incredible. Lead attorney at the firm, leading their defense of their client, a giant ag company accused of poisoning people. A non-showy naturalistic performance showing someone going off their medication. Or is he just waking up and deciding not to sell his soul anymore? It's a Peter Finch/Network level performance, I kid you not. And finally, my girl Tilda Swinton. She is never ever boring. She is ostensibly the face of the villain in this story. And yet Tilda does something really interesting here. She allows you inside this character's job in a male-dominated corporation, in an awful industry, you understand her ambition, but she lets you see how over her head she feels she is. She makes her character's anxiety palpable. And yet, when the inevitable confrontation happens: she deserves it. You get the feeling, though, that had she been smarter and stronger, the men she works for would never have allowed her to be around. So ultimately they did this to themselves. Finally, the elegant plot structure. You begin near the end, go back to the beginning, and then go past where you started to the end. ""I am Siva, the god of death""",Michael Clayton
390,Ruben-51,he may have a slight case of Oedipus syndrome,8,24 October 2007,"The aspirations of story tellers to write the Great American Novel have given way to doing the Great American Film. Unfortunately film making is not a solo activity so it's difficult to ascribe subliminal messages to the lead actor even if he or she is also one of the producers, but we are all attracted to certain projects even if we never ask ourselves why. The White Horse on the Hill scene in ""Michale Clayton"" may tell us why Clooney has lent his support to make movies like this and Syriana but the next to last scene makes you wonder if he may have a slight case of Oedipus syndrome. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he suggested a female for the heavy early on. Of course he and Tony Gilroy (Proof of Life, The Devil's Advocate) may share some the same formative relationships with dominant women. If you like reading Camus or enjoy films with a social message hidden in a tableau of current events, you'll like this one, even if they did have to blow up the Mercedes used in The Devil Wears Prada to have something for the trailers.",Michael Clayton
391,sodammtuff,Fantastic!!!,9,28 January 2008,"I was lucky enough to see a screener copy of this in my own home.This is unequivocally a thriller for adults. A deftly written, tautly suspenseful and intellectually demanding morality tale, it stays a step ahead of the audience and features multidimensional characters played by actors at the top of their games. The pace and style harks back to such classics of the '70s as All the President's Men or Network.A must see!!!Clayton may be Clooney's best role in a body of work that is increasingly assured. Wilkinson is just as convincing as a brilliant but unhinged legal mind, with an innocence that leads to an epiphany, the nature of which he tries to articulate in his opening speech. The film is written and stylishly directed by first-timer Tony Gilroy, the screenwriter behind the razor-sharp Bourne movies. Although a key plot point is revealed early, it serves to heighten our fascination with the story. A climactic confrontation between Swinton and Clooney is one of the most satisfying moments in a film bristling with fierce intensity.",Michael Clayton
392,nmwolfpack,Lacking,5,14 November 2020,Very slow and lacking character detail. You also spend a good portion of the movie just watching a series of events that seemed disjointed no flow. Didn't feel invested at all. Last 15 minutes was good. Getting to that point was tough. Movie took place over 4 days but it seemed like 10 days,Michael Clayton
393,Rusty_Leone,10/10 for yuppies,4,7 October 2007,"The film whilst cinematically told (which is a nice change for once) is done at such a slow and mundane pace that it just seems like filler. People are hailing this as a masterpiece, yet they seem to forget that this is just a very slow and simple story that has been told various times in other films to a much better effect. So slow is the pace that when you have the background credit filler of static shot of someone sitting in the back of a taxi for 5 minutes, everyone in the cinema thought that the film was still going.No doubt Clooney will get an Oscar nod for 'most drawn out shots of a man walking in a film', and the slow length has and will get various people thinking that it is intelligent and classy. And before people say the defence ""You didn't understand the film"", Well really I ask what is there to NOT understand? This was just such a basic story that could have been told in half the time and in a much more interesting way. I found no tension in the film at all, which wasn't helped by showing part of the ending at the start of the film. Then I had the boredom of the director trying to make us care for what really are 1D character's, before winding slowly up to the ending which is predicable and clichéd at best.Michael Clayton - The best example of how to stretch a simple plot out for 2 hours and appear intelligent.",Michael Clayton

397,Hobblet2005,Waste of Time,3,7 March 2008,"I was really excited to see this movie. I saw the awards shows and critics hail this movie as the best thriller of the year. Boy were they wrong. I would like to know how much the producers paid off the critics to give this movie good reviews. This movie was a complete waste of my time. It plods along in its own little Grey world of clichés. The only thing this movie has going for it is George Clooney's performance. Clooney manages to some-how pull off the cliché conflicted character very well. Other than that, this movie is nothing more than a bore. I want my two hours back to watch a better movie. If you want to watch a real great movie from 2007, pick up American Gangster.",Michael Clayton
