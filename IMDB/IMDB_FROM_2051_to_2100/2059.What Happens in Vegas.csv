0,SnoopyStyle,Really stupid turn destroys uninspired comedy,4,26 April 2014,"Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) is a commodities trader in a relationship with Mason (Jason Sudeikis). However her surprise birthday party backfires when Mason breaks up with her. Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is constantly goofing off in the family business and his dad (Treat Williams) fires him. They both try to get away and Vegas! She's with her friend Tipper (Lake Bell), and he's with Hater (Rob Corddry). However a computer error puts the two groups in the same room. After being accused of being too uptight, she parties it up with the guys and Joy finds herself married to Jack. When they win a jackpot of $3M, the judge (Dennis Miller) orders them to stay together for 6 months.It starts off well as a simple rom-com. Diaz and Kutcher are both perfectly fine rom-com material. Lake Bell and Rob Corddry are funny inappropriate sidekicks. Everything is going fine if somewhat uninspired. I especially like the inherit hatred of Hater by Tipper. Once the stupid judgment happens, the movie starts to crash and burn. It just gets stupider and stupider. It turns insanely annoying. Both characters are left with no salvaging likeablility. I actually wish for a murder suicide for these two characters.",What Happens in Vegas
1,claudio_carvalho,Delightful Silliness,8,22 August 2008,"The clumsy and reckless Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is fired by his boss and father (Treat Williams) and together with his friend and unsuccessful lawyer Hater (Rob Corddry), they decide to go to Las Vegas to have a good time. Meanwhile the fiancé of the workaholic stock broker Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) breaks up their engagement because of her lack of attitude. Her friend and bartender Tipper (Lake Bell) convinces Joy to spend a couple of days also in Las Vegas. Due to a hotel management mistake, they are lodged in the same room and later they hang around together. During the night, they get completely wasted and on the next morning, Jack and Joy find that they got married. While discussing to briefly end their wedding, Jack borrows a coin from Joy to gamble in the jackpot machine and wins three million dollars. They question in court the ownership of the money and the conservative Judge R. D. Whopper (Dennis Miller) freezes the money and sentence them to live together with Joy moving to Jack's house for six months and attending regular counseling sessions. Each one decides to make the life of the other hell on Earth to force to get out of the marriage.""What Happens in Vegas"" is silly, but one of the most delightful romantic comedies I have recently seen. There are many hilarious scenes that made me laugh a lot in my flight; the gorgeous, sexy and funny Cameron Diaz shows a wonderful chemistry with Ashton Kutcher that performs his traditional role of a goofy guy. My only remark is that it is hard to believe that a man could resist the charm of Cameron Diaz living together with her. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Jogo de Amor em Las Vegas"" (""Game of Love in Las Vegas"")",What Happens in Vegas
2,kosmasp,Decent effort,5,12 August 2008,"Not anything new, nothing really special, but decent performances, nice story (telling), everything a feel good movie (=comedy) kind of has to have! The main selling point for this, are the two main actors. Ashton and Cameron play opposite characters, which of course draws a lot of potential fun into the script. While you might feel, that one of the two might be the person who is right in the argument their having, this is not the point (as it isn't where this all leads to, you have that figured out, before the movie starts). It's about having a silly fun time. Let loose and enjoy even the ridiculous moments. Not because the actors had fun doing the movie (that fact is not helping you having fun now does it?), but because the movie delivers exactly what it promises. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less either!",What Happens in Vegas
3,jboothmillard,What Happens in Vegas,3,19 October 2011,"You know the classic catchphrase about the place they call Sin City, ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"", my only nag about a good title is that this should be a story all set in the gambling capital of the world, but then again there are more nags than that, from director Tom Vaughan (Starter for 10). Basically stockbroker Joy McNally (Razzie nominated Cameron Diaz) is dumped by her boyfriend and fiancé on the night of his birthday where many friends had gathered to surprise him, and at the same time carpenter Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is fired by his father Jack Sr. (Treat Williams) from his job. Joy with her friend, bartender Tipper (Lake Bell), and Jack with his friend, District Attorney/lawyer Hater (Hot Tub Time Machine's Rob Corddry), they all decide to get away from things by heading to Las Vegas, and that is where the two meet and from a computer error end up in the same room. When the mix up is sorted, getting upgraded rooms and coupons, they decide to hang out together gambling, partying and drinking in various clubs, and the next morning is when they realise that they got married. They want an immediate divorce from each other, but before they part Jack uses a quarter that Joy gave him on a slot machine, and he hits the three million dollar jackpot, and she realises she is entitled to half the money in their separation. Their attempt to divorce though is unsuccessful because Judge Whopper (Dennis Miller) does not feel there is enough evidence to show their marriage was a mistake, so he orders them to live together for six months and try to be a real wedded couple, while also attending marriage counselling with Dr. Twitchell (Queen Latifah). If they try to work things out but still in six months want a divorce they will be allowed to split the fortune, otherwise the money will be tied up in litigation. Joy and Jack as the newlyweds know that if they can stick out the six months they will get their share of the money, i.e. $1.5 million each, but of course during this time they are trying to outdo each other with infuriating habits. There is also a point when they both come up with the plan that if they cheat on the other then they would be allowed a divorce much quicker, of course both come up with this scheme at the same time and see each other's true colours. Slowly though as Joy and Jack are forced to stay with each other during their time they may be forming a real attraction for each other, and besides having a couple of real married couple arguments that Dr. Twitchell is noticing, they may be finding a mutual understanding. As the final day and court hearing approaches, Joy unexpectedly has ex fiancé Mason (Hall Pass's Jason Sudeikis) asking for her back, proposing once again, to which she doesn't accept, and she finds out Jack set this up. There is discussion that they truly did try to make things work, so they would split the money, taking away taxes and bills, evenly, but Joy decides she doesn't want money or anything from Jack anymore, he gets all the money, but he knows she talked to Mason. She even denies a promotion she had been working a long time for, and quits her job disappearing with no-one knowing where she is, Jack realises his big mistake and goes in search of her, he finds her where she said is the only place that makes her happy. Jack asks Joy to be his wife again having truly fallen in love with her, she says yes but is concerned that having quit her job she won't won't know what to do, he reminds her they have three million dollars, and they live happily married ever after, we also get to see their original drunken wedding in Las Vegas. Also starring Dennis Farina as Richard Banger, Deirdre O'Connell as Judy Fuller, The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis as Dave the Bear and Yogi Bear's Andrew Daly as Curtis. Diaz may be beautiful, but as the control freak easily angered it is hard to find her the best female lead, and Kutcher I have always though is not the most reliable actor, in their scenes together there is the smallest amount of chemistry, but the story is predictable with a couple originally hating each other eventually falling in love, and there are not enough good laughs, so it is a rather disappointing romantic comedy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screen Couple for Diaz and Kutcher. Adequate!",What Happens in Vegas
4,edwagreen,What Happens in Vegas Shouldn't Happen to You **,4,4 January 2010,"Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz may ultimately hit it off but unfortunately the picture doesn't.After they are dumped by her boss and his dad firing him, the two meet in Vegas and get so drunk, they get married while hitting a $3 million dollar lottery prize in a casino. The last time I saw 2 drunks get married, that was in ""I'll Cry Tomorrow,"" (1955) but that was totally a different story.The bulk of the story is about how the two literally try to destroy each other so that each can come away with all that money. Queen Latifah is a marriage counselor who knows nonsense when she sees it. Dennis Farina, as Cruz's boss, is his usual forward self as he takes Kushton's criticism in jest. Treat Williams is reduced to a bit part as Kutcher's father. Williams tries to be serious when he fires his own son, but this is just not Treat's things.The ending is obvious because we know that love conquers all.",What Happens in Vegas
5,studioAT,Weak rom-com,2,7 October 2017,"In Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz you have two stars who can make this sort of romantic comedy in their sleep. They also bring such likability that it can paper over the cracks if perhaps the script or the characters are lacking a bit.However both these factors cannot save the fact that this is a dud film, that produces very few laughs, and wastes its stars.I cannot recommend it.",What Happens in Vegas
6,jotix100,...Stays in Vegas,4,3 July 2009,"One could question the executives of Twentieth Century Fox about their entertainment acumen when they gave their green light to have this project become a feature film. ""What Happens in Vegas"" creators stole, whether consciously, or not, material from better made movies, even a more recent episode of ""Friends"", to make this comedy that unfortunately doesn't go anywhere.Never have two leading performers been so mismatched as Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher in this movie. They feel uncomfortable with one another and have no chemistry in scenes where it was required. The premise feels phony from the start. Sorry, but it's hard to believe with a quarter bet on the slot machine one can win three million dollars. Talk about getting lucky! The best thing in the film is Rob Coddry, who is seen as Hater, the lead's best friend and Lake Bell who is her girlfriend. Queen Latifah does what she can with such thin material. Dennis Miller has a small part as a judge.Director Tom Vaughn, who comes from doing a lot of television work, was not a good choice for bringing this ill timed comedy to fruit. For that matter, the screen treatment by Dana Fox doesn't ring true either.",What Happens in Vegas
7,dbborroughs,The end and Dennis Miller belong in a better movie,3,14 May 2008,"Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz meet cute in Vegas and after a night of drinking marry, they also win a jackpot of several million before deciding to get a divorce with both wanting ownership of the cash. Unfortunately they end up in front of Judge Dennis Miller who sentences them to 6 months of marriage before he will even consider granting them a divorce and threatening to tie them up in litigation so long it depletes their fortune. Okay romantic comedy that wants to be more than it is. Much of the early stuff didn't really work for me with the film only springing to life when Dennis Miller showed up. What really annoyed me was that the final scenes of the film where they both realize what they want had the film blossoming into something that was actually quite wonderful. I would have loved to have seen a whole film like that instead of the silliness that preceded it.",What Happens in Vegas
8,anaconda-40658,Diaz Happens in Vegas.,8,5 June 2015,"What Happens in Vegas (2008): Dir: Tom Vaughn / Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Cameron Diaz, Rob Corddry, Lake Bell, Dennis Miller: The city of lights becomes the happening for Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz who meet in Vegas and end up married after a drunken evening. Divorce court follows but the issue regards the jackpot he scored on her coin. Starts out fine but becomes predictable. The ending works due to a selfless act. Director Tom Vaughn is backed with great Vegas locations fuelled with the energy reputed with the city. Kutcher plays off the irresponsible nature of someone not easily caring but will learn that selfishness isn't an asset to relationships. Diaz was dumped by her fiancé yet displays total selflessness that render the film worth the trip. Both will bicker and one-up each other in the meantime. Rob Corddry as Kutcher's best friend and lawyer plays above conventions and steals scenes with his crass beliefs and hilarious advice. Lake Bell as Diaz's best friend is unfortunately flat and never highlighted as Corddry successfully portrays himself. Dennis Miller is also wasted as a judge that lands down the plot problem. Fans of romantic comedies will no doubt indulge in this venture to Vegas thanks to the two leads. It presents marriage is a team ordeal where love and sacrifice go beyond anything that happens in Vegas. Score: 8 ½ / 10",What Happens in Vegas
9,HotToastyRag,Silly fluff,2,20 November 2020,"Given that I don't normally like Cameron Diaz and I can never stand Ashton Kutcher, I'm not the target audience for the romantic comedy What Happens in Vegas. I watched it for Queen Latifah, but she doesn't have so big of a part that I could block out the rest of the film.Cameron and Ashton meet in Las Vegas and after a drunken night of debauchery, they wake up wearing wedding rings. Of course, they immediately want a divorce, but the judge won't grant one. Judge Dennis Miller is a romantic at heart (or just wants to teach them a lesson) and insists they go to couples' counseling and live together for six months before refiling suit. That's where Queen Latifah comes in; she's the marriage counselor.Even with a supporting cast of Krysten Ritter, Jason Sudeikis, Lake Bell, Rob Corddry, Zach Galifianakis, and Treat Williams, I didn't enjoy this movie. It's just another light piece of fluff, and it won't harm you if you want to rent it, but it's a good idea to root for the leads. I just can't bring myself to ever root for Ashton Kutcher. Just look at the promotional poster, for goodness sake - why is he pointing?",What Happens in Vegas
10,mm-39,D*** good movie,8,5 June 2008,"I really like this film. Comedy is hard to preform. What I like about ""What happens in Vegas"" is the irony humor. How a perfect gal, and a by the seat of his pants guy use their worst traits to get along. They need each other for the couple's bad traits balance each other out. One learns to let go in life, and the other learns to start trying. The humor of extremes is great. I like the party scene. People just go the extremes. 8 out 10 laughs for this one. Go see What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas at the movie theater. My wife loved this movie. A good pizza movie night. Buy the DVD! I hope they never make part 2.

11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: What Happens In Vegas,6,7 May 2008,"My only trip to the US (not counting the toddler days) where I can remember what the heck I was doing, was back in December 2005 (gee, time flies!) where I spent a total of 7 full days trawling the streets as well as the casinos up and down the Strip and its outskirts, and seriously, it's never as sexy as that portrayed in the movies (or that television series), though you'd truly never really run out of things to do, despite everything being overly expensive at tourist prices. I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!And of course, Vegas is famous amongst other things besides the Elvis impersonators, live entertainment etc, is the ability to conduct quicky marriages, which is what Ashton Kutcher's Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz's Joy McNally get themselves into during a night of drunken stupor and cheap dares, two lonely souls who journey to Sin City as an escapism from their failed lives, where you can enjoy all the pleasures the city have to offer, before the drudge comes kicking in when you receive that credit card bill.So begins the story when the duo find themselves in a situation to annul their marriage given a night of impulse that they cannot remember, but cannot do so when McNally's quarter was inserted into a jackpot machine by Fuller, and that brought them a cool 3 million dollars jackpot. Which they can't agree how to split the money, and a quirky judge sentenced them to 6 months ""hard marriage"" to work through their marital vows, before their frozen cash can be touched. As what the trailer had already explicitly spelt out, it's War of the Roses in Mr and Mrs Smith styled couch-therapy sessions by Queen Latifah, with comedy ranging from the slapstick, to the plain juvenile toilet tricks.Attempts to elevate the movie and give the characters more depth, come in the form of Jack Fuller learning to believe in himself and to shed his playboy, non-committal ways, and with Joy McNally having to learn to let her hair down, lighten up, and basically doing something she loves rather than to continue doing things that she dislikes, in true ""live your dream"" fashion. And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix, you'd have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale, where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.I thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves, i.e. one's dating an older woman, the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well, at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages, but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles, Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets, and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie, since she has on display, really menacing looking biceps, and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.Kutcher on the other hand is, well, Kutcher from Punk'd, with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead, the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater, Fuller's best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, and I'd stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies, as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.At best, What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic- comedy from the factories of Hollywood, or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer. Stay behind after the end credits roll for a final coda. There are 2 at the beginning of the end credits, but hold out right until the end before you decide to make for the exit.",What Happens in Vegas

13,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Typical, but still funny",5,11 May 2008,"When I first saw the trailer to What Happens in Vegas..., I thought it did look so predictable, but it had some really funny moments in the trailer, so I still wanted to see it. The only sad part, we have Cameron Diaz(who looks like a really good looking aging woman) and Ashton Kutcher(who still looks and acts like he's 12 years old), so we have two obnoxious actors that could have made a very disastrous film. But I saw What Happens in Vegas... yesterday and even though it was very predictable and stupid, it still had some very funny moments. I mean, Cameron and Ashton play two of the most unlikeable characters in movie history, who just bicker back and forth. The characters who win you over in the film are Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, who's fighting is actually very funny. But Aston and Cameron had some really good moments too.Joy just got dumped by her boyfriend in front of her friends, Jack just got fired by his own father, so what's next for them? VEGAS! They happen to meet when their rooms get mixed up and end up drinking together, having a ball in Vegas, and end up accidentally marrying each other. When they come too, they realize it was a mistake, but start bickering, Joy leaves a quarter at her slot machine and Jack puts it in and wins 3 million dollars! But when it comes to the annulment, for some strange and unbelievable reason, the judge sentences them to 6 months hard marriage and freezes the money. So these two who have nothing in common battle it out, until of course they fall for each other.What Happens in Vegas... is silly and predictable, but I do think the rating her on IMDb is a little harsh. I completely side with people who hate Cameron and Ashton, but their battle scenes together are pretty funny. Just I've seen so many worse films, this was just a fun romantic comedy to lighten the spirit of Iron Man and Speed Racer, not to mention the more action packed movies for the summer. So I'd say it's worth the look, but more of a rental vs. a high priced ticket, but just have fun, I think you'll get more than a few laughs.5/10",What Happens in Vegas
14,sddavis63,"Shallow, Silly, Predictable - But Still Not Bad",6,29 April 2011,"It's shallow, it's silly, it's completely predictable - and for all that, it ain't bad. Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher made for a likable enough pair as Joy and Jack. Joy gets dumped, Jack gets fired and both head off the Las Vegas where they meet by coincidence, get drunk together and end up married. Jack wins a $3 million slot machine jackpot and a fight over who should get the money post-annulment ensues, complicated by the fact that the judge insists that they go through six months of marriage counselling and try to make their marriage work.For the most part, this is an enjoyable enough movie. I even chuckled out loud a few times, which I don't always do with comedies. Admittedly I wasn't especially taken with Rob Corddry and Lake Bell as Jack and Joy's best friends. Their parts weren't especially necessary and frankly their characters grated on me a bit. But Joy and Jack were fun to watch, even when they were out to get each other. Of course you know where this is going from the very first moment the movie starts. But still, as a bit of escapist silliness this is fine. (6/10)",What Happens in Vegas
15,Buddy-51,yet another cheesy romantic comedy,4,22 April 2009,"The question before us is this: would you stay married to a person you'd just recently met (and whom you could barely stand) if you knew that, after six months as a couple, you would be free to go your separate ways and - here's the really good part - be handed a prize of $3,000,000 for your trouble? If that sounds like the setup for yet another of those preposterously cheesy TV reality shows, think again. It's actually the premise of ""What Happens in Vegas,"" a big-budget romantic comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Catherine Diaz as two Manhattanites who get more than they bargained for when they head to Sin City for an emotional pick-me-up after suffering major traumas in their lives. Jack has recently been fired from his carpentry job (by his own father no less), while Joy has suffered the humiliation of being dumped by her fiancé in front of all their mutual friends. When the two strangers meet, it's instant pandemonium, thanks to an adjoining hotel bathroom, an abundance of free-flowing liquor, some quickie nuptials and a slot-machine jackpot worth $1.5 million dollars per person.Just how this couple winds up getting hitched - and why so much money is involved in the outcome - need not be detailed here. All you need to know is that ""What Happens in Vegas"" plays out with all the clichés one would expect from a romantic comedy, as Jack and Joy hurl objects and invective at one another until, as if by magic, it suddenly dawns on them how truly, madly, deeply in love with each other they are and that maybe, with a little teamwork and effort, they could make this marriage thing work for real. To complete the totality of the cliché, both Jack and Joy are saddled with best friends (Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, respectively) who function as wacky, wisecracking sidekicks - and who help them pull off all the insufferably inane, mean-spirited tricks the principal characters play on each other. Jason Sudeikis, Queen Latifah, Dennis Miller and Treat Williams also put in appearances, though my suspicion is that they'd be more than happy to have this particular turkey expunged from their acting resumes toot sweet.The sad fact is that it's a mite difficult to develop a rooting interest in a relationship in which the two individuals display all the wit and emotional maturity of a couple of developmentally-disabled five-year-olds. The lower these two otherwise attractive people stoop in their treatment of one another, the more disheartening - and less funny - the movie itself becomes.",What Happens in Vegas

You would have to be Helen Keller and never find out what happened to ""Jack & Jill"" to not see from frame one what will ""happen"" in 'What Happens in Vegas.' It's easy to call this horrid, retched movie predictable, so I will quickly move on. All jokes fall flat, all acting is amateur and all chemistry is as unbelievable as Mike and Carol Brady's true love. And the premise? Well all movies have flaws, this one is built on one major mistake: lost souls Diaz and (the laugh-out-loud horrible) Kutcher visit Vegas at the same time their lives are crumbling and after a very unoriginal/stock-footage wild-night-in-Vegas, they marry, fight and win a progressive slot on *ONE* quarter. Uh, you can't even enter a bonus-round on a single coin, much less win a progressive prize. Let's see, they don't want to be married, so an extremely un-funny Dennis Miller sentences them to 6-months counseling with an equally uninteresting (Oscar nominee, really?) Queen Latifah as their marriage counselor to judge whether or not they win the Vegas prize money. I hated, hated, and hated this movie. No one involved seemed interested in making an original movie, plot or idea. They simply relied on large smiles, horribly executed revenge schemes and falling down for effect. The only thing that would have surprised me, and make me like the movie a tiny bit, was if the this so-called love/hate couple kill each other in the ending with spoons. I certainly tried that on myself while watching it. I love watching Vegas-themed movies. This was one of the exceptions. Aside from the countless stock-footage, the only thing they got right was the view from the Planet Hollywood Casino, which was the major blunder from the movie '21.' SKIP!",What Happens in Vegas
17,Robert_duder,Follows the romantic comedy genre recipe but delivers a lot of laughs and a lot of personality,8,10 June 2008,"Ultimately What Happens in Vegas is plainly an Ashton Kutcher, Cameron Diaz vehicle which could spell disaster but it doesn't. The two of them have great on screen personalities, with really good comedic timing and lots of talent in the physical comedy aspect and the great thing is that they happen to have really good chemistry together as well so it makes this movie work. However it makes it work so well that What Happens In Vegas is an above average romantic comedy and despite predictability and following the tried and true romantic genre recipe the film delivers the two of them and you love every minute of it...and I'm not even a Diaz fan. It's true what many IMDb reviewers have said...if you watch the trailer you get the gist of the entire film and you can pretty much count off what's going to happen but the great thing is you don't care because the two of them are having a blast and you know it. I noticed the poster outside the theater has listed in bigger font than the name of the film ASHTON and CAMERON...no last names just their really big first names because that is what this film is all about and somehow and for some reason it works really well.Ashton Kutcher plays slacker, child at heart and non-monogamous 20 something male Jack Fuller. Kutcher looks exactly like he did on That 70's show which endears his already fans to him and his typical happy go lucky, carefree funny attitude makes him a star and it really works for this film because you root for him and the character has a serious side but not enough to take away from Kutcher's top notch comedy bit including physical comedy which I think takes a lot of talent. Cameron Diaz returns to comedy and does really well as uptight workaholic Joy McNally, which somehow makes their character perfect for each other but the strange thing is it does actually make them perfect for each other. They have great chemistry and although it's not exactly a passionate chemistry they just seem to be fun together and it works so well for this movie. While I'm admittedly not a huge Cameron Diaz fan she does have her talented side and she shows a lot of really good comedic talent as well and she's always had a knack for physical comedy (Charlie's Angel's, There's Something About Mary.) The token best friend roles are played by Rob Corddry and Lake Bell and they do their respective roles very well. They don't take away from or even come close to Diaz and Kutcher but they are good and fit well into the cast.While I wasn't exactly rolling in the aisles there is some really genuinely funny moments and unlike most comedies the horde of trailers out there didn't wreck too many of the truly funny moments. Surprisingly this comedy could have been a lot less intelligent with a lot of what I always call toilet humor and while there was some I didn't feel like I lost brain cells watching it so you can actually go in and enjoy the comedy and I think it's one of the better 'cute comedies' I've seen in quite some time. It's a terrific date movie that guys and girls can enjoy equally. Definitely worth the price of admission and a comedy I would see again. 8 out of 10",What Happens in Vegas
18,Lejink,Leaving Las Vegas,4,26 August 2008,"Not our usual type of film but stuck for a movie on Saturday night, someone had left this lying about the house and attracted by the word Vegas in the title and seeking something undemanding, my wife and I settled down to watch this atypical 2000-era rom-com. By which I mean, take the usual ingredients of a young attractive cast, fantastical plot centring this time around a $3 million payday if said attractive young couple, Kurtcher and Diaz, can get over their initial antipathy to each other and make something of their drunken marriage in Vegas, throw in spats with friends, former lovers and parents and finish up with lashings of sentimentality and guess whether you get a happy ending or not... If this all sounds like a plot from ""Friends"" you would be dead right, all that's lacking though are the smart one-liners the TV show delivers plus more engaging acting than you get here. Diaz and Kurtcher try hard and certainly throw themselves into their parts but occasionally you can see them acting under the weight of the forced humour they're purveying. Nothing really makes you laugh out loud although I smiled occasionally, especially when Diaz fell off the bar in her drunken revelry. That apart it was good to see Treat Williams getting some work and amidst a welter of inconsequential songs in the frenzied mile-a-minute soundtrack, detect a track from the late, great Ian Dury. Besides which, I'm struggling to find something really memorable to say about the movie Worse still, Vegas itself only appears for about 15 minutes...",What Happens in Vegas
19,MLDinTN,has a predictable ending but...,7,22 March 2009,"it has some laughs getting to the end. I thought some of the things that Jack and Joy did to each other while married were very funny. But to start at the beginning, Joy, Cameron Diaz, is humiliated in front of her friends by her fiancé when he breaks up with her. Jack, Ashton Kutcher, has just been fired by his dad and is not known as marriage material. They are both from New York and decide to go to Vegas with a friend. There is a mix up at the hotel and that is how they meet. And from there they have a fun drunken night and wake up married. But before leaving Vegas, Jack hits a jackpot with Joy's quarter, so the squabbling over the money ensues.A judge sentences them to stay married for 6 months and try to make it work in order for them to split the money. Of course, by now that can't stand each other, so many funny hi-junks ensue in which they try to get the other one to give up or cheat, so they can get all the money. They play some pretty mean pranks on each other. But, when Joy invited Jack to her office retreat to make an impression, they realize maybe the don't hate each other after all. Then you probably can already guess how it ends.FINAL VERDICT: Better than I expected. I recommend it if you are looking for a funny date movie.",What Happens in Vegas
20,cricketbat,Standard romantic comedy,6,17 August 2018,"A standard romantic comedy (complete with obligatory ending chase scene), but the reason it gets the extra half a star is because of some hilarious moments and one-liners with Ashton Kutcher.

21,lesleyharris30,"Character's are Unlikeable and Just Not Funny,",4,30 November 2013,"What Happens In Vegas is a below average movie with a very cliché romantic comedy storyline that is made even worse with a cast that don't deliver any heart to their unlikeable characters,made even worse with one bad joke after another,the majority of them being offensive to both genders.I love Cameron Diaz and it is very rare when she lets me down,but this is a very big exception,Ashton Kutcher is alright but his movies are very hit or miss and this is definitely a big miss.While the story may seem like a fun and original set up for a romantic comedy, it really is the exact opposite,I would recommend What Happens in Vegas to absolutely no one.When Joy (Cameron Diaz) and Jack (Ashton Kutcher) meet in Las Vegas for one crazy night,they wake up the next morning married.They both agree to divorce until Jack wins $3 million in a casino with Joy's coin,then the couple are forced to stay married for 6 months to receive $1.5 million each.",What Happens in Vegas
22,inkblot11,"What happens when you get two supernova stars, Diaz & Kutcher, together? You get a sizzler, despite a so-so script!",7,13 May 2008,"Joy (Cameron Diaz) is a Wall Street financier with a rich fiancé. However, her intended is an overbearing killjoy and she has struggled for four years to please him. Naturally, on the day she throws him a surprise birthday party, he breaks off the engagement in earshot of the hiding guests. Crushed, Joy receives advice from close friend, Tipper (Lake Bell) that they should head for Vegas, where troubles get washed away like rain. Jack (Ashton Kutcher), a talented cabinet-maker, works for his father (Treat Williams) but has a touch of the Peter Pan syndrome and goofs off on the job repeatedly, causing his dad to finally fire him. He, too, heads to Vegas with a lawyer pal, Hater (Rob Cordrry). Of course, the mixed-up duo, Joy and Jack, meet, get drunk together, and end up marrying late into the night. When morning comes, both are chagrined at the situation but, playing the slots for diversion, Jack hits a 3 million dollar jackpot, with Joy's quarter. Since they are married, things get complicated, especially when a tough-nut judge (Dennis Miller) will not grant them a quickie divorce and money-split but insists that they try marriage for six months. Horrors indeed! Joy moves into Jack's place, which Lysol has not touched in ages and where each is out to sabotage the other. Will they kill each other in the process? This is a movie built on star power, rather than a great script. Diaz and Kutcher are, well, supernova actors, with good reason. Each of them is gorgeous and very deft at comedy. It is no small pleasure at all to see them in action, it is a mighty one. The rest of the cast is likewise good, with Corddry doing a great turn as a woman-hating scummy lawyer and Miller, in a small role, making the most of his good lines. Queen Latifah is on hand, too, as the court appointed marriage counselor to the young couple and she is also a joy. The costumes are knockout, especially Joy's gold-colored dress to a work-related retreat and dance. Also nice is the scenery, both in New York and in Vegas. So, why is this movie getting mixed reviews? It falls to the script, for the direction is rather good. There are some very funny scenes, such as the one in which an older ""girl scout"" shows up at Jack's doorstep for some unusual merit badge training. But, alas, the screenplay goes hot and cold, with some jokes just falling flat. Perhaps, a second screenwriter (like Buck Henry, haha) would have turned this one into a big winner. Yet, in the final analysis, the film is most enjoyable, thanks to the sizzling Diaz and Kutcher, and the very uplifting ending. If you are a romcom fan, do not miss it for the world. But, even if you prefer other genres, my guess is that you will end up laughing and smiling, for that is what happens when lovable stars surpass the material.",What Happens in Vegas
23,Thanos_Alfie,Not boring but predictable...,4,1 November 2018,"""What Happens in Vegas"" is a Romance - Comedy movie in which we watch a man and a woman compelled, for some legal reasons, to live life pretending to be a couple for a limited period of time. They have to do that in order to achieve their goal which is money. Everything changes when they are starting pretending that they are a couple and have to live together in the same place. Something that is very difficult since both of them were singles before that.This movie is not something extraordinary, it won't blow your mind with its plot or the interpretations of its cast. It's just funny and enjoyable, nothing more than that. Since I had low expectations from this movie I was not let down by it and I was not happily or sadly surprised. The interpretation of Cameron Diaz who played as Joy McNally was below average and I did not like it. In addition to this, I have to say that the interpretation of Ashton Kutcher who played as Jack Fuller was not enough but I have to admit that he did his best. The direction was good for a Romance - Comedy movie made by Tom Vaughan.Lastly, I believe that ""What Happens in Vegas"" is an average movie with poor plot, medium interpretation by its cast but I am sure that you will have fun watching it. Do not expect much and you won't be disappointed by it. It's not a boring movie, it has some good scenes but as I said before don't expect much from it.",What Happens in Vegas
24,Floated2,If going to Vegas...don't even bother,2,21 September 2010,"Just like many recent romantic comedy films the storyline and plot aren't very difficult and all fall into the same kind of format. What happens in Vegas is pretty much no different.The premise is slick enough: A goof-off (Ashton Kutcher) and a career-minded woman (Cameron Diaz) meet cute and marry drunk in Vegas and immediately regret it. But just as they're about to part ways, he wins $3 million on the slots, with 'her' quarter. A cranky judge orders them to stay married, cohabitate and go into marriage counselling for six months before they can split the winnings.But while the actors are game, the movie just isn't terribly inventive or funny. It's content to grind through the plot points and stock characters of a certain repetitive breed of rom-com -- filling the screen with flat lighting and wacky best friends and montages set to tinkly music and interrupting the bickering with chases and cute-girl slapstick. After the initial charm wears off, the whole thing gets check-your-text-messages dull. In short, this film is just plain not funny, it has a horrible script which is completely not believable and there are just way too many stupid scenes, along with pretty bad acting from the cast. I really wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. It was that bad",What Happens in Vegas
25,pennyelenabooks,nice but...,4,17 February 2014,"The main idea behind the movie is simple : two people find themselves in Las Vegas, during a difficult period of their lives- Jack has lost his job and Joy has broken up with her fiancé.

At court a few days later the judge decides that in order to take the money they must remain married for six months. The problem is that they can't stand each other. The plot is interesting and funny, with not many twists however. The couple doesn't convince that they belong with each other and the love that develops between them happens all of a sudden and in the end mainly. The supporting roles are funny and interesting though. All in all, an entertaining movie, with lots of laugher but the romance seem to ruin the whole thing.

26,insomniac_rod,Just watch it for a few laughs.,6,10 December 2010,"To be completely honest, I only expected this movie to be popcorn fun. I started very weak and extremely cheesy. The way Cameron Díaz shows Ashton Kutcher the ring after he wins in Vegas is one of the cheesiest scenes I've seen in Hollywood's crap.Then the movie gets really dull, pointless, and not funny. Fortunately, it gets better on the second half and that's because it takes an unconventional way in difference with similar movies.Towards the ending it gets actually funny and almost creative.The performances are just fine. Cameron Díaz is always sexy and bubbly. Her legs are a delight to watch. Ashton Kutcher is good in this role. Just as goofy as ever. Lake Bell is the highlight in my opinion. She's extremely hot, candy for the eye, and her performance is actually funny. I liked when she was called stripper and when Jason S.'s character draws an obscene picture to her during the court meeting. The guest cameos are funny. Zack G. is hilarious.Watch this movie only if it airs on cable. It's not worth your money but it's up for a few good laughs.",What Happens in Vegas
27,Chris Knipp,You have to care and not care,7,30 May 2008,"A lazy young man who's just been fired by his own father and an uptight financial sector striver just dumped by her boyfriend go to Las Vegas with pals to forget and, meeting, get married in a night of drunken carousing and diminished rationality. Then he wins $3 million on a slot machine with her quarter and they wind up in court fighting over an annulment and the right to the three million. The judge dislikes them both equally and sentences them to remain married and cohabit for six months and prove they're working to get along. A series of domestic plots and battles follows as each tries to outsmart the other to win in court and get all the money. They end up liking each other. I know the reviewers are right to trash this movie, but they're missing something essential that would raise the audience rating a good many points above the critics' if they fail to note one thing that is the main reason why most of us go to see it. 'What Happens in Vegas' has not only the trappings of a big, expensive Hollywood comedy, the bright colors and nice sets, but two big glamorous stars, and they are not humiliated by being here, because they do look very good, and mismatch or not, look good together too. Yes, the script is lousy. The setups and jokes are lame and clichéd and sometimes crass, tasteless, and adolescent. The arc is predictable. The progression isn't particularly interesting or even logical. The individual scenes consequently aren't ever pitched to be very funny and the dialog never surprises you either. But that very lack of high pitched comedy can be a plus if you find Cameron amazing and cool and Ashton gorgeous and appealing. The absence of a high laugh level such as the Apatow comedies occasionally achieve means they get to act more like people; they can register ordinary expressions instead of mere comic mugging and you get to look at them, which is one good and durable reason for watching this movie. And both are aging well. Ashton is big and handsome. The pretty-boy quality is fading into something more like an old time Hollywood leading man look. Cameron is sexy and elegant and looks great in a tight gown. Ashton has learned something since the staccato limitations of ""That Seventies Show."" He actually registers six or seven different, and recognizably human, expressions now. He's added sarcasm and meanness. He may be a people-pleaser forever, but he doesn't try as hard as he used to, nor does the good old boy personality hide a certain level of intelligence, just as the ""Punk'd"" bad-ass persona has never hidden an essential kindness. The one plot element that works is that he's the one of the pair who's got the emotional smarts; it is harder to believe Cameron's character is as cut off from feeling as she's supposed to be. But not too hard, because there's a hardness about her.Yes, it is disappointing that most of the Vegas night is done in a rapid-fire montage that's more like an acid trip than an evening of heavy drinking; that nothing sexier happens; that the wedding is reduced to a final (not very successful) outtake sequence. The ending is slushy sentimental; but it is sweet. The critics' revulsion remains incomprehensible to me because 'What Happens in Vegas' leaves a good taste, if not a very strong one. I was a little bothered by the young Asian woman (a misused Michelle Krusiec) being made so stereotypically the unappealing suffering striver: that's more mean than funny. Queen Latifah is mellow as always but wasted as the marriage counselor. Director Tom Vaughan deserves little credit, but it is writer Dana Fox who is most to blame for the mediocrity of the result. Kutcher and Diaz and the others do a very good job. When you think about it, how much is the ""originality"" of other recent Hollywood comedies really worth? Where's the trail-blazing in '40 Year Old Virgin,' 'Super Bad,' or even the wishful-thinking 'Juno'? But no mistake about it, this movie is for fans of good-looking people in glossy movies, not smart comedy or edge. Compare this to Ashton in 'Just Married' and you'll see this role is better. For sheer mindless fun he peaked in 'Dude, Where's My Car?' Of course Cameron has a far stronger comedy--and general movie--résumé, so again Ashton's playing opposite her is not a step back but a step forward. But an attempt to analyze the plot seems futile. Its failings are too obvious to bother listing.",What Happens in Vegas

30,davispittman,Diaz is the ONLY good thing here,4,21 March 2017,"This Cameron Diaz/Ashton Kutcher romantic comedy really just isn't too good. It's not all that entertaining or funny, which really is the most important thing with movies like this, if a film like this isn't amusing or funny then there is nothing else to make it good. The lackluster writing and jokes that fall flat is very unfortunate because I think that the premise to the movie is interesting and has some actual potential to create a funny movie people can have a good time with, but instead of trying to make it humorous and enjoyable, they phoned it in. Cameron Diaz's acting is actually decent, she isn't bad, it's just that she isn't really given much to do. Ashton Kutcher has never been one of my favorites, and that didn't change after seeing this film. I don't know why some people have said in the past that he's charming in films, I don't find anything really charming or attractive about him, especially not in this movie. He plays a very crude disgusting guy here. Standing on the kitchen counter-top, unzipping his pants and pissing in the sink..... Oh and then opening his sweat pants and dumping a bowl of popcorn in his crotch. If that is what this movie thinks is funny then you know you're in trouble. The only saving grace this movie had was Cameron Diaz, she is cute and sweet in a lot of scenes and that is good to see, but the humor is so non-existent and Kutcher's character is so unlikable. 4/10.",What Happens in Vegas

But instead of giving them an annulment the judge orders them to stay married for six months, in order to get a part of the money. Now a bitter feud start where they try to sabotage for each other in order to get all the money for themselves.Comments: A Hollywood blockbuster that actually works pretty well. It is funny, quirky and even if the main concept are unoriginal it has its own little fresh twists and turns. It got some really good jokes, and manages to hold a high level throughout the entire movie. It isn't just some small and few jokes that are funny, it is actually constantly funny. The best part however, is actually just after the story really ended, when they show what really happened in Vegas. Stay put and don't miss it, it got some good scenes after the credits too.Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz might seem like an odd match, but they work really well together. They really work as a pair, but don't forget that they both are solid comedians, veterans in these types of movies. And they certainly don't disappoint. But the supporting cast should get their credit too. The movies wouldn't be the same, not nearly as good without their partners in crime, played by Lake Bell and Rob Corddry.I guess that this is something that almost everyone can enjoy, a perfect movie when there are different tastes. I suspect that most people out there will find this funny, because it is very well made, even though it is not an epic classic.7/10",What Happens in Vegas

38,TheUnknown837-1,"when it tries to be romantic, it's kind of sweet, but when it tries to be funny, it's abominable",5,8 June 2010,"Around the halfway point of ""What Happens in Vegas,"" I had my arms tucked against my chest, exclaiming: ""Thank you! Thank you!"" because at last, this lame-brained romantic comedy was taking a turn for the better. At last the filmmakers were done with trying to be funny, at which they failed, and started attempting to make their film sweet, which toward the end, it sort of was. However, as sweet as the romantic second half of ""What Happens in Vegas"" was, I must confess it was not quite enough to save the picture entirely.The movie's plot is a typical formula for a modern-day romantic comedy. Ashton Kutcher is a low-life who gets fired from his job by his employer/father (Treat Williams) and Cameron Diaz is the recently-dumped girlfriend of a snobby businessman. By coincidence, they both live in New York and by coincidence, they both decide to take their best friends with them on a relieving trip to Vegas. There, they meet up, party, get drunk, and when they recover from their hang-overs the next morning, Kutcher and Diaz find out their got married on a whim the night before. Things turn for the bizarre(r) when they accidentally win three million dollars on a slot machine. A judge declares they must live together for six months before a divorce can be made and the money can be split and then.... Golly, how I wish they'd start making ones like ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940) again.I predicted from the get-go that ""What Happens in Vegas"" was going to be in a word, awful, and for the first hour, it was just that. During that long run of would-be gags, I don't think I laughed once. Those tasteless jokes did nothing but make me roll my eyes and sigh with discomfort. Unimaginative gags such as a character named Dick Banger, I'm afraid, just don't make me laugh. Nor does Ashton Kutcher urinating into the sink.Now, I have to admit that the second half of the movie did start to win me over. Because, like with many other movies like this, other modern-day romantic comedies, in the second act they throw away the jokes and try to be sweet and heart-warming and here, they started to work. However, it just was not quite enough to save the film because that first hour was just so incredible exhausting. I think both Kutcher and Diaz are promising performers, though I haven't seen a film with either of them that I wholeheartedly liked, and I liked the supporting performances with Treat Williams and Dennis Farina, but ultimately this entry is just another example of kitschy bathroom humor.Yes, the last half of the movie was sort of pleasant, but I would not want to sit through those abysmal jokes that populate the first hour again.",What Happens in Vegas
39,jaredmobarak,Oh Lovebiscuit; Yes Tickle-Monkey?What Happens in Vegas,3,8 May 2008,"I went into the screening of What Happens in Vegas thinking I was in store for a train-wreck; I mean the trailer looked horrible. I suffer the pain for all of you readers, though, in the hopes that you won't have to live the same fate. In actuality, the movie ended up being a same-old, same-old rom-com that had some laughs, but overall just plodded along to its inevitable conclusion. Being that this pair of New Yorkers, married after a night of heavy drinking in Vegas, must spend six months as man and wife before a judge decides what to do with the three million dollar jackpot they won, one would think we'd get a lot of their trials and tribulations, probably way too sentimental for anyone to stand. Instead, we get gag after gag as the two attempt to sabotage the union to take the money for themselves. Only about half the film takes place during the six months, however, it feels like six years. I couldn't believe the running time was only an hour and a half, it felt a lot longer. All this said; if someone has their mind set on seeing a film of this kind, my words would not detract yousomething the producers know. I'll say one thing, whomever came up with the marketing plan of selling Las Vegas with the tag used in the title here is going to bed with a smile this weekend, snuggling up with the piles of money overflowing his roomhe couldn't ask for a better affirmation of that simple phrase.The premise itself is just a rehash of the same dried up plot used in Hollywood whenever the bank seems a tad low. Man and woman get together, are forced to stay together against their will, and eventually find out all the good things they didn't notice about each other beforehand. We have the stereotypical friends trying to help their buddy come out of the situation unscathed and a winner; the token parents and ex-fiancé who set into motion the events that get the odd couple to meet; and the supporting roles that help infuse some much needed comedy into an otherwise stale story. I do jest somewhat; the movie isn't without some good moments. The scenes that are overplayed in the TV spots fall flat of course, but there are other moments saved for the big show that deliver. I will admit to loving the work retreat for our leading lady, mostly due to Dennis Farina's scene-stealing cameo as her boss. He is absolutely hilarious, whether it is his mannerisms, his facial expressions towards Chong and her husband, or his complete exuberance tempered with a strict work ethic.I should probably mention the leads before I go too far. Admittedly, I don't care very much for either Cameron Diaz or Ashton Kutcher. If I hadn't the knowledge of Kutcher being married to Demi Moore, I'd have been totally taken out of the film just by the age difference between these two lovers. No offense to Diaz, but she isn't getting any younger. Their real age difference is only six years, yet it appears to be much more here. Diaz isn't horrible, she is herself; if that is your thing you won't be disappointed. Kutcher, however, actually surprised me a bit. He is quite likable here, even when partaking in blatant subterfuge and hijinks. Far from being a great actor, he plays the role perfectly, even hamming it up to uncomfortable levels when ""acting"" in his role. Trying to show emotions that his character is faking leads to very funny moments and such horrible acting one must credit him for seeming natural when being himself. The two have some chemistry and you can see the abrasive union mixed with understanding and an ability to be truthful to each other. When they begin to fall for one another towards the end, (seriously, this shouldn't be ruining anything for you), I really started to enjoy their relationship. It was a good payoff from the over-the-top antics of hatred at the start.As for the supporting cast, there are some gems and some wasted talent. Once again, much like Stranger Than Fiction, I don't know what Queen Latifah is doing. I really enjoy her and find it incomprehensible that she needs to take throwaway roles like this to stay afloatsomeone please offer her a real part. Lake Bell is funny and endearingly sassy and sarcastic as Diaz's best friend Tipper while Rod Corddry vaults himself out of my not-a-fan-of ranks to be funny at all times. It appears that he can be likable when playing an ass, rather than a man of power that doesn't realize he is an ass (Harold & Kumar 2). Treat Williams brings some nice touch to his father role, some added laughs as well as heart, and even Zach Galifianakis has his moments playing pretty much the same role he does in everything he touches.I really wanted to just bash on this film, but while feeling long and without any originality, I didn't absolutely hate it. The acting was fine and not without its moments while some of the setups delivered on their attempts for comedy. You will start to get tired of the games they play with each other as the ante is upped over and over again, more for the benefit of the audience then any real plot necessity. Once the two calm down and start to really see each other is when I must say I got a bit caught up in everything. Still, though, I can't recommend anyone go out and spend your hard-earned Friday night cash for this one. All I can say is that sitting through the first 90 minutes does payoff with the greatest two scenes of the entire movie at the start of the credits. If you're already paid for and in your seat, don't leave earl; those final moments are priceless.",What Happens in Vegas

She really has a great sense of humor and an absolutely fabulous heiny! Seeing Cameron in her skivies is worth way more than 3,000,000 bucks. It has a great cast. Dennis Farina is great. Lake Bell is good in her role and a real spark plug. Rob Cordry is funny as the side mate and he should do more stuff that's funny on TV and in movies and stuff. Vegas! Vegas, baby! Queen Latifah is good to see and funny to watch. Deirdre O'Connell is wonderful as Ashton's character's mom. Who is that? Do I know her? Treat Williams is classic as Ashton's character's dad. Jason Seudekis is funny and he stands out as a good soon to be star. Dennis Miller is hilarious as the judge. Dennis Miller should be in charge of purgatory. Is that where we are now? No. Zach Galfinakas is gosh darn funny and he's involved in one of the best parts of this funny comedy. Andy Daly is hilarious and plays a funny part. Krysten Ritter is very memorable and she is looking smoking hot. Michelle Krusiec is really impressive and super appealing. I really find her to be nice and Michelle should make a name for herself more in the future. Cameron and Ashton's characters are really good.

41,mario_c,"For an average Hollywood comedy, it's not bad",6,8 May 2008,"This romantic comedy starts with a good premise: two strangers meet in Las Vegas and after an evening of wildness and many drinks they get married and win a prize of 3,000,000 dollars on a slot machine. They agree to divorce and split the money, but the Judge doesn't concede it to them, and force them to live together for 6 months, in order to make them try to succeed their marriage. It's the beginning of a living hell to them, because they can't stand each other In the beginning the movie has a bit of originality and fits perfectly in the ""it's so stupid that it turns out funny"" comedy type but then, step by step, it turns into an average and ""normal"" romantic comedy. It has great number of comic scenes and some of them are really funny, but if we exclude the beginning the plot really lacks originality and significance. We can see it especially at the ending, because it has the expected, conventional, and boring Hollywood ending we are all used to watch in this sort of comedies.I liked the performances of the main actors though. I think Ashton Kutcher is funny, in his own and particular way, like he was before on previous comedies; and Cameron Diaz still has that smile that I used to appreciate so much in my teenage years Of course it's not an excellent comedy, it's even a bit ridiculous and flawed at parts, but it's funny and entertaining, and for a ""typical average Hollywood comedy"" it's not bad",What Happens in Vegas
42,doctorsmoothlove,Forgettable but with something to say,4,31 December 2008,"What Happens in Vegas is a forgettable motion picture that has few redeeming qualities. Through one line of dialog and its plot structure, the film makes a poignant observation about American marriage patterns. For that, I'm going to award it two stars of five. Does that mean you should view it? My recommendation is that you don't, unless you are writing a paper on marriage patterns.Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is a clueless construction worker who is aware of how stupid he really is. He revels in his ""not being marriage material."" The film spoils us by having him fired. Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) is a stockbroker who is dumped by her fiancé on his birthday. Both of them live in New York. Its plot is similar to Legally Blonde, recycled again here. Both movies feature a young woman dumped by her fiancé and his realization of his poor decision. Anyway, the two meet in Vegas and marry in a drunken haze. Jack also wins 3 million dollars from a slot machine. The two bimbos decide to divorce and split the money. The divorce court refuses their request and requires them to ""hard marriage"" for six months. They must visit a marriage counselor and prove they are attempting to save the marriage. So that's what happens. By the end of the slapstick, Joy and Jack are in love but still divorce. They finally elect to get married again once the picture ends.The beginning of the movie offers direct wisdom and contribution to homosexual marriage supporters. The judge says ""gays aren't ruining marriage, people like you are."" I agree with him. The Vegas-style divorce mocks the effort many people make to build effective marriages. It parodies something as beautiful as marriage in a distasteful way. Through Jack and Joy's numerous attempts to make each other cheat, thereby awarding the committed one with all the money, What Happens in Vegas demonstrates this. I also felt the ending, contrived it may be, as effective in bring closure to the film's critique. Jack and Joy prove that some people actually can make amends even if a few million dollars is on the line. You don't have to divorce immediately, you know. The movie is too long and is filled with potty humor between effective bits but it works. This would have been a great idea for an episode in a Lifetime sitcom but not as a theatrical motion picture.The movie is directed by novice Tom Vaughn who has only one other film to his credit. He does a good job with the material. This kind of movie doesn't require much direction, but he does include many overhead shots of New York which look nice. At least they provide diversion from the tedium of the film's unnecessary slapstick. Kutcher and Diaz are disposable actors here, but they are in on the joke. I wish Fox had allowed this picture to be a dramatic piece. It has a good premise but shouldn't have been a romantic comedy. A dramatic comedy version of What Happens in Vegas would enhance its criticism.There are many romantic comedies out there. There are a lot of better films than this one, but not many worse ones. I can't recommend a movie like this with only a line of dialog (and a probably unintended message) for those outside its target audience.** out of *****",What Happens in Vegas

She then decides that as they are married she is entitled to half... but a judge disagrees and makes them live as husband and wife to earn the cash.It is a cheesy comedy that has some good moments and some bad moments.The story is quite good, but this is a romantic comedy so just like all romcoms, the first 2 thirds of the movie is very good, but the final part is just mushy dribble.The movie stars Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz. They are both completely over the top in this movie. I am not overly impressed with either of them as actors. I think Cameron can be funny, but generally just annoying. Ashton is not very funny, but can be entertaining at times. He was quite funny in this though.There were a lot of predictable moments in this film. There wasn't anything really original in there. I did like the way they fought each other throughout... I think that is was made this film as entertaining as it was.There are a lot of romantic comedies out there and sometimes I wish there would be some more original stories, but it seems that if you are making a film like this, there is a typical formula that you have to stick to.This film is good, it is funny, it is entertaining, but it is not the best.

The story, though far-fetched (often laughably so), is new. . . even if the 'detest regardless of love for a goal' idea has been done many times (notably with 'How to Lose a Guy' and the like). Cameron and Ashton put forth apt performances that suited their roles well. The sophomore effort by writer Dana Fox ('The Wedding Date') eclipses that of her first script (which I found quite a bit below average). And Vaughan's direction worked well. He chose great Las Vegas and NY settings to shoot the film and made me crave Vegas so much that I booked a trip for a couple weeks for now. Perhaps they could give him a few bucks for helping tourism? Overall, it's not a disappointment if you don't expect too much.Final verdict: 6.5/10.",What Happens in Vegas

Fortunately, it's done well enough that it can stand the passage of time. It was an instant hit, and I must say, it's easy to watch over and over again.Cameron Diaz who plays a modern power woman and Ashton Kutcher who plays a lazy party guy are funny as hell, and perfect for each other. Their sidekicks carry the brunt of the crazy behaviors and make the main characters look more normal.The scenario is a nice roller coaster with few pause that only serve as jumping board for more wacky entertainment. The romance itself and the sweetening of the story is even well done. The souring was also handled pretty well, they didn't go off the deep end, and did it simply. The soundtrack is upbeat and current, and the editing hide some nice surprises.The only thing I could reproach is the plainness of the dialogs. Nothing spectacular there, but no clumsy attempts either and it's funny, so it's difficult to really complain.Weirdly enough, no sex, which is good, it would have just ruined the vibe.

It's a rarity: two ridiculously hot but likable people with such excellent comic timing.Recently dumped Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) is a planaholic who meets and marries unemployed Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) in a random Vegas vacay. They agree to divorce, but they win US$3M before that could happen. For them to be able to keep the money, however, a conservative judge (Dennis Miller) forces the two to make their marriage work for six months. The expected bickering and one-upmanship ensues but the audience eagerly coasts along because when Diaz and Kutcher are funny, they're REALLY funny, and when it's time for the romance portion of the deal, the ex-models transition very easily because they're not only gorgeous; they also have chemistry.But Diaz and Kutcher are only able to make What Happens in Vegas work because of the darn good writing from Dana Fox (The Wedding Date). They also get very able support from co-stars Lake Bell (Over Her Dead Body) and Rob Corddry (also in Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay), who play their best friends Tipper and Hater, and SNL writer Jason Sudeikis (also 'Floyd' in 30 Rock), who plays Joy's hateful ex-fiancé Mason with marvelous subtlety.Romantic comedies must be a pain to write because its formula is already so familiar to the audience, but What Happens in Vegas, for all its banality, is one of the funniest rom-coms to have come our way in recent years.",What Happens in Vegas

56,moutonbear25,What Happens in Hollywood,7,10 May 2008,"What happens in Hollywood does not often happen in the real world. Where else but in a Hollywood created world would any judge find legal justification to sentence two people who got married on a drunken whim in Vegas to six months hard marriage in hopes they might learn their lesson? Nowhere, that's where. However, if you can't get past the ludicrous nature of the premise, than you're in for an even harder conviction. Luckily, the newlyweds, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher, are so darn likable that it's pretty easy to look the other way (even easier when they make the view so pleasing on the eyes). All that WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS needs is Queen Latifah in some oddly suited, voice of reason role to give it some real kick. Oh wait, there she is.The main reason Jack and Joy's marriage doesn't just disappear quietly is because there is the small matter of the $3 million they won in a slot jackpot just as they had decided that perhaps their lifetime commitment was a tad hasty. If they stay together and show that they really tried to make it work for six months, they split the money evenly. On the other hand, if one can prove that the other didn't try, quit or cheated, the partner that stuck it out keeps the whole bag. Jack and Joy proceed to some very dirty pool and Diaz and Kutcher are having too much messing with each other for us not to join in. Their performances are fully surface based (he supposedly gave up trying to be somebody out of fear he would become nobody while she apparently works too hard at something she can't stand doing but you wouldn't know if they didn't specifically tell you) but they are each spot on with their comedic timing and physical presence that you'll find yourself laughing a lot more than you might have expected to.Another all too typical Hollywood convention anchors WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS. It wouldn't be Hollywood if Jack and Joy didn't both realize that the person they married might actually be their perfect match. If only there weren't all that money keeping them from giving in to their true feelings. Fortunately, in Hollywood, when it comes to love and money, you can have plenty of both.",What Happens in Vegas

Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher light up the screen in a believable romance that moves from New York to Vegas and back with high energy, fun, silliness, and a pleasure to see such attractive young actors nail a comedy in a well written story with lush locations/sets. An audience would be ready to see Diaz and Kutcher together again in a film and maybe it will take them back to the magic of WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS. A solid supporting cast added to the film and to the humor of the story.The film also captures the real pressures of job performance vs. having a personal life in today's manic pace of work, work, work, and watching the difference in the characters of Diaz and Kutcher act out their stories brought out real meaning of wanting something that is more than a job.

First, we have Diaz looking very weird with some paint-on (?) tan and her hair is limp and thin and styled in a not very flattering way. Her career also seems to be doing a Diane Keaton. What happened to the cute ingénue with so much potential? She just looked awful and her acting was horrendous in this movie. Maybe she WAS drunk for the entire movie. Kutcher, though cute, I have never gotten, though I liked him okay enough in The Butterly Effect. I cannot seem to get out of my head that his only claim to fame is that he is married to Demi Moore (whose claim to fame is that she looks almost 20 years younger than she actually is). Diaz's character is one of those who have to plan to make plans, which sends her fiancé over the edge, and therefore she gets dumped by him as she is trying to give him a surprise birthday party. Kutcher is a slacker who has just been fired by his boss, who also happens to be his father. Somehow they, with their respective best buddies, end up in Las Vegas and sharing the same room. That gets resolved (not quite sure how that happened as it was fast and made no sense) by Diaz's character and Kutcher's character gets them a lot of free stuff to do while in Las Vegas. So the 4 head out on the town to celebrate. This is when I had had it with this movie. It was giving me a headache. Literally. What I saw was trite, not funny at all, and watching every actor in this movie struggle was tiring.

Lo and behold Joy and Jack get so drunk while they are raging that they meet and spend the night together. Its totally unrealistic and boring a as they discover they got married whilst being so inebriated. The next morning they both meet for breakfast and express their regret but it turns into the silliest of fights and Joy storms off and as she does Jack places a quarter in a slot machine and hits the Jackpot of $3 Million. Now in reality Jack would be legally entitled to the money from that point and if she tried to harass him whilst he was collecting he could have simply got security to get rid of her no matter what her story was and from that point she would have had a difficult time identifying him let alone launching a writ.Unfortunately the film is based on the story that she takes him to court for half the money and the judge concludes that they married and orders them to live as a couple for six months. The film slides into silly juvenile acts of stupidity between the pair until they eventually end up as a real couple. Its based on the premise that all married couples are morons who argue with each other and that's the secret to a happy life of love.A chuckle here and there by the audience didn't buy it.

It's the idiot plot, a concept that ""Vegas"" indulges in like a free buffet dinner. The movie proves that what happens in Vegas should sometimes just stay on the cutting room floor. The movie stars Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher as Joy and Jack. Joy got dumped by her boyfriend while Jack just got fired from his job. Both needing a pick-me-up, they are convinced by their friends (Rob Corddry, Lake Bell) to take a trip to Vegas, and after one wild and drunken night, the two wake up in the morning to find each other lying in holy matrimony. Not only that, but while trying to end the marriage, Jack wins a huge jackpot after playing Joy's quarter, throwing a wrench into the divorce proceedings. Whoever gets the other to divorce them first is entitled to the money, and so the ""happy"" couple move in with one another and hatch escalating schemes in order get the other to bail out of the marriage first. Only if you've seen this kind of thing before, what do you think happens when they come back from Vegas? It's a contrived sitcom from the start. Even before I went in I knew what I was getting myself into. Still, if the movie was funny it would more than make up for the complete lack of anything new. I was surprised with the kinetic and wild energy that director Tom Vaughan brings to the opening Vegas scenes, as it almost made me think that this movie may actually be likable. But then these two idiots wake up married and the movie slows to a halt. They each find one witless and unfunny way after another to get on the other's nerves. Joy hogs the bathroom, Jack pees in the sink, Jack rubs his balls then handles food, Joy throws food at him. At one point Jack gives himself a black eye to show that Joy is abusive. The movie wouldn't dare do it the other way around because, of course, spousal abuse on a wife isn't nearly as hilarious. I don't know what's more insulting, that the movie finds this crap funny or that in the last half it expects us to buy this phony romance based on life lessons and profound understanding. And then you have Kutcher and Diaz, two likable actors forced to play with bottom of the barrel material. Kutcher seems to know the material is terrible and tries to be comedic in his own way but the effort turns out to be more obnoxious and over-wrought instead. And Diaz is just shrill and unpleasant. We don't buy it when these two turn from being incredibly mean and nasty to one another to actually understanding the other and so the romance just flounders. On the upside, Rob Corddry is in the movie and he is fastly becoming comedy's best supporting player. ""What Happens in Vegas"" is just dumb. I expected nothing less, was hoping to be surprised with more, but am completely un-surprised by what I got. Sometimes you just have to roll the dice and see what happens though.

66,commandercool88,"Doesn't win the jackpot, but not a bad bet.",6,7 July 2008,"'What Happens in Vegas' certainly isn't a good movie, but it's better than it has any right to be. It's another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, where almost everything you see unfold on-screen has that familiar ring to it. But when you have someone in charge who has the formula down pat, worse things could happen. And for what it's worth, 'Vegas' is a relatively enjoyable and harmless ride that's never boring.Though never quite reaching the point of hilarity, 'What Happens in Vegas' has enough laughs to keep itself from becoming too derivative. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz don't have great chemistry together, but they get by. And with the right comedic timing, we get several decent gags at their expense. Their funniest moments typically come courtesy of Queen Latifah's marriage counseling, and a couple bonus scenes before the credits roll keep things in relatively good favor. But perhaps most importantly, Kutcher and Diaz are watchable. Acting depth may not be their specialty, but they make do with the bland script they're given and prevent themselves from becoming completely unlikable. It probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the best friend roles played by Lake Bell and Rob Corddry steal many scenes they appear in.There's an art to the romantic comedy genre, as every entry is practically identical to the one that came before it. The trick is to present it in a new and refreshing way, create the illusion that this one is different from the rest. 'What Happens in Vegas' doesn't reinvent the genre, and there's nothing in here that seems original (fans of 'The Simpsons' should instantly recognize the set-up, just replace Homer with Ashton). And though you could probably recite the film without actually having to see it, 'Vegas' does enough to make for an entertaining ride without breaking any new ground.'What Happens in Vegas' is as predictable and bland as you would imagine, but if you go into this knowing what to expect, I don't think you'll come out feeling completely ripped off. Director Tom Vaughan and screenwriter Dana Fox know the genre well, and it shows. They deliver a by-the-books project but with enough spice and laughter that it never really wears out its welcome. There are plenty of better films for you to spend your money on, but if you're looking for something short and sweet to pass the time with, 'What Happens in Vegas' isn't a bad bet.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",What Happens in Vegas

I had to find out what Rob Corddry, Zach Galifianakis, and Dennis Miller were doing in a romantic comedy based around America's most overrated hotspot to visit: Vegas. This whole movie was essentially a two-sentence-long plot about a couple of crazy people who are dumb enough to get a shotgun wedding in a drunken haze, win a bunch of money, fight about who's money it is, go to court to get ordered to spend six months together or else forfeit the money, and find that even though they hated each other, they start to fall in love. Cosmo BS. They use the same horrible examples as millions of other romantic comedies (ie. Whining ""You keep leaving the seat up"" and ""I can't sleep in your disgusting bed."") and it just shows how dull these movies really are. Basically, the movie was just a validation for Ashton and Cameron to continue ""working"" as ""actors."" She does the WORST fake emotions I've ever seen in an actress BTW. The brief jokes by the aforementioned Corddry, Galifianakis, and Miller were not even enough to pick up the scenes they were in. The director pretty much made it clear that ""you're watching an Ashton and Cameron movie only, and as long as you're watching, you're stuck in their simple- minded world."" Don't bother.",What Happens in Vegas

Most importantly, the film works for me, and for several audiences that I had the privilege of previewing with. It's good, clean fun and I think you'll enjoy it.

I thought that Diaz and Kutcher's performances were funny and witty. It had a good story-line and it was very well thought out. I thought the fact that you got to see the wedding later on in the credits was a clever idea. Some of the scenes made me laugh out loud but other parts of the film were a little cheesy and very predictable. It was funny how similar reasons brought them to the same place.

73,dmanyc,Divorce yourself from this film.,1,3 April 2009,"What happens when you try to combine romantic comedies with the humor of Judd Apatow? This!!! Ashton Kutcher is playing yet another slacker and Cameron Diaz is playing yet another perky career/party girl who meet in Las Vegas after he gets fired by his dad and she gets dumped by her fiancé, marry each other after a few hours and a few too many drinks, and are forced to make their quickie marriage work for six months in order to keep the three million jackpot that Ashton wins with Cameron's quarter. Each has a best friend/sidekick (a terrible lawyer for him, an angry bartender for her) that are suppose to have more personality than the leads, but instead they are just as annoying, if not more so, than the leads. Both sides plot to end the marriage so that one or the other gets the money, so they do just about anything to do so. Towards the end, she gives up her half and wants out of the marriage altogether. Meanwhile, he falls in love with her, so he follows her to her favorite lighthouse (I thought he would follow her to Vegas again), and wins her over in the end.Gee, who didn't see that coming? Just reading the reviews or watching the trailers you can pretty much figure out the whole thing. Watching the whole thing just makes you feel lousy. Ashton is basically playing the Kelso role and, let's face it, he really doesn't have much of an acting range. Cameron is also getting too old for this romantic comedy stuff. Not that she has much of an acting range either. All she ever does is give a goofy smile and shake her tush. You really feel for Dennis Miller, Denis Farina, Treat Williams, and Queen Latifah for getting stuck in this mess.

She gave a good performance here and I enjoyed both hers and Ashtons performances because it's very relatable
First the Dumping scene I can very well relate to having this actually happen to me when I was young which led me to hate woman
So I can very much relate to how she felt at that point in time
But this movie also has shades of several very identifiable movies
The Wedding Singer - the dumping scene and the reuniting scene
Shallow Hal - the sleezy lawyer friend doing everything he could to break the two of them up
Maid in Manhattan and Shallow Hal - the reuniting of the woman and the man
Laws of Attraction (with Julia Anne More and Pierce Bronson) the party and waking up married scene
There might be other connections to other movies but off hand they slip my mind
Overall the movie was very relatable and both my wife and I throughly enjoyed The movie because many of the scenes documented our lives as well
The lottery three million win scene (we actually did that too in reverse - was down to my last coin so gave it to my wife - that coin paid for our entire stay at the hotel we stayed (food supper bed and breakfast) sadly no where near three million though - she won the exact amount covering all our expenses)
The popcorn scene (sharing popcorn- my favorite meal - it's MINE
The toilet seat scene - everyone married couples fight
The bathroom waiting scene (likewise)
I think we all have experienced those situations
The judge ruling was fair
It was these small nuggets that made the movie for us

But still I must admit that the value in this movie is the protagonist couple . I'm not a fan of neither Diaz nor Kutcher but I must admit that both are perfect throughout the movie. It is this masochist relationship what unites them that make supportable all bad jokes, the bad performances, the predictable screenplay and the unfortunate direction of Vaughan.All I can say is that it shows that there is a connection between the two main characters and that is sufficient to withstand the hour and a half and the feeling of ""that he had seen in other 400 films"".

Lets get one thing straight in romantic comedy movies, the stories are always a half baked thing. So in short the film relies on its Stars to make the story move forward with their charistmatic characters.By now we are no strangers to Ashton Kutcher & Cameron Diaz. We know there acting capabilities very well, considering that, they deliver over the top mediocre performances.What happens in Vegas is a story of two people, Joy Mcnally (Cameron Diaz) and Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher), who both are facing problems in there life, Joy McNally just got dumped in her relationship and Jack Fuller got fired from his Job. Both of the characters decide to move to Vegas for some fun & forget about the things for a while.Both Joy McNally and Jack Fuller meet each other, get drunk and accidentally get married. Now both realizing that they are married want to get rid of each. But wait in vegas, Jack hits a Jackpot in the machine and considers himself to be lucky, when Joy makes him realize that his property is also her property because they are married.Now you've the glimpse of the story & you may predict what can happen next.No surprises there. The story is, as you may call it old wine in a new bottle. There are some funny scenes in the movie, the film knows its audience very well and its aimed at the age group of 13-22, which will find it pleasing, others who are looking for a much more depth romantic comedy might wanna miss this one & can watch Meet The Parents Or Meet The Fockers or even 27 Dresses again.This is definitely rent material, which keeps you entertained or maybe not,depending on what were you expecting, which as previously told, the film knows its target.See it laugh at it & forget about it & thats about it.",What Happens in Vegas

82,jhobdell,Great fun!,7,14 May 2008,"OK, I'm assuming here that anyone that's seen a trailer for this film knows the basic premise: girl and guy seek escape in Vegas, get hitched and then fall foul of the legal system (well, this particular judge anyway). That basically means that there can be only one logical path for the film: verbal and behavioural bitching, all-too-brief insights into respective histories and then a reconciliation. That's what you should be expecting even before you decide to see the film, and that's pretty much what you get.The soundtrack is great (and that's high praise from me): it all just seems to work with the film very smoothly (including the opening track from Mika, whom I can't stand!) Diaz and Kutcher have great chemistry (possibly better when they're being mean to each other but I'm not judging!) and I think the story works from concept to conflict to resolution very well. There are some great comic moments and the transition from hatred to understanding is almost touching. I might even recommend this film as a relationship guidance tool!",What Happens in Vegas

85,narine_tevosyan,Review,10,11 May 2019,"""What Happens in Vegas"" is a mix of sour and sweet, as Kutcher and Diaz's combat eventually turns to affection; the film also benefits from a great supporting cast. Rob Corddry, Queen Latifah, Dennis Miller, and Zach Galifianakis.
It is a romantic comedy and it tells about two people, who haphazardly got married in Vegas. They agree that a quick annulment is the sane course of action. But then they win a $3 million slot machine jackpot and things get complicated. They both want the whole money, so it's off to court. The judge determines that the newlyweds must live together and seek marital counseling for six months if they want to see any of the cash. So, after that both start plotting how to make the other crack and run screaming for the hills. And here starts a real comedy...
I really like the plot of this movie. We are so tired of these repetitive stories that such funny and new stories immediately become favorite ones. Thus, if anyone wants to see a movie full of funny and not repetitive moments, then you should watch this movie.
Another thing that I want to mention again is about the cast. I think that it is one of the attracting factors for the audience. We all know Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher. Hence, the reunion of these actors becomes one of the reasons why people like this movie. Also they perfectly play their characters. Despite the fact that I don't like Cameron, in this movie she plays well and I would not change this actress.",What Happens in Vegas

I would say that Ashton Kutcher acts like a buffoon throughout the entire movie, but that would imply he had some acting ability... which he clearly doesn't! Rob Corddry plays the balding, over-aged, sexually frustrated buddy that can't get l@!d to save his life! Lake Bell plays Diaz's sassy, wise-cracking b!&ch of a friend, but after her first two lines you just want to smack her about and kick her down the stairs backward! Dennis Miller plays the wise but cantankerous Judge that presides over the ensuing legal case, but he clearly looks about as thrilled with being in this movie as I was with watching it. Queen Latifah I can't comment on her performance because she doesn't really give one, if I'm not mistaken she is played be a cardboard cutout that they propped in the corner of the room! Everybody else is just as pathetic, including Treat Williams and Dennis Farina, both of which whose talents are wasted in this movie.Diaz's performance is the only worthy thing in this entire movie (even the music sucks). She is her usual charming self and she actually pulled off some of the emotional scenes she has in the movie.

I felt depressed that the girl (Cameron Diaz) was acting for better and charming though her faces sometimes looses being bigger when she smiles. Jack (Ashton's Dad) performed very natural. Although the theme was to send message about marriage sans sex but it again comes back. I saw a BBC documentary which was referring to Pagan past and I see reflection in this message. Had the story been more natural and less dramatic it would have been better, I felt that I am watching a movie, in case of Titanic, I was part of the movie.

Especially funny is the appearance of one of the Daily Show reporters, Rob Corddry, who plays a similar character in this movie. This movie is not sophisticated picture, it is more on par with Dude, where's my car? which also starred Ashton Kutcher. Of course, as with all Hollywood movies of this kind, it is very predictable. But that's not the point. This movie has lot's of laughs with some pretty wacky scenes and a hilarious cast. There is only one flaw that I think is making me rate this movie lower than I would otherwise have done: It is the racist depiction of Asians: The beautiful Michelle Krusiec is displayed as an extremely unlikable co-worker who is only interested in her career. This unfortunately alludes to a stereotype of Asians in America. As a suggestion for the future, I would like to see multi-ethnic casts also in the leading roles.

Many of the scenes were hammy and resembled something from a low budget modern ""National Lampoon"" movie. Cameron Diaz's commitment to her over the top emotional scenes just made her look foolish in context, but that wasn't any worse than Kutcher not even trying for most of his, but at least he seemed somewhat aware of the tanker he was riding.

97,ymghali,didactic?,7,18 May 2008,"obviously most viewers agree that it's a funny movie, which is fair enough. however, i want to tackle a different issue here, the ever so beautiful Cameron Diaz character starts the film as a woman who plans meticulously for everything, her work, her bf birthday party ... etc. She's so busy making plans about plans to the extent that she begins to lose any sense of happiness in her life. there's a famous saying in Arabic which when roughly translated means ""it is impossible to please everyone"". i won't spoil the film for those who haven't seen it and would like to watch it and consider this ""didactic"" or serious angle. apart from that ""What happens in Vegas"" delivers what it promises: some fun and a few good laughs. perhaps the chemistry between Ashton and Cameron has to do with it. what i liked most though was that the director chose not to bore us with too many scenes in Vegas which is great.",What Happens in Vegas
98,ConnorMonteith,Funny yet simple,7,22 March 2011,"""What happens in Vegas"" is about 2 people unexpectedly meeting up in Las Vegas, and after getting drunk, getting married. The next day, none of them can remember the night. Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) and Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) - the now pronounced married couple - turn up in court after Jack wins the jackpot $3,000,000. They are sentenced to 6 months hard marriage, and must attend regular counselling sessions. If they manage to live together for the whole time, the money is split. But if one of them asks to get out of the marriage, then the money is rewarded to the other person. So they each make the other persons life hell to force them out of the marriage.The film is a perfect mix of romance and humour. The film is pretty predictable to the viewer, but that doesn't make it bad. It's not a typical Hollywood flick. It may be basic with storyline and humour, but somehow it still appeals to many people.Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher both play fantastic roles as always. In the film, they both act about 10 years old, playing jokes on each other, and just having a good time. They play there characters incredibly well. In my opinion, Kutcher has played his most energized performance to date.""What happens in Vegas"" is an exceedingly bright comedy, and Diaz and Kutcher seem to work well together and have fun playing their roles with each other. The start of the film is basically like many other film set in Sin City, but it eventually settles into a rhythm.Tom Vaughan - the director - structures this film in a way that makes it enjoyable compared to some other similar RomCom's. I recommend watching if you have liked previous RomCom's. Something about this particular film makes is stand out from other classic movie's.",What Happens in Vegas

However I didn't like it.Like in all American films there are the crap ones, the alright ones, and there are the brilliant classics.It's funny in places, but not funny enough for you to still be laughing at it in a years time, or even after you come out of the cinema.Another reason why we went to see it was because Ashton Kutcher is fantastic in comedies, he was brilliant in 'Cheaper by the Dozen' And of course Cameron Diaz was in it and she's a good actress.If you're looking for some laughs and you've got nothing else to do on one rainy day go and see it.

Rather, it falls in the predictably simple romantic comedy. If you have seen one; you have seen them all.What's good about this movie ? Some laughs in the first half. Uncomplicated storyline. Ashton Kutcher's energy (god bless mama Moore). Decent side kicks.What's bad about this movie ? Cameron Diaz's bot-ox. Editing could've been snappier. Simplistic Vegaxploitation. Mild racial stereotypes.Why did I see it ? We were on a team lunch+movie outing. This was the only one that filtered out through preferences - as the lowest common denominator. However, I don't think any of us regretted watching this in the end.Bottomline, if this movie is in your radar for some reason, it's watchable. It delivers what it promises, but that's all.

101,Rolsrois,well i must say,8,9 October 2008,"the idea was original, it kinda reminded me ""The break-up"" with Vaughn and aniston, but it was way more entertaining.

Though i read what critics have to say, i never make a choice based on what they do say - for they are Critics after all.It was IMDb that actually got me to consider that this movie was not worthy to watch. I used to look at ratings at Movies.Yahoo but now i rely on what IMDb has to say, and when i saw the 5.0/10 rating, i was like; Wow! this must not be that good then.However, when i had no other options, i decided that i'd give this a go. And boy am i glad that i watched it. It is the best comedy to come out in a really long time, and i mean that 100%. It was fast - comedies loose their charm when they tend to go slow on you - quick in getting to the main story instead of lagging us on and on, and surprisingly the Vegas section was pretty small which was actually a Plus point! The acting was superb, some of the scenes were just hilarious, and others were great. The ending was expected, but then for such movies it is...All i can say is that it was after a really long time that i watched most of the movie again and again (yes twice) right after i had completed it.In short... if you want to have a great time and some good laughs then give this a go.

The storyline is obvious with two people getting married on a drunken night in Vegas and then regretting it. And there's obviously a Vegas win with money involved.

Of course, since the movie is tended to collect money from as large portion of audience as possible, there are also a lot of teenager kind of jokes. But after all it was good entertainment since there was also a lot of original humour. In addition, as you know romantic comedies usually irritates men (mostly) with oversweet and commonplace story, especially the ending.

107,jordanhunt1990,A fair gamble.,7,15 January 2012,"'What Happens In Vegas' is one of those common passing comedies that performs well financially but fails to establish any kind of legacy. Despite this, it has an immediately fresh premise which unfortunately dovetails into a predictable affair.After a raunchy night in Vegas, two very different people wake up married, and three million dollars richer. When a court order forces them to work on their communion, a battle of the sexes begins to each win their share of the cash.A hilarious first act provides the laughs that slowly become less consistent when a disappointing change of pace occurs. The script remains sharp and witty, with Diaz and Kutcher playing their annoying characters, well annoyingly; however the stellar introduction is so entertaining that it raises the bar too high. The original spin of 'What Happens In Vegas' is steadily diminished by cliché as the climax approaches. While audiences will have seen it all before regardless, had it been executed with the same frantic energy throughout then it could possibly have been salvaged by relentless humour.Clever writing, alongside genuinely funny jokes (and even some admittedly clever toilet humour) make this comic caper worth a watch. It is simply a shame that the cast nor the screenwriters could accommodate a rough transition from comedy to rom-com, a genre in which it is difficult to offer the element of surprise.7/10",What Happens in Vegas
108,jackmuley,Better than you'd think!,7,14 July 2008,"I know what you're thinking-- this is too high of a score. And I would have agreed with you. That is, until I actually saw this movie.I had no desire whatsoever to see this movie, and when the reviews came in that the ship was sinking, there was no convincing me otherwise. Then it came to the dollar theater and my wife pleaded. Her reasoning was that even if it's awful it's only a dollar, right? So I resentfully went along with some friends of ours. Surprisingly, half-way through the movie, I'm not annoyed with it. In fact, despite every urge to call it crap based on pre-judgments, I find myself laughing out loud. It wasn't a fluke either. Our whole theater was laughing. Because it's a funny movie.It was a good comedy-- no question. Usually I can't stand Cameron Diaz, but she seemed fine to me. Ashton Kutcher was his usual stupid yet charismatic self, and Rob Corddry was the highlight for me. Every single time he got on screen I was guaranteed a laugh.So for those of you looking for a comedy that is actually funny, look no farther. This movie just fell victim to being rated on the same scale as the Godfather, when people should really rank it from 1-10 based on what they expect from a comedy.Wishing I could-- 7.5 out of 10",What Happens in Vegas

Cameron maybe is becoming older but she still quick some asses, she looks gorgeous in the film, and those blue eyes, oh my god, she is perfect.

Many reviews for this movie where truly awful, but I had heard decent reviews from ""normal"" people. Once again, critics have proved the sheer cynicism of their professional title.This movie was very enjoyable on many levels, and I caught myself smiling at numerous scenes. Now that being said, this is in no way a classic romantic comedy. The pros of this movie had to have been the SURPRISINGLY good acting and chemistry displayed by Kutcher and Diaz. However, the bland and generic storyline prevents any special movie blossoming.I use one rule when trying to gauge a particular ""middle of the road"" film like this one. Would I buy it? The acting and humor are good enough for me to watch repeatedly, but the plot is more predictable than a win for the opponent playing against the Detroit Lions. For me, this would not be a buy, but if you have a significant other this would be a thoughtful gift that wouldn't make you suffer at all.",What Happens in Vegas

Does not finish playing and just walks away because she is frustrated with everything that had happened. Ashton finishes playing it and ends up getting triple jackpot.After that they go to court and try to sort out the problem of who gets the money. The judge orders them to have 6 months hard marriage.I found this film to be just brilliant. I have seen this movie many times and it just never gets old.Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher really work good together, so the screen performance was great.It has a good storyline to it and it goes with the title itself. This could happen to you. Maybe not the exact problem but something similar to it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in seeing it.

But there was one redeemable quality of this movie, which was its message, which it was able to deliver without being too preachy.Too many people today seem to have forgotten what marriage is really all about. They think it's an arrangement that's supposed to be convenient, like some living fairy tale where you meet the perfect person and fall in love and then everything is perfect for the rest of your life. But the fact is, far more important than finding the right person for you, a successful marriage depends on the work you put into it. This movie takes two people who hate each other, marries them, and then forces them to work it out; basically the opposite of how people normally do things today. I'm not going to say if they do work it out (that'd be a spoiler), but the important thing is that they have to try, which is something that too many married people today have forgotten how to do.",What Happens in Vegas

The premise is simple: drunken people get married in Vegas, but can't get annulled for some 'crazy' reason. ALA: Friends, Laws Of Atraction and many more. Diaz and Kutcher are both lacking something in this film. Diaz (again) relies on shaking her booty and being the same ditzy character that she is in so many of her films, but I felt this lacked the pizazz of her earlier films, such as The Sweetest Thing and Charlies Angels. Kutcher falls into the same 'pretty boy' trap of being a roguishly attractive man, and this role (and film) are almost identical to his 2003's Just Married - but this film is worse. The film was just off in so many places, displaced laughs, ongoing jokes that aren't funny, and the compulsory 15 minutes of immature escalating pranks. Most of the 'laughs' are in the trailer. What Happens In Vegas... takes its time getting to the conclusion, too much time, for a normal ending. At least this film knows what it is, and it doesn't reach for the stars. It is a simple romcom, but not a memorable one, and one you will have seen a few times before. Save your $13, and check out What Happens in Vegas... on DVD.",What Happens in Vegas

I can't stand it when reviewers (even amateur ones) try to be all serious and review every movie as if it's Citizen Kane. C'mon. We all know what we're in for. This movie isn't some serious Oscar contender, but it's not meant to be. It's a fun, light romantic comedy so let's judge it's merits on what it's trying to be. Kutcher and Diaz are solidly two of the most charming comedic actors in Hollywood these days, and pairing them up together is brilliant. Most of the time you see one of them paired with an actor who only dabbles in comedy. Here they totally hold their own with each other, and their stars shine equally bright. The whole set up of the movie gives them free range to scheme and have at each other and it's hilarious. They have great chemistry together, and they are great fun to watch. While the beginning of the movie stretches plausibility a bit, it's forgivable because it sets up the fun, and the reasons why they are ultimately good together are surprisingly solid. The two supporting actors are just as funny, whether they are plotting with the stars or just battling each other like snarky 12 year olds. And the romantic part of the movie is breezy sweet. So if you just want to laugh and enjoy a few hours, spend it with Ashton and Cameron. As a bonus, they both look phenomenal here.",What Happens in Vegas

Ashton Kutcher plays the usual role, Cameron Diaz looks good and acts bad as always, Rob Corddry is hilarious in a secondary role as Kutcher's bumbling lawyer friend and the very attractive Lake Bell provides some more wit as Diaz best friend.Overall, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed the majority of it (with the exception of a few, forced sappy moments).Worth my money?

Through a series of implausible circumstances, his winning a $3,000,000 slot machine jackpot, and a nut case judge, they can't get the marriage annulled for 6 months.

I've used IMDb for a long time now, I think it's a great way to see if the movie really is worth watching. So before watching ""What Happens in Vegas"" in the cinema, I thought: ""Hey! Maybe I should go to IMDb to see if it really is as funny as the trailers."" And what did I see... A rating of 3,6 or so.Well, I watched it anyway, and believe me I'm not sorry that I did it at all. Okay the movie might look as though it is a remake of Just Married, and it might be filled with clichés... But the acting of Ahston Kutcher, Cameron Diaz, and also the acting of their friends makes me forget all about it. I was laughing pretty much the entire movie, and you really get to feel with the persons throughout the story.But even though it's successful, it is hard to overlook the fact that it is filled with clichés, it is not a masterpiece in an original way. And yes if you've ever watched a romantic comedy, then you can sort of guess the ending pretty much from the beginning. But as I've said before, this didn't spoil the experience,it just made it an average movie with high above average acting, and in my case, a movie to which I had way too low expectations.So I urge you, go watch it, and revisit IMDb, and give the movie a rating it truly deserves.7/10.",What Happens in Vegas

At the last minute I relented and went expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised after 10 minutes my fears were dispelled and I actually started to enjoy the film. The basis of the film was predictable but the way the 2 central characters draw you in surprised me. They worked very well together and played off each other very well. Yes there are 1 or 2 silly scenes but it was still funny.I think the best thing about this comedy was that it left it up to the audience to draw their own conclusions on the characters of the central characters without laying (on as Hollywood usually does)it on heavy with the romantic or schmuty character embellishment.Just a funny story with 2 ( 4 including the supporting friends) very good comic actors.

128,mtmc5-1,Surprisingly funny,8,16 September 2008,"After reading critic's reviews, I stayed away from the theater but put it on my DVD list. Very few Romantic Comedies surprise me and I expect the same formulaic endings - that's because they are Rom Coms and that is why I enjoy watching them. It's the value of the journey that gets the audience to go along with the expected ending. I'm surprised many panned this film just because it was the same old formula. Did it occur to them that most people going to this genre expect, even desire, to see it play out in the familiar, happy ending way? Well, I do.Having very low expectations, I watched the film hoping to at least stay awake until it was over. I was delightfully surprised. I found myself laughing out loud several times - something rare in most of the comedies recently produced. I enjoyed the entire movie and watched it again just a day or so later. It was just as funny the second time. I thought there was great chemistry between the leads, the supporting cast was wonderful, and the actors made an improbable story believable.Thank you!

A pleasant rom com to pass 90 minutes. However, since being in quarantine and rewatching I must say that this film really accomplishes everything it sets out to do. Great soundtrack, the chemistry between Rob Corrddrryy and Lake Bell is fantastic, and Ashton and Cameron work well together. The Vegas scenes are great and you almost wish that was the whole movie.

And after getting married, back in New York it's just freakin' hilarious. The popcorn-in-the-pants-scene really cracked me up. So I think there are a lot worse movies with also worse plots. I mean after he falls in love with her, alright, that happens in 99% of the Hollywood-Romance-Comedy-Movies.So overall...funny movie, and for people who loved The heartbreak Kid, Fools Rush In or Three to Tang it's definitely worth while watching this flick.Later",What Happens in Vegas

The sad thing is that big paychecks seem to outweigh delivering quality product these days. I haven't written here since ""In The Name of the King"" which was a deplorable piece of crapola. Amazing what is getting released these days and even more amazing that the perps who contribute to these scams are not held more accountable...a sign of the times i guess. If we, the lil people, we're accessories to a crime, (like this film) we'd have to at least do some type of retribution or community service. Since this movie was not funny and it is advertised as a ""comedy"" i think someone should be held accountable for false advertising. Perhaps this movie should be relocated to the drama section...but it would only stink of that section too! I hope the distributors of this film are forced to put a disclaimer on the DVD box that says, ""Warning: Not suitable for anyone with good taste"" or perhaps, ""Warning: This movie may cause depression and anxiety"".

In Las Vegas, they both try to forget their sorrows and marry each other  drunken. When Jack hits the jackpot with a coin of Joy the next morning, both think the 3 million dollars should be theirs. They want to divorce to get half of the money in each case, but the judge puts a spoke in their wheel and sentences them six months of forced marriage.I first didn't want to watch ""What happens in Vegas"", but was voted down by my friends. Expecting a mainstream love comedy, I was  a bit  surprised by this movie.The main actors  Ashton Kutcher as Jack and Cameron Diaz as Joy  work well together and the other actors do a good job as well. Only one bad performed scene spontaneously comes to my mind: Joy's fiancé doesn't appear very authentic saying that he drops his girlfriend.The story is inventive and transacted very well; the film offers more twists than I expected. It isn't excessively funny, but there are some scenes and gags that make you laugh.So once again a film you can but must not watch.",What Happens in Vegas

Diaz and Kutcher really rock together and their side-kicks do a great job as well. The scene montage of Diaz and Kutcher on the town in Vegas partying is absolutely priceless. I was having an absolute blast along with them the whole time. Plus, the movie really works and it is touching to see the lovely couple begin their relationship being totally unreasonable about everything and then move gradually toward working through the issues they must work through with reasonable solutions. They both grow up through the process and it is realistic and moving. Go see this one it is just terrific.",What Happens in Vegas

Ashton Kutcher is awesome in his role a chocolate hero with innocent personalty. Do not forget the role of Rob Corddry as a lawyer you will see his best performance in it. When talk about the story of the movie, it is very simple and straight about a couple who were married when they are unconscious and then the chemistry between them start.

Most of the scenes are great because it shows how fun Las Vegas is and the plot is very strong. I enjoy all the characters because they are so funny. Cameron Diaz is a very good actress and she shows that in this movie. Joy play by Cameron is a workaholic person and always has to have a schedule for everything. Her fiancé Mason played by Jason Sudeikis tired of her and all the routine, so he breaks off his engagement with her. On the other side we find Jack, played by Ashton Kutcher a person that only thinks about how to have fun and do not take any responsibility or relationship seriously. They coincided in Las Vegas after having gone through difficult experiences. Due to misunderstanding, they were put in the same room where they met. They went out all night together as if they had known each other for a long time I really liked that part, but the worst part was when they woke up in the morning to discover that they had gotten married. I liked all the funny things that they did in the next part of the movie, because they won 3 million dollars in the jackpot and now they want to get divorced. In the end of the movie, they try so hard to hate each other that they fall in love. I think this movie is for people who are more mature.

I did not like Cameron Diaz as much but she is so pretty I can't stand it. I like how they actually become better together and I believed it. A lot of Romance movies are not to be believed because they are not accurate to real life. This one is silly but still was good and had heart.

One of the biggest surprises is that this comedy is actually... funny! It's as funny as unfunny was The Break-Up (2006), another comedy on the similar theme.The highlight of the film is the nicely comedic duo of Kutcher and Diaz. They are believable in this movie. It's a huge compliment from me :-).What Happens In Vegas is not a masterpiece, of course, and all its merits become evident only in comparison with the bad comedies that usually appear on screen for the last 10 years, but I don't begrudge ""8"" to this romantic comedy.

Rating: 3.5/5
Genre: Rom-ComRemember ""Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu"" starring Kareena Kapoor and Imran Khan? I didn't either until I saw ""What happens in Vegas"" but with more bewitching and legal drama. The lead actors of the film are Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher, directed by Tom Vaughan.After Joy (Cameron Diaz) being dumped by her finance and Jack (Ashton Kutcher) getting fired by his father, both decided to take a trip to Vegas. Due to technical hassle, they happened to end up in the same hotel room which was just the start of a serendipitous turn of events in their life.After a series of misunderstandings, they decide to hang out. The next morning, both realize they are married to each other, in a state of being pot-valiant by the liquor they had. And for a bonus check, they won a three million dollar lottery.No intention to share the lottery money, the decision is off to the court.
But the Judge adjured to wait for six months and seek marital counseling to sustain their newly married life.With intense plotting and planning against each other to win the whole bonanza, the story makes its way to cheer up our minds. In their journey, they experience conspiracies, courtroom & workplace drama, and ultimately love.""The Holiday"" movie star Cameron Diaz at her best with conspiratorial, but endearing co-actor Ashton Kutcher succeeded in entertaining the audience with their positively refreshing performance. Even the supporting actors will bring a smile on your faces. Apart from acting, the plot was quite predictable as almost every rom-com movie is. My favorite part of the film was when they start to bond with each other and surprisingly fall in love. It's the most awaiting moment for any romantic movie lover.You will definitely like this film you love to watch a fun romantic comedy. Even if you prefer other genres, this film will not make you bore!",What Happens in Vegas

Ashton Kutcher is not one of my favorite actors and the movie only had a five-star rating on this website. I opted to decide for myself, because the rating system is not always accurate in my opinion. There were no boring spots in the film and it was well-written, smart and not too long. Even my husband, who is not a big movie fan, thought it was entertaining. This is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a very long time. If you are looking for something makes you smile when you leave the theater, this one is for you!!! In fact, I would see it again with a friend if I have the chance.

Ashton Kutcher I'm still trying to decide if he is funny or not?Two of them together should be a perfect match you might think but not. The chemistry is just not there. The movie starts of great but just get boring and predictable as longer the movie gets. Forget this movie if you want to have a laugh. The jokes and comments are not the best, maybe 1 or 2 scenes worth a laugh. No i was disappointed by this movie and the remaining 30 minutes I was just waiting for it to finish. If you are looking for a fun movie with original characters watch forgetting Sarah Marshall. Thats a funny movie",What Happens in Vegas

Any movie that can make three uptight lawyers laugh for two hours straight deserves a rave review in my book.I did not really expect to enjoy this movie. I thought I was sick of Ashton Kutcher, and while Cameron Diaz has always been appealing and non-threatening despite her beauty, she's been around for a looooong time for someone who still looks that young. However, the greatest thing about the movie was its repartee between these two actors. Their insults flew fast and furious and were clever, with a well-timed delivery that was really funny. The movie is a romantic comedy that is heavy on the comedy. The romance is there, but very sweet and unlike the usual formula of misunderstandings and scheming would-be lovers. Instead, the couple learns to love one another after seemingly hating one another, by discovering and appreciating why and how the other got so annoying in the first place. This was quite touching in the midst of all the slapstick.I was surprised to find I LOVED this movie and will definitely go see it again at the theater. And buy the DVD.",What Happens in Vegas

The story line is a very good one, and superb acting skills of Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher. I could not think of a better couple to play the parts. I did find the ending however a bit plain and simple, but then again the 85% made up for the poor ending. But do not let this put you of, because the this film is a funny one.

Ashton was so goofy and funny and Cameron Diaz was just as funny as she was in Something About Mary. If you went to this movie expecting some kind of beautiful love story or something other than what it is, a funny movie that kills a little bit of reality, then you just went to the wrong movie.

Also it is a good training for your facial muscle. It's because there are some funny moments in the movie but as soon as it's over you forget what you were laughing at. If you see it on a larger scale it's totally waste of time because you've probably seen it all before. Love then hate then love then a little bit of fighting then love then getting married. Again, see this movie only if you have an atrophy of your facial muscles...in the end all I should say: Nothing new in the rotten sequence of Hollywood's romantic comedies.

151,richie-wall,Mixed opinions i see - i loved it,9,2 September 2008,"Before writing this review I read a lot of the others and what a mixed bag there were. I suppose it just goes to show that everybody has their own taste and viewpoint. Hence reviews by critics who slate films we all love - I'm sure it's happened to all of us at some point. I loved Last Samurai and Paycheck they were both slated and the same goes for this film.I do agree on one thing with the negative reviews though- that is after all the laughs and mickey taking and great connective acting the end is a bit typical romantic comedy. In fact reminded me of 40 Year Old Virgin hilarious for the first 2/3rds but last 1/3rd more like a romantic comedy.What I would say about this film if you were thinking of hiring it - is go ahead and if you're halfway through and haven't laughed stop the DVD and go put Wedding Crashers or whatever does make you laugh on. For me I was laughing out loud lots like most people in the cinema that day.I think why I laughed so much is that it used very relative comedy to a situation that when you hate the other gender for whatever reason they become even more annoying. The comedy used in this film concentrated on those stereotypical male/ female things we do when rebelling and made them hilarious from either perspective.I, like other reviewers but yet opposite to one or two other reviews felt what makes this film well worth the space in your DVD cabinet is the excellent connection the two lead characters make. I also felt that it wasn't a typical plot and felt unique in the main (for the first 2/3rds!).Well that's how I saw it but remember if you don't see it that way there's always plan B - Wedding Crashers!

""Vegas"" doesn't claim to be a great drama or packed with action. It promises humor and romance, and delivers on its promise. The leads have great chemistry and it's clear that they had a good time filming (it doesn't hurt that the leads are gorgeous).The plot is easy to figure out, but fun to follow. There are also some great lines of dialogue- funny, and insightful.I strongly suggest this movie for anyone needing a relaxing two hours or a good laugh. Guys would probably be a bit bored by the romance, yet entertained by the occasionally crude humor. The movie would probably be best appreciated by a GNO (girls night out).

It wasn't an amazing plot and it seemed to be lacking in a few areas but a good romantic comedy doesn't need a strong plot. The casting was great and the team up between Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz was great. Ashton Kutcher is easily able to create a comedic standpoint right from the start and it can be described as his classic goofy nature. Cameron Diaz played her role well as a serious character that turns out to have a wild side. Overall nothing about the movie makes it stand out in terms of romantic comedies but good acting makes it a good movie.

Cameron Diaz and Kutcher have no chemistry, their duo is neither funny nor romantic, the whole movie appears synthetic from start to finish. How Cameron Diaz got involved in this flop I don't know. Queen Latifah and Treat Williams add little. This movie is as bad as Patick Dempsey's Maid of honor, So save your money for something that is actually humorous and well acted.",What Happens in Vegas

My arguments: -excellent plot -excellent play of actors, all actors (especially respect to HATER:)) -while watching it you'll laugh a lot. For sure. -it'a story everybody wants to believe in.

If they drink they have to drink responsibly like adults, not irresponsibly. I think most young people have to watch this movie but it is perfect for everybody. The movie provoke us to reflect before we drink, and makes you think about family and other people that love you. It only took a couple of hours of having fun for them to cause a lot of troubles and destroy their lives in a way. They don't know what to do living together like partners; their entire lives changed 90%because of alcohol. But you know, they found the love in different circumstance, not like Romeo and Juliette. But life is not always like it is in that movie. Not everybody who drinks, like that and, a lot people drink and don't get those kinds of problems some are responsible When they drink.

Anyone can watch this movie if they try to have a fun time, but I don't think is appropriated for kids 13 years old because of some of the words they used in the film. If you like comedies you are going to love this movie. This movie makes you feel like you are in Vegas: exited, happy, and a little romantic.

Im not saying that this movie is all that better or even different from that, but its one of the few in the genre that actually made me laugh out loud a couple of times.The story is pretty plain, 2 people have to go on with this drunken Vegas marriage to get the 1,5 million each that they won, they struggle hard to make the other one give up on it. This is the setting for most of the film and it gives the viewer some really familiar every day situations pushed to the extreme, the interaction between Cameron and Ashton is working out well all through the movie, they really seem to be having fun acting their parts.I don't understand why this movie is at a 5.1 rating, sure its nothing new, sure its not the best storyline you have ever seen, but its good clear fun if you are looking for just that, nothing more nothing less.",What Happens in Vegas

I started watching it expecting completely nothing at all....and boy was I surprised. I feel confident enough to say that I'm by all means, a movie buff...I watch any and all genres...but I found this movie such a delight to watch...its definitely and rightfully so, A FEEL GOOD MOVIE. It is pretty light-hearted fun on the surface but my my...it makes you feel the love brewing in the air. The exchange of dialogues at the end even gave me a wake up call onto how I actually view love. I highly recommend this for smiles,laughs and emotions you'll never forget. Simply fantabulous!!! 10 out of 10 for me....because it just made ma day...wait i think ma entire year actually!",What Happens in Vegas
166,lobotaku-1,A very funny movie!!!,9,13 May 2008,"I saw this movie today and I can say it's a very funny movie. Surely, isn't the next Oscar winner, but it's a very enjoyable movie that can make you laugh and laugh for like 2 hours. The actors are very good on their roles and let's be sincere: Ashton Kutcher IS funny! And Cameron Diaz make it funnier even if she's not so funny if she don't have good actors working with her. If you like love comedies you should see this movie, but if you are looking something more brainy...keep walking. Give it a chance! You won't regret. And keep an eye on the secondary roles, because they are as great as the main characters. I hope they work together again as soon as possible,meanwhile I want the DVD release!",What Happens in Vegas
167,bubblegum105105,actually not so bad...,9,17 May 2008,"I went into the movie thinking it would be horrible and stupid but actually came out loving it. It's one of my favorite movies now. It was hilarious and very cute. The jokes were very funny and Jack's(Ashton's character in the movie)friend and lawyer added a lot. Camren and Ashton had great chemistry. It was pretty predictable but not to the max. They are both great and talented actors. And there was a lot of different age groups during the movie:teens,kids,20s,30s,and people in there 40's and the theather was pretty full, considering that it came out a while back. Everyone laughed histarically through out the movie. It's definitely worth seeing. 10/10",What Happens in Vegas
