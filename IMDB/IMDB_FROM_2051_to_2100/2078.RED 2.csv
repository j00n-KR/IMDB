0,Leofwine_draca,"Sorry, it's just not funny",4,15 December 2015,"RED 2 is a follow up action film which reunites various cast members from the first movie. Once again the joke is that a group of ex-operatives, now suffering from the pangs of advancing old age, are called into action once more when their lives are thrown into danger. To be honest, I preferred COCKNEYS VS. ZOMBIES which at least had fitfully amusing OAP action.RED 2 makes for pretty soulless entertainment, all big CGI explosions and endless shoot-outs with nary a drop of blood, the latter a deliberate choice to pander to the PG-13 market, of course. It feels superficial and overlong, and it doesn't help that Bruce Willis gives yet another disinterested turn. Still, he's a good deal better than walking facelift Mary-Louise Parker, and the continuing embarrassment that is Helen Mirren.The supporting cast fare a little better here and at least Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox are making the effort. The less said about Catherine Zeta-Jones, who's made quite the career of appearing in silly, light entertainment Hollywood films, the better. Best of the group is Korean action man Lee Byung-hun (A BITTERSWEET LIFE) who makes something special out of a stock assassin type role. Byung-hun has the most dialogue I've heard from him in an American film and he's funny to boot, as well as being deadly, of course. Some of the action is quite well directed here but the overall result is still lacklustre.",RED 2
1,SnoopyStyle,Some more fun and some more funny,7,13 December 2013,"Frank (Bruce Willis) loves the settled suburban life, but girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) pines for the exciting action. Marvin (John Malkovich) drops by complaining that Frank hasn't killed anybody in months. Before Marvin could convince Frank to return, he gets killed or did he? Helen Mirren returns, and this time adds on Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Neal McDonough. But it's Mary-Louise Parker's comic timing that drives the movie. There was a taste of it in the first movie, but this time around, she's able to be front and center for the whole movie. Her character's need to get action drives Frank crazy, and drives the movie from a simple blow'em up actionrama. She is funny, and she has a great chemistry with the stoic Frank. Their chemistry was the best thing in the first movie, and is still the best thing in this movie.",RED 2
2,Prismark10,Retired but still more dangerous,6,3 December 2013,"RED was a refreshing hit film with old retired spies getting back into action. It had the sight of Helen Mirren blasting the bad guys. It was all tongue in cheek.RED 2 is more of the same. No Morgan Freeman but we have Oscar winners Catherine Zeta Jones and Anthony Hopkins joining the team.Therefore we have the potential prospect of Brian Cox (Hannibal Lecter Mark 1) sharing the scenes with Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter Mark 2.) Alas no dialogue is shared between these two.RED 2 gets into gear swiftly and the action moves from the USA to Paris to London and Moscow. There are again sinister CIA agents hunting for them along with MI6, Iranians and Russians as well as Byung-hun Lee playing one of the world's top hit men.Malkovich provides most of the humour this time round and Hopkins plays the jailed scientist who might be not as endearing or befuddled as he makes out to be.It all moves swiftly along but there is a sense of seen it all better in the first movie despite a few twists.",RED 2
3,claudio_carvalho,A Sequel that Keeps the Level of the First Movie,7,22 December 2013,"The retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is in love with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) and enjoying their normal life in two. Out of the blue, Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) meets Frank in the supermarket and tells that the Wikileaks has released the information that they had participated and know the whereabouts of the Nightshade, a portable nuclear weapon that was smuggled in pieces and hidden in Russia. Now the top agents on the world are under contract to seek them out to know where Nightshade is. The trio travels to Paris and teams-up with the Russian Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to track down the former Russian Agent The Frog (David Thewlis) to get more information about the operation. They learn that the brilliant inventor Dr. Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins) might know where the weapon is. They discover that Bailey has been interned in an asylum in London by the MI-16 for thirty-two years and the British Victoria (Helen Mirren) joins the team. They rescue Bailey and find that the nuclear device is hidden in the Kremlin. Soon the dangerous South Korean Han (Byung-hun Lee) joins the group expecting to retrieve the weapon. But the dangerous killer Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) is hunting Frank down and will not stop until he recovers the nuclear bomb. ""Red 2"" is the sequel of ""Red"" that keeps the same level of entertainment of the first movie. The plot is full of action and humor and works perfectly, supported by a stellar cast and magnificent locations. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Red 2: Aposentados e Ainda Mais Perigosos"" (""Red 2: Retired and Still More Dangerous"")",RED 2
4,nogodnomasters,"WHAT HAPPENS IN THE KREMLIN, STAYS IN THE KREMLIN",10,23 October 2018,"The film incorporates Wikileaks as the new problem child for Moses Frank (Bruce Willis) and company. An article claims he and Marvin (John Malkovich) were involved in a 1979 operation called ""Night Shade."" They have become wanted men.In an expanded role Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) our meek lady from Kansas has become a thrill seeker and joins the group as they travel the world to find ""Night Shade."" In addition to Interpol and the Feds looking for our heroes, there is also a hitman (Byung-hun Lee) after them and Victoria (Helen Mirren) is also contracted to kill them...Malkovich proclaims ""Friends don't take out a contract on friends."" They are allied by KGB agent Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to the displeasure of sweet innocent Sarah who says...""Can't we just kill her?""The film is filled with Malkovich one liners which we enjoyed in the first movie. The expanded role of Sarah added to the feature. This is perhaps a notch below the first installment, but a worthy action-comedy sequel that will be in my collection when it comes out.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. One half spoken f-bomb.",RED 2
5,kosmasp,Older but not more relaxed,7,23 May 2014,"Maybe a bit wiser though. We get some new characters in this, a bit of a typecasting takes place, but it does pick up where the first one left off. Did you like the first one? If you remember it and the mix of fun and action, try to imagine this amping it up a bit. Bruce Willis is most charismatic, when he is with his back against the wall, something the movie is very aware of.It's also nice, that we get even more female power in this one, instead of them just hiding. There was some of that in part one, but it's another one that is amped up. It's still all PG-13 and that is more than OK, you don't need this to go overboard, because it might have lost it's touch with the comedy part",RED 2
6,classicsoncall,"""Two shots, here, and here. Drag the body in there and repeat as necessary.""",10,30 November 2014,"The first thing I was looking for here was to see if they found a way to bring Morgan Freeman back to life from the first film. Instead, John Malkovich is killed off and resurrected, then teamed up with Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren and a new cast of characters to bring adventure, romance and danger to this unpredictable assassins flick. I have to admit, I get a kick out of this kind of mindless fun when the writing is creative and the dialog complements the action with wit, sarcasm and self deprecating humor. The set up is perfect with Marvin Boggs (Malkovich) enticing Frank Moses (Willis) back into the espionage game by reminding him that he hasn't killed anybody in months. From there, it's pretty much non-stop nonsense in the way of chases, explosions and martial mayhem until the hero team saves the world from Red Mercury and restores the world's balance of power back to normal. I wouldn't normally rate an action flick this high, but RED 2 distinguishes itself for it's sheer audacity in attempting to make the unbelievably absurd look like just another day.",RED 2
7,lee_eisenberg,"ready, set, fire",7,6 October 2014,"When I saw the original ""RED"", it was a bit of a shock to see tough guy Bruce Willis and high-brow Helen Mirren co-star. Like its predecessor, ""RED 2"" is not a movie that you can take seriously. It knows exactly what kind of movie it is, and so it goes all out. This time, Bruce Willis and his band of weirdos have to locate a missing nuclear warhead. There's no realism here, just two hours of gunfights. But this movie is basically a joke, so it's OK. The aim is to entertain, and it succeeds 100%. As before, John Malkovich's character is the best one in the movie. Above all, it's fun to watch the gaggle of characters travel all over the place in their task. It would be a fun movie to experience were there not the risk of getting shot to death.I recommend it.",RED 2
8,jboothmillard,Red 2,5,26 July 2021,"The first film was relatively good fun, I kept missing the sequel numerous times on television, and it was meant to be a little better, so I was relieved when I finally got to watching it, directed by Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest, Fun with Dick and Jane, Bill & Ted Face the Music). Basically, three years have passed, and ex-CIA operative Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), who is listed as RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous), tries to lead a normal life with girlfriend Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) tries to convince him that enemies are still after them, which Frank dismissed. Marvin supposedly dies in a car explosion, and Frank delivers a tearful eulogy at the funeral. Afterwards, Frank is interrogated by government agents at an FBI facility, which is ambushed by corrupt agent Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) and his military team. Horton makes threats against Sarah to Frank, who escapes the facility, with the help of still living Marvin, and goes on the run with Sarah. Marvin explains he and Frank have been targeted as members of Operation Nightshade, an operation during the Cold War to smuggle a nuclear weapon into Russia. Horton convinces international agencies that Frank and his associates are terrorists on the run. Frank's old ally Victoria (Dame Helen Mirren) notifies him that she has been contracted by MI6 to kill the fugitives. Meanwhile, top contract killer Han Jo-bae (Lee Byung-hun) is given a contract to kill Frank as well. Frank, Marvin, and Sarah steal a plane and fly to Paris to find ""The Frog"" (David Thewlis), with the US military and Han in pursuit. They meet Russian secret agent Katja Petrokovich (Catherine Zeta-Jones), with whom Frank had a relationship, who is also investigating Nightshade. The Frog gives them the key to his security box, which Katja takes after drugging Frank. But Marvin substituted the real key for a fake, anticipating a double-cross. They search the box themselves, finding documents about physicist Dr. Edward Bailey (Sir Anthony Hopkins), the creator of the Nightshade bomb. Bailey is alive and has spent thirty-two years in a maximum-security asylum for the criminally insane in London. Victoria, alerted by Marvin, ambushes the trio, but helps fake their deaths and infiltrate the asylum. They find the hyperactive Bailey and, whilst drugged, bring him to Marvin's safehouse. Bailey remembers the bomb is in Moscow, hidden in the Kremlin. There, the team locates the suitcase bomb, powered by red mercury. Katja stops them, but Frank persuades her to join their mission. They escape, but Victoria calls them and reveals that Bailey was imprisoned because he wanted to detonate the bomb. Holding Frank at gunpoint, Bailey confirms Victoria's message, admitting he made a deal to give Horton the bomb. He shoots Katja, frames Frank, and leaves with the bomb. Horton goes back on the deal an intends to torture Bailey for all his secrets, but Bailey deploys a nerve gas inside the plane, killing everyone aboard. Bailey, however, administers the antidote to Horton and escapes to the Iranian embassy in London. Frank and Han have a standoff, Frank urges Han to join him in stopping Bailey. Eventually, Han gives in, and the five enact a plan to recapture the bomb and fly to London. In London, with deception and a diversion, the team learn the bomb's location, but Bailey has already triggered the timer and killed Horton. Bailey takes Sarah hostage and flees to a plane to escape. Frank, Marvin, Victoria, and Han chase Biley, but Marvin's attempts to disarm the suitcase bomb causes the timer to count down even faster. Frank boards the plane and confronts Bailey with the suitcase; he forces Frank to leave with Sarah and the suitcase. But Bailey was tricked, the suitcase was empty, and the bomb was hidden aboard the plane; the team watch from the ground as it blows up in the sky. Han angrily demands $30 million for his plane and $20 million for not killing Frank. It ends with Sarah enjoying herself on a mission in Caracas with Frank and Marvin. Also starring Brian Cox as Ivan, Garrick Hagon as Davis, and Tim Pigott-Smith as Director Philips. Willis and Malkovich do fine, Parker gets more to do, Mirren kicking ass is fun, and McDonough and Hopkins have fun as the villains. The story of a nuclear device that must be stopped is alright, the gun play, fight and explosions are engaging, and there are amusing moments, it is a slight improvement, a fun action comedy. Worth watching!",RED 2
9,Tweekums,Silly but lots of fun,8,4 May 2017,"This sequel sees retired agents Frank Moses and Marvin Boggs in trouble again when an article on Wikileaks mentions them in connection to a Cold War mission known as 'Operation Nightshade'. Shortly after Marvin warns Frank he is apparently killed and Frank is captured and is threatened by Jack Horton who says he will torture his girlfriend, Sarah, if he doesn't say what he knows about Nightshade. Before long he is rescued by the not so dead Marvin and the two of them, along with Sarah, head off to find out the truth behind Nightshade. It won't be easy though; the CIA have hired contract killer Han Cho-Bai to hunt them down and MI6 has asked their old friend Victoria to hunt them down. The story will take them to Paris, London and Moscow and will involve finding a long hidden nuclear weapon. The protagonists will find themselves working with some unlikely allies and one of the people they trust prove to be the most dangerous.Anybody wanting a gritty action thriller will be disappointed; as with the first film there is lots of action and plenty of thrills but it was definitely a comedy even the scene where somebody is dissolved in an acid bath is played for laughs. The action is delightfully over the top with lots of shooting, fighting, chases and an explosive finale. The cast does a fine job with Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich and Mary-Louise Parker make welcome returns and are joined by the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Byung Hun Lee all of whom bring something good to the proceedings. While the action is fairly bloodless there is a high body count which some viewers doesn't sit well with all the comedy and the child-friendly UK '12' certificate personally I doubt it will offend many people as the action is of the 'James Bond' style. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of action who don't want anything unpleasant in general and fans of the first film in particular I certainly enjoyed it.",RED 2
10,BA_Harrison,More of the same.,7,20 January 2018,"RED 2 sees old-timer ex-black-ops CIA agent Frank (Bruce Willis) reuniting with his ex-colleagues to try and find a missing nuclear device that was smuggled into Moscow in the '70s. Also along for the ride is Frank's girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), who can't get enough of the exciting espionage lifestyle. Meanwhile, numerous people try to kill Frank and his pals.Let's be honest, people don't generally watch this kind of film for the plot (which is a good thing because the story for RED 2 is a forgettable, scattershot affair, leaping all over the place): they watch it for the all-star cast - which this time around features Anthony Hopkins, David Thewlis, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Byung-hun Lee - and for the ridiculous action scenes, of which there are plenty.Fans of the first film will no doubt have a blast as this film delivers the same mix of comedy and violence as the first film, with highlights being Han destroying numerous vehicles with a mini gun, a car chase through Paris, and an exciting high speed pursuit down a British motorway. Like the original, this sequel is perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours, but the rapid pace and constant change of scenery ensures a consistently fun time for the duration.6.5 out of 10 for Byung-hun Lee: he might have been included to appeal to the Asian market, but he's easily the best thing about the film, the Korean actor shining brighter than the Hollywood stars.",RED 2
11,blanche-2,can't help loving it,8,9 August 2013,"Red 2, a sequel to the popular Red, has Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, and John Malkovich back in the saddle, with Willis, Mirren, and Malkovich again dragged into their old jobs. Parker, who became Willis' girlfriend in Red, insists on going along.This time the group is called upon because one of their old missions, Nightshade. The purpose of Nightshade was to smuggle a nuclear weapon into Russia piece by piece. Marvin Boggs (Malkovich) informs Frank Moses (Willis) that there are people following them, but Frank, interested in a normal life now, doesn't buy it. However, the second time Boggs returns to try to convince him, Boggs' car blows up and Boggs seems to be dead.After Boggs' funeral, Frank is taken to a facility and questioned. A man named Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) enters the facility and starts obliterating everyone. He wants info from Frank, but the not dead Marvin breaks in and gets Frank out. Now they're on the run, with Sarah.Victoria (Mirren) tells them she has accepted a contract from MI6 to kill Frank. She's not the only assassin. A major hit man, Han Jo-bae (Lee Byung-hun) gets a contract on Frank too from another source.Victoria, who helps burn their car) It comes down to finding the inventor of the bomb, trying to find out where he hid it, and get it before opposing factions can use it.Action-filled, funny, and wacky, with a tremendous cast that also includes Anthony Hopkins, this is a wonderful film, done in several European locations, so the scenery is great. I just wish Helen Mirren had had more to do. She's a scream as the chic, glamorous Victoria, wandering out into the road wearing fatigues and carrying a rifle, talking on the phone while pouring acid into a tub, and shooting two guns, one out of each window.Everyone is terrific. Highly recommended.",RED 2
12,tavm,"I got plenty of enjoyment out of the sequel to Red, Red 2, what with all that action and humor that abounded",8,28 July 2013,"So Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker return for this sequel to Red with Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Anthony Hopkins along for the ride. Once again, some kind of terrorist act is gonna take place and it's up to the above-mentioned cast to either save the world or maybe a couple of them to betray the trust. Don't want to spoil that part so I'll just say that there's still plenty of humor to go along with the action set-pieces that one has seen before but one always gets a thrill out of because of the way it's all set up. Oh, and there's also one more character from Hong Kong who I didn't know about but he's really good with what they show of him here. So on that note, I recommend Red 2.",RED 2
13,hitchcockthelegend,Its important to enjoy life while you still can!,7,19 January 2014,"Retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his retired but extremely dangerous operatives are back to face danger again. There's a nuclear threat to be snuffed out but things really could go either way...It's pretty much more of the same really, which apparently hasn't been enough for some critics who wanted a different movie. It's not as if this is lazy, yes it's still Frank and his aged assassins fighting old age as well as an outside threat, but there's a flip-flop in plotting and the additions of Anthony Hopkins, Byung-hun Lee and Catherine Zeta-Jones are most welcome. It's also so nice to see the adorable Mary-Louise Parker get a substantial part this go around, while Helen Mirren (still sexy and gorgeous in her late 60s) is delightfully sociopathic! Red 2 is full to the brim with acting talent who are in on the fun joke of it all. Action is never in short supply and the pace is never allowed to sag by director Dean Parisot. The characters remain strong thanks to the screenplay (Jon and Erich Hoeber) and the airy humour is consistent and keeps the violence grounded. Basically, this is a hugely enjoyable ball of action based froth. 7/10",RED 2

16,view_and_review,Move Over Bruce!,4,14 October 2014,"After watching RED I knew with absolute certainty that I wasn't watching RED 2. Needless to say, since I'm writing this review, I watched RED 2. Well, at least I can say I didn't pay for it.RED 2, like RED, was a high octane, shoot em up movie big on action and small on story. The only differentiating factor that separates this movie from so many others is that the main characters are all AARP members.As I pondered upon why I didn't like this movie compared to other action movies that I did like, it hit me: I don't care to see sexagenarians parading around like Jason Bourne. Your, or anyone's, rooting interest in this movie lies solely in one's like or dislike of Bruce Willis and gang. I haven't seen a Bruce Willis movie I like since Unbreakable (although Surrogates wasn't too bad). Bruce is just too old to keep doing this stuff and he fails to reinvent himself. What, is he going to be 80 years old still knocking out trained killers and killing bad guys? At least Clint Eastwood had sense enough to go a different direction. Even in the movie Unforgiven, Eastwood played an over-the-hill gunslinger that operated very much in the boundaries of an over-the-hill gunslinger.All I ask is that Bruce and company leave the action to the youngsters. Bruce, man, it's time to move over. Let the young up-and-coming draft picks get a chance to play. I know that you, like Brett Favre, don't like to leave the game, but guess what, it's time for others to shine.",RED 2

By- the-numbers sequel to what could've been an engaging franchise has Willis and most of the first film's cast reunited (and cashing a paycheck since most are sleep-walking thru this lackluster action/comedy) to stop a lethal weapon of mass destruction from detonating (i.e. saving the world).

18,neil-476,More fun,8,9 August 2013,"3 years ago, in RED (Retired and Extremely Dangerous), retired agent Frank (Bruce Willis), aided and abetted by, among others, fellow retirees LSD casualty Marvin (John Malkovich) and aristo Brit Victoria (Helen Mirren) found himself caper-bound. This involved kidnapping payroll clerk Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) whose initial reluctance turned into enthusiasm, and romance blossomed. Now Frank and Marvin find themselves framed, and the ill-matched group find themselves on an international hunt for something they have never heard of while trying to avoid assorted people out to kill them.To be honest, the plot doesn't matter (which is just as well as it doesn't make as much sense as it should). What matters is the script (which is very enjoyable), the chemistry between the players (which is great) and the action (not bad).When performers are having fun, it can be bad news for the audience: self-indulgence does not necessarily equate with good entertainment. Here, the cast are all clearly enjoying themselves hugely (Anthony Hopkins in particular, as loony scientist Bailey is having a ball) and, within the discipline necessary to make a comedy action movie, it works very nicely.There are those who rate it less enjoyable than the first one - I don't agree. It doesn't have the element of surprise the first one did, but it is still very entertaining - the audience when I saw it clearly enjoyed it a lot. An interesting difference is that, whereas Willis' Frank was the centre of the first one, here he is merely one of the ensemble. Because this is a true ensemble piece.",RED 2
19,Uriah43,Failed to Live Up to the Hype and Level of the First Movie,5,14 October 2013,"""Frank"" (Bruce Willis) and ""Sarah"" (Mary-Louise Parker) are just trying to lead ordinary lives when ""Marvin"" (John Malkovich) appears out of nowhere and is subsequently killed right in front of them. After the funeral Frank is arrested and taken to a facility to be interrogated about a top-secret project he supposedly had knowledge of in his former capacity as a CIA agent. Unfortunately, while being interrogated, a group of trained assassins break in with the intent to kill him. He manages to escape and this results in a race by certain governments to either kill him to contain the information or to capture him in order to acquire the information. Now, although this film wasn't necessarily bad, I personally believe that it failed to live up to the hype and the level of the first movie. For starters, there were too many characters thrown in with not enough film to go around for all of them. That said, I liked the addition of both Catherine Zeta-Jones (as ""Katja"") and Anthony Hopkins (""Dr. Bailey Evans""). But Byung-hun Lee (as ""Han Cho Bai"") wasn't needed and his performance was too clichéd and unpolished. Likewise, the reintroduction of ""Victoria"" (Helen Mirren) and ""Ivan"" (Brian Cox) was too obvious and clumsy. Further, the main characters who made the last film a success weren't given the material that played up to their strengths. For example, Frank wasn't the baddest character on the block-Han Cho Bai was--and it diminished Frank's status somewhat. Likewise, Marvin wasn't nearly as crazy or funny and Sarah seemed to lose the two things that made her special in the first film-- her innocence and vulnerability. So essentially what we had was a collection of characters thrown against the wall to see which ones would stick. And some things just didn't seem to work. In short, it wasn't as good as the first movie. I rate this movie as average.",RED 2
20,anaconda-40658,Not Quite As Red As the First.,6,5 August 2015,"Red 2 (2013): Dir: Dean Parisot / Cast: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones: Entertaining yet routine sequel reprising most of the original film's veteran cast. Bruce Willis returns as Frank Moses who is trying to live a quiet life as a result of his relationship from the first film's events. When Marvin appears warning that they are being followed Frank brushes him off. When Marvin's truck explodes in a parking lot Frank doesn't believe he is dead. His assumption is true especially when Marvin turns up again when attempts are made on their lives. Central plot regards a secret operation codenamed Nightshade that regards a nuclear bomb that is hidden somewhere in Moscow. Simple setup becomes progressively detailed with several plot turns and much humour. The climax is clever as intelligence is defeated by wit. Dean Parisot previously directed the underrated Home Fries, also about characters leading double lives. Willis brings forth his sly confidence as Frank who solves the plot but not without many attempts on his life. John Malkovich as Marvin provides much of the humour as he attempts to derail Frank's pull into the clutches of seductive vixens. Mary-Louise Parker as Frank's girlfriend is hilarious seeking excitement despite Frank's protests. Anthony Hopkins appears in a scene stealing key role as someone in an asylum who knows the whereabouts of Nightshade. Catherine Zeta-Jones also steals scenes and must collaborate when the crime becomes too complicated. Often silly action farce most appreciated by those who enjoyed the first film.

The title stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous, so as you might expect from watching the preview and seeing the cast list, this is one of those ""old guys still got it"" movies. In general, I love these movies, and with RED and RED 2 I was just as entertained as I'd expected to be. Ironically, the youngest man in the bunch, Bruce Willis, is the lead. I never think of him as being of retirement age, but here he stands among older old-timers: John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and Anthony Hopkins.As you know from the first movie, the gang is a bunch of retired CIA agents who are fighting to stay alive, because they know some pretty dangerous state secrets. Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker are still completely adorable together in the film, and when his ex-flame Catherine Zeta-Jones shows up, Mary-Louise gets pretty jealous! Joining the cast for the sequel are Neal McDonough and Byung-hun Lee, so ladies, you'll get plenty of eye candy in this one!RED 2 is just as funny, delightful, romantic, and exciting as the first movie.

The first movie, he grated on me a little toward the end.Willis is excellent and has proved he can get one sequel right this year, and the rest of the cast are looking like they are having a lot of fun.It gets a little silly toward the end, but when you have Hopkins overpowering a whole fleet of soldiers with his shoe, and Willis and Malkovich surviving a helicopter crash, you do suspend belief.Well worth seeing, although it's very violent...",RED 2

So it's up to Frank to get the band back together for a globe- hopping adventure to clear their names.What we have here is a fun, if forgettable, popcorn summer action flick. Nothing too substantial even if it's a (albiet ever so slightly) more entertainingly solid movie than the first RED film which was equally forgettable yet slightly less entertaining. But in a strange twist of fate, the non-action segments of the film feel more cartoonish than when explosions are going on.

The action goes through Paris, London and Moscow for some interesting scenery and chases. There is some laugh out loud funny dialog and situations. The gang work to stop a nuclear bomb in Russia.It's success comes from the fact that it doesn't rely too much on any one cast member so you get the good points of each. Bruce can still carry his action sequences quite well. So can the slim Helen Mirren. John Malkovich looks a bit faded and tired compared to the other two. The new additions include Catherine Zeta Jones who is slim and attractive but a bit tanned to be a Russian agent and Lee Byung Hun as a Korean hit man who provides the martial arts sequences that only a younger cast member could pull off. Mary Louise Parker isn't that natural a comedienne and her acting seems a bit obvious. Anthony Hopkins is a bit tired looking as a scientist.Overall worth a watch.

25,gradyharp,'Its important to enjoy life while you still can!',10,28 November 2013,"RED 2 equals or even surpasses RED! This is a movie for people who enjoy sitting back and being entertained by fancy camera work, a story that has a plausible plot, smart dialog (Jon and Erich Hoeber), astute direction (Dean Parisot), and most of all a cast of some of cinema's finest actors who look like they are having such a great time you don't want the at times rather silly movie to end.The plot, twisted and turned now and then just to keep us glued, is simple that of a retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. The team includes John Malkovich (absolutely hilarious role for him), Mary-Louise Parker (often stealing the show), Helen Mirren (gorgeous as ever and having the time of her life knocking off just about everybody who gets in her way). The other folks who are on varying sides of the law (nobody really plays by the rules) include Anthony Hopkins (in stellar form), Catherine Zeta-Jones, David Thewlis, Brian Cox, Byung-hun Lee (in a brilliantly choreographed martial arts role and the physique to match), Neal McDonough, and Tim Pigott-Smith among others.No, it is not deep, but it is silly and funny and entertaining and an exceptionally good time.

26,siderite,"Better done than the first, but less funny",7,10 November 2013,"The first RED movie was one over the top extravaganza of old talent. It was delicious to see the actors you love play it out like nothing matters, just for the fun of it. The story was impossible, but you didn't really care, because it was funny and entertaining as hell.RED 2 is more serious, with at least two villains (if you discount the Iranians from the embassy, who are OK to kill in droves just because they're Iranians) and some real dramatic scenes. It continues to be silly, but I felt like there needed to be more in order for it to be funny as well.The new additions to the roster are good, starting with sir Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, but also some of the younger actors like Byung Hun Lee and Mary-Louise Parker. Well, perhaps not Parker. Somehow her character was badly drawn and she was playing it all like she was still in Weeds.So, my conclusion is that this was a more digestible movie than the first RED, but also less faithful to the spirit of the franchise, as I understood it.",RED 2
27,DKosty123,Seniors in Fast Forward,7,2 August 2013,"There is a very cold war feeling plot here but that is what seniors remember. Catharine Zeta-Jones is the Russian agent. Bruce Willis and plenty of support come here in a tough in cheek plot about a dangerous nuke about to be set off in Moscow. There are some sub-plots as well. This sequel is not as deliberately paced as the first edition but still comes off pretty well. The jokes are funny and it has a fun feel.My feeling is this comes off a bit like an Ocean's movie but it is on steroid pace wise. There are plenty of con games going on between the good guys and the bad guys here.It flies so fast you have to work to keep up with the jokes. Sarah (Parker) is making out with every bad guy after husband (Willis) makes out with Zeta-Jones. All is done very tung in mouth.The one thing I can say for this movie is there's is plenty of action as it feels like it never stops from the opening credits moving along. This is the kind of film that you go into the theater to be entertained and you are, just do not take it serious.There are some new character adds compared to the last edition of the series and for the most part the additions are welcome.

28,Hellmant,The action scenes are awesome!,8,8 November 2013,"'RED 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2010 hit action/comedy film based on the DC Comics limited comic book series of the same name. This installment once again focuses on 'retired and extremely dangerous (RED)' black-ops agent Frank Moses (once again played by Bruce Willis), who must come out of retirement and join forces with his old team (once again). This time in order to find a missing nuclear weapon and clear his name (Moses and his buddy Marvin have been linked to the stealing of the device). Willis's all star cast of co-stars, from the original film, once again join him; including John Malkovich (as Marvin), Helen Mirren, Mary-Louise Parker and Brian Cox. Morgan Freeman (who's character died in the original movie) of course does not return for this installment but newcomers Byung-hun Lee, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Neal McDonough, David Thewlis and Anthony Hopkins do join the cast. Jon and Erich Hoeber once again wrote the screenplay but Robert Schwentke does not return this time as the film's director, he's been replaced by Dean Parisot (who's known for directing such hit comedy films as 'GALAXY QUEST', 'FUN WITH DICK AND JANE' and 'HOME FRIES'). I didn't enjoy the first movie much at all so I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this one (I think Parisot's directing was probably a big reason).The film begins with Frank (Willis) once again trying to live a happily retired life, now with his girlfriend Sarah (Parker), but trouble once again finds him. He's first tracked down by his old partner Marvin (Malkovich), who tries to convince Frank that there's people still after them. Frank thinks he's crazy but when Marvin is apparently killed Frank also finds himself kidnapped by government agents. He learns that his involvement in an operation, of smuggling a nuclear weapon into Moscow during the Cold War, has now come back to haunt him. People think he knows where the missing nuke is and is involved in it's disappearance. He must join forces with old team members, including an old flame named Katja (Zeta-Jones) who's also a Russian secret agent, while avoiding others who are now hired to kill him. Victoria (Mirren) has accepted a contract to kill Frank and so has an expert killer named Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun), who's bent on revenge against Frank. Hopkins plays a mentally ill physicist who may hold the key to the nuclear weapon's whereabouts. For me the original film was a lot like an action comic-book version of 'GRUMPY OLD MEN'! I found the jokes tired and old (but most of all forced) and I didn't think the action scenes were all that thrilling. I only saw the movie once though so maybe I just need to watch it again (from possibly a different viewpoint and mood). In my opinion this sequel improves on everything the first film got wrong though. The jokes are clever and witty, the characters are likable and fun to watch and most of all the action scenes are awesome. The addition of Byung-hun Lee was a great improvement but also I think Parisot is just a better director for this type of movie. It's still the same two screenwriters though, even though the dialogue and storyline seem a lot better as well. I had a blast with this film, I know the critics didn't like it as much as the original but the critics are often wrong. If you're looking for a fun and funny action film extravaganza (regardless of whether you liked the original movie or not) you might really enjoy this film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJalgBjCCrg",RED 2
29,thesar-2,Not 2 Much,7,28 December 2013,"It's really sad this movie was overlooked. I mean, I can see why they made it; 2010's Red was a cult hit. I really liked it and even bought it on BluRay for my limited collection.Now, granted, Red 2 isn't as great as the first one. For one, Morgan Freeman wasn't involved. But, it was thoroughly action packed, fun, funny and a comprehensive film.Basically, aging ex-CIA agents are called back into duty (again) to clear their names and must perform the same stunts/achievements shown in other movies, such as Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. Only this time, the big news is bringing the dull Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah along for the ride.Apologetically, it's been well over a month or so since I've seen this. What I do remember is that I had a great time. It's not perfect, entirely original and it's fairly predictably, but it's enjoyable. Just have fun here. If you liked the original film, you'll have a blast here.* * * Final thoughts: Earlier in the year, Bruce Willis starred in the worst Die Hard film, not to mention one of the worst action films I've seen in a long time: A Good Day to Die Hard. He looked really old in that film, as that was part of the idea for him being too old to be an action star. Mercifully, he looked great here – back to his old self. Sadly, he was the weakest link in this movie. While still good and kicking ass, he looked tired and defeated. I do not recommend a Red 3, but I am looking forward to another Die Hard with him back on track.",RED 2
30,Robert_duder,"A little smarter, a little sharper and still a lot of fun",8,9 August 2013,"I really liked the first Red as a lot of us did. It was a near perfect blend of action, humour, crazy stunts and wild characters. I was very excited for Red 2 and as I always do as of late I tried to steer clear of trailers so my expectations were very high. In a lot of ways Red 2 is very different from the first film. The humour is a little drier, a little less blatant, the story is far more complex and smart and the action is a little more realistic but still right in your face beginning to end. It is a well rounded, well made action flick with all of our favourite characters. It actually stands very well on its own even apart from the original. It simply has a darker tone but in all the right ways. As far as I'm concerned it stands pretty nearly equivalent to the first one but is great in its own way as mentioned previously. The film film might even be described as an comedy-action flick whereas this one I would simply classify as action and a great one at that. One thing is the same that makes the Red series so successful and that is the near perfect chemistry of this cast.I love Bruce Willis, always have. He is an action icon, easily one of my Hollywood heroes and I love when he does a great action flick. Unfortunately, it has been awhile. I thought the latest Die Hard lacked a lot so I was so pleased with him in this. He returns in full form and looks great doing it. His fight scenes are just perfectly Willis and his charisma on screen is just what you want from him. The bizarre and yet excellent chemistry between Willis and John Malkovich drive this film. Malkovich is great in his role but its a little different than the first time around. He is a little darker, a little less campy and crazy but gets more depth to his character and him and Willis are fantastic together. They are an action force to be reckoned with. Both lead the film with flawless precision. Mary-Louise Parker returns as well as Willis' beloved girlfriend. I enjoyed her even more this time around and the banter between her and Malkovich was fantastic. Her and Willis are surprisingly great together and watching her get involved even more in the plans was fun! She's so quirky and easy to watch on screen. Helen Mirren...what an amazing woman. This is such a great role for her and perhaps a big flaw to this sequel was that she wasn't in it enough. Still, even in a supporting role she got some of the best lines, and best scenes. The scene with her spinning in the car shooting baddies with handguns was instantly action film classic status. Mirren is awesome and terrific in Red 2 as she was in the first. Anthony Hopkins joins the cast and I wasn't sure if he would quite fit in...well he did...he was superb from the bizarre scientist locked away for decades to the character he becomes towards the end. He was deliciously perfect. Byung-hun Lee also joins the cast as new fresh young blood and while I sort of felt they forced his martial arts skills down your throat, he was still good. He added something to the cast without a doubt and him and Willis have some good scenes together. However, forcing the new blood into the cast felt like it held it back just a little bit. Neal McDonough is the latest right hand man and ""bad guy"" to the story. He does a great job and while I don't think he was quite as good as Karl Urban in the first film, he holds his own. I would have liked to have seen more direct fighting with Willis but he has an interesting character that develops well. Catherine Zeta-Jones who I feel is one of the most over-hyped actresses in Hollywood is a...Russian spy? I'm not sure why they cast her and I don't dislike her but I find her overused lately in small roles. She feels campy and I didn't like what she brought to the cast. I suppose I was unimpressed with her but its a small role.Director Dean Parisot has had some good films but from what I have seen of his this is certainly his best. That being said, I'm not sure he had too tough of a job. I think, as I mentioned before, that this cast is just so good together that it clicks. All he has to do is give it a little bit of style and direction. I felt like he, or the producers, were trying to pay homage a little more to its DC Comics roots which wasn't really necessary but it worked fine and didn't get in the way. The most I wanted from Red was a ton of action, ridiculous stunts, a car chase or two, world travel and settings, a dash of romance and humour and lots of Bruce Willis doing what he does best. Red 2 delivered that again and again so it easily met my expectations. It was a fun, solid sequel that absolutely made my day at the movies!! Plenty of memorable scenes and one liners and I hope to see them come back at least one more time and make this one a first rate trilogy!! 8.5/10",RED 2

It's more of the same, but that's not necessarily a bad thing when you're onto a winner.Once again, a bunch of aging spies are forced out of retirement in order to band together for humanity's greater good. No, it won't win any awards for originality and the plot won't tax your brain too much, but what it lacks in originality, it makes up for in fun.Yes, it's fun. That's all. It's not meant to be taken serious and anyone who tries will end up hating it. It's a bit like the old Bond films. We know that - deep down - these people would never be able to do the things that they do, but, in order to enjoy the film, we happily suspend our disbelief and allow ourselves to be swept along for the ride.It has a stellar cast - all recognisable and A-list - and they all seem to be enjoying themselves. This shows and helps the sense of fun. It may not be as stylish as the Mission Impossible films and certainly isn't as gritty as the new Bond films, but if you like your action films and enjoy seeing your heroes spout a few cheesy one-liners after despatching vast quantities of bad-guys then you should like Red 2.As I said about the original Red - any film where Dame Helen Mirren fires a machine gun is worth a couple of hours of my life.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",RED 2
32,dromasca,guilty pleasures,7,26 April 2014,"I must confess that one of my guilty pleasures is watching from time to time a movie like RED 2. I mean a movie that is made just for the purpose of entertaining, mixes action and comedy, brings to screen funny characters played by great actors, and is not shy about what it is meant to be. A movie that when watched feels like the actors and the team had themselves fun making it.Such a film is RED 2, the second in a series which if you ask me can go on and on. Yeah, there is a story here which does not really follow the path of the logic as we may know it. The cold war may be over, but our retired (or pretending to be retired) hero-spies continue to fight it, and its aftermath, among other a non-detectable weapon of mass destruction of yesterday which risks to fall in the hands of the bad guys of today. No fortress, spy agency HQ, prison or government palace remains un-penetrable for more then 100 screen seconds. In any city they travel to they leave a pile of corpses and a trail of destruction that would have granted them centuries of punishments under any jurisdiction – no charges are ever pressed, of course, because this is the world of the action comedy which has its rules or lack of rules of its own.I do not feel at all bad for this guilty pleasure of mine. Without any over-analysis I believe that I like these movies because they are sincere in their explicit intentions of entertaining – no more, no less – but actually this is very much. Then when well written and acted as it is the case here such films have a logic of their own. We actually do understand these retired spies and their run for thrill. The dialogs are well-written and funny in many moments, the situations follow well one after the other, and director Dean Parisot's succeeds to make a film that does not look at all as the work of a prime timer. All the big stars gathered on the same list of credits – Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Anthony Hopkins Catherine Zeta-Jones, Marie-Louise Parker – seem to enjoy themselves and this fact crosses the screen. If I am to recommend a fun and non-pretentious entertainment at the movies this would be one of them.",RED 2

It seems a nuclear weapon went AWALL and now the real terrorists want to find it. The CIA and contract killers are after them.Most of the film is just filled with silliness and jokes. And too many product placements. The pringles and papa john's were cringe worthy. I hate it when movies advertise because I'm watching a movie so I don't have to watch commercials. One of the craziest scenes was Han spinning the blue Ferrari and Victoria shooting the bad guys from both sides.

34,g-bodyl,John Malkovich Is Still Awesome!,8,25 October 2014,"It must be a thing nowadays to reinvent the careers of aging action stars and putting them together in an ensemble. First the Expendables franchise, now I guess we can call the Red films a franchise. I for one, is not complaining at all because it's good to see these aging stars kick ass despite the improbability. Now this film is the sequel to 2010's surprise hit, Red. While the first film is better and has a more concrete story, this film has it's own share of crazy action scenes and witty one-liners (thank you, Mr. Malkovich). While the plot may seem hectic at times, this is a fun ride and isn't to be taken seriously.Dean Parisot's film takes place three years after the events of the first film. Frank Moses is trying to lead a quiet life with Sarah who is now his girlfriend. When they are approached by Marvin who claims people are still after them, that is when things go downhill. Now the three must reunite with Victoria and together they must track down a missing nuclear device before it's too late.As I said before, it's always good to see our aging stars back together kicking butt and having a great time. Bruce Willis returns as Moses and does a good job on the action front. He has once scene involving him headbutting a table. John Malkovich is back as Marvin and never has a boring thing to say especially when it comes to women advice. Helen Mirren is slick as ever. Mary Louise Parker happily complements Bruce's character. We have some nice additions to the cast such as the great Anthony Hopkins as the villain and the sexy Catherine Zeta-Jones as a past love interest of Moses.Overall, Red 2 is really nothing new and the plot resembles plots done many times before. But is it entertaining? You can bet it is! It has no short supply of action, crazy stunts, and perfectly-timed comedy. It's not as fresh as the first film as it seems like this film has a different agenda, but I definitely would not mind a return of Frank Moses and the gang in a future installment. I rate this film 8/10.",RED 2

It's a lot of fun, simple as that, the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves and because of that I had a fun time watching it, it's a lot funnier than the original, does not take itself as seriously, much lighter on character development. The story is very simple and straight forward, but a star studded cast that includes Bruce Willis, John Malcovich, Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins make this a very enjoyable two hours. I did feel the story was really lacking in depth, it just seems to move along piece by piece, no moment is really significant or gratifying for the audience, it never tried to make this sequel stand out on its own. I did not enjoy the love issues which erupt between Frank and Sarah as a result of Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, it all felt very forced and created an annoying persona for Mary Louise Parker, making her nowhere near as cool as or likable as she was in the original, she was a strong character then, here she is simply a love interest. It certainly has its flaws but Red 2 mostly makes up for it with its pure fun and optimistic cast, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.

36,A_Different_Drummer,Another Sequel ... That Really Isn't...,4,12 November 2013,"Some assumptions. You saw RED. You liked RED. Combine the first fact and the second fact and we end up with a third assumption. You are checking out RED2 because you are expecting something akin to RED1. Foolish viewer. You have fallen into the most common trap that viewers are snared by these days. You have assumed that Hollywood works in a logical manner and sequels are extensions of what went before. Wrong. Hollywood, historians of the future will note, is a giant cash flow machine run by individuals so wealthy that, more often that not, they will tinker and toy with the workings of the machine just to make themselves feel more important than they actually are. This deep dark secret is the key to why so many sequels bare so little resemblance to the films that started the franchise. (Another analogy would be a xerox of a xerox of a xerox. By the time you get to the 3rd xerox usually made in some obscure place like Canada for 1/3 the budget of the original -- and it shows -- any similarity to the original is merely coincidental.) Which brings us to Red2. Red1 was a clever action film, built on a great premise, that worked especially well because of our familiarity with talent. Familiar talent. Old friend talent. Talent that releases happy juice -- serotonin -- in the brain when we watch. Red2, aside from being overlong, inconsistent, and based on the wacky ensemble comedies of the 60s, along the lines of ITS A MAD MAD MAD WORLD -- is a comedy with occasional moments of action. Big difference. The real surprise in the film, and a pleasant one at that, is Mary Louise Parker, the only actor in the project who looks like she is having fun, and the actor who consistently steals scene after scene from much more seasoned names. As she ages, and she ages well, she is developing ""cartoon eyes"" and she uses these time and again in the film to salvage scenes which otherwise would not be funny at all. There are so many things wrong here, I would exceed the IMDb word limit if I listed them all. Here is just a friendly tip to the producers if they ever try anything like this again. When you are casting a Russian agent (Zeta-Jones in Red2) it would be surprisingly useful to find someone that can actually do a Russian accent.

The first one felt fresh, with a terrific cast clearly on their A-game. The cast is on their A-game here as well. It just doesn't feel as genuine as the original did. This one throws in bigger action scenes, bigger gags, bigger everything. What made the original work so well was an above average story. The story isn't bad by any means, it's just not as strong as the original was. The action scenes do deliver. There is a car chase that takes place in Paris that will get your adrenaline pumping. The finale is loaded with action as well, including Byung-hun Lee's fight scenes. He has major potential as an action star. You may recognize him from G.I Joe (Storm Shadow ring a bell?) This certainly doesn't lack in the action department. Bruce Willis is a lot of fun as the lead, just like he was in the first one. His charisma shines in this one. Mary-Louise Parker's character has evolved a bit from the first movie. She pines for adventure, in lieu of being the mousy person she was in the first. John Malkovich is a blast. Helen Mirren doesn't have that much screen time, but she was classy and fun to watch. I got a kick out of her firing away two guns out window, while a car is in motion. Anthony Hopkins's character was a bit of a hit and miss for me. Catharine Zeta-Jones is not only sexy, but she steals many scenes, with her unpredictable character.

Red 2 successfully and smoothly balances the most difficult of art forms the comedy-drama in this fun and thrilling action ""summer"" adventure movie. Except for the final locale setting that seems rather odd and off-putting without much emotive audience attachment, this movie exudes both intelligent humor and surprisingly black comedy. Some of the action scenes are quite seriously portrayed unlike most action adventure comedies such as the Schwartzenegger's blockbuster True Lies (1994). The action and the chase scenes come across fresh and intriguingly innovative in their specific style of death and escape for the most part. The script hangs together well along with the double twist. There's a little for everybody, from screwball comedy offered up by John Malkovich and the more straight man comedy from Bruce Willis. There other woman Catherine Zeta Jones plays well with Bruce's current love interest played with goofy but restrained flair by Mary Lousie-Parker. Helen Mirren of course offers up her dry British wit, while Anthony Hopkins gets to reprise a more layered performance that can't be described without spoilers, though hints his rather surreal fantasy character as found in Slipstream (2007).Red 2 has the same entertaining action-oriented playfulness and character interplay found in Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005), but with the inclusion of so many primary characters, making for a more complicated pulling off standard which each of the actors seem to carry out their own strengths as comedians, especially Malkovich with appears to have incorporated some of his own off the cuff ad libs to perfection. There's even some of the mind-twisting, playfulness along with the underlying deadly threat found in Ocean's 11 (2001) trilogy. While some may look on incredulously with nauseating bewilderment with the seductive, poor woman (Parker) scene in persuading a tight-lipped man to come clean with information, even this perhaps one of the weakest points in the movie seem to come off nevertheless with its possible, humanity believability, a nice human touch to sometimes an otherwise cold hearted movie which even Bruce Willis gets to show some heart himself later in the movie towards the ""enemy."" Overall, this movie is captivating in its humor, appealing in its consistent delivery, and finely balanced more so in its delicate edgy comedy-drama display, among the best and the most riskiest of deliveries.",RED 2
42,nairtejas,When Dumb & Over-Smart Meet Each Other. ♦ 51%,5,14 November 2013,"The first installment was enjoyably good to watch and all the action it involved, coupled with some thought-ridden twists made it a good premise. The sequel just jinxes the whole idea.Mary-Louise Parker thinks she's inducing slapstick with her idiotic slapstick, but together with a ridiculous plot & improbable (read unbelievable) situations it just negates. Yes, we do have made-up stories of White House Down & Olympus Has Fallen, but at least they were entertaining. When you damp it up with glittery, ensemble cast who put in less to no effort (except Helen Mirren & Anthony Hopkins), you get RED 2. You tell me, what type of a contract killer is so bad at shooting and at the same time, dumb at assassination. Also, when you have a nagging girlfriend along with you when you go & try to save the world, the setting just distances itself from the audience. I tried to not pay attention, but the screenplay & editing came in the way.The last 25 minutes were worth the shot because we have car chases, helicopters, explosions & Russia; the climax although, looked sloppy. Even the humor didn't live up to the expectations. I laughed countably 4 times.BOTTOM LINE: Followers can wait for rentals. Others can watch RED first & humor themselves. This is one movie where everything seems nonsense and to an extent, are.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

43,The-Sarkologist,Some guys just can't seem to retire,8,25 January 2014,"Well, Frank has managed to elude his former employer who was trying to kill him after revelations of a rather embarrassing job had come to light, and is now getting ready to settle down once again to attempt to enjoy retirement with his new found girlfriend. Unfortunately he just does not seem to be able to get that rest, and the normal life, that he so desperately wants, and to add to the complications, his new found girlfriend actually wants to go out and have some more adventures, much to Frank's horror.The movie makes it very clear right from the beginning that Frank is extremely dangerous, namely by demonstrating that he is able to take out an entire squad of crack soldiers without a gun and while his hands are handcuffed. In fact that scene right at the beginning of the movie where he is ducking around a storage room full of files while the soldiers are trying to take him down is probably one of the best scenes in the movie. That does not necessarily mean that the movie goes downhill from there, but what it does mean is that it pretty much had me hooked right from the beginning.Once again we have an old mission to Russia come to light when a number of agencies are trying to find out what this thing about 'Project Nightshade' is all about, and of course they all go to Frank to try to get the answers. The problem is that Frank is as much in the dark as everybody else, and there is only one guy, who has been locked up in a mental asylum for the past thirty two years, that has any idea about what is going on.It seems like everybody is trying to get a piece of Frank, and poor Frank simply cannot sit down and live a normal life like a normal person, some that is clear that he really wants to do. In a way you feel sorry for poor Frank because there is some pleasure in being able to retire and just relax, and that must be more so for a crack CIA assassin. I wonder if these guys ever actually get to retire, or if their form of retirement is to be placed in a human sized box and buried six feet underground.",RED 2
44,Reno-Rangan,Big adventure than the first and entertains very well,8,28 November 2013,"The first installment was one of my favourite movie of the year it was released. It gave the new meaning and dimension to the action flicks of the present era. With fun filled tale which had many aged actors in the lead took to new heights. A movie like this can easily beat the mindless action 'A Good Day to Die Hard'.'Red 2' is an even bigger action-adventure which story moves all around the world from America to Russia and Europe. After trying to run the normal life, Frank realises he was targeted by some people. His friend joins him and also the wife, while figuring it out who it was the more characters comes around him and one of it was the famous Korean actor Lee Byung Hun. Because of him we are lucky to witness some real action sequences where the rest were old and strengthless (except Bruce Willis).The movie will entertain and it is cent per cent guaranteed. This is a great example how should be a good action movie, in the name of it many are giving a total crap. This one was not good as the first however very funny and will be better than one can expect from an action flick. It only made more curious about the third and I am anticipating more awesome actors to be in part of it. Hoping it will be one of a finest action-comedy trilogy ever made.8/10",RED 2
45,pennyelenabooks,not good enough,2,19 March 2016,"Even though Red was an interesting and innovating film, Red 2 fells sort, with chewed up plot and few twists. The main theme, apart from finding the bomb, is the romantic relationship between the main two characters and the emotional problems they are facing. However, I found it hard to believe that there was any chemistry at all between them. The constant changing of the costume grew to become tiring at some point and the show up \ show off of the characters, not to mention the comic book like sequences, were a minus for the film. Some sub plots were silly, like the one with the Korean assassin. I mean, he turned out to be a good guy, but if he was that lethal, then how on earth did Frank managed to fight him off by himself? So, 2 out of 10, because even the performances weren't convincing enough.",RED 2
46,leonblackwood,Loads of action and amusing in some parts. 4/10,4,30 November 2013,"Review: Bruce Willis really looked like he didn't want to be in this movie, and it seemed like he was holding back his usual wit and charm on screen. All of the other characters put in good performances, especially Helen Mirren, who looked great, and John Mallovich who was quite funny. I was a bit puzzled about the casting of Anthony Hopkins, but he also was great in the film and he really suited his role. The problem that I found with the film was that it seemed like an episode of a TV series like Mission Impossible or New Tricks, but with loads of action. You can really tell were all of the budget went, with all of the explosions and such an A-List cast, but it lacked punch and wit. The lady that plays Bruce Willis's girlfriend just became annoying and in the way. Apart from that, you do stick with the movie to see the outcome and so,e of the action scenes were quite good. Watchable!Round-Up: For her age, Helen Mirren plays a great hit woman and she makes the movie enjoyable, in her couple of scenes. It's good to see the funny side of Anthony Hopkins, after watching him playing so many classic serious roles, and it didn't seem like he was out of his comfort zone. One of the problems that I found with the film was Bruce Willis who just seems to walk through the movie not doing anything amazing, which was surprising because he was the main character. He does pull of some action moves, which was surprising for a man of his age, but he isn't like he was in the early Die Hards or Moonlighting. John Mallovich brought some comedy to the movie, like he did in the first Red movie, but he hasn't got anyone to bounce off, like he did with Morgan Freeman. Anyway, there is something for everyone and I'm sure that this isn't the last that you will be seeing from the Red franchise.Budget: $84million Worldwide Gross: $140millionI recommend this movie to people who were into the first Red, which also had loads of action and some comedy. 4/10",RED 2
47,TheMovieDiorama,RED 2 mistakingly hires double the amount of retirees and twice the bombastic action.,5,15 September 2019,"""Bigger is better"", so they say. Whilst that may apply to a variety of situations (televisions, equipment for after dark usage (if you catch my cold...) and Nicolas Cage raging his heart out), it doesn't necessarily work for sequels. Here we have a prime example of that ethos backfiring, with so much *stuff* happening that it becomes a clustered, splintered and hefty mess of global political proportions. The ol' RED team of new must team up again to stop governments from acquiring a WMD that could obliterate opposing nations, quickly and efficiently.My hyperbolic introductory paragraph is just that. Exaggeration. But it expresses my disappointment for this sequel considering the light character-driven fun that was portrayed in its predecessor. In all honesty, this sequel is fine. Neither bad nor good. A plethora of locales for action of the highest intensity to take place, including the mesmerising Byung-Hun spraying a symphony of bullets from a Gatling gun in downtown Paris. An extended range of cast members, ranging from Willis and Malkovich to Hopkins and Zeta-Jones, assembling an ensemble cast of cataclysmic proportions. Oh, and a myriad of real-life problems, from stale relationships woes to obsessive wine purchasing, enhancing the central spine of characterisation.Alas, it all comes falling down, quicker than London Bridge, thanks to a forgettably generic plot that intently focuses the narrative's agenda on worldly politics instead of the retirees. CIA, FBI, MI6, Russian Intelligence, and I'm ever so certain a Korean agency was mentioned too. It's a wasted opportunity, reeling off its unambitious predictable plot and twists, instead of honing in on what made the original so much fun. The characters. There are moments in which the juicy personalities are brought forward, particularly Mirren and Malkovich, yet handcuffed to a script that doesn't care. The constant switches between Paris, London, Moscow, Paris again, London again and nearly Iran, was messy to say the least. Never allowing the characters and story to simmer or take in the surroundings. A shame, considering Silvestri's score does much of the international embodying. Also, more Byung-Hun please. The man is a legend.To conclude, let's correct the introductory statement. ""Bigger is not always better, ya dig?"". It's an obvious step down from its predecessor, however RED 2 manages to maintain its light hearted escapades for a watchable, if forgettable, sequel. Can we appreciate Hopkins chewing up the scenery though? I salute you Sir Anthony!",RED 2

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,True to the original -- a perfectly watchable action comedy,6,26 April 2014,"Turns out they're not too old for this ****.""RED,"" the 2010 action comedy based on the DC comic, earned a deserved dash of praise for delivering on the fun of its concept of aging stars toting deadly weapons. ""RED 2"" does a job of equal measure, though it doesn't compensate for the loss of its novelty. Essentially, the sequel ought to please fans of the original, and everyone else will be no worse for the wear when all is said and done.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) are loving retirement, but their peace is quickly interrupted when they run into their old friend Marvin (John Malkovich), who tells them a document has been leaked connecting him and Frank to a powerful weapon from the Cold War era called Nightshade. Marvin and Frank become everyone's most wanted: American agent Jack Horton (Neil McDonough), Korean assassin Han (Byung-hun Lee) and even Victoria (Helen Mirren) are after them. So they take to Europe and team up with Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones), one of Frank's old flames, to track down information about Nightshade.Original ""RED"" writers Jon and Erich Hoeber are definitely responsible for the continuity in tone from the first film to this one. The sequel retains the dry wit of the first and the occasional tongue-in-cheek. ""RED 2"" also doesn't take itself too seriously, though it manages a few eye rolls compared to the first. And the plot actually keeps things interesting with twists, betrayals and the like, which is a huge asset when the story otherwise plays with overdone foreign espionage tropes. Director Dean Parisot doesn't add much to the film, though it doesn't exactly miss ""RED"" director Robert Schwentke either.The cast once again looks like it's having a total blast. Willis hasn't looked this relaxed in any of his recent action films; Malkovich is less crazy than in the first film and more lovable and Mirren is never more charming than when she's playing with guns. Newcomer to the cast Anthony Hopkins also gets more of a playful character role. Also, Parker gets to build on the ""in-over- her-head leading lady"" stereotype of Sarah more so than she did in the first film. In some ways she turns out to be the comic relief.""RED 2"" doesn't offer a whole lot of innovation or excitement as an action film. There is some clever and humorous fight choreography throughout, but it still leans on typical action sequences expected to be funnier given the age of the actors involved. Lee, who is meant to keep the action fresh, is one of the best in the martial arts business, but his skills go a little under-utilized.There are so many more ways to go wrong than ""RED 2,"" which if for no other reason, works by not overreaching, trying to be something it simply can't and being true to its concept. It's hard to see a whole franchise being built from something ""decently entertaining,"" but movie franchises have been built on much worse.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Have you seen the first, then you will enjoy the sequel.For all those who havent seen RED 1 yet, I can suffice to say that RED 2 is an hilarious parody on spy thrillers with a top of the line cast: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Anthony Hopkins, Cahterina Zeta Jones and Helen Mirren to name a few. Think of ""Expendables"", but with more class. Havent you seen ""Expendables"" either, then I can tell you that RED 2 is full of smart *ss wise cracks and tongue in cheek jokes about the spy thriller genre.All these older movie stars take the mickey out of themselves in ways never seen before.

51,Vartiainen,Excellent sequel,6,23 May 2014,"RED 2 definitely knows how to make a sequel. It keeps doing exactly what made the first film so great, it continues the storyline into a logical direction, the returning actors are just as good and the new ones fit right in.What might make RED 2 even better than its predecessor is the fact that the story is much more interesting. I appreciated the first film for its actors and its humour, but wasn't too enthusiastic about its story, which I felt was just a basic shoot-em-up. RED 2 on the other hand takes full advantage of its action comedy premise and delivers us a good old-fashioned adventure, with Russians, Cold War threats, mad science and nuclear explosives. Classic elements given a humorous spin.The humour and acting are once again topnotch. Obviously they used most of the best old people jokes in the first film, which is why this time the jokes revolve around the characters, which works wonderfully because this time we already know them. The actors are also at the top of their game and Anthony Hopkins is especially well-suited for his role. Though I must say that I do miss Morgan Freeman. A loose action adventure like this one could have handled bringing him back so it's a shame they didn't take advantage of it. Still, a minor issue.Did you like RED? Then you're going to love its sequel. Hopefully they'll make it into a trilogy.",RED 2

As for the latter, Red 2 includes them as well, but thanks to frivolity and making fun of both others and themselves they do not become annoying. The cast is brilliant, includes multiple Oscar winners who seem to enjoy their participation in such a shallow movie for a change; the biggest star here is Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Edward Bailey, a man of many features and logical motives to act as he does. The least interesting to me was Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah Ross.If you like double-crossings, multiple shootings and chases and funny lines topped with great performances, Red 2 is a pleasant entertainment.",RED 2
53,DarkVulcan29,Has fun as the first one.,8,26 July 2013,"I liked the first Red(2010), it was not high art, but a fun entertaining film, an awesome mix of action, comedy, and suspense, and had a bunch of good actors that had good chemistry. Now the sequel really takes the action, comedy, and suspense up a notch. Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker are like a sitcom couple, and they play that very well. John Malkovich is great with his funny deadpan like expression and the lines that go with it. Helen Mirren is good, has the tough middle edge hit woman.Anthony Hopkins brings a good feel to the film, has the wacky scientist who helps them, and Brian Cox returns for the sequel, and when Cox and Hopkins are in a scene together, the thought that went through my mind is, these two guys played Hannibal Lecter.

54,freemantle_uk,A solid sequel,7,7 August 2013,"In 2010 the spy action-comedy RED about a group of retired spies being targeted by the CIA was sleeper hit and was enjoyed by critics and audiences alike. A sequel was commissioned and we got an enjoyable enough continuation, even if critics did not like it.Ex-CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) are living a quiet suburban life, even if Sarah is bored by it. After their friend Marvin (John Malkovich) fakes his own death, Frank ends up incarnated he becomes the target of Jack Horton (Neal McDonough), an American black-ops officer who has Carte Blanche to do anything he wants. Frank and Marvin soon finds out a document about a join British-American operation, Nightshade, a plot to smuggle a nuclear weapon into Moscow has been leaked onto Wikileaks and seen Frank, Marvin and Sarah are forced onto a mission around London, Paris and Moscow. On their tails is Horton, Han Cho-Bai (Byung-hun Lee), the world's best assassin and a Russian agent, Katya (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who easily changes sides.RED 2 is not as good as the original film, but it is enjoyable and does not deserve some of the negative reaction it has received. RED 2 does go through some of the plot points of the first film and this is a sequel that feels it needs to be bigger, using a more international plot. RED 2 continues what works with the first film, Willis being a badass, Mirren doing awesome things with guns and Malkovich being wacky (but at least he is competent). The series also sees two good new additions, Zeta-Jones and Lee, thought Lee was underused.One area of improvement is the villain. A problem with RED was the main villain played by Richard Dreyfuss was basically a very unsubtle Dick Cheney like character. Anthony Hopkins was an upgrade. The stakes were higher, his character was much more eccentric and he had much better motivation. Karl Urban does not return to the series, so McDonough came in his place. Urban had a better character because he was a man simply doing his job, but McDonough does make up for it when he is in full scumbag mode and Lee does offer a physical threat.RED had a very simple premise of an old skool CIA agent being targeted for assassination by his old agency, leading him to show the new guys a lesson. RED 2 expands with many more factions at play, a black ops division of the American Intelligence system, MI6, the Russians and a freelance assassin. At times the film does struggle to give these characters the screen time they deserved, particularly Lee who was underused and it would have been better if he worked closer to the Americans. This is also a film that sees a number of potential international incidents that would throw the world into chaos if any of this stuff really did happen.Like the original RED, RED 2 is a full out and out comedy, and offers more chuckles then full laughs. It is the action where RED 2 wins out, allowing Willis to do what he does best and we get shoot-outs, car chases and fist fights. There is a comic twist to the car chase in Paris as we get two cars chasing the same vehicle in Paris, even having a double reference of For Your Eyes Only and The Bourne Identity. There are also references to Mission Impossible III and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, even the plot of RED 2 has some similarities to MIGP. RED 2 does have solid shoot outs and car chases, but the fist fights are little too over edited.Dean Parisot of Galaxy Quest fame takes over the directing duties from Robert Schwentke. Parisot is a strong replacement, he keeps RED 2 going at a fast pace even with the longer running time and keeps the same look of the first films, whilst being his own moments of flair, such as the use of comic book art.RED 2 is a fun ride of a film and a solid continuation of a good predecessor. It delivers what you want, good action, Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis and offering us a light hearted romp. But I cannot see there being much room for a second sequel.",RED 2

In this one, Bruce and Mary-Louise are a happy couple just trying to lead a normal life but they are lured out of retirement by their old paranoid buddy John. Anthony plays an old bomb maker that has been in prison for 30 years. It seems that someone wants Anthony's secrets concerning a nuclear device and Bruce and his gang are targeted by almost every assassin in the world. Byung-hun plays the best of the best of those contract killers on the hunt for Bruce's head. There are a few cameo stars that show up-you can see some in the trailer. I really enjoyed it and there is a lot of humor that fits in nicely with the action. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.

It is clear by all the huffing and puffing on the part of the wealthy but geriatric cast of this flick (and who's to know how much of this was edited out by modern film editing techniques trickery?) that ordinary people without ""Cadillac"" (or Congressional-level) health care plans would be done in by half the stunts attempted here, sparing the federal government not only decades of health care costs, but also millions in social security payments (which few if any of even the fat-cat Hollywood elite have claimed to decline, since these handouts from Uncle Sam are NOT ""means tested""). Furthermore, if you arm ALL nursing home residents to the level of military knives, guns, and rocket launchers (under their Pre-existing Second Amendment Rights, of course) that are enjoyed by the codgers in RED 2, I can guarantee you that the costs of this armament program will be more than off-set by the savings produced by enhanced mortality rates in the ""DNR"" wings virtually overnight.

57,estebangonzalez10,"Oh silly, silly rabbit, RED2 is for kids!!!",5,6 November 2013,"""If there's one thing I know, it's women and covert operations.""If there's one thing I know, it's that if the first film wasn't good, the sequel probably won't be either. That was the case with RED 2 which follows pretty much the same generic formula that it did in the first RED with the new additions of Catherine Zeta Jones, Anthony Hopkins, and Byung-hun Lee. The film has its funny moments, not thanks to screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber (responsible for the terrible screenplays of Whiteout and Battleship), but to its incredible and highly likable cast. Their presence alone and their interactions together elevate this otherwise ridiculous film. I guess that the producers decided to make a sequel considering the world wide success the first film had (despite not being a fan) and this time they brought Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest and Fun with Dick and Jane) to take over the director's chair that Robert Schwentke (RIPD and Flightplan) had left unoccupied. This sequel takes the same formula and similar situations by mixing comedy with over the top action sequences. There is nothing sophisticated or fresh about this film, so don't go into this expecting an engaging and thoughtful trailer. The plot follows the events from the previous film as Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is trying to enjoy his retired life now with the company of his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), but the relationship is being affected by his overprotective behavior. She is yearning for some action in her life, so when Marvin (John Malkovich) shows up to warn Frank that there are people following them she doesn't hesitate in wanting to come along. But Frank dismisses Marvin and claims he is overreacting and that he and Sarah should continue to go on with their normal lives. It turns out that Marvin was right, as a Pentagon operative named Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) tries to capture Frank and threatens to torture Sarah unless he gives him some important information. Marvin comes to the rescue and explains that they are being hunted due to their previous involvement in a Cold War undercover operation known as Nightshade involving some sort of nuclear weapon. In order to find out more information and discover the reason as to why these men are hunting them down Frank, Sarah, and Marvin travel to Paris and meet up with Russian agent Katya (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who also happens to share a past relationship with Frank. Former MI6 agent, Victoria (Helen Mirren), is hired to kill Frank as well, but being a friend of theirs she gives them the heads up. It seems these former agents have been forced to come out of retirement once again to settle things once and for all.If you thought the first film was silly, then you will think RED 2 is even more ridiculous considering the over the top action scenes involving car chases and gunshots. The plot is really dumb and light, and the only fun you might get out of this film comes from the cast. I actually liked Anthony Hopkins and Byung-hun Lee in their particular roles here, but they just couldn't do much with the material. Hellen Mirren is such a talented actress that at moments it felt embarrassing to hear her speak out her recycled lines. The cast did seem to have a lot of fun with the lightness of it all and John Malkovich delivers several funny lines, but I just felt this film was dull, stale, and unsatisfying. To be honest I came into this film remembering very little about the first film, and I can imagine I will completely forget about this sequel as well in a few more weeks because it is beyond silly. Silly can be good at times, but here I think they went a little too far with it. I will give this two and a half stars for the cast involved because they are just fun to watch at times.",RED 2

All our operatives know is that the operation behind this bomb is simply known as 'Project Nightshade' and our team find themselves travelling to Paris, Moscow & London to try to discover more about 'Project Nightshade' and also to determine who has masterminded this project. To make matters worse for the RED team, they find out that they are being pursued by Han Cho Bai (Byung-Hun Lee) who is an ace contract killer who is being paid by the Americans to kill Moses and the RED team also have the Russian Counter Intelligence lead by Katja (Zeta Jones) who are also very keen to get their hands on this nuclear device.I'll be the first to admit that I absolutely loved the first RED film and having only watched that film about 12 months ago I knew after watching it that a sequel was already being worked on. Naturally, I was eager to see it and I must admit that it was good, but like many sequels it does suffer the typical fate of 'not being as good as the original'.What's interesting about this film is that whilst there are funny moments in the film, the majority of the funny scenes didn't stem from the one person who I expected them to stem from (namely John Malkovich). He was the funny one and the 'scene stealer' in the first film, but I found the majority of the laughs came from Moses' girlfriend Sarah (Mary Louise Parker). Marvin decided to include her in the mission (much to Moses' annoyance) and the team found that more often than not she became a hindrance rather than a help - this is due to the fact that she is the only member of the team that is a 'civilian'. Although her ineptness does cause the team problems, she also proves useful at times as well. This actually made her a much more useful asset than the team imagined. I'm not disappointed that Malkovich wasn't the 'show stopper' but more surprised. I believe that they gave Parker a larger and more humorous role to develop her character more and give her more to do so again this isn't a criticism, it's just it took me a little by surprise. Malkovich is still funny, but not quite as much as he was in the first film.Then we come to the acting; Willis and Malkovich were both great as were Mirren and Parker. However, for me, the stand out performance was Anthony Hopkins. The guy is just in a different league to everyone else involved in this film. Even though he only features in the second half of the film, I found that it was his performance that made the most impact.What let this film down slightly is that there weren't as many laughs as there were in the first film. I remember laughing regularly when watching the first film as opposed to laughing now and again in this sequel. The story is predictable for the most part, although it was still reasonably engaging. It's not as good as the first film, but it still has enough funny moments and action to keep fans of the first film, and of the genre as a whole happy. The anime cut scenes were a nice touch, but I'm not sure what the point of these scenes were? Final thoughts; good film with enough laughter and action to make it a watchable film.

That's a good thing in this case as we rejoin ex assassin Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his merry band of morons for another set of high caliber swashbuckling, this one even sillier than their first picnic. The key is in the deadpan humour, which is served up with all the relish needed to make something so fluffy work. Most of the eclectic cast is back for second helpings, and the ones who caught bullets are replaced by even more bankable names and familiar faces here. Moses, his girlfriend (Mary Louise Parker, finally acquiring her sea legs when it comes to warming up to the carnage) and loony old friend Marvin (John Malkovich) find themselves thrown headlong into an arms race to find a deadly super weapon before it's either detonated or acquired by very dangerous people. Leading them along is a frazzled ex MI6 spook and mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins in silly mode) who has seriously lost his marbles. On their tail is scary CIA psychopath Jack Horton (Neal McDonough nails yet another heinous villain role) who brandishes his silenced pistol with the same verve he uses to flash that icy grin, the last thing you see before the shooting starts. Helen Mirren returns, as does her beau, played again by Brian Cox and his teddy bear worthy Russian accent. Other newcomers include Korean superstar Byung-Hun Lee as an agile and ticked off assassin out to get Moses, Catherine Zeta Jones as a foxy Russian femme fatale and Professor Lupin himself David Thewlis as a snooty arms dealer called The Frog, but not for te reasons you might think. When actors of such skill and notoriety show up in these, it really makes everything else worth it, even if the plot is somewhat up in the clouds, and the mad dash, rat race tone can get a bit too loopy. These pros always keep it grounded when they need to, both with shooting and acting prowess. This one can't quite keep up with how much fun it's predecessor was, but it's certainly more than adequate, especially to see Hopkins, a man of trademark gravitas, give an out of left field (and his mind, really) turn worthy of Jim Carrey and not without a few disarming third act surprises.",RED 2
61,3xHCCH,"""Abso-bloody-lutely"" Great Summer Blockbuster",8,5 August 2013,"I have not seen the first RED which was a big hit back in 2010. So I am watching this film totally unfamiliar with what it was all about. Even then I thoroughly enjoyed the explosive mix of action and humor that made this film click.Frank Moses (a retired CIA operative) is trying to live a quiet life with his mousy girlfriend Sarah (Mary Louise Parker), but you know that is not going to happen to a guy who is certified RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous). A Wiki-leaks cable would implicate Frank and his kooky partner Marvin (John Malkovich) in a Cold War project called Nightshade, developed by genius scientist Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins). This project involved a portable nuclear explosive, which now Frank had to recover. While going all around Moscow, Paris, and London to seek out this weapon of mass destruction , Frank also had to avoid two contracts out to kill him, one by MI6 spy Victoria (Helen Mirren) and another by the vicious Korean hired killer Han (Byung Hun Lee). Frank also encounters an ex- lover Russian spy Katja (Catherine Zeta Jones), who had always been his ""kryptonite"".What we get is a very entertaining, high-octane action film. There was frenzied gunfire, exciting car chases, conniving, double crossing, everything a good spy movie should have. Helen Mirren was so elegant with those firearms. The incredible graceful martial arts skills of Byung-hun Lee was a definite highlight for me.The sense of humor is insane, especially that of John Malkovich. Everybody plays it tongue-in-cheek through all the violent scenes, including typically serious actors like Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins. Mary Louise Parker steals her scenes with her delightful naivety in the light of all the danger around her. Above all, Bruce Willis really takes command of this film as Frank Moses. After a disastrous turn in the critically-massacred ""A Good Day to Die Hard"", this Bruce Willis in ""RED 2"" is the Bruce Willis we all expect and admire. It does not hurt that he has excellent chemistry with the crazy John Malkovich and his ""GI Joe"" co-star Byung-hun Lee.The movie does not take itself too seriously and neither should we. We are there to enjoy the awesomely conceptualized and executed action sequences, as impossible or superhuman as they may look. At the same time, we will also enjoy the lightning-fast zingers and humorous banter among these accomplished actors. Director Dean Parisot definitely achieves what he set out to do--an entertaining summer blockbuster film. 8/10.",RED 2
62,TdSmth5,Bigger isn't better,6,4 January 2014,"Red 1 wasn't all that great and there was no need for a sequel, but as interminable franchises are back in fashion I guess we'll be seeing a bunch of these.Red 2 returns with the cast from Red 1 (fortunately without Freeman) and a bunch of new characters- Anthony Hopkins, Zeta Jones, and a Cobra guy from GI Joe.Willis and Parker witness the death of Malkovich but at the funeral Willis is taken in by the CIA. During interrogation a shady guy who works for another shady guy in a suit at the Pentagon, kills all the agents to get to Frank. Frank escapes with the help of Malkovich and finds out all intelligence agencies and freelance killers in the world are after him for his involved in a project called Nighshade which was about blowing up Moscow during the cold war with a powerful weapon made with red mercury. So the gang figures they're going to go after this weapon for some reason. That takes them to Paris, where they run into a Russian flame of Willis (Zeta Jones) and they learn about the guy (Hopkins) who made the bomb. He's in London so they go and break him out of a secure insane asylum and with him go to Moscow to get the weapon. But he's got some plans of his own and goes to the Iranian embassy for some reason and everyone else after him. Invariably the bomb's timer will start and they'll have to figure out how to stop it in time.Red 2 is bigger in every aspect, longer, more convoluted, globe-spanning, more well-known actors, more unrealistic, sillier. We get a lot more, too many more, shots of Parker's mocking grin, Malkovich's confused look. And all of it is too much and pointless. They tried to make a big deal of the relationship between Parker and Willis and everyone out there is giving these two advice, except that, who cares? There is less violence though, I guess to placate the critics. Bodies pile up but there's no brutality as in part 1. The likable and familiar cast almost manage to make it work. At least they make it somewhat enjoyable.Movies like these have potential, but if this series keeps getting bigger and crazier it's going to end up being even more ridiculous.

64,AudioFileZ,Didn't See That One Coming...,8,1 December 2013,"We all know sequels are, statistically, doomed. Not Red 2! Already having the luxury of knowing all belief should be suspended at the door a viewer can simply be entertained exceptionally well here, sequel and all. Reprising his role as Frank the retired Company man, Willis is in his sweet spot of big action as carried out by a likable everyman. Wisely the producers were able to get the original cast back with an excellent additions of Sir Anthony Hopkins playing an eccentric genius nuclear scientist and Byung-hun Lee as a one man army contract killer. One has to say that casting doesn't get any better than this.It's impossible to give too much credit to John Malkovich as Marvin or Helen Mirren as Victoria as anyone who saw the first movie knows they made it easy for Bruce Willis' Frank character. The addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones is superb as Mary Louis Parker's character, Sarah, bounces off the Jones' character of Katja so brilliantly. Yes, Ms. Parker's role has been elevated exponentially here and that too serves the story well as Frank's peaceful life with her is threatened and she relishes the danger.Red 2 is absolutely as good as the original. Is it better? Perhaps, but definitely as good which is reason for celebration. As a suspension of belief action movie Red 2 works from the beginning. It is tightly paced without a false step and loads of sarcastic dialog and continuous action. Great shootouts and nice car chases filmed expertly in Paris and Moscow. Pure entertainment here no matter how far-fetched the story may be. If you thought Red was a fluke that couldn't be matched...well, you didn't see this one coming!",RED 2

67,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An adequate sequel with minor diminishing returns,6,10 November 2020,"The inevitable curse of sequels coming with a diminishing return is more or less expected by familiar moviegoers. For some reason, capturing lightning in a bottle can be as hard as it physically sounds. The original RED (2010) was a unique action comedy that was very much a lighter toned version of Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables (2010). A dangerous mission involving lethally trained old people who still pack a punch. Based on an obscure DC Comic of the same name, the film managed to be successful either way thanks to its leads and execution of the story. While three years is about average for sequel output, it is no surprise that RED 2 (2013) doesn't meet its original in the same way. However, considering the changes in crewmembers, the decline was not profound.Continuing roughly where the last film ended, Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) are now together trying to live a normal life as intended. Until they are visited once again by their past, this time being Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich). It is there they are pursued by Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) looking to lock them down over a missing nuclear device. Apparently, the device was reported during an earlier time in Frank's career trying to protect a physicist named Dr. Bailey (Anthony Hopkins). Written again by Jon and Erich Hoeber, the screenplay is probably why the experience of watching this sequel doesn't feel like such a misfire; since they worked on the first entry. Directing this time though was Dean Parisot, known for his work on Galaxy Quest (1999), Fun with Dick and Jane (2005) and most recently after this film Bill & Ted Face the Music (2020).For what it's worth, the overall execution is fine. Willis, Malkovich, and Parker as the main three still work well off each other. What feels to be one of the drawbacks to this entry, is the relationship between Frank and Sarah. Even for the first film, old man Moses paired up with Ms. Ross just seemed like a mismatch in age. Here, Sarah continues to try and connect with her ex-CIA partner, which comes with very common tropes seen in other rom-com sub-genre movies. When traveling the world, it is revealed that Frank was swooned over by another field agent by the name of Major General Katja Petrokovich (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Want to guess where that subplot goes? Another problem with the story is that more characters were thrown in as well. There's also appearances from David Thewlis, Byung-hun Lee, as well as returns from Brian Cox and Helen Mirren. It just feels very cramped.And with the amount of characters put into play, there's one scene that seems be edited in the wrong order. This actually messes with the execution when realized and it's unfortunate. Instead of one character chasing the protagonists like in the first film, now there's almost three times as many. It's unfortunate when Neal McDonough is pretty much a copy of Karl Urban's character in the first film. Aside from this though, the actors still play off each other well. Some of the comedic lines are delivered adequately, while other times it falls flat. This is mainly due to the relationship plotline. Anything outside of that thread though tends to work better. The action still entertains though, featuring similar things that have been shown before such as gunfights, explosions and other goofy antics. There's a scene with a helicopter that's pretty hilarious.As for visuals, this time camerawork was shot by Enrique Chediak. Sadly, this crewmember has well-known credits to this name like 28 Weeks Later (2007), 127 Hours (2010), Intruders (2011), The Maze Runner (2014), Deepwater Horizon (2016), Bumblebee (2018) and the Lady and the Tramp (2019) remake, but this sequel is not really one of them. Not to say it's shot badly,...by no means. But it's just nothing out of the ordinary, just like the first film's cinematography. Music though was an acceptable element to this sequel. Again, this also had a change in hands. Instead of Christophe Beck's clicky synthetic percussion based score from the first film, comes Alan Silvestri doing his best to mimic that style. While the sound is more organic using more classic orchestra, there are still jazzy motifs viewers will hear that keeps to the tone of the first movie. Not bad considering Silvestri isn't really cut from the same cloth as Beck.For a sequel, it's okay. It's not an average follow up since the actors still have the chemistry, the music still fits the tone and action comedy elements still entertain; to an extent. Like the first film though, camerawork is still nothing to talk about, the romcom elements feel too familiar and the amount of characters packs the story more than necessary.",RED 2
68,p-stepien,"Expectations met, story ignored",7,24 November 2013,"Still in retirement Frank (Bruce Willis) tries to live as boring a life as possible with his young jubilant fiancée Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). Nonetheless the past never sleeps, the prior special op career as a highly trained assassin for the C.I.A. coming back with a vengeance. Paranoid associate Marvin (John Malkovich) tries to warn them of the imminent threat of blow-back, staging his own death to avoid capture by blowing his SUV on a supermarket parking lot. Soon after a wikileaks cable emerges, which reveals a dark secret of Project Nightshade, a supposed attempt to plant a nuclear bomb in Moscow by the CIA working in cohorts with the crazed genius Dr Bailey (Anthony Hopkins). Soon the CIA, MI6, KGB and a host of hired guns - including super-assassin Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee) and vixen Russian agent Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) - are out to get Frank, an unknowing participant of the project. Their only other aide is legendary British killer Victoria (Helen Mirren).A roller-coaster ride, that sidesteps a complex thought-out plotting, instead just throwing us into a ludicrous scenario, which serves a higher purpose: delivering uninhibited fun through the joyride vessel of witty banter and over-the-top characters focused around the immaculate trio of Willis, Mirren and Malkovich. Add to this a delightfully dark Hopkins, a voluptuous Zeta-Jones and a restrained Lee, the mix of gifted crazies bring in the chaos. All actors seem to be having immense fun doing the movie, taking a break from seriousness, immersing into their guises and seeing where it takes them. This is despite the ridiculous underpinnings of an intrigue that lacks in coherence, but makes up for that by creating wacky settings for the characters to play off of. All in all, the cast seemingly incessantly winking at the audience, continuously suggesting that they sit back and enjoy, don't over-analyse, just let it flow and accept the ride, much like people did back in the days with similarly idiotic setups in ""Spies Like Us"". More a comedy, than an action feature, it does however carry quite the spectacle with well-conceived car cases and Byung-hun Lee's fighting chops delivering an adrenaline rush all the same.Yes, it's incredulous and logically strained beyond the wackiest conspiracy theories, but who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren doing an impersonation of Helen Mirren playing Queen Elisabeth?",RED 2

What else would capture your attention?You will see two usual things in here: shootings, explosions, wild car chases that may incorporate a lot of CGI. And, the other usual things are: the stars themselves. So if you are a star-watcher and like to see things blown up, this is for you. There really aren't other reasons to watch this. OK, unless you are a relative or friend of the stars, and then: maybe. All in all, the movie is well made and that should go for something, but it doesn't. It comes down as disappointing, boring, nothing new. The actors sleep-walk thru this, their dialogues are lame and all in low-key as almost-whispering seems to be the new oratory. The only breath of fresh air is Byung-han Lee as Han Cho Bai a Master Assassin. His moves were worth watching and kind of reminded us of Bruce Lee. Very good. The other stunts, and car chases are the only things that worked. One would think that the casting of Anthony Hopkins (as Dr. Baily, a mad scientist) would elevate things. Sorry, didn't happen. Queen Elizabeth did okay (Bob, that wasn't Queen Elizabeth, it was Helen Mirren). But I saw her wear her crown in here. (Still not her).If you saw the original RED, you have seen everything.

71,moviexclusive,"Returning to the formula of witty banter and over-the-top action, this reunion of aging spies back in action is still plenty of escapist fun",7,30 July 2013,"Defying conventional Hollywood logic, 'Red' (or short for 'Retired: Extremely Dangerous') cast a bunch of actors all above the age of 50 as aging spies forced back into action when their lives are threatened by the very agencies they used to serve. And yet, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren turned the 2010 risky high- concept movie into a sleeper hit, thanks to a firm tongue-in-cheek sensibility that emphasised the actors' ages as much as it did the action.And along with Mary-Louise Parker as Willis' earlier squeeze and Brian Cox as Mirren's former love, Willis, Malkovich and Mirren are back for yet another geezers-with-guns action adventure. Even better, the cast list includes the likes of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Anthony Hopkins, the former playing a Russian double agent who used to have the hots for Willis and the latter a daffy Cold War-era nuclear scientist that may or may not have the answers to their latest embroilment into international espionage.'Red 2' is one of those sequels which rewards fans of the original, especially since returning scriptwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber pick up with Frank Moses (Willis) and Sarah (Parker) having settled down into a quiet and routine coupled life. But as 'Red' amply demonstrated, the former telephone operator craves for a life of excitement more than the CIA retiree, and so when Frank's paranoid former partner Marvin Boggs (Malkovich) turns up with yet another conspiracy theory about a Cold War weapons project named Nightshade that just got hot, Sarah jumps at the chance at getting back into action with Frank.Though initially reluctant, Frank is once again back to doing what he does best when a murderous Pentagon special agent named Jack Horton (Neal McDonough in yet another icy arrogant villainous role) threatens his and Sarah's life. A surprisingly twisty plot ensues around the madcap vignettes that make up the rest of the movie, with Frank's former MI^ British counterpart Victoria (Mirren) sent to take Frank and Marvin out and ruthless South Korean contract killer Han (Lee Byung-Hun) recruited by Jack for exactly the same task.To the Hoebers' credit, at no point does the busy plot ever come off throwaway, despite of course being the narrative glue for the various globe-trotting setpieces that see our heroes go from Paris to London to Moscow. Every city introduces a new piece of the puzzle, which ultimately proves cleverer than one expects it to be. Ditto for the bevy of characters, each of them with their own distinct quirks to add flavour to the entire package. Yes, though it's inevitable that some get more screen time than others, every role seems specifically tailored to the actor's strengths - whether Zeta-Jones' sultry old flame Katja or David Thewlis' information dealer 'The Frog' or Hopkins' shifty scientist Edward Bailey with a questionable case of amnesia.Certainly, the ensemble cast contribute in no small measure to the roster of sprightly characters. Each and every one seem to relish not only the opportunity to work together, but also the chance to play against age and type. Willis keeps his cheeky wink-wink grin throughout, perhaps even more so now that he gets to romance not one but two beautiful ladies at the same time. Malkovich and Parker get some particularly hilarious scenes together, in particular one in which the former is seen alternately exasperated and terrified at the latter's sheer aggressive driving skills trying to outchase Zeta-Jones at capturing 'The Frog' down the streets of Paris. Mirren is once again a standout, absolutely regal portraying a woman with class and steeliness; while Hopkins is perfect as the inscrutably bumbling scientist with more up his sleeve. It's any director's dream come true to have such an impeccable cast, even more so when everyone knows exactly what the material expects of him or her.In that coveted position is Dean Parisot, who takes over from Robert Schwentke by retaining much of the former film's mix of wry humour and over-the-top action. Obviously benefiting from a larger budget no doubt because of the success of its predecessor, Parisot amplifies the action to more ludicrous heights, with plenty of shootouts, car chases, bomb explosions and Mirren shooting pistols in two directions simultaneously from inside a spinning car. This is the kind of overblown action that characterised the high-octane baby-boomer action comedies of the 80s and 90s, and we suspect that the older audience that this is skewed towards will indeed be having a blast.But really, with such a game cast of veterans, it's hard to resist throwing all caution and credibility out the window to simply revel in the kind of cartoonish live-action Hollywood was built and marketed on. Even though what was fresh the first time round feels a bit more familiar now, there is still much fun to be had in the banter and bullets. If summer popcorn fare is built on escapism, then the reunion of 'Really Entertaining Dudes' is just that sort of entertainment.",RED 2
72,quincytheodore,"Bigger, bolder but not better.",6,22 August 2013,"Although not as well constructed as the prequel, these senior action heroes still have gleeful somewhat appealing spy adventure. Like all the movies with collection of stars, RED 2 adds some familiar faces into the mix. Anthony Hopkins and Lee Byung-Hun are nice inclusion, they bring some novelty with nice acting and stunts. The story is far from impeccable, it's a bit rushed, contains too many half-baked plan of infiltration and relies more on firepower than the previous title. However, it is still decent and fun to watch as the cast seem to enjoy the mash, especially towards the end.Story revolves around the usual conspiracy, framed heroes and zealous contract killers. It passes some points with little explanations, these scenes occasionally turn silly, not in the witty parody of spy flick, but simply ridiculously mindless. Bruce Willis has decent performance, although sometimes he looks overly joking, or just sleepy, and can't be taken seriously. John Malkovich is good, he provides strange nuance as if he's funny with that little grim side tucked away. These two and Mary Louise-Parker seem to be enjoying their roles and it gives the movie a lighter tone, almost comedic even.Anthony Hopkins is suavely convincing, his voice exudes sophistication although he appears slightly frail from his age. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the femme fatale from the past, but she's trapped in a generic role and her rivalry with jealous main character is very silly. The martial artist Lee Byung-Hun completes the cast as it's almost mandatory to have an Asian to do all the fight stunts. Surprisingly, he has fairly amount of humor part as well, it won't be a surprise to see him more often in Hollywood movies.While the cast does possess weighty names, the script is rather weak. Jokes are stale, with only a few of them able to force chuckle. Screenplay also isn't executed neatly as in the first, half of it is predictably sluggish. It picks up the pace towards the end and ultimately ends up passable. More explosives and bullets are utilized, although they are dull and have less impact than they are meant to be. Aside from the occasion tussle and despite the soundtracks' fervent attempt to fire up the audience, the action is only average.RED 2 has some merits, it's fairly enjoyable, but it's arguably inferior to the first. It is less charming, not as clever and not an appealing case for another sequel, which is a shame since RED has potential to be a smarter version of Expendables.",RED 2

75,Troy_Campbell,Unsurprisingly ordinary.,4,30 August 2013,"The sequel that nobody was asking for, it goes without saying that Red 2 is not a trailblazer in the field of follow-ups, yet it is useful in confirming a few things. Firstly, Helen Mirren is always good, regardless of the film's quality. Secondly, the original's surprise success was exactly that: a surprise. And finally, that I absolutely, unequivocally, categorically loathe Mary-Louise Parker as an actress. Her monotonous ""shocked"" expression is as ridiculously overstated and unvaried as Zoolander's Blue Steel, but without the intended irony, and the less said about her horrendously annoying voice the better. That aside, Red 2 isn't as horrible as my opening may lead you to believe. There are sporadic fits of decent humour and invigorating action - none of which come from main man Bruce Willis or the over-the-top series-newbie Anthony Hopkins - with Brian Cox and John Malkovich good for the odd giggle whilst the super cool Byung-hun Lee elevates the numerous fight scenes with his intensity and slickness. In one of this year's stranger pairings, Lee and Mirren offer up one memorable moment of complete badass-ness during a car chase, but alas, nothing can stop the ludicrous plotting, dire acting (by some) and subpar dialogue taking its toll. If you weren't a fan of the first Red then you'll positively despise this, if you quite enjoyed the original then you still probably won't like this.",RED 2

If the goal was to top the first one in terms of ridiculous and cartoon-y action, then bravo they succeeded. However, this also feels like a hollow attempt at outdoing what worked so well about the first one. Whereas the first one was understated and spent some time developing the characters (to a degree), this throws a lot of that out of the window and goes for a full-on explosion and shoot-out fest.

I think the problem here is firstly this genre is so so so so so so utterly and completely flooded with so many films that are all the same with the same action sequences, its just dull. There is absolutely nothing exciting about watching these aged actors pretending to be action heroes, under layers and layers of makeup attempting to make them look young and fit whilst the whole time its simply watching stunt doubles. I mean really, what's the point? half the film isn't the actual cast!. Willis clearly doesn't care anymore, the guy is done, past it and doesn't care about acting, he should retire. Louise-Parker is the most annoying female I've come across since Sandra Bullock, she merely smirks, grins and acts coy the entire time, that's all she and Willis do! perform awkwardly as a couple together, its dreadful. Watching Mirren is literately like watching my gran (God rest her soul) in an action flick! its embarrassing. The only person to have more makeup on than Mirren was Zeta-Jones who looked like a frankfurter, how much makeup Jones?? it doesn't make you any sexier or a better actress, give it up. Only good old Malkovich still manages to shine with his bumbling trigger happy persona and Hopkins isn't too bad as the under assuming scientist type with a secret. But wait! the powers that be have really gone to town this time and have tried to hire every aged/aging British thesp they can get their hands on. Enter Thewlis as some other secret agent bloke who is a dab hand with a gun...unsurprisingly. Cox is also back again as Mirren's Russian love interest but does nothing accept sniff her boots.After all that we have Lee Byung-Hun who really sticks out like a sore thumb. A primed firm fit buff martial artist who can take down hordes of men single handed yet can't defeat old man Willis. Surely this dude could and should kill the whole team without breaking sweat, its like he should be in a totally different movie.Nothing of much interest happens for the whole film in all honesty, a few fights, a few shootouts, a dash of lame comedy, Willis and Parker displaying some of the worst acting you've ever seen etc...Its only at the end do we see some fast n furious action...errr in the form of a 'Fast n Furious' styled car chase sequence...in a Lotus that came outta nowhere. The action is hyper yet dumb, so very dumb. I love the standard modern action movie clichés of bad guys spraying these fancy cars with machine gun fire yet no damage is visible, plus no one ever thinks to shoot out the tyres. The less said about the hideous helicopter crash that Willis and co walk away from the better, oh so they are invincible super agents after all.A complete and utter rehash of the first film which somehow manages to be less exciting, not as funny and with tired performance from Willis. First film was quite quirky and fun seeing these old boys kick ass, now its just deflated and repetitive. There just doesn't seem to be any point to this films existence other than simply to try and make more money, just crank out another, no thought, no worries, roll out more of the same, no one will notice or care...its got Bruce Willis in it.3/10",RED 2
80,ivo-cobra8,An excellent action packed fun movie!,9,1 December 2015,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an action packed comedy sequels filled with humor than ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Red 2 (2013) in my opinion is a good movie as the first one, but I still prefer the first movie better than this. The first time I saw it, I thought it was okay. But than again watching both movies separately on Blu-ray I realized I love the first one much better than this one. I like this movie not love just like. But the things that bothered me was this movie was time by time boring unlike the first one. I just got really tired and bored watching it for 2.hrs. You have now a new additions on the cast Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Byung Hun Lee & Neal McDonough and director Robert Schwentke was replaced by new director Dean Parisot. Karl Urban was replaced by Byung Hun Lee who played Storm Shadow in both G.I. Joe flicks. I was little upset that Karl Urban was replaced and he wasn't in this movie. Still I think Byung Hun Lee did an excellent job in this movie. Everyone in this movie does a great job.John Malkovich did an outstanding job playing repressing his role back again as Marvin Boggs and the were full of laughs in it. The story was great and the action was good. I still love the new characters in this, Anthony Hopkins as two face person did a convincing job and believable acting, I seriously love the twist on the end of the movie. Anthony Hopkins Is amazing in this film, the role is perfect and the accent just makes it so awesome, the most bad ass villain ever. The humor in this movie is good, the face off between good and evil is good. The story works and you keep guessing what will be next. Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah Ross is even more hotter than she was in the first movie and a little more sexy than ever. She is gorgeous and does a lot of spy stuff in here, she is like Lucy she wants to do everything in this movie. The movie is really funny and entertaining. I know a lot of people prefer this one over the first one, even my friend told me this one is better. I will still stay by my own opinion and I will always enjoy Red more than Red 2 sorry fans. It is an entertaining movie, Catherine Zeta Jones character was flat, but it served the B story. Mirren-Cox couple was down right cute, John Malkovich was hilarious again, Mary-Louise Parker great, learning the spy trade was slap stick funny, Byung-hun Lee did a good job at being the serious funny and Anthony Hopkins is always good. the action was believable good, the spy stuff was believable good and the chemistry worked.In RED 2, the high-octane action-comedy sequel to the worldwide sleeper hit, retired black-ops CIA agent Frank Moses reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. To succeed, they' will need to survive an army of relentless assassins, ruthless terrorists and power-crazed government officials, all eager to get their hands on the next-generation weapon. The mission takes Frank and his motley crew to Paris, London and Moscow. Outgunned and outmanned, they have only their cunning wits, their old-school skills, and each other to rely on as they try to save the world—and stay alive in the process. It is still good movie not the best or that great but still good full action packed enjoyable flick to watch! Overall: It is a good action packed fun excellent movie with the twists around, great action scenes, great cast and just great acting. The Acting in this movie is very realistic and outstanding performed from all the actors in here. I like how different these action movies are , they are cheesy but also have some brains to the plot and the characters , Bruce Willis being one of my favorites , I always liked the concept of old veteran people still teaching the young bunch how its done. Red 2 is as good as the first one with it's original cast returning again and kicking ass all over the place, just without Morgan Freeman and my favorite all time actor Karl Urban! Red 2 is the same level as Red 1 but still good one it is a good time, it does kind a little drag one, this one does feel a bit longer than the first one but still good. I am giving it a 9 which is A- for me because there wasn't Karl Urban in it. Red 2 is 2013 American action comedy film and sequel to Red (2010).

84,ersinkdotcom,"""Red 2"" is More of the Same Fun Action Hijinks",8,22 November 2013,"""Red 2"" hits Blu-ray and DVD and begs the question, ""Does it live up to its predecessor?"" All of the gang from the original is back for more action hijinks minus Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban. While this sequel doesn't hold the same charm, it still makes for an entertaining diversion from the anxieties of real life as we're taken globe-trotting around the world for a couple of hours.Ex-CIA Black Ops agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) find themselves teaming up with their old friends to find a portable nuclear device that went missing. They soon discover they're in a race against time with other organizations wanting to get their hands on the deadly weapon. The adventures take them around the world in their dangerous search as they try to stay alive amongst the crossfire of friends and foes.The audio and video transfers for ""Red 2"" are wonderful. The movie is presented in 1080p High-Definition (2.40:1). The picture is clean, vibrant, and easy on the eyes. The 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround drops viewers right into the thick of the action with plenty of explosions and gunfire to keep them alert.Some might feel ""Red 2"" is a little light in the special features department. ""The 'Red 2' Experience"" takes audiences behind-the-scenes with an array of featurettes centered on the weapons, cast, and stunts in the movie. A gag reel and deleted scenes are the only other items included.""Red 2"" is rated PG-13 and with good reason. There's a lot of blood and violence as one would expect from an action/spy thrill-ride. Adult language is used as well. In a world of over-the-top R-rated action flicks, ""Red 2"" is really a rather tame good time for the mature members of your family.I couldn't help thinking something was missing from ""Red 2."" It feels like a reunion with characters you came to love in the original. At the same time you still mourn the absence of Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban. Anthony Hopkins does a relatively good job filling their shoes with his charisma as the scientist who created the lost nuclear device. While it's technically more of the same that we got from the first film, ""Red 2"" has enough humor and energy to keep viewers interested.",RED 2
85,skepticskeptical,A Failed Parody of a Parody of a Spoof of a Spy Movie--because it's just not funny,3,13 November 2014,"I had checked out both Red and Red 2 from the library but came very close to not watching Red 2 because Red was so bad. I only ended up mustering up the courage to put the disc in the player on the supposition that Anthony Hopkins would not lend his talent and name to something totally and utterly clichéd to the point of being cartoonesque. In retrospect, with the benefit of hindsight, I recognize that Hopkins, like Malkovitch, Mirren, and Willis, must have been strapped for cash. It probably is tough to land roles once an actor transcends middle age.Red 2 reveals through the use of animated images as dividers of sorts that Red, too, was actually supposed to be a cartoon where real people are used instead of illustrations of them. All of the characters are shallow caricatures with two-dimensional personalities. Unfortunately, the attempts at humor are equally lame. I offer only one example from Red 2: is the sight of Helen Mirren pouring body-dissolving acid onto a man who is still kicking in her bathtub really supposed to be funny???? The issue here is not only one of intelligence (as several reviewers have opined). More importantly there are fundamentals of taste to consider. I for one find most of the ""comic"" scenes of murder in these movies to be highly distasteful. Is there something wrong with me for not agreeing with these sophomoric directors? Did anyone else notice that they are kindred spirits to the Alan Alda character in Woody Allen's Crimes & Misdemeanors who ""philosophizes"" that ""Comedy is tragedy plus time""? I don't think that enough time has elapsed since the CIA (Caustic Incompetence Agency) subjected unwitting persons to massive doses of LSD over lengthy periods of time for this to constitute comedy. To be perfectly frank, no amount of time would suffice. It's just not funny. At all. Good comedy is intelligent. This is not. Red and Red 2 strike me as a symptom of our times. Even POTUS makes jokes about his drone executions. He warned the Jonas brothers to stay away from his daughters or else he'd send out the killer drones: ""you won't see it coming"" or something along those lines. Ha ha. Who is laughing at this stuff? Certainly not the victims. Maybe this is all a result of our SSRI-saturated culture and the concomitant culling of conscience and empathy from once compassionate and sentient beings. None of this bodes well for the future of humanity...",RED 2
86,griffolyon12,Not Worth Your Time,4,9 August 2013,"Every year there's always a parade of seemingly unnecessary sequels, the thing with Red 2 is that I thought that the first Red had a good enough concept with fun enough characters that it would be a blast to revisit them. Boy, was I wrong. Red 2 is just a boring movie that tries too hard. None of the action is real exciting, none of the jokes ever really work, and all of the actors just seem bored here. While Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren are all back as retired secret agents on the run, the film lacks the wit and charm of its predecessor. Not to mention the fact that the plot makes little to no sense, is bloated with too many underdeveloped characters, and therefore I just don't care. Honestly, this is the first movie in a long time that I seriously thought about leaving the theater after about midway through. The only shining light is Anthony Hopkins as a deranged mad scientist, other than that, Red 2 is a complete misfire.I give Red 2 a 4 out of 10!",RED 2
87,Rickting,A lot better than you might think although it doesn't do anything brave,6,9 December 2014,"Red was a very fun action comedy but if you asked whether it needed a sequel few would actually say yes. However, since it was successful a sequel is what we get, but thankfully the damage is little. Expanding the awesome cast of the first, the assassins try to track down a portable nuclear device and plenty of comic action ensues. Although it goes the motions and doesn't come up with an interesting plot Red 2 is far more fun than expected. The selling point of the film is the cast and mostly it delivers on this front. Bruce Willis gives one of the phoned in performances he seems to be becoming known for, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins are excellent and everyone else is entertaining. Aside from Willis, who could just be there for the paycheck, everyone seems to be having a good time and the enjoyment is infectious. Red 2 isn't as good as the original as it goes more into action territory, but it's not a disaster and manages to be one of the better films of an awful summer.Red 2 doesn't do anything memorable or adventurous and follows the action comedy checklist, ticking most of the boxes. It's fairly forgettable as everything in this movie has been done before and it trades goofy fun for bombast up to a point, but it is totally inoffensive and genuinely fun entertainment. The script isn't as funny, but it's still jokey and has a lightness of touch which isn't seen enough these days. The action sequences aren't as over the top as you'd expect, and use the surroundings in an interesting and memorable way. It's a well directed film in general, and provides plenty of goofy thrills. It's nothing special, but given the less than enthusiastic reviews it certainly exceeds expectations. Like most sequels it's inferior, but surprisingly it comes relatively close to the original. Bruce Willis is a bit off putting at times, but overall it's an enjoyable slice of silly action. Even if watching London getting blown up in 2013 movies is getting annoying.6/10",RED 2
88,DareDevilKid,Funny Humor! Cool Action! Sizzling Chemistry! Great Movie!,8,3 August 2013,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.7/5 starsWow, along with ""The Heat', we've had two great action comedies in a single year, after being starved of this rare feast for ages. Now that's really something. ""Red 2"" is as funny as the original & surpasses it in terms of spectacle and scale. What it lacks in its screenplay and narrative, it more than makes up for in its thrilling action scenes, humor, and crackling chemistry between its actors - just like its classic predecessor.Bruce Willis once again proves why he's revered as one of the greatest macho movie-icons of all time - the man puts most younger leading men to shame at his age.

Helen Mirren continues to prove that there isn't a role she can't play and the new comers to the series, like Anthony Hopkins and Byung-hun Lee, are amazing and fun to watch. And Lee's fight scenes are just awesome! Like the last film, the movie is funny and the action is over-the-top and outrageous to watch.

The new character Edward Bailey played by Anthony Hopkins is very funny, but also strange, he fits into this universe very well.It is very much based on the same action packed, weird happenings, big guns and big explosions, and over-all crazy behavior as the first movie, but something is just missing and it doesn't have the same intensity and isn't just a funny.

93,willcundallreview,A poor attempt at a sequel,4,20 December 2015,"Red 2 at first caught me off guard a little; there I was thinking that it wasn't so bad at the beginning and that maybe people dislike this a bit too much, I was wrong. The second movie in the series is one of high octane action of which some could say the quota is pushed up in this one but it fails to make much a decent original plot and wastes the possible decent action-comedy this could have been. I must say for the record that I pretty much didn't like the first film, it was mediocre stuff really and the same for me applies here although this is generally much poorer than the first movie. Yet again starring Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, this time we see the gang of retirees and friends chase down a missing nuclear device of which such a thing could wipe out millions of people. That synopsis I just gave is the whole reason this is disappointing to me, it goes for the most over the top and yet most over used storyline ever.This time the movie throws in Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta- Jones (yes they seem to have been casting in Wales) and both are really kind of not used well but at the same time do at least bring personality. It's not that either does not bring skill to the cast, particularly Hopkins as Dr Bailey who does actually play the role very nicely but both are used to create incredibly basic characters and I wish this plot and its characters could have been more new and fresh. In comes a few people we saw from the first film and they do help the plot a little but overall nothing can be done to stop this being pretty dumb really, even the decent action is edited in an awful way which for me is one of the biggest mistakes of this movie.Dean Parisot was not the right choice for this movie as director; from a film perspective he has made comedies before but his work is not a good effort for this. See getting a director for this kind of movie you would think the reasonable choice would be someone with a good background in comedy and action or possibly both but you get neither here, by no means does Parisot ruin this, but he doesn't do a great deal right. The two Hoeber's who wrote the first film write again and yet again it feels like a script that could look good on paper but comes out poorly on the screen, yet again like with Parisot they don't destroy the film, just make it below-par stuff.Listen I'm not going to tell you to completely not watch this, with the first instalment I felt it was a film that a lot of people could enjoy but with this although I felt it wasn't as good, it still is far from terrible. I have to admit parts of this are not all bad and some bits if you take away what's going on in the story can be exciting, overall though just not a solid enough effort. Oh yes and one other thing that really for me didn't work was not only the bad guys in this, but also the way in which this movie seems to play serious a second after being silly, it just means that when an actual decent bit of serious acting comes in, a very basic joke either precedes or succeeds it and it just doesn't feel right. All in all a comedy-action that never quite even reaches the average heights of it's predecessor, try as it may it still just feels stupid and the cast is wasted on yet another pointless adventure.",RED 2

95,p-jonsson,Great action-comedy! A very entertaining movie.,9,2 January 2014,"As the first movie I watched in 2014 this was a great start to the new year. This is a great action comedy without any real faults. The single stars that some people attribute it is justwell nonsense. These people must have watched this movie by accident since it is very much in the same style as the previous one so the over the top action, slapstick jokes etc. should not really be much of a surprise.Bruce Willis, John Malkoitch and Helen Mirror is back and are doing great. They are just so much fun to watch. I really like Helen Mirror's role. I think Byung-hun Lee as Han Cho Bai is the weakest of the characters. He starts of well in the first scenes where he is introduced but then he becomes a bit silly. The scenes where he fights himself away from the Russian cops, where the cops just wait in line for him to beat them up, is probably the most stupid scene in the movie.There is of course a lot of action and I find it well done. Sure it is over the top and perhaps not very believable but this is an action-comedy after all so if you complain you have missed what type of movie this is supposed to be.Plot-wise? Well the god news is that there is one. It might not be fantastic but it is there, it is not overly stupid and it ties together the movie in a decent way.This is simply a great entertainment movie just the way this kind of movie should be made.

I love it. Like Taken, Jason Bourne, John Wick, Shoot 'Em Up, so called extreme action. Well, called so by me. (I realize there are tons of older action-movies too, but the term extreme action best describes this new wave of action movies) Action often helped by CGI, action that is not meant to be ""realistic"". (a word that should never really be used about movies)Anyhow, Red 2 is a very entertaining action movie about a lot of people who are the best. The action is over-the-top, really cool. Awesome actors, Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Anthony Hopkins. It's really cool to see them kicking ass.So, let me say it as simple as this: if you like action for entertainments sake, you probably wont go wrong with this.I hope we get another one, and that they up the action even more.

97,HelenMary,"funny, good action, but overall a disappointing film tho not one to take seriously",5,4 August 2013,"Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Anthony Hopkins... a stellar cast, doing comedy. Should be awesome. RED the original was brilliant; a new concept and genuinely funny because of that. Malkovich being the plucky nutsy comic relief? Genius. RED2 however was a little tired, it was trying too hard to recreate the original and falling short. Yes it was still funny in places, yes some of the action was great (Byung-hun Lee was superb and his surname Lee is apt - saw some of the genius of Jackie Chan in his moves too), but the characters and plot was a little thin and with these actors, you hold the film to a higher judgement, and the film - though not to be taken seriously was silly rather than funny.I think actually that Lee held the film for me, every scene he was in was better as his brand of action was up a notch. The plot was sketchy and not even remotely believable; yes action has a lot of suspension of disbelief but sometimes there has to be some credible damage. I hadn't realised (or remembered) that RED is a DC Comic film, and this is played out through the film as still comic inserts, which broke up the story a little bit, I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or just a reminder that this story isn't remotely true to life. Perhaps the super-survival of the characters is part of the comedy - they are comic book characters - and the rating on the film is 12a (there were some very little children <10) in my viewing and I considered it wildly inappropriate for them) so people only getting booboos rather than dying (think George of the Jungle) is appropriate perhaps!? The violence however is sustained and throughout the film - there are actually quite a few deaths - with some incredible stunts and car scenes. Nothing that hasn't been done before, but still enjoyable to watch especially the spinning car and someone just stepping into it... always a joy.Catherine Zeta-Jones and Mary-Louise Parker weren't particularly believable or engaging, and I didn't feel much connection to any of the characters. Everyone was adequate, rather than good, as if they weren't really bringing their A-game and had to reserve the energy for more worthy film titles! Anthony Hopkins stood out but whilst he reprised aspects of Hannibal Lector or Van Helsing in his mad genius kind of way, I sensed he too was acting by numbers. You could see the process, see the intent. The Chemistry between Willis and Malkovich was comedic and fun and it was their silliness - Malkovich particularly - that I really got the most laughs out of. Malkovich does comedy well (lets forget Johnny English and HHGTTG) and him as Carmen Miranda is just hilarious.I love silly humour, and this has it in spades, but whilst I realise this isn't a film to take seriously, and is almost a spoof of Bond-esque franchises (in themselves not that serious), I do expect some intelligence and humour that isn't so obviously contrived. Watching the film was almost like hearing the stage direction with the script on your lap. Willis was like he was reading a line, performing a line, he was so staccato. Great film in theory, fabulous concept, enjoyable popcorn film but could have been a LOT better.",RED 2

Yes the plot has king size holes, and some of the solution offered in it are definitely forced, but it doesn't matter, everybody is having so much fun one can't help but join the party. The director Dean Parisot, is showing once again his talent for action and humor combinations, I loved the fade into cartoons at the scenes' ends, they suit the film beautifully.

RED (series?) is based on a good idea and very well realized so far. Can't wait for the next ""set of adventures"". It is not unusual that a sequel serves only for the profit ""take what you can while you can"" purpose, but this is not such a case. It's really fun, as was the previous movie.

103,gregeichelberger,"Not the worst sequel, but nowhere near the best",5,4 August 2013,"Lightning doesn't often strike twice in the same place, and that goes double for film sequels. Those expecting this newest DC Entertainment release, ""Red 2,"" to capture the same feel as its 2010 predecessor, ""Red,"" will be a bit disappointed, although it is safe to write that the sting will not be too great as this installment does have a few good things going for it.The most important factor is the cast, Helen Mirren (""Hitchcock"") as Victoria, John Malkovich (""Warm Bodies"") as Marvin, and Bruce Willis (""A Good Day to Die Hard"") as Frank Ross are back.The trio plays the Retired Extremely Dangerous crew of ex-government black operatives who are being hunted by both good guys and bad often for situations they have no control over. Joining them in the action this time is Mary-Louise Parker (""R.I.P.D."") as Frank's sweetheart Sarah Ross, who seems sweet enough . . .But this is no ordinary over-the-hill gang — this group is extremely lethal (as the piling bodies can attest) and they can most definitely fend for themselves. However, when the blow-back from a 30-plus covert operation (code named ""Nightshade"") hits the fan, they find things very uncomfortable even for them as they whisk from Moscow to Paris to London in search of a dirty nuclear device that can be carried — conveniently enough — in a small suitcase.Especially hot on their tails are evil CIA agent Jack Horton (Neal McDonough, ""Captain America: The First Avenger""), Russian KGB femme fatale Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones, ""Side Effects"") and Korean super assassin Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee, ""Masquerade""), who adds some high-octane martial arts fuel to the proceedings.The addled scientist who came up with the Nightshade concept, Dr. Bailey (Academy Award-winning Anthony Hopkins, ""Thor""), also tags along for the twisting and turning ride.During it all, look for switching loyalties and a plot like ""The Eiger Sanction"" where no one can seemingly be trusted and friendships turn on a dime to unfold. Director Dean Parisot (""Fun with Dick and Jane"") attempts to keep the action at a maximum and the confusion at a minimum. Sometimes he succeeds, other times, well, not so much.Despite ""Red 2"" being a DC production where dark and gloomy seems to be the watchword (see, for example, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and the more recent ""Man of Steel""), the main cast seems to have fun with the premise. Malkovich's character, kind of a dim-bulb weapons expert, gets most of the funnier lines (despite his constant mumblings about Frank and Sarah's relationship), while Mirren's suave and sexy senior gets in a few zingers herself between her many killings and dismemberments.Willis, though, is just Willis, and he barely registers any more of an emotional up-tick than he did in his ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" extended cameo even while playing off the often zany Parker. In the first film, he was forced to include Sarah in the high-stakes secret agent hi-jinx, which solicited most of the humor. Here, however, he plays a sour one-note tune of trying to keep her away from the action, which wears thin very quickly.Ultimately, the film tries to walk a thin line between wide farce, action adventure and real world terrorist suspense and at times has a problem overcoming the schizophrenia such an effort is required to maintain.Still, avid fans of the first installment are likely to find themselves enjoying ""Red 2"" for the most part, while us casual observers will most likely just take it or leave it.",RED 2

Following in the footsteps of ""Red"" Willis and company keep the laughs and action alive in this sequel. Malkocich is timely in his delivery as Marvin the wacked-out nutjob, Mirren is a gracious as ever and beautiful to no bounds as Victoria the MI-6 femme- fatale, Louise Parker delivers a spark of humor and sexiness as a plain Jane to Zeta Jones as the Russian Diva. I found Anthony Hopkins to be brilliant as ever as the witty, charismatic but unrelentless victim/villain. A profound film that just has an ensemble cast that makes the entire film fun to watch.

This sequel has arguably more action than the original, probably at the exchange of plot. The opening fight is great, and a nice call-back to the first film. The street shootout, car chase, convenience store fight, and airport fight are all very well-done, and there are lots of other cool scenes. Both movies have one standout fight scene. The first had Willis vs Urban, and this one has Willis vs Lee, which I enjoyed more. The convenience store fight also really showcased Lee's skills.

109,JPfanatic93,The return of the REDs,7,23 September 2013,"Sequel to Red (2010) (Retired: Extremely Dangerous), based on the graphic novels by Warren Ellis, continues the simple tradition its predecessor so successfully kicked off, delightfully combining well respected grand actors with dynamic action sequences and any number of nifty explosions. Bruce Willis, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren reunite as a band of retired government agents, all still extremely accomplished killers nevertheless. Morgan Freeman has been traded in for Anthony Hopkins and David Thewlis, which is not the worst deal imaginable though Freeman's charming character is still sorely missed (but even in an over-the-top action franchise like this, dead is dead). Living a quiet, everyday life with his new girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), ex-CIA operative Frank Moses (Willis) has no intention of getting mixed up with gunfights and conspiracies again, but such things tend to find him regardless. When his paranoid, mentally unhinged pal Marvin resorts to faking his own death, Moses finds himself sucked into another plot revolving around a portable nuclear bomb hidden in the Kremlin, something he is rumoured to be involved in. As was the case in the previous film, it's necessary for him and his friends to travel around the globe in order to piece together the puzzle, which brings them to exotic (or close to), luxurious locales including Moscow and Paris, a staple of spy films but delivered with ample fervour not to get noticed. Thrown in the mix are Hopkins as an unbalanced inventor of weapons of mass destruction who has spend 20 years in a looney bin, Thewlis as a shady information dealer who much prefers the good things in life (like hideously expensive rare wines) over gunplay and gratuitous violence, Catherine Zeta-Jones as a foxy agent sharing a history with Moses and out to seduce him once more, and, as before, Brian Cox as a former Russian KGB-officer and hopeless romantic who appreciates the sight of his beloved Helen Mirren offing people over all else. As the merry band of aging killers shoots and bombs its way through the plot, Moses must also come to terms with his younger and inexperienced girlfriend, who now considers this sort of bloody adventure a neat holiday trip and bonding experience, and takes as much points as she can in the art of mayhem, much to his chagrin (and a far cry from the not quite so enthusiastic Sarah from the first film). Suffice to say, if you're not a fan of guns and other assorted weaponry, this movie is definitely not recommended to you. However, like the first Red, this successor is nothing but a highly entertaining action flick that appropriates the huge talents of the renowned actors it has brought together to great effect, clearly enabling the ensemble to have a blast itself. Though the movie is otherwise devoid of narrative surprises, the high levels of good fun and a decent number of high paced action scenes make for a decent way to spend your two hours.",RED 2

Red was vastly enjoyable and Red 2, I am happy to report, matches that enjoyment. Everyone in this cast is spectacular. Bruce Willis is one of the best there is in action movies. As Frank Moses assembling his band of quirky and deadly operatives, throw in a portable nuclear device, some twists, turns and unexpected moments, and you've got an action picture guaranteed to please. Helen Mirren is simply splendid – how can one manage to look elegant and be so dangerous? Anthony Hopkins never fails to provide a performance that is stellar and in this one, he goes above and beyond. Byung-hun Lee was amazing. For some odd reason, he reminded me of a Korean version of Brad Pitt. At any rate, he was perfection. Mary-Louise Parker is a funny delight and John Malkovich is a stitch.

112,rcolgan,"""Its important to enjoy life while you still can""",7,6 August 2014,"After RED was such a hit, we were given this sequel that continued the missions of Frank and his team of the Retired and Extremely Dangerous 3 years after the events of the first film. They're a little older, but just as deadly. Whilst it wasn't quite as enjoyable as the first film, it does maintain most of the same charm and humour that made the first so enjoyable. They try to up the ante this time, going up from a small conspiracy to take down retired agents to a nuclear plot that threatens to cause grave peril and gets the REDs turned hunted as terrorists. Overall the story works and just like the first leads to several good twists, many of which were unexpected. Though at times it does feel a little over the top. Particularly towards the end where it seems to descend into the physics similar to the Fast and Furious films. It's still fun to watch. Just a different kind of fun to the rest of the film. What really makes this film work is the chemistry between the actors. And what else is to be expected? The film boosts a great cast ranging from Oscar winners Hopkins and Mirren to other big names like Willis and Malkovich. They all bring a real sense of comradery between one another and embrace the silly nature of the script. Each makes sure that we believe that each of them is a trained agent and make the premise often believable. The returning cast all do a great job at reprising their roles. Malkovich brings the same insanity as he did the first film. He doesn't get any moments as good as ""Old man my ass!"" But he's still probably the films strongest character, largely due to how casually he treats murder and his great delivery of dialogue. Also Miren still thrives in being a bad ass, acting like a female Bond who's constantly in control. It's far different from the usual refined queens she normally plays and it feels like she loves playing the role. On top of this the new cast add their own talents to their respective roles. Hopkins plays an aged scientist who created the bomb. He gets quite a few funny moments through his forgetful nature (drifting off mid-conversation in to random topics) but also a lot of awesome moments where he takes control of a situation too as the film goes on. Then there's Byung-hun Lee, a hired assassin with a grudge against Willis' character who's been paid to take him down (pretty much replacing Karl Urbans character in the first film). He gets some of the best action sequences of the film, displaying some impressive hand to hand combat skills, making a good use of both quick reflexes and his surrounding environment. And just like before, all the action sequences in the film blend very well with the light hearted humour. It's never too gritty or serious and remains a feel good film from start to finish. It's a lot of fun to watch and leaves one wanting another sequel to the franchise.",RED 2

Anthony Hopkins is great; his role as Bailey is almost like Hannibal Lecter on happy pills. Helen Mirren is excellent yet again as the vicious Victoria and Mary-Louise Parker does well again as Sarah. However Bruce Willis does, at points, come across uncomfortably unconvincing; yet he's good in other parts of the film. I am unfortunately losing hope in his ability; we are a million miles away from a certain John McClane. I think John Malkovich is a superb actor, but the dialogue and material he was given didn't match his acting skills.As i said it is basically a better version of Expendables, but instead of a cast full of over the top, cheeseball actors, you have Oscar winners and fully fledged stars.

121,feyipuk,To many spies dilutes the flavour of this potentially spicy film,5,12 March 2014,"Given the level of the first film, this one seemed to be a lot more sitting and flying than car chases and gun fights. Freeman and Urban have gone, Hopkins, Zeta-Jones, Byung-hun Lee and McDonough are in. Adding more characters does result in a dilution of screen time, and a promising start loses steam as the film goes on. Mirren is again the stand out character, dispatching bad guys left and right, while maintaining a regal air. Short of giving her corgi attack dogs would you couldn't get much more of a Lady Penelope, upper class assassin, but her portrayal is so good, she doesn't need such graphic demonstrations. It's just a shame she doesn't get more screen time; reuniting her with Brian Cox's Ivan still smoulders, yet it's a flame that gets lost in everything else going on. Likewise, Mary-Louise Parker gets a bigger role this time out. Less standing around with her mouth open in wonder as the others save the planet, this time she's more than just Willis's girl friend, which makes for a decent dynamic in the group. What lets it down is Malkovich. He doesn't seem as jumpy, and a bit flat. Yes, he still wears unusual hats and crazy disguises, still seems eccentric compared to his colleagues, but he doesn't punch anyone he things is tailing him or carry weapons in unconventional places...or really shoot anyone. Again, he could have done with some more screen time. The first film had Willis and Co vs Urban, this has Willis and Co vs...well, it's complicated, and if anything the real battle is between Parker and Zeta-Jones - playing a Russian Spy (General?) from Franks past - with Parker trying to prove she is equal to this new arrival. If I had to sum up his role, Malkovich gets relegated to door opener.The film is a lot more black comedy that played for straight laughs this time. Hopkins is an excellent actor, but he seems to be mixing the confused genius of Dustin Hoffman's Rainman with the his own brooding Hannibal Lector, and - I'm sounding like a broken record - it would have been good to allow him to develop the character further. As other reviews have said, there seems to be too much time on product placement - Papa Johns, Pringles, Lotus - and this gets nearly as much time on screen as McDonough! The locations are pretty impressive, with some nice touristy shots from around the world. I knew that the scene were Zeta-Jones arrives was filmed in the entrance hall at Central Hall, Westminster, with the Main Hall used as wardrobe and backstage. This kind of sums up this film; I'm sure the stars loved having such large dressing rooms, yet the film lacks the scale it could have. They drink a lot of wine in this film, and I got through two bottles watching it. It's a nice, slow film, that could have had more action or more suspense, but while the actors may have matured with time, this film lost its crispness by the end.",RED 2

I must admit that if I were a different person, I would have long ago become a stalker on a certain southern California beach ... alas ... Mr. Willis ... you are safe! But enough of this foolishness ... lets get down to the movie!This one is even better than the first ... oh, I already said that. Well, it was worth saying twice! Same cast with a few fabulous additions ... such as Hannabal The Cannibal's Anthony Hopkins! Would you believe I actually have a six foot talking statue of him ... I DO! Nice to see sexpot Catherine Zeta-Jones looking her so seductive self in this movie. One has to sympathize with this vixen due to her severe mental and emotional problems which I can so easily identify with. To know us is to love us ... from a safe distance! I'm not really a fan of her's, as she comes across as only being good scenery with no real depth. The total opposite of someone like Marilyn Monroe or even Doris Day. I'm a huge fan of Doris Day ... she's just so dern talented.Hopkins is as evilicious as ever! Unfortunately, every time I see this man I remember that particular sinfullicious scene where he partakes of Ray Liotta's brain at dinner, while the victim is still alive and talking. That has got to be the freakiest scene ever filmed! SICK!I can see why Byung-hun Lee has become such a popular sex symbol in the islands ... what a body, what a face ... he's got all the right moves, and his acting is top-notch as well! Of course, I've always been more into the Pierce Brosnan type ... but that doesn't mean I can look where the lookin' is sooo very good!The stunts and special effects are superb ... especially one scene where our heroes are driving away and you see a car do a flip behind them ... what a cool shot that is ... totally artistic! I love ART ... and that's right up there with Tom Kelley's ""New Wrinkle!"" Though nothing will ever surpass the latter!Mary-Louise Parker was not quite as good in this film as she was in the last, perhaps she became too comfortable with the role? Whatever, I still enjoyed see her in the same role, and she was far better that was Catherine. I think the problem with the latter is that she doesn't have a body to match the face and hair, and her looks seem to be fading with age. Perhaps she should start thinking about getting some parts with some real bite to them?!Anyhoots ... I love RED 2 ... it has its pitfalls, but it is still a top notch action film filled with everything that has made each of its cast members a household name in great entertainment!P.S. Keep up the good work, Bruce! May your next wish be a gift from The Angels! And ... by the way ... I'll bet you $ 100,000.00 that you are a crier!

130,cornflakeboy20,"fun, but typical",5,18 July 2013,"We open with Bruce Willis and Mary Parker shopping at Costco, attempting a domestic existence. Mary is eager for the excitement of their former adventures. They are, of course, soon interrupted by another chance at international intrigue, and multiple assassination attempts. The main plot of the movie involves an attempt to track down a nuclear bomb left in the Kremlin during the Cold War. A shadowy US government conspiracy is of course in effect to cover up this information, and a surprising number of soldiers and bureaucrats are bloodlessly (it's PG13) gunned down by the enemies. Somehow, this element disturbed me and distracted from the comedy. Our international assassins are of course all cartoonishly portrayed; a new Asian assassin even manages to take down a man with an origami crane. John Malkovitch and, later, Anthony Hopkins practically satirize themselves, phoning in their performances. It seems to have become a thing in movies lately to open a door somewhere and reveal some liver spotted Oscar winner doing an impression of himself. The chases and action sequences range from fun and exciting to ridiculous, such as the scene where Helen Mirren fires two guns in slow motion from the windows of a turning car, which has been featured in the advertising; it seems stolen from Wanted, and is stupid in either movie. This movie is not bad and a good entertaining time killer, but I wouldn't recommend theater pricing on it.",RED 2

133,miroslavhradel,Uninspired and pretty tiresome to watch,3,8 June 2020,"I was pretty disappointed to find out that the first RED movie was nothing more than an average action comedy. Accordingly, I was reluctant to give the sequel a try for quite some time, even though I eventually decided to do so after coming to the point of naively hoping that it might turn out to be a good movie.Of course, it did not. It was abundant in old-fashioned and vapid jokes that would occasionally turn out to be blatantly sexist and prejudicial. Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, who were already disappointing in the first installment, appeared to have slightly more prominence in the sequel, with the latter once again being incredibly annoying as a childishly foolish and bland character. Even John Malkovich, who was the main source of entertainment in the first movie, turned out to be almost completely uninteresting in this one.The only refreshing character of RED 2 was Bailey, played by Anthony Hopkins. He was more or less the film's only source of entertainment and the way he switched sides made for a relatively good plot twist, even though that was at the same time pretty much the only memorable feature of a story that was just as uninspired as the one in the previous installment. Needless to say, the two contract killers who had been given the task of eliminating Bruce Willis' character eventually teamed up with him in order to bring down Bailey.It equally goes without saying that such a poor story was completely overshadowed by spectacular stunts. The movie features numerous shootouts and a couple of lengthy car chases, which turn out to be very professionally made when it comes to their visual appearance, but are at the same time excessively cartoonish and happen to be pretty boring to watch. Another thing that I liked about the film's visual appearance was the inclusion of comic book elements between sequences.",RED 2

So what makes Red 2 any different? Well for one, it's actually enjoyable and its characters have *gasp* character. I watched this movie after sitting through the Red Dawn remake and the latest Die Hard, the most boring of action flicks. Needless to say, Red 2 was a welcome improvement.I actually think it has some merits over the original. It brings in Catherine Zeta Jones (swoons), Anthony Hopkins, and Byung-Hun Lee, three actors I quite like who shine brightly in this film. The humor is all well done and funny. There isn't a lot of action, which again is actually really nice. We actually get scenes devoted to the characters and plot because of this. There are action scenes though and let me tell you, they are awesome. I can't expect this to impress everyone, but if you enjoyed the first Red, chances are you'll like this one too.",RED 2

Contrary to many online negative reviews, I thought that the movie was pretty good and hilarious. Watch it for the infectious humour, the impressive stunt driving action especially the one with Lee Byung Hun and Helen Mirren and the silliness of the whole movie, it will definitely make up for your bad day (if you have).His English is pretty good. That's my first thought when I first saw Lee Byung Hun appearing as Han, the best contract killer in the world, who bears a grudge against Frank. (Besides his great physique, of course) He is serious, he is charismatic but he brought quite some laughs. In fact, the way he tried to kill Frank, I would think he's almost insaneThe other character that left me an impression was perhaps Mary-Louise Parker's role as Sarah, Frank Moses' young girlfriend who loves an adventure but sheltered by Frank because he believes that his woman doesn't know how to use a gun (and he's right!) and shouldn't be involved in the mission. Her almost bimbotic actions left me with an open jaw (quite a few times) when she got the team into trouble but somehow and sometimes solved the situation with her own method (by kissing).Enjoy this light-hearted movie with an open mind, if you are planning to analyse in depth the character or plot development, you might be in for a disappointment.For more: http://tiffanyyong.com/2013/07/30/red-2-movie-review/",RED 2

The story lacks humour this time and is more serious but is still very enjoyable.Anyone who hasn't seen RED 1 is interested please go see this. These two films present the best way to make a spy spoof without being ridiculous or completely silly i.e. Johnny English or Austin Powers. The story, action, and setting is serious like a action film however the conversations, skill, and body language these characters have is where the comedy comes from. All is all it's funny without being cheesy, camp, or directly ripping off or referencing other action or spy films. Plus Bruce Willis' character (Frank) is a great parody of his career in action films.I will be content if they don't make RED 3 but if they do I'm really looking forward to it.

146,Cs_The_Moment,Entertaining in the Same Way as the First,7,27 April 2014,"RED 2 picks up neatly from where the first one left off – Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is now happily settling down with girlfriend Sarah (Mary- Louise Parker) when he finds himself dragged back into his old ways by partner in crime Marvin (John Malkovich) on a mission to find a sought- after nuclear device. Much like the first film, RED 2 is full of gun fights, car chases and ridiculous scenarios, but it doesn't take itself too seriously so you can forgive it for that. The plot runs parallel with this theme of un- believability, and some scenes almost feel like an unintentional parody, but it adds to the charm of the film. There are some good laughs throughout, particularly from the ever-quirky John Malkovich, and also from Mary-Louise Parker who again embraces the role of awkward but excitable Sarah with comedic prowess. Bruce Willis is back on standard form, the cool, casual hero who fights his way out of every situation almost effortlessly; but this time his character has mellowed considerably, there are lots of tender moments between Frank and Sarah that are slightly disjointed with his takes-no-prisoners fight scenes. As well as some previous actors making a reappearance such as Dame Helen Mirren, who is on excellent form, there are some new appearances from the likes of Catherine Zeta-Jones who brings a larger than life role as a fiery Russian agent, and Anthony Hopkins as the wise creator of the nuclear device.If you enjoyed the first film then you'll probably enjoy RED 2 as well. It's the same comedic mix of good characters and slightly implausible situations, but for me that's part of the charm: the film doesn't take itself too seriously, it just looks to entertain.",RED 2

Or their cool persona where everyone fit comfortably. If you liked Red (I), it's highly unlikely that you won't like Red(II). Red 2 takes on exactly from where Red 1 left.Synopsis: Retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) along with his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louis) and friend Marvin (Malkovich) goes on quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. They are chased by Han (Byung-hun Lee) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) on the orders of their respective intelligence agencies.Red had a sleekness that Red 2 seems to be missing in some places. However, it has the same panache (may be even more) that Red 1 had. Roping in Byung-hun Lee and Anthony Hopkins was a very smart decision. It looked like the roles were tailor made for them. Byung-hun Lee was a welcomed addition to the Red team. I hope they rope him in the next sequel too. Not only did he have tremendous screen presence, he can also make you laugh with his straight-face humor. Anthony Hopkins as the talkative mad scientist leaves a mark. Bet everyone saw that coming ;)Red 2 also delves into the relationship of Willis and Mary-Louis. It's revealed that after the action packed start, their relationship seems to be getting stale with Mary-Louis craving for something adventurous. Their relationship also suffers a setback with Catherine Zeta Jones walking in as Willis's ex-flame. I'm not sure about Catherine but Malkovish's character seemed a bit out of place than what we remembered him from the last movie. Instead of being a hopeless paranoid, he became a Love-guru for Willis in this movie. Not a deal breaker, coz whatever he does you can't stop cheering for him. Helen Mirren is as elegant as ever with her charming personality. Rest of the cast seemed good. The story is decent and fast paced as expected. Overall, Red 2 is a worthy sequel to Red, and is just as bold and confident. Hope the movie makes a good profit so that we can get the third installment!",RED 2

149,tomhg38,made for octogenarians ?,5,17 November 2013,"Red 2 is very similar to the original. You get a handful of mature actors, put them in generic spy-type situations where they inexplicably excel despite the handicap of arthritis and pepper any situation you can with seemingly meaningless relationship advice.The ""greatest assassin in the world"" is using a 6000 rpm minigun from across the street and somehow not killing the protagonist and his comical relief sidekick, and mid scene they have what passes for snappy repartee.Moses (main character) taking on 15 armed highly trained killers for a 2 minute stretch? you can basically guarantee that hes getting relationship advice from his single friends, which is definitely necessary despite the love of his life seemingly having no problem (in fact outright enjoying) constantly being in near death situations because of his spy lifestyle.The advise itself irked me. The character is clearly the epitome of a ""good guy"", cares protects and respects his partner but is nonetheless told ridiculous things like ""sometimes you just have to dive off the cliff"". The character is too one dimensional to have any need for help: he is unfazed by his girlfriend kissing several strange men, he only wants to protect her from situations she is clearly unqualified to handle. The only way Moses is ever portrayed as imperfect as a partner is when he tries to talk her out of going untrained and inexperienced into gun battles with world renowned assassins and government hit men. And yet on this flimsy basis constant lines are thrown in by people who are clearly somewhat deranged sociopaths who try to ""save"" his seemingly impervious relationship.The movie isn't too torturous, there's just enough time in between the eye rolling and completely inorganic shoe-horned love advice and geriatric banter that you never quite turn it off. Thus for 99% of the film i gritted my teeth when they tried to widen their audience base by force feeding me tips on how to save the world and my love life at the same time, but the finale of the film broke me.Spoiler: Moses walks onto a plane with a mystical super-bomb that he cant defuse, the bad guy has a machine pistol to his girlfriends head, and tells Moses to take the bomb and his girlfriend and get off the plane, blowing themselves, their friends and the majority of London up with them. Moses does as instructed, the ""gang"" expects death and then as the plane with the bad guy flies off into the sunset it blows up: the final ""twist"" if i can be so brazen as to label it such is that somehow despite being meters away from the super genius bad guy the entire time he was on the plane and there being no conceivable way short of 'magic' that he could remove the bomb from the bomb case (where it would presumably have been fastened in anyway) to stash it in the compartment the aforementioned genius is staring at, he does.As a love story it failed dismally, as a spy story / action movie it was abysmal.

He's playing the same character basically as in Fifth Element, but it doesn't seem repetitive. It seems, on seeing Red 2 just now for the second time, that the actors are truly having a romp here, and - unlike the film Mr. & Mrs. Smith, for example, where it seemed that the film was made simply so Brad and Angelina could have a good time, at our expense - somehow we were in on the romp here. It is a great fun movie to watch. I just don't think it would be possible for a director to have kept the combination of Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Anthony Hopkins, Mary-Louise Parker, David Thewliss, Neal McDonough and Catherine Zeta-Jones in a totally wired plot from being entertaining, and I have to hand it to Dean Parisot and the Hoeber brothers for not clamping down on them too hard.

153,harbingerofapocalypse,Rotten Execrable Detritus,2,21 December 2013,"Red was a bore that only barely managed to keep my interest up. Nearly all of the humor was premised upon the assumption that old people kicking butt is inherently funny. It's not. It can be funny. But just having some old folks winning physical fights with people less than half their age doesn't make me automatically burst out laughing. There has to be some effort put into it through dialog or story or character. Red was half-arsed at best. Red 2 doesn't even try that much. I didn't even chuckle once. The writing was garbage. The story was stupid and convoluted. Convoluted, not intricate. It wasn't that way to be exciting and interesting, but to distract you from how stupid the rest of the movie was. It also has some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a major release. Scenes go from one location to another without any kind of transition. People and objects shift positions, action scenes are choppy and hard to follow, and cuts seem randomly made just to give the impression of exciting activity. As far as acting, nothing stood out at all. Except Bruce Willis. And not in a good way. He has made plain his growing distaste for action films. He was once a joy to watch. The destruction and havoc he wrought, combined with humor and good acting, were a form of art. Now he's disgraced himself and brings down every film he's in (Looper being the only recent exception) because he's gotten bored, doesn't give a s**t about his audience that put him where he is, and seem too greedy to just quit. Instead he taunts us with each load of crap like Red 2 that he drags his feet through, giving us hope that someday we'll see another glimpse of his gloriously violent past that was so entertaining.

154,gregorybmowery,One of the Few Sequels that Tops the Original,8,7 July 2014,"I remember being a bit disappointed by the first installment of what now looks like a wonderful retirement franchise and showcase for a bunch of first-rate ensemble actors. So now comes this unexpectedly delightful sequel, and I'm panting for the third installment. Helen Mirren steals the show. What she does with two guns in a speeding sports car has to be seen to be believed. She never oversells a line reading and she's always riveting to watch. Bruce Willis with his patented smirk is just fine leading this band of lethal lunatics. Nobody plays crazy better than John Malkovich, who released from playing serious, is a stitch here. Mary Louis Parker trots out her honed-to-perfection cool and sexy lady routine. It's always been adorable, and she works it to a fine comedic froth. Byung-hun Lee is a wonderful addition to this cast, playing a world-class assassin and getting no respect from the Red team until the final confrontation. Manning the sports car where Helen Mirren has her major moment, he mores than holds his own. Catherine Zeta-Jones has overworked the smoldering femme fatal a bit too often, but her brief time livens up the proceedings. Only Sir Anthony Hopkins is a bit disappointing in an underwritten part. The balance between comedy and action is perfect. This is not a movie to spend too much time thinking about. But it is head and shoulders above most summer movie fare. See if for Mirren, Parker, Willis and Malkovich who were given better material the second time around and made it a huge hit. More please.",RED 2
155,PedroRosRod,Better than the first one!!!! All the way!!!,9,15 September 2013,"Guys, this movie is so entertaining that despite running for almost TWO HOURS you barely notice it. All the major characters deliver flawless performances as far as what this movie demands. Unlike RED 1, this one has a more obvious romantic feel aside the main plot which gives something more to offer to the core story. Needless to say, Anthony Hopkins cast was not disappointing at all. Great action-funny scenes along with a some sort of mindful main plot are among the coolest stuff this flick has to offer to those action and comedy fans looking to feed their hunger.I strongly recommend this one, specially being a Bruce Willis fan!!!You'll have fun and get amazed!!",RED 2
156,uzzie-357-516579,Still good enough but barely,6,12 September 2018,"The movie takes place after the first one so, it is definitely a sequel and not just one that's franchised or whatever. The jokes and plot are about the same as the first but with more exploration and travelling done. Most of the characters remain the same in their quirks or good side of things but there was a bit too much of Sarah being whiny and such an insecure person who's trying not to be useless (but fails at times and succeeds at others) such that it becomes annoying really. Her actions look rather ridiculous in terms of her decision making process. She isn't an agent and hasn't any semblance of a clue regarding the stakes involved at times it would seem and is just too preoccupied with her insecurities and her world and how she should be allowed to do this or something in a subtle and sometimes clear way. That alone made the movie almost a cringe to slog through during those parts.Catherine Zeta Jones was a nice addition that unfortunately didn't add too much but she wasn't a bad addition to the whole dynamics and story, even if it was a bit clichéd. At least, her roles and the way she acted made more sense with regards to the gravity of the situation they were all in. Good and entertaining movie still but with a huge caveat of an insecure character who feels things should include her, or that she should be more important and such a little too much to make it a funny moment than an overdone plot aspect. Tone that down and it would've been more in tune.",RED 2

Plot twists galore. You expect one thing to happen in a scene and it doesn't. Adversaries become allies, good guys become bad guys, bad guys become good guys, the plot twists ya to death.

Bruce and John truly shine in this movie showing how much of a funny, unstable, hilarious and humorously team they are. Bruce Willis is one of those actors whom can pull off both very funny and serious roles without having to shift too far to the left or right. His vast experience as an actor from those days in ""Moonlighting"" to the ""Sixth Sense"" shows just how dynamic his role-playing can be. In this film, he shows in pure ""Willis"" style how to make you laugh, giggle and flinch in one movie. The cast is well picked, action scenes as an ex-Black Ops soldier with all the fancy moves shows how well Bruce can pull off such roles with ease and flare!",RED 2
160,RockoutGlockout117,Passibility Reigns,6,23 July 2013,"I remember seeing the original ""Red"" a few years back with one of my bros, I had just wanted to see a movie and hadn't put much thought into choosing one, it looked like it couldn't be that bad so I'd gone with that one. And I recall walking out and thinking ""That was passable nothing more nothing less, it had good parts and bad parts"" and I also remember thinking that the cast felt like they thought that the movie was a lot smarter and wittier than it actually is. It was like Mary Louise Parker, Willis, and the rest were winking at us every five seconds like ""Oh gee golly! This sure is humorous isn't it?"" And no its not guys, just in case you were wondering, you guys are five times less funny and clever than you think you are. And besides a few standout parts(Willis's Office fight with Karl Urban, and Malkovich playing baseball with a grenade) there was really nothing that notable about the film business as usual, move along nothing to see here folks.And lo and behold! Three years later here comes the sequel!(shows you how happy Hollywood is with Mediocrity, or rather the money mediocrity earns) And this one seems to be a bit better received than the previous film critically, but please don't believe the voices going on about how its so entertaining and fun! Or the TV ads proclaiming it as the only cool movie this summer ""Without Superheroes"" as soon as you are watching this movie you will wish you were watching Man Of Steel, or Iron Man 3! The sad fact is ""Red 2"" finds itself plagued by the exact same problems its predecessor was, a lot of bore, only a tad of spark. This time around the standout moments come from Lee Byung-Hun who most will recognize as Storm Shadow from the G.I. Joe films, he plays an Assassin that is supposedly the greatest contract Killer of all time and one scene that involves him being handcuffed to a Refrigerator door in a market is admittedly pretty darn impressive. But once again, these moments are few and far and the majority of the film we just follow this cast of Jokers who like to imagine that their funny around various locales few of which inspire anything besides boredom, much like the film itself.The most positive thing I noticed about this film is that the 50-60 year olds surrounding me seemed to be really enjoying themselves(much like during the Lone Ranger..) and I guess that's a good thing cause that's who this film is targeted at, and honestly if you really like this film kudos to you! You managed to love a film about which there is very, very, little to love! In Summary if you want a very drab and dull film to go see, you'd probably like Red 2.",RED 2

I am glad to say that this is a good film to watch.Red 2 is funny and action packed. The cast is amazing who all deliver especially Bruce and Johns who relationship is the funniest thing about this film. From the start of the film you know that this going to be good. Bruce and Mary going around Wal-Mart when they bump into John who says they are in trouble and was sent to die. They than go the France, Russia and England and meet Catherine Zeta Jones, Helen Mirren, Anthony Hopkins and Byung Hun Lee who make the film better and entertaining.However there are some negatives. Helen, Byung and Anthony are all underused and should have been in the film more. Also it can get a bit boring at certain points. A good solid film the original is better.",RED 2
162,jamieradford,You're never too old to save the world,7,16 November 2013,"There are times when you go into a movie expecting so much, and walk out disappointed. Occasionally your expectations are small, and you are blown away. With Red 2, you get exactly what you would hope for, and expect – more of the mayhem and over the top action of the films predecessor - 2010's Red (retired extremely dangerous).As in the first film, Red 2 sees Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) trying to live the quiet life, although this time with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), his onetime case worker. While on a shopping trip to Costco, Frank's former partner and best friend Marvin (John Malkovich), approaches Frank and warns him that, ""they're coming,"" just before Marvin's car – with Marvin apparently in it – explodes in the Costco car park.While attending Marvin's funeral Frank is taken by government agents to a 'secure' location to be interrogated about a classified cold war operation named 'Nightshade'. While being questioned, a team of opposing government agents, led by Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) invades the building, wanting Frank for themselves.Against all odds, Frank escapes, and against even more odds is met outside by Sarah, and the very much alive Marvin, who - as was a habit in the first film - had faked his own death, again.What follows is an hour and a half of outrageous, over the top and tongue in cheek entertainment, as the trio fight to clear their names, and save the world from nuclear disaster at the same time. All while being pursued by Horton and various other government agencies around the globe - as well as the worlds 'best assassin', Han, played by Korean actor Byung-Hun Lee.Dame Helen Mirren returns as the gun toting MI6 agent and assassin Victoria, as does her occasional 'friend with benefits' Ivan, played by Brian Cox. They are joined by Sir Anthony Hopkins as former weapons designer and scientist Edward Bailey, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Katja – a Russian agent and former love interest of Frank.Director Dean Parisot has done a more than decent job handling this very diverse and experienced group of actors. Although only his third feature film, he has directed a lot of highly successful television shows, including Justified, The Good Wife and Modern Family, so is used to working with an ensemble cast.While the plot is fairly predictable and the script unexceptional, it does give Parisot enough to develop the characters, and their relationships with one another. Malcovich's Marvin is wonderful, and Helen Mirren is obviously enjoying the vastly different role as a government assassin; and is a stand out as Victoria. Mary-Louise Parker also does a great job as Sarah, as she goes from a naive former case worker to a fully-fledged member of the RED team, and Bruce Willis is – well, Bruce Willis.Red 2 won't win any Oscars, but it will keep you entertained for a couple of hours – and that's what it sets out to do. Yes, it is full of clichés, and most of the action scenes are impossibly over the top, but again, that's what it set out to do. Red 2 is a film that does not take itself too seriously, and neither should you. 7/10",RED 2
163,DiscoVinyl,Better then the first one,9,10 September 2013,"I don't usually enjoy action films that much. But this film had something more. There was humor, and there were stars. Big stars! John Malkovich though very much aging is still a consummate professional. Anthony Hopkins, wow, what a great idea casting him, he didn't disappoint. Neal McDonough has the most piercing eyes I've ever seen in film, a bit wooden as an actor but he had a fun part and played it to the hilt. Helen Mirren was great, always a favorite of mine. Catherine Zeta Jones was fun and sexy. Lot of great outfits on her! Bruce Willis was the same as ever but he seemed to get some real joy out of this role. He was a pleasure to watch. But I'd have to say Mary Louise Parker stole the show. She was brilliant and a fun love interest for Bruce Willis. Byung-hun Lee was great in every scene where he got to fight. A real Bruce Lee in the making.I'm very glad I saw this film. It gave me exactly what I needed, a couple of hours outside myself. I didn't ever start thinking about what was going on outside the film. That usually happens to me in adventure films. At some point I get bored and my mind wanders. This film kept me drawn in straight through. I might even say my heart was racing at times.Of course a lot of the film isn't plausible, but why does it have to be? It was like a comic book. You care about the characters too so you want them to get out of each and every bind.I guess a film like this doesn't do better then films based on super heroes because it is a film for adults. But I'd much rather an action packed, star studded film then any movie based on a comic book or a fantastical film.",RED 2
164,georgeislive21,A Tremendous Amount of Fun,8,7 December 2013,"A group of former assassins and political operatives team up to save the world from nuclear disaster. Don't expect Shakespeare, but do enjoy the ride.PROS: This is big budget action in a ""Die Hard"" vein. Lots of shoot-em-up. Lots of explosions and car chases. Incredible stunt work in a Hong Kong action tradition. But this would be just another in a long line of such pictures if it weren't for the amazing cast and unique slant: these heroes are all ""over-the-hill"" by Hollywood standards. Rather than smothering the fun, their age is played for high comedy. If only stars of this caliber were given opportunities outside such tongue-in-cheek arenas.Bruce Willis essentially plays the same character he has in every action movie he's made for the past 20 years. He's the wise cracking killing machine who remains unflappable no matter how dire the situation. Thankfully, he's actually given a character. In fact, all the other actors (excepting the disposable bad guys) get opportunities to shine.CONS: Viewers shouldn't come to this expecting deep social commentary. This is a large scale action movie, shot round the globe for reasons that are rather suspect, so it's all about watching epic destruction. But if I were to make one observation despite this, it's a little troubling that the ""heroes"" of the picture are just as bloodthirsty and callous as the villains. The only thing separating them is the distinction that, while they both love to kill (and this is repeatedly acknowledged), the heroes do it for ""good"" reasons.We are also repeatedly reminded that this feature is of DC comic origin. In an effort to stamp their product in the same fashion as Marvel, this is reinforced with continuous cartoon segues.I also hate to nitpick, but the weapon that so many people die to recover, the atomic super-weapon that is supposed to destroy 11 million lives if detonated in London, somehow manages to explode after a brief airplane ride over the ocean and inflicts absolutely NO damage on England.

In response to the critics, this is not a movie which is supposed to give you hours of thinking afterward and put philosophical ideas into your head. It is also not the movie aiming at the highest body count/spilled blood volume/special effects records. It is an easy-going action film starring wonderful actors, boasting hilarious lines and definitely NOT targeted at teenage and very young audience (just like The Expendables, IMHO). You have to be at least over 30 to really appreciate the film, the gallantry of ""old school"" agents, the ""evil"" side of Hopkins and the lines of Helen Miller or John Malkovich. You don't get much blood (in spite of spraying bullets etc. - everything is done in a sort of elegant way, that don't make you cringe from the abundance of body parts or blood everywhere). Yes, the plot is a bit shaky, and in some places you have a reasonable doubt as to the way some things develop (e.g. the ease of Helen Miller getting into the ICE facility, or all of them getting in the Kremlin). But that's not the point. The point is the actors, the victory of the Good and the overall mood of the film (which is RED :)) I had a wonderful time yesterday at the cinema, together with my husband.

The best bits in the movie come between Bruce Willis and John Malkovich with both coming out with some very funny remarks. It really is what you expect from a movie like this well made fight scenes and some great car chases. It is great to see the actors and actresses having fun with the characters and the story which is not complicated and does not take too much attention to follow.

Her playing the bumbling, stupid girlfriend really angers me - it actually makes me want to strap C4 to the TV and end all of our misery. I can vaguely remember enjoying Red 1 but this is terrible. The film is running in the background as I type this, I'm being forced to watch it by my Father in Law and I'm trying to kill some time and boredom while it finishes. The plot is awful, cheesy, The FX are terrible and it's like they got to the end of the film and thought hmm, how can we sprinkle glitter on this turd for a finale...?

I bet over 100 people died half way into the movie. In one scene you see Han shooting Frank and Marvin with a machine gun, so much bullets firing them and they don't even die or get shot. That is one of the biggest problems in the movie, the action is way too unbelievable and fake. Victoria is in a car with Han and shoots 2 cars without looking, Frank and Marvin are falling down from the air on a helicopter and they don't die. If that really happened in real life, they would die. I really hated Sarah, she acts like a 2 year old and I think she was not really needed in the movie. Let's talk about the good things about the movie now. Marvin is the best and funniest character in my opinion, his lines are HILARIOUS. Good acting from all the actors and actresses except Mary Louise Parker. The comedy is very funny, but not the best. The movie kinda looked like a comic book and I really found that pretty cool.

In many of my other reviews I come down hard for ridiculous plot lines and lack of believability, but this flick was never intended to be taken seriously on any level. It is a comical take on action/spy movies and so it matters not what liberties are taken.If you enjoy Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, you like non-stop action and you are in the mood for some mindless entertainment, it is worth a watch. No thinking required.Personally, I enjoyed the original Red and I like watching the ""old codgers"" play it up on the action scene. Yes, Helen Mirren is certainly getting old, but she still exudes sex appeal (which has little to do with age or looks) and she is amazingly credible as an action hero. I'd love to see her star in some serious action/spy films.Malkovich is his usual self and plays a small uninspired role. The surprise for me was Anthony Hopkins. He didn't have too much to do here, but more than I thought. He could have fluffed his way through a film like this, but he took the role as seriously as any other and his performance enhanced the film.The humor in this one is not side splitting but it works. They could have hit us over the head with tired, old-timer gags but they were smart and didn't really go that route in this sequel. Overall, I have seen far, far worse in this genre.Just remember this is an over-the-top kind of movie. It's not even close to a typical action comedy. This one has more unbelievable fights, gunfire, chases and general absurdities than five garden variety action flicks combined. I usually don't like super-action movies with nothing but explosions and bullets every two seconds, but in this film the action works and the light comedy keeps pace with it.Watch Red 2 when you want to shut down your brain for a little while and relax with some good old American, explosive, violent, unapologetic, save-the-world, comedic entertainment.",RED 2

When you add a wrinkle to this unrealistic scenario, that is where you can sell movie tickets. Whether it's gender (""Salt,"" ""Tomb Raider,"" etc.) or race, people will pay attention(as long as they are surrounded by enough white men and a white man is their boss. ""Red 2"" is about the people who have quit the spy business but who are being hunted because they represent a threat because of their skill set. This bit of realism is then qualified by the fact that they are all elderly – but, as the myth of white supremacy would have it, appear to not have lost a step in their physicality, their virility when it comes to interest in sex, or their mentality when it comes to snappy one-liners and figuring out the method of operation of the bad guys. At the end of the movie, as a sign of a divine example of disrespect, the $4 jet that belonged to the Asian member of the contingent is blown up when Bruce Willis switches a case that had a bomb in it.

I don't mind stupid comedies, ie Sandler movies - they're stupid but on the other hand they're feel-good movies, but Red 2 was just plain awful - clichés, stupid car chases, shooting - just pointless - I take dumb movies like 'Olympus has fallen' or 'White House down' any time of the day.

Let me introduce you to a much older ensemble. RED-2 starring Bruce Willis(58), John Malkovich(59, looks 69 to me), Hellen Mirren(67), Anthony Hopkins(75, However he looks younger than Malkovich), Mary-Louise Parker(48, Am I the only one who thinks that she looks like an older version of Emma Watson), Catherine Zeta-Jones(43) and Lee Byung- hun(43). The average age of the RED-2 cast is 56.14 with Hopkins being the oldest(Suck on that Chuck Norris you're only 73).Frank Moses(Bruce Willis) with his stellar cast tours Paris,England and Moscow to track down a portable nuclear device created by Edward Bradley(Anthony Hopkins). He's on the Interpol's hit list, MI-6 in the form of Victoria(Helen Mirren) is after him and as well as a paid assassin Han Jo-Bae(Lee Byung-hun). Marvin Boggs(John Malkovich) and Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah Ross help Moses in his quest and they are the most recurring characters in RED-2. Brian Cox as Ivan Simanov to RED-2 is what Chuck Norris(Booker) is to ""The Expendables-2"". Catherine Zeta-Jones(Katja) is present only to infuriate Sarah. David Thewlis as ""The Frog"" has a remarkable role to play.What's a movie filled with spies and Ex CIA-Ops without much action! Writer duo John and Erich Hoeber has made the sequel more serious that suddenly that it appears as if the Batman of 1966 has become Nolanesque(Fanboys don't curse me because this is just a figurative comparison). Yup, the sequel has lost its heart, it was the comical element which made the initial movie amicable. This movie suddenly looks like a mockery of a bond film sans the exotic locations and gadgets. Car chases, private jet blows up in mid air, Kremlin, Portable nuclear device, yawn and Zzzzz.... Wanna make a Bond kind of movie then at least the leading lady should have been attractive. I would have preferred Tina Fey(For comedy) or Uma Thurman(For looks) over ML Parker. As Sarah she does have matured but still something's missing. If people are coming to watch RED-2 its because the first part was foolish and funny in its own way. Who would want to watch John Malkovich as a serious spy, its his goofiness which is a major plus of the movie and he is the only charm of the movie. Of course there is some entertainment in the form of Hopkins but he comes very late in the movie and outperforms everyone. My oh my, how did I forget to mention that this movie has four Academy Award winners. Hope they make it to ""The Razzies"" this time(Except Sir Anthony Hopkins).Its surprising to see that Dean Parisot, previously known for ""Fun with Dick and Jane (2005)"" has made a comparatively serious movie while his predecessor Robert Schwentke who is known for Tattoo(2002) & Flight Plan(2005) came up with a honest action-comedy. Sources say that RED-2 was made because the profit outdid producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura expectations(Why contribute for their benefit ? Are you really gonna watch RED-2). Alan Silvestri's gives us a feel that we're watching a T.V series on BBC One, specially the ones by Steven Moffat. You think that you've had enough of RED ? Well, The Hoeber brothers have already began to develop a third movie for the franchise.The only reason to watch RED- 2 will be because you've watched RED and there are many reasons not to watch it. Its a half baked action comedy spy movie which has failed to hold you, even its aging stars will not amuse you. Why did they even make a movie out of it ? Watch it if you've got all the time in this world.",RED 2

179,thefleece2,A Solid Sequel,6,4 August 2013,"Release Date: 2nd August 2013 (UK) Back in 2010, the original Red proved to be a surprise hit. Whilst the film wasn't exactly innovative, it was great to see all these acclaimed actors and actresses come together to form their own Expendables type group. As a result, the film proved to be a surprise box-office hit, and as you can see, grossed enough to warrant a sequel. However, the question is was a sequel really necessary? The film see's Bruce Willis, now livingly peacefully alongside his girlfriend, played Mary Louise Parker. But as you can imagine that tranquil atmosphere doesn't last very long, when it becomes apparent that a portable nuclear devise must be shut down, before it falls into the hands of the wrong people. Therefore, Bruce Willis reforms his old group RED, to track down and terminate the devise.Whilst I don't recall many of the elements inside the original Red, I do remember enjoying that film. It was an entertaining popcorn flick, released at the time when cinema becomes serious, with potential Oscar contenders taking much of the spotlight. However, when I initially heard that a sequel was in development, I was quite shocked. Because let's be honest, Red isn't really the type of film that warrants a sequel. I don't think anyone left the first film begging for another instalment, but as far as I'm concerned if it entertained me, I was happy and that's exactly what this sequel did, it entertained me.Now of course, arguably the biggest pleasure with both of these films is the cast. This time round we see the recurring faces of Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker and Helen Mirren all returning to portray their respective characters. As well as having new additions such as Catherine Zeta Jones, Anthony Hopkins and Byung-hun Lee adding to an already stellar line-up, and as a result, there is not one bad performance in the entire film, but with these people involved would you really expect anything to go wrong? If I was to single anyone out in particular, it would have to be the legendary Anthony Hopkins, with a special mention also going to Mary-Louise Parker, who I thought was equally as brilliant in the more comedic, sidekick type role.Whilst the pacing can be slightly off, the film is expertly shot, with the action sequences being very well cinematised. Thankfully, I don't recall a single use of shaky-cam and in a 2013 action movie that can prove to be a bit of a rarity. As I said there cannot be a single complaint performance wise and whilst the plot is totally unoriginal and very predictable, it somehow works with the tone of the film.That being said, whilst the first film had a wickedly, sharp sense of humour, this sequel is lacking in that department. It's not a complete travesty, but I didn't find myself laughing as much as I would have liked to. Sure, as an audience member I chuckled here and there, but there was never a time when I felt the need to laugh out loud, and seeing as the humour in the original film was one of the aspects that I recall enjoying the most, for it to be lacking in this sequel was kind of disappointing.But nevertheless, Red 2 is a solid follow-up to original film. It's well-acted and the chemistry everyone shares is unprecedented. Sure, it's not a barrel of laughs or well-paced for that matter, but the final act and set pieces more than make-up for it.6/10 Check out my website: www.jacks-reviews.com",RED 2
180,joesbrook,one of the best action comedy franchises,10,20 July 2013,"Red 2 is one of those action films with nonstop action and has very funny comedy scenes. Red 2 is a pretty rare film with an excellent mix of both. Not many movies with action and comedy are as good as the action comedies of the 80's used to be but this movie hits the mark. The casting is wonderful, especially Anthony Hopkins, who shines as Bailey who is funny and a good action movie villain.The only one I did not really enjoy in the movie was Catherine Zeta Jones, her performance was disappointing because whenever she was in a scene she did not really make you care about her character. Overall, she just did not fit the part. The plot maybe predictable in spots but also has something you don't see coming as well. If you're looking for a movie with nonstop action and laughter red 2 is the best action comedy of the year.",RED 2

182,david-wright96,Good fun,8,12 August 2013,"I will have to say that this is better than the first one. John Malchovich is hilarious as usual and Antoney Hopkins is a brilliant villain. The plot is simple enough to understand, Willis and Malchovich are framed and are believed to have been involved in some nuclear plot during the cold war. Filled with plenty of action and laughs RED 2 is an enjoyable film for everybody. There was a very good cameo from David Thewlis as 'the frog' he's a very good French man. The cast work well together in this action comedy flick. Mary~Louise Parker I've found is very good looking. Helen Mirren I feel is a very elegant psychopath. That's just my opinion.

The scenes seem so exaggerated from the first chapter all the way to the end.I am very glad i decided to rent it first and not buy it.

184,weinabena,excellent,10,15 December 2013,Loved it! Has just enough action comedy and great acting to keep me interested. The movie started with action and ended with action.The fight scenes were decent not a bunch of gory blood and guts. It was interesting to see how Bruce Willis relationship was progressing since RED. The banter between the characters was a bit predictable. The story line was vague at first i suspect on purpose then came together only to keep you on edge with more plots and twists to the story. Anthony Hopkins did a good job and was a great addition to the story line i wished Morgan Freeman showed up. Overall i enjoyed the movie. I hear there is a three coming out can't wait!,RED 2

However I was pleasantly surprised to find it actually satisfactory. But that's it, just satisfactory. In addition, how is it that this group of ""super spies"" has a way to get out of every single jam that presents itself. That, coupled with the improbability of some scenes just makes parts of the film laughable because they're so absurd. But then again, the parts which are actually intended to be funny succeed quite well. It entertained me yes, but would I recommend seeing it in theaters, no. I would wait until it ends up on Netflix or something of that sort. Nothing amazing, but hey, who's expecting to be knocked off their feet by an average run-of-the-mill summer action movie.

This movie is made for those who watch movie for entertainment and not for criticizing. Bruce Willis & the rest gang is returned with a bang and missions just like mission impossible type. All goes wild and make heck of a ride. I love this type of movies- international locations, some mind twisting plans, action, comedy, twists, suspense etc. A perfect mixture for total entertainment.

A pro all-star cast, with Mary-Louise Parker stealing the show. It has all the twists and turns one could fit into its running time. The tag should be, ""I didn't see that coming."" Don't let it fool you. This is a romantic comedy, set in a spy thriller. Right from the start, Frank Moses is a man in love and ready to settle down, despite a life of danger and espionage, but he's in love with Sarah, but he doesn't realize that she has a acquired a taste for living dangerously. The rest of the film is a resolution of that relationship plus what you'd expect from a collection of James Bond types, but tongue in cheek and lots of fun.Listen for the music being played at the funeral near the beginning. My rating is based on how well it achieves what it sets out to be and its panache.",RED 2
188,Crave,"Mostly predictable spy thriller, includes anti-Iranian racism",1,1 January 2014,"Willis and company are back in a dumbed down retread of RED 1. I could spend a couple of paragraphs talking about the plot, but the truth is if you've ever seen a Bond movie you already know the drill. Nuclear terrorism, MI-6, CIA, rogue operatives, blah blah blah. The movie occasionally has moments of intrigue and there are a few surprises. Mary Louise-Parker gets a chance to kick some ass and Anthony Hopkins is enjoyably diabolical. But the majority of smart, character-driven twists and flourishes from the original are absent here. I must also mention the appalling Iranian embassy scene in London. Apparently all Iranians in this embassy are terrorists, which of course gives Willis et al. free license to shoot, stab or explode anyone with dark skin and black hair. Granted, some of the terrorists in this story are indeed Iranian, but to cast an entire embassy as bad-guys simply for the sake of an exciting shootout is unforgivable. If Jason Bourne had acted similarly in the US embassy, for example, and killed every American soldier in the building, the movie would have been boycotted.The embassy scene represents maybe five minutes in the movie's two hour run time but there is absolutely no excuse for it. Even if RED 2 was spectacular entertainment, this scene would make it unwatchable.RED 2 (w/o embassy scene): 5.5/10 (w/ embassy scene): 0/10",RED 2

I think we need a movie about as realistic espionage thriller and mystery as dramatic accents include, for in fact no one takes responsibility for anything, all ""because the Government"". The Government is involved in these events triggered by intelligence agencies, the condition worsens in the world, that such wars are born.

But when I watched the trailer I was actually very excited. It is a sequel to the first red starring Bruce Willis. It was the old team reuniting for another attack. The thing I really liked is the fact that the bad guys were from all around the world. But what made me give it a 9, not a 10 is the fact they didn't include Morgan Freeman like they did in the first one. But otherwise it was excellent! It also includes tons of laughs.

I took away a star for predictability but the overall movie was not as predictable as it could have been there were some small surprises. I suppose the whole premise (A suitcase ""Gasp"" nuke ""Gasp"") was a bit much and stretched the believable limits a little.

The movie was good and I expected it to be just action but nothing else, but it had a good balance between outer and inner motivation in the script. The story was told from different groups of the character's point of views, which was good because it made it easy to understand while still keeping the emotion and character clear. The plot although a little bit cliché was clever and did have a few good twists in it. The character and acting was very good as each person kept displaying their own unique character in reaction to different situations and all the characters had some sense of humor and was serious at times but also appeared funny although this showed some variation, it did make it unclear at times to truly see the character's personality. The special effects in the movie were alright and used sparingly. Almost all the characters changed in some way throughout the movie the biggest changes took place with Frank and Sarah. The stunts in the movie were also intense and were mostly realistic but some were quite ridiculous.The action and thinking needed for the plot were balanced out with some emotional scenes to get to know the characters better and some humor. So in conclusion red 2 was a good movie which was balanced. Inner Motivation= 7 out of 10 outer motivation= 8 out of 10 final rating= 7.5 out of 10",RED 2
193,RaidenReviews,Retired ex-agents unite to recover a missing nuclear device that holds the fate of the world.,8,30 January 2014,"Some sequels usually don't live up the original, but in this case Red 2 outperforms it's predecessor with flying colours. Considering R.E.D is based on a comic book series, Red 2 gives it more of a illustrated comic book feel especially in it's transitions between scenes and the slow- motion action styles. In addition to the epic all-star cast from the first Red, movie legends Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones join the Red squad. Hopkins plays a senile weapons expert while Zeta-Jones takes on the role of the sexy Russian spy. Willis, Malkovich, Mirren, Mary Louise-Parker and Brian Cox reprise their roles from the first film. Red 2 contains elements of deception, which really shows the shifting in trust between the characters. Like every action movie, Red 2 is filled with, you guessed it, guns, lots of them. Guns everywhere, gunfights, gun battles and even a car chase mixed with a gunfight. If explosive action mixed with a diverse plot is what your looking for, Red 2 definitely will meet those requirements. Common throughout spy/action films, there is the constant location change from Paris, London and all throughout Europe, giving it kind of a global perspective emphasizing the importance of the task the Red gang faces.Red 2 is fluent, well- written, and uses the unique characters to deliver a witty, smart and dark comedic twist to a thrilling action experience.

The plot is too thin and just keeps adding another twist to the plot to hopefully hold your interest but when all is said and done, it's not that good. Some of the characters seem to have changed from the original. Sarah was a good next door neighbor type but now she's a arrogant bi - - - that thinks she knows more than her ex CIA boyfriend. Just a quickly put together money grabbing movie. So if you ask me, don't waste your money on it.

It had clever and well-thought out jokes throughout the film. The jokes kept coming and were very skillfully timed. The action was thrilling. Along with the jokes, non-stop action to get your blood pumping filled this film. They kept the same feel of cool, unreasonable stunts and explosions from the first movie, but they also added a lot more hand-to-hand combat, which was still very amusing to watch and excellently choreographed. The acting was great and the story was well-written with actual twists. The soundtrack and sound effects made all the guns and explosions that much more convincing and enjoyable.

If they make another one, then these two need to be more central to the story. Willis is Willis, there is not much to expect there. His best parts are when he overcome overwhelming numbers of bay guys and walks away as if it was just another day at the office. Malkovich's role was not a good as the first time, but that character really is somewhat one dimensional even if quirky. Mary-Louise Parker was not used to her fullest. Seemed like the writers couldn't find the right balance; I know what they we going for, but it just did not come across as well as it could have. The Frog should have been a really cool cameo like Richard Atkinson, or one of the Bonds, or better yet, Mike Myers or Steve Martin.

207,thegamergare,Not as good as the first. But still a fun comic book movie.,7,17 May 2014,"I went into this with mixed opinions. I didn't expect to hate it or love it. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first and I knew I wouldn't dislike it. I thought it would be like a 6.5 or 6.8 but I can actually say it was a solid 7.0.A good chunk of the actors return (no Morgan Freeman for obvious reasons), Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, John Malkovich as the hilarious Marvin, Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah and Helen Mirren as the awesome Victoria. And a few new characters who are actually good and fit right in the universe. First is Anthony Hopkins who plays Bailey, it's a simple character, but come on, it's Anthony Hopkins. Byung-Hun Lee plays Han Cho Bai and I was quite surprised by his character. I thought I would hate a young cast member, but he actually fits in quite well. It gives you a sense of the generations of assassins and that they're not just all the same. And maybe I'm just a sucker for the business suit assassin, but its nice to see that you can throw in a young actor who holds his own and manages to actually make the older cast pop out a little more. The one character I wasn't really crazy about, Neal McDonough's Jack Horton. He was funny, but a very simple character that is pretty forgetful, which is unfortunate because all the other characters are very rememberable, so when you have a forgetful one, he takes away from the movie a little more than he would in other movies. And the final character is Catherine Zeta Jones as Katja. She was great but definitely not by herself, she just worked with the other cast and was definitely a great addition to the movie.The story is pretty simple, but I was glad that they managed to step up the threat from the last one, although the villain's motives aren't totally clear. It's just kind of like, he's doing it because he wants to, but it can be forgiven as this universe is so crazy, it's what you'd expect. I did like the comic book feel to this movie, although the transitions from city to city are really ripped off from the first one, I did like the intro and the transition where the character turned into their comic book counterpart was nice, it reminded me that while this is an action movie, it is just as much a comic book movie. And there's a bit of a hidden visual style in this movie I found. Some shots seemed to really pop the colours and the costume design was very simple and comic book like.I don't know if the humour is better or not as good this time as I did laugh but I don't know if I laughed more the first time or more this time. There was some jokes I didn't laugh at, but none were really bad, all the jokes were funny, I just didn't laugh outside sometimes. I do think the action is a bit of step up, (although there's no scene that is as awesome as the final of the first R.E.D.) I was surprised how well everything was choreographed, there were moments of cgi, but I don't mind in a comic book movie and they were small and far apart, they were only there when necessary (surprisingly yes, they were necessary.)In the end, if you thought R.E.D. was okay/decent you probably won't like R.E.D. 2, but if you liked the first then the 2nd one is definitely worth watching, even if it's just for free on TV.Score: 7.0",RED 2
208,an-pham1189,Fun and entertaining!,10,13 November 2013,"Don't let people fool you into believing that this movie is not good. It IS good, and worth the money. Interesting characters (I don't like Sarah, she's dumb, but the others are fine), good actions, not too CGI-overloaded, absolutely entertaining and fun to watch - if that's what you seek for I highly recommend this movie to you. It's as good as, if not better, than the first movie - which is something that's really rare in sequels. But actually you know, I had to write this review just to say I don't understand WHY THIS MOVIE'S RATING IS WORSE THAN THE WOLVERINE'S. Seriously. Just go watch this if you haven't already.",RED 2

210,MobiusJedi,Buckle up! Red 2 is every bit as fun as the first.,8,16 February 2014,"You want high octane action, plenty of witty quips, and at least one good chase scene? Of course you do, that's why you're at the page of an action flick. Well, worry not. This piece of guns and glory picks right up where the first installment left off, and doesn't overuse the elements that made the first Red so much fun.That would boring. Bruce Willis isn't boring.Malkovich, Mirren, Hopkins and Parker are likewise unfamiliar with the concept. (Zeta-Jones is just a little more acquainted with boring, but hey, she filled the demands of her role.)Anyway, Red 2 is one of those few sequels which not only lives up to the first, but even maintains momentum for the franchise, all without relying so much on the original that it would all be gimmicks. Instead, Red 2 relies on its own novelty with a fresh plot, and even a fresh subplot between Frank and his girl -- which may or may not boil down to shoes, but hey, what a girl wants, right? {Dear God, why did I have to recall a 1999 Christina Aguilera hit!?}. *Ahem* As I was saying, I'm assuming this continued freshness has a lot to do with the source material (I've never read the comic, but it must be pretty killer.) Of course, with Willis and Malkovich, what else should we, the audience, expect? Awesome. We should expect awesome.Just make sure you're in action flick mode before watching, or you'll ruin everything. No, really; everything. The best action movies don't have time for you to take them too seriously. Just ask the Governator.",RED 2

I thought, maybe this time they really somehow managed to make decent sequel (rare phenomena, as you know, especially, in comedy field). But no – this was typical sequel (crap) – stuffed with ""used to be popular but aging fast"" movie stars doing pseudo-intellectual blah-blah-blah whenever they have a slightest chance (this time it was ""marriage consultations"" for Willis and his girlfriend). As a comedy it was a crap (as it was NOT funny), and also it was a crap as an action movie (better go and see some James Bond or Mission Impossible if you are looking for some action). Not even close to the original RED. Believe me. Do not waste your time on this BS.",RED 2

They have this warped idea of what movies are about. The best movies are usually the ones where you enjoy yourself.I liked RED but I absolutely loved RED 2.It was awesome to watch: funny, cheeky, and had surprisingly good action scenes that even though I'm pretty accustomed to seeing dozens of people die at the hands of some hot-shot, I was in awe of some of the fight scenes.So, bottom-line is that you'll enjoy yourself, despite all the pedantic and unnecessarily haughty comments from people who just can't accept that a movie can be awesome without having a deep, intricate plot and allegorical messages.

Bruce Willis is a retired black-ops CIA agent Frank Moses. He reunites with spy friends in a journey to track down a missing nuclear bomb. If you like action, thoughtful movies with a touch of dark comedy, you will absolutely love this movie. This is entertainment in the best sense of the term. The action sequences are great. The multitude of plot twists and the interpersonal relationships are mind challenging. The actors, Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, John Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Helen Mirren, Neal McDonogh, Mary Lou Parker and especially Byung-Hun Lee are all superb!

It was funny, witty, snappy, lively, sarcastic, engrossing and entertaining. I literally walked out of the movie trying to figure out what stick the critics have up their butts, since it was IN NO WAY inferior to the first film. Period. Now, you could quibble with the first film, if you want, but you could quibble with almost any movie. You could complain about inconsistencies, impossibilities, character schtick, etc. etc. etc. But none of those were significant problems in the first, and none of them are problems in the second.It is fun, escapist entertainment that is a very worthy successor to the original.

217,yestennis,a mindless offering,1,3 August 2013,"Some have suggested that Red2 is better than Red. However, I had the opposite reaction. I was hoping for an intelligent script interlaced with some good humor. For me, Red2 had neither. Rather, it focused on an endless parade of unrealistic car chases, gun fights, hand-to-hand combat and pyrotechnics. If that's your recipe for a good movie, you'll enjoy Red2. However, if you're looking for a thoughtful, sophisticated crime drama with originality, Red2 is not for you. It simply serves up a huge plate of the same action clichés you've seen numerous times before. Plus, it's a shame that the acting talents of Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins were wasted on Red2. There are no surprises here. Red2 is quite predictable. You won't be sitting on the edge of your seat.",RED 2
218,nuggsgalore,"Not as good as the first, but entertaining",7,19 July 2013,"Unfortunately, the chemistry and charm of RED 1 is is just not there for this one. The plot seemed all over the place and it really felt like they took all the cool scenes from RED and tried to duplicate them in a new way. That is not to say that RED 2 doesn't have its moments. One big disappointment, however, is Bruce Willis' character. He goes from a hard ex-CIA operative to kind of a weenie, overly concerned with his love interest's well being. There are a couple of surprises that are fun and will make you smile, but all in all it is a mediocre attempt at a sequel. Another disappointment was the fact that according John Malkovich there was another pig scene filmed and it seems it landed on the cutting room floor. Maybe it will be on a directors cut or something.",RED 2

Even such amazing actors as Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich and Anthony Hopkins didn't help. It's just very boring. For a whole movie the viewer is waiting for something to happen but it's just not happening. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of action but... Let's just say everything is very easy to predict.Cartoon edits, which look like being taken from marvel comics and pop in every once in a while, are very annoying. It looks as if this movie is good only in the prism of ads of Pringles, lotus, Papa Johns. Those brands are very well highlighted. It makes you want to think if those companies paid to produce this movie or if it is just a happy coincidence. Second part is almost never as good as a first one but in this case it's just very bad.",RED 2

While it's a great move to do more about Willis love life, she literally ruins the movie in every scene she's in. However, it's very enjoyable to watch Helen Mirren doing more action in this sequel than the first one, and they perfectly cast Hopkins as Bailey. Hopkins and Lee really gives a convincing and enjoyable performances, while Willis and Malkovich are 'okay'. Oh yea, almost forgot with Zeta-Jones, probably because she gives a forgettable performance (but still pretty like usual)There are some disappointing direction of the story (like Sarah that tags along, and Willis character become SO weak that they should have called him retired-extremely- delicate ) , but overall it was enjoyable enough to watch.",RED 2

Bruce Willis and John Malcovic held the movie together, and the twists and turns as the scenario unfolded, while sometimes predictable, still held our interest and made the time pass quickly.Add to that the comedic side of both RED 2 and RED (the original) and we kept laughing through the entire movie.The only reason I didn't rate it a 10 was I wish Morgan Freeman had been in this one too!",RED 2
223,artrouselkn,Funnier if you have seen RED,7,21 July 2013,"I enjoyed it and recommend it. But, there are a lot of inside jokes that you may not understand if you haven't seen the original RED. They are after Frank Moses again because of something he has done in the past as a CIA black ops operative. Frank, Sarah and Marvin have to discover who is after them and why and travel the world following clues where they are re-united with Victoria and eventually Ivan. There is a new character, Katya, from Frank's past. The humor is a bit more slapstick. There is a lot of violence and death as Frank and the others prove that the old guys still have it, but it is not graphic violence. Bottom line, rent RED, then go see this movie.",RED 2
224,IrishEyes1989,"Fun, but not as good as the original **SPOILERS**",7,19 July 2013,"I have been looking forward to this sequel to the fantastic 2010 film RED for ages. As soon as I heard that a second instalment was being made, I was very excited. Seeing the trailer for RED 2 made it look even better than the original. Unfortunately, this one turned out to be one of those movies where the trailers are actually better than the film itself (this coming from a huge fan of the first one). Believe me, I thought this one was going to blow its predecessor right out of the water, but I was wrong. Though, it wasn't all bad.I'll start with the good aspects of the film. First of all, the team from the original were all reunited (minus Morgan Freeman, of course) which was one of the biggest selling points for the film. The brilliant interplay and repartee between Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker was just great. They all have such good chemistry, it just works. Another thing that I loved was that Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) played a much more involved role this time around, deservedly so. Also, they brought back Brian Cox for a few scenes, which was brilliant. Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones joined the cast this time around. Sir Hopkins is his usual excellent playing a British scientist locked up in a London asylum since the Cold War for actions that set the pace for the film's central plot. Zeta-Jones plays a Russian special agent who used to work with Frank. Sir Hopkins is his usual excellent while CZJ's performance is nothing special. She has become a bit of a has-been, in my opinion. One other thing I will hand to this film is that I loved the transitions between scenes (and locations) using graphic art overlays. Very cool.Now on to the negatives. This film takes a long time to pick up speed. I actually found myself feeling a little bored until about halfway through. It wasn't until then that some good bona fide action sequences, similar to those of the first film, took place. It just felt to me like there was a lot of unnecessary dilly-dallying. Close enough to the structure of the first film, I suppose, but maybe that's why it felt stale. It worked in the original because we needed that time to get to know the characters. In this one it just felt like they were stalling the action for no reason. I got the impression that they used the exact same formula for this film as the first one, but that it didn't work this time. All of the same elements that made the original a success were present here, but it just didn't have the same feeling this time. Perhaps that's just me though. I think the bottom line is that my expectations for this sequel were way too high. Go and see it though because you may just love it!",RED 2

Thank God someone still knows how to make a real good movie that is well written, well played and fun to watch. John M. is so funny in this movie as is most of the cast that at times you actually forget that this story is about a weapon of mass destruction. I salute all involved in this film as the acting was superb! Hopkins and Parker really add to Red 2. A Summer Smash Hit and should last forever on television afterward as the movie didn't need cussing, drugs or nudity to make it interesting. Mind you there is a bit of violence and things do tend to explode a bit much, but most of this is done with humor still in the eye of destruction. I can say that if you see one movie this summer go see Red 2 I did and I can tell you I spent this Friday night laughing my ass off as was everyone else in the theater. #2 Red is better than #1 so if you saw the first movie you gotta go see this one too!Goodbye McClain.

Movie making is an art where you have to walk that fine line - keeping it real enough that the audience can buy into the plot, yet making it exciting enough to keep their attention. When every scene turned into someone singlehandedly demolishing 20 skilled opponents... you just lost my buy in. IMDb says my review has to have 10 lines of text. But I've said all I need to say.

RED was either fast, killer action, or really funny all the way through, with tons of witty, even hilarious, dialogue. I, of course, expected the same here but this film actually was kind of slow-moving until about the last 10 minutes or so, when I suddenly felt like, ""Now THIS is what I was expecting!""

Everyone here is doing their best to make it as fun as the first time around, but the style and direction really make it hard to engage with them.This one did have some good fight scenes and a pretty good aerial chase and there is some travel to interesting locations, as well. The first 20 minutes are pretty great in general too, and overall, it's not a bad movie by any stretch.
