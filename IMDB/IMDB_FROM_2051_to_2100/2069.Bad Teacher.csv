0,bkoganbing,Cameron And Her Boob Job,4,15 July 2011,"Bad Teacher is a comedy about one who is precisely that and the title role is played by Cameron Diaz. She thinks she's through with teaching, but a bad breakup convinces her that she needs a little frontal enhancement to get the man of her dreams. But cosmetic surgery doesn't come cheap so it's back to work and at a teacher's salary it won't be easy. Remember her insurance won't cover it.Diaz is the kind of teacher that you don't learn much from, but does give those junior high school boys a lot of wet and sleepless nights. But when she finds out that a $5700.00 bonus will come with a class that has the best scholastic achievement, it provides a powerful motive for her to actually teach and cut a few corners.In the meantime Diaz has to deal with fellow teachers Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal who both thinks her measurements are just fine as they are. She also has to watch for Lucy Punch who plays a popular teacher looking to nail her in a scandal. Punch has some of the best moments in this film, she apparently modeled her character on the happy homemaker character Betty White created on the Mary Tyler Moore Show back in the day. Jillian Armenante best known for being on the Judging Amy Show a few years back plays Diaz's confidante among the teachers.Bad Teacher was an interesting idea for a film that didn't quite make it. It has some good moments, but I never could develop a rooting interest as to whether Cameron gets her money for that boob enhancement. In fact males of junior high school and high school age will like Bad Teacher, but I think it will fall flat among adults.",Bad Teacher
1,SnoopyStyle,Mean Cameron Diaz could be funnier,7,20 October 2013,"Gold digger Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) gets dumped by her rich fiancé. She's forced to go back to teaching middle school which she hates. Now her main goal is to get a rich man to take care of her and the first step is breast implants. These's a new rich teacher Scott (Justin Timberlake) in school and she has a new target.Cameron Diaz is completely inappropriate, but she's not as funny as she needs to be. She's simply a meanie, and not always funny at it. It could be considered subversive but it keeps pulling its punches.Lucy Punch plays the uptight Amy Squirrel determined to out Diaz's horrible character. I love her normally but her accent is really distracting. I have no idea what that was suppose to be, but I'd rather she keeps her British accent. She could have been a great crazy foil to Diaz.The script just needs more jokes with punchlines. Many times Jake Kasdan makes Cameron Diaz mean and expect it to be funny. That's a joke with diminishing returns. Mind you she was never a stand up or a professional joke teller.",Bad Teacher
2,Prismark10,Lessons is life,4,7 February 2014,"Bad Teacher is a wannabe amoral tale about Cameron Diaz playing a selfish character.The Bad Teacher of the film who puts less than minimum effort, does not care about her students and is looking to marry a rich guy.However when she gets dumped she returns to teaching to earn enough money to enlarge her boobs and get another rich guy to marry.Of course despite Diaz doing her best we cannot care about such a character and end up sorry for her pupils who have to watch endless films on television during lessons.Justin Timberlake turns up as a shallow nerd who is descended from a rich family but his character is just pointless.Lucy Punch is the nemesis and provides spirited resistance to the bad teacher and be the foil but you know she will get beaten to the punch by the end of the film.Jason Segel has a small role as a laconic gym teacher. The schoolchildren are the usual mix of geeks and cool kids but the film is a one note idea.A few laughs, some sexy scenes such as Diaz washing cars save this from being a bad film. At least there is redemption with Diaz finding out she is better at counselling than teaching.",Bad Teacher
3,claudio_carvalho,"Politically Incorrect, Brainless but Hilarious",7,11 January 2012,"The gold digger Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) quits her job as a teacher at the JAM High School expecting to marry her wealthy fiancé. However, he calls off their engagement and Elizabeth returns to the school. Elizabeth is reckless, incompetent, pothead and does not give any attention to the students and her coworkers, and she shows movies to her students along the classes. The envious teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) hates Elizabeth and they are estranged to each other. When Elizabeth meets the substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), she discovers that he is very rich and she flirts with him. Further, she learns that Scott likes big breasts and she decides to have a surgery of silicone-implant. She needs to raise US$ 10,000.00 for the breast-implant, and she learns that the teacher that gets the best scores in the state exam would receive US$ 5,700.00 bonus. Elizabeth changes her attitude and teaches her students to prepare them for the exams. However, Elizabeth uses an unethical means to win the competition and Amy seeks evidences to prove that Elizabeth has cheated the exams.""Bad Teacher"" is a politically incorrect, brainless but very hilarious film. Cameron Diaz performs the most awful teacher of cinema history, the opposite of Sidney Poitier in ""To Sir with Love""; Edward James Olmos in ""Stand and Deliver"" or Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Dangerous Minds"". Elizabeth Halsey is a slut, pothead, reckless, gold digger, corrupter, cheater, blackmailer and everything that is not good. But I Laughed a lot with this forgettable film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Professora sem Classe"" (""Teacher without Class"")",Bad Teacher
4,nogodnomasters,SERIOUSLY?!?!,8,4 May 2018,"Cameron Diaz plays an extremely self-centered individual who is looking for a rich man to marry after her fiancee dumped her because she was a gold digger. (She claims she caught him with the dog and peanut butter.) Teaching junior high gets in her way as she ""needs"" augmentations to be able to compete with all those Barbie Dolls out there. She uses movies to babysit her class. The gym teacher is interested in Cameron (she don't date gym teachers). Cameron in turn has her eyes on a nerdy substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake) whose family comes from money. He however likes Amy Squirrel.Meanwhile in class there is a student who could be a young self centered Diaz who badgers a boy who shows her interest, sort of a parallel to her ""miserable"" life. Lucy Punch plays Amy Squirrel (as a red head) an overly perky teacher who becomes Diaz's school nemesis. Diaz helps the junior high car wash using moves she learned watching Paris Hilton commercials, pocketing some of the money for her ""t#t jar.""The movie changes gears when Cameron finds out the teacher whose class gets the best test scores gets a bonus. The outrageous practices of Diaz both as an apathetic and serious teacher is the core of the movie.F-bomb, nudity(not Diaz or Punch), crude sexual humor, Timberlake dry humping Diaz, bad music, worse poetry, and Lincoln rolling over in his grave.",Bad Teacher
5,kosmasp,Bad Apple,5,5 March 2012,"There is a certain energy in that movie. Especially at the beginning when Cameron Diaz seems invincible she has the time of her life (almost literally). There is a great sequence where she kinda falls down though which sets of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately even though it does make sense for her character, it does loose quite a bit of its pace from that point on.Justin Timberlake is good in playing kind of against character and does not care about what people may think. Jason Segel is almost underused in this one and even Cameron Diaz did not really have that many great moments overall. And for a movie that tries to stay raunchy, it does even fail at combining that with the funny elements. While deliciously evil at times (and good), it also misses the point half of the time. Not really bad, but not that good either (I only watched the cinema release and not the extended cut)",Bad Teacher
6,lee_eisenberg,get an education,5,15 April 2018,"Jake Kasdan's ""Bad Teacher"" is an unabashedly silly movie. Given Cameron Diaz's characters antics, Jack Black or Melissa McCarthy could've just as easily played the role. There's also the occasional bodily function humor.Obviously the movie's nothing to take seriously. Just a big excuse to be ridiculous. Probably the sort of movie that they had fun making. It was a surprise to see that one of the screenwriters shares a name with me (he also wrote for the US version of ""The Office"").Basically, it's the sort of movie that you watch if you want nothing except to get entertained. Watch for Paul Feig (the director of 2016's ""Ghostbusters"") in an appearance as a dad at the car wash.",Bad Teacher
7,jboothmillard,Bad Teacher,4,12 March 2014,"I saw the trailer for this film once or twice during the time of it's release, I could tell it was going to be one of those films that wouldn't really grab many people, even before I saw any critics giving negative reviews, but I still tried it, from director Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story). Basically Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a teacher at John Adams Middle School in Chicago, but she is immoral and makes no effort to actually teach, she curses her students, she drinks heavily, she smokes marijuana, and her lessons all consist of showing the class movies while she sleeps. Being a gold digger she plans to quit the job and marry her rich fiancé, but he dumps her when he realises she is only after him for his money, so she is forced to stay in the job in order to get a potential boob job she is saving for, and then then she is told that there is a bonus for the teacher who has high scoring classes. So she makes much more effort to improve her students and actually teach them stuff they need to learn, her competition dedicated but overly enthusiastic teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), and substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who is wealthy, but she may be much more interested in winning him over than his money. Elizabeth makes more attempts to look more dedicated, raising money for good causes and preparing her students for their exams, and during this gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) keeps telling her he is romantically interested in her, but the feeling is not mutual, and Amy is trying to find dirt on her female rival to expose her for bad teaching and stop her getting the bonus. In the end, after the downfalls go away and normality is restored, as you would expect, Elizabeth proves herself a good member of staff, she rejects a relationship with Scott and forms one instead with Russell after all, she does not go ahead with the breast enlargement feeling comfortable as she is, and she gets a new position as student and teacher guidance counsellor. Also starring Phyllis Smith as Lynn Davies, John Michael Higgins as Principal Wally Snur and Dave Allen as Sandy Pinkus. Diaz does relatively alright as the hopeless educator, occasionally being sexy washing a car or whatever, Timberlake and Segel and other supporting cast do fine as well, but this film is indeed a misfire, there just isn't anything original, with the title you just know it is predictable, only one or two of the jokes made me titter, but no really big laughs, overall it is a disappointing comedy. Okay!",Bad Teacher
8,BA_Harrison,Doesn't make the grade.,2,25 December 2019,"A foul-mouthed, hard-drinking, pot-smoking, gold-digging, self-obsessed teacher (Cameron Diaz) tries to raise money for a boob job so she can land herself a rich boyfriend and give up working for a living. In the course of doing so, she embezzles cash from a school fund-raiser, lures an exam-board worker to his office with the promise of sex before drugging him and stealing the latest test sheets, and frames a hard-working and honest co-worker for the possession of drugs (after stealing her boyfriend). By the end of the film, Diaz's character is still as morally reprehensible as ever, having learnt nothing about the value of teaching (except for the monetary rewards that comes with results), which makes the whole sorry mess a totally pointless exercise. The moral of the movie seems to be 'do whatever the hell you want, no matter how it affects those around you'. What a lovely sentiment!Jake Kasdan, director of the recent Jumanji movies, fails to raise many laughs, working from a puerile and vulgar script that is more embarrassing than it is funny. Diaz is there, of course, to flaunt her body, which she does a lot, and she is still in cracking shape for someone knocking on the door of 40; however, time has been less forgiving on her face, which prevents her from being the complete sexy package that she is supposed to be in this film. To sum up: zero life lessons learnt, cringeworthy comedy, and a star who looks good in daisy dukes, but whose shelf life as a sex symbol is clearly coming to an end.",Bad Teacher
9,paul_haakonsen,Shouldn't it be 'Terrible Teacher' ?,3,30 September 2011,"For a movie of this caliber, I had expected more. Sadly, this movie was not all it could have been.The storyline in itself is good enough, there is a hint of comedy, romance and drama in it. But the whole part about a teacher getting away with just showing movies every day to the students is so lame and not believable at all. Plus, as a comedy there weren't all that many funny scenes throughout the movie.They did have a great cast list assembled for this movie, and although Cameron Diaz (playing Elizabeth Halsey) is the headliner on the poster/movie cover, it was definitely Lucy Punch (Amy Squirrel) who carried the movie with her performance and character. Jason Segel (playing Russell Gettis) was also good. Personalyl I am not fond of musicians turned actors, so I was not keen on Justin Timberlake (playing Scott Delacorte) in this movie. Another great person in the movie was Thomas Lennon (playing Carl Halabi), his character was nice.Having seen the movie, I can honestly say that it is a movie that I will not be making a return trip to, it just didn't rock my world in any possible way. I will say that having seen it is great, because Lucy Punch was hilarious in this movie.",Bad Teacher
10,edwagreen,Bad Teacher-Bad Example 0*,1,4 February 2012,"Who made this film? Mayor Bloomberg, or New York's Daily News or Post? This is just something they would concoct in their never ending assault on teachers. Teachers come across as lazy, incompetent, uncaring people, who smoke weed on the side and engage in outrageous behavior as well.What a role for Cameron Diaz! I read somewhere that in real life she couldn't wait to get out of high school.While this is supposed to be a comedy, it was made at the wrong time. Teachers are terribly unappreciated by society and this piece of junk only adds fuel to the anti-teacher venom spreading throughout the country.The Peter Principle is applied here at the film's end, but by then you're really annoyed at what you've seen during the 90 minutes that this garbage is on film.By the way, where were the parents if the teacher were as bad as the film depicted? The principal was also out to lunch. As for the one supposedly outstanding teacher in the building, if her's was an example of great teaching, I'll eat my hat!Awful film.",Bad Teacher
11,michaelRokeefe,Hot for teacher!,7,26 October 2011,"Raunchy comedy. Elizabeth Halsey(Cameron Diaz)is a reluctant middle school teacher, who gets dumped by her wealthy boyfriend. The blatant gold digger now must rely on teaching middle school. Miss Halsey is foul mouthed and a definite looker; and she desperately wants to save money for breast-implant surgery(as if she really needs it). Miss Squirrel(Lucy Punch)is a two-faced co-teacher and the complete opposite of Elizabeth. Russell Gettis(Jason Segel)is a gym teacher that to Miss Halsey is...well, just a gym teacher. When Scott Delacorte(Justin Timberlake)arrives as the new substitute teacher and is obviously well healed, the bad teacher Elizabeth tries to get close to his wallet. Miss Halsey tries to earn a big bonus by having her class score the highest on the Illinois state exam. She gets partially clad to help her class with the annual car wash in hopes of pocketing some more cash for her expensive breast implants. Miss Squirrel doesn't like the fact that the hot Elizabeth is moving in on her boyfriend...the handsome Delacorte. She starts a campaign to get the bad teacher fired. Some big laughs, most induced by raw language. Diaz is hilarious and so damn easy to watch. This is one movie I don't recall seeing her in what seems her obligatory pantie prance scene. Although the car wash sequence will suffice. Also in the cast: Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins, Jillian Armenante and Katherine Newton.",Bad Teacher
12,hitchcockthelegend,Teaching how to make comedy films badly.,4,7 April 2012,"Bad Teacher is directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. It stars Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch and Jason Segel. It's a solid premise to work from, it features an audacious and sexy turn from Diaz, while Punch steals the movie from her more illustrious co-stars. Yet Bad Teacher never achieves all that it can as a comedy. It starts off promisingly as Diaz's money grabbing teacher (Elizabeth Halsey) proves to be one big bluffing babe. She drinks, smokes pot, acerbically talks down to her students and does as little work as possible. This is funny stuff, for about 15 minutes, then the joke quickly wears thin. It's then that it dawns on you that the trailer, with it's brief running time and condensing of the premise, is the best thing about Bad Teacher.But wait! There's a hook, a new addition to the teaching ranks turns her head, the not harsh on the eye Scott Delacorte (Timberlake) is maybe her way to wealth and lazy happiness. Only he likes breasts and poor Elizabeth isn't well flushed in that department, perhaps she can get hers enlarged? If only she could afford the procedure! Wait! (again) There's a financial bonus given to the teacher with the highest results in the state, can Elizabeth reform and spur her class on to greatness whilst snagging the twee Delacorte? Can she win the vicious personal battle with scholastic rival, and major achiever, Amy Squirrel? (Punch) Do we care? No not really, unless you find dry humping the pinnacle of comedy?There's also the nagging doubt surrounding the confused messages once it's all mercifully over. I mean the bitch wins here. The shallow self centred charisma free Halsey actually triumphs when really she doesn't deserve to. Has she got the viewers to root for her? Well you would hope not since she's cruel and a bit of a moany hole, with Diaz not done any favours by a weak script full of empty spaces where character development should be. It seems that Kasdan thought that dressing up a superficial character in pretty Cameron Diaz clobber was going to be enough to see his film across the winning line. It wasn't and quite frankly Bad Teacher should go to the back of the class and stay there. 4/10 for the efforts of Punch and the underused Segel.",Bad Teacher
13,zardoz-13,Easy F,1,26 June 2011,"Talk about a waste of time and talent! ""Walk Hard"" director Jake Kasdan has fashioned a predictable, 89-minute, R-rated comedy that takes few risks and breaks no new ground. The pathetic, lowest-common-denominator humor struggles to qualify as raunchy, but it all looks like bits and pieces that wound up on the cutting room floor for the hilarious Billy Bob Thornton epic ""Bad Santa."" No, nobody who worked on ""Bad Santa"" had anything to do with this uninspired, low-life laffer boasting consistently obnoxious characters. Sure, our blond, bombshell heroine spouts profanity, smokes marijuana, and has promiscuous sex with single guys. So what! Most of this borderline bad behavior that would appeal to underage urchins giggling gleefully as they inhale their first puffs from a cigarette butt and ogle a Maxim magazine. ""Bad Teacher"" isn't 'bad' based on what the characters do. Now, had our heroine had gone to bed with one of her seventh graders, indulged in sex with either another woman or a midget, and manufactured meth, then she would have emerged as a 'bad' teacher. The son of writer & director Lawrence Kasdan who made ""The Big Chill,"" ""Wyatt Earp,"" and ""Silverado,"" Jake Kasdan has only helmed one memorable film, the crudely subversive musical-comedy spoof ""Walk Hard."" Everything else that he has made ranks at best as fair to middling fare. The only thing worth looking at in ""Bad Teacher"" is Cameron Diaz. Indeed, the 38-year old actress looks sexy when she sponges down cars with her body, slinks around in skimpy outfits like a tramp, and swears like a sailor, but ""Bad Teacher"" cannot compare with something really funny like the Farrelly Brothers' comedy ""There's Something about Mary."" ""Bad Teacher"" is neither as entertaining as her earlier sci-fi outing ""The Box"" or the melodramatic ""My Sister's Keeper.""The bare-bones plot concerns an Illinois middle-school teacher, Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), who wouldn't last thirty seconds in an actual class room. Elizabeth is an abrasive, self-centered, gold-digger. She had been planning to marry a wealthy guy, Mark (Nat Faxon of ""Beerfest"") until his protective mother convinces him that Elizabeth only wants his loot. She accuses Elizabeth of being so oblivious to her son that she does not even know when Mark's birthday is. Distraught over this debacle, our heroine heads back to the class room. Earlier, her colleagues had given Elizabeth a big-send off with a Boston Market gift card. When she is in the class room, Elizabeth's ideas about pedagogy consist primarily of showing her students movies on DVD such as ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""Dangerous Minds,"" and ""Lean on Me."" Meantime, Elizabeth sits at her desk and either sleeps or looks at breast implant literature! She doesn't particularly like the hopelessly chipper teacher across the hall, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch of ""Dinner for Schmucks""), because Amy lives and breathes to teach middle school. Indeed, Amy is somewhat anal about following rules! Indeed, Amy is appalled that Elizabeth is relying on DVDs this early in the semester.No sooner has the semester started than the school acquires a new teacher, Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake of ""Get Smart""), who Elizabeth stoops to conquer, except that she has to tangle with cheerful Amy to land him. Marking time in the wings for Elizabeth is the only remotely sympathetic character, middle school gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), who doesn't get her attention until the last quarter-hour of the action. Actually, the amiable Russell shares more in common with Elizabeth than any of her other colleagues. Russell puffs pot and displays a cynicism that reflects Elizabeth's own. Anyhow, our calculating heroine figures that the only way that she can get Scott is to have her breasts enlarged. Talk about cynicism! A scene with a plastic surgeon, Doctor Vogel (David Paymer of ""Redbelt"") and one of his boob job models at his clinic is about as sleazy as this saga gets. Elizabeth drools at the sight of those big knockers and fantasizes about the possibilities that they offer. Imagine her distress when she winds up in bed with Scott and all they do is dry-hump, and then we are shown an obvious semen stain on his jeans. Anybody who grimaces at this behavior has clearly led a cloistered life where sleazy movies are concerned. After our heroine gets the idea to orchestrate a car wash where she uses her body as a sponge to wash the vehicles and then pockets the proceeds, Elizabeth drums up the balance of her bread for a breast job by stealing the answers to a Standardized test. Elizabeth puts on a red ""Annie"" wig, masquerades as a journalist, and seduces a timid educator, Carl Halabi (Thomas Lennon of ""Reno 911: Miami""), and then slips a roofie in his drink. Again, as thoroughly objectionable and unethical as her behavior is, it is nothing new in a movie. Had Elizabeth found herself opposite a lusty lesbian educator, then that might have been a little closer to the borderline. Nothing that Elizabeth does amounts to a challenge her to her skills or her taste. Surprisingly, Timberlake plays his preppy, be-spectacled school teacher as if he were a closeted homosexual. Of course, Cameron Diaz is largely trading on her spectacular looks, but even she is looks a little bewildered playing such an inadequately drawn character. You don't really hate her and you don't really admire her. Nobody takes advantage of her and Diaz never musters any charisma as a 'bad' girl. If you are looking for something like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Mr. Woodcock,"" or ""School of Rock,"" you won't find it in ""Bad Teacher."" Altogether, ""Bad Teacher"" is not bad, mostly tame. This amoral lesson in life deserves a grade of F for forgettable!",Bad Teacher

Off-putting, slatternly Diaz (never better with her comic chops and full-game here) faces uncertainty after being dumped by her rich fiancé and forced to return to her teaching gig but finds a possible way out in the unlikely goal of saving money for new breasts to woo over dorky new substitute teech (JT ably deconstructing his 'sexy back' image) despite goody-goody colleague Punch (who nearly steals the film) from gumming up the works. While director Jake Kasdan keeps things lively (including a laugh-out-loud seduction sequence involving dweeb testing administrating rep Lennon) the f-bomb dropping screenplay by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisneberg is hit-and-miss and frankly could have been even dirtier/nastier and funnier.

16,neil-476,"Fun, but...",7,24 June 2011,"You know exactly what you're getting with Bad Teacher - you're getting Cameron Diaz as a bad teacher Elizabeth. In her private life she is looking to hook a rich husband for his money: she smokes, drinks, takes drugs, swears a vast amount and sleeps around. As a teacher she does all that stuff, too: she is also a slacker, can't be bothered to remember her students' names, steals, abuses the kids... The list goes on and on. There is a plot of sorts, which involves Elizabeth trying to get money through fair means or foul (mostly foul) for a boob job in order to hook rich substitute teacher Justin Timberlake, and the efforts of by-the-book but irritating teacher Amy (Lucy Punch) to foil her, but the title pretty much says it all.I must confess to enjoying it. A lot of it is pretty funny, Cameron Diaz clearly has a ball and is both funny and sexy (the car wash sequence is both at the same time), and Lucy Punch also does well with a character who spirals into mania as she fails to be able to do something about what she, and she alone, sees happening (I particularly liked the references to an unexplained incident in her past). So I was entertained throughout.Now to reservations. One is the fact that the central character is sociopathic - her every action is driven by ""What's in it for me?"" It's not so much that she gets away with it - that happens in real life all the time, and it's not exactly unknown in movies either. It's more that the final sequences promises some sort of redemption, and that simply doesn't happen in real life. Oh well, perhaps I'm just reading too much into it. It is a comedy, after all.And two is that, with the exception of Jason Segel's gym teacher, not a single one of the adult characters behaves remotely believably at any point in the movie, which makes suspension of disbelief a difficult trick to pull off.",Bad Teacher
17,anaconda-40658,Bad Teacher. Good Film.,7,9 July 2015,"Bad Teacher (2011): Dir: Jake Kasdan / Cast: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith: She is indeed, bad. She sleeps during class while the students are watching movies. She grades tests using profane vocabulary. To top it off she uses a student car wash to raise money for a boob job. She is played with great flair by Cameron Diaz and the film opens with her leaving teaching to settle down in married life only to be dumped by her fiancée whose mother sees through her greedy intentions. She returns to teaching the following year and sets her sights on a new teacher, played by Justin Timberlake but his affections are being competed for by the uptight Miss Squirrel, played by Lucy Punch. Director Jake Kasdan made the music mockumentary masterpiece Walk Hard: A Dewey Cox Story. He doesn't match that greatness here but he does create a fantastic stage for the comic talents of Diaz who is merciless in her quest for success. She will manipulate and scam until luck favors her. Jason Segel as the gym teacher whom she ignores is well played but flat. Timberlake is quite different as the nerdy teacher unsmittened with Diaz. He will learn a lesson or two that will leave him with no romantic resources. Punch steals her scenes as she competes with Diaz and seemingly wins until her quests for sabotage backfires. Phyllis Smith plays another teacher who befriends Diaz but she cannot steal scenes here the way that Punch seems able to.

I can't recall laughing once, which confused me for a second as director Jake Kasdan has had a lot of great credits to his name in the past, but than I realized that both writers for this swill were involved in the ""year One"" travesty and It all clicked into place.

20,Wuchakk,Every school has at least one,7,6 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Jake Kasdan, ""Bad Teacher"" is a dramedy about a slothful, inept middle school teacher in Illinois (Cameron Diaz) who hates her work, her pupils and her colleagues. She has no choice but to return to teaching after losing her sugar daddy and aspires to the lofty goal of getting breast implants. Lucy Punch plays her winsome rival while Justin Timberlake appears as a wealthy eligible teacher. Jason Segel plays the gym teacher who's interested in her while Phyllis Smith appears as her aged, overweight teacher pal. Do you remember the bad teacher at your school? Every school has at least one, usually more. I found ""Bad Teacher"" amusing from beginning to end and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. It helps that the characters are all well-defined & cast and that the story is absorbing. The soundtrack features some quality snippets by the likes of Judas Priest (""You've God Another Thing Coming"" & ""The Ripper""), Whitesnake (""Still of the Night"") and Dio (""Rainbow in the Dark"").NOTE: I saw the censored version, not the unrated one, which is likely gross.

Before I even thought about this movie after seeing it, I went and watched Bad Santa for the first time. Both films have a similar premise with the lead character being unpleasant and offensive. But Bad Santa was written with a more style of dark comedy, and let's not forget, with a corrupt childhood and a ""whatever"" attitude, Billy Bob Thornton's character had a perfectly good reason to be ""bad"" and mean. Cameron Diaz has none other than she is just mean-spirited and has chosen to pursue a miserable lifestyle.Elizabeth Halsey is our main character, portrayed by the lovely Cameron Diaz. Elizabeth is a teacher had a normal school, and comes home one day to her fiancée and finds out that his mother has convinced him to call of the wedding. Planning to possibly spend the rest of her life staying at home since her fiancée was rich, Elizabeth must return to the school where she shows her class movies every day while she naps at her desk.Seeing the attractive substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Timberlake), Elizabeth makes conversation to learn he has just gone through a breakup with a woman with large breasts. Elizabeth decides to under-go a breast enlargement surgery, a costly but rewarding surgery, to be more self-appreciative.The main rival in the film is Amy Squirrel (Punch), another teacher in the building. She believes that Elizabeth is a fraud, scamming the school out of money (to pay for her surgery). There is also a strange attraction between Jason Segel's character as the gym teacher. The movie's biggest fault is it focuses more on Elizabeth's sometimes funny, sometimes not antics instead of building up the attraction it should with Jason Segel's character. When the film ends, we feel that the film itself didn't know how to end and just thought up something out of the blue just to give the film some sort of sun-shiny ending. The end would've been better, if we got more of a relationship between the two.Another problem is that the students are never developed enough. The film has several students that speak to Miss Halsey individually, but it seems it can't make up its mind which one it wants to focus on. We have the brown nose girl and the sensitive kid who writes poetry and is crushing on the girl way out of his league. We get brief scenes with them, but we never see Elizabeth talk to one of the students very much. In Bad Santa, Thornton was always talking to kids and, despite his sour motivation, he was optimistic about the loner he picked up along the way.The backstory isn't big either. If Cameron Diaz is such a miserable hack behind the desk, why did she take up teaching in the first place? How did she become a teacher? Does the principal never come in the classroom to find that Elizabeth is sleeping while the kids watch Scream? While I liked Diaz in There's Something About Mary and other things she has done, in this, she is just barely likable.The jokes are funny. But boy does the writing fail it. When the jokes are funny, they are really funny. When the jokes fail, they fall flat on their face and are cringe inducing. The dry humping scene between Diaz and Timberlake is awkward, and is useless. It doesn't cause any advance in the plot or accomplishment among Diaz's part. It's simply there to have some sort of sex scene in a movie titled Bad Teacher.Bad Teacher is cute, but ultimately not as dirty or as funny as it should be. The relationship between the characters is forced, no one on screen seems to be doing their best, and the screenplay, like I said, can be good but can really bad. A comedy that had potential, also had a really good movie it would be compared to for its lifetime. The result; Santa will live on while the Teacher will need an attitude adjustment.Starring: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, and Justin Timberlake. Directed by: Jake Kasdan.",Bad Teacher
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,More like Bad Movie,3,28 October 2011,"I love dark comedies, it seems like sometimes to be an audience pleaser we are given more light hearted comedies that never push the edge. Bad Teacher looked like it was going to give that proper push that you could just let go for an hour and a half and have a good time. We had a movie a few years ago called Bad Santa, that had virtually the same premise where Santa is supposed to be good and jolly but instead we have a slob scum bag who later realizes there is more to being a good guy. The comedy worked very well and had actors who fit the roles perfectly. Bad Teacher is about a woman who is a gold digger and is embezzling money from her school charities to enhance her breast size to get a wealthy teacher, great idea, bad actors. Something about this film just didn't work and it's between the cop out with the story or the actors, tough call.Elizabeth is a gold digging school teacher who curses at her students, drinks heavily, smokes marijuana, and only shows movies while she sleeps through class. She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fiancé, but when he dumps her, she must resume her job as a teacher. She tries to win over substitute teacher Scott, who is also wealthy. Elizabeth plans to get surgery to get breast implants, believing that she needs them since Scott's ex girlfriends have larger breasts. However, she cannot afford the $10,000 procedure. Amy, her teaching nemeses sees all that Elizabeth is doing and plans to catch her to expose her to the principal and get her fired.Cameron Diaz, I'm still confused on why she is such a hot commodity in Hollywood. Don't get me wrong, I do like the girl, but not enough to see her carry a film. Her comedy seems a little forced at times with the lead character, you can always tell that she's acting. I don't think the role fit her too well. Justin Timberlake, when will the boy release another album? Probably when he stops choosing crap roles. I actually do like him as an actor, he's one of the rare artists who can pull off both talents. But this was the one time where he was pretty much a fail because his character is so bland. Jason Segal, again a likable actor who has great comedic timing, but for some reason to me he seemed disinterested in the movie and I think it's because he knew it was a silly script. There's a scene where he's arguing with a student over Michael Jordon still being the best basketball player and the kid questions his response and he screams ""That's the only argument I need Shawn!"", so shouting this at a 12 year old is funny? I found it more pathetic.I'm not trying to sound like a whiner with this movie, because there are a few chuckles here and there. I thought the idea for the story is actually hilarious and should be given another chance. I think they just tried to make this too audience friendly because having the main character as the ultimate jerk through the whole movie and then to have her randomly pull the lamest sympathy vote at the end not even explaining why she is the way she is not clever and was a cop out in my opinion. Most of the laughs are cheap and I didn't like the ending. It's a lousy movie that had so much more potential. I watched this with my boyfriend on pay per view, he had to leave the last few minutes of the film, when he came back I told him we had it all day if he wanted to finish and he said that he wasn't getting into it and THAT'S THE ONLY ARGUMENT I NEED TO SAY THIS IS AN AWFUL MOVIE.3/10",Bad Teacher
24,DKosty123,Diaz Beats A Lazer Wash On A Hot Day,7,26 December 2011,"I waited for the DVD on this one and have only watched the ""UnRated"" version. While this movie is definitely not for the kiddies, it is a funny film with spots of irony in the plot. I am sure on a nice sunny day that Diaz not only beats the Lazer Wash, but gets the car drier better too. My car never gets really dry at the Lazer.Diaz plays a movie suitably bad teacher(Ms. Halsey). While she is not as scary as the real ones who make the news, she is indeed a bad teacher. It starts showing her gold digging days, but she is not a smart gold digger. She lets her rich boyfriend know how bad she is spending his dough before the pre-nup.Meanwhile, she has just finished her first year of teaching, and when the relationship breaks, she has to return for another round at school. The second year does not start any better, but then as she settles in more it gets even worse. That is because her co-workers get to know her better than year one, and find out she really is bad, especially Ms. Punch who plays the obsessed Amy Squirrel to a tee. It doesn't hurt that Ms. Squirrel and Ms. Halsey are both after the same teacher Scott (Timberlake). After losing the rich boyfriend, Halsey decides she needs to get $10,000 to build really big breasts on her frame in order to get another rich boyfriend. Halsey is not in touch with reality here as her breasts were not the problem with the first break up. There are some moments in the film where Halsey actually helps some of her students in this version. The film has quite a few funny moments and follows a plot through. I've seen much worse Comedy efforts than this one. I will not spoil it but the ending is more to my liking than I thought it would be. In spite of Diaz washing my car, for some reason I want to make it with a squirrel. Maybe I'd better say that so you know where I am coming from.",Bad Teacher
25,KineticSeoul,"Far from being a great comedy, but got a few chuckles out of it",5,7 July 2011,"This is a summer movie that I heard positive things about from people, so I was expecting a pretty darn good comedy. But that just wasn't really the case, most of the laugh just comes from how much of a bitch a person can be and it wasn't all that funny. I don't know if I said this in the past review that featured Cameron Diaz but she is getting old and she ain't none of those top class actresses over 40. So I guess she was desperate or something but I personally found it more nauseating than sexy and the audiences reactions in the theater was basically the same. Although I think she is having a midlife crisis cause she seemed to try to be sexy a bit too much while the characters in the movie constantly fall for her. Maybe that was why she took this role to try and prove to the world that she is still attractive. Actually I noticed this with a lot of aging female celebs, they always seem a bit too hard with the sex appeal when they reach mid 30's. Which might be sort of understandable because of how the music industry work and when you lose that popularity your just about finished. I don't know but she just seemed a bit too desperate. If it was Anna Faris who was in the trailer for ""What's Your Number?"" before it started it might have seemed a bit different. Lucy Punch was pretty good as the psycho teacher but than again she sort of reminded me of teachers with similar character traits in the past so it was a bit nostalgic. Jason Segel is alright as the P.E. Teacher and Justin Timberlake managed to fit the role but there is plenty of actors that could have pulled off that role. This movie also didn't want to force a moral, but the moral of this movie is terrible.5.9/10",Bad Teacher
26,Hellmant,'BAD TEACHER' is an OK movie.,6,4 August 2011,"'BAD TEACHER': Three Stars (Out of Five) Cameron Diaz stars in this raunchy dark satire, continuing the popular trend of female powered vulgar R rated comedies. She plays an uninspired and useless Chicago junior high teacher who treats her students like annoying stepping stones to her dream life. The movie is obviously a jab at tenure but is mostly just a light hearted dark comedy rather than any kind of political commentary. Jake Kasdan directed the film and Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg wrote it. It's not the best example of it's genre but it could have been a lot worse, definitely not a bad way to spend your time.Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher with no passion for teaching who drinks a lot, gets stoned a lot and swears a lot (in front of her students). She's always planned on marrying rich and leaving the working life behind and as the movie opens she's all set to do that. Then her fiancé's mother catches on to her scheming ways and talks her son in to calling off the wedding. Halsey despairingly returns to work and sets her eyes on a new rich sub (Justin Timberlake) but realizes in order to impress him she's going to need a boob job. So she plots one despicable scam after another ripping her school off of money in order to pay for the expensive operation. She faces competition from a fellow teacher (brilliantly portrayed by Lucy Punch) and also has to deal with the unwanted affection of the gym teacher (Jason Segel).The movie is most importantly funny, it might not have any huge laughs but the jokes for the most part work. Thanks in large part to a nearly flawless cast. Punch is the scene stealer but Diaz holds her own, Segel is convincingly cool and witty and Timberlake is adequate (at least he's been sticking to roles he can pull off lately). There's also nice supporting turns from John Michael Higgins and Phyllis Smith (from TV's 'THE OFFICE'). Kasdan's directing is fitting to the material and I can see why the screenplay attracted the cast it did. It's got heart here and there but the lead character is definitely too unlikeable to ever really care about and what she gets away with in the film is kind of sickening. It is a dark comedy but it would have been nice to have someone to root for (besides Segel, who's part is way too small).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A",Bad Teacher

Cameron, whom I've appreciated since her debut in The Mask, did an excellent job of showing that side of dark and selfish, yet actually human. Her character actually took what most people think, whether they admit it or not, out of the mind and into action. She actually did a bang up job, including some, albeit rare, bouts of humanity. I also enjoyed Jason Segel's character and Jason's wit throughout. Sure, overall, she is a ""bad teacher"" and not recommended to stand (or bend) in front of any student or human, but it's a fun little ride when you leave your brain at the door.",Bad Teacher
28,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"For a film about education, this is really the dumbest thing you'll ever see",2,17 April 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Cameron Diaz stars as Liz Halsey, the worst teacher in the world, who sets the worst example to her students you can imagine.

While the 'bad' idea worked well in recent efforts (Bad Santa) the concept here just fails to materialize and is just dumb. And, most killingly of all, not funny. It's unbelievable someone as stupid and irresponsible as Halsey would even be a teacher in the first place, and from this small acorn the whole forest crumbles. By the end, this flimsy concept has been stretched to breaking point and, after just a few minor laughs, it's shattered you to pieces. *",Bad Teacher

This one actually is. Okay, so it doesn't offer anything particularly original and it is a bit vulgar at times (even I was shocked by the language - without the few four letter words, it could have been cut down to a 12 certificate!), but it's just fun - fun, fun, fun. Daft, silly, frivolous and perfect to unwind to.Like most people, you're probably used to seeing Cameron Diaz as a nice girl-next-door type.

This reminded much of Bad Santa in the way of how we get to see that the usual normally good people can have bad people too. Despite some crude and offensive jokes, I found this movie to be quite hilarious. I didn't expect much from the trailers so I was pleasantly surprised when I reached the end of the movie.This film is about a teacher with really bad manners who is desperate for a breast job. She then goes all out against a rival teacher to do all she can to win the bonus even if it means breaking the law.Cameron Diaz isn't that bad actually. She does seem to have a gift for comedy. She still looks hot but we can see she's getting older. Jason Segel as always is good and heartwarming in his role. I loved Lucy Punch as the rival teacher. I didn't care much for Justin Timberlake. I thought his character was stupid and did not belong in the movie.Overall, this is a funny movie even if it tries to break barriers. It relies on the charisma of the actors to succeed which it mostly does. I loved the car wash scene because I thought it was kind of sexy. Easily the scene in the movie. I did think this movie had problems with the flow of the plot and some unexplained things plot-wise but in the end, it doesn't matter much. I rate this film 8/10.",Bad Teacher

34,atlasmb,Why Laugh At A Bad Teacher?,6,13 September 2020,"""Selfishness"" can mean the rational self-interest that people need to survive. Or it can mean, conversely, the total absence of interest in anyone but oneself as personified by Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), the titular bad teacher of this film. Miss Halsey doesn't just teach her students badly, she refuses to teach them at all, because she has no interest in teaching, which could only be boring. You'd have to be a sucker to do something you don't enjoy in Miss Halsey's world.If you have seen the series ""A. P. Bio"", you know it is about a former Harvard philosophy professor who is assigned to teach biology to a high school class. Jack sees the job as beneath him, so he is disinterested in the class---until he realizes he can use the students to exact revenge on a perceived enemy. But, unlike Miss Halsey, he eventually comes to appreciate his students to some degree.Miss Halsey is not just bad at teaching; she is a bad example, morally. In the course of the film, we see her break rules and laws, and model the worst possible behavior. When she learns there is a substantial prize for the teacher whose students perform the best on a standardized test, she buckles down and---driven by self-interest alone---becomes a tyrannical teacher bent on winning. At this moment, the viewer thinks a moral may be coming, that Miss Halsey may, through her new efforts, find purpose and reward in actually teaching. But no. Instead she undertakes a dangerous mission to obtain the answers to the standardized exam. In the end she is not redeemed, and she wins the prize.That's an interesting plot choice, but I would argue that it would be a better film if a) she didn't cheat and her students performed well just because of her honest efforts or b) she didn't cheat and the student's scores fell short of winning the prize, but she learned a lesson about the value of hard work or c) she came to actually like some of her students when she got to know them and became vested in their well being.But no. Miss Halsey never learns a lesson about morality or virtue in the film. But she does learn that breast inserts are not a panacea. And that the best boyfriends don't always come in the prettiest packages. But no, she never really grows in the most substantial ways.But I still enjoyed watching this film. I call that a ""guilty pleasure"". Why is it still enjoyable, despite its questionable choices? For one thing, the film sets up an existential battle between Miss Halsey, who represents bad impulses, and Miss Squirrel (wonderfully performed by Lucy Punch), who represents something worse---the priggish puritan who seeks to perform well solely as a way of public preening. When these two do battle, it is Miss Halsey who carries our wishes for victory.The film also has wonderful characterizations by Phyllis Smith and Justin Timberlake, in particular. Smith plays Miss Davies, an unsophisticated teacher who is somewhat lured by Miss Halsey's freewheeling lifestyle. Timberlake plays teacher Scott Delacorte, an innocent square easily manipulated by Miss Squirrel. His acting against type is one of the best aspects of the film,Though he is no genius, gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) can run rings around Scott Delacorte intellectually. And Miss Halsey eventually understands she has more in common with Russell.You don't really need to justify enjoying a guilty pleasure, but the film does offer some funny and clever moments. And Cameron Diaz can get the most out of a scene that requires bawdiness or elements of grossness. So feel free to enjoy the antics of a bad teacher. Just don't let your young kids watch it.",Bad Teacher
35,tabuno,Unredeeming,5,14 January 2019,"17 April 2015. If one can stand an un-redeeming, mostly unlikeable character than perhaps this movie may be tolerable. Unfortunately, Cameron Diaz's character is so selfish, egoistic, conniving that unless you are either a narcissist or antisocial psychopath it's unlikely that you will like this movie. Most people would be better off watching Jack Black in The School of Rock (2003). Almost the whole movie shows Cameron as a lazy, disinterested teacher who only cares about getting in the pants of anyone who can help her find a sugar daddy. Only rarely do we see her care about someone else and its pretty juvenile. So unless one has a temperament of an immature teenage adolescent, this movie isn't for you.",Bad Teacher
36,The-Sarkologist,I so wish I had a teacher like this one at high school,7,24 December 2011,"This is one of those films that when you see the advertisement you think that it really isn't going to be all that much, but when you watch it it turns out to be pretty entertaining. The plot and theme are pretty simple, but I guess the appeal about this movie is the question as to how such a rude, crude, and pretty much uncaring person actually becomes a teacher let alone survives at one.The movie opens with Miss Halsey (Diaz) finishing up after a year of teaching where she pretty much tried to do as little as possible and interact as little as possible with the people around her. However, when her dream husband, namely a guy with a lot of money that she could sponge off the rest of her life, dumps her just before the wedding, horror upon horror, she suddenly discovers that not only is she single, but she has to work for a living.Thus when she returns to the school for the next year she decides that he goal in life is to marry a man with lots of money so that she doesn't have to go back to school. Once again, I ask the question how could such a person actually become a teacher, however we must remember that this is Hollywood, and a lot of times Hollywood really does not make much sense. Miss Halsey spends her nights roaming singles bars looking for wealthy men, and then spends the day sleeping in class while showing her class movies.This of course upsets the teacher that teaches across the hall from her, Miss Squirrel. Miss Squirrel is the do-gooder to starts of attempting to befriend Miss Halsey, however this quickly turns sour when Miss Halsey makes it very clear that she doesn't want friends at the school. Same when the Gym Teacher, Mr Gettis (Seigal), attempts to ask her out on a date. She pretty much tells him to get lost. Then the substitute teacher, Mr Delacourt (Timberlake) turns up. Not only does Miss Halsey find him cute, but also discovers that he is the heir to a family fortune. The catch is that Miss Squirrel is also very interested in him as well.There are a couple of inconsistencies in this film, and also it pretty much runs like a romantic comedy, however the comedy is a lot more low brow, and in a way, in the gutter, which is probably why I liked this film. I find it also odd that it turns out that at least two of the teachers at the school are smoking marijuana (Miss Halsey, surprise, surprise, is one of them, but then there are all the other drugs that she keeps in her desk as well).Much of the movie is about how Miss Halsey is attempting to find $10 000 for breast enhancement surgery, and how she believes that by making herself even more beautiful that she will be able to attract the man of her dreams, which happens to be Mr Delacourt. It, in a way, goes to show how shallow and empty people are, though as is expected in a film like this, Miss Halsey ends up getting the guy that she should have got in the beginning. So, yes, this is not so much a movie where the girl chases the guy that she wants, and gets him, but chases the guy that she wants, only to discover that he is not actually the guy that she really wants, but rather turns out to be the other guy, the one that likes her, no matter the size of her breasts.",Bad Teacher

All in all, a bad comedy that doesn't entertain or keep the interest till the end.",Bad Teacher
40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Diaz is a fitting bad girl in this clever albeit completely illogical comedy,6,14 November 2011,"She might have been a rom-com darling for most of her career, but there's no mistaking now that Cameron Diaz is a natural bad girl. Sure, part of it might have to do with survival of the fittest; raunchy R-rated comedies are the new cool kid in class and those who can't play that game will find themselves jobless. But Diaz might have even upped her stock with her performance in ""Bad Teacher,"" a movie that's unapologetically crude if not to the fault of absurdity. Nevertheless, foul-mouthed middle school teacher Elizabeth Halsey makes for an amusing character study (no worries, you can skate by on the cliff notes).Writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky have essentially taken the laundry list of what qualities constitute a good teacher and ensured that Elizabeth embodies or does the opposite. To top it off (no pun intended), her motivation throughout the entire film is to raise enough money to afford breast implants, or as her character would be more apt to say, ""a new pair of t***,"" so that she might be able to woo the attractive and wealthy new substitute (Justin Timberlake). Entire films have been built from shallower foundations, but for those bothered by issues of plausibility, ""Bad Teacher"" will be offensive in more ways than the many it already intended. How someone of Elizabeth's nature ever got a teaching position in the first place will be the one question that crosses the mind of every viewer at some point during the film. Once you get past that whole in logic, it becomes easier to appreciate the way ""Bad Teacher"" allows us a chance to imagine what the world's worst teacher would be like.Elizabeth is about to finish her first (and only) year at John Adams Middle School somewhere in Illinois and wed the ""man of her dreams"" only he and his mother are on to the fact that she only wants him for the money. Her plan having failed, she returns to ""JAMS"" as a means of keeping herself (and her poor lifestyle) afloat. Her return reignites the gym teacher's (Jason Segel) advances and a rivalry with her polar opposite, the spunky learning-lover Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Other than Diaz, Punch is the only one who seems aware of how absurd the film is and consequently she pushes it further with her delightfully quirky performance.The depths to which both Elizabeth and Amy will stoop to get what they want or ruin the other have no limit. Their schemes are cleverly concocted, though they're along the lines of your typical high jinks. Putting aside that their entire story relies on an unusually large suspension of disbelief, Eisenberg and Stupnitsky show a knack for writing easily digested crowd-pleasers. The array of other supporting characters could be described as either run-of-the-mill or perfectly adequate. Timberlake makes few waves as a socially oblivious dork who as it turns out has a passion for dry-humping and John Michael Higgins delivers exactly what's expected of him: acting like John Michael Higgins. Phyllis Smith brings her ""The Office"" character over to this film with a measure of success, but only those unfamiliar with her will be impressed.The small ounce of a ""good message"" comes with a slight lowering of Elizabeth's superficial expectations after her grand plan unfurls. The natural thought here would be to completely ignore any sort of moral responsibility to end on a warm and fuzzy note considering all previous material dismisses it anyway. Yet some sort of Hollywood obligation must have nagged for awhile. Forget Elizabeth, the fact that Segel's character Russell would want anything to do with her beginning, middle or end of the film says a lot (though quite little) about his character.The R-rated comedy trend continues to thrive with ""Bad Teacher,"" though for better or worse it's hard to say. Calling it a guilty pleasure comedy might be the most apt description, as even those who really enjoy it will admit just where it falls on the preposterous spectrum. Considering many previous Cameron Diaz vehicles have fallen into the guilty pleasure category too, maybe the actress has been in her comfort zone all along.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com",Bad Teacher

42,lisafordeay,Saw this on Channel Four last night not bad,5,6 January 2014,"Bad Teacher is about a good for nothing teacher named Elizabeth played by Cameron Diaz who uses her job to earn money to get breast implants as well as only sitting at her desk showing her class a bunch of DVDs that aren't in relation to schoolwork. Problems arise however when she starts to fall for a teacher called Scott(played by Justin Timberlake)who Amy Squirrel(played by British Actress Lucy Punch who starred in Ella Enchanted back in 2004,while here she sports an American accent which was really good BTW)has a crush on and wants to do all in her power for Scott to be with her,but Elizabeth hates Amy and one point she frames her for drugs which Amy didn't use as Amy was looking for drugs in Elizabeth's desk.Later ANOTHER teacher has the hot's for Elizabeth played by Jason Segal from The Muppets and Elizabeth has to choose either Scott or Segal's character.Overall Bad Teacher wasn't a bad film and Cameron Diaz is a good actress,here she sorta reminded me of Michelle Phieffer as she's a lot older compare to her film debut The Mask back in 1994,but hey she can't help that can't she as she is in her 40s now.Overall its a 5.",Bad Teacher

Bridesmaids was a lot funnier, at least the jokes in that didn't come across like it was trying too hard.Liz(Cameron Diaz) a junior high school teacher, who does not want to be a teacher, but is because she has nothing else to go too. She shows her class movies, so she does not want to deal with them. Then a nerdy substitute teacher(Justin Timberlake) comes in the picture, who appears to have a lot of money, and Liz will do anything to land him, and does not care who she has to hurt.Cameron Diaz comes across like she trying to do Seth Rogen, but was not memorable, Cameron Diaz I think is a very talented versatile actress, but this was not her best work. I also hated the lack of creativity with the rest of the characters, Justin Timberlake is so null and void. I thought Diaz and Timberlake would have good chemistry,cause they used to date, but there scenes seemed awkward.

44,freemantle_uk,The voids of laugher speaks volumes,3,22 June 2011,"Bad Teacher had a strong premise for a comedy, a teacher is really bad and hates her job. It was marketed a raunchy hard-R comedy: sadly it was a film that was lacking, despite the best efforts of the actors.Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is the bad teacher in question who leaves the profession and forced to return when her fiancé dumps her for her gold digging ways. She returns to John Adams Middle High (JAMS) and sets out to win over Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a geeky substitute teacher who is the heir to a watch empire. He particularly likes women with big breasts and Elizabeth plans to get a boob job: but needs the money. But Scott himself is attached to Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), a quirky caring teacher who gets the best results in school. At the same time Elizabeth has a suitor in the form a Gym/P.E. teacher (Jason Seagel). When Elizabeth finds out the prize for the best school results in the Illinois State Test is a big cheque, she sets about to ensure her class is the best.The jokes were just lacking through the film. I was in a cinema that was 75% full and there were a lot of teachers in it and I can say with honesty that there was very little laugher, a few chuckles and no belly laughs. That says a lot about a comedy because the point is to make us laugh. I believe one of two things happened, either, that the film was originally going to be a PG-13 film and the producers thought that the film was more marketable as a R-rated comedy, or the more likely that it was cut much of the swearing out to get a PG-13 rating, and failed. Most of the use of the F word in the red band trailer was cut out from the actual film. They were also plot points, like when Elizabeth offered to tutor her students, goes nowhere. The pace throughout was just very slow and Bad Teacher needed more snap.Acting wise the best performance was Seagel best person the film, having the best lines with his role and the most grounded character in the film. He was simply natural as a gym teacher who just wants to have fun, though he has a dodgy line which makes him sound like a potential rapist. Punch is solid and she is deliberately over the top as a quirky teacher, but she does not have many good lines and Punch has to make the performance as physical as possible. She also gets very screwed over in the film. Diaz does her best but the character is not very well developed and her traits flipped like a switch. Most of the time she is shown as an uncaring person, only interested in herself and only got into teaching for the hours: but at the same time she does help some students and surely she should have cared as some point about teaching. She is also too ruthless, she needed to be a deeper character.I also have to comment about the actual school On Wikipedia it describes JAMS as a school in a poor area: it was certainly not, it was in a very middle class area. I liked how the kids in the school actually looked normal and not in cliques like the jocks, the nerds, the pretty girls, cheerleaders, etc They were mixed. But at the same time it seems like that the teachers only have one class: when I was in school the teachers had to teach classes over many years, if they only taught one class then they would have a very short working week.Overall, a big disappointment.",Bad Teacher

46,dee.reid,"A good ""Rotten Apple""",8,19 October 2011,"There will be those who watch Jake Kasdan's ""Bad Teacher"" and automatically think back to the cult classic Billy Bob Thornton-starring, Terry Zwigoff-directed comedy ""Bad Santa"" (2003) and think that the two movies are somewhat similar: Both pictures center around a drug-abusing, alcohol-swilling ""protagonist"" who doesn't give an ""F"" about anything but abusing drugs and swilling alcohol, yet somehow by the end of the story is forced to change their ways... just a little bit.""Bad Teacher"" is a rotten apple of a dark comedy about a Bad Teacher, Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), whose gold-digging ways are exposed by her fiancé at the beginning of the movie and left with little recourse, she is forced to return to her much-hated job as a middle school teacher at John Adams Middle School (JAMS). On her first day back, she makes the acquaintance of the geeky new substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), who also happens to be heir to a watch fortune; he also happens to like women with big boobs. So taking advantage of this fact to get him to become her new sugar daddy and concocting a scheme to get a $5700 bonus for getting the highest standardized test grades, she'll then use the money she earns from that to get breast implants. And she must also fend off the romantic advances of pot-smoking gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) and a caring goody-good rival named Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).This is not a bad film. Some thought ""Bad Santa"" would scare people because little kids would go into it thinking it was a new Christmas movie about Santa Claus (and we all know how well that turned out). Some of the humor is very dark and very crude (and sometimes forced), but I welcome it as a change to the usual run-of-the-mill ""light comedy"" being pushed upon us week after week. I laughed at many of the jokes here, and maybe some people have difficulty finding this sort of dark, crude humor funny. Some of the sub-plots involving a bullied unpopular kid and his crush on a pretty classmate are fairly underwhelming.On a more positive note, some of the characters are pretty colorful. Diaz is still looking great (I have to fake it here because I just can't get into blondes), but she relishes her role as a Bad Teacher with pill-popping, pot-smoking, alcohol-swilling pizazz. She shows up to work hung-over, and spends her nights hanging out at bars trying to hook up with any rich guy willing to take a chance with a gold-digging middle school teacher. I think it's a welcome change from her usual light-hearted comedic fare. In a nutshell, she gives the film's best performance.Surprisingly, Justin Timberlake, I think, continues to grow as a performer, especially after his well-received roles in past movies such as ""Alpha Dog"" (2006), and ""The Social Network"" (2010). While his work is not ""great"" here, it is at least showing that he is indeed capable of giving solid performances if given the right material. Phyllis Smith is also hilarious as their slightly neurotic fellow co-worker Lynn Davies. Segel probably gives the film's most grounded and realistic performance as the gym teacher who is only concerned with simply having fun, even though by his own admission he doesn't have a whole lot to have fun with.""Bad Teacher"" is a rotten apple that gets a ""B+"" for effort.8/10",Bad Teacher
47,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Bad Teacher,7,20 July 2019,7/10 - funny movie from the always charming Cameron Diaz,Bad Teacher
48,meeza,"I am not so hot for ""Bad Teacher"", even though it had its periods of laughter!",7,26 June 2011,"Buenos Diaz and welcome to my lecture, I mean review, of the Diaz-driven comedy ""Bad Teacher"". OK, I am not going to fire away on ""Bad Teacher"" but I am not going to give it cinematic tenure either. As mentioned, on the starring dais of ""Bad Teacher"" is the applelicious Cameron Diaz, who is not bad here, actually she was pretty good. Diaz stars as Elizabeth Halsey, a Middle School Teacher who craves to get a breast ahead of the golddigger sweepstakes by finding conniving ways to get money, so then she can get a boob job so she can marry rich. Halsey's Vomit and other unethical behaviors (showing movies in class, smoking pot, embezzling school fundraising money, etc) throughout her working school day make her a. see movie title. She catches the eye of Scott Delacorte, a substitute teacher whose parents are immensely wealthy due to their lucrative watch company. Therefore, like clockwork, Elizabeth has her new victim to somehow marry rich in the future. Justin Timberlake was in sync playing the dorky Delacorte, and was hilarious in a school dance scene. Ms. Halsey's rival is fellow teacher Ms. Squirrel solidly portrayed by the up-and-coming Lucy Punch. This Squirrel teeths into Halsey's mischievous ways; and Ms. Squirrel's unorthodox, corny-pun teaching methods might just be as horrific as Ms. Halsey's behaviors. But who am I to criticize corny puns, there are plenty of those already marked in this review. Two other performances that hit the B+ barometer in ""Bad Teacher"" were of John Michael Higgins who plays the dolphin- loving Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's only teacher- friend Ms. Davies. However, the thespian valedictorian of ""Bad Teacher"" is Jason Segel as P.E. Teacher Russell Gettis, whose repeated Gettisburg Address to get into Elizabeth's pants was quite entertaining. Segel is one of the brightest comedic actors of today, and everything he is in gets automatically bumped up a grade. So why don't I put ""Bad Teacher"" in the school of stellar comedies? Due to Director's Jake Kasdan orchestration of ""Bad Teacher"" in the last semester, I mean act of the movie. He was off to a great start with some outstanding opening sequences, but as the film went on it sure could have used some creative composition. Gene Stupnitzky & Lee Eisenberg's screenplay has its sporadic hilarious comedic lines within the dialogue, but needed a script tutor for its redundant narrative. I will pass ""Bad Teacher"" with a C+, mostly due to its drama team of actors. If you were able to read this pun-driven review, thank your preacher, because I bless you for having the courage. *** Average",Bad Teacher
49,GiraffeDoor,Not quite what I expected.,6,31 December 2019,"Cameron gets 90 minutes to prove that she can be more than the wholesome love interest.This unapologetic piece of edgelordism is actually rather refreshing in its celebration of...badness in a world where the goodie goodies win a bit too often.An adequate character arc of a self absorbed character learning to think a little bit less about herself while still not abandoning her identity while she bests the annoying one makes this just about watchable even if the gags are blunt, lazy, smug and mostly annoyingA lot of the familiar trashy humor is present.

But it has a strange, dark power.In terms of plot logistics the whole thing needs you to meet it half way but you get something of a grand gesture and at least an attempt at character development.",Bad Teacher
50,MBunge,Only proves how good Bad Santa was in the first place,4,29 June 2011,"What is wrong with people in Hollywood? I don't mean the drugs and the egomania and the somewhat questionable sexual practices. I mean how do people who make a living telling stories to human beings consistently show such poor understanding of the intersection of storytelling and human behavior? Bad Teacher is another in a long line of movies that feels like it was written by some COBOL-based computer program and filmed by the stand it for the robot from Short Circuit. It has no idea what makes characters interesting or how to present them to the audience in an engaging or sympathetic manner. All this thing does is cycle through a bunch of superficial stuff cribbed from other films while a few random jokes get shoved in with all the subtlety of a proctologist with that disease that turns your hands into lobster claws.Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is an inwardly grotesque and outwardly past-her-prime woman who gets dumped by her rich fiancée and is stuck teaching middle school. The plot parades through a series of situations we've all seen before, though with the twist of having them unfold from the perspective of the character who would normally be the villain. There's Elizabeth and the hapless wallflower co-worker, a feud with the sunny-faced teacher across the hall, the rich guy Elizabeth vainly pursues and the other guy that's obviously the one who's right for her. Throw in the old ""big test coming up that the students have to pass"" and an unfunny mixture of Bill Murray from Meatballs and Walter Matthau from The Bad News Bears and that's this motion picture.The obvious comparison of Bad Teacher is with Bad Santa. The comparison, unfortunately, is that the latter is an hilarious dark comedy and the former is prefabricated dreck that's about as funny as a tax audit. That's because the folks who made Bad Santa understand how people think and feel and respond. The makers of Bad Teacher understand people about as well as a Lyme disease-carrying tick.The stark distinction is nowhere clearer than between Billy Bob Thornton's Willie and Diaz' Elizabeth. Willie, the titular Bad Santa, is a catastrophically awful person. He's a degenerate alcoholic, consumed by self-loathing and possessing zero self-control, who is rude and mean to everyone in his vicinity. But what allows people to care what happens to Willie is that his problems are produced by his own dysfunction and as much misery as he inflicts on others, he attracts even more to himself. Willie is damaged, he knows he's damaged and the whole film is about Willie trying to escape the prison of his own flaws.Conversely, Elizabeth is a narcissistic bitch and that's all. She doesn't have any profound personal weaknesses. She does bad things to others without ever really suffering herself. She never truly acknowledges or repents of either her miserable personality or baser instincts. There's nothing about the character for the viewer to latch onto and nothing that would ever make anyone root for her. She starts and ends the movie as an utterly unlikable hag who still gets a happy ending, while Willie struggles to become a hero only to wind up in the hospital after being shot multiple times by the cops.That emotional and dramatic illogic extends through almost all of Bad Teacher. Take the main characters' love interests in both films. Willie is pursued by Sue (Lauren Graham), a Jewish girl with a Santa fetish. Elizabeth is pursued by Russell (Jason Segel), a gym teacher who has no reason to be interested in Elizabeth except to try and screw her. But while Willie welcomes Sue's advances, and any pathetic drunk would with a woman who looks like the smokin' hot Lauren Graham, Elizabeth is constantly rejecting Russell in frequently blunt and caustic fashion. Even though she has no attractive qualities other than being good looking, and Diaz stopped being insanely beautiful a few movies ago, Russell continues to throw himself at Elizabeth no matter how many terrible things she does to him or others. One of these relationships makes sense within the context of its story and is even charming in a rolling-around-in-the-gutter way. The other makes no sense except as the product of the Almighty Plot Hammer.Bad Teacher does have a few laughs, though they have little connection to either the plot of theme of the movie, and it's probably rates a 6 on the Judd Apatow Raunch-O-Meter. It's not aggressively repellent and you might enjoy it if you're in the right mood, but it follows Green Lantern as another big movie of summer 2011 that appears to have been made by people who didn't know what the smeg they were doing.",Bad Teacher
51,estebangonzalez10,"Bad, Terrible, Awful Teacher",2,14 September 2011,"¨She doesn't give an 'F'¨ I don't know what is worse: Cameron Diaz's character as a teacher, or the movie itself. This is really a very bad movie, terrible. It's supposed to be a comedy, but it really doesn't have many funny moments. Yes there is a couple here and there, but in a 95 minute long movie you expect much more laughs. This raunchy comedy had a whole lot of raunchy, but no comedy whatsoever. I really hated this film, and expected a lot more from Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, and Jason Segel who have done much better movies in the past. I can't blame it on them because the script they were given was really poor, but then I ask myself why would these actors want to be in a movie with a script as bad as this one. This isn't the first time that Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg fail as screenwriters in a comedy. These are the same guys that were responsible for the Year One fiasco starring Jack Black and Michael Cera. Director Jake Kasdan, however, has done far better in the past with funny films like Walk Hard and Orange County. Bad Teacher was a huge misstep for him, and for everyone else who was involved in this project. This could very well be the worse film of the year in my opinion. Cameron Diaz might not give an F, but I definitely will give this film an F for being the disaster it was.Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is not your typical High School teacher; she's not interested in her students, she smokes pot before class, and she tries to avoid teaching as much as possible. The only reason she became a teacher was because of the long summer vacations. This is her last year at the school anyway because she is getting married to her wealthy boyfriend and can now enjoy life. The only problem is that her mother-in-law points out how she is only interested in his money so he leaves her with no wedding. This means Elizabeth will have to teach yet another year until she can find a wealthy man to marry. She becomes interested in the new substitute teacher who seems to come from a wealthy family, Scott (Justin Timberlake), but he has just broken up with his long term girlfriend and doesn't feel ready for a relationship yet. Elizabeth has a rival: it's another fellow teacher named Amy (Lucy Punch) who seems to get along really well with Scott. Amy also seems to point out Elizabeth's method of teaching and tries to get her more involved with the kids. Russell (Jason Segel) is the gym teacher who has always had a thing for Elizabeth, but she never pays attention to him because he doesn't have any money. Elizabeth is more interested in winning over Scott's affection (and his money) so that she can get away from school as soon as possible. She will do whatever it takes to do this even if it revolves on getting her breasts done in order to get his attention.The movie really doesn't know where to head. At the beginning Cameron Diaz's character is so hateful but later out of nowhere she begins to have a conscious and is nice all of a sudden. On the other hand Lucy Punch's character seems so nice at first, but then turns up being mean. It's like they switched characters so the movie could find a decent ending. These changes in character can't happen all of a sudden without explanation. The movie is full of stereotypes and it completely fails as a comedy. It is too bad because Jason Segel, Cameron Diaz, and Justin Timberlake have proved they have great talent, but none of them are able to stand out and save this movie. Timberlake's character is perhaps the worst of all. I had no idea where the director was trying to go with his character. Diaz is just way too mean to be likable. Segel on the other hand is perhaps the most decent character in the movie but he really has no screen time and it's hard to see how he could fall for someone like Diaz. This is really one of the worst films I've seen all year, and can't remember any funny moments in the movie. I was expecting a lot more from the cast and found the 95 minute movie way too long. It's hard to like a movie when you are supposed to root for a highly unlikeable character such as Elizabeth Halsey. I could care less what happens to her.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Bad Teacher

55,3xHCCH,Cameron Diaz Makes This Movie Work!,6,1 September 2011,"I really have to give all the credit to Ms. Cameron Diaz. For her to be playing a crass, bitter, lazy and cruel middle school teacher whose shallow aim for teaching was to get herself a breast implant and snag a rich man to marry, Cameron still manages to make the character absolutely funny, delightful and actually worth rooting for. I really do not know how she does it, but she manages to do so. She has that certain unique indescribable quality that could make such an unpleasant character appear cute.Cameron may be so much older now from her debut in ""The Mask"" with Jim Carrey, but she still slinked in that car wash scene like the best of them. Her long legs and lithe body still serve her very well in this scene as if she were just half her present age. I thought her comic timing was on point in most of her scenes. This girl is really very funny! I cannot imagine any other actress who can run with this Elizabeth Halsey and make her likable.Being raunchy and naughty, this certainly is not a movie to watch with your parents. Cameron and her ex-lover Justin Timberlake figure in a most unusual and awkward sex scene. Scenes with cuss words, drug use, and hurting children are in liberal supply here. I generally would not like a movie with scenes like this, but thanks to Cameron Diaz and her inexplicable x-factor charm, I found it really funny and generally had a good time watching it.",Bad Teacher
56,jfgibson73,R-rated Comedy with Female Lead,7,19 August 2013,"Cameron Diaz plays a teacher who is trying to save up for breast enlargement surgery because she thinks it will get her a rich husband. It was like a cross between Danny McBride in the first season of Eastbound and Down and Charlize Theron in Young Adult. Like both of those characters, Cameron's character remains mostly unrepentant throughout. Most of the humor comes from her couldn't-give-a-care attitude (which reminded me of another film creation, Billy Bob's Bad Santa) and raunchy language. The other part of the equation is the conflict with the bubbly teacher across the hall, Amy Squirrel. You don't forget a character like her, and Lucy Punch was cute while building towards increasingly unhinged behavior. Justin Timberlake was over the top as a gee-whiz never-could-exist-in-the-real-world idealist, and Jason Segal gets to be a regular guy. Out of the other supporting roles, I liked John Michael Higgins as the principal that also could never ever exist anywhere ever. I was glad they didn't go too far with making the lead character have some kind of change of heart or show some huge emotional growth, because that didn't fit the tone of this movie at all. What little changes she did show were even more than I wanted to see, but I stayed entertained right up until the final schmaltzy letdown. So it was, overall, a worthwhile comedy.",Bad Teacher
57,pensman,What might have been,4,6 January 2012,There is nothing really redeeming about this film. One has a hint it might have developed into something if it had decent writers. Justin Timberlake must have taken this role either to goof on himself or he just lost a bet. Cameron Diaz might have been hoping for a career reviving There's Something About Mary but there's no magic here. Her character vacillates between caricature and honesty. I know that sounds paradoxical but watch the scene between Garrett Tiara (Matthew Evans) and Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) while they are on the school trip. The only thing that makes you root for her is the ongoing battle between her (Diaz) and Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).,Bad Teacher
58,aharmas,Cameron vs Lucy,6,10 July 2011,"I can only imagine what this would have been like if the writers had been inspired enough to give these gifted ladies the material to have the match of the century. Diaz has already proved herself as a gifted comedian. She employs her witty delivery and couples it with some very funny physical turns. She is not afraid to take chances and handle some raunchy material; somehow taking a detached and naive approach. She was really wonderful in ""There's something about Mary"" and ""The Mask"", and I had great hopes for ""Bad Teacher"".The worst about the movie is the typical easy way out of the filmmakers, relying on some material that borders on the vulgar and tired. We understand Cameron's character is well, flawed. There is really not much of a need to use the language she uses, and the situations she becomes involved in. There is even more disappointment when one sees how much Lucy Punch is trying throughout the film, and she's genuinely funny, delivering bad line after bad line, with much gusto, sometimes even saving some of the material. There are moments when one can't believe how great she is, and whether her scenes belong in other movie.Of course, all of this takes place in a Middle School, what could have been an endless supply of types, situations, stereotypes, etc., etc. There are a couple of funny moments, and those are given away in the preview, leaving us with pretty much nothing to experience in the film.

Still, she uses men for money, doesn't try hard at her job, is a drug user, etc. All attributes that should make me hate her. And yet, I don't. Her character doesn't even learn that many valuable lessons. I suppose it was due to the well constructed world around her. The other characters (minus Segel and Smith) just seem so fake, or happy in that annoying kind of way. They are all smiles and sunshine to the point of naivety. Segel works as the sarcastic guy that realizes how fake his job is, but makes an effort to enjoy it. Most of the humour revolves around Diaz doing things that students shouldn't, but I found it had me giggling a lot. I'm also pleased that it didn't become too preachy.

62,raulfaust,Out of class teacher,7,12 April 2012,"""Cameron Diaz plays a bad teacher who doesn't give an 'F'"". From this tagline you can already imagine how unscrupulous this teacher may be. She is one of the worst teachers I've ever seen, and that's what makes this film funny. It's not one of those comedies that you laugh hardly until you're out of breath, but it's an ironic comedy that makes you laugh once in a while. The biggest thing is that even thought her character would be hateful in real life, the story makes the spectator actually LIKE her and hate the honest people-- which is too strange to be true. In the end, we're all hoping that this character gets away with ""murder"". Not that the movie wants to show that you should steal, lie and cheat to do well in life; the story is meant only to be funny and entertain the spectator-- and it DOES. My only complaint is with Justin Timberlake; as always, he can't act decently, and his character could be played by anyone else-- more talented, of course. All in all, this is a modern and sometimes cheap comedy that you will probably enjoy.",Bad Teacher
63,Kamurai25,Wish I had teachers this bad,6,10 June 2020,"Decent watch, unlikely to watch again, and hard to recommend.I'm not the biggest fan of Cameron Diaz or Lucy Punch, but their over dramatic styling (in this movie) contrasting with an (overly) laid back attitude from the gentleman co-stars really works for this passive aggressive teach war.None of it makes a lot of sense, but for an unlikable protagonist, the story does a lot with her doing good, if for the wrong reasons.This brings up a somewhat subtle philosophical debate on morality, but I don't think this movie was necessarily designed for that. If anything, then its questioning personal motivation.I feel I had to try to really hard to find substance in this one, but if you want something where you can turn your brain off, this'll do.",Bad Teacher
64,Sandcooler,"Pure filth, I love it",8,23 February 2014,"I think there are two main elements that keep this movie from having a decent rating. Firstly, it's incredibly silly. In my opinion the style totally suits the outlandish story, but occasionally even I needed a break from all the...well, basically from the Amy character. Lucy Punch plays her perfectly, she's so unbearable cheerful that you really can't wait for bad things to happen to her. If that sounds disturbing, well it's just the effect that the movie has on you. Because that was going to be my ""secondly"". It's a disturbing ride, you're forced to side with a character with no morals or conscience because it's just so entertaining to wonder what she's going to do next. If you don't mind either of these things, you'll find that there are a lot of laughs in this one. Particularly Justin Timberlake is fantastic in this (no, seriously), he's not the centre of attention but he should be damn it. His nonsensical ""I hate slavery"" speech is probably the highlight of the movie, though there's a lot of competition. ""Bad Teacher"" is one of those typical movies that get slammed upon release, but very slowly find a cult following afterwards (and rightfully so).",Bad Teacher
65,brando647,Meh...It's Good for a Few Laughs,7,12 December 2011,"First Santa, now a middle school teacher. I feel as if we're on the verge of a new trend of bad *insert occupation here*. Bad toll booth operators, bad samurai deli clerkswhere will it end? Anyway, this is the latest from comedy director Jake Kasdan (WALK HARD) and a decently funny movie with some great moments but finds a major problem in its main character. 2011 hasn't been super strong with comedies; there have been some real good ones (BRIDESMAIDS) but most of them have been pretty forgettable (PAUL). This movie is pretty funny but it still ends on the low end of the spectrum. Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, a gold-digging narcissist who has somehow made a career of being a middle school teacher. She believes she's found her way out with a rich fiancé to tend to her every need, but it falls apart when he finally realizes she's using him. Elizabeth is forced to return to her teaching job, where she proceeds to care even less than before. She fends off the advances of gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) and focuses her attention on landing the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake). Elizabeth realizes that the only way she'll snag Scott's attention is a little self-improvement. Not becoming a decent person or anything, just a breast enhancement. From then on, she lies, cheats, and steals her way to the money she'll need for the surgery; and the only one who suffers is the good teacher (Lucy Punch) who just wants Elizabeth to do her job.In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, young Alex (Malcolm McDowell) robs, rapes, and commits horrible acts of violence but maintains a charismatic personality that allows the audience to root for him. Elizabeth Halsey in BAD TEACHER, does not. The ""protagonist"" in this movie also happens to be the least likable person in the film. As a result, the movie comes off as a little backwards. The character we're supposed to support (Elizabeth) is just a horrible person with absolutely no redeeming qualities presented until the final act of the film. And I mean none. She was a gold-digging fiancé, she's perpetually drunk/high on the job, and she coldly dismisses gym teacher Russell's advances without a glance in favor of stalking the new substitute with the massive bank account. It would almost make more sense if the film focused on Ms. Squirrel (Lucy Punch) living out her dream teaching career when trouble-making Elizabeth comes along and steals her thunder in underhanded ways. Punch should be the protagonist, and Elizabeth the antagonist. But it's not; instead we watch as the film's ""good guy"" punishes the ""bad guy"" for nothing other than doing her job and doing it well. Oh well, whateverit's just a comedy after all. Antiheroes can be fun and it works as long as the film is funny, which it mostly is. The movie is good for some laughs, though it's tough to be anything but distant as you watch everything going down without ever really being drawn into the story.Cameron Diaz really is the best person for this role. Not because she's horribly unlikeable (I assume she's not) but because she's got a decent comedic background in her films and she's still capable of pulling off drop-dead beauty. In BAD TEACHER, she's the teacher we all wished we'd had in middle school. She really drives the point home when she volunteers to work the school's charity car wash so she can pilfer funds. The supporting cast in this movie is what really makes it enjoyable. Jason Segel is always great as a lovable schlub (which pretty much sums up his gym teacher character) and Lucy Punch is hilariously eccentric as Ms. Squirrel. I've also got to give credit to Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's friend Lynn. She's probably the funniest part of the movie as the soft-spoken conservative friend who wants so badly to be as cool as Elizabeth but can't bring herself to commit to the debauchery. Honestly, the main character may be crap but the movie does have some real funny moments. I just don't know if there's enough to save it from fading out shortly after watching it. If it helps, I find the movie is funnier the less sober you are when watching it.",Bad Teacher
66,bob-rutzel-1,No reason to watch,2,24 October 2011,"Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) is a bad teacher. She has only two things she is interested in: finding a rich husband and enhancing her breast size. The first third of this movie broadcasts: nudity, foul-mouthed raunchy language, drug use, and in general a deep uncaring for everything appropriate to include her students and their concerns. The next two thirds come in calmer but the language and the uncaring are still with us. There is nothing funny in here. Everything is a scheme to get Ms Halsey what she wants and her ways know no bounds. She is up for everything to get a rich husband and the money to pay for the breast implants. She cons everyone but Amy (Punch) her chief rival, but Amy is no match for this teacher.There is no reason to see this movie. It doesn't serve anyone for anything. This is just another example of Hollywood not knowing what to do anymore. This movie is on the same level as HESHER, and BAD SANTA but not as mean-spirited, but close. Are we starting to see a trend? Perhaps, but let's hope not. The only people you cared for were the ones at the butt of Ms Halsey's foul mouthed barbs. The acting performances were fine -- it is the script that needed work. This could have been funny, but it just comes across as unfunny bathroom humor. There is no salvation to be found in here. At the end of the movie, Ms Halsey behaves the same as she did in the beginning. At least that is the implication I got out of it. Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Drug use: Yes. Language: Yes.",Bad Teacher

The only thing it's lacking is characterization, if Cameron Diaz character had more characterization then movie would have been brilliant. Cameron Diaz is truly amazing as Bad Teacher, this role is truly for her and she proved yet again that she is one of the best female lead comedians around. Justin Timberlake provided the perfect freshness and weirdness. FYI watching real life Xz Justin Timberlake Dry Humping Cameron Diaz was really Awkward. I don't remember watching dry humping in movies like Ever and then between JT and Cam, never imagined that! Jason Segel didn't get much scope but Lucy Punch was hilarious.

Isn't that everyone's dream?Cameron Diaz plays the teacher, who breaks up with her rich boyfriend. She later learns that life is more about love than money. And so on and so forth.I really like Diaz. I think she's a wonderful actress, and the roles she picks are a little off key. She's not the most attractive, but she doesn't quite fit into conventional roles. She easily could, but she doesn't. It's really interesting to see.This movie is a favorite of mine because of the way the main character carries herself and her life. I always have respect for the slacker. It's an actually hard lifestyle to keep up with. So many obstacles come your way from doing nothing. Diaz seems to take it in stride. I respect that.8 stars (probably deserves like 5 or 6)",Bad Teacher
71,Karl Self,"Bad Teacher, good comedy",8,26 June 2011,"I saw this in a special presentation in a cinema full of teachers. And judging from their guffaws they seemed to enjoy the movie.Liz is a brassy blonde who, at the end of her thirties, is on the verge of fulfilling her lifetime ambition: marrying a rich simpleton. But then his mum calls of the wedding, and Liz has to return to her reviled breadjob as a middle school teacher. To her never-ending amazement, all her other colleagues -- the middle-aged loner, the hippie, the preppy goody-two-shoed apple-cheeked nightmare -- seem to actually enjoy teaching spotty dropouts. The script does an excellent job of lining up every comedic angle of the dreary hell that is school life and linking it together with a fast-paced storyline. Cameron Diaz is excellent because she isn't afraid to actually look old, spent and wrinkled (but never unfoxy), and Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch also stand out among the excellent cast. Justin Timberlake -- eye candy for the ladies, in case you wondered. The soppy, romantic, test-audience-compatible ending -- best ignored.This is an enjoyable light-but-dark comedy that everybody who has had anything to do with school life can dig.

72,tim-764-291856,"Crass, bad and wonderfully wicked!",7,6 May 2012,"I was brought down 30 years to a besotted teenager again, as 'hottie' Cameron Diaz becomes every pubescent boy's dream teacher and she's bad. Bad at almost everything, for that matter!Very much like Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bad Santa"", this is an adult post- pub late evening grubby comedy that is boisterously and often raucously funny. Especially when seen in a group of those of similar gender and outlook.Yes, every cliché is explored and exploited and by far the funniest bits are when the pot-smoking, dangerously driving and self-centred egotist Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) is doing just that. Her out-and-out quest to finance bigger boobs surgery simply to net a wealthier and more financially sustaining husband and the way she bulldozes her way over and through everything and everyone is gloriously OTT and very entertaining.What don't work, though, are the romantic elements, which if anything, detract rather than add to the movie. Bad Teacher only loves herself, let's leave it at that. Justin Timberlake, as the suitor on her radar looks rather stupid and awkward and the gym teacher whose advances she continuously declines, Jason Segel just looks too creepily inadequate for her personality to persuade us that 'that's ever gonna happen'.Brit Lucy Punch is very funny/annoying (depending on personal choice) as another teacher with, shall we say, some very odd personal afflictions as well as teaching ones.There is some very strong language and toilet ""humour"", which I've long realised is an essential part to any US comedy these days (& which I'd rather do without, thankyou!). There are some sexy scenes too - check out the car-wash antics, with Diaz posing those 1970's pin-up poses (spray, lying over the car's bonnet, you know the sort of thing).Bad Teacher could easily slip into 2/10 or 8/10, depending on how you like your humour.

73,adamscastlevania2,Not funny enough to cover its flaws,3,12 September 2014,"(27%) Any movie that gets made with a script that clearly needs more than a few complete re-writes is never going to get a pass grade, not from me anyway. The plot is quite frankly utterly broken. We have a teacher who really despises her job, so why did she become one in the first place? You need to train/study to become a teacher and pass exams, things in which the lead character would clearly have no desire to go through. And if she has lost all passion for her work then why doesn't she just quit? What is keeping her in this job she hates so much? The plot in itself doesn't work either as the lead wants a boob job to attract the attentions of a nerdy, goody-goody Justin Timberlake (a man that quite clearly does not have a big boob preference, or at least never mentions it, so why is it even required?) who has fallen for the main rival of the movie (a very annoying Lucy Punch) but the fact is that they are both at least compatible with each other rather than Diaz's character who takes most of the movie to realise that he's clearly not the right man for her. What is it with comedies staring Cameron Diaz (""What happens in Vegas"" springs to mind) that have such dire, poorly constructed plot-lines?

75,jon.h.ochiai,"Pretty Good ""Bad Teacher""",8,12 July 2011,"""Bad Teacher"" is pretty good. In fact it is funny. The story by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg could have been more idiosyncratic, and less tangential. What they created has a certain style and flow. Amazingly, along with Director Jake Kasdan they ultimately make Cameron Diaz's totally unlikable Elizabeth humorously transform. No small feat. Cameron Diaz soars fearlessly as ""The Bad Teacher"" with graceful comedic timing. ""Bad Teacher"" surprisingly works, because she plays the character straight up, and her epiphany is deserved.In ""Bad Teacher"" Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey at JAMS—a middle school in Chicago. Diaz looks vibrant and stunningly fit. Her Halsey is a vapid gold digger biding her time until she marries her rich fiancé. This unravels when her fiancé's mother punctuates that Elizabeth only loves him for his money. Consequently, Elizabeth is forced to return to her job after summer break. As fate would have it, Scott Delecorte (brilliantly nerdy Justin Timberlake, also Diaz's former flame) is the new substitute teacher. Scott is the heir to the Delecorte Family watch fortune. Elizabeth finds her rival in fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (dangerously perky Lucy Punch). Intense Amy is alarmingly upbeat, and seems to have suffered a previous meltdown. Scott's apparent physical attraction to his former girlfriend, prompts Elizabeth to get surgical breast enhancement. There is a hysterical scene with Diaz trying out a patient's boob job.However, the procedure runs about $10,000—even with affordable financing. At the same time, Elizabeth squashes the charms of regular poor guy gym teacher Russell (laid back funny Jason Segal). How does one choose to become a gym teacher anyway? After an embarrassingly cheesy school car wash/ wet t-shirt contest gag with Diaz in cutoff shorts and soaking wet, she realizes the solution to her boob job fund. The teacher at JAMS with the highest average standardized test scores gets a $5700 bonus. So instead of showing videos in class, being either doped out or recovering from a hangover, Elizabeth becomes drill sergeant English teacher. There is a hysterical scene when she slams basketballs off student's heads for incorrect answers. Or when she is totally frustrated by the inept practice test results, she screams that is why the Japanese students beat their asses—however, in less delicate euphemism. Then the story takes a weirder turn even for itself.At the predictable arc during a field trip gone nearly awry, Elizabeth has a conversation with geeky Garrett (sweet hearted Matthew J. Evans), who springs nonlinear when he is rejected by the love of his life too cool for school Chase (good Kathryn Newton). Diaz tells him that Chase will never like him, because he is not cool. She was Chase once, and likely still is. Garrett points out that the kid Chase likes is stupid. Her Elizabeth admits, ""He's a moron."" Elizabeth tells Garrett that he is sensitive, and for now cool rules. His time will come in college. Diaz is brilliantly funny and insightful. Russell (Segal) wryly says, ""That's a nice thing you did for him."" There is cute punch line; however, Diaz and Segal level out the often crass context, with a reassuring yet unsentimental human touch. Even at our most self centric, we will protect those put upon.The universe has a way of balancing out in ""Bad Teacher"". ""Bad Teacher"" is not perfect. It is funny and worth your patience. Diaz, Punch, Segal, and Timberlake play together hilariously well. Cameron's boldness really makes it work. ""Bad Teacher"" is really pretty good, all things considered.",Bad Teacher

The sneering at the well-intentioned, the relentless mocking of the disadvantaged, and the courage to show us sometimes nice guys (or gals) DO finish last is like ambrosia to my ears.However, I can't help but compare and contrast to a similar film by the name of Bad Santa, and not just because of the name. Both movies have alcoholic, drug-addled losers in the main role who are only in their current job for personal satisfaction. They steal, cheat and manipulate every good soul around them to achieve their goal, before finding some sort of minor personal redemption by the end.But unlike the Xmas film, Bad Teacher operates to so many extremes of what it mocks it all becomes a wee bit improbable. No-one for instance, could be as sickly-sweet as Lucy Punch's character in real life... you can tell this is a comic creation all the way, and she plays it too broadly. Same with Justin Timberlake.... they make him so obnoxiously nice in his part, he is never that funny, just plain irritating. And he ditches that persona entirely for a startlingly bad dry-humping scene late on, the less said about the better.Thank Heaven for Cameron Diaz though... She might be damaging children's delicate mental health with her corruptible influence, but at least she's a fleshed out person. All the humorous moments flow through her and her utter disdain for the goody two shoes surrounding her. A school like this, with it's right-on attitude and it's stultifying political correctness would probably be more of a nightmare to attend than a little place I know called Potterspury Lodge.It's just a shame then, that unlike the slightly superior Bad Santa, sometimes it just gets so OTT that it crosses the line between satire and silliness. It's still generally a chucklesome affair, but I just feel like it could have been better. Ah, well... 6/10",Bad Teacher

One thing that I did appreciate - and it's not very common in this type of movies - is that the main character ELIZABETH (played by Cameron Diaz) didn't get punished by her ""dirty schemes"".

I liked the theme of a teacher who absolutly doesn't care and is extremely shallow, but the movie fell a little short of delivering it. Don't get me wrong it's still funny and has its sexy moments, but it could have been much better.The first question I have that's not answered in this movie about the Character Elizabeth - How did Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) get to this spot in her life? Is she a real teacher? How long has she been a teacher? Did she used to be a good teacher before and has declined or has she always been this bad at it? - There are way to many questions unanswered in this film as they fail to give a back story. Following the story they did give, Elizabeth's character was a little all over the place. She was ""sexy"" and ""bad"" and yet in a PG way. If we're making an R rated comedy then let's go all out with it. She didn't feel sly or naughty enough, for example Jennifer Aniston more then succeeded with this type of role in Horrible Bosses. Cameron needed to bring up the intensity of it or the writers needed to tweak the script. As the film goes on we get to see a glimpse at Elizabeth being a ""real"" teacher, but then quickly slides back from it. Where is the character growth? There is some, but its very subtle. When I watched this I kept expecting ""more"" either get down and dirty and go all out or improve the character to great extremes, instead the film was consistent with a character that made you shake your head in disapproval. I understand that Elizabeth was a very shallow person, but the writer should have showed us glimpses of the ""real"" her, a little depth with who she really is and what she really wants in life. If she has a heart to party and live on the edge then why didn't the writer put in scenes to show that. Is her goal really only money and ""things""? If she's a shopaholic why didn't the writer bring that out more with spending issues? Instead the writer gave us a sense that this woman is just plain lazy with no desire to work, but also wants to sit at home alone in a corner smoking up? Boring.Jason Segal was widely under used in this film. Every time he came on camera you could feel the chemistry between him and Cameron. His performance felt natural and smooth, and it made me want to see more of him. Justin Timberlakes's performance was cringe worthy. The script and lines for him was terrible. As a rich man who is sensitive and has a love for children - why on earth did the writers make him into a seven year old child, in a mans body? He was over the top gullible and dumb.

The trick here is to plan. I considered the best circumstance to watch this flick was to eat pizza and have a few beers, as many as it took to avoid negative vibes. As it turns out, when eating an oily (that's how I like it) pizza and drinking beer, the movie is entertaining. You have a slutty, dirty talking Cameron Diaz shaking her booty and showing some skin; what more can a guy ask for on a cloudy rainy summer afternoon slacking off. The movie goes extremely well with the aforementioned food and beverage I've sufficiently promoted. There were several scenes with Justin Timberlake; I don't care for him, I'm a guy. Jason Segel also plays in this movie and him I could tolerate even with less beer; not so for Timberlake. I won't need to recommend the movie; those who will choose to see it, will.

The movie was more of a shock value than a comedy. Bad teacher is a similar case, but I laughed a lot more. With Bad Santa, you could see Billy Bob in that role. The main thing that made me laugh was seeing Diaz as such a terrible person. And it's fascinating to see her finally spread her wings and fly for the first time in a bit. But no offense to those other movies, because I liked them.Diaz's Halsey is a bad person, just to sum it up. When her sham of an engagement(she was engaged for his money)comes to an end, she is forced to go back to work... as a teacher. Well, she was one, then quit, and now she's back.When she gets back, she meets a substitute(Justin Timberlake) who's family has an inheritance to watches. So, she jumps on board and tries to date him. But that's not without competition. This guy has a crush on Amy Squirrell(the brilliantly perky but bonkers Lucy Punch). So, it's up to Elizabeth to, you know, do what she does best. Ruin it.I liked Elizabeth. Though she's obviously a terrible person, it was a lot of fun to see her do all of the terrible things that she does. I laughed out loud a few times. I also had a lot of fun watching Lucy Punch's character. Punch, a British actress, is terrific.She was pretty perfect for this role.Overall, Bad teacher isn't the funniest movie of 2011. I preferred Bridesmaids and Horrible Bosses. But it's still a hilarious ride, and, a lot of fun. I definitely think it's worth a rent, just because you'd have to see it to believe it.B+",Bad Teacher
87,Maniac-9,Totally shallow and vapid,4,29 January 2012,While the movie is far from boring it's basically nothing more then fluff. Very few of the characters are believable in their roles in the movie and most of the actors didn't have that much chemistry together. Hard to root for Cameron Diaz's character when she has no redeemable values whatsoever.Diaz's character makes no effort to teach the entire movie but suddenly she finds out that the teacher whose students score the highest on a state test gets a big bonus and she out of nowhere learns how to teach.It seems like the producers of this movie just liked the movie Bad Santa and decided to make the same movie just with a teacher in the place of Santa.This is most definitely a step in the wrong direction career wise for Cameron Diaz. She should fire her agent for signing onto this project.,Bad Teacher
88,CANpatbuck3664,Bad Teacher Comes Across as a Bolder and More Exciting Comedy Than it Really is,6,25 February 2017,"R-rated comedies are now a very popular genre due to the success of mainly the Judd Apatow comedies (e.g. 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad). What once was a very popular style of film with unique comic genius sprouting it has become a little diluted, watered-down and it can be hard to distinguish between or remember them. In the past, we had a case of extremes with some movies of this kind doing really well at the box office (Horrible Bosses, Bridesmaids, Ted and Deadpool) to some doing only okay business (Fist Fight, The Nice Guys and The Boss). Bad Teacher was able to drum up that kind of business through the sex appeal of Cameron Diaz. Whether that translates into a good movie; you will have to decide for yourself.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin the movie with middle-school teacher Elizabeth Hazley (Cameron Diaz) who is retiring after the finished school year. She is too young retire but she is more interested in sponging off her rich fiancée. The other teachers do not seem to be to upset about her departure because it is a widely held belief that Elizabeth is a horrible teacher. She has no relationship with her students and does not a care at all for their well being. After she gets home, her husband is at the door with her bags packed. It turns out he caught on just in time and he kicks her out of the house. After sulking in her apartment and after smoking some very potent weed she returns to school at the start of the year because of her lack of other options and is befriended by Lynn Davies (Phyllis Smith) who is more of a sweet sycophant who lets Elizabeth bully her around. Elizabeth decides that she needs to attract another wealthy man and to do this, she should have breast augmentation surgery. She is willing to lie, cheat and steal to achieve this but she is currently without the funding.She is immediately attracted to the rich, substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who is naïve to her plot and very nerdy to be honest and she also makes an enemy of Amy Squirrell (Lucy Punch) who is a very committed teacher but is also a type a control freak who is less than impressed by Elizabeth's teaching philosophies (e.g. having the students watch movies all class while she drinks and sleeps). Things do not go well for her off the start. Even through her manipulation she cannot interest Scott who is better suited for Amy and she cannot raise the money even though she steals from parents for ""tutoring sessions."" She also berates the kids and steals the money from their charity car wash. At the same time, she is having to resist the subtle advances of the gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) who is very genuine and cool but he d does not fit her criteria for her ideal man. After this she hears from Principal Wally Snur (John Michael Higgins) about a bonus given to the teacher whose class finishes the highest on state test scores. With this information, Elizabeth changes her style on a dime and becomes a bullying authoritarian who is abusive to her students to try and get them to learn the material faster.Whether you will like this movie or not will come down to where you fall in terms of crass humour; the jokes are mainly done through extremely vulgar language and pratfalls and I found them to be really hit or miss. Cameron Diaz did make me laugh a few times but her language and character are so vulgar and nasty that it really turned me off. I don't care if she is hot, it's to the point where it would get her smacked. There was also very little arc to her character which disappointed me. I don't expect her to change completely but she only came to self-realization on a selective basis. Now on the flip side the acting was pretty good even though most of the characters were unrealistic. A lot of the character actors were solid including Smith and Higgins. They definitely made the most out of what they were given. Jason Segel had by far the easiest character to like but he really wasn't central to the plot at all. The writing was pretty lazy here and it really depends on your sense of humour. I fell somewhere in the middle. Some of the stuff worked, some of it didn't. I would say the jokes hit on a rate of 40/60. Now the plot did offer some twists and turns and I actually liked where they decided to go with the ending but it is by no means exceptional. It happens just to be one of the few things I did like about the movie.Now some of the performances weren't bad but my sheer dislike of their characters brought them down. I thought this was probably the weakest I've seen Justin Timberlake, he played Scott as a passive aggressive douche/wimp. Lucy Punch really did try as Amy but again the fact that her character turns out to be as bad as Elizabeth even though we're rooting for her off the start, ruins it.I'm split on this movie. I liked about 40% of it but I still keep coming back to the point that this movie hinges on Cameron Diaz and I just fell that she failed to carry the movie. Did she try? Yes but you have to make the audience care just a little bit which didn't happen. The movie did make me laugh several times though so it does earn a 6/10. I'm glad that Cameron is taking different roles though. This is a decent but ultimately forgettable summer comedy. I would recommend it only to die hard fans of the genre.",Bad Teacher

93,diac228,Let's hope they paid the actors more than the writers.....,7,24 June 2011,"Bad Teacher is a great concept that resulted in a style of humor like most of the Adult Swim cartoons you see today: When the jokes hit they hit well, but when they miss, they miss quite badly. The cast was delightful, but could only go so far with the material. As a matter of fact, it was the cast that saved the movie from being a total disaster by providing their comedic chops, their charm, and their good comic timing that you don't see enough of nowadays. Despite all that however, Bad teacher is a shiny apple with a few rotten parts.Elizabeth Hasley (Cameron Diaz) is a foul-mouthed, bitter, and quite nasty teacher that is keeping the job only to pay the bills after her rich fiancée dumps her. Facing debt, aging, and loneliness, Elizabeth starts setting her sights on a boob job and on a new (rich) teacher (Justin Timberlake), whom has also captured the attention of a manipulative rival (Lucy Punch). The script was helmed by two veteran writers of The Office (Gene Stupnitsky, Lee Eisenberg) as they use their non-television ratings boundaries to mix plenty of vulgar and raunchy humor with even some tidbits of cruel humor. Unfortunately, their lack of boundaries led to a mediocre script.This film's biggest falters come in the form of the script. Despite the promise in the premise and the cast involved, the script was convoluted, and didn't have much structure until the second half. As a matter of fact, the film switches up the pace very unexpectedly when the next act approaches. Pretty much almost all the crude and vulgar humor failed to draw laughs, with one notable exception involving one of the odder ""sex"" scenes in recent memory. The movie was a great idea not exactly explored upon, and was full of smaller ideas that were not utilized. Many good smaller characters did not get enough time in the script; most notably the students, the gym teacher (Jason Segal) and the main character's roommate (Erik Stonestreet).Despite the writing being a fickle mess, the cast was superb, from the small roles to the big ones. Cameron Diaz I can honestly say is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood, because she rarely ever delivers a mediocre or weak performance. She has this aura, this energy that can save the worst of films (See: What Happens in Vegas) and it is no different here. Despite her smoking/drinking/vulgar/manipulative/cynical/cruel/superficial ways, we still secretly root for her to succeed in reaching her goal. Very few actresses can pull off this type of charm.Lucy Punch, despite having a bit of questionable material, delivers as Diaz's rival. Jason Segal could have helped the movie a lot more if he was in it more often, as he delivered the laughs every time he was on-screen with his wit, sarcasm, and I-don't-care attitude. Television staples Phyllis Smith and Erik Stonestreet were hilarious in the far-too-few moments they were on-screen. The movie does indeed have its laughs, but the potential was so much greater considering all the talented actors involved.Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.Bottom Line: Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed, but relentlessly saved by the energetic cast. This movie could have mixed the dark charm of Bad Santa with the subtle workforce ridiculousness humor of Office Space to become something very, very special. But neither style of humor was dwelled upon deep enough. The first half had its laughs, but was far too convoluted and was salvaged mainly because of the hilarity of Cameron Diaz. The movie definitely picks up later, but by then its too late, the potential was wasted. Either way, you will certainly laugh, you will remain entertained, but will also be bothered by what it could have been.",Bad Teacher

95,Okonh0wp,A great Cameron Diaz vehicle,8,18 November 2014,"The comic set-up of a slacker in an important profession is getting some legs lately with Bad Teacher, Bad Judge, Bad Santa, and Brooklyn Nine Nine (which is essentially ""Bad Cop"") and why shouldn't it? TV, film and real-life are all inundated with people who take their jobs too seriously, so this is a refreshing charms. The film comes in a phase in Cameron Diaz's career where she was no longer America's hot it girl (her ""advanced"" age is even referenced in Diaz's other 2011 film ""The Green Hornet) and could have fun indulging in her comic persona which generally has a bit of a bite to it. The film can be read as a commentary on Diaz actively rebelling the shorter expiration date for hot film actresses by trying in vain to raise the money for a boob job and attempting to con real life ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake (who likely will not run out of roles 20 years from now) into marrying him. Back when Diaz was known for her supermodel looks and screen presence, her comic gifts were taken for granted which is why this has been such an interesting phase in her career.As for the film itself, while the premise is risqué, the film is in the mold of a classic comedy. It uses the medium well (something movies have to do more and more in this age of TV comedy) by filling up its two hours with nicely outstretched character arcs and big scenes (i.e. the car wash, the field trip). Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins and the endearing Jason Segel shine strong in supporting parts as well.",Bad Teacher
96,nickmesafilms,Bad Teacher (2011) - I Have Such a Terrible Teacher!,6,30 October 2011,"""Bad Teacher"" is one of those movies where the audience just agrees with the movie that their own teacher is a mean, ruthless, antagonizing, and a messed-up (fill in the blanks). Cameron Diaz stars in a new comedy, where she plays an inappropriate teacher who starts crushing for Justin Timberlake as the new substitute teacher, and starts raising money for useless boob jobs. Then she ends up having Jason Segel's gym teacher trying to crush on her, tries being friends with John Michael Higgins as a dolphin-obsessed principal, and tries to avoid the antagonizing advantages of Lucy Punch's across-the-hall teacher. Now, ""Bad Teacher"" may have its moments, but it's quite disappointing. First of all, one of the only things I liked about this movie was Cameron Diaz's surprising performance. She is really charismatic, and her stupidity and sexy looks makes her funny. Also, I'm a total fan of Jason Segel, and I really loved him in this movie. Although there were some funny moments, ""Bad Teacher"" has its negative moments. ""Bad Teacher"" is not really a perfect comedy, because it's not well-written, well-raunchy, and not even well-comedic like ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Horrible Bosses"". Also, Justin Timberlake makes an average performance that any other actor can do, and John Michael Higgins was okay. But Lucy Punch created the most weirdest and stupid performance ever on screen, and I hated her so much in this movie. She is such an annoying role, and I hope she gets a Razzie award nomination. ""Bad Teacher"" may have it's funny moments, and maybe Cameron and Jason delivered hilarious performances, it's not as good as all the other better comedies of the year.

98,nicolechan916,Shallow story but good acting.,6,17 September 2015,"This film is not so much about the story as it is about the comedy. The title itself eludes to the comedy, which can be said to be bad. However this 'bad comedy' is what makes it funny.The story is not that interesting as it does get boring at times but it is not repetitive. The main focus is on Elizabeth and Diaz does a good job acting. You might not think her acting is good, but based on previous movies she has done I would say that this is not the type of character she is used to. Therefore I would say that she did a good job in this film as a badass foul mouth teacher. She delivered her lines convincingly and really fit into her character's shoes well. Punch does a good job of playing the uptight rule- abider, goody two shoes. I don't quite know why but it was either Timberlake himself or his character that really irked me. My friends and I were just fascinated at the possibility that Smith was probably the voice of Sadness in Inside Out (she is!).There is not much to say of this film, except that it mainly plays off Elizabeth's appalling language (especially around children) to produce laughter. There is also quite a few scenes that I find a bit crude or stupid, but that just adds to the type of comedy this film promotes. Additionally, there are some pretty predictable plot lines and endings but all in all, it was not such a terrible experience.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Bad Teacher

Unfortunately for Bad Teacher, the poor execution element takes place.Cameron Diaz was born for the role of this daring, diverting and badass teacher. Her hilarious savageness lives up to your expectations of her character, especially after you've discovered the mature rating. The moments in which the class is focused on unnecessary movies could've been extended to a more exciting view, as they are only kept brief and short. But the movie lets us down when it comes to the classroom.It's fun to witness Diaz's Elizabeth smoking pot and letting her vulgar mouth go wild during school hours. However, most of her viewpoint is focused on her wanted breast enlargement. As a result, majority of the film is quite bland and the entire thing is just forgettable. It's also definitely one of those comedies where every truly well-crafted piece of humour is wasted in the trailers or clips.

Unfortunately, Cameron Diaz's character reminds me of many teachers in Virginia schools. They don't really teach. They get away with so much. They cheat so their students can have the highest test scores. And they never get in trouble with the principal, despite their horrible teaching.

There are a whole bunch of movies like this and one movie comes in my mind for now. Easy A, a movie like this filled with similar elements but had sensible way to show everything. Here the story suffers from overpowering a particular individual and in this case Cameron Diaz character. The place and the people around her are shown as if they are living under some burden and indirectly Cameron looked to be dominating all the time. The ending was particularly unimpressive where we see a lot happening suddenly. After seeing the ending I am genuinely confused about the motto of the film regarding good and bad. Performance wise Cameron performed OK and not astonishingly, but a big letdown was from the supporting cast owing to their wooden dialogs. The story itself was highly predictable. I could not sympathize with the central character at any point of time.VERDICT: 'Don't bother.'",Bad Teacher

107,thekyles99,OK it wasn't the greatest however Diaz sorta makes it work!,4,11 July 2011,Cameron Diaz seems to be showing her versatility these days in the scripts she picks and i don't fully blame the crappiness of this film totally on her. Without her it would've been ten times worse in my opinion. I liked her attitude in this as it only adds to her around sexiness. Now if a director is new to making a film which contains a lot of vulgarity in it may i suggest calling up the king himself Judd Apatow and getting some suggestions on how it's done. One thing i will say for movies that promise loads of laughs and that don't deliver at least they have an entertaining script along with a storyline as to keep us watching in one way or another.,Bad Teacher
108,mirwais-orbit,Badness is missing.,5,3 August 2011,"I've always considered Cameron Diaz a good actress, even sometimes making average movies or accepting weak roles that never required much of her capabilities. Even though, she sporadicly make movies with quite interesting roles like: My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Being John Malkovich (1999), Any Given Sunday (1999), Gangs Of New York (2002), The Box (2009), among others. Even in Charlie's Angels (2000) and in CA: Full Throttle (2003) she gives very funny moments.Bad Teacher seemed to be the movie she was waiting to be able to use all her powering beauty and strong presence together with a heavy dark humor, since she already had experience characters with some dark sides but they were never entirely bad as the bad teacher seemed to be.Well, the teacher is bad, but not heavily and totally bad, and a lot of badness is missing. She's just a bitter woman that lives an unhappy life with no money and no big tits. She isn't intelligent enough to be a teacher, but is enough to be placed as one. Some kind disappointing for those ones who expected not a very interesting plot or something like that, but at least a character that could use and abuse all the meanings of what is to be bitchy and mean. But the concept of the word may be different for the writers and also the development of the movie is quite poor. If being bad means smoking pot and sleeping during classes, pff... please, I've met worse. Maybe writers should have watched some Bette Davis classics as inspirations about what the meaning ""bad"" means between humans, like Of Human Bondage (1934), The Letter (1940) or The Little Foxes (1941), just as a start. But anyway, Cameron is getting better with the age, her timing is really great, and she seems to be just having fun in this one. Lucy Punch, as Amy Squirrel, is incredibly funny and talented, and for those ones who are not familiar to her I always recommend Being Julia (2004), maybe her first major role. Justin Timberlake does his part well and also the rest of the cast, helping to save the movie from the drowning. But in the end is all about Cameron. Even the movie being weak, with a tedious plot and not even a memorable scene or great sequence, Bad Teacher is watchable just because of her presence.",Bad Teacher

110,troy-manatunga,Eye full for the men!,5,2 July 2011,"It's almost quite obvious that Cameron Diaz is hitting 40. An actress who had me at the word go since I was a young l lad in the ever so famous ""The Mask"" to me was always sssmmoking! Sadly I have to come with terms that the once super-hot Hollywood princess is showing faint signs of aging in her new release ""Bad Teacher"". This is my first reaction when I saw her, however let me not discourage you readers; she still has it in her! She has it a lot! Some may even love her like this! With her 10/10 screen presence and also with the mixture of her diverse talent and bad girl attitude justice is rightly served to Elizabeth Halsey. Alongside her, Jason Segal (I just love his talent) & John Micheal Higgins were the show stealers in this fast paced summer comedy release. The 2 boys bring it up a notch from the average, and keep on trying to bring laughter at us and deliver at every possible time. Justin Timberlake on the other hand, tries something new (he has never done a role in this degree), where he has to underplay a lot of the times, in fact the script is as such that he has to always underplay a lot and maybe this gets to him a bit, and I personally felt this is a directorial flaw rather than Justin's. Phyllis Smith was a sweetheart and a lady with a lot of talent; I sincerely hope she gets explored more in the future as I feel there is a lot of bottled up talent within her. Lucy Punch, I loved to hate her and so will you. A healthy and wise blend in talent within the cast. Director Jake Kasdan;considerably a newbie in my terms to my mental hard drive on movie trivia fairs averagely. I am going to and fro and trying to find the reason why the movie didn't take off as expected with such a noteworthy cast, Also to mention ""Orange County"" by director Jake Kasdan was wildly entertaining. On a personal level I feel it's the writers that should take the hit, however on a professional approach I feel it should be evenly laid across as a directorial and writing drawback. I am certain when Columbia Pictures picked up this script they saw massive potential and I am also sure there has been many re writes on several levels since it was picked up on a pre- production stage. Furthermore I am certain at the point the script was read it did sound more hilarious than it is post production. For a comedy Rated R there is always high expectations from the audience. I am no high rolling million dollars' worth producer, however I am serious lover of the art of entertainment and sometimes one should always think that we the viewers are the reason they the producers are in business!Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) a stunningly good looking teacher who loves the green bills is dumped by her ever so rich fiancé. Having to come back to school to actually WORK for her bread is not something Elizabeth is comfortable with. Work becomes more fun when she runs into the new sub Scott Delacortte (Justin Timberlake) who has no shortage with his supply of green dollar bills. Trying to get back her lost rich life, Elizabeth tries to win Scott over by trying to show him that she too can have a big heart just like his ex!

111,Bravesfan17,"Raunchy and vulgar, but worth it",8,25 June 2011,"Raunchy, vulgar: Those are just two of the words to describe the movie Bad Teacher. On that note, this movie is still well worth seeing. Cameron Diaz stars in the title role as Elizabeth Halsey, a middle school teacher who really doesn't care about how her students do in school. At the end of a school year, she quits so she can rely on her fiancé to be her sugar daddy. When she comes home to find that he wants nothing to do with her, she has to keep her job in order to support herself. Once Elizabeth is back in school, she could care less about her students. Instead of teaching her students, she just shows movies while she sleeps at her desk. Her motivation is to just have money to get larger breasts so she can attract a guy and turn that guy into her sugar daddy.Elizabeth becomes attracted to the new substitute teacher Scott, played by Justin Timberlake. Timberlake is okay in this role, but he doesn't have any moments where he shines as an actor.While Elizabeth is attracted to Scott, a gym teacher named Russell, played by Jason Segel, is attracted to her. Segel continues to show how great he is as an actor. Segel does really well at making Russell a guy who will not stop until he has Elizabeth's affection.A performance who really stood out to me was right across the hallway from Elizabeth. This was in the form of Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel, a sassy, overachieving teacher who is always striving to be the best. In the film when Elizabeth's motivations change so that she gets a big bonus, Amy and Elizabeth become rivals. Their rivalry is hilarious on many levels.Director Jake Kasdan knows how to keep the humor intact to the story. He does great at making the story raunchy and vulgar, yet hilarious at the same time.

115,David_Brown,Laugh A Minute,10,28 July 2012,"This film had me laughing out loud, and I think it deserves 10/10 stars.(Perhaps the BEST comedy since ""The Hangover""). Something else: I really detest Cameron Diaz (Except ""There's Something About Mary""), because generally speaking, she is not hot, nor can she act (As an example: See ""The Sweetest Thing"" (Or better yet, DON'T)). But this film is different. Spoilers ahead: The scene at the car wash, with Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) in a wet tee shirt and shorts is certainly worth watching just for itself, and seeing what she does to the nasty Amy Squirrel (Perhaps the best name for a miserable character since Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.""), makes the film worth watching. There is nothing that can be done to Miss Squirrel that she does not deserve: Such as when Elizabeth gives her a spiked apple, and she gets a nasty rash, and when Squirrel has the Locksmith break into her Elizabeth's desk (After dragging it into her office and saying it was hers) and finds evidence that she cheated on a test and Squirrel snitches on her, she is able to turn it around and make people think Squirrel is is a drunk and a sleaze bag, and get her kicked out of the school, and put into a real dangerous school. The funny thing about Squirrel, is how the people closest to her (Her students and Principal Snur (John Michael Higgens)are the only ones to know what a nasty B***H she really is). Squirrel reminds me of a low class version of Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) from ""Working Girl."" whose character was explained perfectly by Tess McGill (Melanie Griffin): ""Look, you, maybe you've got everyone around here fooled with this saint act you have going, but do not ever speak to me again like we don't know what really happened, you got me?"" The only difference was in ""Working Girl"" only Tess knew, here others knew. Finally, although Elizabeth was a shallow, gold digging, drunk, you certainly like her a lot better than phonies like Parker or Squirrel, because she has a chance of redemption because she does not consider herself better than others, and nor does she pretend she is. Very easy grade of 10/10 Stars.",Bad Teacher

Maybe Kasden has no feel for vulgarity, or maybe he just has no talent. SPOILER (sort of) There is an interesting scene towards the end. Deiz's character is a person so terrible and selfish it's supposed to be funny, or maybe we're supposed to like her because everyone else at the school is a nice guy twit. Yet all through the movie this one nice guy slacker is inexplicably interested in her. He seems to see the good in her or maybe it's just because She's so hot. In a movie like this it's too corny to have the lead see the error in her ways and show her hidden virtue. So the nice guy slacker and her finally get together in an awkward scene because, ...well, just so the movie can end.

119,chaz-28,Bad Santa in a Middle School,4,23 June 2011,"Bad Teacher is Bad Santa in a middle school instead of a mall. This is Cameron Diaz's movie as she is in almost every scene and limits Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel to mostly throw away screen time. Diaz plays 7th grade teacher Elizabeth Halsey whose only goal is to marry rich. She almost succeeds as the movie opens, but a protective mother-in-law thwarts her plans. This forces Elizabeth to return for another school year while she schemes ways to steal money from the school for a boob job. In Elizabeth's mind, it is not her bad attitude or lack of personality which keeps her from landing a sugar daddy, it is her flat chest.The other teachers are played quite well by an effective supporting cast including her main rival across the hall, Lucy Punch, and an always amusing Phyllis Smith from The Office. Justin Timberlake arrives at school as a new teacher, quite possibly with family money to spare, which inevitable creates the feud between Diaz and Punch as they attempt to woo the newbie. Jason Segel is the gym teacher who has taken a shine to Elizabeth even though he knows exactly what kind of teacher she really is. Elizabeth shows a movie every day in class while she sneaks mini-bottle liquor behind her desk and smokes weed in the parking lot. She also eats an abnormally high amount of junk food to maintain the flawless body which she flaunts around in skimpy clothes.The dirty jokes are actually pretty good across the board and Diaz's obscene foul mouth produces plenty of shocking moments. Unfortunately, Bad Teacher doesn't work. The character of Elizabeth is not believable for one second, Timberlake's character is just ridiculous, and Jason Segel might be on screen for a whole four minutes. There are plot holes involving a state test Elizabeth must have known about from the year prior which she is surprisingly unfamiliar with this year and a principal's dolphin obsession which goes nowhere. Granted, there should be a little leeway on believable characters in a comedy, but this bad teacher is so left field that her antics display a level of parody and mocking rather than true comedy.",Bad Teacher

121,Treyroo,Unoriginal,5,24 November 2012,"She's a teacher and she's bad? Genius! How'd you come up with that? Give that man, or rather those men, gold stars. Yes, it took two men to write this script. And the result? I almost feel stupid typing it.Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey. An aspiring trophy wife whose hopes are dashed when her spineless fiancée calls off their wedding at the urging of his mother and financial advisors. So she returns tail between her legs, to teaching middle school. A job she took because she believed it required little effort and offered a summer vacation. And, almost immediately, she discovers a teacher from a wealthy family trying to find his classroom. She makes her intentions very clear, though Scott, the teacher (played by Justin Timberlake) doesn't catch on. And soon her efforts appear in vain when Scott (Timberlake) encounters the ridiculously named Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) whose hokey goodhearted nature ranges from annoying to nauseating. In addition, Diaz's character maintains a friendship with the gym teacher (Jason Segel) based in shared apathy and sarcasm.Is it funny? It has its moments, but overall the comparisons made between this and Bad Santa are accurate. Bad Santa being the role Billy Bob Thornton liked so much that he played it several times in ""different"" movies as characters with different names. This facsimile, on the other hand, is tame by comparison in addition to being largely dependent on the looks of its 38 year-old star who really should've passed this sort of thing. Lowest common denominator drivel.",Bad Teacher
122,moviemaniac008,"Good comedy, but not without it's faults...",6,27 June 2011,"I must say that my hopes were kind of high after seeing the red band trailer for Bad Teacher. In Bad Teacher, we are shown the story of Elisabeth Huksey (Cameron Diaz), who is a teacher in a junior high. She smokes pot, drinks alcohol in class, swears like a sailor and doesn't care about the education of her students (makes them watch movies like ''Scream'' instead). She's just in it for the money. Throughout the film, her goal is to save up as much money as possible in order to pay for her breast implants, which she desires a lot in order to seduce Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a new substitute teacher, even though Russell Gettis, the gym teacher (played by Jason Segel), has a crush on her. Meanwhile, the state bonus for the best teacher in the state could help Elisabeth get her breast implants, but she will have to tough it out with Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch)...In short, I guess that anyone who read the above synopsis knows where the movie is going. Although the film isn't always predictable, there are many times where it is. In fact, I predicted what the ending would be 35 minutes into the film (well at least part of it, because another part of the ending is totally random). The gags are, for the most part, hit-and-miss: when the gags are funny, they make you laugh, and I mean they make you laugh a lot. But there are times where they miss, and when you can easily hear a little cricket sound throughout the silence of the audience. Elsewhere, Lucy Punch's character was probably meant to be shown as an obnoxious woman, but she got onto my nerves so fast that when her jokes appeared, she just didn't make me laugh so much (although I don't blame Punch for that: Maybe directing???)But my main complaint with this film is that the story really seems to go nowhere. The story focuses on Elisabeth trying to get her implants all along. It never/rarely does anything constructive or creative to elaborate on her situation. There isn't much of a story in there, just a bunch of situations here and there where Elisabeth is in some kind of a pickle. Also in the story, the character of Russell Gettis (pleasant though is, all thanks to Jason Segel) wasn't necessary at all to keep the story going. As far as I can tell, he's pretty much there as a minor tool to make sure the movie keeps going on. And what about the kids? The movie is called Bad Teacher but we rarely see what's become of her students except for two of them. I was expecting something a bit (yes that's a bit of a broad comparison) like School of Rock, where the children do play a role in the story: maybe her kids helping her get the money for her implants would have actually brought the story somewhere.However, as much as I am bashing about it, there are a lot of positive things to say about this movie too. Cameron Diaz as Elisabeth Hulsey was perfect: The role seemed written for her. She shines in this film. Timberlake, Segel, and Punch also shine in their roles due to roles that also seem to be written directly for them, which sort of makes you realize how natural they feel in their characters's shoes. And just like I mentioned before, there is some pretty funny stuff in this film, and when it's funny, you will laugh out loud quite a bit.That being said, this film is far from being a masterpiece. I felt it was lacking pace and that it lacked a real story to interest the viewer. If you're a teen (movie's target audience) and are searching for a raunchy comedy, then maybe you should go see it. But for anyone else, I'd recommend to wait for the DVD release or for it to air on TV. All in all, a disappointing film, but still one that shines in some places thanks to the performances of it's actors and some clever jokes here and there.",Bad Teacher

More important for my low rating is that 'Bad Teacher' is a poorly written farce and at times, is excruciating to watch when it subjects some of the supporting characters to humiliation to get a laugh. More lines now to meet the ridiculous 10 line minimum: There is a scene in the gym where the plain looking, highly overweight teacher 'friend' of Elizabeth (Diaz) shows up.

Cue attempts to blackmail, embezzle and other unoriginal things to get the money. Inevitably, the tart gets a heart.And it's all very uninteresting, really. Diaz puts her all into the role. I think she's great in it. Similarly, there are good turns from Timberlake, Jason Segel and a really excellent Lucy Punch. But the problem is that they are good actors in an uninspired and bad film. The writing is mainly boring; the story is constantly boring; and you're left at the end feeling, well, bored. I did anyway.It's a disappointing film, because a lot of talent is being sorely wasted.

There were so many awkward silences in the theater I attended, so many moments that you knew the writers wanted you to laugh, but it just.wasn't.funny. In fact, some of the more offensive parts sneak up on you and you're just left dumbfounded, like ""Did they really mean to put that in the movie?"" See the periodic race references. They are a major miss, borderline racist and all the way offensive.Anyway, I'm surprised Timberlake agreed to play this nothing role, after getting so much acclaim for other roles.

134,darklydreamingrahu,Funnier than the reviews,7,6 August 2011,"Bad Teacher is funny in ways it shouldn't be. Cameron Diaz owns the role of Elizabeth as the foul-mouthed, pot smoking, trashy blonde teacher with a twisted outlook on life. Obscenities and bizarre sexual innuendo roll off her tongue perfectly. Justin Timberlake is hilarious and awkward as Scott. His character is complex and....well he's just awkward....there's no other way to describe it. Lucy Punch is the perfect counterpart to both Diaz and Timberlake's characters as Amy Squirrel. Her over-the-top performance is one you will remember. Jason Segel steals every scene he's in as Russell the equally foul mouthed and dirty gym teacher. Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis, bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. All in all, the casting of Bad Teacher is flawless and is really where the movie shines. The punchlines are delivered with punch and the characters are decently developed and complex in their own ways. There are some setbacks to Bad Teacher which stop it from being a great comedy. The plot devices used to move the story along are unconvincing and overplayed. Character transformations are equally unconvincing, uninspired, and rushed. Some scenes feel forced for the sake of cheap laughs or shock value. None of it though is shocking enough for this to be an effective method of comedy. Sometimes the characters feel a bit too weird even for the universe of strange the movie sets early on. Jason Segel's Russell is the most interesting character in the movie and yet for some reason is greatly underused. He pops up in pointless scenes simply to interject a laugh and then disappears for long stretches of time. Bad Teacher is a funny movie. The critics have not been so generous with their reviews, but who listens to them anymore anyways? If you are into dark comedies or a raunchy brand of humor, you will find yourself laughing with this one. While the plot devices are forced and some of the humor could have been better with a more subtle approach, overall this is a decent flick to chill out on the couch and laugh with. 7/10",Bad Teacher
135,scorfield-51711,Tagline: 'She doesn't give a F' - sums it all up.,2,6 April 2021,"If this film fails to make the grade it is largely down to an infantile script from a team of writers whose only notable achievement to date is the adaptation of 'The Office' for an American audience. Given that this writing parnership's previous cinematic outing was the lamentable 'Year One', on this evidence Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg would have had great difficulty gaining studio backing for their next venture had this feature not done so well at the box office due to the presence of Diaz and Timberlake in the cast.If the premise behind this movie had been in the hands of the Farrelly brothers there may have been the germination of a cult comedy. Unfortunately, the screenplay for this movie relies on pure mean-spirited cruelty, and profanity for profanity's sake rather than its use to accentuate comedic effect - although they did stop short of a scene whee Diaz casually drops the 'C-bomb' to refer to her rival for Timberlake's character's affections, much to the dismay of the actress who felt it was the best line in the picture. The only notable exception to the puerile use of cussing kept within the film is the gradual, and slightly humorous, reliance on expletives to grade the students' papers.The fact that the arc of the screenplay's development hinges on the audience being expected to root for Diaz's character, Elizabeth Halsey, when she has no obvious redeeming qualities, leaves the film dysfunctional from the outset. It is clear from the opening scenes that she has only invested time in her fiancé as a means to feather her own nest and escape the daily grind of having to make a living. Having no option but to return to her old employment as a school teacher, which she confesses she fell into because of 'shorter hours, summers off...no accountability', she regards her only full-time job as finding another rich man to provide her with the lifestyle she craves. Indeed, the closest she gets to motivating her students is to screen Michelle Pfeiffer's 'Dangerous Minds' while she sleeps with her feet up on the desk. To enhance her marital prospects she wishes to enhance her bust size and therein lies the plot for the movie as she displays no scruples in her desperate attempts to secure the finances for the required pricey boob-job.To be fair, the supporting cast, perform admirably with such sub-standard raw material. This is particularly the case with Jason Siegel, as the gym teacher 'coming onto' Halsey at every turn, with lines as infantile and outdated as 'can you hold my ball-sack?' Another worthy contribution is made by Phyllis Smith, from 'The Office', playing the wallflower fellow tutor, desperate to be as cool as Diaz's character. Then there is 'Modern Family's Eric Stonestreet, as our protagonist's weird flat-mate Kirk, making a hilarious contribution as the world's worst blackmail message deliverer. Even Timberlake does his best playing the nerdy newcomer to the staff room, and heir to a family fortune, Scott Delacorte, who becomes the target of Halsey's machinations to snag her next 'meal ticket'. Hats off to Timberlake for the unbearably lame track he wrote for his character to debut for the school teachers' band, 'Simpatico', which is one of the few belly-laughs of the film.The most notable contribution is that of Lucy Punch, who learnt her comedic talents under the auspices of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French in 'Let Them Eat Cake', as the repressed self-proclaimed defender of standards, adversary to Diaz's designs on Timberlake, and stooge for all Diaz's outrageous pranks. How gratifying to know that at Punch's behest the character of Miss Squirrel was based upon Sarah Palin. It is also incredibly disappointing to witness a performer with the comedic talent of John Michael Higgins, previously brought to light so well by the genius of Christopher Guest, and so under-exploited here.There are flickers of true entertainment, including the Car Wash fundraiser scene, the brutal use of basketballs for students producing wrong answers, and the framing of the local examiner for the state test, played really well by Thomas Lennon, which allows Halsey to win the teaching bonus for her students' best test performance. This reviewer's personal favourite is the shot of the open-mouthed, dead-behind-the-eyes student in Ms Squirrel's class. Yet, for every one of these fleeting moments of true hilarity, there are still the counter-weights of awkward vulgarity, such as the 'dry-humping' scene. One imagines that Diaz and Timberlake were only able to play such a scene given the fact that they dated each other for four years after meeting in 2003Following in his father's footsteps, and with a Golden Globe nomination earlier in his career, Jake Kasdan needs to show greater deliberation in what project to take on next. The only real draw here would have been to work with some bankable stars, as surely the limitations within the script would have been obvious. Indeed, Kasdan felt that securing Diaz in the principal role was essential for any chances of its success, believing that many audience members would particularly love seeing the actress playing out of character. As Kasdan sums up Elizabeth Halsey: 'She's a person with sort of tragically bad values and no inhibitions about letting them hang out.'Overall, the official trailer promised much, but contained all the best material, leaving the full movie quite a disappointment. It is still quite astonishing that this mediocre feature was able to spawn a TV serial. If there is any aspect of the movie which bears any redeemable quality it is the accompanying soundtrack, featuring the likes of Judas Priest and Coolio performing Gangsta's Paradise.",Bad Teacher
136,tgrock,Look at who the writers are of this movie. It will tell you the quality.,1,11 August 2011,"Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg are the credited writers of one of the worst comedies ever made: Year One, the movie where Jack Black and Michael Cera played themselves as cave men. Here the same type of mean, non-creative, only mildly entertaining humor is at play because they wrote Bad Teacher.Some may even say that this is a wasted opportunity with this cast. I beg to differ. You mainly have one ACTUALLY funny person in the cast and that's Jason Segel, which happens to provide the movie's only funny moments. All these other actors would never be capable of writing funny jokes in stand-up or in a movie. They are all just actors there to just read what is given in front of them, entrusting that the jokes in the movie are going to be funny. Unfortunately, not even that happens in this film.The humor in ""Bad Teacher"" mainly is about shock value only. The shock value here only comes off as repulsive and definitely not funny. Where is the wit in any of the lines? What are they expecting an adult reaction to be with some of the jokes in this. Someone farted really loudly on the toilet. Reaction that didn't happen: ""HAHAHA."" Or it shows a kid with an erection as Cameron Diaz washes a car. Reaction that didn't happen: ""OMG, did they really just show that?

137,facebook-124-955845,Bad Teacher = Bad Script,6,4 August 2011,"There have been many memorable acting performances in which teachers are portrayed: Edward J. Olmos as Jaime Escalante in Stand and Deliver; Michelle Pfeiffer as Louanne Johnson in Dangerous Minds; and Robin Williams as John Keating in Dead Poets Society just to name a few. Add Cameron Diaz as Elizabeth Halsey to that list. All four had a strong influence on their students; Escalante, Johnson and Keating were positive influences, whereas Halsey's influence is enough to make one question a school's hiring practice. She's lazy, disinterested in her students, and clearly has one goal in mindto find a rich a man that will take care of her. If that's not influencing your kid on how not to turn out, I don't know what is.The cast of Bad Teacher is terrific, from top to bottom. Cameron Diaz is a riot throughout the movie, whether she's being seductive, devious or a cold hearted bitch. Elizabeth Halsey is someone easy for her colleagues to dislike, but as a viewer I found myself rooting for her. Diaz appears to genuinely enjoy the role she's been cast in. Justin Timberlake looks and acts the part of a geek, which appeared to be the intended result. J.T. is a rising star in film, and with his good looks, charisma and talent is capable of standout performances in anything he does; I can't say that he's very memorable, but he is convincing in the part. I was unfamiliar with Lucy Punch, but thought she really held her own surrounded by a talented and experienced cast. The back and forth between Punch's Amy Squirrel, the 'good teacher', and Diaz's Halsey is extremely entertaining and is what drives the film. Jason Segal isn't in the movie very much, but when on screen he adds additional hilarity in a subdued way. Minor supporting roles played by John Michael Higgins and Phyllis Smith assist in drawing attention to the fun.The closest comparison to Bad Teacher I could think of was Bad Santa. The difference being that I felt Bad Santa was excessive in its use of profanities. There would be cursing when there just wasn't a reason or need for it. In Bad Teacher, the profanity and raunchiness were hysterical, regardless of how over the top. There's one particular scene that comes close, but it's done with purpose to further the story. There are easily going to be people who find this type of movie offensive or excessive. I'm just not one of them. I'm confident that with a weaker cast that Bad Teacher would have just been a bad movie.

Need I say more?This movie centers around a woman who gets dumped by her rich boyfriend and is forced to go back to teaching. She then manipulates, lies, and steals to raise money for a boob job, in hopes of attracting a new rich man to mooch off of.I like Cameron Diaz as an actress. After seeing this garbage, my opinion of her is now lower. How could she agree to play the part of such a horrible person? Normally, a movie's plot centers around the hero, and does its best to get you to hate the villain. Bad Teacher is exactly opposite, trying to get you to like the villain (Diaz) and hate on the people trying to stop her and her criminal ways. This doesn't work anyway, you immediately hate Diaz right from the beginning, and are shaking your head and cussing her all the way through.Now, I might be more forgiving had the writers tried to change her from a bad guy to a good guy. There was one small failed attempt at this. Otherwise, bad guy all the way through, and in the end, she gets away with everything! What a disappointment. And not once while watching this ""comedy"" did I so much as chuckle.",Bad Teacher
139,Dfschohr-532-549658,Bad Teacher Review,6,24 October 2013,"Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a beautiful, foul-mouthed, gold-digging teacher, whose wealthy fiancé has just broken of their engagement. Ms. Halsey is now stuck teaching the kids that she was trying so desperately hard to get away from. But when a substitute teacher by the name of Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) catches her attention, she sets off on a mission to gather enough money for her boob job. The film fails on multiple points, but also strikes with a lot of good laughs. The film is called ""Bad Teacher"" and it should have been called ""Mean Teacher"", because Diaz's character says and has inappropriate behavior, but she is not the mean spirited and heartless bitch of a teacher that I was hoping for. Justin Timberlake is fantastic. Im not a fan of his singing career, but I most certainly am a huge fan of his acting. His comedic timing is great in this film. There is one joke that is on his character's behalf and its a great part because it shows how weird he is, but I just wish they would have explained why his character was that way. Jason Segel is the stoner gym teacher who will stop at nothing until Elizabeth notices him. It felt like Segel was not in the film that much, but every time he came on screen, he killed it with his jokes. Jason Segel is one of my favorite actors/writer/comedian, and I can't wait to see his take on The Muppets. The film has great cameos from Thomas Lennon, Nat Faxon, John Michael Higgins, Molly Shannon, and Eric Stonestreet of ""Modern Family"" fame. This is definitely one of those films where all of the supporting cast gets all the great lines, while the main character falls short, and has all the stereotypical dialogue.Jake Kasden has directed some episodes of the cult classic ""Freak's & Geek's"", the entertaining and heart-felt film that is ""Orange County"" and the wildly hilarious ""Walk-Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. It is really disappointing when a director goes from making a couple of great films, and then adding an alright film in the mix. ""Bad Teacher"" is not a bad film, but it most certainly is not a classic. I give ""Bad Teacher"" a 6.5 out of 10",Bad Teacher

I thought she was more attractive than Cameron Diaz when she wasn't making a weird face (almost always). Did you ever go to a play where the actors all 'overacted?' This was how Lucy Punch spoke all of her lines. Maybe that was in the script, but I found it annoying (like I find most plays to be). I looked at her biography and she has over 50 credits, of which I have never seen any of (I don't watch TV much). Justin Timberlake fans: Sorry but his character is super Boring. Cameron Diaz fans: She did well with a bad script and definitely has a future in washing cars.",Bad Teacher
141,houndtang75,Not Bad,7,17 June 2011,"Bad Teacher, the title and theme of which seems to pay homage to Bad Santa, is one of the best comedies of the last couple of years. Not saying much I hear you cry and that's true but this is enjoyable from start to finish and Cameron Diaz proves herself an excellent comedienne. Also very good is the supporting cast particularly Lucy Punch as the relentlessly perky but somewhat creepy rival teacher Amy Squirrel. It would be intriguing to see a sequel featuring Amy bringing her own 'brand of zany energy to the disadvantaged students of Malcolm X High'. Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel also do a good job as potential suitors for Diaz's bimbo teacher.",Bad Teacher
142,lev-nemkin,Not as funny as I thought it would be but not bad at all...,6,16 June 2017,Watched this for the first time and it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it still wasn't bad I didn't really laugh out loud but I was kind of laughing on the inside Cameron Diaz as Elizabeth was really good she pulled off her character this gold-digging teacher who seemed to learn that money isn't everything in the end the whole movie she was raising money for breast implants which she didn't even end up getting there was also this gym teacher who kept going after her while she was trying to sink her claws into this other teacher who she knew was rich but after she realized money wasn't that important her and this gym teacher got together which was played by Jason Segel now that's another great actor very talented the whole movie she acted like he was beneath her just because he taught gym then she chose love over money which was a good choice and ended up as a guidance counselor at the school which I thought was cool but before that she was lying and cheating to get her way she cheated on the test of the students by getting the answers illegally to win a $5700 bonus that was the worst thing she did but before that she supervised a car wash that was meant to be for charity and took it for her breast implants another pretty bad thing too anyway if you're a fan of comedies or Cameron Diaz I say check it out I give it a 6/10.,Bad Teacher
143,roark183,Really Bad Film,1,30 June 2011,"I don't usually get this far off in judging a film before I go see it. I went to this film, because I thought Cameron Diaz could make it good. Wow, was I wrong. Ms. Diaz' acting is as bad as the rest of the film. She is a very good looking lady, but her acting is really poor and that is exemplified in this film.The script is really bad. The directing is really bad. The acting is really bad by all actors. This film has no redeeming qualities, unless one wants to simply see Ms. Diaz display her body. She does do that.Warning - There is pornography (not by Cameron Diaz) in this film. I didn't check the rating before seeing it, but the porno is there. One wonders why producers, directors and writers put that stuff in their films. Here it just further degrades an already really lousy film.",Bad Teacher
144,CSHaviland,"Bad Teacher, Worse Movie",5,30 June 2011,"A truly uninspired comedy with lackluster writing, weak plotting, and very little comedy. Apparently conceived to capitalize on the bathroom-humor fad, this entry by the makers of The Office should have gone through more rewrites, and perhaps -- dare I suggest it -- given to some other writers for some fresher comedy and character arcs that actually make sense. Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey who has no interest in teaching. When the movie opens, she's already been there a full year. I can't imagine how she made it through the first year without anyone realizing how horrible she was. She quits the job because she's found a rich boyfriend and is using him for his money, but her boyfriend's mother wises up and their pending wedding is canceled. So she must return to her dreaded job, and based on what we see on screen she's so incompetent that it seems ridiculous that the principal and the school board never notice. It would have been far more believable if she had been a new teacher who was forced into the role for some clever reason. Maybe she should have been trying to make moves on the principal, who became love blind and pulled strings to get her the position -- which she didn't want but needed to take in order to get something out of the principal she needed. She's a user in the extreme, superficial to the last, with no moral values that I can see. So it makes no sense for her to have ever pursued teaching as a career.Now, it is normal for characters to grow and transform as the story progresses. That is what story's are all about, in fact. But Halsey doesn't grow or transform at all. She only ""tries harder"" at teaching so that she can win a contest to get money to pay for a boob-job, which she believes she needs to attract another teacher who comes from a wealthy family. When her students seem to be failing to meet the standards she needs, she finds a way to steal the answers to the school tests so that she can train up her students on how to pass it (they don't show how she manages this). This plot works, but she is caught by another teacher. Does this teach her a lesson? No, she adds blackmail and other tricks to her list of crimes and wins that battle too. By the end of the movie she has not redeemed herself at all, and I had to wonder how these writers can consider themselves professionals.I'm giving the movie a 5, which is being nice. Cameron Diaz is too good for roles like this, she needs to choose more carefully.",Bad Teacher

146,scarletheels,Not the Funniest Comedy of 2011 but It Works,6,6 August 2011,"Gold-digger Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is forced back into the teaching position she despises after being dumped by her rich boyfriend. Instead of instructing the students and nurturing their young minds, she shows them movies like Lean On Me and Dangerous Minds while sneaking in sips of booze and cat napping at her desk. She hones in on Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a handsome substitute teacher who belongs to a family of considerable wealth but, to her dismay, he falls for the star teacher, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Intent on snagging herself another sugar daddy, she starts saving money for breast implants but her efforts to afford the $10,000 price tag aren't enough.After she learns the teacher whose class receives the highest state test scores is awarded a $5,700 bonus check, she starts making her students apply themselves but her aggressive teaching style yields nothing but bellyaching and malcontent. Determined to win the money, she poses as an investigative journalist following up on claims that the state exams discriminate against blacks and minorities, allowing her an the opportunity to steal the test questions from Carl Halabi (Thomas Lennon). The hostile rivalry between Elizabeth and Amy turns into full- scale war after Elizabeth's students scores are, not only the highest in the entire county but, enough to unseat Amy's three year victory.There are plenty of rotten pranks and downright nasty schemes that go on throughout the film, along with drinking and drugs, lots of swearing, an awkward dry-humping scene, and a pair of surgically enhanced breasts that will have men's eyes popping right out of their sockets. The humor is hit-and-miss but when it succeeds, it's shamefully funny. It's no comedic gem but it does satisfy a guilty pleasure to see Diaz play a greedy, thoughtless, conniving bitch. In Hollywood years, she's 'old' but, damn, she is looking better than ever and I give her props for flaunting what she's got in Bad Teacher.I loved Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel. Who is this woman who nailed the role of a well-intentioned but batshit crazy teacher so perfectly? She captured all of Amy's neurotic tendencies, exasperating competitiveness, nervous tics, and the smarmy smile that I kept hoping Elizabeth would knock right off of her face. Thumbs up to Jason Segel as Russell, the school gym teacher pining for Elizabeth, John Michael Higgins as the overwhelmed Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as reserved, mousy Lynn. The only person I didn't get was Justin Timberlake's character - he was just plain weird and dull.This was a mediocre comedy saved by its cast. There is a lot that doesn't make sense and you basically have to toss your morals to the wayside. Don't get too analytical. This movie is not an attack on the fine men and women who sacrifice salary for their passion to teach. It's a short-sighted, bawdy summertime flick that wants to tickle your funny bone, even if it doesn't always succeed.",Bad Teacher
147,devcybiko,Camron Diaz is still Hot,4,25 June 2011,"ONE LINE REVIEW: Camraon Diaz is still hot.RATING: Wait for the Instant Download, if you like Camron Diaz. Otherwise, Don't waste your time. (Ratings: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the Instant Download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")DANGER : SPOILERS (but no surprises)""Bad Teacher"" features Camron Diaz as Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher of some ill repute who just lost her sugar daddy fiancé and is trolling for her next victim. She finds him in Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who is a substitute teacher with well-to-do family connections. But getting in her way is goody-two-shoes teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) who has attracted his attentions. Elizabeth decides that to win the man over she needs breast augmentation surgery (costing $10,000) and will do whatever it takes to get the money. Meanwhile PE teacher Russell Getis (Jason Segel) has the hots for Elizabeth. And our little love triangles are complete.The basic premise of this movie is that Elizabeth Halsey is cool, and everyone else is a dork. Elizabeth smokes pot, and drinks, and lures men to their fate with her sex appeal.No, that's not true. That's the secondary premise of this movie. The basic premise of this movie is that Camron Diaz is still hot. And to prove it she was shot from every possible angle that you can shoot an actor. Long shots, two shots, sexual dry humping shots, and extreme close ups. She looked great in every scene. There is also a very seductive car wash scene.I think it takes a lot of balls to title a move with the word ""Bad"" in it. The reviews almost write themselves ""Bad Teacher is bad news. Badly Directed, Badly acted... blah blah blah"" The fact is that ""Bad Teacher"" is okay entertainment. This film is pretty juvenile in places and includes plenty of gross-out and fart humor. The best lines are already in the trailers.Elizabeth does a lot of bad things including seducing the head of the Illinois state testing organization to steal the answers to their standardized test. This enables her to ""teach to the test"" and win a cash award that allows her to get her boob-job. But don't worry, she never does.If this plot device of teaching the students to cheat sounds familiar, you are probably a South Park fan. See season 12, episode 5, ""Eek, A Penis!""The problem with this movie is that Elizabeth has no redeeming characteristics. She is so bad that we wonder why we care about her. But the film pulls it off because Camron Diaz is still hot. Also, every other character in the film is a dork, making her look exceedingly cool. Amy Squirrel (a sort of female Frank Burns) attempts to get Elizabeth fired and in so doing gets arrested herself. But she fails miserably in no small measure because Camron Diaz is still hot.Justin Timberlake does a good job of playing off-type as the dorky innocent substitute teacher. I liked Timberlake in ""The Social Network"" and here. He's not afraid of making fun of himself both in this film and in his occasional SNL appearances.In the end, this is a Hollywood feature and so the dorky PE teacher gets the hot bad girl in the end (no pun intended). And the transition of Elizabeth from superficial gold-digger to warm, caring gold-digger happens overnight and with relatively little on-screen impetus. But it's OK because Camron Diaz is still hot.",Bad Teacher
148,donjeffries,America Continues To Sink,1,26 June 2011,"Another comic ""gem"" to satisfy the cravings of an increasingly stupid viewing audience, ""Bad Teacher"" is accurately titled. Cameron Diaz, who is also a bad actress, is indeed very, very bad in this film. Her character is entirely absent any remotely positive traits. There's nothing to like about her, and yet we are supposed to root for her. A film with a title like this would once have been relegated to the porn industry. Now it's just part of mainstream ""comedy,"" right there alongside other immortal classics like ""Super Bad,"" ""Jack Ass,"" ""Kick Ass,"" etc.Yes, it was awe inspiring to watch dear Cameron fire balls at the heads of little boys. Not little girls, of course- that wouldn't be funny. It's only humorous to watch little boys in pain. Ha Ha. Think of it- the writers are depicting an adult abusing children, and we're laughing at it! Reverse the roles- can you imagine a ""comedy"" where a male teacher abuses little girls, and the audience is amused by it? Several obvious sequels spring to mind here; Bad Student, Bad Principal, Bad Janitor, Bad Cafeteria Lady, etc. The possibilities are endless. The American idiocracy apparently have an unlimited appetite for these mindless, immature ""comedies"" that could all have been written by 12 year old boys. I guess these ""writers"" never run out of ways to portray farting, male asses and men getting hurt (usually by getting hit in the crotch). Thank goodness their ""talent"" was recognized and is being put to such good use.Everyone who had anything to do with this monstrously bad movie should be ashamed of themselves. The messages it sends are horrendous. If ""bad teachers"" start popping up in real life, they should never be held accountable for their actions, no matter how despicable they are. After all, Hollywood has told us that such creatures are hilarious, even lovable. So lighten up, it's all in good fun!",Bad Teacher

I am really glad that I didn't pay good money to watch this movie on theater or even blu ray (downloaded it via Dish on demand). Cameron Diaz has acted in some bad movies but this I believe was most horrible. Story line didn't make any sense. Cameron's character changes towards the end but why does it change and does it really change. The movie was supposed to run because of Cameron Diaz but I don't think she has enough star power to carry this disaster on her shoulders.

Comedy movies should ALWAYS end up with a good end. I expected that Diaz will end by being a good person and confessing all her crimes including those against the good teacher who was unfairly accused by using drugs and was transferred to another school leaving her friends. I expected her to return that stolen glass dolphin statue and to give her students some real lessons. But who the a.....e who made up that end? Which comedy movie on earth would end up by the evil wins and the good pays the price? I can accept that in Action, Sci-Fi or Horror Thriller movies, but not in a comedy movie.

151,edenney01,"So bad, my daughter and I walked out after 20-25 mins",1,9 July 2011,"I can't write a complete review because for the first time in my life I actually got up and walked out of a movie, along with my adult daughter, because it was so bad. The movie was NOTHING like I expected based on the previews. I was expecting risqué, sexy and funny, and instead I got lewd, raunchy, and ANYTHING but funny. The couple slight chuckles I got in the first 20-25 minutes before we walked out, had nothing to do with the lewd, wildly misguided attempts at humor, but rather the subtle things like Cameron Diaz's character avoiding other teachers in the hall that are looking for a shoulder to cry on.I would liken the ATTEMPTS at humor in this movie to something like Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle... but unlike the mostly very funny White Castle movie, Bad Teacher misses the laugh mark by a MILE and then some. It's just simply NOT funny, and it was pretty awkward to watch with my OVER 17 daughter (you DEFINITELY don't want to take your teenage kids to see this). To sum it up, if you liked that disgusting Battle Sh*ts scene from White Castle, then Bad Teacher is YOUR movie, go see it. If you thought that scene was raunchy, lewd, disgusting, and NOT funny (unlike the rest of the movie), then AVOID Bad Teacher at all costs.

There was NOTHING likable about her. As a result, I could not connect at all. The gym teacher, Russell, was the only likable character in the entire film. He did not have enough camera time.

Unfortunately all movies must reflect some aspect of our culture in order to be successful, and the fact that this movie was even made I think reflects quite poorly on that culture.The lead character is a conniving, foul mouthed and shamelessly opportunistic gold digger that's been forced back into the classroom after being dumped by her rich boyfriend. She hates her job, her students and her co-workers and doesn't care who knows it, yet we're somehow supposed to root for her when she embezzles from a student car wash, smokes pot on school property and sleeps off hangovers in class. She wants a boob job in order to land a dorky but wealthy substitute teacher and resorts to theft, extortion, vandalism and outright felonies in order to raise the money to pay for it. Seriously dedicated teachers and parents are portrayed as clueless simpletons that she is able to dupe with relative ease.In the end she secures everything she sought by framing another teacher and destroying a budding romance, then decides she doesn't want it after all and walks away unscathed.

Diaz bludgeons the viewer with vulgarity and coarseness, and I admired the way she tears into her role. She has no redeeming qualities, yet I rooted for her. If you can surrender and allow yourself to be dragged into the muck, it's an enjoyable ride.The jokes come fast. Not all are funny, but enough of them score to keep things moving. The supporting performances are superb. There are many experienced comedic actors here adding funny bits with great timing. Timberlake had the weakest written part, but even he ripped off a few zingers. I probably got the biggest chuckles from the bits in the unrated version that were cut out of the theatrical cut.

Has all the earmarks of a character written into the script at, ah-hem, ""someone's"" request. His role as the love interest of two competing teachers could have been supplanted with a more believable competition for teacher-of the-year. The acting is not at all A-list quality, the plot is thin, and without anything going for it but crudeness, this film is totally passable.

162,marcusdestorm,Diaz still has that effect,10,25 February 2012,"Admittedly, when we heard that Cameron Diaz was to do a comedy film about an American school teacher, especially a film called ""Bad Teacher"", the thought was shadowed with Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bad Santa"". So where would Cameron Diaz pick up where Billy Bob left off? Having been a teacher for only a year at a local middle school, Elizabeth Halsey has plans of marrying Mark a wealthy businessman who suddenly gets information that his wife to be Elizabeth has been spending money like it's going out of fashion. For this he calls both their wedding and relationship off, but that is the least of Miss Halsey's problems – she is now homeless.Returning back to the school as a teacher Miss Halsey decides she needs time to evaluate her position and make every effort to make enough money for a boob job, so that she can attract the perfect wealthy man who will support her for the rest of her life. It is the in-between capers that this teacher gets up to which makes this movie work, as did ""Bad Santa"" with Billy Bob.Filled with a lot of off the wall jokes, hilarious undertones and side splitting tongue in cheek, up front and in your face humour; it will be ""Bad Teacher"" that puts ""Bad Santa"" into the minor category of a PG-13 Rating – and this is regardless of Billy Bob's colourful language.A warning may be needed for some viewers regarding this film as some scenes may cause spontaneous laughter and that of the occasional falling tear due to excessive comedic mastery put into the script.

I know it's only a film, but I am the sort of person who does not want to get to the end of a so-called comedy just to find that the message is that crime does pay.

Does she really bring enough box office?This movie is really bad and at the end I was very glad I did not go to the theaters to watch it. First of all, a comedy is about providing the audience with good laughs. I could not laugh at all, and I am not grumpy - I watched Friends with Benefits and Hangover II in the same week and although not superb comedies, they were way better than this!Anyhow, Cameron is way too old to play the teacher who gets money in the high school car wash activity. The movie is also a very bad example for teenagers who watched this - the bad teacher triumphs at the end and the good teacher is punished for possessing drugs that she does not own!One thing is to film a dark, politically incorrect comedy. A totally different thing is to make a movie with a terrible story and insert bad jokes randomly. Avoid!",Bad Teacher
170,vladtopliceanu,Maybe the best comedy film of the summer,9,1 January 2012,"First off I want to say that I am impressed with Justin Timberlake. He is one of my favourite singers, so before 2010 I would have never regarded him as something else other than that. But I see he is getting into film more and more. After minor roles he had a breakthrough performance in The Social Network in which he played one of the main roles. This year he started off with this movie and I can't wait to see Friends with Benefits and In Time. In this film I think he nailed his role. I can't even say how much I liked his performance in this film. I think he might have a bright future in this line of business.The concept of the film is silly, but I liked it. The movie was cute and funny, it was adorable. For this type of film I think you do not need that much of an experienced director but talented screenwriters that can offer us a funny and imaginative script. That is exactly what Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky gave us. I also liked the performance Cameron Diaz offered us. At first I was holding off on my opinion concerning her performance because she is actually one of the actresses I dislike. But bottom line her performance was pleasing. Who am I kidding? She was actually great in this movie. So with a cast that didn't look that strong to me, all of the main roles were interpreted in a good way, including those of Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel and Jason Segel as Russell Gettis, the other two main roles I didn't mention.For me this is one of the best comedy films of the summer.",Bad Teacher

172,TorontoLiver,Fair movie about exactly how NOT to teach,6,19 June 2013,"This movie Bad Teacher is not a great movie, but it's fairly enjoyable. Cameron Diaz gives a noteworthy performance but I found the other people gave average performances. This movie is about a woman named Elizabeth Halsey who is forced to take a career in teaching when her sugar-daddy boyfriend (Nat Faxon) dumps her. Elizabeth is an amoral, arrogant, hateful woman who clearly hates teaching. She cusses at her students, drinks heavily, and she smokes- marijuana! The reason why she took the job is because she wants to raise enough money to get a BOOB job! A real woman would not need to get a boob job. Besides Elizabeth, there is the very sweet and VERY annoying Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), another teacher, and the semi-antagonist who begins to hate Elizabeth when she finds out what she's doing. Amy is a beautiful optimist who enjoys teaching and speaking with her students while Elizabeth hates it. Elizabeth and Amy are complete opposites, which is one the plots of the movie. But deep down, REALLY deep down, Elizabeth does have a good heart but does a lousy job of showing it. Other people on this film include Jason Segel as Russell Gettis, a gym teacher who is smitten with Elizabeth, Justin Timberlake as Scott Delacorte, a substitute teacher whom Elizabeth likes, Phyllis Smith as Lynn Davies, Elizabeth's best friend and assistant, and many more. I really liked Jason Segel in this, just like I did in other movies, especially Knocked Up! He is a very funny man. This is a good movie, but it's definitely not for everyone. This movie, Bad Teacher is not really as funny as it could be, but there are still a few laughs in this. I enjoyed it. I liked Cameron better in The Mask, which is a better movie than this. Enjoy the movie, but just don't expect too much!",Bad Teacher

But it fails.The first hour is bad, OK it has some jokes and some good moments but you cant make a movie just of jokes.The acting is poorly. After watching Timberlake in The Social Network I thought he could be a great actor but this movie was a bad choice for him. Diaz tries to bring her career back but it doesn't work.Lucy Punch and Jason Segel are the best things of the movie. Segel is funny person but is wasted in the movie.

I knew when watching this movie for the first time it was going to be vulgar but that's okay because I'm 23 and I'm of age!Anyways, Cameron Diaz was Hilarious! She played the best I don't care about anything or Anyone kinda woman ever! She was a total obnoxious nightmare. She played it perfectly and I loved it! It was so funny, the whole movie was just so ridiculous and crude!

178,Moviefreak4653,"Maybe it caught me on a good day, but I really enjoyed it!",7,14 July 2011,"From the looks of the previews, Bad Teacher seemed to scream with mediocrity. It seemed like the kind of movie that looked funny, but ultimately would be just a headache of a time to watch. Would it be one of those movies that tried to pursue the persona of being this raunch fest with punchlines? They only go so far, and Bad Teacher looked like one of those movies where they showed all the funny parts in the previews. Still I was curious, and had no desire to be in a theater with children seeing Cars 2, so maybe this film caught me in a good mood, but I sort of enjoyed it.Bad Teacher is probably going to be one of those divided movies. You either really liked it, or didn't care too much for it. I won't deny, Bad Teacher works on some levels, and doesn't on other levels, but if you're enjoying the film the levels where it does succeed on, it sort of seems to just enhance the film more. Sure there are some scenes that seemed as if they were written specifically for a punch line, or that are completely unrealistic. Like I said though if you're enjoying the movie you sort of take it for what it is.The thing that makes Bad Teacher work for me, is how they cleverly avoid the cliché romantic movie formula, don't get me wrong the movie does have that, but it's not the main film. I absolutely loved how the mean and shallow characters stay that way for the entire film for the most part. I liked that a lot, and it made it much more entertaining to watch. Plus I loved how the bad guy (ironically the one the audience is intended to identify with) wins, and gets the devious satisfaction. For example there are no breakdown moments from the main characters who have had an epiphany or moment of redemption. The film does no stray into these characters who seem damaged, but humorously mocks them. Which is what brings me into how I love how this film has a dark sense of humor, that I think really caught the audience off. The kind of humor where you don't really know whether or not to laugh, like the kind of very cruel but funny jokes that make your mouth drop in shock. I love that kind of humor, and the audience I was with I don't think knew what hit them. That's where Bad Teacher to me stands out slightly above recent comedies who seem to pursue this goal of making raunchy comedies. Sure the film blatantly talks about sexual situations, and has a few gross out moments, but ultimately it is the film's dark and very quirky sense of humor.Okay there are tons of other movies I would recommend over Bad Teacher, and I don't mean to sound as if I'm over praising it. For certain subplots I felt to not be fully completed when faced with the ultimatum, and again on some levels the unreality of situations in the film is fine, but on other levels it seems to be a little annoying. Plus I felt Justin Timberlake's character to be very under written, and that should have been much more. Also the film does push the reality button, and pushes the audience into accepting what's going on. Like just how much you will be able to accept a character going to major extremes for some certain mission.Bad Teacher is a movie where you just accept what it is, and I enjoyed it nevertheless. Maybe thinking about it later I'll change my opinion on certain things, but as for now Bad Teacher did what every comedy should set out to do- make you laugh, and make you feel joyful in some way.",Bad Teacher
179,santosheflu,Entertaining as a gross comic affair!,8,9 September 2011,"Bad Teacher is real to watch. It is like American Pie, Lemon Popsickle, Uff Professor, etc, a little gross, a little cool, a little teasing. I am not claiming that it is a great comedy with great storyline. However, it is a great time-pass for a rainy day afternoon. You'll laugh and enjoy with your friends and may be a boy friend. Cameron Diaz is a good actor and she has something to offer in this movie. The supporting cast is more than average and sometimes excellent with cheesy situations in hand. The occasional jokes are the highlights of the movie though they are a little bitten. Nothing new about the movie but it makes you smile and offers some good entertainment.

180,reymond810,Bad Movie,2,11 October 2011,"Let me begin by saying that the producers must be hanged for approving such a film. Although it is built as a comedy, I saw no justification of that. At least the parodies try to make you laugh and occasionally succeed in doing so, but I do not think they made an honest attempt to make anyone laugh.There is nothing new in the film and the story, if at all there is any, is not given a chance to come out. There was only one character in this film, that of Cameron Diaz and she swung like a pendulum, never giving an identity to the character.The most disappointing factor was that, it seemed like the production team was unsure as to what kind of comedy they wanted to pursue in the film, it is still unclear if they meant it to be a blue comedy or black comedy.The acting was not convincing either. Nobody seemed interested in the film and it seemed obvious that all they wanted was to get the cheque and scoot. And now, all of a sudden parodies start seeming funny ... maybe it is a matter of perspective.THE VERDICT : Please do not watch it if you have a respect for comedy.",Bad Teacher
181,PittsburghFilmCritic,C Bad Teacher,6,17 October 2011,"The summer comedy, Bad Teacher, is filled with jokes – an number of which don't quite work, but when the film works, it gets some big laughs from the audience. Elizabeth Halsey, played by Cameron Diaz, is not a reluctant educator who wakes up to her gifts over the course of the film – she's selfish, stupid, and completely superficial. Her only goal in life is to get a boob job so she can attract a rich, attractive man – and if she needs to ""teach"" to earn the money, so be it. Although I generally don't care for Cameron Diaz, she does a fairly decent job in this role – her comedic timing is excellent, and she doesn't get too absorbed in the paper-thin plot to take the edge off of her character.The script by Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg is decent overall, but it didn't have a strong resolution – substantially weakening the movie. Fortunately, the large and talented cast including Lucy Punch, Jason Segel, Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins, and Dave ""Gruber"" Allen hold the shaky script together. All of them make the best of the material provided to them and Justin Timberlake delivers a shockingly impressive comedic performance.When everything is taken into account, Bad Teacher has strong acting and some great jokes, but the failed jokes and weak plot make it an average movie. It's entertaining, but not quite worth the ticket price, so it earns a ""C.""",Bad Teacher
182,silver808,"One of the funniest comedies in recent memory, truly funny.",10,30 May 2013,"Truly one of the funniest movies in recent memory. This comedy is one of the greats, it pulls no punches and has it all. It is very well written and the characters work very well and are full of themselves perfectly so. Cameron Diaz is amazing in this ultra scheming seductress role, and all the teacher characters are so well written and done, you know there is a perfect recipe for a very well written comedy that is so outrageous at times , yet really does work at what it is meant to deliver. For sure it is gross at times, the scene with Justin Timberlake is way beyond gross, but because of the character he is playing so well, it works and is funny. You will find this movie funny.",Bad Teacher
183,djp2000,Hot for teacher,6,23 June 2011,"Comedies today keep trying to push the boundaries more and more to stand out. The Hangover movies are a perfect example of this. Much of it started with There's Something About Mary which grossed people out in a humorous way. The star of that movie, Cameron Diaz, shows her funny side once again in Bad Teacher. This one's not as risqué or shocking, but it tries to stand out with its premise - a teacher who treats her students like crap and could care less about educating them. In most movies like The Hangover, guys are doing all of the crude and nasty stuff. So it's a little refreshing to see a woman do it this time around, even if it's more things she says than does. We do get to see her wail on some kids with a dodgeball though. You feel kind of bad for the kids, but they seem to take it in stride. Maybe they're just happy to have a hot teacher, even if she's not doing her job. Let's face it, most kids aren't excited to learn. Here they get to spend most of their time in the classroom watching movies. I know I would've preferred that when I was in class.Diaz plays money-seeking Elizabeth Halsey, a woman who somehow managed to become a teacher while waiting to marry her rich fiancé. She completes a year at her school doing the absolute bare minimum of teaching. But her fiancé dumps her after learning of her gold digging ways and now she finds herself stuck teaching at the school that she was just getting ready to leave for good. Elizabeth quickly learns that a new teacher played by Justin Timberlake comes from a very wealthy family. So she sets her radar on him as her next husband to be. He's the complete opposite of her, but that doesn't matter. He's very polite and rather nerdy. In fact, he's much more like Elizabeth's rival teacher Miss Squirrel. Once he starts getting close with the prissy Miss Squirrel, it becomes a battle of wits between the two women to be with him. But Elizabeth is out to get him for all the wrong reasons of course. While she sleeps through class and just plays movies for her students to watch, she spends the rest of her time trying to impress the wealthy new teacher and win him over. AdvertisementTimberlake, who's proved he can be very funny through all his appearances on Saturday Night Live, isn't really given much to do here. He just plays the clean-cut nerdy guy the best that he can. Jason Segal, who plays a fellow gym teacher, gets more of the laughs. His character sees right through Elizabeth but pursues her anyway. He goes along with everything she does but still makes sure to put her in check too. He's the one person at the school that she's able to relate to a little it seems. Watching the film you'll wonder if Elizabeth will find any sort of redemption and change her ways. You get the sense that Segal's character is the one person who can help her with that. The movie has some funny one-liners and interesting scenes, but I wouldn't say it's laugh-out-loud hilarious or anything. Still, it's a pretty funny premise and Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role. It's not a movie you'll remember down the road but it's worth checking out at least.",Bad Teacher

The only reason I made it all the way through was to see the Cameron Diez character get her just deserts. But alas, she never did, how disappointing. I agree with the other sane reviewers in that this is a statement of everything wrong with the world today. How can any normal human being see anything funny about this disaster. Bad teacher indeed, a soulless, conniving, lazy, sleazy self serving bitch. Here's a women whose only ambition in life is to get a big set of fake knockers and to score a rich man at any cost. She spares no ones feelings to get what she wants. The premise is that cheating, lying, and stealing are OK as long as you get what you want. Winners lose and losers win and be damned with normality. Here's the same basic plot line: Cold blooded killer kidnaps, torture's, rapes and then murders indiscriminately any man, women or child he runs into. Then successfully shifts blame to an innocent party who is put to death and then ends with the murderer being put in charge of the bureau of missing persons.

The acting is natural and sharp, and Diaz dominates not only with her looks, but also with cutting wit and dialogue that - looking at some of the more negative reviews - will perhaps appeal to a younger audience who can relate to some of the prissy characters that one bumps into in the real world, let alone a Hollywood comedy.A fun, fast-paced comedy, of course not to be taken seriously in any way, but well worth a look.",Bad Teacher

It's been suggested by some that reaction to it is generational, but I'm 77 years old and I thought it was great humor.Maybe some people are sensitive to using the public school environment as the basis for humor, that it's in poor taste, but given the state of the U.S. educational system it's hardly a sacred institution.The whole cast is excellent, comedy isn't ever easy but characters are created that are effective without being overdone, which is the common and fatal flaw of most comedy. You expect good performances from Jason Segel, Phyllis Smith, and Justin Timberlake, and Lucy Punch pulls off the role of Diaz's ditsy competitor very nicely, but for the movie to work Cameron Diaz has to do a comedy role convincingly and without exaggeration, and she does a great job.I kept waiting for it to fall apart somewhere along the way, but it didn't at all, another thing that's not easy to do with a plot like this.

In fact, the protagonist - Camron Diaz - does everything that you teach your children NOT to do: sex appeal, sabotage, extortion and outfight cheating
We have a lazy, good-for-nothing English teacher - Cameron Diaz - who finally gets her act together when she wants money for....breast implants?
Then she goes about everything that only makes sense to Hollywood and angry teenagers. She runs a charity car wash with her big, wet boobs. Then she keeps the money for herself? Isn't that for the unrepentant evil-doer?
She also steals a state exam by using false identification and drugging a bureaucrat, which is how people get blasted by news headlines then go to jail.
The teacher we should root for - Lucy Punch - is - of course - the badguy. She wants to do well in every way. Her only drawback is this somewhat annoying eccentricity.
Here, the good teacher sees all the wrong doings of the Bad Teacher, and wants to right the wrong. But the bad teacher foils her evidence, so the good teacher gets the punishment by a proper demotion to an assignment from hell. That's only after getting a bad case of poison ivy (thanks Cameron) and a sound public humiliation.
What's also enraging is the writers could just as easily have made Cameron Diaz see the light and work sincerely towards her goals. And the actual good teacher helps her.

You know who to root for and know what is the right thing to do. Boring.Here you just have fun if you let yourself relax.

From the reviews I have read on here the main problem seems to be the moral values in this film leading many ""oh so shocked"" viewers to give bad reviews, question people's sanity for producing this movie and hate everything about it - whether they admit it's the reason they dislike it or pretend to hate everything about an objectively well crafted film. But this movie is not supposed to teach anyone life lessons, it's not supposed to have some big, moral message about how to live your life in a good way. This is a film for adults. And films for adults do not have to follow certain morals because an adult is expected to judge morals on their own without needing guidelines. An adult can enjoy movies with main characters doing things they would never find acceptable because it's not about agreeing with the character's actions.Normally, I would rate this film 6 stars, but I rated it 8 to keep some of the irrational reviews on here from bringing the score down too far. It has solid jokes, a mostly good cast, OK direction but also some really bad moments and the main character goes completely out of character towards the end to achieve the usual Hollywood ""we need a kiss! FAST!!!"" Happy Ending, but overall a good comedy I would watch again with a great performance from Cameron Diaz.",Bad Teacher
199,mkenyon719,Give it a chance,9,26 November 2011,"I'm giving it a 9 to try and bring the score up because it's definitely not worth being that low.Bad Teacher is hilarious because you would NEVER see a teacher do these things and get away with it. The movie is low on morality!? So is just about every other comedy! It's NOT for kids, so don't let them watch it, plain and simple.Most movies do not make my mother laugh, and she was cracking up. I am studying to become a teacher and I loved this movie.Give it a chance, don't let the reviewers get you down. They're probably just a bunch of prudes. Rent it at the Red Box for a $1. A dollar won't kill you.I do have to say that Justin Timberlake's character was a bit stupid though....",Bad Teacher
200,ms-sharonfrancis,Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role,4,12 July 2011,"Diaz plays money-seeking Elizabeth Halsey, a woman who somehow managed to become a teacher while waiting to marry her rich fiancé. She completes a year at her school doing the absolute bare minimum of teaching. But her fiancé dumps her after learning of her gold digging ways and now she finds herself stuck teaching at the school that she was just getting ready to leave for good. Elizabeth quickly learns that a new teacher played by Justin Timberlake comes from a very wealthy family. So she sets her radar on him as her next husband to be. He's the complete opposite of her, but that doesn't matter. He's very polite and rather nerdy. In fact, he's much more like Elizabeth's rival teacher Miss Squirrel. Once he starts getting close with the prissy Miss Squirrel, it becomes a battle of wits between the two women to be with him. But Elizabeth is out to get him for all the wrong reasons of course. While she sleeps through class and just plays movies for her students to watch, she spends the rest of her time trying to impress the wealthy new teacher and win him over. AdvertisementTimberlake, who's proved he can be very funny through all his appearances on Saturday Night Live, isn't really given much to do here. He just plays the clean-cut nerdy guy the best that he can. Jason Segal, who plays a fellow gym teacher, gets more of the laughs. His character sees right through Elizabeth but pursues her anyway. He goes along with everything she does but still makes sure to put her in check too. He's the one person at the school that she's able to relate to a little it seems. Watching the film you'll wonder if Elizabeth will find any sort of redemption and change her ways. You get the sense that Segal's character is the one person who can help her with that. The movie has some funny one-liners and interesting scenes, but I wouldn't say it's laugh-out-loud hilarious or anything. Still, it's a pretty funny premise and Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role. It's not a movie you'll remember down the road but it's worth checking out at least.",Bad Teacher

Bad script, boring conversation, bad editing, the only worth compliment is Diaz who did a good job in performing a ""bad teacher"", however, the ending turned out to be surprising, or saying precisely, far fetching. The rock songs in the movie is the only one worth watching, however, why don't you just buy the CDs of Judas Priest or White Snake?? Removing the rock songs in the film, you can find that the original sound score is empty, just like the content of the movie.If you want to enjoy the joy of laughing, skip this one, because you wouldn't find laughter in this movie.",Bad Teacher

To be expected from Cameron as a more established comedic actress - but Justin - wow, he's really becoming a skillful comedian. And there's definitely chemistry and ease between those two in that scene.As a total movie, Bad Teacher has its predictable elements but I loved the casting. Cameron is spot-on as the rebel placed among the teachers whose most rebellious act is to sit at the back of the room at a staff meeting. Cameron and Justin are red hot and this is nicely balanced by the craziness of Justin's sympatico love interest. Definitely worth watching twice.",Bad Teacher
206,lyncorr,Bad Teacher - an understatement,5,24 September 2011,"This was a light, fun movie, however the message and plot was a bit twisted. Elizabeth Halsey (played by Cameron Diaz) was the proverbial bad teacher that tried any and everything to jump to the finish line and in the end she did. The only problem with this movie is what kind of message does it send to viewers after all the laughs are over? Is it that drug abuse, breaking the law and cheating are okay and you get rewarded in the end? The movie is about a teacher who starts teaching for all the wrong reasons – she doesn't take the children seriously and the only thing she is concerned about is making a quick buck to get a boob job. Her engagement is called off at the start of the movie when she runs up a 16 grand bill and her fiancé and his mother realizes that she is just interested in his money. She ends up having to go back to teaching and makes the kids watch movies for the entire class instead of following the syllabus. When she finds out there is a five grand bonus for the teacher whose kids gets the highest scores on the state test, she pulls out all the stops and goes back to the books. It is only then that the audience realizes that if she really applies herself she is not that bad a teacher after all. However, she realizes how little time she has and goes to great lengths to con her way into getting a copy of the test before it is administered.During the course of the movie she latches onto a new (nerdy) teacher Scott Delacorte (played by Timberlake) only because of the fact that his family has money. All the while she ignores the advances of the gym teacher who is really genuinely interested in her. Meanwhile another female teacher Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) is plotting against her to have her fired but it backfires each and every time and in the end she loses her boyfriend (Scott) and is accused of drug use when she purposely switches desks with Elizabeth. It ends with said teacher being transferred to a non-performing school and Scott now suddenly interested in Elizabeth. She turns him down and starts dating the gym teacher who transforms her into a better person and next fall she is promoted to Guidance Counselor. Of course she does not get the boob job in the end.I give this movie 5 stars.",Bad Teacher

The first review I read gave it 10 stars and said the only people who that won't like this are the cheerleader types because it portrays the ""RAH RAH"" charter in the work place negatively, Well, I'm not that type of person and the movie stunk. In fact the character portrayals were irrelevant because they were over exaggerated, not well thought out and couldn't be taken seriously at any level to be moved or offended. We've seen this movie 1000 times that takes several shocking sound bite scenes using language/behavior that they think is clever and edgy but in reality it's just old. It was poorly written and the only thing they had was Cameron as the headliner to make money. Unfortunately Cameron has only a couple movies at best left which is why she's cashing in when she can. All her movies are blending into the same character like in this movie and its getting old. We'll see!",Bad Teacher

It was entertaining and funny, but there was nothing that made it especially, well, special.I saw the trailer for the Channel 4 premiere, and I never miss a film if it's on TV for free. I watched it and had mixed feelings. I mean, it was rather funny, what with the whole 'bad teacher' and all, but they could have made it a lot better. For example, they could have included more aspects of a teacher's life, or more information on their personal life, instead of focusing on one thing the whole time. They could have made it a lot better if they had had more side stores and other dramas, like in all comedy movies (where the main character has a stress buildup, then has a breakdown).Comedy notwithstanding, the film overall was generally good- the actors were fantastic, the effects (if there were any) were flawless and the film was balanced.I would recommend this for a night in, maybe with some friends or family, on 'comedy night' or whatever other people do.",Bad Teacher

I thought the critics may have been overreacting, but they were absolutely right. This is the kind of movie one should watch when there is absolutely nothing else that one could do with his life. Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel did their job well, but Cameron Diaz didn't. I expected a stronger performance from her, and I wasn't convinced. I was just waiting for the movie to end and I don't think I'll ever watch it again in my life. The end wasn't clear and I didn't understand why did Cameron Diaz choose Jason Segel over Justin Timberlake at the end. The reasons why she did so weren't clear to us. I personally got the feeling that they reached a point where they just wanted to get over with the movie. Therefore, I recommend this movie for those who can find absolutely nothing to do with their lives. If you do, don't waste your time.",Bad Teacher

Ends up committing several felonies & getting a stuffy but honest co-worker blamed for everything (including drug use on school grounds) while she wins the day. The redemption is her hooking up with an angry gym teacher when he proves the affluent guy she's sharking for is a shallow imbecile.Now, I'm not the sort of person who demands a moral message in every piece of cinema, but really?

213,jbradleyclarke,A strong & positive message at the end,7,9 December 2011,"A lot or reviewers dislike this film for its surly incivility, and I think they do have a valid point of view. Cameron's character is reprehensible throughout the majority of the film, and the humor is often crass. Regardless, I think there are some fantastic scenes of humor. For example, the car wash scene in which Cameron sports a Daisy Duke outfit is hilarious: The distracted cop hitting cars, the acne-faced boy pleasuring himself, the fathers drooling over her. It is shamelessly shallow to be sure, but the scene is a great play on undeniable realities.I think the average reviewer is so overwhelmed by the dark side of Cameron's character that they fail to fully appreciate her transformation. Despite all of her deplorable behavior, Cameron's character discovers the value of helping kids. She reaches out to a girl regarding her parents' overly ambitious goals for her future. She also helps a young man come to grips with his social struggles and she helps him deal with the harsh realities of junior high student drama. She doesn't handle theses issues properly, but she does handle them effectively. Most importantly, these experiences transform her goals from gold-digging to helping people. She abandons her breast enhancement goals and she becomes a guidance counselor. She does indeed get away with committing all of her foul deeds without being punished, but she does become a better person. The film doesn't let us know Cameron's character will be a good guidance counselor or if she will adequately clean up her behavior, but I think she does learn the value of helping kids face their problems.",Bad Teacher
214,sinkthecity,Slowly gets better...,5,7 June 2012,"In all honesty, I felt the first two thirds of the film were shockingly dreadful, the humour was just irritating and the screenplay made the characters appear annoying. In all fairness, it did eventually get climatic towards the end of the film which obviously earned it a slightly better outcome than what it would've had if it had continued to be like the first half of the film. I think the most annoying factor of this mediocre film was that the terrible humour even made Jason Segel seem unfunny, and that just isn't right in my opinion as he's usually amazing in films working with better writers & directors such as Judd Apatow. This is film is only really worth watching if you literally have nothing else to watch. Don't waste your money buying it. Rent it at the most. That's all I have to say.",Bad Teacher
215,jukster,Bad Movie,3,15 July 2012,"None of these characters are likable. Not all movies have to contain likable characters, but cookie cutter Hollywood comedies do. Diaz's character is not likable even after the mandatory change for the better moment. Jason Segel's character is vaguely likable, but shallow. Phyllis Smith's character is lifter almost completely straight out of The Office. I wouldn't mind seeing her play someone who isn't bland and generic. The humour: Profanity seems to have replaced humour for most of the movie. The funny parts are all in the trailer. To be honest the trailer was funnier. Jason Segel's character Russell is probably the funniest and I attribute that to his delivery. He breaks up the stupidity. Timberlake not being able to sing has a subtlety to it that's quite good. His O face seems to be the funniest thing he actually did though.The story: The plot is interesting. Sort of like anti-Dangerous minds(which was hinted at some point). The thing is it's formulaic, which makes it boring and predictable. And what's with all the drugs everywhere? Seriously! Weed is fine I guess, up to a point. It's contrary to the main character's behaviour, but I guess she drinks and takes pills as well. A generic happy ending wraps this boring piece of mindless tripe up.Nothing else is really worth mentioning.

I work at a school similar to the one in the film, and it's obvious the writers never spent time in a secondary school as anything other than mediocre students. They know nothing of teacher characters or how they interact with students or each other, unless they think the scandalous headlines of child abuse and drug usage are the norm. Perhpaps that is what the writers were thinking while hoping everyone else was on the same soiled page.I found myself questioning why I found this film to be so unfunny and offensive while I quite enjoy raunchy comedic exercises like Get Him to the Greek and Celebrity Roasts. First, the latter don't involve children. Second, there is actual truth-wrapped-in-humor, not insulting the intelligence and often catching the viewer by surprise.

218,Lmader45,Could get your blood pumping. Mainly through violent outbursts.,3,11 July 2011,"The synopsis for Bad Teacher is as thus. A shallow, hot sociopath teacher is going to do whatever she can in order to afford a life changing boob job.The movie is really about two other things though.An attempt at crude jokes as Diaz competes with another teacher for Timberlake's affections.And eye candy.In regards to the former point, it fails heavily for many reasons.Firstly, the jokes aren't funny.Secondly, the characters are so annoying in this movie you want to punch every one of them in the face whenever they open their mouths.Thirdly, this hate stems from the characters being so nauseatingly unrealistic. Some may suggest they are meant to be annoying. But there is a vast difference between annoying and having a personality that the Dalai Lama would be driven to kill over.Fourthly, now because these characters are so unrealistic it means the story jumps around without making a lot of sense. While it doesn't take an average I.Q to keep up with the story, it's still blatantly obvious that scenes explaining events were ripped out to try to keep the movie flowing.The biggest failure on all these behalves is that the movie is not funny, the characters suck and no matter how much they cut the movie up, it's still around an hour to long.Now in regards to the sex appeal of this movie, I can't help.See, to me, since free and explicitly messed up internet porn became readily available of sexy women, who are also 20 years younger then Cameron Diaz, I have not gotten remotely excited at the idea of sitting through an hour and a half of bad jokes to see an attractive middle aged woman strut around in revealing clothing.Or a set of random boobs.But that's just me.Call me simple, or cheap, but when the only block between me and 1000 videos of XXX sexy teacher fantasies complete with corny one-liners and hard core scenes is a simple search engine, I fail to understand the 'pulling power' of a terrible movie with a hot woman who doesn't get naked.But each to their own.

I'm not one to bash people and for al I know she is still op notch but it seemed like throughout this whole movie she was trying too hard to get her character across. Far be it from me to single her out as Timberlake falls in the same category. Perhaps it was the directors fault for pushing the actors over the top but the whole thing came across contrived and feeling forced. I wish I had the ability to take back watching this movie but alas it is done and that time is gone from my life. Please don't watch this movie.",Bad Teacher
220,pymdnl,Painfully mediocre,5,5 August 2011,"In medias res this movie has no atmosphere at all. It could have been a fun mediocre flick, but its really not. Cameron Diaz ""plays"" an anti hero, but she clearly bad for this kind of role. I mean she isn't even likable, a bit. I felt more sorry for the bad guy. Yeah, I felt more sorry for the comic relief, and also the bad guy Amy Squirrel, for almost the entire movie. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly okay, (but what the hell was that ""sex with clothes on"" scene? It was beyond weird.) Jason Segel was the major deciding point to watch the movie, but he isn't in it really that much, and his scenes in the trailer, which He calls a student ""Twilight"", not actually in the movie, it was just shot to drew attention...I hate that. I cant believe that i am saying this but Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel was the best actor in this movie. Except at the end, she really goes over the top. But she freak outs were funny, and she was smart and edgy. I don't know how could i like Cameron Diaz in this, there is nothing likable in her (except in the very end of the movie). She is a bitch, cares about nothing but its money and her tits transplant (yeah its a major plot point, to get her breasts bigger,brilliant). The kid actors were just terrible, there were a lot of plot holes (like what the hell kind of teacher she is? I don't know what is she teaching, in a brief clip they show us that she is teaching to kill a mockingbird, so i guess she is an English teacher...I guess..., and what change her mind about helping students, and giving up on the rich guy? Nothing.). The editing was horrible, they used a clip like 3-4 times when a kid is surprised that his mouth is open (Its not even a good shot). This movie is not worth watching, maybe once.

After watching the movie, clearly, they were not my friends.The movie goes from bad to worse and continues in free fall throughout the one hour and 32 minutes of its duration (which by my count, is far too much). I have NEVER seen such a ridiculous plot being made into a movie, hats off to Jake Kasdan for the courage, and the audacity to make this.Without going into spoilers, the movie boasts of one terrible, pathetic (read: bitch) protagonist who has to make a fresh start as a middle school teacher, and then does everything wrong to earn a potload of money. One ridiculous attempt after another, the movie tries every trick in the book that a teacher might use to make money, and clumsily glues them all together. All the while, the good teachers try to befriend her, and she keeps on taking advantage of them.Worst of all, the movie portrays the nice in such a negative life, that it is actually a serious concern, if the trend is carried on. Wake up Hollywood, we don't like good people being ripped off! And lo and behold, the bad teacher suddenly turns good (Really? I was shocked! What an unpredictable plot twist). Would it kill you to at least give ONE reason behind this miraculous transformation.Cameron Diaz tries her best to portray the cold bitch, with success, but with such a terrible plot, it's hard to applaud. The co-stars do have their moments (if only far apart). The music and cinematography was dull, the editing botched at best and the visuals - glum (if not for a few shots like the car wash and a portion of the trip)Here's to an hour and half of my life that i am never getting back, though I tried my best to redeem my warning others about it.Tip: If you hate someone, there's no better revenge than making them sit through this movie",Bad Teacher

Humor was cheap, script was not original at all and screenplay didn't develop at all. Sometimes the main character is a bad guy/girl but you feel sympathy and develop an emotional connection. Cameron's character was nothing of that kind.The movie is all about her gathering money for plastic surgery of breast. She thinks that she will get any man with big boobs. Crap! She smokes, cheats, hurts people on the way of reaching her goals. You hate her throughout the movie because she is a b***h. But she gets a guy in the end. I give the movie 1 out of 10.

223,razitar,One of the worst movies I've seen since long,1,30 August 2012,"I wanted to watch this movie because I got the impression that it could be a new kind of ""High School Rock"" or something similar. Simply a ""bad"" teacher who discovers that she really wants to do something good for her students and actually helps them in getting good grades and self-esteem. But unfortunately, there is NOTHING of that in that movie!I don't even know how to begin my review of how bad this movie is. The only good thing about it is the cast: Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Jason Segal, Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith... This movie almost SCREAMS for wanting to be a big funny comedy! The cast, including Diaz, is doing an amazing job fitting their roles. Especially Timberlake, who is showing a rather odd kind of roll as the hot hipster new age idiot. But nonetheless, all their effort doesn't save this movie from falling on its knees. Because this movie gets nothing right. The jokes are harsh, nasty, dirty and political incorrect. Some may find them interesting and funny because of that fact. I just find them typically MTV-generation bad. The story and the pace in which the film develops are horrible too! It starts out by introducing how ""bad"" of a teacher Diaz is. She clearly shows that she has no interest in her students and their future, lets them watch only movies each day and forces them to do national tests without them having learned anything. And when the students fail (of course), she yells and threatens them to do a better job. And what's more, because threats don't work either, she lets them stand in line at the gymnasium and throws basketballs at each kids face if the kid doesn't answer correctly to one of her questions. Seriously?? What is this movie telling us? That the education system in the US is messed up or that you can teach students better with corporal punishment? All that attitude is so unrealistic, you wonder how she got her teachers' license in the first place.But sadly, Diaz is never getting away from her attitude. She is never really growing or changing in that movie. She sleeps, drinks, smokes, steals, takes drugs, is violent, cynical, lies and betrays all people around her. And gets always away with it. Right from the beginning of the movie until the end. What's worse, she even gets a colleague of hers to be forced to move to another school AND gets the guy in the end who was chasing her through the movie the entire time. Wonder what he sees in her?There are only two scenes in the movie where you think that Diaz finally will change, or at least show her ""real"" nice self. The first one is when she is smoking pod in her car and one of her students is giving her home baked cookies. For the brink of a second, Diaz is softening up and gives her student the advice to loosen up a little (""stop acting like you're racing for congress""). But she immediately finishes with ""You're hopeless, kid."" The other scene is after one of the boys in her class openly confesses his love to his crush, gets rejected and runs away in his misery. Diaz chases him, and when they finally sit down to talk about what happened, she repeats herself: ""I told you so many times, a guy like you will NEVER get a girl like her. Take that ugly hat off your face!""I became so frustrated by those small moments when it seems like Diaz finally will show us her nice self, only to prove once more what kind of a sad and mean psycho she really is. This movie gives you nothing and is not rewarding to watch in any way. You will get no interesting story, no plot twists, no philosophical depth, no moral message, no happy ending. It's really one of these movies where you have to ask yourself how the script got past the producing rights in the first place. I can simply not recommend this movie to anyone.",Bad Teacher
224,triganomix,Surprisingly good performance by Diaz saves poor script,5,2 August 2011,"This was the opposite to what I expected. I was pleasantly surprised by Diaz's character, 'Elizabeth Halsey' being a money scrounging, pot smoking gold digger who has no regard for anyone but herself and will back-stab anyone to get it using whatever resources available........mainly her body. She was really taken out of her comfort zone with this one (similar to Jennifer Aniston in Horrible Bosses). This is probably the strongest performance I have seen from her to date.Probably just as well as the majority of the script content was pretty shocking. It really did drag for large parts. Throw Justin Timberlake into the mix and you'd think That would spice things up. However although I love how he plays himself up, large chunks of his input were pretty boring and he does not feature as prodominately as you would expect. Don't get me wrong I actually rate him as an actor but they could have made a lot more from his character.Jason Segel is very good as Russell the, 'Gym Teacher' who has a subtle but solid input throughout the film. He provides some much needed laughs when things start to dull down.The fringe characters (rival teacher, friendly teacher and the ridiculous school principle) are all worthy cast members but again suffer from lack of content at times.Look out for the small but brilliant performance from Thomas Lennon who it seems has a natural knack to deliver comedic lines flawlessly. In summary, it is worth watching for the laugh out loud moments although they are few and far between. Generally strong performances with the script available but I would have expected better content from,Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg.",Bad Teacher
225,tcnee,Cute and Funny - Worth it,7,13 November 2011,"I like Diaz, and she shined in this.I had low expectations but it actually was funny. It had a good pace and threw a love story in there too. Even my husband thought it was funny, and he isn't into chick flicks! Unlike some movies where I have to fast forward through slow sections- no such problem here. The writers do a good job of character development with Diaz's part while keeping it light and funny.Don't remember much about the other actors except the other female school teacher - they played off each other very well.Good rental!",Bad Teacher
226,Niek-Ross,Bad teacher,4,15 January 2012,"The movie is about the miserable life of a money horny women, only out to marry rich people and life from their money. The movie is based around a stigma of bad influences, this time with a 'teacher' in the main role.Drugs, alcohol, hangovers. You are starting to think that the makers thought to score point while lifting on the back of 'The Hangover'. 'Add some good names and the movie will sell itself' they must have thought. Well , I've seen better movies with Cameron and Justin, this one is absolutely bad. But its so bad that it keeps you watching till the end and it made me wonder why? Probably because I wanted to know what more they could throw in that I've already seen in so many other comedies. 'If it was funny before, it will be funny again, and again, and again?..' until you see it once to many, which happened here.The only funny part was where Scott was dry humping, that was surprising.No I would not advise to movie if you are looking for a good comedy or a night with humor.

Not very funny, maybe laughed once. Getting really tired of these movies that are basically trying to get laughs by being vulgar. You know there are other ways to get people to laugh. Cameron Diaz plays the part fine. Although she has done much better and i think she can find better movies to act in. The guy (don't know who he is) was alright, but his part was not very believable. I felt like i kept watching the movie thinking it would get better, well it didn't. It was just kind of bland.",Bad Teacher
228,coolness5520,"""Bad Teacher"" wasn't bad enough",5,1 July 2011,"""Bad Teacher"" kinda threw me for a loop. As comedies go, it truly wasn't that bad. I got a few laughs out of it, but really nothing more. And there's the problem, I needed more.The film seemed to want to exist in a similar realm as that of the far superior film, ""Bridesmaids"", but it simply isn't good enough. There are a few problems holding it back, the first of which is the absence of the big laugh. There isn't a single moment in this film that pushed the audience over the edge. The movie didn't go far enough, primarily in two key areas, the film wasn't crass enough, and it didn't have enough heart.First problem is with the casting of Cameron Diaz. I'm sure she's a lovely women and it seems as if she's having the time of her life being insulting and rude, but perhaps that's the problem. Underneath all the insults and the drug use, is still America's sweetheart, acting like a middle schooler, who thinks all it takes to act grown up is to drop a few f-bombs.It's not that Diaz isn't funny, she is, for the most part. It's just that her jokes(whether they were written or she improvised) lacked a punch that a more experienced comedic actress could've provided. Granted the shock value of seeing Cameron Diaz in such a role would have been lost, but perhaps the final product would have been more satisfying.But also lost is a depth of character usually found in these kind of films. Since ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" audiences have been expecting a dose of heart with their crude humor, and while an attempt is made at redemption for the main character in this film, her intentions are so vain, and her actions so selfish, that in the end the character arc falls flat, and by the end of the film I just didn't feel like rooting for anyone.So is ""Bad Teacher"" a successful comedy? Did it make me laugh? Yes, but this film just barely reaches average, which makes it a huge disappointment. I wanted to like ""Bad Teacher"", I'm a sucker for Judd Apatow films, and the countless copycats that have emulated that formula ever since ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" came out. But ""Bad Teacher"" didn't go far enough, and that has to be the biggest disappointment of all.",Bad Teacher

Great comedy well played by Miss Diaz! And Justin Timberlake playing against type was great too. Every time I watch it I smile and laugh and thats what its all about. I was reminded of another fave Heartbreakers with its bawdy over the top humor. Funny part? Her coming into house and saying ""im going to ..."" and his parents being there. Funny part? Cameron not being able to get high and then banging on liquor store not knowing closed for holiday. Funny part?

The plot line may be predictable but the humour is anything but.If you like Cameron Diaz, Jason Segal and Timberlake (and I do, and you should) then trust them, trust me: ignore the low score that comes from a lot of people expecting something cutesy and tame.

234,kambizs,Bad teacher; The experience of an empty bottle,1,23 March 2014,"A comedy centered around a foul-mouthed, junior high teacher who, after being dumped by her sugar daddy, begins to woo a colleague -- a move that pits her against a well-loved teacher. (IMDb) The story has been structured weakly. The main character is a teacher (Elizabeth\ Cameron Diaz), that uses marijuana, cheats in the exams, lies, and extorts steals. The first description above has written in IMDb that makes this movie like an challenge against the rules in society. But question is; this movie can be in this field? My question strongly is NO. We face with a character that has no psychological integrity. Character hasn't been defined properly. Seems the teacher supposed to be a positive person but truth is she is not and has no right to harm others but she does. She is teacher in a school that nobody cares what's going on. Also parents don't consider the value of education for their children. Despite these kinds of behaviors, she is a hero in this movie. She is a teacher who cares about students, and also she cares about the school. Writer for being sure this movies has no way to survive, plans this character like an idiot. All of the characters are stupid except Elizabeth that she can do everything but nobody can arrest her. She lives in a city full of idiots. All of the characters (except her) are passive. Actually seems this movie has just one character and writers (Gene Stupnisky & Lee Eisenberg), just added others too show that somebody else are living in this town but they have nothing to do to push forward the story. Jake Kasdan (October 28, 1974) also has used all his efforts to make sure that film will have weaknesses much more than script. These are included the play of casts, decoupage, editing and etc., which are reason that film doesn't proceed. Inert and motionless characteristic of the movie has overshadowed on the entire film. Watching this movie was like having an empty bottle of beer exactly when I am so thirsty. This kind of movies sometimes reminds me a big question; really has finished the age of great Comedies in the world?",Bad Teacher

236,nykm,Don't turn her into good guy if you want to make a bad guy win movie,6,22 August 2012,"This is an unorthodox school / teenage / teachers movies NOT FOR KIDS. A lot of foul language and we have a teacher who was looking around to marry a rich guy. To cut it short, a gold-digger. The protagonist or may be antagonist for 3 quarters of the show, Elizabeth Halsey, played excellently by an old, ugly, way off her prime, Cameron Diaz. Which is why I understood totally new arrival teacher cheesy rich kid Scott (by Justin Timberlake) totally put her aside for her colleague, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), an enthusiastic, dedicated and certainly has a bigger bust young teacher. It's simple, we have a twisted and evil woman, who was street smart enough to bend the rule and even go to the extreme (even broke the law) to achieve her goal, which ironically turn out to be just collecting a mere 10K for her boobs jobs. A goal which she believe will enhance her chances to dig a goldmine.Well, the only bad part of the movie, the last 15 minutes or so, where out of nowhere, the filmmaker decide she would have this sudden self-awareness of being shallow and superficial all the while and turn her, ultimately, into a better person. Honestly, I would have gave the movie a 7 or even 8, had they decide to stick her to continue shallow and EVIL (but in an idiotic way). Though that will make it looked like ""Talented Ms. Ripley"" in second thought. OK, may be let her learn some hard lesson. May be the guy Russell (played by Marshall from HIMYM) who always has crush on her, whom in the movie she choose her over Scott (because she decide to turn FACE, lame!) turned out to be some Paul Allen (or his son) and he passed her out when she realized it a little too late.Good pacing, solid scripting, some funny moment here and there, OK acting, basically a GOOD WEEKEND movie in modern day term.

The pace of the film is pretty steady and makes it's audience curious as to what is gonna happen next. There is some unnecessary lookin' sexual references and scenes that although I don't have any problems with them, they could've been portrayed in a much better and even funnier way. I think one of the main characteristics of a movie is whether it has scenes or dialog that you'll remember a few years from now and this film has got'em. Not many of them though! The film has two good looking actresses that add to the charm of the film.

I'm not a Justin Timberlake hater or anything, but he is just not a good actor...not in this type of role. I think he tries to hard to be funny, and he comes off cheesy and over-the-top. ""Funny"" doesn't come naturally to him, and to be truly funny, it has to seem effortless. For him, it is hard to watch. Cameron Diaz embodied her character and played the role well. Jason Segal was amazing as always. They should have played up his role a bit more and tuned down Justin Timberlake (or cast someone else to play the role).

I did not know much of her until this film, but she's got great comic chops! She captures every nuance of the meddling, officious, pandering sheep out there. Her comic timing is right on in every way--particularly her cheerful covering up every time she realizes Elizabeth has once again bested her.

In this raunchy Rom-Com the acting tends to be somewhat lacking however witty dialogue, mostly supplied by the Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz characters, saved this film from being an entire flop. The blatant disregard for any kind of class left this movie raunchier than expected and somewhat distasteful. However when the awkward moments passed and the viewer wasn't constantly hating the prissy teacher Miss Squirrel for her annoyingly upbeat can-do attitude, the comedic writing left nothing to be desired in the appropriate moments albeit far between they were.

I adored Diaz and Timberlake because they were having fun, they got to let lose and have a role that fits like a normal person. Or a normal, slacker person.The word play and various satirical remarks on society and education various habits of teenagers are pretty funny. What gets me most about this is that the laugh factor doesn't go away at all. It's a cult classic I think for anyone who teaches or is in higher education as a living to laugh off what so few people actually do.The thing is movie ratings exist for a reason, if people have issues with drug use and vulgarity you don't have to watch it, this movie had a set audience and has a lot of redeeming moments despite the cynicism in the film.

And those were her good points! Inevitably, her character transforms, although - thankfully - she never loses her sass, her love of life, nor - it must be said - her love of wanton sex. In short, she keeps the pumps and gains a soul.In the interim, her unique depiction of the classic ""the-way-to-the-top-is-to-sabotage-my-competition"" mindset that has so many well-groomed adherents in western middle management culture, struck a few chords, and I must say, healed some wounds.

She pulls off the recently dumped, vulgar, Junior High teacher off pretty well.Diaz stars as the titular teacher Elizabeth Halsey. Her fiancé dumps her very early on in an unexpected tone setting scene. She is an educator without a care of education who needs a new man's bank account to rest on. Enter Justin Timberlake as the hot, new substitute teacher with plenty of family money. Timberlake plays the dorky, yet hot teacher very well culminating in his facial expressions in a ""moment of pleasure"".Jason Segel guest stars as the slacker gym teach with intent to hook up with the vulnerable Diaz. Segel albeit funny is under utilized in this smart, well written comedy. Lucy Punch is hilarious as the perky, over the top model teacher also vying for Timberlake's attention.The film is a comedy that should succeed much better than anyone whose ever heard of Cameron Diaz would expect.

257,Jasee_1971,Bad Teacher: Simply Misunderstood and Judged,8,21 December 2014,"Let me start by saying that this is the First time I ever write a review – let me repeat: my first review ever! What has led me to write a review on Bad Teacher is very simple. I love it, love it, and love it some more. What's not to love about it? Before I delve into the characters allow me to say this much. The audience have judged the film, forgetting the sheer hard truth: it is a movie folks, nothing more nothing less. It has been made for pure entertainment – and of course it is Rated R. You are not supposed to show children the movie with the objective of teaching them the morals of education, educators, students and everything in-between. I have read most reviews and the feeling I gathered was that people are upset of how Bad Teacher depicts how ""being a lazy, unethical teacher"" well appears cool and trendy. And as if the movie makers were sanctioning some ""bad behavior"" from teachers. Well on that standard, we would have to write bad reviews about many, many, and many other movies. Such as the movies that glorify murder, or bank robberies and so on. There are countless movies out there that make murder and torture OK. I'm sure there's many. But what does come to my mind now is ""Entrapment"" where Catherine Zeta Jones & Sean Connery organize and succeed at robbing major banks, jewels and well whatever. Eventually Jones gets away from stealing from the World Bank in Indonesia during the millennium, like 7billion dollars or more. What about Stallone in Rambo, Cruise in Mission Impossible, Gibson, in lethal weapon? Don't all these movies grant excuses for the murder of people? The list goes on..The bottom line is, Bad Teacher is funny, entertaining and above all it has heart. Yes indeed, Diaz shows a lot of heart for her students and helps one particular student who is in desperate need. He is mocked by his fellow students for behaving like a dork, yes the way she helps him is somewhat dishonest but don't they say that the end justifies the means? Diaz does a superb job in my opinion. Let's not forget Timberlake, who is so into character that you in fact forget that this is the very cool Timberlake. People, please, I must have seen this film at least ten times and I'm ready to watch it 100 more times, enjoy it, and enjoy it for what it is. Be entertained, it's a film, not a book that is supposed be on your children's curricula in year 10.Of course we are all different and have different tastes – I personally don't enjoy horror and western films.

Some of it is very funny and it's far better than some other recent comedies, such as The Dilemma, which has to be the worst comedy I've seen this year. Jason Segel was good in his role even though he doesn't have a whole lot of screen time.Unfortunately, there were several scenes and lines that seemed out of place and some of the film felt kinda dis-jointed. The plot was pretty thin and the first half of movie was more like watching a series of loosely-linked scenes rather than a proper film.That said, it's still pretty funny and I'd recommend it if you liked similar movies, but you're probably just best waiting for the DVD unless you really want to see the film, then go to the cinema.I give Bad Teacher 8/10; I know it's being pretty generous considering what I've said about the film, although I'd much rather watch this again than the likes of The Dilemma or Hall Pass.",Bad Teacher
262,durandma,A fun movie,8,25 July 2011,"This movie may not be the best film I have ever seen or even close to it but it was a very enjoyable comedy. Some seem to have been disappointed with this film but I'm not sure what they must have expected after seeing the trailers. If you are looking for something to get your mind off things for an hour and a half and get some laughs, this is a pleasant way to do it.One warning though. While it is by far not the raunchiest movie I've seen, in my opinion, this is not a movie for little kids or even young teenagers. There is some drug use that the film could have certainly done without and it has some definite adult humor.",Bad Teacher
263,jack_brady5,Pretty Poor.,5,17 June 2011,"First of all Cameron diaz played this stereotype well, blonde with blue eyes being a money grabbing slut? Who would have thought it.The film itself had a plot which, in my opinion, did not really reach a peak to get me engrossed in the film. It was really one sexual innuendo or connotation after another which I found boring, repetitive and predictable after the first few. This was reflected in the audiences reactions in the cinema which were fairly muted throughout apart from some scenes, mainly the toilet scene, the kid with the boner at the car wash and the dig at the Japanese kid.The film was desperate for laughs and reverted to attempted toilet humour to get laughs.A below average film and one i wouldn't recommend seeing. However Cameron Diaz is in very good form which is a positive take from this film.",Bad Teacher
264,katepadilla,Bad. So very bad.,1,28 June 2011,"This review is copied directly from my blog: Good.Bad.Ordinary (http://goodbadordinary.wordpress.com) From the trailer, this movie looked pretty funny. Not the least bit intellectual, but funny. And last Sunday afternoon, I needed to get out of the apartment, so my husband and I decided to try out a new theater and check out the movie.Bad. Oh so very bad. For starters, we're those people who bring their own food into a movie. I usually try to stick to the safety of chips/candy/snacks, but my husband has been known to sneak an entire steak dinner into a show. We got our Chipotle to go, stuffed it in my purse, and walked into the lobby.We should have known when we walked in that this was not the sort of theater one brings their own dinner into. The price options? $15 for a regular seat, $22 for the premium. This is high even for Austin.The regular seats inhabited only the first three rows of the theater, and still consisted of leather armchairs with an attached personal concession tray. (The premium seats, in case you were interested, were suede chairs and came with free popcorn and your own personal concession service.) So, we're already feeling awkward just sitting in the theater, which ended up being great because the entire movie was awkward anyway. Every unnecessary sexual exploitation was noted, and blown out of proportion, every combination of profanities shouted to great exuberance, and the plot seemed to exist only as a means of furthering the whole ordeal.With that in mind, I use the word plot very generously. Usually, in a movie of any worth whatsoever, there is a climax (No, we're not talking about that scene, but rest assured that there was one and that it was uncomfortable to watch). Elizabeth Halsey, played by Cameron Diaz, returns to teaching because she needs new boobs and her uber-rich fiancé a) broke up with her for being a gold-digger and b) refuses to pay for said boobs after their relationship ended. She manipulates her way into every penny the after-school programs raise, and keeps a fishbowl for the random singles she manages to squeeze out of anywhere else.This is the driving plot, yet it is not resolved. In the ""falling action"", if you can call it that, she simply decides to not get the surgery. She's already made the appointment, and she's already paid the cash. Did she get a refund? What did she do with the money.As exampled by the previous two paragraphs, not a single thread of story was ever resolved. She wanted the cute rich substitute teacher? She got him, rubbed it his girlfriend's face, then decided that he was too weird for her. She did drugs on the side? Ms. Squirrel (also the substitute's girlfriend) switches the desks in an attempt to find out the truth. Instead of getting the misfortune she undoubtedly deserves, Ms. Halsey switches the blame and ends up getting that other teacher in trouble for the drugs (after all, the contaminated desk was now in her classroom) and sent to the most inner city of schools to teach.And at the very end of the whole show, there's a kiss scene. Just one, between Halsey and the gym teacher, played by Jason Segel. This is placed here, I'm confident, so the directors can say, ""See? She's not a total lost cause. She did end up falling for the not-as-rich guy."" And, because I'm such a huge Segel fan, I loved his character. However, in retrospect, what I probably loved most was the way it was acted, not the character itself.So, all in all, not the greatest experience of my life. But we left the theater, drove home, and curled up to The Glee Project, which made everything better.",Bad Teacher

Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I Love You Man. And I like Phyllis Smith from The Office. I have seen Segel and Diaz making the rounds promoting the film and it looked like a fun Friday night date movie. Lettermen was raving about it so I went to see it. I was praying to the movie gods to not this be another ""Every funny thing in the movie was thrown into the trailer...but"" SPOILER ALERT: It was and it wasn't funny at all. I wanted to like this movie I really did, but as one reviewer said, something just felt off, and it felt off for 92 minutes. I'm giving this a 3 rating b/c of the fact that had I not seen the trailer before hand those parts would have probably made me laugh. But in the theater where I watched the film there were LONG stretches of silence and very few laughs. In fact many times in the theater it was dead silence where thy writers seemed to put: PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER IN THE SCRIPT. The problem was there were none. If you want to see this movie now, re-watch the trailer and wait for the DVD. That is if you have an hour and half to kill one night.

The TV trailers are absolutely misleading and may be the most creative aspect of this production. Be warned it is not appropriate for teenagers and the ratings industry should be questioned for their thinking.Will never go to another movie starring Diaz. In the show she does drugs and you will need them to ease the pain of having paid to see this garbage. If there is any justice, viewers will vote against her ever getting another role in Hollywood.

So she went to a lot of trouble, a ridiculous amount of trouble to do so. So far as to make an attempt at doing her job of teaching kids, so they could pass the state test, and she would win coincidentally $5700 for having the most kids pass.

This film has no redeeming quality and the ending is cliché. How unfortunate. To top it off what Justin Timberlake brought the film was limp and poorly sung. Why would Cameron Diaz do this to her career. Who is writing this material and how can they be allowed to put this stuff through the pipeline in Hollywood. I'm not sure if irresponsible is even the correct word for such a poorly conceived movie. It isn't as if the actors involved had not made movies before, but it seems like this was a bad auditioning pilot for them. Seriously, stop making movies to grab some coin.

This little gem made the ""wise"" decision to focus on our Teacher, Diaz, playing the character you had already seen in the c*ck-teasers (trailers), a slut, with warped priorities.. Trailers give you that impression? Well, don't expect any surprises.This movie had potential, but I believe something disastrous happened once they come to understand the benefits they could reap from exploiting Diaz' sex appeal. For you see, rather than focusing on the characters with potential; the giddy, glee, zany teachers.. They instead decided to shift their focus on who I assume was initially implied as the antagonist, Teacher Elizabeth (Diaz). Do you enjoy seeing likable characters torn apart through misunderstandings, inflicted by a man-hunting gold-digger, only to have things go exactly her way? I know I do! Okay, I know what they were going for -- and honestly, I wouldn't have been so critical, and probably would've seen the light in a cock-tease comedy..Two (monumental) problems: 1. It's not funny, boringly so. 2. I fail to see the point in making a movie that centers itself around an unlikable character, when there are charming, far funnier characters at their disposal.Finally.. 3. It left me feeling miserable. Right from the beginning, our ""Protagonist"" got under my skin.. I was expecting, oh, maybe she'll come full circle and display some respectable character traits.. No. She splits two likable characters apart, manipulates people, and even ruins someones life, to invest in a new pair of false breasts.. And she didn't even bother getting them! What is the conclusion? Well, she's got a f*ck buddy. Riveting, isn't it? Okay, she decided to settle for someone not wealthy, over chemistry -- fair enough.. Problem is, it's exploited within the last 5 minutes of the flick. Yes, after spending the entire movie exploiting this character for the manipulative, money-hungry bitch she is.. We're expected to fish for positive traits within the last 5 minutes, just because she didn't hook up with the wealthy wrist-watch bloke? Well done, you get a gold star.Not really.

283,princessbrianna76,Why does this movie exist?,1,13 November 2012,"Just watched Bad Teacher. WHO ALLOWED THIS MOVIE TO BE MADE?! I watched it mostly because I really like Jason Segel and sometimes Cameron Diaz isn't terrible. But this movie... I'm not sure why this movie exists.If you're not familiar with this ""film"" I envy you.It stars Diaz as a crappy, disinterested junior high school teacher named Elizabeth. Her only goal in life is to marry a rich guy and spend as much of his money she can. The movie starts out with her leaving her teaching job, after one year, to marry a rich man, he wisely dumps her and she goes back to being a teacher until she can snare replacement wallet. The next school year starts out and she does nothing but show her class, she seems to have only the one class, movies that somehow incorporate school (Lean on Me, Dangerous Minds, etc.). She meets new teacher Scott, played by Justin Timberlake, who happens to have a rich family and decides that what she needs to snare this man, based on a picture of his ex, is bigger boobs. To do this she needs about $10,000. Hard to achieve on a teacher's salary so she volunteers to help with the school's car wash fundraiser and dresses like a slut in order to earn extra ""tips"" from pervy guys. All the while she is being pursued by Russell (Jason Segel), a gym teacher at the same school, whom she ignores because he's just a gym teacher. She also does what she can to appeal to the naive and stupid Scott who is interested in Elizabeth's rival Amy who does whatever she can to expose Diaz as a marijuana-smoking-in-the-parking-lot crappy teacher. Elizabeth learns that she can earn a $5700 bonus if her students get the highest scores in some standardized test. She tries to be a real teacher in order to get her students to pass but when it becomes apparent that this tactic will not produce the results she desires she seduces and drugs and employee at the testing company in order to steal a copy of the test. Her students end up getting the highest scores and she gets her bonus check. Amy discovers what she's done, after almost being poisoned when Elizabeth rubs poison ivy on an apply that Amy eats and Elizabeth steals her boyfriend Scott, and turns her in. Elizabeth blackmails the test company employee and escapes those charges. Amy then uses the drug use as a way to get Elizabeth fired. That backfires as well and Amy takes the rap for the drugs in Elizabeth's desk. Amy is sent to a school full of troubled teens, Elizabeth blows of rich guy Scott and hooks up with Russell. All the while never learning a single lesson. She gets away with all of the horrible things she's done and the good teacher who actually cares about teaching gets punished.Seriously?! This is the message of the movie? Lie, cheat, steal, drug and blackmail people, only be concerned with how much money somebody has, bigger boobs will make you happy, treat kids and your coworkers like crap, smoke pot, poison coworkers, use inappropriate language around kids and just be a bitch.

289,JohnnyV123,Surprisingly Bad,3,25 June 2011,"I went to see this movie based on the trailer which made me laugh even on repeat viewings. Bad Teacher just does not live up to the promise from its trailer.Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey who just after finishing her first year teaching middle school has to come back for year two when her rich fiancée dumps her for only marrying him for his money.Elizabeth is broke and living in a ramshackle apartment with roommate Kirk (a funny performance from Modern Family's Eric Stonestreet). She has no interest in teaching and instead shows her class movies all day to pass the time until a new substitute named Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) arrives to the school with an implied family fortune that Elizabeth can't wait to get her hands on.Fellow teacher and star faculty member Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) has her sights set on Scott as well and what follows is mostly a fight between the two to land him, which means being underhanded and conniving to Elizabeth. On the side, gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) is also vying for Elizabeth's affections only to repeatedly be turned down. A sub plot develops about a bonus for the teacher whose students score the best in testing which Elizabeth cheats to win and creates suspicion and investigation from Squirrel.The actors are all good. Diaz does a good job of playing an unbelievable character believably. Lucy Punch is over the top as Ms. Squirrel but is consistently funny when on screen. Justin Timberlake has a less forceful role but creates laughs when he's on screen. Jason Segel does good for what he is given but that unfortunately is not very much in ways of dialogue or character. Phyllis Smith of Office fame is great in her supporting role as Diaz's friend as is John Michael Higgins as the principal and Thomas Lennon is adequate in his brief role as a test administrator.Surprisingly, this movie is bad. The writing and direction is largely to blame. In a comedy, I should expect to laugh. However, this movie attempts to be funny by having Diaz say something raunchy or drop an F bomb mostly out of context and almost none of them land.I can count at least three minor plots that went absolutely nowhere 1. Diaz's character wanting fake breasts is never given a real explanation but is brought up over and over again 2. Bribing the parents and stealing the dolphin statue from one of them that she gives to the principal 3. Anything with the state of her class or the testing.Diaz's character Elizabeth is just so meanly written and static while suffering no consequences from anything that it makes her impossible to root for. She already is the uncaring and rude teacher but the script takes it to another level when Scott and Ms. Squirrel legitimately fall for each other with no shadiness. Elizabeth can't take this and gives Ms. Squirrel poison ivy and gets Scott to cheat on Squirrel with her (one of the few raunchy funny scenes that work). Elizabeth never gets any reprimand from the school or even from pursuer Russell (Segel) who doesn't care how awful she is which makes her later consoling a student don't redeem her.It's also strange how little we see of her actually being the bad teacher to her class. In a better movie like School of Rock we are able to connect with the kids as characters which seemed to be a large missing component from this movie save for one kid.If you enjoy raunchy humor just for shock value's sake this might be for you but please don't listen to the people saying it's like Bad Santa which is a much much better movie. This doesn't have the comedy or the faint bit of heart to even touch Bad Santa.I was let down by this one.",Bad Teacher

Yah it's dumb, definitely shouldn't watch with any expectations but I was just looking for a light comedy and this sure delivered. Would definitely recommend to a friend:)",Bad Teacher
291,dwk-04115,"Insult to Teachers, Students and just about Everybody",1,26 April 2016,"I was a fan of Cameron Diaz until I saw this movie. If Diaz and other actors in this movie can't see why this movie is an insult to hard working teachers, students and parents alike, then there is really no point in repeating what was already said many times by other reviewers.Perhaps if Diaz and others in this movie had children of their own, maybe they will realize that there is really nothing funny about making a mockery of your children's education and the education system that is miserably failing millions of children in this country.Shame on you. Read the news. This isn't entertainment. This is just bad in every which way and then some.",Bad Teacher
292,travcarmody-69057,Not great but watchable,6,17 May 2019,"Bad Teacher is definitely not a great movie, not even a great comedy, but the haters seem to miss the fact that the standout fact here is that Diaz can hold her own in the crass comedy culture. If she was just given a chance I believe she could perform greatly in whatever Rogan/Goldberg have planned next. I've never been a fan of Cameron Diaz until this movie. Seth Rogan, Evan Goldberg, keep her in mind.",Bad Teacher
