0,TheLittleSongbird,A sheer delight with something for everyone,9,30 March 2015,"Was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, to be honest, after seeing the trailer which gave off the vibe that it was going to be another live-action/CGI outing with a weak script, a predictable story, cheap gags and characters we don't care about. After seeing the film, Paddington had none of those things and the trailer really did not do it justice, it may not entirely have the essence of the stories and TV series but it modernises the setting etc. very cleverly and stands very well on its own terms.Paddington looks great, with lots of vibrant colour in the sets(the forest in the prologue is beautiful as well) and with photography that's not haphazard or sloppy. Paddington himself is brilliantly animated and the complete opposite of cheap. The music has its playful-in the humour/slap-stick- and soothing)in the emotional parts) moments, while the script is a sheer delight with deliciously witty dialogue that children and adults alike will understand and enjoy. The story is also a winner, the comedy scenes are just hilarious and very well-timed, something that will absolutely delight children, and the adult jokes are equally sly with inspired references(in a visual way) to the likes of Wes Anderson. Paddington also has a lot of heart and warmth, there are some emotional moments and they were very touchingly done without being cloying, and there is even a bit of suspense thrown in without being too dark or out of place.In Paddington, I found myself really engaging with the characters even Mr Brown. The strongest being Paddington who is incredibly endearing, it's almost impossible not to love him. Ben Wishaw also voices him absolutely beautifully, bringing a calm, youthful quality to it. Hugh Bonneville is appropriately uptight and stern while also bringing humour and warmth to Mr Brown. Sally Hawkins is compassionate, the children are good and Nicole Kidman is both amusing and menacing(wasn't crazy about the wig though. Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters play their roles expertly, Walters especially is a hoot as Mrs Bird, while Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon while limited in appearance bring heart to their roles. My only complaint that Mr Curry should have had more screen time and the film could have stayed truer to the character in the stories and series. Peter Capaldi does a good job, but the character and his acrimonious relationship with Paddington was one of the best things of the series and Mr Curry instead seemed more of a plot device, with the relationship between them barely explored.To conclude, a delightful family film with something for everyone. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Paddington
1,SnoopyStyle,absolutely charming,8,20 June 2015,"A geographic explorer goes to the darkest Peru and encounters two ingenious bears. He names them Pastuzo and Lucy wondering what will come of them. They learn English, admire London and love marmalade. Many years later, they are joined by their young nephew. After a storm devastates their home, the young bear goes to London with Aunt Lucy promising a welcoming place. Instead he is alone and only taken in by Mary Brown (Sally Hawkins) although her husband Henry (Hugh Bonneville) is very risk-adverse. She names him Paddington after the train station. There is also Millicent (Nicole Kidman) who wants to stuff the bear.This honors the children series with a bear that is charming and delightful. It's a lot fun comedy without too many pop culture references. That gives it a timeless quality. The family is terrific and Nicole Kidman is interesting as the villain with a real story of her own. This is a perfect little family film.",Paddington
2,Horst_In_Translation,About a Bear,6,25 December 2014,"Well.. that this is a very British movie is granted as one of the Mr. Bean writers was responsible for the script here, together with director/writer Paul King. He has worked mostly for the small screen so far, but did a very nice job here. Admittedly, he gets help from a whole bunch of Britain's finest actors and actresses: Hugh Bonneville, who got lots of fame from Downton Abbey in recent years, and Sally Hawkins (such a likable presence here and mostly in everything else she is in), who just scored her first Academy Award nomination. And then there are also Julie Walters, Peter Capaldi, Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent and Imelda Staunton and quite a few more, not to forget the Irish Michael Gambon and Hawaiian-born Nicole Kidman. Kidman is probably still the biggest name in the cast. She plays the villain here, a woman who intends to catch and stuff Paddington. She reminded me a bit of Cruella De Vil. The whole character is very cartoonish. It could come right out of an animation movie. I also had to think of the French cop lady who hunts the Madagascar animals.There are some dramatic sequences in the film, even a touch of death with the scientist being dead as we find out in the end and Paddington's dad also dying, but as a whole it is a very positive, uplifting and funny film. The humor is extremely playful and very slapstick from start to finish. Paddington is pretty much an animated bear version of Charlie Chaplinwith an ounce of Winnie-the-Pooh. The toothpaste scene is quite funny and how he manages to flood the whole house. Also how Bonneville's character brushes his teeth afterward. So gross, but in an entertaining way. He kinda deserved it for how he behaved towards the bear. Or how fast he wanted to seal the insurance deal after Paddington was already about to crash the house. I am not that much of a fan of Bonneville, especially in the terribly overrated ""Downton Abbey"", but here I liked him. Another scene I liked was the transformation scene after giving birth. Hilarious! On a random note, I expected Capaldi's character to be the scientist who traveled to Peru early in the film, but nope, I was wrong.The movie also has lots of heart in it. It may be the best Christmas film from 2014, even if it does not play during the holidays. It has nice music, many famous songs and also some Latino music due to Paddington's Peruvian origins. I recommend watching this film, a nice choice for the whole family.",Paddington
3,Prismark10,The land of marmalade,6,11 December 2016,"Author Michael Bond was inspired to write the Paddington stories when he saw kids leaving being evacuated during World War 2 and this film has a subtext of the immigrant experience.Aided with a touch of Wes Anderson stylishness, this is a sweet family film but lacks the warmth of the BBC television series from the 1970s that were narrated by Sir Michael Hordern.Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) is a young bear from darkest Peru who speaks English and loves marmalade sandwiches thanks to a British geographer who met his family years earlier.When their home in Peru is destroyed, Paddington's aunt (Imelda Staunton) sends him to London with a note and a suitcase hoping to meet the explorer who came into contact his aunt and uncle so many years ago.Alone and lost at Paddington Station he is taken in by the kind hearted Mrs Brown (Sally Hawkins) although her husband (Hugh Bonneville) is reluctant but the children warm to him and they name the bear Paddington.Hot on the heels is an evil taxidermist Millicent (Nicole Kidman) who intends to capture and stuff the bear and display him at a museum.As Paddington goes about accidentally causing mayhem, locals do not react to the talking bear, he is viewed as another foreigner. The film becomes a caper movie as he tries to avoid being captured by Millicent and the film pastiches movies such as Mission Impossible.The film is nice enough, kids will enjoy it, a few nice touches but despite some visual flourishes it was passable rather than outstanding. It needed some kind of Nick Park and Aardman Animation type of inspiration.",Paddington
4,kosmasp,So Bears talk ....,7,25 April 2015,"Or at least no one in London seems to think otherwise. If you get hung up on something like this though, you won't be able to enjoy the movie at all. It's really nice told and the animation is great. It's obviously aimed at kids or a younger audience, but it's fun for the whole family. There are quite some cute and sweet situations occurring throughout the movie.Obviously you will see where this is going (though interesting note on what people have under their hats, I should've known that), that's not where the movies strength lies. It's the finding a home for a cute bear thing that will either get your heart or maybe annoy you. Whatever the case, a great kids movie",Paddington
5,classicsoncall,"""I just did what any bear would do.""",8,19 January 2015,"My recent viewing occurred in a nearly sold out theater with kids outnumbering adults and there was no doubt they were having a good time. The crowd went audible in all the right spots and the biggest pop came when Paddington lost his grip and nearly went over backwards in the chimney flue - wow, the kids gave a collective gasp that turned to cheers when the Brown Family made the save.You have to hand it to the animators and CGI artists for this effort. Paddington interacted with his human family like a real person and the effort looked seamless. You'll be asking yourself more than once - How did they do that? Especially effective was the bathtub cascading down the stairs when Paddington had that slight accident in the bathroom. Very cleverly done.Overall a nice family friendly movie except for that dastardly Nicole Kidman, but come on now, you knew nothing bad was going to happen to Paddington. By the look of things, I think we might be seeing more of the little guy.",Paddington
6,jboothmillard,Paddington,8,17 December 2014,"When I was a child I watched the classic 1975 cartoon, on many occasions the first episode ""Please Look After This Bear"", other animated versions followed, and a couple of funny Marmite adverts, but finally it was the Harry Potter producer David Heyman that brought the cuddly character to the big screen, based on the books by Michael Bond. Basically in darkest Peru explorer Montgomery Clyde (Tim Downie) discovered a family of semi-intelligent bears, who can speak English, and have an appetite for marmalade, he tells them they are always welcome to Britain should they wish to visit. The bears, Uncle Pastuzo (Michael Gambon) and Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) live in harmony with their young nephew (Skyfall's Ben Whishaw), but one day an earthquake strikes their home, Pastuzo disappears, leaving nothing but his red hat, so Aunt Lucy encourages her nephew to leave in a lifeboat and find solace in London while she moves into the retirement home for old bears. The young bear reaches London and ends up in Paddington railway station, all he has is his suitcase and a marmalade sandwich under his hat, he is unable to find a home, until he is met by the Brown family, he is greeted by wife and mother Mrs. Mary Brown (Blue Jasmine's Sally Hawkins), she notices the label around his neck, saying ""Please Look After This Bear. Thank You"", taken to tea by Mr. Henry Brown (Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville) the young bear tells his name, which is a roar, so he is given a new English name, Paddington. Encouraged by the his wife and children, son Jonathan (The Impossible's Samuel Joslin) and Judy (Madeleine Harris), Mr. Brown reluctantly allows Paddington to stay at the home, that they share with Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters), but he is adamant it will be for one night, Paddington should then try to find a permanent home, and in no time at all things begin to happen, with the Peruvian bear causing a series of accidents. Later he explains that he believes though he could find a home with the help of the explorer who found his family, and the next day, seeing antique expert Mr. Gruber (Jim Broadbent), he and Mrs. Brown find out his hat is an artefact. Meanwhile sadistic museum owner and taxidermist Millicent (Nicole Kidman) stuffs and displays animals for her collection, her guard (Fonejacker's Kayvan Novak) tells how he noticed marmalade stains on a cargo ship, she knows instantly this is the species of bear she is has been searching for years, finding him she wants to hunt Paddington down, he meanwhile with the help of Mr. Brown searches British archives to find entries of the explorations in darkest Peru, they confirm the name M. Clyde and use the phone book to locate all addresses under that name. While Paddington stays in the house alone, Millicent, who is scheming with the Brown's neighbour Mr. Curry (Doctor Who's Peter Capaldi), sneaks in and tries to capture the bear, he inadvertently drives her away, but she does set fire to the house, the Brown family do not believe his story of what happened and believe it is time for him to move out and find a new home as soon as possible. Feeling unwanted Paddington leaves and tries to find Montgomery Clyde himself, after many fails he finally finds the explorer's home, Clyde is revealed to have died years ago, it is revealed Millicent is his daughter, she was bitter towards her father for not capturing the specimen of bears he claimed to have found, he was scorned by the Natural History Museum. Millicent manages to tranquilise Paddington, Mr. Curry betrays her when he realises she plans to have the bear stuffed, he informs the Brown family and they rush to save their friend, locked in the museum they manage to save him, and Millicent is defeated by his marmalade sandwich and a huge flock of hungry pigeons, in the end Paddington is adopted, Millicent is punished for her crimes doing community service in an animal shelter, and Paddington writes to his Aunt Lucy about his happiness at finding a home at last. Also starring Peep Show's Matt King as Andre the Thief, Matt Lucas as Taxi Driver, Geoffrey Palmer as Head of Geographer's Guild, Sightseers' Alice Lowe as Geographer's Receptionist, Sightseers' Steve Oram as Paddington Security Guard, Miranda's Dominic Coleman as Policeman, The Thick of It's Will Smith as Modern geographer, This Is England's George Newton as Angel, Simon Farnaby as Barry the Security Guard and a cameo from Paddington creator Michael Bond as Man at Paddington Station. Colin Firth was originally cast as the eponymous bear, but he quit, claiming he could not perfect the voice, Whishaw is the perfect voice for the young sometimes troublesome but adorable furry friend everybody would want, Bonneville and Hawkins are likable as the Brown family parents, Kidman is amusing as the woman hellbent on stuffing the innocent bear. There was a fair amount in the news about this film being released in cinemas with a PG certificate, because of its innuendo and mild threat, 101 Dalmatians has similar themes and is accepted as a U (LOL), anyway, you ignore this, because it has great special effects to create the believable CGI character in the red hat and blue raincoat, and the slapstick and thrills work well for both children and adults, it is a very British and enjoyable family comedy adventure. Very good!",Paddington
7,tavm,Paddington was an enjoyable enough family film,7,8 February 2015,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. I remember reading a Paddington picture book when I was under 12 and being partially amused by the story. So watching this movie was both pretty funny and a little touching. And what a sport Nicole Kidman was playing a villain and getting hers at the end! When I originally saw the trailer with the bear getting his head stuck in the toilet after putting the toothbrushes in his ear, well, part of me was worried some bathroom humor would have been snuck in there but, no, this was a very clean movie with some semi-intense scenes involving said villain. So on that note, Paddington was enjoyable enough for me and my friend I just referred to.",Paddington
8,studioAT,Wonderful,8,29 March 2020,A very sweet adaption of the classic children's books by Michael Bond.This deserves all the hype it received as it is a well-made children's film that adults can enjoy/learn a lot from too.With a lot of heart and humour this is a perfect film to watch during these troubled times.,Paddington
9,Scarecrow-88,Paddington,8,3 December 2016,"Paddington, the beloved Michael Bond bear known by generations in children's books, made his welcome CGI live action debut with this delightfully spirited hoot, hopping on a boat hidden after leaving ""darkest Peru"" for London after an explorer visited him and his aunt/uncle in the jungle, making quite an impression on them. Once in London he encounters risk analyst and his family who aren't as much astounded by a talking bear as concerned about his need of a refuge. Meanwhile a taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) eyes Paddington for her natural museum. While the attention to detail and quirky direction warrant comparison to Wes Anderson, the treat of this film is how London is used as an aesthetic backdrop for Paddington's adventures. And the CGI work for the bear and the marvelous voicework of Ben Whishaw enhance the whole experience. Marmalade is ever present, as is the explorer's hat with the sandwich Paddington never gets to eat because of those pesky pigeons. Paddington's bond with the Browns (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, and Samuel Joslin) despite unfortunately flooding from a bathroom mishap and a fire in their kitchen caused by Kidman trying to snatch him tightens as the bear wins their hearts. Sweet tone never wavers despite Kidman's dark character, cleverly tied to the explorer who met Paddington's family years ago. The subway scenes (including a dazzler involving Paddington chasing down a pickpocket) are exciting, visually arresting, and amusing, especially an escalator which Paddington is confounded by. The antiquities shop, with Jim Broadbent and that amazing train inside, is a big wow. Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon offer fun voicework as Paddington's aunt and uncle, besieged in the jungle by an earthquake. Julie Walters is a treat as eccentric housekeeper for the Browns who offers her opinions from time to time and comes in handy when the family must rescue Paddington from Kidman. Peter Capaldi as the nosy next door neighbor who sides with Kidman to rid the apartments of the bear steals the film when he is on screen. The inventive set pieces involving the Smiths residence inescapably call to mind Anderson's oeuvre but are all the same striking. Recommended family film for the holidays.",Paddington
10,LeonLouisRicci,HUGGABLE & LOVABLE FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT...WARM...WITTY...WONDERFUL,9,26 August 2021,"Paddington was Born in 1959 and has Lived Through Nearly 30 Books and other Pop-Culture Entertainments.The Lovable, Polite, and Lonesome Little Bear is Brought to New Life by this British Movie with Heart and Soul.The Lessons are Basic ""Get-Along"", ""Be Respectful"", and Enjoy what Life has to Offer.The Movie is an Adventurous and Engaging Story of Paddington's Journey to London.He was Told Years Earlier that He Would be Welcomed with Open Arms.Well Not So Much.Paddington Struggles to Find a ""Home"" and Acceptance in the ""New World"" and does have His Problems Fitting In.But Fortunately He Happens upon the ""Brown"" Family (Paddington is Brown so that's a start), who are Congenial and Help the Lost Soul Gain some Grounding.There is Wit, Slapstick, and All Kinds of Humour in Paddington's Adventure.Some of it is Scary and Suspenseful, with Nicole Kidman on His Trail.She wants to Mount Him in a Museum.But Should Not Adversely Affect Well Grounded Youngsters.In Fact, it is one of the Most Enjoyable, Non-Offensive Family Movies of Animation and Live Action to come along in a Long Time.It's a Glorious and Fun-Filled Film for the Whole Family.Enjoyable and Heart-Warming Watch.",Paddington
11,writers_reign,Ideas Above Its Station?,7,9 December 2014,"I haven't read a single word of any of Michael Bond's books about Paddington Bear but like most people living in England I was aware more or less by osmosis that he was native to Peru, sported a hat, had a penchant for marmalade sandwiches and somehow fetched up at Paddington Station soon after leaving his native land. It would appear that this is all the filmmakers have retained from the books but given my ignorance of them it doesn't really affect me. What the film did have was money reviews in respectable journals on the strength of which I went along on the second week of release and found a pleasant enough 'family' film which ignores logic to the extent that in an early sequence Paddington virtually destroys the Brown's home which is magically restored in a matter of minutes. Whilst I wouldn't want to see it again it was a pleasant time passer.",Paddington
12,grantss,"Sweet, funny, fun movie",8,3 November 2015,"Sweet, funny, fun movie.An English explorer visits the jungles of Peru and befriends a couple of bears. A few decades later the bears' home is destroyed and the child of the bears goes to London to find the explorer...Wonderful movie, suitable for all ages. Decent plot that, unlike many children's stories, isn't random or full of holes. Very funny too - has many laugh-out-loud moments. There's an English quirkiness and whimsicalness that carries the whole movie and provides many of the best comedic moments.Great performances by an all-star cast: Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Peter Capaldi (of The Thick of It fame - here he is in a rare non-swearing role...), Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters. Ben Wishaw is great as the voice of Paddington as are Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon as his (bear) parents. Nicole Kidman is convincing as the villain. Even the minor parts include some big names: Matt Lucas (of Little Britain fame) appears as a cabbie and Kayvan Novak (Facejacker) also has a small part.A great movie and not just for children.",Paddington
13,neil-476,Highly recommended. A true family film.,9,5 December 2014,"A small bear from Peru arrives in London and is given shelter and the name Paddington by the Brown family (somewhat against the wishes of Mr Brown). Mishaps follow, not least because someone wishes to add Paddington to a collection of stuffed animals.Paddington has been a staple of UK kids' literature for donkeys years (and author Michael Bond cameos in this film). Somehow, my family has missed all except the occasional episode of the animated TV series of 5 minute shorts voiced by Michael Hordern years ago so, while I know the basics of the Paddington mythology (marmalade sandwiches), I come to this film as a complete novice.And it is a wonderful film. The story is simple and easy to follow, but full of momentum. The characters are all well-drawn, sympathetic, and well played (Julie Walters's tendency towards excess is, thankfully, reined in), the child players are very much better than is usual in British films, Paddington himself is utterly charming and wonderfully voiced by Ben Whishaw. Nicole Kidman is a convincing, but funny villain, and the film strikes a good balance between the prejudice necessary for a suitably dramatic story and the heartwarming humanity which leaves you uplifted at the end.Paddington himself is beautifully designed, animated, and integrated into the background plates, and the CGI generally is well done – noticeable when it needs to be, and subtle and understated the rest of the time.The film is often very funny, and you leave the cinema happier than when you went in.",Paddington
14,anaconda-40658,Ted is Better.,5,5 February 2016,"Paddington (2014): Dir: Paul King / Cast: Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Nicole Kidman, Peter Capaldi / Voice: Ben Whishaw: Innocent yet simplistic family film about a little bear named Paddington whose home in Peru is shattered by an earthquake. An explorer discovers his family and decides to preserve their legacy. Now years later, Paddington travels to London in hopes of gaining a home. He is taken in by one family of four but his struggles with modern appliances and technology lead to some amusing bits that unfortunately never highlight the spirit of the film the way it should have. Central plot regards a taxidermist who desires to stuff Paddington. While the film is harmless viewing for families, it strays too far from its slapstick marketing thus sabotaging its tone severely. Director Paul King's best sidekick is the visual creation of Paddington. He's a young bear of curiosity and his expressive face is perhaps the best element of the film. The human characters are unfortunately one dimensional and predictable. Hugh Bonneville plays the father who resents Paddington early on before assisting him in his search for the explorer of years prior. Sally Hawkins as his wife is over the top in her acceptance of Paddington and yearning for her husband to step it up. Nicole Kidman is miscast as the villain taxidermist who comes off like someone who walked off the Mission: Impossible set. Peter Capaldi does what he can as a busy- body neighbor. Paddington is brought to life by the voice of Ben Whishaw. Theme regards family and acceptance while a decent idea becomes hidden in all the fuzz. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Paddington
15,safenoe,Loved it! Paddington pre-Brexit,9,4 October 2016,"I remember visiting Paddington Tube Station and seeking out the Paddington statue, and yes I'm a Paddington Bear fan! The movie isn't for everyone, just as no movie is for everyone, but it's a lot of fun and quite touching as well. It was emotionally charged when Paddington's uncle died in the earthquake, and I think for closure his funeral should have been depicted. Maybe that's in the cut scenes on the DVD.This was filmed two years before Brexit, so hopefully Paddington has his UK citizenship in time for the sequel which I believe is due for release in 2017. In the sequel I'd like to see more focus on Paddington's fight against racism displayed by obese bus inspectors in Oxford.",Paddington
16,gradyharp,'This family needed that wee bear every bit as much as he needed you. There. Said my piece.',9,21 September 2018,"Paul King wrote (with Hamish McColl) the screenplay based on Michael Bond's lovable character Paddington and also directs this warmly sentimental, entertaining film that carries as many observations and comments about human behavior as it does in making a little bear come to life in a very human manner.A young Peruvian bear lives with his uncle (Uncle Pastuzo - Michael Gambon - voice, and Aunt Lucy - Imelda Staunton - voice) and is discovered by an Explorer Montgomery Clyde (Tim Downie). The young marmalade loving bear (voice Ben Whishaw) has a passion for all things British, travels to London in search of a home. Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington Station, he begins to realize that city life is not all he had imagined - until he meets the kind Brown family (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and mad Julie Walters), who read the label around his neck ('Please look after this bear. Thank you.') and offer him a temporary haven. It looks as though his luck has changed until this rarest of bears catches the eye of a museum taxidermist (Nicole Kidman). But love and acceptance and familial needs rise to the point where this little wisp of a fairytale comes into bloom quite nicely.The actors are excellent and the CGI effects that create Paddington are superb. In all this is a film to see repeatedly whenever our frustrations with social faux pas becomes distasteful. Recommended.",Paddington
17,mm-39,A strong comic film.,7,3 January 2016,"Paddington works well. All the great ingredients of a good film. A compelling story. Will Paddington find a home in a new environment? The fish out of water humour of Paddington's adventure works well. The chain reaction silly event comedy done in a silly British way! Likable characters Paddington, the family and the villain were well casted. We can relate with the story arch of each character. The comic,dramatic, and evil characters all deliver strong performances. The director knows when to create drama, empathy, and comedy with the right timing. Paddington (the character and movie) is silly and even more silly. A good escape for adults as well as children. The effects where not too C G Iish 7 out of 10 stars.",Paddington
18,Mr-Fusion,It's hard to fault this bear,7,25 June 2016,"I confess that I was never taken with the marketing for ""Paddington"". MOstly, the CG in the bear himself. But that tends to be absorbed into the movie's overall sweetness and playful visual style. At the heart of this is a wholesome message about human decency and belonging, and it's populated with likable Brits (Hugh Bonneville, in particular). Some good laughs, too; like seeing a trying to figure out a toothbrush or negotiate scotch tape.It's a good-natured movie, and what makes it a cut (or two or three) above modern family fare is that there's very little in the way of pop culture references and hipness.Just warmth.7/10",Paddington
19,JamesHitchcock,Ursus Sapiens,8,20 February 2015,"What would happen if Homo sapiens had to share Planet Earth with another species of similar intelligence? That seems like the premise for some deeply serious work for adults, but in fact it is also the basis for a number of light-hearted children's stories, including Michael Bond's ""Paddington Bear"" which was a great favourite of mine as a child. The idea behind the stories is that bears (or at least one species of bear) are intelligent creatures, who can speak and interact with humans, and that one particular bear of this species is living as part of a middle- class British family at No. 32 Windsor Gardens, London, where he goes by the name Paddington, after the station on which the family found him. Some have suggested that Paddington is a Spectacled Bear, that being the only species of bear actually found in Peru, but in neither the books nor the film does he look like one. (Here he looks more like an undersized grizzly). Natural history does not appear to have been Bond's strong point; Paddington was originally to have been from Africa, until someone pointed out that there are no bears in that continent, and he is probably supposed to belong to a fictitious species.Bond has written a number of Paddington books, but these are collections of short stories rather than novels, and the film-makers evidently thought that to base the movie on a series of these stories would make it too episodic. Apart from the early scenes which deal with Paddington's initial meeting with the Brown family and his entry into their home, they have come up with a plot based around a character who does not appear in the books. Bond's stories do not really contain any villains, apart from the Browns' mildly unpleasant neighbour Mr Curry, but the film includes a villainess roughly equivalent to Cruella de Vil in ""101 Dalmatians""- Millicent Clyde, the director of the Natural History Museum. (Curry, played by current Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, does appear as her sidekick).Millicent's great ambition is to capture Paddington, stuff him and put him in her museum and thereby gain academic kudos as the discoverer of a new species. Now this is a massive plot hole, for two reasons. Firstly, if Paddington really did represent a new species he would be more valuable to Millicent alive than dead. Secondly, in Bond's universe talking bears are not in fact an unfamiliar species at all. Although they are by no means common on the streets of London- Paddington never seems to meet another one apart from his Aunt Lucy- the human characters are well aware that they exist. The one thing nobody ever says in the books is ""My God! A talking bear!"" Another plot hole concerns Millicent's age. The early scenes, showing how Paddington's family were originally located in Darkest Peru by her explorer father Montgomery Clyde, appear to take place in the twenties or thirties which, as Millicent was a child at the time and the rest of the film is set in the present, would suggest she would by now be around eighty or ninety. Instead, she is played by the splendidly sexy Nicole Kidman, forty- something but looking much younger.Fortunately, most of the potential audience for the film will be children, who do not always analyse these things as deeply as adults and will doubtless love the sequences in which Paddington tries to evade the evil Millicent's attempt to capture him. The other main plot line involves Paddington's attempts to fit in with his adopted family. Bears may be intelligent, but they do not understand the ways of suburban man very well and Paddington's clumsiness leads to him causing havoc at Windsor Gardens. At first Mr. Brown is not keen to welcome a bear into his home but eventually relents when he realises how attached his children have become to Paddington. The film has a none-too-subtle message of ""be tolerant and welcoming to strangers. Even bears"".Fans of the book will be delighted that so many of their features have been preserved- Paddington's old hat and duffle coat, his love of marmalade (especially in sandwiches), his Hard Stares, his friendship with the kindly old antiques dealer Samuel Gruber- although there have been a couple of changes. (Mrs. Bird, for example, is no longer the Brown's housekeeper but rather a relative). They say that one should never work with children or animals, and this film shows that this principle applies to digital animals as well as flesh-and-blood ones because (with all due apologies to the very cute Ms Kidman) Paddington, as voiced by Ben Whishaw, is by far the cutest thing about this movie. Children (and, I suspect, many adults) will love him and his merry antics. 8/10",Paddington
20,lasttimeisaw,"A cutesy kid's fare, routine storyline",6,13 April 2015,"Nostalgia of the original PADDINGTON BEAR series aside, Paul King's PADDINGTON is a trademark Christmas offering from UK, a love letter to London and everything is tailor-made to not cross the borderline of being kids-friendly, but for adult audience who doesn't grow up with the said bear, the film is generically predictable (the only exception belongs to the yardstick that Londoners never even raise their eyebrows to see a talking bear in front of them) and one might feel a bit disappointed that it couldn't be more daring or ingenious considering its all-too-cute art productions which resemble lightweight Wes Anderson artworks and a wonderfully anthropomorphic CGI bear named Paddington (voiced by Whishaw). Opening with a vintage black and white episode of introducing a mysterious bear species in the Peruvian jungle, then, swiftly brings about a radiant jungle view where Paddington lives with his uncle and auntie, until his home-finding trip to London. ""Finding home"" is the theme of Paddington's adventure, he meets the Brown Family, the patriarch Henry (Bonneville) is too afraid to venture for the sake of his two children, whilst his wife Mary (Hawkins) is the Good Samaritan, stands by Paddington with firm footing. What happens next is well within our expectation of any member of its kind, the attachment between Paddington and The Browns grows inevitably, then a villainess comes on-board, a bob- haired Nicole Kidman as Millicent, a taxidermist who insists (with a background connection) to capture Paddington to stuff him as a specimen, it is glad to see Nicole back in the villain chair after the ruinous THE GOLDEN COMPASS (2007, 4/10), and this time, the ship doesn't sink. The film never stops to being a winning delicacy if the quaint Anglo-Saxon style and teddy bear is exactly your thing, many whimsical set pieces are between charming (Paddington unwittingly chases a pickpocket) and slightly balmy (Bonneville's transvestite outfit) and au fond Paddington is just a little foreign boy who happens to be in a bear's appearance, being ignorant in human society and making mess with his clumsiness. The heightened face-off is very bland as all the violence has been properly tone-downed. But Ben Whishaw's voice is unambiguously the soul of the movie, sometimes boyishly chirpy, sometimes soothingly touching, consummately nourishes the verve of this brazenly self-indulgent and subtly self- propagating fantasy with winsome veneer.",Paddington
21,Hellmant,"Doesn't deserve nearly as good of reviews, as it's been getting!",5,10 April 2015,"'PADDINGTON': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A live-action, mixed with CGI, adaptation of the popular character 'Paddington Bear'; from children's books (dating back to 1958) written by Michael Bond. The film tells of Paddington's adventures in London, after he escapes the jungles of Peru, and his relationship with the family that adopts him there, The Browns. It stars Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington (who was created using CGI and animatronics) and it costars Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters; in live-action human roles. The film was directed and co-written (with Hamish McColl) by Paul King. I think it's a decent kids' film but it doesn't deserve nearly as good of reviews, as it's been getting.The story begins with a geographer, named Montgomery Clyde (Tim Downie), discovering a family of intelligent bears, that can learn to speak English (among other things), in the jungles of Peru. After educating them a little, on his British human culture, he departs. Upon leaving, he invites them to come visit him; if they ever leave Peru (he also gives them his hat). Many years later the bears' home is destroyed in an earthquake. One bear, called Aunt Lucy (the voice of Imelda Staunton), sends her young nephew, Paddington (Whishaw), away to London; on a cargo ship. Upon arriving at a railway station, in London, Paddington is taken in by the Brown family, temporarily, until they can help him find a permanent home. Several mishaps ensue, as Paddington struggles to adapt to a human family life. He's also pursued by a taxidermist, named Millicent Clyde (Kidman), who wants to capture Paddington; in order to have him stuffed and put in the Natural History Museum.The movie is filled with a lot of silly children's humor and sappy family melodrama. It's well made, to a certain extent, and it also seems somewhat faithful to it's source material. Still I can't see why the film got such good reviews. It's definitely nothing much more than a somewhat decent kids' movie. I'm not it's target audience, I know, but I also don't think I would have enjoyed it that much when I was a kid. Some children (especially very small ones) might like it, but almost everyone else will probably be bored (like I was).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/dJ7Sq2i4_Jg",Paddington
22,Buddy-51,Entertaining for all audiences,7,23 May 2015,"Based on the works of author Michael Bond, ""Paddington"" tells the story of a talking bear (Ben Whishaw) from ""darkest"" Peru who stows away on a cargo ship to start a new life for himself in London. Once there, he becomes involved with a family named Brown (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin), who take him into their home on a temporary basis, and a villainous taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) intent on literally ""stuffing"" the bear for an exhibit in a natural history museum. Written by Paul King and Hamish McColl and directed by King, ""Paddington"" is a seamless blend of live action and animation, cheery in tone and beautiful to look at, thanks to the highly stylized art direction and production design that adorn the film. The humor ranges from the brittle to the overly broad (Bonneville dressed as an old scrubwoman sounds a discordant note in an otherwise fairly sophisticated screenplay). The movie also includes some subtle little homages to ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""Mission Impossible"" and, most notably, Walt Disney's ""Mary Poppins."" Fast-paced, well acted, and with warmth and charm to spare, ""Paddington"" is a whimsical treat that should appeal almost as much to oldsters as it does to youngsters.",Paddington
23,Lejink,Bear necessity,7,23 December 2018,"I always preferred Paddington to Garfield anyway. Mind you, if you'd told me they could extend Michael Bond's newspaper strip cartoon which I remember better as an animated five minute slot-filler into a 95 minute feature film, I wouldn't have believed you. Well, toast me in marmalade if they haven't achieved that with this very amusing and enjoyable combination live-action / CGI movie.I firstly enjoyed the mock-Pathe News scene-setting prologue, spoofing boy's own adventure tales introducing to the impish little bear later to be christened Paddington and his aunt and uncle seniors, until an unexpected natural disaster leads to the little bear crossing from darkest Peru to, as it happens, not especially enlightened modern-day London. Taken in, temporarily at least, by a reasonably dysfunctional family headed by reformed rocker turned over-protective dad Hugh Bonneville, it's not long before the marmalade-loving baby bovine is creating merry havoc in their home. Things get worse for them all when a mysterious baddie in the form of blonde-bobbed Nicola Kidman takes an unhealthy interest in Paddington's welfare.While the above plot-outline of itself suggests a fast-moving series of events, what enhances the film much more are the numerous jokes dropped in to the story more than frequently and especially the imaginative animation scenes which constantly impress, like the doll's house perspective of the Brown family home or the air-pocket messaging system at the National History Museum. There are sight gags, witty gags (I especially liked the bear-punning sequence) and running gags, some even cocking a snook at the franchise of Mrs Kidman's ex.The cast obviously have fun with the material and situations, besides Bonneville-Scott and Kidman, there are enjoyable turns by Julie Walters, Peter Capaldi and Sally Hawkins while the kids too happily avoid being either cute or irritating.No there's nothing grizzly on show here, just a big welcoming bear-hug of fun and laughter.",Paddington
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Charming and whimsical, but disjointed and predictable.",6,17 October 2017,"The narrative is predictable and relatively one-note, with the piece feeling more like a series of independent skits wherein the eponymous CGI creation clumsily causes some cute chaos, but the piece is harmless family fun and is genuinely charming on more than one occasion, even if the actual comedy only manages to provide one or two chuckles considering most of it skews incredibly young or relies on bizarre innuendos that seem wholly out of place. It's actually rather easy to forgive the story's shortcomings, to be fair. 'Paddington (2014)' has an incredibly eclectic cast comprised of (mostly) British actors of all standings, turning the picture into a sort of 'spot the bit-part' game that's far more entertaining than it should be. The visual effects are also realistic enough to be believable while still being whimsical enough to be enjoyable. Ultimately, the picture doesn't take itself too seriously, but also can't be taken particularly seriously either. That's not really an issue if you just want some passive entertainment, but it doesn't really provide anything more than that. Still, perhaps it doesn't need to.

Although we occasionally see Mr Brown leaving for and returning from work, we never actually find out, for example, what he does for a living that enables him to live in such a spacious house in West London with a red telephone box at the end of the road.But it's about a talking bear, after all, and any grown-ups obliged to watch this with the kids will enjoy the cynical (and occasionally racy) humour; and it also boasts a foxy villainess in the form of Nicole Kidman in a blonde bob and leopard skin shoes...",Paddington
26,ThomasDrufke,More Marmalade Please,7,23 January 2015,"Not every animated kids movie can be The Lego Movie or Big Hero 6. But Paddington is a very fun film about a little (talking) bear who is taken in by a family who tries to help him find a real home. If you can get past the fact that the bear walks with two feet, talks, and dresses like a human, I think you can enjoy Paddington.I remember some of the books when I was a kid. Nothing in particular, but I do recall him needing a sandwich every once in awhile. So as far as I'm concerned, the film captured that joyous bear I remember from the books and the big heart it gave all of us while reading. The film is pretty straightforward in that it's very predictable and has a lot of the same plot notes as a Stuart Little or even Mr. Peabody and Sherman. It's really about acceptance and staying true to who you are, even if you're not even close to being like anyone else. The scenes with Paddington were always really sweet and touching. Particularly the escalator scene where Paddington seemed to take everything a bit too literally. The whole audience laughed pretty hard, myself included. I think the family dynamic was fine, but could have been explored a bit further. It was a cute film, but perhaps with more of an emotional appeal the film would have been superior. I enjoyed the connection the mother and him shared, and that would have been good groundwork for more depth to the story.Nicole Kidman played the villain. And although her character seemed to be a lot like Cruella De Vil, it worked. She was incredibly over-the-top but it somehow worked. Thinking about it, I don't really see any other way a villain would have worked in this situation. So with the film having a few hilarious moments but overall being pretty formulaic, it turned out to be a solid animated flick.+Childhood memories +Couple laugh out loud moments +Cute and cuddly bear -Would have liked to see more family material -Far too predictable 7.2/10",Paddington
27,gbill-74877,Entertaining and clever,8,22 May 2021,"Paddington doesn't break a lot of new ground, but it's warm-hearted, funny, and endlessly charming, making for entertaining family fare. The marmalade loving bear with a posh British accent stays with a family whose home is reminiscent of places seen in a Wes Anderson film, and is pursued by an evil lady who wants to kill him, kind of a mashup of Cruella de Vil with the stealth skills of Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible. He sees his old home on film and enters into the scene ala Buster Keaton, and as he tries to find the home of the old explorer, has the last on his list mistaken because of a loose number turning a 9 into a 6, an old trope. There are all sorts of things being borrowed from here and there, but the film does it very well, and with its clever dialogue and wry jokes, I didn't mind it trundling along towards a predictable ending. Sally Hawkins and Nicole Kidman are delightful as well.",Paddington

29,lesleyharris30,"Simple, Family Fun,",7,24 December 2016,"Paddington is a good movie with a well developed plot and a great cast. It is a fun,, whimsical film as we see the classic cartoon bear recreated in a live action format to excellent results. The animation of Paddington himself is incredible, somewhat life like, and Ben Whisaw provides an excellent voice over that suits the characters demeanour perfectly. However, I did find the plot to be far too straight forward, I understand it is a kids movie but there is very little twists and turns that I found it could be a little mundane for its target audience and the parents watching it with them. A very large majority of scenes take place inside the Brown house, which does become somewhat tedious. I was also disappointed by Nicole Kidman's character Millicent. She could have made a terrific villain, similar to Glenn Close's Cruella De Vil, but there were two major flaws. The first is that she does not have enough screen time to make her character developed enough, and she is also never given a proper reason to want Paddington, which makes her motives unexciting. It was as if she was never meant to be a part of the film, but was thrown in at the last minute to make things more exciting. It is a bright, colourful, feel good film that kids and kids at heart can enjoy. While it may have its flaws, it's also funny and well animated, I would recommend Paddingtom to anyone looking for a good family film. When a young bear travels to London in search of a home, he soon meets the Brown family at a train station and changes their life as they know it. Best Performance: Hugh Bonneville",Paddington

Families will love it, plus it sports beautiful , dazzling imagery",9,11 February 2015,"Paddington the bear (Ben Whishaw)lives in darkest Peru with his Uncle Pastuzo and Aunt Lucy. It is a beautiful life, high up in the rainforest, where they make their own favorite food, marmalade. Unhappily, an earthquake changes their lives. Uncle passes away and Aunt Lucy is getting old. She, therefore, sends her nephew bear to London, where a famous explorer lives. This was the geographer who traveled to their rainforest long ago. Aunt Lucy explains that she is going to a retirement home for bears and that Paddington will get adopted by a nice family, as many orphans did in WWII. Its hard to leave. But, Paddington packs his suitcase with marmalade, wears the bright red hat left by the explorer and stows away in a steamer bound for the big L. Once in Britain's capitol, however, no one seems very friendly at all. After a day of waiting at the train station, it looks hopeless. But, who should appear but Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins), her husband (Hugh Bonneville) and two lovely children. Its Mrs. B who INSISTS that the bear come home with them, despite her husband's objections. Its temporary, Mrs. B explains. A proper family will be found. Yet, one day stretches into two, then three. Yes, Paddington floods the bathroom, uses the toothbrushes for earwax removal and lights a small fire in the kitchen. But, his hat is a link to the explorer and perhaps his family would like Paddington.

The use of digital animation is clearly apparent or not apparent in this case that sweeps the audience into an almost seamless fantasy tinged world of live action Britain. Nicole Kidman quite bravely portrays a consistently cold, serious villain that seems almost unnecessarily too cold a character and perhaps a technical blip with the changing of the guard. What makes this movie brilliant is the slightly underplayed stereotypical characters so that the zany edge is taken off and allows the audience to more readily identify with these characters as their own. Underlying this movie is a simple, but potent message about family and differences which make for a tender, emotional appeal. The is hilarious, funny, and charming. The inclusion of brief animated bits makes for a superlative tribute to old animation and keeping the movie fresh and alive. What this movie represents is an superior achievement of high quality of what computers, animation, and live actors can display. This is what true movie-making is all about. The movie finally is continues the progression of the technical and acting skills fusing animation and live performances such as Ghostbusters (1984), Jumanji (1985), Jack Frost (1998).",Paddington
33,paulclaassen,Hugely entertaining!,7,25 November 2018,"I must be honest, 'Paddington' was never on my list of movies I wanted to see, so it was by chance I decided to watch it. I always thought 'Paddington' was this silly, slapstick comedy film with a ridiculous plot. I couldn't have been more wrong. Fair enough, the plot involving a family taking a bear home is not exactly ordinary story telling, let alone the fact that no-one seems to be surprised by the fact that it is indeed a bear and a talking bear at that. But maybe I enjoyed it more because a talking bear was apparently considered normal instead of the usual ""oh, you can talk"" crap.Yes, the film had a few slapstick moments, but in general this was really funny and Paddington is just the cutest, cuddliest and most adorable creature. There were even a few emotional moments and the film also has a much bigger underlying theme. Director Paul King did a styling job creating a film that is exquisitely photographed and has fantastic visuals. It is a funny, full-on adventure fantasy comedy film that delivers on every level.There are a few plot flaws and incidents that made me raise an eyebrow or two - especially in the final act - but I'll disregard these due to the film's huge entertainment value.",Paddington

35,tomgillespie2002,A delightful surprise,7,4 April 2015,"When the announcement was made of a feature-length adaptation of Michael Bond's beloved Paddington bear - the polite, marmalade- loving, bespectacled bear from deepest, darkest Peru - I'm sure the common assumption was that disaster was afoot. How do you take a character so steeped in nostalgia, some distinctively old-fashioned, and so quintessentially British, and translate it for a modern audience of children raised on multi-film franchises, CGI and fat suits? Based on the strength of the film's finished product, you employ a young, ambitious director with a real talent for visual flair.His name is Paul King, and his only previous film, Bunny and the Bull (2009), was a funny, sweet odyssey into the weird, similar in many ways to his most popular TV work, The Mighty Boosh. Paddington is an enormous step up into the mainstream, and could have easily been yet another cheap and formulaic Brit-com; films that are churned out quicker and lazier than they are placed in Asda's bargain bin. Yet despite it's thread-bare plot and familiar genre tropes, Paddington not only offers excitement in some slapstick set- pieces that will surely please the kids, but King makes the film an interesting analogy of immigration, a hot topic in modern society.When Paddington (voiced with adorable naivety by Ben Whishaw) arrives at Paddington station, leaving his Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) and Uncle Pastuzo (Michael Gambon) after an earthquake destroys his home, the image of the tiny bear, adorned with a sign around his neck asking any friendly Londoners to ""please look after this bear, thank you"", brings to mind the images of poverty-stricken immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in the 1900's as much as it does the child evacuees during World War II, Bond's original inspiration. He is taken in by inner city statistical analyst Henry Brown (Hugh Bonneville) and his wife, artist Mary (Sally Hawkins), and is soon causing chaos in their home.Evil taxidermist Millicent (Nicole Kidman) shows up about a third of the way in, intent on capturing and stuffing the rare talking bear, teaming up with grumpy (and randy) next-door neighbour Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) in what is the only contrived plot-thread of the movie. Her purpose is to be Paddington's antagonist, and it's during these scenes that the film stutters. When the focus is on the curious bear's adventures and pratfalls, and his relationship with the Brown family, this is an incredibly warm, visually engaging experience. It's peppered with wonderful moments, such as Paddington's scribbled addresses appearing out of the London skyline and the ever-changing wallpaper, which blossoms and fades to fit in with the film's various moods. This is a delightful surprise, and I'm eager to see where King will go from here.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Paddington
36,redryan64,A Total and Truly Pleasant Surprise,10,8 June 2015,"SO NOW, WE must admit that we were totally taken aback and pleasantly surprised about this one. We well recall seeing the trailers at the multiplex some months before its 1/16/15 release here in the USA. We didn't, however, choose to plunk down our hard earned buckS in order to find out about it first hand.BUT PLEASE TAKE our word for this. It is worthwhile to take the whole family to this; as it is one of those rarities today, a ""G"" rated movie! And it is one that the folks and kiddies will all enjoy.WE DO CONFESS to not really knowing very much about this character; even though he has been around since the time when we were in Junior High School. Perhaps that made us in a sort of ""Mr. In-Between"" situation, for we were too old for those books as children and were truly light-years away from having our own little ones (or as in the case of our family, Grandchildren, even!) AS FOR THE FILM, it's a sort of cross-breed of several genres. It is a true work of fantasy, which is not truly a ""children's"" story. While it is a blend of live action and computer-generated animation, it sometimes seems to be more like a Disney full length animated picture.THERE IS ALSO a strong resemblance to those various MUPPETT MOVIES and sequels. But this is of course without all of those musical production numbers.ITS FINE AND luxurious look makes it very pleasing to the eyes; which greatly enhances both its appeal as well as its effectiveness in storytelling. Added to what must be the equivalent of a production team the size of a STAR WARS, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE or RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and we have a family picture which is most pleasing to all.BEFORE WE CLOSE, we must thank the two young men who coaxed us into watching today.

37,eddie_baggins,"Light, breezy fun with some great CGI",6,16 April 2015,"It's refreshing to sit back, relax and take in the unsullied delights of such a light and breezy piece of entertainment in the form of the easy to like Paddington.I'm sure we've all seen or been fans of Paddington at some stage in our life and it's great to see him come to life in such a vivid and often in inventive fashion and much of this life comes from the energy infused direction of Mighty Boosh alumni Paul King, the wonderful CGI work of the animated bear and a great voice job by Brit Ben Whishaw as the titular marmalade loving lad. You get the feeling that there will be an abundance of children and those young at heart that will fall in love with this updated incarnation of Michael Bond's character and it's a credit to the film that they make him feel so alive. The human actors in the piece also do a fine job although it'd be wrong to say any outmatch the non-real Paddington in a story that sadly is the films major weak point.While it would be wrong to suggest that I or anyone else for that matter head into this film expecting some form of life changing narrative, the central plot devices and foils that drive the centre of this tale are sadly very far from original in a film that in many other respects creates its own beat and marches to it. Kids don't need narrative stimulation to keep them engaged and there's enough colour and gags here to keep them glued to their seats but adults here may struggle to stay engaged in an arc that seems better suited to a short film rather than a feature length experience. If Paddington had come up with a truly unique or exciting story it really would've transcended into something quite spectacular.Paddington is an enjoyable experience and one of the better mouldings of real life actors and CGI that we've seen in some time yet it's also a hollow experience that doesn't emotionally engage on the level that other more classic family tales have done. It's an absolute winner for those aged 10 or under and I'm sure long-time fans of the bear will be hugely impressed with what is a fun and breezy adventure.3 misused toothbrushes out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Paddington
38,leonblackwood,Weirdly Enjoyable! 6/10,6,28 March 2015,"Review: At 41 years old, I never thought that I would be saying that I actually enjoyed this movie. I honestly was expecting it to have childish humour and a very English storyline, but it's actually got something for the whole family and storyline was well written. It starts of with Paddington in the jungle with his family and after a earthquake, which kills his uncle, his mother decides to ship him of to London after a explorer, who taught them how to speak and read English, told them that it would be easy for them to find a home there. When his boats arrives from Peru, he's dropped of at Paddington station were he struggles to find anyone to talk to. After a while he is approached by a family who kindly takes him in, on the basis that he leaves in the morning. He then starts to look for the explorer, with the help of the family, which brings them together and makes him part of the family. There are other aspects to the story, like the villain (Kidman) who wants to stuff him and put him in a museum but I don't want to spoil the movie for people. The CGI is brilliant throughout the movie and it really does look like he is in the room with the other characters. The storyline is non-stop from the beginning and the witty script and interesting characters made it a joy to watch. The attention to detail of the bears was also very well done and Kidman suited the role as the villain. On the downside, it is a bit weird that no one says anything about a bear walking around London, speaking the Queens English but it is a kids movie so you can overlook that point. Basically it's worth a watch, even if your a bit skeptical like I was, and I'm sure that you will find aspects of the storyline, or characters that you will like. Enjoyable!Round-Up: The director really got each of the characters perfectly right and the mannerisms and voice of the bear was spot on. We have all seen Hugh Bonneville play the father in Downtown Abbey so his role as the father in the movie, really did work. Sally Hawkins was great as the mother, who took to Paddington right from the beginning, and Julie Walters was a great addition to the cast. I'm obviously not alone by thinking that this was a well made movie because of the films takings and I'm sure that we will be seeing a sequel sometime soon. I just hope that they don't spoil the franchise now that it's made such a healthy profit. Budget: $55million Worldwide Gross: $251million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/adventure movies about a bear who goes to London to find a new family after his homeland is destroyed by a earthquake. 6/10",Paddington
39,TheMovieDiorama,Paddington adds charming zest to its deliciously sweet marmalade.,8,10 April 2020,"What defines a home? Is it the delightful warmth exuding from the lavished shelter we call our abode? Or is it the accumulated heirlooms and contents that decorate the spacious rooms and hallways? For Paddington, a stowaway friendly bear shipped from darkest Peru to London, a home is defined by its residents. The welcoming tree of generations. A family. Named after the eponymous railway terminus, Paddington is temporarily adopted by the eccentric Brown family, whom attempt to find him a permanent home. A risk analyst, an illustrator, two school students and a housekeeper. Initially sceptical, Mr. Brown attempts to rid of the anthropomorphic bear immediately, due to the heightened potential risks he could cause. But, soon after the realisation that the family needs Paddington just as much as Paddington needs them, it becomes abundantly clear that the definition of ""home"" is, well, each other. Suited, booted, and ready to tackle the sprawling urban city of London, whilst trying to avoid a psychopathic taxidermist whom wants to stuff Paddington for a Natural History Museum exhibit. Old red hat. Blue duffel coat. Battered suitcase. Emergency marmalade sandwich.King's adaptation of Bond's trademark character in British literature is a prime example of understanding the source material. Whilst treading familiar narrative beats one could find in any family-friendly flick, such as the melodramatic moment of reflection and the sudden realisation when the moral of the story is spelt out during the conclusion, does supply an element of predictability, it does so with confident panache.King equips his screenplay with an abundance of British charm. From consuming tea and biscuits at an antiques shop to learning the eloquent mannerisms of typical London folk. For those uninitiated with Britain, Paddington's perspective provides a multitude of quirks and complacencies the nation takes pride in. Those of us inhabiting this rather small island will watch the feature hard staring at Paddington and how he copes with our culture, offering two distinct viewpoints. Culminating them together is a sweet, endearing and warm story about acceptance. No matter how you act. No matter how you look (even if you are a bear, but that's alright!). Family will always be there. It's a moral that sprinkles plenty of sugary goodness to retain Bond's pleasantries found in his illustrated literature.The substantial amount of memorable characterisation leaking from Paddington's marmalade sandwiches is extraordinary. Maintaining a nostalgic charm to invite adults, whilst including several scenes of sheer stupidity to entertain younger audiences. Notably the bathroom scenario, the pickpocketer chase and the discovery of sticky sellotape, all enjoyably convey Paddington's clumsiness and unfamiliarity with human society. Bolstered by an incredibly charming voice from Whishaw whom brings the legendary bear to life. Outstanding pronunciation and appropriate pitches for every type of emotion. That, and the fur-bulous (couldn't help myself...) visual effects that shaped Paddington into a lifelike miniature bear. Bonneville, Hawkins, Walters, Broadbent and Kidman all embracing the family-friendliness excellently, offering fun performances all-round. Some notable directorial flairs from King, especially the dollhouse integration to ascertain the characters of the Brown family, retain the narrative buoyancy.Overall, Paddington is the equivalent of receiving a warm embrace from your grandparents, or snuggles from your domesticated pet. It emits a sensation of comfort, leaving you with a massive smile on your face. A brilliant adaptation that, whilst familiar, accurately captures the sweet tenderness of Paddington Bear and creates an enjoyable story along the way. More importantly though, can we make ""Marmalade Day"" a bank holiday or something?",Paddington
40,matthewssilverhammer,Stylish Family Fun,8,30 January 2015,"What a novel concept, to make a family film that has humor for kids AND adults without being overly pandering or unnecessarily innuendo- filled. Hollywood filmmakers often think these two things are mutually exclusive (even in stuff I liked like this year's Penguins of Madagascar), but Paddington has the scent of the best of Pixar, wearing its heart and its humor on its sleeve, often simultaneously. Skillfully directed and impossibly enjoyable, it will leave you grinning from ear to ear. The story is fairly rudimentary: an uptight but well-meaning family welcomes in an eccentric guest (the form of a bear cub) and all their lives are turned upside down. You don't go to this movie for surprising story beats or unpredictable twists; instead, go for the bright colors and immense fun. Lead human adults Bonneville and Hawkins are fantastic, treating their roles with as much care as they might for any prestige job they may get. Antagonists Kidman and Capaldi are hilarious adversaries, cartooning-up their performances to wonderful pitches. Even the musical score is filled with oodles of charm. The film infamously had a fairly troubled production, with a revolving door of cast and crew members. Luckily, you would never know this by the film itself, a fantastic little nostalgia trip that hearkens some of the best elements of Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus, and Wes Anderson. Made with more style and care than most child-geared films, the sweet hilarity stems from inventive comedic- action and some spectacularly well-drawn characters. Tasteful, distinctive, and completely entertaining, Paddington is a family comedy that the WHOLE family can, not just endure but, really enjoy.",Paddington
41,l_rawjalaurence,Wonderfully Funny and Entertaining Film,8,9 May 2016,"Those of us who grew up with the old BBC animation of the ADVENTURES OF PADDINGTON BEAR, voiced by the wonderfully fruity Michael Hordern, might find it difficult to stomach another version of Michael Bond's well-loved tales.Happily most of our skepticism was set aside: Paul King's new animated version is absolutely wonderful, with a witty script (by King and Hamish McColl), performances given with a light touch, inspired voice-overs and superb animation.The story follows the book: Paddington Bear (voiced by Ben Whishaw) lives a happy life in darkest Peru with his aunt and uncle (voiced by Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon), until an earthquake turns their world upside down. Paddington takes a boat across to London, but finds it an unfriendly city until he settles down with the Brown family. He causes complete chaos in their household but wins his way into their hearts while repelling the evil clutches of the evil Millicent (Nicole Kidman, doing a wonderful impression of Cruella de Vil from 101 DALMATIANS).The settings are vividly colored, conjuring up an imaginative London of the mind full of gray cityscapes and ideal-looking house interiors. The Browns' residence looks an ideal place to live, with the parents (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins) leading agreeably dotty lives, and their children (Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin) falling in love with the accident-prone bear. The script contains some excruciating puns on the word ""bear,"" and includes knowing references to MISSION, IMPOSSIBLE and THE BIRDS. As the housekeeper Mrs. Bird, Julie Walters has a wonderful time with her broad Scottish accent and selection of vacuum cleaners.There are notable cameos from Matt Lucas as a timorous taxi-driver, Peter Capaldi, for once shedding his Scottish accent to play the down-at-heel neighbor Mr. Curry, and Jim Broadbent as the mittel- European immigrant Mr. Gruber.The story obviously ends happily, and contains sufficient open-ended material for the possibility of a sequel at some future date. Even if you don't have children, PADDINGTON offers ninety minutes of delightful entertainment.",Paddington
42,robert-temple-1,Sublime,10,31 March 2015,"This is one of those rare and wonderful family films which is destined to become a classic, and which will be seen again and again by successive generations over the decades to come. It is so magnificently done, that one has to struggle to find new words of praise for it. The first thing, I suppose, is to point out that the special effects, and in particular the facial expressions of Paddington the bear, reach a new height of perfection for the cinema. How marvellous it is to see special effects put to a pleasant use for a change, instead of purveying horror, violence, murder, destruction, the end of the world, and all that sort of thing which one usually sees depicted by special effects. PADDINGTON is a reminder that there are still a few sane people making big budget movies, even if they have to go under the cover of making children's' films in order to produce something wholesome. The acting by all the humans is superb. Particularly inspired is the performance by the wonderfully fey and smiling Sally Hawkins, who is perfectly cast as Mary Brown, the mother of the family who take in the refugee bear. (Strange to think that last year she was also in a monster movie remake of GODZILLA, which I shall skip seeing.) She played Jasmine in Woody Allen's failed film BLUE JASMINE (2013, see my review). This charming actress really ought to be seen more often in prominent roles, for although she has made 45 films, her name does not spring to the tongue all that readily. High Bonneville does very well at playing her husband in this film, and although looking and sounding very like Colin Firth, he does better than Firth is doing these days (see my reviews of the collapse of Firth in MAGIC IN THE MOONLIGHT and BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP, both 2014, in which Firth subsides into inanity and inertness). The film is brilliantly directed by a young chap named Paul King (see the interview with him in the DVD extras), who was a main writer on the screenplay also. The main character of Paddington Bear is of course a creation of the author Michael Bond, in his numerous famous children's books. And it seems that there is a PADDINGTON 2 coming, so we can all look forward to that. Let us hope that Paul King remains at the helm of the sequel. The story of this film portrays the adventures of the young bear of a rare species from the jungles of 'darkest Peru', whose name is unpronounceable by us stupid humans because we cannot growl properly. He manages to find his way from Peru to London where he is named after Paddington Station. (No, he was not trying to get to Somerset, he just happened to be there when the Browns got off their train at that station.) Well, why tell the story, as it spoils all the fun. The film is so enjoyable that kids will doubtless watch it over and over again. And it has a lot to offer to adults, especially those who like bears and lots of laughter. (Humourless people need not apply.)",Paddington
43,jamesrupert2014,Much better than I expected,8,3 September 2019,"A young, talking bear from Peru looks for a home in modern London. The film does a good job of updating the Paddington stories without losing their 1950's irony-free 'innocence'. Simply the fact that Paddington never once pumps his fist and says ""Yessss"" is deserving (IMO) of an extra ratings point. The movie plays around with chronology (it's hard to accept new-dad Henry Brown (Hugh Bonneville) as being a Triumph-riding hippie when his daughter must have been born around 2000) or Montgomery Clyde's (Tim Downie) sepia explorations of the Peru being in the 1970s (based on the age of his daughter)), but the film is a fantasy about a talking bear, so what harm is there in mashing timelines as long as the 'feel' of the stories isn't lost. The animation is very good and the non-CGI cast excellent. The film has a bit of a Wes Anderson look, which I liked, and, in the end I was pleasantly surprised: I expected to dislike 'Paddington' on many levels, but actually enjoyed the film thoroughly.",Paddington

It does have some adult jokes, but it would go over the kids head. I'm really surprised that in the movie when Paddington walks around the city of London, hardly anybody stares at him, like nobody is surprised that a talking bear is present.The character Paddington really comes alive, has a CGI character, and very well voiced by Ben Whishaw. The comedy is pretty good slapstick fun. And everybody seems to be real relaxed in there roles, even Nicole Kidman. Paddington is the perfect family film to take your kids to see.",Paddington
45,kevin_robbins,This is an above average family film that is definitely worth a viewing,8,21 July 2021,"Paddington (2014) is a movie I recently watched on Tubi with my daughter. The storyline follows a bear whose family met some explorers in the forest who built a bond with them and became part of the bear's extended family. The explorers return to London and inform the bears they are always welcome to visit. The bears raise a cub that hears stories of these explorers while growing up; and when the family's resources look scarce, he decides to go to London and find his family's friends. He finds this task way more daunting than he expected. This movie is directed by Paul King (Paddington 2 and the upcoming Wonka) and stars Ben Whishaw (Cloud Atlas), Hugh Bonneville (Downtown Abbey), Sally Hawkins (The Shape of Water) and Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain). The storyline for this picture is very entertaining and I loved the jungle setting in the opening. The animation style is awesome in every way and blended in with the non-animated aspects of the film perfectly. The terminology, vocabulary and accents were excellent and gave the film the proper British feel. Kidman was a great villain and nice add to the film. My only complaint was how many times did the family need to be burned to stop leaving Paddington home alone? Overall this is an above average family film that is definitely worth a viewing. I'd score this a 7.5/10.",Paddington

It is about a talking bear from Peru that journeys to London after his family suffers a tragedy. Ben furnishes the voice of Paddington. Hugh and Sally are the nice London family that takes Paddington into their home, not knowing how clumsy he is. Paddington seems to be a little accident prone; almost everything he touches ends up cascading into a horribly funny situation- not funny to the humans around him but funny to the audience watching his antics. Paddington has a big love for marmalade, he even keeps a marmalade sandwich under his hat, in case of an emergency. Nicole plays a taxidermist that has her own plans for Paddington, and they are not very nice. Paddington is done with CGI-I guess they could not find a real talking bear for the role-and he looks pretty good alongside the humans. It's rated ""PG"" for the action and some mild, rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes. I enjoyed it-and think the little ones will, too-and I would probably buy it on DVD.",Paddington
47,runamokprods,Really charming,8,19 January 2015,"A truly cute and adorable movie (and not in the nauseating way), filled with good performances, impressive animation and live action effects, witty jokes, a few well done slapstick bits and a warm heart. While primarily aimed and kids, my wife and I went along with our little niece and had a splendid time. There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, with a gentler, sweeter feel than most other 'adult friendly' kids films I've seen recently. I started out resisting, but by the end it had melted my heart. Writer/director Paul King has managed to walk the tightrope and stay true to the feel (and much of the story) of the books, without seeming to have had his hands tied. The interaction between animated bear and live action humans is as good as I've every seen that effect pulled off. Paddington seems quite alive. The whole cast seems to be having a blast, with special mention going to the always wonderful Sadie Hawkins playing the mom we all wished we had; adventurous, funny, mischievous, wise and loving. It's lovely to see her play such a non-neurotic character. And Nicole Kidman is terrific in a supporting role as the villainous Millicent, It's a bit like she took her darkly funny character from 'To Die For' and made her just over-the-top enough to work as a comic villain in a kids' film. But everyone is excellent, even the kids (a pleasure and relief to be able to report). This is one of those films that you can find things to carp about (e.g. there were a couple of visual lifts from Wes Anderson that started to go beyond 'homage'), but I don't really feel in the mood to. It made me smile. A lot. Good enough for me.",Paddington

That's because Wilbur (Ed's owner) was an American, rather than a short-sighted British Empire Imperialist (which describe BOTH PADDINGTON's would-be taxidermist, Englishwoman Millicent, and the Aussie actress who portrays her, Nicole Kidman). The English are History's greatest thieves. They stole the ""Elgin Marbles"" from Greece, the Rosetta Stone from Egypt, and America from the Indians. But PADDINGTON features the dumbest villain of all, a lady anxious to murder a bilingual bear without even discussing whether he has an agent yet. It's not as if PADDINGTON is KING KONG or GOZILLA, wreaking nonverbal havoc on entire cities. PADDINGTON simply asks politely for a warm home and orange marmalade on bread. But Kidman's character bumbles around with her EYES WIDE SHUT. The one silver lining is that she's wearing some clothes in PADDINGTON.",Paddington
49,estebangonzalez10,"Sweet, charming, but incredibly tedious",5,4 April 2015,"""Long ago, people in England sent their children by train with labels around their necks, so they could be taken care of by complete strangers in the country side where it was safe.""This quote is taken from a scene in which Aunt Lucy (voiced by Imelda Staunton), a CGI animated Bear living in a Peruvian rainforest, prepares her nephew Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw), a charming but mischievous marmalade-loving bear, to travel to London after a terrible earthquake has destroyed their home. Apparently the real life images of the children leaving the train station during the war along with a teddy bear in a store at Paddington Station is what inspired Michael Bond nearly sixty years ago to create this beloved children character which has now been brought to the big screen by director Paul King (Bunny and the Bull). To be honest, I wasn't familiar with the character and this was the first time I was introduced to his world which sort of feels like it comes from the same universe as Stuart Little where you simply have to accept the fact that it is apparently normal for a talking bear to walk around the city and be adopted by a loving family. I'm not going to jump on the Paddington bandwagon here because despite the sweet and charming story I did find it rather tedious, boring, and extremely predictable. With a 98% of critics on Rottentomatoes liking this film, I'm definitely in the minority here, but I simply didn't find it appealing. Once Paddington arrives in London he is temporary welcomed by the Brown family until he finds the explorer who had befriended his uncles forty years ago in Peru. Henry (Hugh Bonneville) and Mary (Sally Hawkins) Brown are the parents of Judy (Madeleine Harris) and Jonathan (Samuel Joslin), but other than Mary no one seems too pleased about the intrusion of Paddington in their house. Eventually they all warm up to him despite his mischievous behavior, but not everyone is as welcoming as they are. There is a museum taxidermist, Millicent (Nicole Kidman), who hears rumors that this Peruvian bear is living with the Brown family and she wants him for her personal collection. Peter Capaldi plays the role of Mr. Curry, the Brown's next door neighbor who is willing to help Millicent take the bear away from his neighborhood, while Jim Broadbent is Mr. Gruber, an antique shop owner who tries to help Paddington locate the mysterious explorer. It is evident that the film has an underlying message about the poor way in which immigrants are treated. Paddington is a beloved and charming character that will easily win the hearts of children. The story follows pretty much the same basic formula as most classic children films did. Visually the movie is very stylish and there are several set designs that reminded me of Wes Anderson's work. Especially those scenes where he uses rostrum camera insert shots to animate several objects. I'll give King credit for those visually beautiful scenes, but I simply didn't feel engaged with the characters as most people did. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I had never heard of Paddington before, but as a film on its own it definitely didn't stand out for me.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Paddington

He gets a rude shock when he gets there, however, and winds up being looked after by a nice family and being given the name Paddington after the train station.

51,kluseba,Bears are the better human beings,8,1 February 2018,"Usually, I'm not a very nostalgic person and I'm certainly not a person who watches Dinsey films as an adult. However, Michael Bond's Paddington has always fascinated me since my early childhood. The idea of an innoent bear from darkest Peru integrating into British society has intrigued me much. The novels have a lot of creativity and soul as they offer beautiful life experiences and valuable morals. Since I have always loved animals, it wasn't a surprise that I was always rooting for the sympathetic young bear.In many cases, live-action or CGI animated movies fail to capture the essence of the novels they were inspired by. To my very positive surprise, this is an entirely different thing for this particular movie. The animated bear looks splendid and the actresses and actors around him do a very credible job, making us believe that the young bear is truly around them. Paddington doesn't look out of place in contemporary London and actively interacts with his diversified surroundings.The story is nicely crafted as well. It tells us the sad yet hopeful background story of the charming young bear in a concise way. We then explore how the bear finds a new home, new friends and new experiences in London. There are many humorous scenes that put a constant smile upon your face such as Paddington taking a bath in a very chaotic way. Despite creating so much chaos, the young bear changes people around him in a very positive way. On the other side, the movie also has a dramatic side as Paddington is trying to find out more about his origins and comes across a pitiless taxidermist who stuffs exotic animals. The mixture of light-hearted comedy, gripping drama and surprisingly humane life lessons from a young bear is absolutely splendid.As someone who isn't nostalgic, I was truly moved by this film and enjoyed it from start to finish. The makers of this movie have managed to recapture the magic of the novels and bring them onto screen. Paddington is a very rewarding experience for younger and older viewers. If you aren't familiar with Paddington at all, you have missed out on something and discovering this fascinating franchise will change your mind about children's literature. In times, when cinemas are flooded with gruesome Battle Royale copies, it's refreshing to go back to such a classic franchise with a pure message. Watching this movie will make you feel like an innocent child again. Bears are the better human beings.",Paddington

Every actor here was great, Nicole Kidman was the absolute best Of course, I expected that. That brings me to my favorite part of the movie, which was Nicole's performance as Millicent, she really killed it as the evil taxidermist. Sally Hawkins was also very enjoyable, along with her husband in the film. The animation of Paddington and the other bears was very sharp as well. It did have some pretty good humor, and I really enjoyed climax of the film, when they have a face off with the villain (Nicole Kidman), yes it be a little cliché, but I enjoyed it. 7/10 for Paddington, not great, not bad, just pretty good.

He tells the bears that if ever they get to London, he will be more than happy to take them in. One day, after a strong earthquake causes the death of his beloved Uncle, a young bear decides to stowaway on a ship to go to London to find a better life for himself.In London, a friendly family, the Browns, decide to take him in. They named the bear after the train station they found him in, Paddington. The father Henry is always wary of his family's safety, while the mother Mary is more welcoming and warm. The daughter Judy is a whiz with languages, while the son Jonathan is a genius with mechanical matters. While searching for the elusive Mr. Clark, Paddington crosses paths with Millicent, a sadistic taxidermist who wants to make him a stuffed bear, for more reasons than it would seem.I only knew Paddington Bear as a piece of childhood trivia. I never really knew him, other than the fact that he was a cute little British teddy bear with a hat and overcoat. I have not read any of the books by Michael Bond and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum, which was first published back in 1958. This film was my first formal introduction to this beloved character and I clearly can see why he has endured through the years. He is truly adorable! His childlike innocence is heartwarming and delightful. It is to the credit of Xian Lim, who voiced Paddington in the local release. Lim does not really have a truly distinctive recognizable voice. However, more importantly, he was able to convey the most essential heart and spirit of Paddington. In the original British version, Paddington was voiced by Ben Whishaw. It appears they have a different voice actor per country of release, an interesting publicity gimmick.Like ""Roger Rabbit"", ""Space Jam"" and ""Garfield"" before it, the animated Paddington flawlessly interacts with live human actors. ""Downton Abbey"" actor Hugh Bonneville plays a stern but kind Henry Brown. ""Happy Go Lucky"" actress Sally Hawkins plays the quirky and happy Mary Brown, she who always wore red. Madeleine Harris and Samuel Joslin play the two Brown children. Two-time Oscar-nominated actress Julie Walters as plays Mrs. Bird, the loyal housekeeper of the Browns. Nicole Kidman plays the cruel Millicent with so much evil relish, it is fun to watch her. Her final scene is hilarious! Other esteemed British actors fill out the other character roles. Jim Broadbent plays Samuel Gruber, friendly antique shop owner. Peter Capaldi plays the Brown's annoying neighbor, Mr. Curry. Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon provide the voices of Paddington's Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo back in Peru.Be you a long-time fan or first time viewer, this ""Paddington"" will endear himself to you. His antics, mishaps and misadventures were so well-executed by director Paul King, who also wrote the script together with Hamish McColl. The timelessness of the story and characters is also reflected in the wonderful production design which mixed elements from various decades seamlessly. Some moments as the story turns dark can be scary for very young kids so parental guidance is recommended. Overall though, be prepared to enjoy and be enthralled this very charming piece of British comedy. 9/10.",Paddington

57,jadepietro,Bear-y Entertaining,6,2 July 2015,"This film is recommended.In brief: Modern updating loses some charm from the original source, but enough visual cleverness survives.GRADE: B- Poor Paddington! He had a makeover in this updated version of the popular 1950's Michael Bond stories. He still has his signature red hat, battered suitcase, and blue overcoat, plus his overall cuteness, but his misadventures are stuffed with more pop references, modern days songs, and silly slapstick chase scenes than his unlimited supply of marmalade could handle. It's a sticky situation indeed!Written and directed by Paul King, Paddington still has a enjoyable whimsical streak. Visually, the live action CGI works very well and King's vision of stark primary colors and imaginative out-of-kilter signature moments (a doll-house opening up to the Brown household, sepia- toned newsreel footage of Paddington's past life, fallen leaves from a wall mural) give the film a unique look before it descends into a 101 Dalmatian rip-off, complete with a Cruella DuVille villain out for revenge. (Special mention goes to Gary Williamson's grand production design and Erik Wilson's fine cinematography for creating a Wes Anderson-style universe.)For those who may not know the story, Paddington is sent to London and adopted by the Brown Family, a properly British clan: uptight father, bohemian mother, and their two lovable children, Jonathan and Judy. Of course, our furry friend gets into all sorts of trouble with his new life in London, but his mishaps bring the family closer together. The problem with this film adaptation is that its central plot panders away its cleverness by relying too heavily on action sequences that might delight the youngest of moviegoers and bore anyone above the age of 6. The screenplay concentrates less on the relationship between our pint-size hero and his new family, which made the original source so endearing. The cast bring the right level of energy to the proceedings: Hugh Bonneville (playing the no- nonsense patriarch once again, but with enough comic edge this time around), Sally Hawkings, Julie Walters, Peter Capaldi, and Jim Broadbent are all appealing. Nicole Kidman has the thankless role of the evil Millicent but the actress brings enough camp appeal to the role. The film also boasts some wonderful voice-over work from Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon as Paddington's aunt and uncle from ""dark Peru"". Foremost is Ben Whishaw's contribution as Paddington Bear, a perfect blending of tonal innocence and childlike wonder. It gives so much believability to this beloved character.The film has more than its share of dazzling animation.

58,Seraphion,Very funny and enjoyable family entertainment,7,24 December 2014,"After a visit from an England explorer years ago and losing his uncle in his hometown in Peru, a young bear is smuggled in a life boat to London. Hiding in a mail bag, he gets stranded at Paddington station where he meets the Brown family who is willing to help him find the explorer, and also give him an English name Paddington according to the station. Paddington does many mischiefs in the Brown residence, mainly due to culture shock. But when visiting an antique shop to get information about the explorer according to his hat, he gets to be an accidental hero catching a pickpocket. He also manages to convince Mr. Brown to help him and even t go the distance in retrieving the explorer's name from an archive. But on the other hand, there's Millicent who is very interested to get Paddington to add him as her museum's collection. She uses a neighbor of the Browns Mr. Curry due to Mr. Curry likes her. When the Browns are away, Millicent breaks in and tries to kidnap Paddington. The bear manages to elude her but his efforts leave a big mess to the house. The Brown's can't simply trust Paddington when he explains who did the mess. Overhearing Mr. Brown saying he can't really trust him, Paddington leaves the Brown residence quietly to look for Montgomery Clyde the explorer. After many wrong addresses, Paddington finds the place of Montgomery Clyde. But the explorer has died and it turns out that Millicent is his daughter. She tricks the bear into her car where she meets Mr. Curry and she tells him her plans to stuff the bear up. Mr. Curry tells the Browns about Millicent. It turns out that the expedition Montgomery Clyde did years ago was never believed to be true because he refused to take a sample of the new species he found, that means stuffing one of the talking bears. Millicent vows to finish what her father couldn't do. The Browns reach the museum and manages to wake Paddington from sleep. But Millicent finds out about them and chases the bear. The Browns saved Paddington from falling off a chimney, but Millicent had them cornered. The bear tricked her by creating a smoke screen of pigeons and Mrs. Bird accidentally tosses Millicent off the roof. The Browns finally give Paddington a home with them.The story nicely takes on an oldies classic doll show an successfully reintroduces it as a great comedy with very laughable sequences. But besides focusing on being funny, the story also nicely adapts itself so that it looks almost entirely logical. For me the only illogical thing within the story is the basic premise that there is a species of an intelligible bear that can learn to speak. Yet when we come to think of it, that basic premise is indeed quite funny in itself.The comedy rely mostly on practical comedic moments, in long sequences or just as instances. And the whole lot of them starts as Paddington having really heavy dose of culture shock of never having encountered human civilization in a city before, despite being able to speak fluent English and knowing some nice gestures of English manners. Personally I like the early on Pastuzo's classic 'liquid in the hat' instance, The pigeons ganging up demanding the sandwiches every time Paddington opens up his marmalade sandwich stash, and of course the crazy sequence of Paddington as a cop.Focusing mostly on the bear's funny incidents doesn't really leave the rest of the cast out of the spotlight. I find the acting overall to be quite good. Ben Whishaw nicely put his sound to complete the CGI bear Paddington's character. Hugh Bonneville did his parts nicely, especially when his acting is in tandem with Paddington in making it a funny moment in the scenes at the archives. Sally Hawkins also nicely provides the link to the Brown family in her character. Having Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent completes the spectrum stretch well enough. Nicole Kidman's role really completes the angle needed for the classic resolve of the story.My final say for Paddington (2014) is a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation. This movie is a great entertainment for all ages and best be watched together with the rest of the family.",Paddington

This film is playful, comedic, enjoyable and definitely a great film for friends and family.Paddington (Ben Whishaw, voice) is a rare breed of bear that travels all alone to London. He wants to find a home after his is destroyed. While there, he discovers that it's not what he expects, but finds a family that's willing to take him in and look after him for just a little while. This is when everyone's adventure begins.Paddington is so outgoing and adorable. You can't help but love this bear. He has an innocent way about him, but still is a little mischievous and gets into trouble. His visual effects and fur looks very real and life-like. Nicole Kidman's character (Millicent) is very determined to add Paddington to her collection of stuffed animals. She will stop at nothing to get him. She's fierce, frightening and intimidating. I love the story line, humor, and definitely the action. I liked that the climax of this film is very unpredictable and shocks the audience. My favorite character would have to be Paddington. He truly thinks of the wellbeing of others and his curiosity is adorable. He reminds you of a child learning new things. A scene that I would call my favorite is when Paddington tries to return a wallet to a man that dropped out of his packet while walking out of an antique shop. Paddington chases him, trying to get the wallet to him. Finally he catches up with the man by falling on him from the air. When he falls on the man they both tumble down and about 30 wallets fall out of the man's coat. Paddington catches a pickpocket and ends up in the paper on his first day in London. It's a very comical scene that makes the audience crack up. One of the messages of this film is that families are not just made up by the people who are related to us, but friends and even animals can be a part of our family.I recommend Paddington for ages 8 to 16. However it's great for the whole family and anyone who loves Bears. It's rated PG and there's nothing really you would need to look out for.I give it 5 out of 5 stars. It's a great film that makes you feel good.",Paddington

62,Sergeant_Tibbs,Harmless family fluff.,6,8 December 2014,"Paddington is such a cherished part of British culture that at the first sign of a film adaptation it was met with groans. They grew even louder when we had our first glimpse of their live-action rendition of what Paddington would look like. Given that he's been translated from the page into stop motion animation, 2D animation and various stuffed animals, there isn't much reason to be so protective over his image. And here in Paul King's version paired with Ben Whishaw's voice, it's a solid representation of the bumbling yet polite character. It's easy to see why this film has charmed critics and the public, especially with low expectations going in. If there's one thing to take away from it, it's to never underestimate the scale of a David Heyman produced film. It's slick and cinematic, with the colour, vibrancy and scope of a classic 60s musical. If there's one thing that the film does right, it's the cinematography and production design. But naturally, it's all very familiar storytelling but it's not as smooth as it could be. Typical characters abound that burst out of their established development for no reason other than it serves a joke. It's a shame, it could've had a bigger more authentic heart. Otherwise, Paddington is harmless family movie fluff.6/10",Paddington
63,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Ridiculously Lovable Film.,9,24 October 2017,"Paddington plays like a modern British fairytale, and boy does this film brim with gorgeous colours, great actors and some truly great and charming CG-animation bringing the world's favourite Maramalade-eating bear to the big screen.Paddington is 'jolly-good-stuff' that is as British as British family films and comedy gets: full of down to earth yet relatable and sometimes self-mockery. Paddington you could swear was at least partially funded or meddled by American hands, but that is not the case here. One of the UK's most famous literary icons gets transformed into a believable and modern animal that feels like he's in a story custom-made as creative yet cinema-referential; it has great charm and feelings reminiscent to the Harry Potter films in its giddiness, like The Jungle Book in the opening sequence, and the benefits of gorgeous London-based scenery that drives the story complimented by the occasional homage to the Mission Impossible movies.Paddington: I expected a kid's movie that would be enjoyable and harmless; it's charm may just about make those rough-gutted moviegoers out there real sick. Overall it's an absolute joy and feel-good movie where you can be absolutely sedated by its stress-free story and characters. It's happy cinema done right.",Paddington
64,Troy_Campbell,Simply delightful.,8,19 December 2014,"With the Christmas holidays upon us, so too is an array of kiddie-friendly flicks, beginning with this very British adventure designed to adore the socks off kids and adults alike. Based on the immensely popular talking bear of the title, this modern update could have been saccharine, morally burdensome and unbearable for anyone older than 8. But in striking a fantastic balance between old-fashioned innocence and contemporary sensibilities, writer-director Paul King has dished up a motion picture that is fun, light-hearted and just plain sweet. He's helped by a game cast: be it the affable pair of Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins as Paddington's adopted guardians, the gleefully menacing Nicole Kidman as a malevolent taxidermist, or amusing old- timers Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent who light up the screen with their eclectic supporting characters. Yet nobody can outshine the cute little fur-ball at the centre of proceedings. Voiced by Ben Whishaw (after an 11th hour change from Colin Firth) and carefully crafted with CGI, ol' Paddy is utterly delightful and a wonderful companion for 95 minutes. There are flaws to be found and the laughs may not come thick and fast, but Paddington will melt the heart of even the toughest cynic.",Paddington

What isn't there to like? A charming bear on an adventure packed full of action and fun. Paddington might be targeted at kids but it can be enjoyed by all and I certainly did.Bear aside, I was impressed with the design, graphics and of course the London scenery. Everything was spot on in that department and the film is visually beautiful. The acting and voice overs were all excellent too, contributing to a thoroughly enjoyable film.Paddington is a great 90 minutes of entertainment packed full of laughs, action and adventure.

66,Stephen_A_Abell,Paddington - Simply The Best.,10,19 December 2016,"Watched it - LOVED it - Bought it.What else can I say to recommend this beautiful, hilarious movie?I, like most people, watched the ""leaked"" bathroom scene on youTube and pretty much pee'd myself with laughter (not too cool a thing to do as I was at work at the time). However, I thought that if the studio had leaked this clip to stir up interest then the rest of the film would probably not be so good. This thought stopped me from watching the film until it was recently aired on TV, and I fell in love with the film.It is a superbly crafted work of art. The story sticks to the main Paddington tale and adding the conflict of trying to find the adventurer and escaping the evil Millicent (though why you'd want to run from Nicolle Kidman is beyond me :-) ) was imaginative and attention grabbing.The CGI works were awesome, and I don't just mean Paddington, which was beyond excellent, (this is how Yogi & Boo Boo should've looked) but all the little things, the placenames when he's searching for the adventurer. The best effect for me was the ""Autumn"" of the staircase tree. This was both beautiful and emotive.The acting was superb and credit and respect to the actors for making us believe there really was a bear standing in front of them. Not one actor stood out above the others, each did a brilliant job with their characterisations. Though I do have a fondness for Julie Walters' Mrs. Bird. It was also nice to hear Nicolle Kidman do a very passable English accent.The direction was tight and expertly done to tie in the CGI so seamlessly while keeping to the feeling and personifications of the cast.This is a brilliant, humorous, feel good film which has made it into my top ten.",Paddington
67,brchthethird,Won me over with its charming nature,7,19 May 2015,"It's easy these days to be cynical about children's entertainment, or really entertainment in general. What, with sequels, remakes, reboots, etc., it seems like money is all people think about and we don't help them when we just go and see whatever they vomit up for us to watch. And then there's PADDINGTON. Yes, it's based on preexisting source material, but there's an affection for its central character that comes across despite leaning on common narrative tropes. It also helps that the film has a great message that will speak to adults and children alike. For those uninitiated (like myself, before watching this), PADDINGTON is about the titular bear who hails from ""Darkest Peru"" and travels to London to find himself a home. He ends up staying with a family who finds him at the train station, initially on a temporary basis, but the family grows to love and appreciate him. There's also an evil taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) who's trying to get her hands on him, and with whom he shares an interesting connection. That's all you really need to know going in, especially if you've seen the trailer already. Far and away the best thing about the film is Ben Whishaw, who provides the voice-over for Paddington. He did a great job conveying the innocence and politeness that are a huge part of the character. Of course, the animators did a bang-up job as well, and this is some of the best CGI/live-action integration I've ever seen. The rest of the cast does quite well for themselves, too, even if their characters are a bit ""stock"" in nature and go through typical transformations over the course of the film. Nicole Kidman was good too, but her character really isn't given much screen time, or much to do at all for that matter. She gets one big scene in which she reveals something I won't spoil here, but I called the twist when she was first introduced and its revelation left me wondering ""That's it?"" However, villain underdevelopment and narrative tropes aside, this was a very pleasant and funny film to watch. There are a number of scenes with some absolutely hysterical physical comedy, and some small details which end up getting satisfactory payoffs later. And most of all, I liked the messages about treating people with kindness and the nature of family. There's even a bit of subtext about immigration that might go over children's heads, but that parents will hopefully pick up on. Overall, I don't think is some masterpiece. The plot bears (no pun intended) a slight resemblance in some respects to Beethoven, although it's arguably done better here. What is true is that PADDINGTON is a refreshingly positive and heartwarming experience that should appeal to all ages, and that's something to be proud of.",Paddington

It also begins with an interesting observation: that modern England is much less friendly and more hurried than the England of the past (post-WW2).This theme stops short, unfortunately, while the movie falls into the expected chaotic slapstick.

71,sharky_55,Probably selling something.,8,9 December 2017,"Paddington begins by drawing attention to a set of old fashioned ideals on style, behaviour and propriety, and hopes that the current generation might learn a lesson or two. Disarmed of his rifle, explorer Montgomery Clyde finds that even in deeper, darkest Peru a bit of British hospitality doesn't go amiss, a cup of tea and a jar of delicious marmalade all that is needed to make lifelong friends. The opening scene is a whimsical delight harking back to the silent movie era, with a boxed-in frame, fuzzy faux black and white footage, and oodles of slapstick humour to start us off. And later, when Aunt Lucy farewells Paddington on his trip across the Pacific to find a new home in London, she fastens a tag with a simple plea that pays homage to not only Michael Bond's original children's novel, but also a time where the kindness and generosity of strangers shone through the darkness of the Blitz. Many have noted the film's allegorical association of Paddington's journey to the immigrant experience, and what's especially impressive is the ease in how the message of humanity and compassion is given universal appeal through the children's format of live action/animation blend. It pays close attention to how often these figures are marginalised and pushed aside upon arriving and trying to settle into the dominant culture, so much so that they become almost invisible. The film's usage of gentle magical realism is the best I have seen since that of Lars and the Real Girl, where a talking bear is treated as an unusual but not impossible occurrence, and as merely another strange creature washed up upon the shores of Thames here to steal local jobs (and clog drains with fur, throw buns at old ladies, throw picnics all night - the script poking fun at the slippery logic of anti- immigration rhetoric, with Kidman selling it with mock seriousness). See what Henry whispers to his family and how he ushers them quickly past the sight of the crestfallen Paddington, as if he was not a sentient, anthropomorphic animal, but something of a dirty foreign nuisance. It's not the bear aspect of his character that bothers the London residents, but the fact that he is an outsider. The script is witty enough that every time we think that we've gotten the film categorised and figured out (cliches abound initially: the strict, paper-pusher father who eventually warms to the chaotic intruder, and we all just know what will happen when Paddington visits the bathroom for the first time), it flips those expectations on their heads and has us giggling in another way. There's a double blow early; Paddington, voiced by the delicate Ben Whishaw, is all charm and manners upon arriving in London, until he's asked his name and roars indecipherably before chugging down from a teapot whilst scolding Henry for his rudeness. The most moving of these moments comes when the family gathers round to watch Clyde's old explorer footage from Peru, and a mesmerised Paddington reaches out to touch the jungle on the projector. You'd expect slapstick here, for his paw to go right through and poke a hole, or for him to stumble around and set the room on fire. Instead, he slips through seamlessly, and in a magical moment is transported right back to the colourful jungle where he was raised. By the end he's found something different but just as welcoming - a family and home to call his own.",Paddington
72,RforFilm,"Grab your raincoat and marmalade, because Paddington will delight you",8,18 January 2015,"Something that I've noticed out of children's literature is that there whenever animals are talking and playing essential characters, there are three types that authors will write. The first are birds; it doesn't matter what kind of bird, but I see plenty of birds from sparrows to flamingos to blue jays replaying human problems. Next up are rabbits. These big eared mammals seem to be very popular in the cute and cuddly department and provide much entertainment from Peter Rabbit to Bugs Bunny. What I think is the most popular (and frankly, overused) animal happen to be bears. Who would have thought that despite being one of the most dangerous animal on the planets, we have created a new identity for bear; as wholesome and innocent. A lot of this stems from the image of the Teddy bear toy which tends to be one of the first things people play with. There seen in fairy tales like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. There seen in picture books like my personal favorite, the Berenstain Bears. Their seen in short stories like Little Bear. One such bear that's also popular is Paddington Bear, a British character that I'm not too familiar with. He finally receives a feature film adaption in Paddington. Starting in the deepest jungles of Peru, we come across a family of bears that seems to be intelligent, speak English and has a fondness for marmalade. The older bears, Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo, live in a big tree house along with their young nephew. An earthquake destroys their home along with the loss of their uncle. Lucy takes the young bear to the ship docks to be taken to London as they were told by an explorer that they are welcome. The cub is given his uncles hat and a suitcase full of marmalade as he crosses the sea. He lands in Britton without notice and finds himself in the Paddington train station where he looks for a new home. While waiting on the sidelines, the Brown family has returned from a vacation where they see the bear and while the rest of the family including mother Mary (played by Sally Hawkins) wants to take in the bear, the father Henry (played by Hugh Bonneville) wants nothing of it. The bear is given his English name Paddington, and taken in to find the explorer that found them years ago. Meanwhile, a museum taxidermist, Millicent Clyde (played by Nicole Kidman) wants the bear to stuff and add to the collection. What surprises me about Paddington is that I probably should not like the movie as it engages in the trope of convincing the parent to keep the pet (something like in Beethoven). But for some reason, I found myself really liking this movie. It idea here is nothing new, but it seems fresh because of two things; the pet in question and the writing.Paddington himself is a very likable bear, very curious and naive, and tends to make mistakes, but always remains optimistic. Think of him as a smarter Winnie the Pooh. Something like Paddington could have been a goofier children's film had it been produced here in the U.S., but being produced by the U.K. has given this film to keep is charming roots and bring him into the twenty-first century. Though there are a few gag's that could have been cut, the slapstick is actually well thought out and almost as funny as The Three Stooges. When I mean that the film is British is an understatement. I can understand why some kids may not get the dry humor and over tone present, but should you enjoy something like Monty Python and Black Adder, you'll probably enjoy this more then you think. I'll give this eight Paddingtons out of ten. This is a family film that I strongly recommend. Though the adults are not going to find that many adult jokes (good thing too), I think they'll be surprised by how much they'll like his bear.",Paddington

74,natashabowiepinky,More Than Bearable...,6,29 May 2015,"While I feel that the story of a family adopting a CGI animated animal was done better in Stuart Little, Paddington was still fun to watch, especially if you're a Londoner... Since it makes extensive use of familiar locations and native speak which some overseas audiences might not get. The story (such as it is) is mainly an excuse for Paddington to get up to his usual disruptive shenanigans, but kids will eat up his light-hearted antics, while adults won't be too bored with the odd grown-up joke thrown their way, and Nicole Kidman as a bleached blonde ruthless huntress.A couple of pieces of interest: It's funny how no-one reacts to having an intelligent, talking bear around. If Kidman had ANY sense, she'd put the titular ursine on display in a cage, not mount and stuff him. No sense of business practice, some people. And, what exactly is the appeal of marmalade? I don't eat the peel of my orange with the innards... So why would I want to stick it in my sandwich?

79,Likes_Ninjas90,If it spikes the interest of small children to read more of his books then maybe there's lasting value in the film,6,21 December 2014,"Paddington Bear is a children's literary character, dressed in a blue duffle coat and red hat, with a strict appetite for marmalade. British author Michael Bond conceived the character in 1958. The idea of a bear from Peru struck him after buying a teddy bear for his wife from a London shop near Paddington station. Bond has written over twenty books about Paddington and sold more than thirty-five million copies. That's a lot of marmalade. Paddington is a universally accepted story because the books have been translated into more than forty languages. This is the first Paddington film and one which has been in production since 2007. It is also French company StudioCanal's most expensive film to date, costing $50 million dollars. Paddington combines CGI with live action. Paddington himself is animated by British visual effects studio Framestore, who designed Dobby the House Elf for the Harry Potter films, and they have seamlessly blended animation with real actors.The film has a simple storybook premise. Following an earthquake in Peru, Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw, replacing Colin Firth) leaves behind his Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) who is staying in a retirement home for bears, and travels to London to search for an explorer he once knew. Alone at a station, Paddington has a tag on him asking to give him a home. A family passes him by because the father Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville), a risk analyst, doesn't want anything to do with him. He's ultra conservative and determined to avoid taking chances in his life. But the mother Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins), who illustrates adventure stories, decides they're going to house him for one night. Their two children Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) and Judy (Madeline Harris) become increasingly attached to the bear. Together with their housekeeper Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) the Brown family helps Paddington find clues to the explorer. Meanwhile, Millicent (Nicole Kidman) who collects and stuff animals uses some high tech gadgets and the help of the nosey neighbour Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) to spy on Paddington. She hatches a plan to kidnap the bear.Director Paul King, who made Bunny and the Bull and episodes of the TV show The Mighty Boosh, brings an ease to the proceedings. The tone and look of the film is comical and light, and the cast, particularly the parents, are charming and having fun. The jokes in the script by King also land at a surprisingly high percentage rate. The comedy is a result of clever, silly quips and physical comedy. Some of the gag scenes are taken from the books like when Paddington overflows the bathtub and has to ward off a loose shower head. There's a lot of slapstick, true to the chaos the childlike Paddington can create, but the laughs are mostly drawn from the dialogue. Sharp action pacing ensures the film moves briskly over its brief running time. The only major drawback is the jokes are wrapped inside a basic narrative, driven conventionally by MacGuffin devices and action set pieces. More surprises or detours wouldn't have gone astray with the family's character development, as they realise all too predictably it might not have been the bear that needed them the most. But there is a flashback to Mr. Brown's past which is hilarious and unexpected. Paddington is highly typical of a lot of family films today, embedding themes like family building and social inclusiveness. Bond has given the film his approval and if it spikes the interest of small children to read more of his books then maybe there's lasting value in the film.",Paddington

The movie follows an animated bear as he finds a new home after a catastrophe. Along the way, he encounters a family that takes him in until Paddington can find information about an explorer. Meanwhile a villainess wishes to capture Paddington.Paddington is an enjoyable movie. Although aimed at children, the movie can be enjoyed by adults. It touches themes such as abandonment and family. The movie starts by pulling at these themes to drive both audience involvement and Paddington's motivation. The movie is also quick to be light-hearted so as to not drive children away. One of the ways the movie does this is by Paddington's love of marmalade. Paddington, the Brown family, and the villainess are well-realized characters that have their own motivations of helping or hurting Paddington. Mr. Brown, the father of the house, becomes more endearing as the movie continues. Nicole Kidman as the taxidermist that wants to kidnap Paddingotn is incredibly charming in the role. When her motivation is revealed, the audience could understand her goal. Paddington is of course a well-likable character that is animated well.I highly recommend Paddington for being a great movie for any audience.I watched this movie on Amazon Prime and the video quality could be better. The video suffered from artifacts that appear randomly. There was some skipping, but none of this hurts the enjoy-ability of the movie.Grade: A",Paddington
82,griffolyon12,"Movie Review: ""Paddington""",10,17 January 2015,"Children's literature is full of talking bears, but there is only one Paddington. After decades of TV adaptations, Michael Bond's creation finally finds his way to the bigscreen courtesy of producer David Heyman (the man responsible for the Harry Potter series). With the unique talents of Mighty Boosh writer/director Paul King, Paddington manages to be an inventive children's film that rivals the classic slapstick comedies of the Marx Brothers, while also retaining the innocence and charm that makes Paddington one of my personal childhood favorites.The thing that separates Paddington from the pack of almost every other children's movie, is that everything in this movie feels like it was carefully thought out. We are told how Paddington and his Aunt and Uncle in Peru learned how to speak English, thanks to a British explorer who tells them that they will always be welcome in London. When Paddington must relocate, he discovers London isn't as friendly as they thought. Even still, he meets the Brown family, the kind of Mary Poppins-like family that only works in movies. The Browns ultimately take in Paddington as their houseguest until he can track down the British explorer. Safe to say, hijinks ultimately ensue as Paddington becomes the ultimate immigrant.I just have to say, Paul King has directed a film that is genuinely as magical as the books upon which it was based. King gives Paddington this sense of cartoonish whimsy that allows you take everything that the story does seriously. Very often, movies mess up when trying to basically make a live action cartoon, and that is because they often don't make the story enough of a fantasy and too realistic. This story accepts the absurdity of a talking bear and never really comments on it or pokes fun at the idea. From the moment Paddington first arrives in King's Cross station, there is never a human that is confused by the sight of a talking bear. This allows the audience to go along with the fantastical visuals that King uses to illustrate the story, recalling directors like Wes Anderson and Michel Gondry with a lot of King's off the wall visual concepts. For example, when the camera goes toward a doll house and then the house unfolds revealing the Browns inside their own home, I was speechless as we see what each and every member of the family is doing in their individual rooms. I was also amazed at how every set and costume was meticulously color coded by King and his collaborators, with the color red representing adventurous thinking (sported for most of the movie by Mrs. Brown), and the color blue often representing the established order (most often sported by Mr. Brown). Of course, the true test of making a movie about Paddington was going to be in whether or not the filmmakers would be able to pull off Paddington himself, and they do.VFX house, Framestore, has created a CGI Paddington that is able to interact with the humans and do all of the crazy fun things he does in this movie. However, what really brings Paddington to life is the voice. The voice was the killer thing that the filmmakers knew they had to get right, because if you chose the wrong voice, Paddington wouldn't have the sweetness that he needs to be lovable. The voice of Paddington was under much scrutiny when last year it was announced that Colin Firth amicably left the project because he and the filmmakers decided that his voice just wasn't fitting well with Paddington. While I would be curious to see the version of Paddington with Firth's voice, I must say it would be hard to imagine. Firth's voice is a lot more grown up sounding than that of his replacement, Ben Whishaw's. Whishaw's voice has a youthful sound to it that makes Paddington sound a whole lot more innocent and naive, but no less kind or gentle. It is with Whishaw that the success of this movie really relied upon, and thankfully he delivered, but that's not to say the rest of this cast aren't good. Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins manage to sell the wacky ideas of this film by playing Mr. and Mrs. Brown deadly serious. Then there is Nicole Kidman as an evil taxidermist, who is evil, but never hammy. In short, the cast coupled with King and the work of the VFX crew, bring to life a new children's classic.I really think Paddington is the sort of movie that appeals to all. The jokes in it are funny no matter how old you are, and the thematic ideas of isolation and home are so universal that anyone can relate to them. The movie made me laugh extremely hard, while also touching me and inspiring me. Few movies nowadays actually make you optimistic about the world we live in and make you smile and feel good about yourself and humanity in general. That's what Paddington does wholeheartedly. Just a note, this movie is best watched with a marmalade sandwich (not that I am proposing you sneak food into a movie theater) .",Paddington
83,Imdbidia,Magical,9,29 April 2017,"One of the things I resent the most in modern children's film and stories and in modern animation is that they can be visually enthralling but have not magic, no soul or no charm. I also dislike the fact that too many fables and old-books stories are brought to the screen with no soul and respect for the original characters and stories. To my delight, this is not Paddington's case.Paddington is a brilliant exception to the dullness, soulless bunch of animated movies for kids out there. This is so mostly so because the original story is there, Paddington and the the Brown's family's souls and personalities are there, they feel modern and contemporary, but not too far removed from the original. Pablo Grillo's animation is fantastic per se, but there are many amazing animators out there; what sets this film animation apart is the magic infused into it, so we come to see Paddington as Paddington, not as a puppet, not as a CGI character, not as a fictional. Paddington feels real in this movie, as real as any of the actors.The ambiance of the film is whimsical, it mixes elements that are very modern but also capturing a bit of the old London where the original story is set. The film has a great tempo, is full of fancy and fun, innocence and naughtiness, havoc and tenderness, action and stillness, happiness and sadness, adventure, laughter and family love. The cast in this film is great, per se, but that not always guarantees a good movie in the end. However, all the actors are great and believable in this film. I especially liked Nicole Kidman in her evil sassy ruthless manipulative and sweet villain role. The music is also fantastic with plenty of Latin rhythms throughout the film. Paddington is Peruvian, after all.Paddington is not only a very sweet, fun an enjoyable film. It also has a great message about accepting those who are different and welcoming those who need of our care because have nowhere to go; two things that we should be reminded of in these troubled times when refugees are sometimes treated as an ""it"" not as Paddington. There should be more Brown families in the world. I was expecting another dumb movie for kids. To my delight, Paddington is a a tender fun-filled magical film that made me feel a kid again.",Paddington
84,cardsrock,Simply delightful,8,2 September 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. There's a wonderful sense of fun and adventure in this movie. Wes Anderson style whimsy is on full display and makes it a joy to watch. Paddington is so charming and endearing, and the supporting characters are all rather good as well. The plot detours into formulaic territory near the end, but the film as a whole makes up for it with originality in many other areas.",Paddington
85,cliftonofun,Enchanting and delightful,7,26 December 2017,"Calling this film enchanting and delightful barely covers it. From the cast to the writing to the cinematography to the music, it just plain nailed family storytelling. At a certain point, I started wondering if Wes Anderson was a consultant: every detail was perfectly placed. Like I said, enchanting and delightful.",Paddington
86,billygoat1071,Adorably Playful,8,11 February 2015,"Paddington is the kind of family movie that used to be more popular few decades ago. I mean there are more movies like this today, but they often get even lazier by relying too much on the cuteness of the talking animals and having uninspired humor and forced pop culture references (e.g. Alvin and the Chipmunks movies.) Paddington is refreshing for just being loyal to its own magic. It fully embraces its weird but quirky personality, and yet provides the right amount of heart in the end. It's nothing transcendent to the genre, but this is a better example of a movie that is best treated for the whole family.The film aims to relive the classic appeal of this type of movies. It does hold the same formula, like how the family slowly earns their love to the friendly creature they discovered, and the plot involves a lot of crazy antics, plus the villain is terribly campy who apparently belongs in a cartoon. But the movie never underestimates itself into a mediocre fare and instead finds creative ways to move through its story. It takes place in a delightful world that perfectly fits in their constant absurdity. It shows a lot of imaginative visuals and comically thrilling set pieces. But this frantic lightheartedness doesn't betray its center. Paddington doesn't get the warm welcome he expected in his first visit in London, until the people around him learn what kind of a bear he truly is. It gets a little predictable, but that clear message of acceptance is delivered with sincerity, even from the very start, which makes it quite nice anyway.The local Philippine version has Xian Lim voicing Paddington Bear instead of Ben Whishaw. The vocal performance is okay, though it sometimes feels a little less heartfelt in his line deliveries. It's much more intriguing to know what kind of warmth Whishaw provided in the original version. The actors on screen brought plenty of charm in its playfulness: even with the earnestness that defines the strict father, Hugh Bonneville is committed to be silly in some of the character's comedic scenes. And Nicole Kidman is appropriately over-the-top as the main villain.People might think that Paddington is kind of dated, at glance, but the filmmakers have real love to the material and this genre, thus make it work in this context. Even with its childish cartoon-like madness, it never tones itself down, and instead makes something truly fun out of those silliness. Again, it never really break any grounds, but it's such a heartwarming little film, giving you a real reason why you should love this character, other than just being another cute talking animal.",Paddington
87,DareDevilKid,"Witty, Clever, Hilarious – Supreme Fun for All Ages",9,25 January 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 stars""Fun for the whole family"" is an overused cliché when it comes to movies. But in the case of ""Paddington"" – the first-ever feature length film about the iconic Peruvian bear who travels to London looking for a home, there is no better description. This big-screen adaptation of Michael Bond's classic, adorable children's book character – an exceedingly polite, somewhat clumsy, immensely benevolent, surprisingly perceptive, and quite clever talking bear from ""darkest Peru"" – takes what could have been an easy cash-grab, and turns it into a generous, fun, ingenious little comedy.I was never well-versed with the Paddington books, and hence, went into ""Paddington"" without much of a clue about the beloved bear's stories and misadventures. It did not matter, though, since I ended up having a ball. The outline of the film appears to stick to Bond's original setup – funny and emotional in equal measure. When Paddington loses his Uncle Pastuzo (Michael Gambon) during an earthquake, Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) announces that she is moving to Lima – a Home for Retired Bears. The bears' encounter with the great explorer Montgomery Clyde (Tim Downie), years ago, reminds them that, in London, a young bear will be taken care of. Clyde had traveled to the deepest, darkest corner of Peru and had discovered their unique species – bears that can talk! Now, years later, with the rainforest is dwindling fast, one young bear (before he could be christened Paddington) – with the blessing of his Aunt – heads off to London armed with his characteristic floppy hat, a suitcase filled with jars of marmalade (Peruvian bears simply love orange marmalade), and a tag that says ""Please look after this bear. Thank you."" The youngster stows away in a lifeboat on a ship destined for London. He survives the journey well enough but when he ends up at London's Paddington station, no one cares for him. The city is a cold, harsh place for the bear. Enter: the Brown family.Suspicious and overly protective Brown-family patriarch, Henry (Hugh Bonneville), wants nothing to do with the scruffy bear. Henry Brown implores his wife and children to ignore the bear at all costs, but kind-hearted mom, Mary, has other ideas. She convinces Mr. Brown to feed the poor bear in a station cafe, where she dubs him ""Paddington"" after the train stop. With his irresistible looks and proper British accent – no one, of course, bats an eyelash that this creature speaks perfect English – Mrs. Brown, getting her way like most married women, further convinces Mr. Brown to take Paddington in for just one night until they can find him a proper home. The accident prone bruin will wreak havoc on the Brown household but will also have a cathartic effect on dour Henry and the Brown kids, Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) and Judy (Madeleine Harris).What ensues is a roller-coaster ride of hilarious Paddington hi- jinks and mishaps. Just when it looks like the Browns and Paddington could live happily ever after, enter the wicked Millicent (Kidman) – a museum taxidermist with an ulterior motive – who goes after Paddington with the intent of stuffing him for London's Natural History Museum.""Paddington"" is rich with past Oscar winners Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent (guest appearance), and Peter Capaldi, as well as erstwhile Oscar nominees Sally Hawkins and Julie Walters. The wonderful Hugh Bonneville (Robert, Earl of Grantham on ""Downton Abbey"") and Ben Whishaw (fantastic as the voice of Paddington), round out the ensemble. As expected, the ace (almost entirely British) cast sells the material with warmth and wit. The real key, however, is Ben Wishaw (Skyfall), who hits just the right note of innocence as Paddington. This is voice-work at its most effective, in that the actor creates a whole emotional range for the character, independent of the outstanding animation. The Browns fall in love with Paddington, and so do we.The creation of Paddington is all CGI, of course, but the massive visual effects and animation crews seamlessly integrate him into the live action with the rest of the cast. It's a truly marvelous production under Framestone, the British company responsible for the effects in ""Gravity"".""Paddington"" also has two things I normally dislike in family movies: ""rude humor"" (as the MPAA calls it) and plots that put the main character(s) in some kind of life-threatening peril. Nonetheless, both work here because writer/director Paul King doesn't use them out of desperation or lack of inspiration. Instead, he uses them to tell a story about the importance of belonging to a family. Paddington is a benevolent, loving creature who tries so hard to fit in with the Browns, only to discover that it's harder than it looks. He exasperates them at first with his destructive antics, yet over time they come to recognize him for who he is inside. Once they do, the family becomes extremely protective when he finds himself in danger. He is, after all, one of them now. This approach makes the silly scenes surprisingly hilarious, and the adventure subplot more meaningful than you would expect.Much of the joy of ""Paddington"" is seen in the terrific little touches throughout the film. Whether it's the painted leaves on the wall of the Brown home flying off as Paddington leaves, or the bear all fluffed up from a hair dryer after his bath, or when he dunks his head in a toilet bowl after drinking a whole bottle of mouthwash – it's all hugely entertaining and immensely touching at the same time.Everything about this movie is fun and entertaining. It's the kind of family film that shows everyone a good time, regardless of age. ""Paddington's"" a charming, uproarious, and totally delightful time at the movies – destined to be a classic. You could even say ""it's fun for the whole family"". Here's hoping for more Paddington adventures down the line.",Paddington

89,TheSquiss,"Funny, clever & slightly naughty adaptation of Bond's beloved bear.",8,8 December 2014,"It could have gone terribly wrong for Paddington, Paul King's live-action and CGI interpretation of the much-loved Michael Bond books, and the departure of Colin Firth with the subsequent casting of Ben Whishaw as the marmalade loving bear only added to the concern.However, though, in the early scenes, I could easily imagine Colin Firth's voice, Ben Whishaw is perfectly cast and Paddington is so enthralling as to quickly banish any thoughts beyond the adventure and mayhem that unfolds upon the screen.When an earthquake ends the idyllic life of Paddington and his aunt and uncle in darkest Peru, he stows away on a ship in search of the English explorer who introduced the bears to marmalade and departed assuring them of a warm welcome should they ever visit London. Finding the bear stranded at Paddington railway station, alone and ignored, Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) takes pity on him and offers Paddington a bed for the night and help in finding him a 'proper' home in the morning. Appalled by his wife's softness, Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) reluctantly accepts the bear for one night only but doesn't consider the effect of Paddington's charm, the impact of his presence nor the existence of Millicent (Nicole Kidman), a taxidermist at the Natural History Museum who needs a certain bear for her collection.At the heart of Paddington is a vocal performance from Whishaw that, whilst it doesn't banish the fond memory of Michael Horden's TV series narration, certainly adds a wonderful, modern and energetic slant to perhaps the most loved bear of literature after Winnie the Pooh. Paddington's 95 minutes rattle along with a gentle energy that shuns the frenetic style so common in modern children's television and instead enhances the casual calamity that Paddington leaves in his wake.Principally, King has written and directed a thoroughly entertaining caper that serves up a delicious villainess whose costumes will have some of the older audience members stirring and whose antics and snarls will have the youngsters hissing joyfully. Like the adult-pleasing cameos from Peter Capaldi, Alice Lowe, Julie Walters, Matt Lucas and Jim Broadbent, Kidman delivers a performance the children will relish in a straightforward, obvious manner while the adults will laugh at the humour of the dialogue and visual gags that fly by just over their heads.Paddington is packed with plenty of subtle humour for those who pay attention: the frequent signs and posters on the periphery of the screen, the film references and genuinely funny nods to Indiana Jones and Mission Impossible etc. But though these touches keep the adult audiences involved in the film, they are never dwelt upon, forced or allowed to detract from the simple humour and adventure that Paddington is crafted around.To be truly successful, children's stories and films have to entertain children and adults equally. It was an achievement Michael Bond delivered beautifully with his original stories and Paul King matches him admirably. In a Christmas battle that will include Minions and Madagascan penguins, a bear from darkest Peru is leading the pack triumphantly and, having taken one niece to see Paddington, I suspect I shall be cajoled into taking her three siblings. Rare as it is with 'family' films, on this occasion it will be an absolute pleasure.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Paddington
90,RevRonster,Very charming and a lot of fun!,8,3 August 2015,"This movie could have easily been just a quick and cheap adaptation of Paddington; created with no other reason in mind than to try and make some quick cash of the loyal fans of this iconic character. Shockingly, the film was anything but and was clearly made with care and it culminated in a product that is charming and very endearing.The cast is awesome and filled with talented people. Ben Whishaw does a great job of voicing Paddington and the CG used to create the bear is simply fantastic. The humor wasn't enough to make my ribs hurt as the gags are very innocent and kid-friendly (not that there's anything wrong with that) but they were still amusing (especially the scene with Henry Brown dressing as a cleaning lady).

91,andrewroy-04316,"While not particularly inventive or original, Paddington is warm-hearted, funny, and well directed",6,3 September 2018,"While it falls for the same problems of simplicity and cliche that plague many family movies, Paddington has better technical aspects than almost any and is quick, easy fun. The plot was standard fare, and the characters similarly one-dimensional for the most part. Paddington was a better protagonist though, and the movie is at its best when hilariously showing Paddington trying to understand how to live in London and in a home. I don't quite know how nobody found it strange that the talking bear was walking around London, and as always things work out pretty easily and conveniently, no matter how serious the trouble seems. The film does hint at a valuable point of what a home is, but beyond that there isn't anything unique thematically. I would still say that overall, Paddington is one of the best family movies to watch because of the technical aspects. The way the film is edited (its use of music, the scene showing the orphanage, the escalator scene was especially great) was impressive, the performances were good, and the script was good. Very enjoyable and pleasant to watch.",Paddington

From the cast, the script, the animation and everyone else involved with this project - this film (and the sequel to it) come together to create a flawless story for all ages.Both this and the sequel are closely related and both must have been made either at the same time or with each other in mind.Like Disney's 'Peter Pan', the story is mostly about the kids and the titular character... and both give a generous portion of the narrative to the characters of the parents. There are other parallels, too.The voice of Ben Whishaw as Paddington is perfect and it's eerily similar to the sound of a softer Terence Stamp. At times you'd swear these two must have been born in the same room!Hugh Bonneville is sublime as the harried father who takes parenthood very seriously, although not always in a direction his wife and kids approve of. (Lots of teens will relate to that!)Sally Hawkins is simply brilliant as the wife who hasn't quite left her decadent '60s' years behind her... and who delivers the shortest lines ('Oooh, laminated!' & 'Crikey!') with phenomenal execution.Lots of slapstick for the kids and plenty of Easter eggs for the bigger kids, too.If you're a fan of the 'Richard Curtis' school of pathos, comedy, and storytelling, you'll love this.",Paddington

It did a decent job of bringing the essence of the animated series to a live-Action feature film. Paddington's origins consist of him being a rare Peruvian bear who after a force of nature destroyed his home, caused him to travel to London and seek refuge with an explorer who visited his family long ago, but instead he ends up being the unwanted house guest of the Brown family, who named him after the train station they found him at.Paddington Bear is very delightful. Beautifully humorous in his curiosity of the human world. I was afraid that the excellent trailer for this movie was showcasing the only two good bits in the film, but luckily that was not the case at all. The film was filled with wonderful bits as charmingly funny as the ones used for advertising. Definitely a great time at the movies. Recommend.",Paddington
94,MattBrady099,A good family movie for the kids and adults,7,8 December 2014,"Do you just hate it when a trailer or a movie poster can false advertise a movie like: Edge of tomorrow, Dredd 3-D, Warm Bodies and now this movie.The story to Paddington is about a Peruvian bear who loves all things British, travels to London only to find himself overwhelmed at Paddington station. Lucky for him, the Brown family discovers him and offers a temporary haven. But he also catches the eye of a museum taxidermist, who is determined to add the rare bear to his collection.The first teaser trailer for this movie was in my opinion god-awful, you know when he's in the bathroom and he puts the two tooth brushes in his ears and gives it a little bit of a twist and turn, then he pulls it out and you can clearly see a giant peace of ear wax and then he licks it; that right they is just stupid kids humor and I wasn't looking forward to film at all. But when I look at some of the reviews for the film it actually got good feed back from critics. Empire give the film a five out of five star's and IGN give the film a 7.9/10, I couldn't believe it, I had to check twice to make sure that what I'm seeing is true, but I still wasn't hooked until I got a chance to see the film and to my surprise the movie isn't as bad as I thought it was and I actually found the movie to be funny. Ben Whishaw did the voice for the marmalade loving bear himself Paddington, and Ben Whishaw did a outstanding job of playing Paddington. He had that voice of a young, friendly and kind person (or bear if you must). Now originally Colin Firth was suppose to play this role but at the last minute he turned the role down by saying, ""The voice didn't match the character "", and to be honest I think he did the right thing, because I don't Firth's voice will match the character at all he just sound like Colin Firth.The movie has beautiful cinematography with some breathtaking shots of London, and the film had the Christmas feeling to it and it actually got the tone right.Now the visual effect's for the bear I have to be honest was the most realistic thing I've seen since this years movie Dawn Of the planet of the Apes. His fur looks like real fur that I can just go up to the screen a feel it, then I get kicked out the cinema for being a weirdo, but as I said realistic.If I had to pick a thing that I didn't like about the film I would say the character's and some of the jokes sometimes hit and sometimes miss. The character's in the movie are not all that interesting and they pretty dull to watch, Paddington, Nicole Kidman and Peter Capaldi are the only character's that I actually liked, and yes even the villain I enjoyed watching more then the family. Some of the jokes at times mash really well and didn't but when I think that's a small complain.Overall Paddinton was the biggest surprise of the year for me with it's cute bear, nice story and overall a good family film.",Paddington
95,willcundallreview,A likable film but can feel generic,6,19 November 2015,"Paddington, a small little Peruvian bear with a big heart and an extremely fuzzy face. Paddington the movie is the big screen film all about well Paddington the bear whose quest to live in London is both heart warming and pretty funny, I do though find some parts of this not that great. Featuring a cast with the likes of Hugh Bonneville, Nicole Kidman and Julie Walters the film you would think and many do that this is a great old romp and one for the ages, for all ages yes very true but I did feel this a little basic, don't get me wrong it is perfectly OK and I would recommend it but I still expected more from a movie with such high praise.Basically Paddington is a bear going to seek a home in London because his auntie told him to; we then follow him as he becomes a stowaway on a long trip to stereotypically rainy London where he comes across a family of various personalities. Hugh Bonneville's character Henry Brown is the dad and is very stuck up, works in risk assessment and his work follows him everywhere he goes. The mum Mary (Sally Hawkins) is really quite free and not like her husband at all for that matter, she is really the one who welcomes Paddington with open arms. We then have the children Judy and Jonathan with Judy being a teenager completely embarrassed by her family and not exactly happy by the furry arrival.Paul King directs and brings a very fast tone, the movie speeds along like a bullet and every scene seems to suddenly become an adventure in itself. I think a lot of the things I did like about this come from the writing also from King, it is funny and every joke is set up in a way that not only the kids will laugh at. On that previous point I think one massive part of the appeal of this movie is the point that this is for adults too and charming and humorous enough to be enjoyed truly by all the family. Like I said at the beginning this movie does feel pretty basic, I mean the story plays out pretty normally, the main characters all go in the exact direction you'd predict, but I think what made people like this was the heart to it. This is one movie where I think the trailer truly made peoples expectations a lot lower so when they came round to watching it they found it a pleasant surprise. Now don't get me wrong it is fun all the way through but still I feel this nowhere near as excellent as some proclaim, but take nothing away from it, this is still a satisfactory experience.Overall Paddington is a movie I would say go and watch, and if you have kids then even more so because not only you might enjoy it but the young one's will too. I also want to add some more on the acting, basically from a concluding point Peter Capaldi is the best of the cast in his role as the always complaining Mr Curry, Nicole Kidman is not good in her role as Millicent the museum taxidermist, she felt too dull in her role and very atypical of the kind of character she is playing, I'm not saying she is completely to blame, the character is just not a good one.",Paddington
96,david-meldrum,"Beautiful, funny and spot-on",9,29 January 2015,"It's taken me far too long to get round to reviewing this since I saw it so my reflections on it are limited ... so suffice to say it's magnificent. Like all of us who grew up on Paddington there was nervousness at a precious childhood memory being revisited; I needn't have worried. It's a loving, committed, beautifully produced all-age film. I say all-age advisedly; this is not a children't film. A children's film will only be enjoyed by children. Paddington will be richly enjoyed by anyone with a heart, a soul and a sense of humour. We laughed a lot throughout the film; and the film's message of welcoming the different and challenging 'other' person into your heart and home community is unmistakably presented without ever ramming it down the throat. The performances are whole-hearted and engaging; the bear himself us hypnotically funny and perfectly presented. Just see it and love it.",Paddington

98,shawneofthedead,A bear necessity.,8,7 December 2014,"There's plenty to be cynical about where Paddington is concerned. The first feature film about the iconic bear - red hat, blue coat, suitcase in hand - was first announced in 2007, and went through a gestation period that's extraordinarily long even for a heavily animated film. The trailer's (literal) toilet humour seemed to confirm that it was pitched firmly at kids. And last, but certainly not least, the cast experienced a shake-up of fairly seismic proportions when Colin Firth announced in July that - with the unanimous consent of all concerned - he would no longer be voicing Paddington. All signs pointed towards a disaster of a movie, one stitched together to cash in on rather than celebrate the phenomenon of Paddington, a little bear who has lived in books, TV series and cuddly merchandise around the world.It's a flat-out joy to discover, then, that Paddington is very far from a disaster. Indeed, it's an unmitigated delight of a family film. Of course, ""family films"" don't really cater to everyone in the family a lot of the time - the phrase is a euphemism applied to movies that adults must put up with or suffer through for the sake of entertaining their children. But Paul King's Paddington, based on the beloved books by Michael Bond, really does have something for everyone and is, incidentally, an utterly lovely movie about families to boot. The young will be bowled over by the adorable bear who tumbles through London and into the hearts of his adopted family. The young at heart -and even a few older, crankier people - will find much to enjoy in the film's cheerfully subversive script.Our journey begins in Darkest Peru, where a young bear (voiced with pitch-perfect charm by Whishaw) lives happily with his Aunt Lucy (Staunton) and Uncle Pastuzo (Gambon). He inherits from them a healthy love for marmalade and London, as well as a floppy, red felt hat left behind decades ago by English explorer Montgomery Clyde (Downie). When an earthquake destroys their idyllic home, Aunt Lucy urges her nephew to strike out to London. Many jars of marmalade later, he finds himself in the iconic train station that gives him his name. He meets the Brown family: risk- averse Henry (Bonneville), dreamy Mary (Hawkins) and their children, Judy (Harris) and Jonathan (Joslin). With Henry insisting that Paddington can only stay while he looks for a more permanent home, the bear begins investigations in London - unaware that Millicent, an obsessive, possibly crazy taxidermist (Kidman), has very specific reasons for wanting him to visit her museum.Strictly speaking, there isn't anything all that new or original about Paddington. We've seen the trope many times before - in trying to find a new home, a misfit changes the hearts and minds of the people who will eventually become his family. The narrative of the film is also little more than a patchwork of wacky incidents and hijinks: Paddington floods the bathroom while trying to come to terms with the ""facilities""; Paddington apprehends a criminal through sheer good luck and his incredibly honest nature; Paddington and Henry infiltrate the top-secret Geographers' Guild to hunt down Mr. Clyde.And yet, King has crafted something quite charming and magical around the bare bones of his story. The film practically radiates love for the sweet-tempered, unfailingly polite bear at its heart. A life-long fan of the ursine hero, King peppers his script with smart references to Bond's books, from Paddington's trademark 'hard stare', used to embarrass people into behaving better, through to the meddling interference of nosy, thrifty neighbour Mr. Curry (Capaldi). He's also updated and deepened the story to give the elder Browns their own emotional arc: Mary's determination to open her heart and home to a stranger is what eventually leads Henry to getting back in touch with his wilder, more fun-loving side. The film also looks quite spectacular, whether Paddington is surfing down a flight of stairs in a bathtub or we're allowed a dollhouse glimpse at the Brown family as they go about their lives.Most importantly, King infuses the entire film with a practically joyous strain of comedy and wit. Pratfalls and sight gags are accompanied by deliciously silly allusions to William Shakespeare and Mission Impossible. Even the film's supporting characters get their own hefty share of comedy, whether it's housekeeper Mrs Bird (Walters) distracting a security guard by means of a booze throwdown or Mr. Curry falling instantly for Millicent to a smooth burst of Lionel Richie. Millicent herself is an inspired creation. Prowling through the film, togged out in figure-hugging snakeskin and wielding scalpels, she brings to mind and subverts the icy-cool blonde archetype most beloved of Alfred Hitchcock.The sharp script and stunning visuals would mean little without a cast wholly committed to their roles, and King has struck gold with his offbeat casting choices. Bonneville, a veteran of Downton Abbey, has no problem playing Henry's constant anxiety over his children, but also gleefully flings propriety to the winds as he slips into tunic and apron for a spot of howlingly funny undercover business. Hawkins lends Mary - the loving, tender heart of the household and Paddington's biggest champion - a soulful gravitas. Great as they are, however, the MVP here is Kidman. Her fantastically manic performance as Millicent reminds us why it's a damn shame that she hasn't been in a comedy for years - she's so cheerfully unhinged in the film that she steals pretty much every scene she's in.It doesn't matter whether you're a fan of Bond's books, someone who only knows Paddington as a cuddly soft toy, or a neophyte who has never heard of this walking, talking, marmalade-loving bear. Paddington is a big, warm bear hug of a film, one that will enchant children and tickle adults, even as it grabs just about everyone by the heart with its charm and humour.",Paddington
99,jawneyfloros,the story of paddington bear,1,20 November 2018,Review: I found this to be an interesting concept in the sense that do we really need to make a movie about a famous British teddy bear. The direction and screenplay aren't bad. The casting and acting aren't that great either. All in all I would give this a star out of a possible five stars.,Paddington
100,gary-444,A Timeless Masterpiece,9,1 January 2015,"This is an instant classic. The raw materials, a heart-warming, but lightweight children's story are not the obvious stuff of a great film,the hybrid real life and cgi high risk. But it works, spectacularly. Translated into over thirty languages, and comprising over twenty books, the simple adventures of an anthropomorphised bear from darkest Peru have enchanted parents and children alike. Hamish McColl has done a fabulous job with the screenplay creating a story inspired by events in the books, but not telling a particular previous story.The ingredients are carefully crafted. Casting is almost perfect. Hugh Bonneville is an arch paternal figure, a role popularised with his stint at Downton Abbey, a series which has enjoyed great success in the United States, broadening the film's transatlantic appeal. Nicole Kidman is wonderful in her baddie, Cruella de Ville incarnation as Millicent. All dads will love the lingering shots of her from the soles of her vertiginous heels upwards. She flounces and pounces and generally has the most fun, particularly when enhanced by her no-hoper admirer Mr Curry (Peter Capaldi). The kids, play cameo roles well, housekeeper Julie Walters is a dotty delight with prodigious drinking game skills. The only character I didn't quite buy was Sally Hawkins as the wife. Very Boho and Notting Hill, she didn't quite convince opposite Hugh Bonneville as his wife.At the eleventh hour crisis struck the production when Colin Firth left the production as the voice of Paddington. But sweet are the uses of adversity, and Ben Wishaw stepped in to capture the spirit and essence of the bear perfectly.Director Paul King creates a wonderfully British landscape without wallowing in nostalgia too much. Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, the Natural History Museum, Red telephone boxes, double decker buses and English Bobbies are of course on show, but multi -cultural bustling London is also there, saving it from a sickly sweet end.Not only is the story well told, but the dialogue is crisp, funny and fresh too. The linguist daughter learns how to say ""I have been accused of insider trading and require legal representation"" in Chinese, and when Paddington is tied up in a chase wearing a policeman's helmet the local bobbies come to his aid with an ""officer in distress"" call.King has some fun with nods to other movies too. The scene where the cabbies code becomes ""guidelines"" under Inquisitor Nicole Kidman echoes Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, Paddington has to rescue his hat from a descending shutter blind as Indiana Jones did, and Kidman descends from a skylight in an attempt to capture Paddington as Tom Cruise did in Mission Impossible, with a further scene reprised as Paddington makes his escape up a metal vent shaft.Ninety minutes is about right for a family film and at 95 minutes, not a second is wasted, nor dramatic lull endured. Hugh Bonneville's scene in drag is more Les Dawson than Mrs Doubtfire and works in a surreal way, Matt Lucas gets his comeuppance as an awkward cab driver in a way that British MP David Mellor would surely approve of. Some homespun philosophy about outsiders, family, and love, stay just the right side of schmaltz neatly reinforcing the story's wholesome credentials. The special effects are fabulous, particularly a flood, and the essentials, a hat, duffle coat and marmalade are all present and correct.A certainty to be around for many Christmases, and years, to come.",Paddington
101,Figgy66-915-598470,A Great Family Film,9,9 December 2014,"9 December 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Paddingon. I've been looking forward to this film for months and it didn't disappoint. Just in case there is the remotest chance that nobody knows......Paddington is the tale of a bear from deepest darkest Peru who comes to London and takes up residence with the Brown Family. There are all the recognisable elements from the children's programme, from the blue duffel coat down to the marmalade sandwich kept in Paddington's hat for emergencies. The baddie was played exquisitely by Nicole Kidman, a job she seems to relish. Mr Brown was excellently played by Hugh Bonneville, who seemed to carry a tiny but welcome piece of Lord Grantham into the character. The addition of Julie Walters as Mrs Bird was inspiring as she manages to bring her usual brilliance to the old housekeeper who had been with the family for years. The animation was extraordinary and had the whole audience laughing out loud. There was an audible gasp at one point when Paddington was in peril, and viewers young and old all sat up in their seats hoping against hope that our hero would survive. I went with a group of people of which I was definitely the youngest, the oldest being 78. This is definitely a film for the whole family.",Paddington
102,kermitkid,Didn't know a kids' film could be this good!,10,30 March 2020,"I didn't expect this to be as good as it was, because, come on, it's Paddington. But, surprisingly, I really enjoyed this film. The CGI for the bears is incredible, and the way the fur moves so realistically is amazing. Although, for a kids' film, it's surprisingly dark. A taxidermist wanting to kill Paddington?! What were they thinking?! You don't have Tigger trying to eat Winnie-the-Pooh. The addition of a villain felt unneccessary, although Nicole Kidman's performance was pretty great. I was pleasantly surprised by Peter Capaldi's character. There's actually some inside jokes if you're a Doctor Who fan, at his expense. This isn't just some kids film. I really enjoyed it, more than I thought I would. Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Most likely not, but it is a fun film. The writing was great, the acting was great, the CGI was great. Everything about this film was great. I highly recommend it. Contrary to what I thought at first, it's not completely un-bear-able. The fact that it has 98% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes says a lot, especially considering the type of film it is.

At first the family is unsure about padding ton and how he fits into the family and what people,e will think of them.

104,ayoreinf,"Now, that's what true to the spirit is all about.",8,13 April 2015,"As it has been mentioned by other reviewers, this movie doesn't follow any specific plot line from the original books. Yet almost none seems to mind, since what we get here feels exactly like any adventure Paddington has gotten himself into, in the original book series.But while the original series took place in the 50s and the 60s, and the film, not being a period piece, takes place in present day London. Still the film captures the exact nature of the books, gently mocking some British ideas and concepts, using physical humor but never making it coarse, not even when Mr. Brown is in drag. And all together reaching a very intelligent bottom line. It's a very fine balance not easily achieved, and this film does get it right. The actors all give their share some are more outstanding than others, especially so Nicole Kidman, having the time of her life as a real cartoon baddie. It's not her first time as the villain, but this specific villain seems to be one she really enjoyed playing. I've often said when everybody in the production is having fun, and still maintains due professionalism, all we viewers are left with, is joining the party.",Paddington

106,squirrel_burst,"A real treat, I had a terrific time with ""Paddington""",8,19 February 2015,"Movies like ""Paddington"" are a perfect example of why when I want to laugh, I don't usually go looking for the latest R-Rated sex comedy, I seek well written, carefully put together children's movies. It's funny, playful, very charming, cute and it warmed my heart. I had a great time with it and I hope it reaches as many people as it deserves to. Paddington (the voice of Ben Whishaw) is a rare specimen of marmalade-loving, English-speaking, intelligent bears from Darkest Peru. When he travels to London, he has trouble finding a home and is taken in by the Browns (much to Mr. Brown's chagrin). Searching for a home, he is unaware that a taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) is after his hide.I have to admit that I was a little wary about this movie when I saw the first trailers. I saw what I thought were the same kind of shenanigans that I see in so many bad children's properties made into live-action movies. I was absolutely delighted to see that in context, not only were those clips much funnier, but they were inserted in an intelligently-written story. The film is very sweet, and totally harmless but throws in some well-placed humor to ensure that you won't fall in love with it simply because you want to bring Paddington home and brush his fur all day. I would say that most of the comedy comes in the form of either Paddington misunderstanding our complex world (he does come from a jungle you know) or simply being a bear in our world.I know what you're thinking, but let me assure you that these jokes are done the right way. There is nothing that will date this movie like Paddington listening to a Justin Bieber song and being scared, or him watching reality TV and being surprised that such tiny people can live in the Brown's house. I thought the running gags were very well handled and often inserted in the story as real plot points, which impressed me a lot. I was also happy to see that there's a nice variety of humor. It's got physical comedy and pratfalls, fish-out-of-water confusion, puns, odd-couple type comedy and more. It's even got a couple of jokes thrown in there clearly for adults, but they're not bad sex jokes that will go over your kids' heads, they're just funny references that will make you say ""hey wait a second, did that voice on the tape that girl was listening to just say...."" and then it will move on to the next joke. You would have to be the bitterest, Ebenezer Scrooge clone not to laugh hard at least 5 or 6 times during the film.A technical element that really impressed me was how good the movie looked. This movie made me realize that there's something about bears that I really like. They're kind of like big lumpy cats with short tails that can stand up on their hind legs, and Paddington is by far the most adorable one I've seen in a long time. It's clear that this marmalade-lover is a computer-generated creation, but it really does look fantastic, like you could be fooled into thinking that they actually did train a small Peruvian bear to walk around on set... if it wasn't for the red hat and the fact that he talks. I really was blown away by how convincing he was.2015 is going to be filled with all kinds of big special effects movies that I'm sure a lot of children are going to go see. Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing parents who will take their kiddies to ""Jurassic World"" or ""Avengers 2"" because those are going to be great-looking movies that are probably going to be a lot of fun. If I was a kid I would think the greatest thing in the world would be seeing big budget blockbusters at the theater. What I am saying is that it's important to have a balance. Being a kid is also about being able to watch a nice quiet movie that's inoffensive, funny and very sweet and be able to enjoy it. There's something very special about a movie like ""Paddington"" because it is wittily written, earnest and charming. As an adult I would have had a great time seeing it even without my ten-year-old nephew sitting next to me. Seeing it with him though, I felt like we really had something special going on, a new warm memory to share together and a new friend in the form of this sweet bear in his red hair and blue coat. This is a film that is terribly earnest and doesn't cheapen out or compromise, and that most of all, is probably what I liked about it. Paddington and the Browns are more than enough appeal. There was no need to have anyone shout ""Say Hello to my LITTLE FRIEND!"" or inject any type of pop culture references and for this, I really feel like this is the kind of movie that will truly stand the test of time, much like the books it's based on have.Even though there were a few tiny jokes here and there that made me wince a bit, I enjoyed myself so much that I would be eager to see the movie again, or see another story with these characters. I really think this movie is special in the same way that those ""Winnie the Pooh"" movies I saw when I was younger (And that I've come to love as an adult) is special. Do not make the mistake of missing out on ""Paddington"" because this charming bear totally won me over and it's sure to melt your heart too. As I sat there in the theater laughing and smiling at this delightful little film it dawned on me that I really loved it. (Theatrical version on the big screen, February 6, 2015)",Paddington
107,dallasryan,Fun for the Whole Family,8,28 July 2015,"Paddington is a delightful film that will leave you feeling good about the world. Funny and irresistible, it touches on the core of why we love watching movies in the first place. The script is very simple and it goes by the traditional format of any family film, however there is nothing cheesy nor contrived in it's journey which seems to usually be the case with most films in this genre. This film also has many break through experimental film shots that you never see in any film. The experimental shots highly pay off in this one.

109,ultramatt2000-1,More like Paddington Turkey,1,19 May 2015,"This is not a ""Matthew Rants,"" but more of a ""Matthew Rambles."" When I first heard about it, I was excited and when I saw it, I was not happy about it. I haven't felt this upset since I re-watched the 1998 GODZILLA in 2004. My mother was a fan of it, but was not happy about the film. I was planning to see it on the big screen, but couldn't because of the Blizzard of 2015! It is a good thing we saw it On-Demand. This movie is a mess! It is a Frankenstein's Monster made up a kids-drive adults bananas movie, a live-action cartoon, a (Disney Channel) sitcom, Wes Anderson style film-making, 101 DALMATIONS, A NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL and DIE HARD just to name a few. Nicole Kidman as the villain is a clone of Cruella DeVille she like animals for her morbid purposes! I bet kids were scared by the sharp objects she used. Hugh Bonneville, who played Robert Crawley om TV's DOWNTON ABBEY, is Mr. Brown and this is the kind of movie he would get off of his resume! DR. WHO's Peter Capaldi is Mr. Curry. Look what they done to him! Before in the books and cartoon adaptations, he was a haughty and grumpy sort of fellow and boomed ""Bear!"" when Paddington messed around with his stuff. He has gone from Squidward or Mr. Wilson to a wacky neighbor of those sitcoms! The gags are clever and the audience happen to be catered for those who watch stuff on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel. PADDINGTON has dropped into the neighborhood with the live-action versions of The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat. When he is taking out the garbage, just warn him about the Milpitas Monster (read my comment). So in a nutshell: It is a complete waste of time, a complete waste of money, a complete waste of talent artistic skill an a complete waste of celluloid. Rated PG for mischief, peril, crude humor and some scary scenes.",Paddington
110,jackgdemoss,Sweet as marmalade,9,24 August 2018,"This is the best mid-budget cinematography I have seen in years. Erik Wilson truly out did himself. I found myself on at least 7 occasions, audibly marveling at a unique and brilliantly executed effect of his work. In addition, the color schemes were bright and vibrant, making characters and places stand out and be memorable. As for the story itself, it carried strong until the climax, which felt lacking. This is one small hiccup in an otherwise remarkable film. Sally Hawkins is charming as could be, only outdone by Paddington himself. This is only the second film I have seen Hawkins in, and I look forward to seeing her again. All in all, this movie is heart-warming to general audiences and awe-inspiring to movie connoisseurs.",Paddington
111,brianberta,A family film which is a great start to 2015.,6,18 February 2015,"Paddington can't be called the best family movie of 2015 since it was only January and we're barely into the year yet. However, we are definitely off to a great start. I thought this was just going to be a trashy ripoff of ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"". Luckily, this film turned out to be better then it by a lot. Sure, the script is a little over sentimental at times but for the most part, it's pretty entertaining. The movie has Nicole Kidman as the villain who is a museum taxidermist. She wants Paddington's fur and she wants to mount it on her wall. She adds enough suspense to the film to help it get away from ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" which was too cute all the time. This movie has a few problems but the good far outweighs the bad and it delivers on its promise. It's a great example of how good family films should be and hopefully more family movies will learn off this one and maybe improve off of it. It's a great start to 2015.",Paddington
112,CleveMan66,"""Paddington"" is delightful family fun",7,7 March 2015,"It takes guts to bring a much beloved children's book series to the big screen and it's tough to do it well. It's especially difficult when those books have been translated into 30 languages, each representing a different culture with its own set of expectations for any movie adaptation. Those were the challenges the filmmakers faced in making a live action version of the Paddington Bear character that Michael Bond launched in his 1958 book, but the British film ""Paddington"" (PG, 1:35) does the character proud.As in the books, Paddington is an orphaned brown bear, raised in ""deepest, darkest Peru"" by his aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo. The couple was given those names by an English explorer they encountered many years ago. He also taught them to speak English and introduced them to the deliciousness of marmalade, two things they passed down to their nephew. When a massive earthquake kills Pastuzo, Lucy decides to move into a retirement home for bears and sends her nephew to London to find the old explorer and, hopefully, a new, loving home. But the young bear doesn't exactly know how to get around in a human city, so he sits on his suitcase in a train station, wearing the floppy red hat that his uncle got from the explorer and, around his neck, a note from his aunt asking some kind Londoner to ""take care of this bear"". Apparently, in London, a bear walking around is no cause for alarm and a talking bear is only seen as slightly unusual. When the Brown family happens along, not only are they not scared, but Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) stops to talk to Paddington. Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) wants nothing to do with the bear, but his wife convinces him to give the bear a place to stay for ""just one night"". She names him after the train station where he was found, and home they go.If you're familiar with the book series, you've probably noticed that Paddington's basic background story remains intact, but the screenplay does take some liberties to make the film version more viable for the big screen. While Paddington's other well-known characteristics are here (including the blue coat, which he gets from the Browns, his customary politeness, his ""hard stare"" when he gets annoyed and, of course, his talent for getting into trouble and making a mess of things, despite his best intentions), other characters and situations have been added. As the Browns help Paddington try to find the old explorer, the little brown bear is being pursued by a woman named Millicent (Nicole Kidman). She wants to stuff Paddington, and I don't mean by giving him a pile of marmalade sandwiches. She's a taxidermist, who, for very personal reasons, would consider mounting Paddington's carcass to be her most important work. She's a younger Cruella DeVil with neater hair, and she adds an extra element of danger to the story that wasn't present in the books. But worry not, families with small children. The danger isn't portrayed in a way that would frighten the kiddos and the youngest of them wouldn't understand what's going on anyway.""Paddington"" is everything you would expect from this big screen adaptation – and more. The titular bear (as voiced by 30-something British actor Ben Whishaw) is charming and adorable and the visual effects that bring him to life are superb. Although I wasn't impressed with the kids playing the children in the Brown family, the adult cast was great. Hawkins is a recent Oscar nominee and Bonneville is a Golden Globe and Emmy nominee for his ongoing residence at ""Downton Abbey"". It was fun seeing the stoic and proper Lord Grantham, at various points in the film, sport a beard, wear a woman's house coat and scoot across a narrow window ledge. Kidman's character in the movie is very lithe too. Watching her sinister activities made me wonder if she was doing her own stunts. Either way, the adult characters' antics just added to the fun. And that's what this movie is – fun. Although it feels a tad dull at times, overall, it's a delightful film that should be enjoyed by the whole family. ""B+""",Paddington
113,blakiepeterson,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Family Movie,9,2 May 2015,"""I LIKE THE BEAR,"" a little girl exclaimed behind me during the first few minutes of Paddington. The delighted reaction took me by surprise, and then it turned into a reminder. The farther I drift away from childhood, the longer I avoid interacting with elementary-aged children, there is a tendency to forget that there is such a thing as kids movies and family movies. I saw The LEGO Movie with my dad, true, but even then, it felt like I was watching a slightly sanitized version of The Simpsons instead of a reprehensible Pixar knockoff.These days, family movies try as hard as they can to appeal to the kiddos and their parents; maybe executives know how excruciating it can be to sit through a particularly painful foray into baby-talk and recycled jokes. Though it isn't my personal favorite genre, it is undeniable that family films please more routinely than any other category in film. So much emphasis is put onto each project that it's rare to find a stinker among the handful.But most children's films are only good, entertaining for the time being but not packed with enough quality to have an impact for more than a few months. Imagine my surprise when Paddington went from 0 to 60, straight into my cynical heart. Paddington is far too marvelous to throw around the effective cliché that it has something for the kids and something for the adults; like Babe, The Muppets, and yes, even Frozen, it transcends our prejudiced assumptions and takes us inside a fairy tale where anything can happen. It doesn't matter what age we are; it is as if you could throw dust into the air, only to find it fall in a golden flurry. Paddington shouldn't work, but it does. It does so well, in fact, that I can say with full confidence that it is one of the best genre films of the decade.Paddington the Bear is already a beloved literary figure, of course, but when we first meet him in his own star vehicle, it is as though he is new again. As the film begins, we find him living in Darkest, Peru with his aunt and uncle (Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon), both of whom are marmalade obsessed and intelligent enough to speak in cultured British accents. The film explains this noteworthy phenomenon: decades earlier, an explorer arrived in Peru, and, smitten with the bears otherworldly craftiness, taught them how to act as if they were civilized human beings.After tragedy strikes, Paddington's aunt decides that it would be best if her nephew went to find a home in London. When he arrives at a train station, most disregard his exuberant politeness, but not Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins). Her family looks at him with differing levels of judgment, especially her husband (Hugh Bonneville), but the Brown's pity him, eventually deciding to take him in.Paddington may have inimitable manners, but he surely isn't gifted when it comes to gracefulness (in a hilariously mounted comedic sequence, Paddington discovers the joys of the family bathroom, only to flood the entire house). Most would give him up, but with his considerable charm to make up for his klutziness, he even wins over Mr. Brown. But just as things begin to look up into storybook heaven, Millicent Clyde (a scene- stealing Nicole Kidman) enters the scene, a blood-thirsty taxidermist who wants nothing more than to stuff Paddington for her latest exhibit.With its candy-colored imagery and bouncy humor, Paddington is impossible to resist, a feature that really and truly makes you relive the glorious innocence of childhood. Voiced by the genial Ben Whishaw, Paddington is a fluffy friend for the ages, more cuddly and comical than Despicable Me's famed Minions. The CGI used to flesh him out is so convincing that every single strand of fur sticks out with remarkable detail; there were times I forgot that Paddington is an outright miracle of animation, not a real-life talent I could meet on the red carpet. There you have it. Paddington doesn't need an analysis, nor does it need a critic to highlight how much of a wonder it is. It is an unusually magical and unusually well-crafted family movie that needs to be watched immediately. Take you mom, take your dad, take your sister, take your brother — take anybody. Because, like the little girl who sat behind me during its extraordinary 95 minutes, I like the bear.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",Paddington

115,WubsTheFadger,Paddington,8,5 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Paddington really surprised me. The story is light hearted, very funny, and has some great lessens for children. The characters are all great and funny in their own way and the dialogue between the characters is good. The ending is heartwarming and hilarious.The acting is very good. Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, Nicole Kidman, and Tim Downie all perform well. Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon do some great voice over work. Ben Whishaw delivers the best performance as Paddington. His voice is so sweet and calming which gives his character a light and kindhearted feeling. The pacing is good but slows down towards the middle. The runtime is very short. The CGI is a little dated though.Pros: Light hearted and funny story, great acting, amazing voice acting by Ben Whishaw, Paddington as a character, a short runtime, and a great endingCons: Some slow pacing in the middle of the film and some outdated CGI
Overall Rating: 8.0P.S. I can't wait to see Paddington 2 after watching this film. Ms. Bird is hilarious and I hope she is in the second film.",Paddington
116,stephendaxter,"A fun, fast paced children's film that the whole family can enjoy",7,15 February 2015,"I enjoyed this film a lot more than i initially thought i would, at first i expected the film to be one that only young children would enjoy, but this film really did have something in it for everyone. This very family-friendly film is centered around an adventure of Paddington, the beloved children's toy that has spanned many generations. This film was very entertaining, for the most part of the film i was very entertained, the main plot was basic enough for children to understand but interesting enough so that anyone older could still have a good time. A main factor in having a good time during this film were the jokes, there were many jokes, a few didn't quite have the effect they were supposed to but for the most part they were pretty funny for some family-friendly humour. The only issue i had with the jokes is that they could have been a little more spread out, i felt that the bulk of the funny moments were during the middle portion of the film and the beginning and ending didn't really have a whole lot, as those sections were more plot focused. A more even spread of funny moments would have made for even more enjoyment over the course of the whole movie, that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it but it could have been better. As for the performances, all of the cast did a good job, no-one really stood out as being fantastic but for the most part they were all solid performances, even the voice actor for Paddington was good. This movie is a fun time for the whole family that all can enjoy and moves at a quick enough pace so you don't lose interest - 7.6",Paddington

If you don't know who that is, it is about a talking bear who has to leave his home and move to England, to be taken in by a family, where antics ensue! -I was going to cut it some slack because it is a film aimed towards family audiences, but it was honestly pretty good.-The story is heartwarming, but it has some trouble, as most films like this do, focusing evenly on the bear/family dynamic and the villain and her plot line.-The pace was good. Average but engaging.-The acting is good, nothing special. Whoever played the bear did well. The family is good. The dad, or discount Collin Firth, I though was probably the best. And Amy Adams as the badly-wigged villain was good.-The characters are fun and cheesy. Yup.-The music was fun and fitting, but forgettable.-Another thing I liked was the film's humor. All the funny moments in the trailer were even more funny and heartwarming in the film! -So Paddington is a fun, heartwarming family film that does not deviate from and form of cliché, but is honestly pretty good. If you are looking for a family movie to see, Paddington is worth seeing in theaters!",Paddington
119,palavitsinis,"Warm, family, touching",7,16 April 2015,"Well, when you sign up for a movie with a bear, you usually know what you expect to see. It was all that and even more. We did not see it with kids or for them, but it is a movie that will be enjoyed more by people less than 10-12 years of age. Apart from that, it was nicely done with nice scenery and nice photography altogether. Acting was really really decent from the entire crew and the addition of Nicole Kidman really helped the movie a lot. Although we did not expect it, although we knew that the bear was ""fake"", we laughed a lot and it also reminded us of expressions that our dogs do. I think it was kind of purposeful from the movie- makers, which was brilliant thinking actually. If you want to spend a couple of relaxed hours watching a family movie that will bring some laughs along the way, Paddington is the choice you should make.",Paddington
120,paul_3-960-896774,Endearing and worth the watch,7,16 February 2015,"Some movies are easy to talk about but Paddington is not one of them. There's not much to say about this movie. As surprising as this may sound the Michael Bond books adaptation is a hard one to grasp. I want to say what my experience of the movie was like but it's hard for me to do so but I'll try.I am probably not the target audience for Paddington but the three foot six bear has something extremely appealing about him. Paddington is charming, respectful and funny. I couldn't help but have a smile on my face when he was on screen. The little C.G.I Bear is so lovable that he feels very much alive. Thanks to the seamless special effects, the good live acting from the cast, and the great job Ben Whishaw did voice acting that character - as if I needed another reason to admire this actor.The movie is endearing and warms your heart, it has this classical witty British humor that adults will responds to and children will enjoy. It's also a smart movie with a positive message, acceptance. Watching Paddington feels very much like reading book, I mean each sequences has a beginning and an end, it feels a like turning the page of a book each page a little more amazing than the next. Paddington will surprise you and put a smile on your face, it embodies the family film genre very well. I would love you hear your thoughts on this, if you can, so tweet me @wornoutspines",Paddington

122,selffamily,Totally disappointing,2,20 April 2015,"My children had the chance to read the Paddington books, as did I. They were harmless, funny and engaging, and I remember being amazed at how funny they were, as a child, and that books could be funny. But this is not Paddington. To start with, what's all that rubbish about the explorer? It's for very young children, who can suspend belief and relax into a story - they don't need explanations as to how and why. Then the house (someone else has mentioned it) is not a normal middle of the road house, the humour changes and becomes over the top slapstick stuff with the bathroom scene. And a menacing taxidermist? What's that about? This is a story/set of stories for very young children who don't need to have the Bekesy's scared out them. Why not let kids just be kids and not have scary stuff forced at them? We have a couple of generations of screwed up kids, why make it worse? An innocent lovely work of children's literature has been adulterated and I shall spend months trying to get the rubbish out of my head. If it's not a crime, it's a sin to do this to Paddington!",Paddington

But this film & its sequel definitely have lots of feel good aspects, not to be missed. From the fantastic recreations of jungles in South America, to the scenes of London, this is a brilliant film that makes fun of many different things, but in a kind & caring way. Paddington shines as the kind cute bear who has a few accidents along the way but always helps his friends and they in turn return the loyalty. Marmalade saves the day 😊",Paddington
125,vistheindian,Cute as a Teddy Bear,7,13 February 2015,"Quickie Review:Paddington is a rare young bear from deepest, darkest Peru, whose home is destroyed after an earthquake. His search for a new home leads him to London. There he meets the Brown family, who offer him shelter till he can find a family of his own. While it is clearly aimed for kids, the lovable characters and their adventures are still fun for adults to enjoy. Paddington is a pleasant surprise due to its charming characters and light hearted humor. It is the perfect combination for a good family film.Full Review:I'm not familiar with the Paddington Bear children's book. So I do not have any previous knowledge on the source material to know what to expect. Still it seemed decent enough from the trailers, so I gave it a shot despite the very limited release in EU. And it was worth it.First of all the bear is very well animated. If done wrong it could easily have been very distracting, making Paddington feel like a cartoon rather than a character. He is the best part of the movie, relentlessly polite with a heart of gold. So many times he would be clumsy and get himself into trouble or accidentally cause damage, yet you can't help but love him. Of course the clumsiness lead to some funny slapstick comedy that kids would thoroughly enjoy. At the same the movie doesn't depend on the slapstick alone, but balances itself out with some witty dialog that adults can enjoy. Additionally the supporting cast was well developed, each of them have a story arc that they go through. I'm sure the parents who see this film will smile at how the transition into adulthood and becoming parents is depicted in this film.If there was any complaint it would be that the story is very predictable. You have seen this story multiple times in other family films. So yes Paddington did take the 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' approach to the storytelling. However, I'm still willing to defend this decision because the movie was executed well. There is no need for revolutionary story or deeply profound philosophical questions at the end. It is a simple premise with a simple villain, likable heroes, and a good message about family and home. Since that is done well, I can easily overlook the flaws.Despite the fact I am not the target demographic (a child or a parent taking a child to the movie) I very much enjoyed Paddington. Its warm innocent charm and humor reminded me of other family genre classics of my childhood. So since it is able to make me nostalgic of my childhood then I must say, job well done.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Paddington

127,ahegde3149,Heart-warming plus hilarious!,7,4 June 2015,"Paddington is an endearing and heartwarming fun for all ages. The story and the premise may feel simplistic and childish. Yet it offers enough excitement with a beautiful mix of slapstick humor and analogy on modern society. The main character, the marmalade-loving Peruvian bear 'Paddington' is sent to London by his Aunt after an earthquake hits their home. There is something more to these bears - they talk! These bears were discovered by an British explorer many years ago who told them they were always welcome in London. But now in the modern day when Paddington finally arrives in London hardly finds anyone welcoming him at a busy train station. Finally, some kind generous family (Browns) help talking him to their home temporarily so that they can find an appropriate place for him later. As expected, the humor is composed of how Paddington, a bear tries to fit in the modern human setting and the end is obviously going to be predictable. Still the charm and innocence of the CGI- bear keeps you hooked. The set-design was splendid and well-detailed reminding of Wes Anderson's work. The subtle take on human behavior is clearly evident. I really loved the sequence where Paddington gauges the characters in the Brown family one by one. You could easily relate to the life-like characterization. It would have been great if the story had not followed the conventional path in the second half (which is quite weak compared to the fresh first-half). The predictable goofy-action climax was quite disappointing. But, overall Paddington was great fun and entertainment. Not only that, you will learn a thing or two from the extremely adorable bear. RATING: [3.5/5]",Paddington
128,Kicino,A heartwarming family movie with animation showing British humor and hospitality,8,5 January 2015,"It has been a while since I last saw a heartwarming animation family movie based on a book series – with British humor. Paddington is a total success.Overall performance is excellent: good plot and script, great art direction and visual effects. Superb performance by all cast with humor. The facial expression and fluffy fur of Paddington the talking bear is just seamless. The whole plot is quite smooth with a British explorer going the Darkest Peru and befriended two bears, teaching them English and British manner. Forty years later, Paddington left his birthplace as requested from his aunt to go to London to look for the explorer as he would be well taken care of. The vivid colors paints the story like a moving picture book, where we follow Paddington's adventure in London. The story flows beautifully as Paddington writes to his hometown introducing the Brown family who initially puts him up for one night but ends up developing a strong bond with him. Totally enjoyable ride and London seems to be so appealing – with a combination of ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""Mary Poppins"" (the umbrella!). It also shows a unique sense of British humor seen from a child's perspective such as ""stand on right"" and ""dogs must be carried.""The structure of the whole production is rather tight. It is so meticulously crafted that not a single frame is wasted and all characters, even the minor ones, such as Mrs Bird (Julie Walters), and their weird neighbor Mr Curry (Peter Capaldi), or even the pigeons all have important roles to play. Everything is connected and many elements appear at least twice to establish a linkage: the pigeons, Mrs Bird, doll house, attic, etc. Of course the family members are excellent: Mr Brown (Hugh Bonneville), a risk analyst looks stern and always quotes statistics to protect his children. He steals the show when he disguises as a maid to look for information for Paddington. The smiley Mrs Brown (Sally Hawkins), an illustrator, adores her husband who used to be much wilder in his younger days. Children Judy (Madeleine Harris) and Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) are as adorable kids as you can get. Millicent (Nicole Kidman), the villain, is like a witch clad in white. She is haunting and scary in her figure hugging outfits and high heels. But like all family movies the story will end on a positive note and prompt you to like it so much that you want to read the book and have marmalade.The movie also stresses on good manner (the bear stare!), hospitality, being honest and accept people who are different from us: all things we have learnt in kindergarten and need to practice throughout our life. Highly recommended for all ages.",Paddington
129,Macleanie,Perfect family film,9,18 June 2019,"I was never interested in this movie but after some seriously positive reviews I thought I'd give it a go. So I was expecting a childish and corny movie to the point of unbearable but what we actually got was a smart, delightful and genuinely funny family movie. This movie made me laugh a lot, its jokes are perfectly crafted and are genius. Its plot is a little basic but the story is not all thats on offer. The animation is breathtaking too, together with a solid mostly british cast. The script is so clever and his paws so clumsy that I can recommend this movie to absolutely anyone",Paddington
130,malmborgimplano-92-599820,Capaldiwatching Paddington,5,29 July 2015,"Though as other reviewers have pointed out the creators of this film took all the spice out of Mr. Curry, leaving him more or less just a plain noodle, Capaldi makes the most of the role. He plays him with a Michael Caine-style London accent and a wardrobe that to me displays the characteristic Capaldean flair for color (a multicolored striped terrycloth bathrobe is a particular standout.)As for the other elements of the film, well, as others have explained so well, this is not Michael Bond's Paddington any more than Disney's Mary Poppins is E.L. Travers'. If you have children who would find this version too vulgar or scary (I know I would have), I recommend the 2006 audio recording ""Paddington's First Concert,"" narrated by Stephen Fry.",Paddington
131,Franklie,More movies like this please.......,8,30 October 2015,"Loved everything but the villain, her storyline (which was too creepy, only good bit was the end), and the main action sequence during which I kept thinking, ""Why didn't they just call the police? Oh, yeah, because then they wouldn't have a reason for this action sequence."" Everything else was fabulous, hilarious, and intriguing to look at, listen to, and follow. Paddington's reaction to the ""dogs must be carried"" sign made us laugh until we cried. Also loved the actors and the music. Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins are two of my very favorite actors. And it was fun to see the cameos.It would be so wonderful if we had more movies like this. High-end look, high-end vocabulary, high-end storyline, and fab actors.",Paddington
132,moviescoundrel,One Fun Bear,8,22 January 2015,"I was quite skeptic that I would thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's just a bear...and it's a British movie...most children/family movies in this genre are decent, just not amazing. This one though somehow overachieves. It's nothing grand, and maybe that is why it succeeds. The story seems true to the literary classic complete with origin story of Paddington, red geographer's hat, and duffle coat. It's the regular daily life things like using the bathroom, brushing the teeth, using tape, etc. that prove to be rather impossible for ole clumsy Paddington, thus creating amusement and humor for the viewer. The supporting cast of the family and protagonists is also decent. I appreciated Mr. Brown's (Bonneville) performance, along with every other family member. They are first reluctant to accept Paddington, but after warming up to him a bit, it's hard to resist a furry bear, no matter what wrong he does apparently. The flow of the movie is unique in that there are catastrophic, humorous events at times, and then just moments of candor within the Brown household that you want to take in. I suppose the villainous scene at the end felt a bit far-fetched, but then again, the infiltration of the Geographer's Guild with Mr. Brown, Paddington, and a security guard was hilarious. The kids loved it, and this one is definitely worth a second look.",Paddington

Consider the adventurers that did head off to South America in search of lost civilizations and exotic plant and animal life. Men like Sir Henry Wickham and Colonel Percival Harrison Fawcett. These were no ordinary mortals, but men steeped in adventure, mysticism and imagination. Their word was their bond. Fawcett would never have been intimidated by any Professional body. Paddington could easily have sported a pocket knife and compass along with his bush hat! I loved the Brown's house, the kids were in complete character. Obviously the son had blasted too many Jetex rocket powered gliders through the roof, so he was relegated to motor driven Meccano models. The whole movie had an impeccable artistic touch.

So that is way beyond reality (tho I wish it will someday snow like that). However, one very true fact about London is that indeed everyone is different and because of that everyone can fit in and feel like home. The magic of London I guess. What the movie emphasised on was dealing with accepting that you are different and feeling comfortable with it. Sad however, to see that Paddington was only able to do that when the Browns did suggesting that the only way to be comfortable with who you are, is of those around you are. It is in many cases true but it shouldn't be and movie developed around this suggestion are indeed not helping to change that. The movie is very hear-warming. Warm family atmosphere and a lot of scenes that made me laugh out loud (literally). Acting is great as well, with Hugh Bonneville being amazing as always. And the editing is also not a usual one which makes the movie great. London is also nicely portrayed and it was a pleasure to see some very familiar places in the movie. To conclude, I would definitely recommend this to everyone (yes, including adults).",Paddington

We did not grow up on Paddington books. There were not too many assumptions made about the storyline, because it was all new to us. It looks like the adventures of a cute bear. The cute factor is good, but will it be silly?Kid's Korner rating: 3.5 stars Parent's Rating: 3.5 starsPaddington is a bear. A bear that can be found in the much loved children's book series. After coming in contact with a British explorer while in Peru, Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) and his family develop the ability to speak and a romantic idea of all things British. After a significant family event, Paddington travels to London in search of a new home. On arrival to London, he comes face to face with the cold realities of modern culture. Lost and desperate at Paddington Station, he is befriended and eventually taken in by the Brown family. Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) is captivated by the kind, little bear who wears a label that states, 'Please look after this bear. Thank you.' Even though Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) desires to find another home for Paddington, the family comes to love the charming, Peruvian bear. Through a series of mishaps and misadventures, Paddington begins to search for the British explorer who discovered his family in Peru, but comes in contact with a museum taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) who has other plans for the rarest of bears.The premise of the story might sound ridiculous, but it is based on a children's book series and it works on the big screen. The CGI animation is best we you cannot tell it is CGI. Paddington looks real and he is a refreshing character in today's cinema. Kids all over the theatre were laughing and enjoying his bumbling and innocent adventures. The director, Paul King, did a wonderful job of moving the story through the bear's world where people seem comfortable with a talking bear. It also was endearing and entertaining to the adults who came along. It was a refreshing take on the family. Many things happened that were completely unbelievable, but it is a story about a talking bear. Turn off the reality monitor, sit back and enjoy a good family film. This was one of the best children's films of 2014.Dad asked the question on the ride home, 'What did we think of the film?' We loved it. Not knowing the characters did not take away from the enjoyment of the film. Yes, everyone in the group from 5 to 40+ years old liked the movie. We all want a talking bear!",Paddington
137,Wirxaw,Certified British child movie.,5,6 May 2015,"Since I can't really find anything good to say about the movie, I'd just say what takes away the points from my perspective.1. Film is cliché ridden and generally doesn't bring anything to the genre. You have seen it all in Home Alone\Garfield and the likes. In fact - movie isn't even trying. Token villain, token family, plenty of property destruction ""fun"".2. I can swallow the American obnoxiousness of Madagascar, more or less, but this movie is what... a tribute of British culture? A mocking? A good\bad example? Hell, and I thought Harry Potter was... culturally imposing. Maybe for a British person, seeing this would be really patriotic, but for people more cynical and less entitled - perhaps there's too much tea and crumpets. And marmalade.3. Pretty much no sense at all. Well, you could say that the story has some ""family"" morale in the end, but... Well, it's not exactly a plot for a theatre movie. Yes, I know that children are dumb by definition and their movies must be cute and cuddly and that's all the IQ they need in their age, but there are just much better movies that befit the age category and still deliver... something.So, yes, it's a cute, cuddly, warm, probably pleasant movie that is otherwise obnoxious, imposing and rather mindless. It's certainly not bad, a good watch with some laughs and positive outcome, but on the 1-10 grade, it really isn't a competitor, isn't anything worthwhile.",Paddington
138,johnplocar,"It's adorable, really freaking adorable.",8,9 January 2016,"""Paddington"": Well this was adorable, sheer adorable and I had some fun with this. It was actually surprisingly good for me, not that I thought it was going to be bad or anything going in. I saw some trailers and thought it looked cute, had heard that it was being extremely well received by the critics, but for some reason I just didn't have my expectations quite as high as this movie apparently deserved. I don't believe that it was any miracle of film by any means, not even in kid flicks, but it was really solid for what it is with likable characters and extremely well done visual storytelling. Paddington is a bear that loses his home and simply needs to find another. That's really all the plot that I wish to go into, not that it is something spectacular and is in-depth of a concept that goes on in this movie. It is just fun to watch and it's nice to see where it goes because even though it is predictable in what happens from start to finish it is a matter of when it happens that is interestingly paced. I enjoyed the pacing of this movie because it takes the ""fish out of water"" story that we've all seen before whether it's ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"", ""101 Dalmatians"", or even as recent film ""The Boxtrolls"" and adjusts the timing of the whole thing in such a way that it almost feels new. I do want to touch again that the visual style of this movie is like reading a children's story book. It is so stylish that I feel like they wanted to make a 2D film really come to life in a really cool way. I thought that it was pretty neat that the visuals, while gorgeous to look at, actually did progress the film along instead of only giving it a nice pretty bow to go right on top. The movie sucked me in fast with its comedy; it was a delight to just come into that opening sequence that spoofed the older, 1930's Esq ""talkies"". It was really cool and the comedy is spread evenly throughout, there's no point where they just throw in a poop joke because they need something every minute to entertain the kids. Nowadays, that is done so often in kids movies that it is more than simply tiresome...it is downright insulting to the little ones as well as anyone else stuck watching. There's no stupid Smurfs to come in and eat blue M&Ms just they can say that Smurf poop tastes delicious. Or the obnoxious slugs from ""Epic"" that come in every scene just to do something annoying so they can make the kiddies laugh. The comedy flows naturally with what is going on during the story, and there's no real way I can describe the laughs in it other than being extremely ""British"". From the nonsensical quirkiness of Monty Python's obsession in cross-dressing to the quick, deadpan delivery of something from Edgar Wright. It's an enjoyable sit for any age; it has a decent message, fun and quirky characters, beautiful cinematography, good balance of special effects as well as practical effects, and plenty of laughs.

It tells the story of how Paddington came to London. It's quite funny, heart warming and well done overall. The special effects are very good, too. The actors do a brilliant job.

141,BillSims28,Five Word Review: Incredible British Charm; Wonderfully Funny,9,7 November 2015,"Based on Michael Bond's perennial children's books about the marmalade-loving, coat-wearing Peruvian bear who is taken in by a hospitable London family, Paul King directs a family comedy film funnier than most of 2014's comedies, despite being aimed at audiences far younger. It stars Skyfall's Q, Ben Whishaw, as the voice of the eponymous bear, along with supporting roles from Nicole Kidman (The Hours), Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey), Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine), Doctor Who himself Peter Capaldi, Harry Potter's Julie Walters and also Jim Broadbent (star of every British film ever).I had low expectations for Paddington. Having seen remarkably few big-screen adaptations of children's books and series with any discernible charm, even the decent looking trailer didn't prepare me for what came. This film is just so damn likable. Imagine, if you are not a hater of the works of Wes Anderson, if he was British and made a film about a bear joining a London family. It's a lot like a less melancholy, more funny and more accessible Anderson film. With inspired Indiana Jones and Mission: Impossible sight gags, and a script which is sharper than any I've seen in a while, Paddington draws several proper laughs across its entire runtime. It's also incredibly charming. Managing not to grin at its non-twee cuteness and refreshingly funny script is near impossible. It's furthermore quite fun to replace the word 'bear' with 'immigrant' in the dialogue and see how little the meaning changes, as London's sceptical and mistrustful locale struggle to comprehend the kind-hearted innocence and purity of the bear in question. I struggle to note negatives, but it's admittedly limited by being in essence a children's film with a children's plot. However, unlike in most cases this barely detracts from the wonderful fun and hilarity of Paddington. I'm glad Colin Firth dropped out of doing the bear's voice because Whishaw was so brilliant in his voice work, with note- perfect comic timing and a certain childlike spirit that nostalgically hearkens back to and perfectly encapsulates the feeling of Michael Bond's charming short stories. Nothing short of an utterly delightful time for all ages and a great film for any comedy fans, Paddington is one of my favourite 2014 films. 93/100",Paddington

Paddington was the one starting at that time so in I went, best decision I've made in ages. I cringed thru the high pitched ""I'm Barbie Super Power Sparkle something or other"" preview hoping that Paddington would in no resemble that marketing extravaganza and I wasn't disappointed. It was intelligent, funny, clever, good storytelling and so well cast I hope the person who chose the actors wins an award. (Dr Who as Mr Curry!!!)By the end of the film I wanted to move in and live with the Browns myself and also went out and bought some marmalade, something I hadn't eaten in years, my guess is that sales have skyrocketed. The storyline is so well done it doesn't matter if you've never heard of Paddington, it gives you the whole scenario of how this wonderful little bear ends up in London. As for accepting the fact that Paddington doesn't seem to raise any eyebrows being a bear sitting alone on Paddington station - well it is England you know",Paddington

While I will admit that even though I read one or two of the books in my childhood, I wasn't too attached to it overall. Surprisingly, this movie is not just my favorite family film of the year so far, it is also officially one of the best family films I've seen in my life. The acting is top-notch, with amazing performances by Hugh Bonneville, Jim Broadbent, and Ben Whishaw as the titular character. The CGI is beautiful, with inventive work done by Framestore(Gravity, Guardians Of The Galaxy). The humor is often smart and subtle, with plenty of British one-liners and slapstick gags that made me laugh out loud. Best of all, the film is SO charming that it made me tear up at some parts. As for the flaws: NONE! Nothing I didn't like! I will definitely get the Blu-Ray for how perfect this film really is! I'd recommend this to anyone whether your young or old!",Paddington
146,matthewtessnear,Love This Book Adaptation,10,3 January 2019,"Paddington the film has won me over, and I'm now primed to read his book stories. The movie does a beautiful job telling and showing the story of the adorable and polite little bear from darkest Peru who finds a family in the Browns at Paddington Station in London. From his uncle's earthquake death in Peru to his bathroom misadventures and 'worrying marmalade habit,' Paddington is just delightful and encompasses all emotions. The movie is family appropriate and family pleasing!",Paddington
147,HillstreetBunz,Great if you are 8!,7,29 March 2015,"I took my eight year old nephew to see this movie, and from the moment Oaddington himself appeared, he was transfixed. Often roaring with laughter, watching him was without doubt proof of the effectiveness of the film with what I presume is its target audience. For me the story, with a text book villainess, was at odds with the original Paddington stories and made it too generic to be really engaging. One of those films that was well done but lacked any real freshness or (surprisingly given the basic premise) and real quirkiness or originality. No Mary Poppins. Although a big success, I can't imagine it lingering and becoming a real favourite. Ephemeral.",Paddington
148,tobydale,This is lovely!,9,25 December 2014,"Just returned from a Christmas Eve viewing of Paddington.... what really good solid family entertainment! An excellent movie.Paddington is animated in remarkable and stunning detail and really looks as alive and vibrant as any Paddington fan would want him to be.The first 30 minutes of this are quite superb - tear jerking actually if you love the original books. There is real craft to the film in the way it looks and the amazing features - including the cut away house which is imaginative and draws in the viewer. There is something here for everyone.There is a flaw - the Nicole Kidman femme fatale story-line. Paddington doesn't need such an unpleasant device or plot line. Paddington is so much larger than life and so much a clumsy and unlikely hero in the books that any film could easily be carried by the character of the bear and his adopted family and their gentle and warm stories. The kind of threat carried in the Nicole Kidman character is NEVER seen in any of the books, stories or other characters. Pity about that then...!Nevertheless - this film is not reduced by the introduction of unnecessary material. It's still a genuinely good movie.There is real involvement with the ""orphan"" situation of Paddington as he slowly comes to terms with a London which is unlike anything he might have been prepared for. I really like this feature which also becomes a tribute to the glories of London complete with Buckingham Palace guards and the contents of their Bearskins!There are lots of allusions to classic movies - especially Mary Poppins, and Mr Brown (Paddington's adopted father....) is very reminiscent of Mr Banks. Indeed - Mr Brown is in many ways ""saved"" by his contact with Paddington and the development of this feature is quite delightful. But this movie certainly stands alone - as Paddington coming to terms with his new life and new family (and his new family coming to terms with him....) are just as powerful and just as involving as any of the other features.This is a great movie. Really lovely - just go out and see it!!!",Paddington
149,kikoydaba3,an adaption from children's story but is made for all ages with its cheeky humor and family drama,9,3 September 2019,"Paddington is an adaption from children's story but is made for all ages with its cheeky humor and family drama. The charm, politeness and likeability of the main character is undeniable, separating it on another class from similar family films. Paddington embraces its themes, humor and drama taking them up to a higher level while remaining grounded emotionally.The main attraction of Paddington lies in its characters. Paddington, voiced by Ben Wishaw, is a catalyst for good to the people around him. The story is about a cub who seeks home in a far away land. Coming from a distant place different from all people, an undercurrent of immigration and xenophobia is present, the former is more prominent while the latter is more subtle. Paddington seeks home promised to his family by an English geographer. Arriving in London, he follows tradition by wearing a tie that indicates he is a homeless child. Initially, people only pass by until the Brown family. The Browns are a dysfunctional middle class family with Henry as their patriarch. Taking Paddington to their home, he is given only a night to stay and find his true home. His quest to find home repairs the Brown and uplifts the communal spirit around his foster home. In particular, Paddington's optimism is felt through the growth of Henry and his family. Millicent, the daughter of the geographer, played by Nicole Kidman, is a good foil to Paddington who seeks to clear her family's name by displaying him in a museum. Realizing his presence has caused enough trouble for the Browns Paddington leaves their house searching for the English geographer Montgomery Clyde on his own. Millicent nearly captures Paddington upon realizing that Clyde is long dead. After a brief battle the Browns adopt Paddington as family, closing his quest in search for home.On a technical level Paul King evokes influence from Wes Anderson with quirky characters, beautiful art direction, score and a strong sense of matching colors. The CGI blends also blends seamlessly with the setting to the point of looking life-like. Paddington, in particular, never stood out as cartoonish.Paddington is one of the better feel-good movies in recent years.9/10",Paddington
150,mikey187-818-899620,Decent adventure but annoying actors,6,3 April 2015,"I thought the film had a decent enough story and the special effects were really good. I enjoyed the parts where paddington was in peru and would have liked to have seen more of his family life and upbringing.The story line is OK, i could have done with a bit more of a twist, say with the adventurer returning in the end or something but my low marks are for the cheesiness of the family, the annoying actors and the directors distinct lack of his own imagination.Firstly the kids are really annoying, especially the boy, why with British films do we have to portray such a goodie goodie cheesy annoying family, im not saying they should be rouges or anything but they were just too cheesy, and i felt the boy especially couldn't act and irritated me with every line he said, in fact just his face irritated me, the girl couldn't act either and the whole family was just too stiff and unrealistic. The director did a few things in the film that annoyed me, firstly by totally ripping off wes anderson with the way he described the family, the way it was shot and how they were described, it was like watching the royal tentebums all over again. Some of the sets all looked like anderson rip offs and then the band playing in different areas just reminded too much of something about mary, the director didn't seem to have his own ideas.For me , the graphics were good, the story was OK but the casting was poor, the acting is poor and the characters are very unrealistic, cheesy and annoying.",Paddington
151,Alex_Kladis,Quick Review,9,29 September 2018,"Paddington is a surprisingly good Live-Action family comedy, the type that no-one seems to make anymore.It's like one of those 1980-1990 classic movies, which clearly targeted the younger ones, but - at the same time - they were interesting and well made and so everyone could enjoy it!The direction is very Anderson-ish and with pretty cute British vibes and the performances are great. From the children and the cameos (many from Harry Potter actors/actresses) to Nicole, Sally, Bonneville and the voice acting of whishaw are all mesmerisingly great!And all those are before we even take under consideration the whole ""immigration"" theme that is ""underneath"" the Picture...Totally recommended it for everyone!",Paddington
152,Incendid,Best live-action kids film of the year!,8,21 December 2014,"When I heard hey were making a film based on a book (that I personally love) I was sceptical, however once I saw the trailer, I wanted to go see the film, then I heard Colin Firth dropped out of the project so I was a little bit worried about the film, then I went to the cinemas and the film was cute and memorable, which is exactly what it needed to be.Paddington is a film about a bear who comes from Darkest Peru and arrives in Paddington Station where he is taken in by the Brown family, and from there shenanigans ensue and so on. Paddington is a film about being different, the state of society and family. The theme of family is what the story revolves around, the Brown family goes from being a distant and strange family to a colourful and peaceful family. The film makes commentary on the state of society and how people don't socialise with strangers who they walk by everyday, and how everything that one person says to another is a criticism and even the lack of healthy relationships between people and in families. However the core theme is accepting being different, Paddington is the example, he is a bear in a human world, he is the outsider, he is different, he goes through all the loops that outsiders go through, he is sad when he first gets to his destination, he is disappointed, he doesn't understand but my most importantly he provides insight into the world he is coming into, he finds the distant relationships, he finds the lack of communication and the lack of acceptance. Paddington manages to wrap all this into a 95 minute family film that is funny all the way from beginning to end and is both memorable and fun for everyone. Paddington isn't a money grab, it is a passionate film that has creative cinematography, good writing, some good performances from Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins and Nicole Kidman, along with some great voice acting from Ben Whishaw and Imelda Staunton. To summarise, Paddington is a serious film about meaning something, but it is also creative, funny, memorable and all around fun film for the whole family, therefore Paddington receives an 8/10.",Paddington
153,jeffreyhillen-364-945381,A film for all ages,8,10 January 2015,"Paddington (2014) tells the classic story that so many people grow up with. When a bear arrives in London after some terrible events in Peru he needs to seek a new home in London. When he arrives at a train station in London he meets a family, and they take Paddington into their family. First it creates problems and a women is behind Paddington.Wonderful, it really was. I used to be one of those kids who grow up watching Paddington on TV. And when you are making a movie of such a classic tale you need great actors to bring it over on screen faithfully. Julie Walters , Michael Gambon , Imelda Staunton, Sally Hawkins and Ben Wishaw Etc. You just have a wonderful casting. A group of excellent actors and actresses who brought their characters wonderfully to the screen. Personally I was really impressed by the performance of Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington, but also Samuel Joshlin and Madeleine Harris were excellent as the children of the family. They gave a wonderful performance.When making a film of something like Paddington you have so many choices how to make this film. But I think Paul King as Director did a wonderful job writing the story and directing the film. The script was beautiful with a great character development. The conversations between the characters are also beautifully written. This film is made exactly as it should have been. I hope Paddington will win the Award they are nominated for at BAFTA. They really deserved to win something. I was also happy to see something of David Heyman again because he's truly one of my childhood heroes and an amazing producer. When others say Stephen Spielberg I say David Heyman. Look forward to see more of him! Well now rating this film is great fun to do. Looking at the performances of the cast and the wonderful script and the beautiful special effects. Like always Nick Dudman did again an excellent job Bafta Award-worthy. I say 9 out of 10. Beautiful, warm, colorful and truly a film for all ages. This movie makes you love Paddington",Paddington

Years later when their home is destroyed by an earthquake, (the not yet named) Paddington stow's away on a ship and arrives in London in search of a new home. This is without a doubt the cutest film I have ever seen. Even as a (nearly) 40 y/o man, I loved every second of it. It's really good, funny, stupid and cute. The film follows it's own rules, by this I mean that no-one is surprised or shocked to be talking to a bear in the middle of London. I highly recommend this movie to anyone in possession of a heart.

158,Lambysalamby,More for the kids..,6,14 May 2015,"Well first off, this film was very charming, Paddington bear was very cute and likable and made me smile a few times. In the beginning of the movie I thought I would love it but it's not without it's shortcomings..Basically the balance of this movie is off a little, the story elements will keep kids very happy but at the same time, the story just isn't realistic enough for adults. That's not to say this is a bad film, its not, but you might lose attention after a while..Overall opinion: Put this on for the kids and they will be delighted, and you'll have a good time, just not a great one...",Paddington
159,HerbieStretch,What's not to like?,8,3 February 2015,"Maybe I liked this film more than I would otherwise have done because two weeks before I saw it I was on holiday at the Paddington Hotel in the area where the film was set. I used Paddington station and did all the touristy stuff. Afterwards I went up north where it had been snowing, so even that reminded me of my hol. Anyway, the film. Paddington the bear is brought to life by being animated to the equivalent of a young teenage boy -a polite, vulnerable, lovable pest of a teenager in a strange land, hoping to fulfill his dream of finding a family but finding London cold and unfriendly. The story strays from the original, probably by necessity to create more drama for the big screen. I feel uneasy saying this as a grown adult but that bear is so lovable! So much so that I bought my girlfriend a toy Paddington. The acting from all parties in this is good, appropriately pitched for a kiddie watchable film but not too prim. Julie Walters nails the housekeeper. A feelgood journey.",Paddington
160,kevin-38242,"Good, but not the Paddington I remember",6,15 September 2015,"Paddington (the film) is a kids' adventure movie -- think Indiana Jones with fur. That doesn't make it a bad movie; in some ways it's very good indeed. The bear animation is staggeringly convincing, in fact. The story is witty and good-natured, and there are many funny moments.The problem for me is that it's just not Paddington. The Paddington stories that were such a feature of my childhood, and which I read to my own children, were more than just good -- they were inspired. Paddington never does very much in the books -- he certainly doesn't run around being shot at or scaling tall buildings. He just exists to throw the latent humour in everyday situations into sharp relief. The Paddington books were that rarest of literary achievements -- stories for children that were capable of amusing and entertaining their parents as well.I rather suspect that the original Paddington would be difficult to portray in a movie, because the humour is just too understated. To be fair this movie captures at least some of the original charm and colour of the stories; but it loses the subtlety.Sadly, I probably would have given Paddington a higher score if it had not been called Paddington; if, in fact, it had been about a different bear altogether. Or a gopher, or an ocelot, or a moose. Not a dog -- there are altogether too many talking-dog movies. Unfortunately, the literary Paddington has big shoes (or wellington boots), which the movie representation does not really fill.",Paddington

162,IanAJohnson,This film was quite charming.,7,2 March 2015,"Paddington is based off of a series of children's books and is about a talking bear that travels to London to find a home. He has never been in an urban environment before so he has no idea how to interact with others in the modern world. He is then discovered by some random family and taken into their home. First of all, this movie was based on a storybook and it is very aware of that. The characters all have the vibe of a storybook character; not quite real, but real enough to connect to. They are somewhere between a caricature and a real person. Watching the movie feels like reading a picture book to a child. The family is interesting to watch, with each person adds a little more charm to the film. The focus of the family is completely on the father, though. He experiences all of the growth and character development, but the other family members assist that growth rather well. The C.G.I is very, very good. Not only does Paddington almost look real, but there are some other very clever visual effects that really add to the movie. These clever uses of transitions and computer generated effects that add this hint of fantasy to the film. One of my favorites involves the use of a doll house to help explain the family dynamic. This is definitely a family movie because it will appeal to both adults and children. While most of the slapstick comedy is meant for kids, there is a lot of situational comedy that will crack up adults. There is a villain subplot that is initially just tacked on but comes together by the end. The villain is a taxidermist that wants to stuff Paddington and put him in a museum. At first I didn't buy the villain's motivation at all. The only thing special about the bear is that it can talk and has a personality. Stuffing it and putting him on display doesn't seem like a smart thing to do, but by the end there is a decent justification for it. In the end I really enjoyed watching Paddington and would recommend it.",Paddington

164,cashmere-12,Great Movie Even for Adults,10,31 January 2015,I did not know anything about Paddington Bear going into the movie that is why we went. I throughly enjoyed it was kind of worried with all the kids there but once the movie started not one peep out of anyone in the theatre. It held everyone's interest from start to finish.We found out the history of Paddington Bear and his family in Peru. Nicole Kidman playing a villain again was fun. The special effects of the bear was great. He didn't look phoney you would almost think you were watching a real bear in some of the scenes.All the actors especially the mother were great. She brought the fun and laughter. The whole family were great. This is going to be a classic.,Paddington
165,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,Smart and Sophisticated: Nothing Teddy-bearish about it!,8,18 January 2015,"I have seen it 7 times now!My 10-year old daughter loved it and I did too. Nothing teddy-bearish about Paddington! This is a smart, heart-warming and sophisticated film. The story is told as magical realism: Paddington is a talking bear amidst humans. Paddington it's filled with surprise, heart, suspense, and funny moments. We learn about the world of this special bear and we follow him on his London-city quest. There's no time for boredom. The action and the exposition are handled in a very entertaining way. We connect with the characters and get involved in their predicaments. There's emotion and growth: all weaved in a web of funny complications. There's material for the children and for the adults to enjoy and challenge your mind and engage your feelings. You'll click with the bear. Paddington is so naive and good-hearted that he gets himself easily into trouble. Nicole Kidman makes the perfect villain. Eventually we learn why she turned wicked and we even empathize a little with her. Sally Hawkins is brilliant and her character is genuinely sweet and loving--similar to her performance in Persuasion (BBC Jane Austen collection). Hugh Bonneville makes a wonderful grumpy and overly-cautious father. At first he is all numbers and calculation, but at the end he has a change of heart. Paddington turns the family dynamics upside-down all for the better!You will love the marmalade moments...So citrus-y and sticky! Sometimes the humor is a bit silly though. Paddington gets into such entanglements. But then, shouldn't you expect that from a ""wild-bear"" that is behaving human and living in a house? The special effects are fantastic: the animation is seamless. You really think is a bear interacting with the cast. You can feel his soft fur. Quite realistic--I loved the bear growl. And the music? The touch of calypso music—excellent contrast! Added visual delight: the vibrant colors and settings—London and the Natural History Museum. I also appreciated the variety of camera angles, it draws you right into the scenes.There's also a profound message: that of tolerance and authenticity.Overall, the film delivers what it promises (comedy for family and animation) and goes beyond that. The script is an adaptation of Michael Bond's Paddington Bear children's books. I have never read the collection, but now I will.Enjoy! Cheers.",Paddington
166,OperaTarte,May I Say a Small Masterpiece?,10,3 February 2015,"A masterpiece needs to excel above normal expectations, 'Paddington' does that in masses.It's child-like, not childish & proof are the two screenings I attended the first with a near 100% filled capacity, the second nearly the same. Most were adults, couples, singles - ages ranging from 20 somethings to middle aged. All this in the west-side of Los Angeles, and that is saying much. The cast was perfect, everyone melded together at their best. You never once feel that Paddington is not 'there' the way the actors genuinely interact with him.

A grumpy paterfamilias, a tender granny, a weirdo girl, who live the typical evolution of (Christmas) characters facing the bad-wicked-ready to anything-which is certainly scary to look at the face-bloodthirsty. And then there are blows, there are falls, materially impossible misfortunes, a goody guard who suffers a crush of love for a man bizarrely dressed as a woman, there is a band of music, the music of the band, there are grotesque machines, and thieves, and cops and blah, blah, blah. Although I am not English, and the British will forgive me if I am wrong, seems to me detected a certain familiar version of British humour in the story. A chain of gags, in fact, that may not be hilarious to everyone but what's the matter? It is very well produced. Its singular aesthetic gets an attractive indeterminacy of the age in which the story is set. Beautiful visual tricks and very well detailed photographic magnetism. Look at that sets! And what a beautiful portrait of the monumental London! Our hero, by the way, is adorable. But not in the way of too much adorable pets. This guy has manners; He has received a good education from his elders. A demonstration of how anyone with aplomb and education should be able to go anywhere. A little hymn to the cohabitation.

This was a really fun movie with some great performances from the likes of Hugh Bonneville (Mr. Brown), Ben Whishlaw (Paddington) and Julie Walters (Mrs. Bird) to name a few.

171,film316-125-427677,The Bear necessities,10,1 February 2015,"Paddington bear is more than just a story or a toy in British society, he is an icon, he is a hallmark of England and everything it means to live in this country, so with this in mind the reel question is will this new live action animation just panda to the masses? As a child I can't really remember Paddington being a big part of my life, I remember the animated show on T.V. from somewhere and that's about it, I know for some people it was an entirely different manner, I know that for some Paddington was so important, and truly? I believe this movie has done them proud.In its essence Paddington is about a very clumsy, lovable bear and the family he lives with. It's the adventures that Paddington gets up to that really make the story come alive. He is so very clumsy and it is beautiful to watch on screen. To watch Paddington reminds me of how it must have felt to watch an incredible physical comedy actor perform like Norman Wisdom or Charlie Chaplin, to watch a master at work is always captivating.It's more than that though, Paddington appeals to us as a nation because he represents what it is to be British. The chase sequence in the film shows this best.The film is also incredibly smart and funny, it has moments of shear brilliance mixed in with all the other kinds of comedy you would imagine from a strong family event. This comes mostly from the writer Paul King (who also directs the work), he is famous for directing The Mighty Boosh. I truly believe it is only from a mind so Macabre that you could get a work as eloquent as Paddington.The other thing that Paddington has going for it is that he is so sweet as a character and Ben Whishaw presents him perfectly. Whishaw is a man who has unlimited potential, from his early beginnings here is a man who watch in the future.I know that Paddington the character is a two pronged attack, not only is it his voice but also his presence that works in tandem to create the charming young bear. The animation for Paddington is incredible, every follicle of hair is accounted for and perfect.Paddington is the sort of movie you will take your children to see when they are tiny and they will laugh and enjoy the bear, then you will watch it again with them when they are a little older, and they will laugh at the jokes and love the silliness of the bear, then again you'll watch it in their teens and they will understand the love dynamic of the family and then you'll watch it with them as adults and they will see the film for the piece of cinema it really is. This is a film that is built to last and for generations.Paddington is a family film for the entire family, it is upbeat, touching, funny and British to it's very soul.",Paddington
172,mr-abarton,Fun for All,8,15 December 2014,"A small lovable bear from Peru, sees his future in London and stows away on a ship bound for England. However, he finds himself lost and alone on the platform at Paddington Station and the city life he dreamt of soon seems a million miles away.However his luck suddenly takes an upward turn as the Brown family spot him and read the tag around his neck ('Please look after this bear.Thank You.') They offer him a temporary place to stay why they try to find him a permanent new home. The little bear thinks he's hit the big time when he receives an attractive offer of a permanent home from Minicent. (Kidman.). However, he soon discovers that Minicent's plans for him are far from honourable and finds himself in all kinds of trouble.From the minute he arrives at Paddington Station, you just simply fall for the innocent, slightly mischievous children's favourite, making his big screen debut. This live action movie, as you'd expect is aimed at the younger audience, but the strong cast, which includes Jim Broadbent, Nicole Kidman, Julie Walters and Dr Who's Peter Capaldi ensures that there's enough going on for the Mums and Dads.The movie is colourful and well made, with the interaction between Paddington and his surroundings, cleverly handled. The movie can boast some good, if not memorable performances in the shape of Nicole Kidman's evil Minicent, who tries to hide her true plans from Paddington. Mat Lucas is funny as the hen pecked Cab Driver. But the show is stolen by Paddington, who is beautifully animated, with his voice supplied by Ben Whishaw of Skyfall fame. The laughs come thick and fast, as do the thrills in this enjoyable live action movie. Grown up's keep your tongue firmly in your cheek and you'll have a blast.",Paddington

The extra touches in both sight and sound that he brings to the film are brilliant - but I shan't specify what they are, for fear of spoiling the surprises.The film walks a fine line being cute at times, but it never becomes cloying or overly sweet.

175,ryanmoynihan,Paddington aint got nothin on my boy Winnie the Pooh,6,22 September 2020,"The visual gags and slapstick jokes are funny and set design is vibrant in its various pastel colors. The characters are entertaining in their own uniquely silly ways and Ben Whishaw's voice acting is perfect. But it rarely rises above average family film afare. There's a cliched villain with a tacked on back story towards the end to help build tension but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Neither is the overall arc of any of the cast of characters we follow. The father learns to let loose a bit and welcome Paddington into the family. The mother falls in love with her new heroic and heartwarming husband all over again. The jaded teen becomes friends with the strange newcomer and lets her family into her personal life. It's all too familiar and nothing in the story elevates the material beyond unoriginality and surface level character development. It was sweet and fun, but I don't ever see the need to watch it again.",Paddington
176,taylorjan-63962,"Laugh out loud, warm, gripping it has it all",10,5 November 2017,"We all loved it. The family including five year olds sat and watched this. From the start, with the exception of laughter, we were all mesmerised. The film is great to look at, with stunning locations and the Brown's house is absolutely beautiful. The humour is there for all ages. Loved Hugh B dressed as a char lady with his wonderful Welsh accent (recognised a couple of actors from Horrible Histories at the records office) . The scenes in the record office are hilarious with clever CGI. I remember shops giving change via those tubes and pods.I hope the reviewer (selffamily?) can manage to watch it again as it's a beautiful, feel good film. So there's a baddie in it? I'm sure Michael Bond wouldn't have objected. Cruella de Ville managed to scare me as a child and many more, as did The Child Catcher in Chitty, kids love this. I can't praise this film enough, or describe how I feel when watching it (warm and fuzzy?)",Paddington
177,creeda1,Wonderful - apart from Kidman character!,7,28 April 2015,"This story of the bear from darkest Peru is presumably intended for young children (readers of the books). I've only read one or two Paddington stories - one concerning his visit to the zoo with a packet of sandwiches, which all get eaten by the zoo animals. In other words, quite a simple tale. I assume I don't need to give the story of the film.... The actual film is wonderfully made - from the explorer's travelogue to Paddington and his family. In fact I thought Paddington was done by dressing up a small boy in a bear suit, his movements are so lifelike! There are lovely poetic touches, such as the wallpaper in the Brown's house, that reflects the atmosphere in the house, and also the sailors swabbing the decks when discussing Mrs. Blair's husband; there is also the touch of the street musicians who act as a sort of Greek chorus. The way the overall story of the family is shown by means of a doll's house is very clever. All the actors are excellent, particularly Mrs. Brown with her interesting clothes! However, the whole story is spoiled by introducing a strange and horrid character - a taxidermist played by Nicole Kidman. The scenes involving her are quite frightening and disagreeable (seeing a tray of dissecting instruments is not my idea of a fun time) - in addition to her character being one of the worst clichés ever. What is the purpose of having this extraneous element - is it for the parents? Can't imagine going to see this film just because la Kidman is in it. I saw the film on an airplane going to Australia and watched it twice - fast forwarding her scenes the 2nd time. Paddington's voice is so well done all his emotions are conveyed. The scene at the train station is particularly good, when he is sitting all alone...I have friends who brought their grandchildren to see the film and had to leave the cinema because the children were terrified! Not much repeat business there I think!! So, only giving it a 7 out of 10",Paddington
178,rockinannie,Paddington is cute and funny,10,15 November 2019,Paddington comes to London with his aunt Lucy after his home is destroyed by and earth quake. Aunt Lucy is to old to travel on so moves into an old bears home. Paddington is in hopes to find a new home and that is when he meets the Brown family. They take him in reluctant at 1st but grow to love him. Paddington does some funny stuff like cleans his ears with 2 tooth brushes and floods the bathroom and the bathtub sails out of the bathroom down the stairs. Paddinton even catches a crook who drops a wallet. The Brown kids love Paddington esp Johnathan Brown. At 1st Judy Brown don't like him but she does as the movie goes on. Mrs. Mary Brown is the mother to Judy and Johnathan and her husband is Henry Brown and Mrs. Bird lives with them too. Henry Brown thinks that Paddington she be brought to a place where he could find a home something like an orphanage but a little different. Paddington says he could live with the old explorer who had visited his aunt and uncle years and years ago he's the one that gave his uncle the hat Paddington wears today. Turns the explorer's daughter is evil and wants to stuff Paddington and put him in her museum and that's when Paddington learns how much the Brown's really do love him now when they save Paddington from the evil explorer's daughter and in the end the explorer's daughter has to do hours of community service. Paddington found his home and that was with the Brown's. Paddington is a movie that all ages could enjoy cuz young kids would love Paddington as much as adults or teens could.,Paddington
179,navi23,Really REALLY sweet movie!,10,7 December 2014,"Long time since i've seen such a sweet and cute movie! :)I love movies that don't show too much in trailers (Interstellar is another one that surprised me very much, and Paddington is the latest one). From the first moments you realize you're seeing a really nice and cute/funny work of art that floats well in this period where the Christmas spirit begins to make its presence felt.Camera work, CGI for the sweet bear, British humor - all are so close to perfect...But - better see it for yourselves!

181,xpigsu,10/10 please look after this bear...,10,7 February 2021,As someone who has fond memories of Paddington in my youth I was dubious. I found this movie to be fantastic! I absolutely love it and I am often the one asking the kids to put it on.,Paddington
182,jeffdrollins,Effortlessly brings ideas from the past into the present day!,7,16 January 2015,"Author Michael Bond's series of children's books based on Paddington, the impossibly polite and mischief prone bear who hails from ""darkest Peru"" have been a literary staple for over half a century. He's been the star of numerous animated television series over the decades but it wasn't until this year that the beloved bear would make his debut on the big screen. And so I went in to Paddington with two questions on my mind: Does Paddington the film give this children's literary icon the proper launch into the world of movies it deserves and, more importantly, do movie audiences in 2014 even care about a relic of the past like Paddington?To answer the first question, yes! Paddington is a fantastic family film that manages to deliver its overall message of ""families stick together"" without being too cloying or sickeningly precocious in doing so. It also boasts a terrific cast featuring Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey) and Sally Hawkins (Jane Eyre, Never Let Me Go) as Mr. and Mrs. Brown, the loving parents whose home Paddington finds himself being welcomed into. Bonneville's Mr. Brown is a surly, straight man, spewing some of the film's funniest lines in his deadpan English droll while Hawkins acts as the proverbial ""heart"" of the Brown family, always eliciting smiles rather than eye rolls. Nicole Kidman chews the scenery as the scheming villainess Millicent intent on capturing our ursine hero to put on display in her museum.Kidman's turn as the film's villain is menacing but justified, something that is almost unheard of in a children's movie. Her character has motivations that are fully realized and thought out, a trick the film pulls off time and time again. That is to say, this film is a tight and concise work of fiction with all the pieces falling into exactly the right places with nary a single hanging thread to be tugged. It's solid storytelling done in a way that truly serves the quality of the source material and pays homage to past rather than sprint headfirst into a brick wall in the name of bringing Paddington into the future.That brings us to my second question presented at the beginning of this review. Do audiences care about Paddington in 2014? I argue, before the box office tallies have been announced, that yes, there will always be a place for high quality children's entertainment. Of course, the makers of Paddington have hedged their bets by putting the CGI used to bring Paddington to life at the top of their budget. This bear looks wonderful and not once did I find myself questioning the plausibility of an animal and humans interacting as though it were perfectly normal. Of course, no one else in the film raises that question either which only bolsters the fun, cartoonish tone of Paddington.What could have turned out being a disastrous bastardization of a classic piece of kid's literature in the vein of The Cat in the Hat and Where the Wild Things Are instead manages to be something completely unexpected: a film that effortlessly brings ideas from the past into the present day while never sacrificing what made them work in the first place. Paddington has all the charm, humor and good intentions that its hero has embodied for over five decades and is one of the best children's book adaptations since The Iron Giant. Paddington arrives in England with only a suitcase and a note that reads, ""Please look after this bear."" Director Paul King and everyone else involved with Paddington have done just that.",Paddington
183,BrightVibes,Adorable Whimsical Story,10,19 January 2020,The visual effects gave this movie such a whimsical quality. The situations Paddington gets himself into made me laugh out loud.

185,pantelisandreou98,"Paddington is kind-hearted, charming, and adorable",9,5 February 2015,"I loved this movie! The character animation is wonderful, and the story is cute and childlike. I was actually surprised to see Nicole Kidman up on the screen - I admit I hadn't really looked that closely at the cast before seeing the movie. She does a great job as her character, but to me she stuck out as the very recognisable face in a cast of characters played by actors I was not familiar with from other movies. It's not her fault, of course, if I've seen her other work; she's terrific in this movie. The other human characters, all played by actors I didn't immediately recognise, all manage to be individually interesting, which is a great thing to say for a movie. You would almost like to follow each of the children, their parents, even their slightly weird bachelor next-door neighbour around for a day to see what they do with themselves. It would have been easy enough to just have the cute CGI bear in there and leave the human characters as not much more than furniture so the sets don't look bare - this movie does not suffer that problem. every family should see this movie!!! 4.5/5",Paddington
186,summeriris,Charming,9,28 December 2014,"When a film is this charming and lovable it leaves you with a warm glow. I left the cinema with a smile on my face and a deep desire to find Paddington and give him a warm hug. Voiced by Ben Wishaw, Paddington is the bear we all wish we could find who needs a home, even if he doesn't know how to use the 'facilities' very well. I think Colin Firth made the correct decision to bow out, he has a great voice but it's not really Paddington's. That Paddington is found by the Brown family is our good luck. Great performances by all the cast, a funny and clever script and great direction, this is the perfect family film for all to see and appreciate. It's not to little to say I loved it.From the opening scenes with Paddington and his family in 'Darkest Peru' to his search for a home on the cold streets of London our heartstrings are pulled, tugged and then wrapped tightly around him. And I hope that all those people who feel strongly about illegal immigrant children entering countries by unconventional means can find it in their hearts to welcome him also.

It didn't matter to me that myself and my husband were watching it without the cover of escorting children, family movies are probably one of the most satisfying things out there to watch when done as well as this one was.Cute is an understatement to describe Paddington Bear: he is simply warm and cuddly and I fell for him wholeheartedly. I may even add PB to my Christmas list of wants, even at my great old age. Adult comedies can engender one or two laughs, if you're lucky, but this family fun trip had me and the audience laughing throughout (apart from the odd serious moments where it wouldn't have been right to do so). Everything was right: the colours, the cast (except I'm not a fan of Nicole Kidman: her pert nose, pert bum or whispered speech), and again...I was entranced by the great warmth of the entire piece.Folks, go see this one, whatever your age, with kids or without. You'll all love it, I'm sure. My hubby hadn't wanted to see it, but he thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended. I'm sure it will grace many TV screens at many Christmases for many years to come.",Paddington

The animations are lovingly detailed and of irresistible cuteness. The humor is wonderful quirky and endearing. It was a welcome change to laugh many times about a film that is essentially free of blood and death.Nicole Kidman is wonderfully funny and nasty as Museum Director whose vocation is the stuffing of animals. The Brown family with the great Sally Hawkins as mother and a sympathetic stuffy Hugh Bonneville as a father is full of hilarious absurdity.The Movie is one you can really watch and enjoy with the whole family and there will be no doubt that everybody will love it.",Paddington
192,aleksandersochan,"Close, but just shy of meeting the mark.",6,9 February 2019,"This movie has some very nice Wes Anderson-esque (I believe inspired) shots that were enjoyable to spot out. It opens with a relatively intriguing act one, and throughout the movie serves some wholesome laughable gags as well as moments of stress and worry for the main character.Despite this, I did find that the plot moved a long in a rather uninteresting way. There were notable moments of emotional connection when bad things befell Paddington, but overall the plot itself did not hold a strong continuous grasp of my attention. The beginning of this movie was in my view its strongest point.Furthermore, I think the acting and dialogue of the supporting human cast doesn't do the movie any favors. Particularly the child acting, which despite the guilt I feel in calling them out, did not meet the mark. In addition, the young characters are also actually a pretty good example of how the writing in this movie can come across a bit less thorough at times, here presenting some very uninspired and cliche child stereotypes.I believe the strongest portion of this movie is its style which very modestly approached the perfected visual stylings of Wes Anderson. Unfortunately, this noteworthy, yet not meddle-worthy homage, gets washed out by a less than captivating plot and poor theatrical performances.I would not recommend this movie as a stand alone film, but as I have heard good things about Paddington 2 and have yet to see the movie myself, I can't really advise either way in the context of pair. I plan to edit this review post viewing Paddington 2 with my conclusion.",Paddington

The affects for the animals are so pure and authentic, as Ben Whishaw nails the innocent, fluffy bear of endearing idiocy and moral soundness. The supporting cast are perfect to put the spotlight on Paddington, who comes into his own as an outsider in an alien world. The editing is some of the best I have ever seen.

It has everything from tears and laughter, action and suspense, drama and tongue-in-cheek, beauty and amazing design, amazing FX and animation, Great direction and spot on acting. I am not saying this only because I loved Paddington since I was a kid, but because those who made this movie knew exactly why Paddington is such a lovable character, and not just made him justice but really amplified his greatness too. It is a movie for everyone, because it is so full of various layers and different hidden overtones. In its core it is a family slap stick, but in every sentence uttered the script hides messages between messages of love, friendship, kindness, embrace and understanding, and most of all to let go of fears.

I expected him as the voice of Paddington, but this attempt failed. I am so disappointed how this comedy film looks like without Firth himself. Did the studio wanted this comedy film without him because a younger voice actor voicing Paddington would be the best idea? Anyway, I am disappointed. Regarding Colin Firth's voice-over work, I believe that he voiced Fred in Disney's ""A Christmas Carol"" (2009). That really surprised me and Firth gives his best to became a voice actor. I would like to see Paddington with his voice. I support Colin Firth's ambitions as a voice actor.",Paddington

It didn't need that comment at all. Other comments like ""an exotic boxer I met"" again slightly inappropriate whilst been shown a half naked picture of a boxer, Why not ""a boxer I met""? Just lots of little things like that, explaining to my 5 year old what they meant. Theres also the images of an orphage which I thought insensitive.

201,smilefumble,Thoroughly enjoyable for all...but it feels like it's missing something,7,31 January 2015,"In December of 1956, a man named Micheal Bond noticed a lone bear on the shelf of a toy store in Paddington Station, London and decided to buy it as a Christmas present for his wife. She loved the little stuffed toy so much, that Bond decided to make it the star of his first book and in 1958, ""A Bear Called Paddington"" about a refuge bear from the jungles of darkest Peru who made his way to London where he got taken in by the kindly Brown family was published. Since then, Paddington has spawned an entire book series of more than ten volumes, thousands of stuffed fact-similes and most recently, a 1997 animated TV-series by Cinar Entertainment.In fact, it was Cinar's offering in the world of Paddington that first introduced me to the character. Every Saturday morning I would have great fun watching the adventures of the bear in the red rain hat and blue duffle coat who was always well-intentioned, but always ended up in some kind of mess. However, he'd always find a way out and be rewarded for his kindness in the end. So, I was very curious to see if Hollywood could do justice to this super-lovable-in-every-way character. The answer is...mostly yes...but no on some other levels.Unlike recent cartoon-adapted live-action films such as ""Garfield"" and ""Scooby Doo"" where the CGI on the main characters is laughable, Paddington looks super cuddly, like something you want to hug. On top of that, the actor who voices him does an excellent job of capturing the polite, but still ""determined to make things right...no matter what it takes"" demean or the television character had. The antics that he gets into, such as flooding the bathroom or zipping through crowded streets on a kite while chasing a burglar are a treat to watch and will have you ooing-ahing and laughing every time they take place. Of course, just Paddington's antics alone are not enough to carry the movie, so they need some sort of antagonist to create more tension. We get one, in the form of a greedy museum curator who wants to make some major moolah by adding the rare Paddington to her collection, played by Nicole Kidman. Her character isn't very interesting; she's your run-of- the-mill greedy villain that we've seen in nearly every other movie. However, she continuously chews up the scenery with her bob-haircut, skin-tight dresses, flaming pink lips and silken voice every time she makes an appearance, making her enjoyable to watch. As for the other actors, they were all very fitting casting choices and make their characters into ones you really want to spend time with. Particularly good performances come from Mr. and Mrs. Brown (Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins) and their two children (Samuel Joslin and Madeliene Harris.)However, and this is my only gripe, some of the actors get little to no screen time, so that their characters end up very under-developed as a result. Julie Walters, who plays the housekeeper Mrs. Bird, does get a little bit of development in the end when she has to play shots to distract a security guard, but for most of the film, we don't know anything about her, outside of the fact that she's the housekeeper. Peter Capaldi, who plays the Brown's pompous neighbour Mr. Curry serves no purpose other than to be a brief plot device in Kidman's story arc, which is a real shame because the man who always shouted ""BEAR"" when Paddington broke something of his that he was trying to fix was one of the best parts of the show.I really do feel that the movie could've benefited from being about 30- 40 minutes longer in order to give the virtually wasted actors something to do.However, that aside, if you're looking for a good, clean movie to take your whole family to, or even just your significant other to, this is it! Fans of the show or the books like me may be a little disappointed that they cast aside some of the original characters, but will be pleased otherwise.",Paddington
202,nszponar,Just not good enough,4,31 January 2015,Should have been an endearing and heart warming story for small children without too many creepy elements or contrived characters but just seems to be a rather lazy attempt to capture a well loved character without affection for the story. I could not suspend any amount of belief for any of the characters as you are required to do when animals start talking to you. Sommany good actors look like they just turned up for the money. Julie Walters reprised Acorn Antiques with a dubious Scottish accent. Nicole Kidman added a rather unnecessary unpleasant element to the story. Hugh Bonneville played a fuzzy vaguely middle/upper class English person which seems to be his forte. Peter Capaldi just looked sick poor soul and no wonder. The family live in a house that only a Russian Oligarch can afford. Just all wrong. No heart no affection no marmalade,Paddington

I was actually quite shocked at how funny it was. I laughed from beginning to end. There's a lot of smart Adult jokes that will go over the kid's heads. I really liked how it dealt with a lot curret issues such as immigration and how British values have changed over the years. Hugh Bonneville was great as a Colin Firth/ David Cameron esque snooty father stuck in his ways. Nicole Kidman was enjoyable as an Evil Taxidermist wearing ""F**k me Boots"", Sally Hawkins who I am a big fan of proved once again how versatile she is playing the ""Airy Fairy"" mother. Also kudos to the 2 child actors. They weren't too childish or cute. They felt like 2 realistic children you might actually know. I hope this movie becomes as big as ""Frozen"" did last year. If you have kids take them to see it. Hell even if you don't have kids go and see it. I can't believe I enjoyed this more than ""Mocking Jay Part 1"" and ""Interstellar"".

205,marygracelia22-926-448565,From Darkest Peru to Our Hearts: 'Paddington' 2014,8,4 December 2017,"'Paddington' was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. In a world that is increasingly accustomed to such acts of terror that dominate our world news and a general sense of despondency it provided a breath of fresh air for young and old alike. 'Paddington' serves as a reminder that if the world seems to forget its manners you shouldn't let it affect you but just give it Paddington's world-famous 'hard stare' by watching this film.The film begins by following the expedition of a British explorer, or geographer, into the darkest forests of Peru, seemingly a long time ago as this segment is shot in black and white. This explorer managed to find a very rare species of bear, who were docile instead of aggressive. Out of sheer gratitude, the explorer taught these bears the British language and manners, which they still treasured after he had left them to return back to his country. They also treasured the idea the explorer gave them of the city of London, as a city which treats nobody like a stranger. However, due to the circumstances in which this family finds itself, only the little one, 'Paddington' (who was not really named Paddington at this point) travels alone one day to try to find the explorer in London. All he has is the explorer's hat and name.I will not endeavour to write the summary for the whole film. It is easily found online. What I think is usually overlooked from any analysis or review of this film, however, is the role of the British explorer and the impact this has on everyone. If he didn't teach Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo all those things while in Peru, they would never have known about London and the story would have ended there. Besides, he could easily have captured these bears and brought them back and make a fortune considering how rare their species is (this is a storyline which is explored in this film). He managed to shape and improve the lives of so many just by staying true to his values and imparting the good aspects of his culture, even if that sometimes means leaving out the distasteful parts as well.The relationship between Paddington and his eventual adopters, the Brown family, is also inspiring. When they first meet Paddington in the train station next to a 'Lost & Found' (the 'Found' part of the shop's sign is initially broken), Mr Brown thinks he is just another salesman or con-artists with another one of such exaggerated stories like Paddington's. When I first saw the film I thought the film was trying to make a comment on immigration, and I believe there are enough details to argue so. But Paddington's innocence manages to convince Mrs Brown, and Mr Brown agrees to keep him in their home until they find other places for him to stay, just ""for one night only"". The Found part of the shop's sign lights up again, and this is the start of a beautiful story that will charm so many children's homes around the world. The director, Paul King, expertly manages to convey the emotions and detail that are to be found in a story such as this by carefully applying techniques such as these to the screen.The story itself is very charming. Much of the casting is exceptional, with some of the finest British actors being represented here, such as the brilliant Hugh Bonneville as Mr Brown and the inspiring Peter Capaldi as Mr Curry. Is it just me or is just Simon Farnaby absolutely hilarious in his role as Barry the security guard? He does make another appearance in Paddington 2, so someone else must have found him as charming as I did.There's a lot to say about 'Paddinton'. I do believe it deserves a spot among our beloved family-friendly classic films like 'Home Alone' and 'Matilda' as it does possess all the right ingredients, like a nice story, lovable characters and excellent exploration of certain themes like family and immigration. Paddington has managed to become a household name around the world. What a far cry from the labyrinthine forests of Darkest Peru!",Paddington

207,letuannghia,This warms my heart,8,23 May 2021,"It's cliched in a lot of parts, yet the movie is made with so much heart, passion and playfulness in its execution that it's hard not to fall in love with it, with the Brown's family and with Paddington's journey to find a home. A very chill and soothing movie to watch at night, cuddling with your family and loved ones. Also Nicole Kidman rocks the look.",Paddington
208,cooperm-26264,"Bear-ly passable, plot-wise, but nothing too grizzly",7,23 December 2015,"The classic children's books by Michael Bond about the adventures of 'Paddington', an English-speaking bear from Darkest Peru with a penchant for marmalade, have delighted young and old alike for more than fifty years. Now, director Paul King presents us with a theatrical adaptation – one which has garnered high praise from both critics and audiences. Paddington follows the adventures of the little bear and his guardians, Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo. After his home in Peru is destroyed in a horrific accident, to which Pastuzo sadly falls victim, he heads to London in an attempt to locate the explorer who visited his home many years earlier. In the meantime, a family of four take him under their wing, much to the chagrin of the man of the household, Mr Brown, played expertly by Hugh Bonneville. Naming him 'Paddington', the little bear finds himself settling in, and draws ever closer to finding the explorer, discovering that the hat he wears, passed onto him by his deceased uncle, in fact belonged to the explorer. However an evil taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) is hell-bent on exacting revenge on the unsuspecting bear, and proves something of an obstacle for him and the Brown family. From a technical standpoint, the film is amazing. The live action blends seamlessly with the animation, which is both flawless and beautiful. The detail is extraordinary, and Bonneville's interactions with the little bear in particular are conveyed as no less than natural. In all, it really is a visual treat. The performances are tremendous too, with Bonneville leading the live action cast, and Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris and Samuel Joslin following in their roles, constituting the family and main ensemble; they convey themselves as a very convincing family unit. Peter Capaldi as Mr Curry the neighbour was also a nice surprise, although I have to admit Nicole Kidman as the evil Millicent left me feeling a little cold. One can't help but feel that she was somewhat upstaged by the rest of the cast – and when a talking animated bear outshines you, let's face it, you're in trouble.The highlight of the picture was most definitely Julie Walters, who steals the show as the elderly but sagacious Mrs Bird. Her scenes are hilarious – a feat which owes itself both to good acting and writing. Likewise, the voiceovers were highly commendable, with Ben Whishaw assuming the role of Paddington, and Michael Gambon and Imelda Staunton occupying the roles of his aunt and uncle. Sadly, however, the plot of the film leaves more than a little to be desired. What opens as a gripping family drama seems to fizzle out about a third of the way into the film, as the plot seems to divert its focus from Paddington's locating the explorer to his adjusting to a domesticated London life. Of course, this aspect of the film needed to be touched on at least, but the film temporarily loses its focus at the expense of crucial character development and even pacing. Much of the jokes in these scenes also fail to impress, mostly as they seem quite predictable and clichéd. Paddington's difficulty using the bathroom, while funny, feels a little laboured and unoriginal. The scene which sees Mr Brown dress in drag to foil a security guard is also particularly excruciating, and is conveyed as being very old hat, so to speak. A further issue to be had with the film is that it's far too surreal to maintain an emotional impact throughout. The fact that the bears all speak perfect English is made believable in the context of the film, but when Paddington arrives in London, nobody is fazed by the arrival of the little bear whatsoever. It all comes across as rather bizarre. Some of the humour is also surprisingly off-colour, to the point where it leaves you questioning precisely who this film is aimed at. Yet, once you manage to put these issues aside, the film is in fact supremely enjoyable. The acting is, for the most part, very good – the main family have chemistry, and that chemistry binds much of the film together. The writing is also mostly top-notch, despite the aforementioned oddities, and one or two incongruent crude and fairly adult gags. Overall, however, Paddington proves to be an enjoyable family feast for the eyes. It's hardly a masterpiece, but it's not what you would call un-bear-ably grizzly. Excuse the pun.",Paddington
209,geekygirl-11825,So awesome!....until the plot decided to show up,7,25 December 2015,"(*note* By ""spoilers"", I mostly mean basic plot details, and one little anti-climatic reveal that...frankly isn't that much of a spoiler. But more on that later. Just figured better to be safe than to be sorry)If this whole movie had been like the first 30 minutes or so, then this movie definitely would've been a 10, it was adorable and sweet and entertaining. But then the plot (as in, the stuff added outside of just the heartwarming story of Paddington trying to find a home)reared its ugly head. Just...why? Why did they feel the need to add a villain to the story? Everything was perfect the way it was. How can I explain?It's just, they made this super stereotypical and bland villain. She kills and stuffs endangered animals because, she's evil, guys! And they give her that platinum blond sharp villain hair, where you just see it and it's like, oh, look, a villain! Not to mention the not-at-all-surprising surprise reveal that *gasp* she's the daughter of the explorer guy that Paddington is looking for! Did I mention the gag-worthy bits about how the Browns' neighbor is constantly trying to hit on this villain girl who looks at least a decade younger then him? What was the point of that character, again? Sorry, I sound really mean and sarcastic right now, but that just because I'm so frustrated that this lousy and bland villain ""plot"" acted more like obnoxious filler that dragged the whole movie down. But, enough about that, let's talk about the actual good movie, the one about finding a home, and how being family is more than just being related. First of all, let me get it out of the way, the animation of Paddington (and his Aunt and Uncle) is really good. He's soooo adorable, and doesn't look awkward in scenes hardly at all. So, there's no need for you to worry about this being a *shudder* Alvin and the Chipmunks or Smurfs type deal. Personally, I've never read any of these books (and I'm thinking about changing that after this movie, yeah, I'm an adult who wants to read a children's' book series, so what?), but for Paddington as he is in the movie, he's just adorable. I think the best way I can think to put it is he's just a little gentleman. He always tries to have good manners, and he tries so hard to do things right, and be a good guest of the Browns. Also he's adorable. I love the scenes of him questing for a home, from the moment the Browns find him just waiting in the train station, to every scene afterwords of bonding with the different family members. I will have this to say about the plot I've hated on so much, the part where the Browns stand up for him and say that he's family is touching. It's a good moment for the whole family. Basically, to sum up this movie, pretty much every scene that has Paddington in it is gold. Scenes that don't are iffy at best. This movie was so close to greatness, if it would've just kept its focus in the right place, and that's in the heartwarming quest for a home; instead of having a half-baked boring villain plot show up and highjack the movie.",Paddington
210,uditsriram,Pleasantly entertaining,6,20 January 2015,"A pleasing movie with a simple screenplay. It was an entertaining 90 minutes although not extraordinary. Just another normal movie about the relationship between humans and animals in this modern world. The movie portrays the busy life of modern city of London and how everybody is ignorant of their environment. The beauty of nature and its activities are often overlooked. It also stresses on the fact that animals are going through difficult times and they have humane feelings like love, guilt, happiness, obsession with marmalade, longing for home.The bear also makes the family realize its lost morales of kindness, sharing and happiness.The story also features a typical 'bad guy' in form of Nicole kidman who seems to be starring in many negative roles lately. So Nicole's character tries to abduct the bear for her own selfish needs and the rest of the movie goes on about how the family tries to save the bear. Overall, a good entertainer for children and animal lovers will enjoy this.",Paddington
211,davis-ed-44,A rough-starting phenomenon,7,10 January 2015,"Before I went to the cinema. I expected the worst. I was going to see The Theory of Everything, but considering I'm only 12, I thought it would be a bit boring (even though I do admire Hawkings) But leaving the cinema, I was astonished.This movie started out rough. Almost slightly sad for the little ones. It starts of with a energetic bear being extra exited for ""marmalade day"". I have no idea how he could understand the English teaching CD in English if he lived in a complete different area and language. Anyways his father dies in an earthquake, mother goes to a ""bear retirement center"" (How didn't the humans notice this???) and poor Mr.AURGHH was left on his own in a train center (Why didn't paddington just go with his mother in his own climate?, but I guess it IS paddington were talking about) He finds a unique family and from there on a devilish animal stuffer hunts paddington. This is when the movie started to get better and better, I rather not spoil ALL the movie but here are some things that young children will be disturbed by: Paddingtons death stare in the elevator Crazy stuffer-lady is OK with stuffing humans Paddingtons overly-optimistic personality And some tweaks : The whole family runs on marble in the museum with out slipping once. When paddington gets into a sticky situation while trying to tape together the book, in the next shot after he tears the book, the paper is seen without the tear.How didn't paddington bear not die after only eating marmalade and a baguette and the film period is what, 3 whole days? And he does not drink water in the entire film. Apart from this, WONDERFUL movie, I recommend it for ages 6-11 (even though as I mentioned beforehand I'm 12)(PS I'm not ed Davis, I am infant his (again) 12 year old son RYAN Davis) Hope this was helpful!",Paddington

214,theguests-southport,The Bear Necessities,9,1 December 2014,"A wonderful adaptation drawn from the characters immortalised in the books, this film is a major success. Heart-warming and humorous without being mawkish or over-sentimental, the antics and escapades of lovable Paddington Bear will surely delight fans of all ages. How the animators achieved such a wonderful and memorable 'Paddington' is a minor miracle. His expressions and mannerisms are spot on, whilst the cast are obviously all enjoying themselves enormously in being permitted to perform in Paddington's World. It is obvious that a great deal of love and affection has been injected into the making of this film; the acting, graphics, editing, sets and storyline are all virtually flawless, and you must surely be a soul with no heart not to find some modicum of pleasure from this 90 minute magical movie experience.I have deducted one star, which may seem a tad mean after such a glowing review, but that is simply because my family and I wanted the film to go on longer.

215,appledreams4,Watch out for the world's most wanted bear,10,2 January 2015,"OK, I must admit when I looked at the film poster, I had asked myself: How could a feature length film about a British family adopting a CGI talking bear be good? That's why I went into the theater with zero expectation, and Paddington proves to be a huge surprise.As soon as I walked into the theater, I could see I'm the oldest one (excluding those parents), and I did feel a tiny bit embarrassed - sitting alone surrounded by hyperactive children. But then, as the film goes, I found out watching Paddington is one of the best decisions I've made recently, and that is not exaggerating, because as I watched that little talking bear roam around London, I found the inner child inside of me who's been lost for quite some time. I have never laughed and screamed so freely along with those children and I feel totally not out of place.Needless to say, Paddington is fabulously British, and as a Potterhead (proudly saying so), I recognized a LOT of familiar faces (and voices). Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters, Imelda Staunton, even Michael Gambon, and so many more other spectacular actors and actresses are housed in this 95-minutes film. They are one of the major reasons the film is so appealing.The screenplay of the film is impeccably crafted with totally hilarious, literally LOL jokes (some written particularly for children, and some more naughtier ones I'm sure only the parents would get), and also with moments of warmth so sincerely written that my heart has never been so molten before. Paddington truly is a surprising movie, and it surely is the best non-animated family film made in 2014. It is ridiculous yet believable. Unlike the increasing amount of farces that call themselves ""comedies"", Paddington is truly hilarious and heartwarming with a story that is so rich and compelling. And I would recommend Paddington to anyone, and if you have not watched it yet, go watch it and you will find it's the best decision you've ever made.",Paddington
216,jordanrossreviews,"If you or your family are looking for a happy and fun movie to enjoy, go watch Paddington.",9,16 October 2017,"JordanRossReviews: PADDINGTON – 9/10 Rating: PG | Family Friendly: All Ages | How to Stream: NetflixSummary: A young Peruvian bear with a passion for all things British travels to London in search of a home. Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington Station, he begins to realize that city life is not all he had imagined - until he meets the kind Brown family, who read the label around his neck ('Please look after this bear. Thank you.') and offer him a temporary haven. It looks as though his luck has changed until this rarest of bears catches the eye of a museum taxidermist.Review:This movie has a special place in my heart. I had never heard of Paddington before I watched this film, but I can understand now why Paddington is such a treasure in England. What really won me over was how the story was so warm and loving. Although the main character was an animated talking bear named Paddington, I felt connected with his journey and didn't want it to end. It reminded me of the good in people and how fun life can be. This was a warm and heartfelt film from start to finish. The story was well written and the jokes spot on. I laughed harder than I expected and it's one that I could watch over and over again. Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington was truly perfect. I really enjoyed the innocence of the character and how he portrayed that through his voice. The animation was great, never distracting from the story. The other performance that stood out to me was Hugh Bonneville. I thought his role as the over-protective father – Mr. Brown – was superbly acted and his interaction with an animated character very impressive. Another element I liked was the soundtrack. A lot of the upbeat light- hearted tracks went well with the story. London Is The Place For Me, was an obvious fit which now reminds me solely of this movie, plus I found that it stuck in my head for a long time after. Along with the music the sets were memorable as well. From the wonderful antique shop run by Mr. Gruber (Jim Broadbent) to the home where the Brown's lived. I also thought the moments in which director Paul King spied in on the characters through the dollhouse was a creative and nice touch. It's really hard for me to go after this film for much considering how I fell in love with it, but it was not perfect. Nicole Kidman's character Millicent was a bit over-the-top and not what I considered the best fit for the story. Her acting wasn't the issue for me, but more the character herself. The wardrobe and intensity threw me off from the rest of the film, although I did like the antagonist as a taxidermist. Another odd point was the transformation of Mr. Brown near the end of the movie. I enjoyed seeing his character open up and change his way of thinking, but it seemed almost too drastic of a switch. I originally watched this film when it first released but I re-watched it now with my girlfriend who happens to be six months pregnant. We both enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. When I think about our son who will be joining us soon, this is one movie that I know I'm excited to eventually sit down and share with him. If you and your family are looking for a happy and fun movie to enjoy, go watch Paddington. It lifted my spirits and really left me inspired. Paddington 2 releases this year and I can't wait to revisit my favorite bear in London.FILM INFO: Genre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy Directed By: Paul King Written By: Paul King (Written By), Hannish McColl (Screen Story), Michael Bond (Original Author) Release: Jan 16, 2015 Runtime: 1h 35min Studio: StudioCanal",Paddington
217,TLFreview,Cute Little Bear for a Cute Little Film - follow me on instagram for more @thelittlefilmreview,7,29 October 2018,"Well what can I say apart from such a heartfelt warm film. I have to admit that i'm too young to have grown up watching the little bear in my childhood, but what a brilliant idea to bring him back for the new generation to enjoy. Its a true little adventure children can enjoy though their television with innocent laughs for mums and dads.
Learning about Paddington, going on this journey with him invites everyone hearts. I'm just not 100% on the 'problem' in the film, I feel like I was more glued to the character and the family life than the scenario occurring in the film. However Nicole Kidman plays the part down to a tee, playing a baddy that can be watched my children, making them want Paddingtons safety without influencing a scared emotion.
A good watch, with or without children. This film doesn't take itself seriously, the animation is brilliant, which helps you really feel as if the family are living with a little Bear from Peru. I love the real sense of it being a heartwarming adventure with little laughs along the way, however they could have come up with a more gripping 'problem' for the intense climax.",Paddington

The Browns, who live in Windsor Gardens, decide to take the bear in their house, and name him Paddington. Paddington is a troublemaker, but thanks to him, the Browns become a true family. Finally, Paddington becomes a member of the family.
I like this movie. There are two reasons. First of all, the characters of this movie are almost good person (bear). Even if they do wrong, it is hard to hate them. Secondly, there are a lot of parody of another movie, for example ""Mission: Impossible"", ""Back to the Future"" and ""Mary Poppins"". I'm excited to find the parody scenes. In conclusion, this movie bases on children's literature ""A Bear Called Paddington"", so the ending is peaceful.

sure you will have some problems during your first days but once u r used to, no one would leave London. - this is the essence of the movie
Speaking of someone who spent time in London, I have experienced racism, positive discrimination, leaving in a 5m2 room with not most welcoming brits and stuff.
why dont they just make movies who shows reality than fiction? or is it still what we want to watch nowadays? dont you think this cheap marketing doesnt work out anymore? internet is everywhere now ppl do check themselves outp.s.

222,tanernwei,Genius. Wonderful. A new film.,10,19 March 2019,"I find myself wondering as I process this film, as to whether or not I would ever have achieved the level of genius required to decide that such a film as Paddington was needing to be made. The filmmakers behind Paddington have nothing less than my respect and thanks, for this film is gold gifted to an audience who was unable to have asked for it in the first place.The film was surprising, to say the least. The amount of inspiration this film is mind-boggling, in the perfect execution of gags, in the tone and dignified manner in which the film carries itself, yet without the slightest hint of pride it remains, at its heart, about each of our hearts.The film joins an elite group of films who have endeavoured to discover and master filmmaking that speaks our heart's language in its purest form. The heart leaps for joy as you enjoy the film, and the conscious mind follows suit, in a manner so natural that you find your brain working harder than you would have expected, without a neuron breaking a sweat.Paddington was by all counts an excellent movie that successfully follows filmmakers like Pixar in showing us our own hearts, while refusing to sacrifice the wonderful British heritage that the film so beautifully retains in all its glory. The film feels like Wes Anderson on board Thomas the Train having dinner with John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter.A very beautiful film that makes one happy in a way that made me stop and wonder where and when such happiness disappeared from my life. The word ""happy"" seems to reappear in a dark, gloomy, confused world that seems to not have entirely realised that it had left in the first place.",Paddington

Movie uses a soothing pastel color palate staying away from dark, light and sharp neon, this provides you a level of comfort only paralleled by hugging a loved one. I personally, couldn't believe that this was not one from Wes Anderson.

Watching the trailers one might think that it's just another fun movie for kids but there is something for everybody in this film. It is quintessentially British and for lack of a better word, very 'middle-class'. However there are lots of poignant moments in it and actually portrays very good values for children. It is rated PG for Nicole Kidman's role as the taxidermist (she looks great by the way at her age!) which does bring moments of suspense.The movie is shot beautifully and the CGI for Paddington is flawless. Midway through the movie you start to feel for the bear and forget that it's a bear at all! There is a great emotional connection between the viewer and Paddington which I think is the strength of this film. Only deserves a 7/10 as some of the funny moments which were meant for adults did not pull off very well in my opinion and felt rather flat.A definite watch for the Christmas period and a good day out at the cinema for the whole family.",Paddington

230,romanvartanov2014,Nice kind story for kids,7,28 January 2015,"I went to see this cartoon with my girlfriend, because we thought that it was from the creators of Ted and that hence it would be hilarious. But the cartoon turned out to be just a kid story.The story begins in South American jungle, where a British adventurer meets a couple of talking bears. At once they become friends. Many years later the bears' nephew launches upon a journey to London (because his uncle dies and his aunt is going to home of elderly bears) in a quest to find the adventurer. The little bear gets lost on the Paddington station (That is why later he was given the name Paddington), but a nice-looking family picks him up and helps him in his mission. Turns out, that the adventurer had been expelled from the geographical community when he returned from the jungle because he did not bring any trofeys from his journey (like stuffed bears) and that his daughter is now on a quest to correct her father's mistake by killing the little bear. Of course, the good prevails in the end.I personally enjoyed the plot though. It is thought-through and is surprisingly original for such cartoons. I would really recommend you to watch it with your kid, for all the kids around us were amazed.

231,vanderwiellouis,I have seen this movie multiple times in different ways.,4,26 June 2015,"I had high hopes for this movie because it had a pretty high rating in a couple of websites which was surprising because it looked like a cliché movie and it was.I will start this review with positive aspects like the design of the bears and the animations. That is all I can say.When I watched the movie, I honestly thought I watched a remake or a sequel because the concept of the movie has been done thousands of times. An odd looking creature discovers a big city. He is then being taken care by a couple or a family. The woman wants to keep the creature in their home but the man doesn't like the idea. He changes his mind later on in the movie. Meanwhile, a crazy person obsessed with killing that kind of creature wants to take that creature's life with his goofy sidekick. This creature catches the attention of the public somehow and becomes popular. In the end, the villain tries to capture or kill the creature but fails and he or she goes to prison and everyone is happy. I have just written a plot summary of many movies. I am emphasizing the fact that it has already been made and i got bored of the movie quickly.The characters aren't great either. They are all stereotypical. You have got the stereotypical strict dad, stereotypical bored teenager who thinks everything is embarrassing, stereotypical villain who is obsessed with animal deaths and has crazy acrobatic moves, etc...Finally, looking at the genre of the movie, all the jokes were predictable. All the jokes are about the bear discovering human habits. he's obviously not going to do human things so he does something else and these jokes weren't very original.To summarize this review, I felt like looking at a wall for an hour and a half.",Paddington
232,wuawuamusic,Surprised and kind of amazed...,10,28 March 2018,"I remember Paddington from school around 25 years ago. I always knew that it's surprisingly smart for child books.

So, I hated stuff like the Chipmunks movies and most such new film interpretations with originally drawn characters. I didn't expect much. But... wow! I laughed so much and loved all the small details. The writing, the acting, the directing, editing and the CGI, etc... is just enormoulsy great! Everything is so much better than all this generic, stupid Hollywood stuff of today's times. And the movie seems to work even for people that usually never watch such a movie. I mean, I'm kind of a Jim Jarmusch, Wim Wenders, etc... guy. So... 10 stars for sure!",Paddington

234,andreytzibu,BEST MOVIE EVER!!,10,10 August 2018,"For me was the most beautiful, funny, dramatic, emotional movie I have ever seen. I mean first part of the movie was so funny despite the fact Paddington was left alone in station. I was laughing almost at every 30 sec. And the second part when he got kidnaped was..I mean I cryed at the end. This movie deserves more awards . I LOVE U PADDINGON !!!! KEEP SPREADING JOY. IM LOOKING FOWARD FOR 3 RD MOVIE!!! btw this is my first review I edited on IMDb only BCS this is my all time favourite.",Paddington
235,wagamarcin,Quite a nice trip around London.,6,2 May 2020,"Another kinda silly but cute story about anthro bear. Full of bad jokes, but it's able to bear (you see what I did here :D). Bear name's Paddington And as i said earlier he's anthropomorphic animal with human speech and good british manners learned by his Uncle and Aunt who'd learned before by british explorer mr. Montgomery who used to taste in marmalade. Few years later our title hero arrives to London persuade by his aunt who lost husband in accident. Paddington is in UK now looking for new Home.I won't spoil you mid and end of that movie. It's really watchworthy movie about friendship, audacity and bravery including struggling to find a proper place to live and good people surround you. Not only for the youngest, adults also will find something they looking for.My review
Enjoyable adventure with decent plot and likeable characters. Recommend for whole family who've wanted 90mins of rarely seen adventure.
Rate 6/10",Paddington
236,phillbeynon,Brilliant,10,28 December 2019,"From start to finish a wonderful piece of work, scripted, acted, voiced and set to perfection as a warming, family film for all ages to enjoy. The sets and costumes are quirky and excellently designed to compliment the great feel of this feel-good film, and the detail of everything is wonderfully considered, from the colouring to the scoring of the perfectly judged live street band. British brilliance.",Paddington
237,ericdraven1030,A delightful surprise,9,21 August 2018,"Wow! This movie is everything a family movie should be! On the surface this looks like a movie about a funny bear causing trouble in a big city, but in reality it's a story about immigration, colonialism and finding your place in the world, and being an immigrant myself in London I can't help but relate. The Brown family dynamics reminded me the Parr family from The Incredibles, with a very British spin and no superpowers of course, and Mr Brown's journey from stern to playful father looks like a modern version of Mr Banks from Mary Poppins. There are many interesting visual ideas like symmetrical shots that wear their Wes Anderson's inspiration on their sleeve, or a doll's house that opens up and becomes the Brown's home. I also found myself laughing out loud in more than one moment, I can definitely recommend this gem!",Paddington

239,m-contraryel,Better than I expected,6,3 November 2015,"I was pleasantly surprised here, I have to admit.We've been getting several good, solid family films lately that act a little smarter than the typical burp and fart jokes so many have relied on since Shrek became popular. This is one of them.Unfortunately, not many of them really strive for greatness, either. This was a nice rental, but I wish I had rented the $2 bluray instead of the $6 stream.Nothing groundbreaking, nothing amazing, not worth watching a second time, but good clean family fun.Appreciated that this got made.",Paddington
240,ptrcrrn,Paddington bares himself to 21st century cinema!,7,8 December 2014,"I am one of those souls who looks back to their youth with an added relish and nostalgic nod, like most of us I suppose? With that in mind, I took my 10 year old daughter to see 'Paddington' on the big screen at the local cinema here in Dublin. I have to say I was really excited to see this one, after seeing ads for the movie dating back to the summer, it looked good, so was the wait worth it? The answer in a nutshell is a resounding yes. Paddington is a series of books written back in the day, though I do really remember the kids TV show from the 70's all about the marmalade loving bear, who arrives in Paddington station in London from Darkest Peru, is found by, and then lives with the Brown's, a local family who adopt him and initially try to put him on the straight and narrow. Paddington then is seen trying to adapt to Life in 1960's London. The current offering is very similar with it's story-line, and is just an updated, aimed to modern cinema going audience. Studio canal, who have given us this offering have succeeded quite well. I went to see this with my daughter, who is of course a big fan of cuddly things, so this movie was right up her street too, she wanted me to give it 10/10 on IMDb, but we have to stick to the rules here. With lot's of familiar British acting faces and a well timed plot, which I have to say was a little bit scary in parts, but generally cool throughout, a couple of the younger cinema goers screamed out at certain points, but no one left the cinema in tears, so they enjoyed it too. The story-line moved along nicely, and didn't lose any interest over the 90 or so minutes it played out. One thing I must say though and I think it may be a bit of a question mark hanging over it, and it will be the real teller for Studio canal will be what our cousins across the Atlantic will think of it. I have seen some of the 'trailer' reviews on YouTube, and some of them though anticipatory are not 100% behind what they saw, time will tell, Paddington is coming out in the USA on 15th January next year, I hope they enjoy it as much as my daughter and myself did?",Paddington
241,o-flettner,A beautiful story,9,30 November 2014,"This film may be as many others put it, quite dissimilar from the book in many ways. Fact of the matter is though, i simply don't really care. The story was heartwarming, well directed, funny and whether you are young or old, it will brighten up your day. Initially i was worried that it would be too kitschy, or that it would be too childish, however far from it! It is a wonderful story for young or old which really paid tribute to the original story and brought Paddington into the 21st century. My 20 year old girlfriend now wants to learn bear and talk to the bears in the zoo. The only reason why i give this a 9 out of 10 rather than a 10 is that sometimes the jokes and acting was almost too cringeworthy, however that is where you need to remember that this movie is for children, not for grownups specifically. I highly recommend that you guys take your children, take your girlfriends, take your boyfriends, parents or grandparents to watch this with you as you will have a jolly good time! It is a great movie to pass a cold dreary day inside for a couple of hours and escape the dreariness of everyday life!Oliver",Paddington
242,smeyer-03996,Bears Rewatching,9,15 July 2021,"Funny, clever, unassuming, well-cast, and brilliantly acted by an all-star (Harry Potter) cast. Did I mention it was funny? The plot is silly, but even that's a plus. Bathtubs down the stairs (in the trailer) and marmalade sandwiches exploding pneumatic transfer systems are just the beginning of the hi-jinx. And good-on Delores Umbridge to catch Dumbledore. Watch it and laugh; then watch it again and laugh harder.",Paddington

247,jill-banks,What fun for lovers of Paddington,8,24 December 2014,"It is witty, amusing, engaging & sometimes sad. The cast is phenomenal & any film that finishes without me looking at my watch to see how much longer I am going to have to wait to go home is a plus. I loved it as did my husband who was celebrating his 66th birthday & my 24 year old daughter. Very cleverly put together but I'm not sure what the London Tourist officials will think as it seems to portray London as somewhere it rains nearly all the time. Some of the very small children in the 10.05 am showing that we went to didn't sound too happy at times. Nicole Kidman as the villain is an inspiration & Dr Who fans will also have something to look forward to. Even if you don't have loved Paddington bears who are older than your children & outnumber your children, like I do, then find a child or grandchild & go see this movie.",Paddington
248,zpinkas,Not for adults,6,5 April 2015,"Well this movie is good for children but not for adults.I was dis pointed because the reviews on this site was quite positive but the movie was not that good for an adult viewer. The people in the movie wasn't surprised to see a bear who can speak and act like human, that is big miss point from the creators of the movie. Such a shame we didn't see people react strangely when they saw a talking bear who sounds like human.Second, the movie was very predictable and full of cartonish lunacy However there is a comedy in the movie but not enough humor and specially not for an adult viewers",Paddington

It has jokes for all ages, it has a heartwarming adventure and it makes you feel like a kid again.When it was done we immediately went looking for part 2.",Paddington
250,viswa3107,The perfect family movie for this Christmas.,7,21 December 2014,"Christmas brings merriness in a million ways.... starting from family gatherings, parties, presents to movies and TV shows. A ""Complete family movie"" is always appreciated at Christmas time. One such movie is Paddington. The movie belongs to the typical ""family binding"" genre. It has something for everybody kids, parents, comedy lovers. Villain's character resembles the ""101 Dalmatians"" but the movie has its own way of unfolding the little story line. Though previews have compared ""Paddington"" the bear with the movie ""Ted"", the filthy less presentation of a young bear makes this a perfect Christmas family movie. This may entertain you more than the other comedy movie ""Night at the museum: The secret of the tomb.""Obviously Paddington the bear is fictitious but its'arrival to the human jungle is convincing with some little logic. The characterization of Paddington definitely receives applauds from audience. I should say the makers are successful in presenting the Animated/CG in all the scenes and they are more than successful in in presenting the the feelings young and lonesome bear.",Paddington
251,akolkaa,Please look after this bear. Thank you.,10,18 April 2019,"Paddington (actually both movies) is one of the best animated movies in a long time.

Incredible varieties of all emotions is in here. This is an example of how you make a movie!",Paddington
252,annemarie-lowe,Good but not like the book,8,29 November 2014,"I took my nearly 5 year old grandson to see this film. He enjoyed it immensely especially the funny and slapstick bits - but he doesn't know the original story and had no expectations. As a film it's great, though there are a few dark and worrying moments (if you are a child)but don't expect it to follow the original story. The film has taken the characters and woven a virtually entirely different story. Michael Bond has a cameo role - wish I'd known that before I went so I could've looked out for him (I met him once at a Bear-fest in London).Paddington was like enough to the original conception of the bear we oldies know and love from the 60's.All in all very enjoyable - but a little bit of me wished it had been like the book - but I suppose that wouldn't appeal to modern audiences.",Paddington
253,royannmail,"No, No, No!!",5,1 December 2014,"We were very disappointed with all the nonsense running around the Natural History Museum. It spoiled for us what was at times a very endearing film for the little ones and the young at heart. My 6 year old was unfortunately too scared to watch at times. Why turn it into an action movie, it just fell between two stools in our opinion! I would have preferred it to be more faithful to Michael Bond's version. It is always disappointing when the producers choose to change the character of a known theme so much. I guess they feel they are being creative!! Nonetheless the film was beautifully crafted and Paddington was entirely believable and lovable as ever!!",Paddington
254,stewart-196-574270,"Not for kids, could have been good if it stuck to the spirit of the original",1,26 December 2014,"Have to rate this as awful - reason being, paddington bear is a icon for small children, a safe humorous tale of a bear from Peru that a family adopt and then hi jinks ensue. I can buy into updating the story and fleshing out more plot for a film - the hunt for the explorer made sense, paddingtons capture of a pickpocket was very funny as was the escalator piece. They had the recipe for a very safe child friendly movie.However why why why did Hollywood feel that the story needed a sadist psychopath in the plot(Nicole Kidman). Wtf has that got to do with paddington? To me watching this was a great corruption of the innocent mind of kids. My daughter asked - what is she going to do to the monkey? We left pretty shortly after that. I was blindsided by this terrible decision making of the film makers - taking a children's book aimed at 4,5,6 yr olds and adding the spectre of animal cruelty and sadism makes no sense at all.",Paddington

I absolutely love it. 🐻❤️The animation was amazing. I believed that was a real bear with his old red beautiful hat and his blue coat. I'm from Peru like this cute bear and I think the story of Paddington is incredible. I identify myself with him a lot because he wanted to go to England to find a new home and he believed the people here are kind, considerate and would look after him and it he was correct and I think the same because my boyfriend Ben is from England and I am passing my holidays with his lovely family. I realize now why Paddington is so famous here and why the people love him. I feel in love with this bear and I'm now a big fan of his.😍 I 100% recommend this movie for everyone and I convinced it will enjoy it. I hope to see it again in the cinema in Peru too.",Paddington

257,kristinhux,too scary for kids,3,19 January 2015,"I am so tired of dealing with unnecessary violence in children's programming. Went to a child's Birthday party tonight for a 5 year old to see Paddington. My 7 year old and many children in the theater left shaken and in tears. Nicole Kidman's character shoots Paddington with a dart gun and lays him out on a gurney and unzips her scalpel kit. A kid in the back row yelled ""she's gone pull his eyes out!"". Paddington climbs into an oven and tries to escape by crawling up the several story chute while NK lights a blazing fire under him. He gets to the top only to fall in slow motion into the flames and be rescued at the last minute. Then a Die Hard-like showdown happens on the roof. My kids see plenty of movies (recently Annie, Dolphin Tale 2) and are not by any means sheltered. However, they are bothered by disturbing imagery. My 7 yr old couldn't go to sleep tonight after seeing Paddington. I don't understand our culture's need for violence in children's programming. On other programing as well. My daughter happened to be up 5 min past her bedtime last week and ncis came on with a screaming woman tied to a bed and then bloody and dead in the next scene. Are we all totally numb?? How is this OK for a child to see. But yet, people can't curse or show a perfectly healthy alivebutt cheek on TV? So upsetting to have so little control over what our children see. Really assumed Paddington the Bear would be a cute kids movie.",Paddington
258,zepower100,Loved it!,10,27 January 2015,"I had taken my little brother to see the movie he had been raving about since the commercials came onto TV. We sat down with our popcorn and our hopes, and were blown away. The fact that the movie doesn't have more than a 10/10 shocks me. I hadn't thought much of it at first, but it was both touching and hilarious! The one thing that gave me the hint that it may be good is the fact that it was made by the producers of Harry Potter. Rating? 10/10. Watch it again? Wouldn't miss it for the world! Overall, this movie blew my proportions out of the water as to how good it was. The plot was phenomenal, the animation was amazing, the characters were well played. What more can a person ask for?",Paddington
259,michaelhayashi1229,Paddington,8,7 February 2015,"I think it was great seeing our childhood character come to life. Very fun and interesting to watch. Very heart warming at the same time.Everything from the quirky humor, to the British scenery to the wonderfully-animated bear himself is a true delight to watch. The cast are also brilliant. The Brown family feel genuinely real and easy to relate to. I particularly enjoyed Huge Bonneville's amusing performance as Mr Brown, as he overcomes his initial distaste for Paddington and grows to love him as the rest of his family do. Other stand outs include Peter Capaldi, as crafty neighbor Mr Curry, and Nicole Kidman as the Cruella De-Ville- esque villain.",Paddington

I know what some of you are thinking: ""Pshh, another silly 'talking animal' cliché."" However, I guarantee this is not one of them! From the very beginning of the film, you will be swept away into a distant land and along the way, you will indulge in the intriguing world of Paddington.Please give this a chance. Those who have read Paddington books as children will experience what it is like to be finally ""in the book."" Paddington is absolutely original. 10/10 for me.",Paddington

Great family values portrayed... a healthy family unit. The movie essentially says it's OK to be yourself and that we're never too old to learn. Wonderful!I can see us watching the movie again and again...",Paddington

My daughter wanted to add her 2 cents: ""Hi! my name is Alissa and I'm 8 years old I just wanted to say that Paddington was a Terrible Horrible movie and the part that Nicole Kidman played WHY! did you guys have that part. That's what made the movie scary and if you heard people say that Paddington was a great movie I do not agree anyway just wanted to say.""

263,emilymayo-25290,My review of the most entertaining family movie of all time,10,7 July 2015,"I have to state this before continuing with this review, prior to seeing this I was very reluctant and hesitant as to what I was due to view. After growing up hearing the stories and watching the animated tales of Paddington Bear, I was unsure as to whether a CGI-heavy live- action tale could really establish a story that portrays the bear in all his charm, well my predictions were woefully inaccurate. 'Paddington' is a very well-executed adaptation of the titular bear for a 21st century audience. From the producers of Harry Potter, 'Paddington' delivers a family-friendly and charming atmosphere whilst conveying an endearing and gloriously comedic tale about a bear and his adventures in London. One of the late and great films of the year, Paul King's irresistibly warm story creates a sense of nostalgia whilst boasting a quintessentially British feel and pitch-perfect humour that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",Paddington
264,lizzyizzyizzard,Bear called Paddington,10,27 December 2016,"A wonderfully uplifting movie, the life of Paddington, as he arrives in England with his marmalade sandwiches under his hat, all the vitamins a bear needs for a day. All the acting was excellent, from Hugh Bonneville as Mr Brown, Julie Walters as the granny, and all the rest of the cast. There was comedy, drama, poignant moments and all the qualities required for a very entertaining and thought provoking film experience. This is family entertainment at its best, for young and old, can be enjoyed on several levels, light entertainment, fun and comedy, and a thoughtful look at the problems faced by newcomers into a city.",Paddington

266,meenumathurjha,"Stuart Little, if made by Wes Anderson. Kinda.",7,5 June 2019,"Right off the bat, I really liked the film. It's a wonderful mixture of the cinematic sensibilities of Wes Anderson and the wholesomeness of Stuart Little.While a bit predictable, it's really enjoyable throughout the runtime. The beginning, like all films of this type, is really touching and engaging to watch as you see Paddington make his way through the hustle and bustle of modern-day London, which he'd imagined to be more 'welcoming'.
This is classic' fish out of water' scenario and plays out well.The cinematographer has done a BRILLIANT job here. The shots are all immaculately framed with some obvious Wes Anderson inspiration. There are many creative shots (like the doll house shots) which just go on to prove the amount of love and care which went into making this film.However, the characters, either intentionally or unintentionally, are kind of one-dimensional, especially the little girl character (I forgot the name, sorry!) who gets the lamest and most poorly-written character arc which isn't even satisfying and when you think aboutit, she only changes her mind about Paddington when she receives gratification from her classmates. Instead of retaining her identity and remaining weird, she chooses to be 'popular' and 'cool' only when she sees that others love Paddington.
She and her brother have minimal interactions with Paddington and there's not enough to justify the sudden change of heart. Thus, I didn't care about their relationship.Most people will argue that its a kids movie, it doesn't need character decelopment! And they'll be right but when a film is this good in almost every department, making the characters more well-rounded would have made it almost perfect.Overall, quite a well-made family film! Recommended. 7/10",Paddington

Whereas the original story of Paddington is a slow-paced collection of stories and has a subtle charm and sense of humour, this movie takes out the big guns and has a grand and quintessentially horror-based plot underlying it right from the start in order to, feels like, cash in at the box office and avoid the 21st century producer's biggest fear: boredom. These are children - very small people - and they really don't need this to be entertained. The image of the-epitome-of-evil scientist Nicole Kidman running after Paddington, sweet bear and incarnation of innocence, in seemingly endless scenes of chasing through the grandiose settings of the Natural History Museum with the grotesque purpose of killing, stuffing and mounting the bear for display purposes. That big needle, infused with lethal chemicals... Paddington being kept captive seemingly unable to escape his destiny...it haunted my 8-year-old in nightmares following this, and I cannot quite forgive grown-ups who inflict wounds in sensitive souls in the name of entertainment and in order to make money.",Paddington
