0,Leofwine_draca,"Dull, distasteful insult of a film",1,20 July 2016,"Repellent and repugnant. Disturbing and despicable. Devoid of a second's worth of genuine entertainment throughout. I didn't much care for FUNNY GAMES U.S.; in fact, I absolutely hated it. With a passion. It stands as one of the most depressing films I've ever witnessed, and I'm sorry I wasted my time sitting through it all. You see, the reason I enjoy my B-movies is that I know what I'm going to get with them: cheesy acting, cheap gore, a few vicarious thrills and there. When you watch a so-called 'art house' film, you have to put up with pretentious and an occasional desire to offend, provoke, or even bore the viewer.Michael Haneke is one such director. His effort lies in repulsing the viewer, manipulating emotions throughout, playing with their minds. The story of this film interested me; I do enjoy the inherent tension in such home-under-siege movies as HOSTAGE or even the racially motivated FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE. This is the worst yet. It's just a family being terrorised for the running time, with suspense evaporating by the second due to the slow pacing and long scenes where the film sits in the doldrums, doing nothing. There's none of the climatic stuff where the oppressed fight back against the oppressors, just more of the same.Yes, a kid is killed. Does it have an impact? No, because I just didn't care. This film didn't connect with me on an emotional level at all. I was bored by the mundanity of violence. Having the bad guys talking to the viewer, even rewinding the film during the lowest point, I just found ridiculous and stupid. Yes, the acting is good. Naomi Watts and Tim Roth are totally believable as the beleaguered couple and the bad guys, well they're just the most hateful ever. But acting alone does not a good film make. Shame on you, Michael Haneke, for making such a film.",Funny Games
1,SnoopyStyle,violence without tension,5,18 May 2015,"Ann (Naomi Watts) and George Farber (Tim Roth) along with their son Georgie go to their vacation lakehouse. Their next door neighbor Fred has two strange young men Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet). Paul and Peter seems a bit strange and then they take the family hostage. They play sadistic games with the family.Filmmaker Michael Haneke is doing a shot-for-shot remake of his 1997 Austrian original. I've never seen the original and that has no bearings on my review. I find the movie excruciatingly slow. The menace lacks tension. I have nothing against the violence although I don't see it delivering much of message. Honestly, an anti-violence violent movie is a bit late. I guess a violent movie without much tension could be the point. The white washout visual style is interesting. The actors do their work dutifully. I just find the movie a bit annoying and a bit boring.",Funny Games
2,claudio_carvalho,"Did I Press the Replay Button of the Original ""Funny Games""?",1,27 December 2008,"In 1997, Michael Haneke became worldwide known with his masterpiece of sadism, alienation and cruelty ""Funny Games"" and I recall how disturbed I was after watching that impressive movie. ""Funny Games U.S."" has just been released on DVD in Brazil, and I have decided to check what this version could present to the viewers. The answer: absolutely nothing but the language, spoken in English, and the cast. The performances of Naomi Watts, Michael Pitt, Brady Corbet, Devon Gearhart and Tim Roth are outstanding, but they have added no value to the original movie since it is a remake frame by frame of the original film, giving me the sensation that I pressed the replay button of the original ""Funny Game"". Does it worth to remake a movie just to satisfy viewers that can not read subtitles and to fill the pockets of the author? My vote is one.Title (Brazil): ""Violência Gratuita"" (""Free Violence"")",Funny Games
3,gavin6942,"Beautiful As Art, Rubbish as Entertainment",6,16 September 2008,"An upper class couple (Naomi Watts and the wonderful Tim Roth) and their young son are enjoying time at their lake house, ready for some sun and golfing. But, what is this? The neighbors have some new friends... mysterious friends who look like Leonardo DiCaprio and like to kill people. I guess it's not time for golfing since we'll be spending the next twelve hours being tortured, in this shot-for-shot remake of ""Funny Games"".Trying to discern what ""Funny Games"" is may not be easy. It's a horror film, but lies more heavily on suspense than outright horror (Hitchcockesque?) and aims to be a critique of horror films. It's certainly an art piece, but violent enough to turn off most mainstream, non-horror audiences... so the message is a bit garbled and the intended viewers are even more unclear.Also, ""Funny Games"" is a bit on the slow side, causing viewers to have a fair amount of patience with fairly little payoff. If you've seen ""Cache"", this is no surprise coming from the writer/director Michael Haneke. ""Cache"" is pretty much the slowest film ever made, causing this one to see rapid in comparison.For this film to work, the irony of a horror film critiquing horror films has to work. And I'm not sure that it does. The villain remarks that ""you shouldn't forget the importance of entertainment"", but the film isn't particularly entertaining... making me wonder if the director forgot the importance. The one entertaining part, involving the shotgun death of one of the captors, is presented as being a mistake. So, we are shown the importance of entertainment by being denied it? Or is this just telling us, subtle or not, that we enjoy the violence of films?Reviewer Warren Curry says this is a film that sends a ""message about the ills of a culture in which the media casually feeds hungry consumers violence"", which is true enough and points out that the film ""consciously doesn't offer the viewer a single voyeuristic thrill"". Where I think Curry is dead on the mark, though, is his contention that ""media depiction of violence is a topic that has been exhaustively analyzed at this point"" and that the film, therefore, ""seems unnecessary"". Indeed -- if the lesson was that violence sells, I don't think we learned anything new here.Curry is critical of the remake because it offers nothing new from the original, delivers an old message in a weaker voice and features actors playing the other actors rather than re-inventing the roles. As I haven't seen the original, I can't agree or disagree, but I would say that if the original was effective, why bother doing it again? Any serious film student has no objection to foreign, subtitled films and I think the general populace is beginning to accept foreign films on a growing scale. So why bother, Haneke? (Although, I do believe the remake received considerably more American press.)In conclusion, the film is a work of art. It looks great, and Haneke is amazing with the way he frames his shots. But it's not very entertaining and will annoy most horror fans. If the point of the film is to deny the viewer entertainment, you made your point... but you won't find yourself acquiring a happy audience. Personally, I was mixed, and see little or no reason to spend more time on the American version of this frustrating contradiction of a tale.",Funny Games
4,lee_eisenberg,Who wants to see violence?,7,20 June 2008,"Previously, I had seen Michael Haneke's movie ""Cache"" with Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil, and so I only knew of Haneke from that movie. It surprised me more than a little when, after watching ""Funny Games U.S."", I learned that it's a nearly shot-for-shot remake of an earlier movie by Haneke.When an affluent family arrives home after a vacation, two men come to the neighborhood. These guys look as if they just walked out of the typical exclusive sports club, and talk like straight-laced politicians. But when these two kindly take the family hostage and get them to follow every order, that's when the movie really takes off. Specifically, the movie plays with the audience. Showing brutality but carefully tempting us to want to see more, this is not the sort of thing that you usually see...if you truly desire to see it.As I've never seen the original version, I can't compare the two (although I do wonder what's up with remakes of foreign movies, even if it is from the same director). But I do recommend the film. It disturbingly forces us to think carefully about our society's obsession with violence, while never preaching or moralizing; hell, it actually takes a rather humorous approach. Starring Naomi Watts and Tim Roth.",Funny Games
5,jboothmillard,Funny Games US,6,18 July 2012,"I saw the original Austrian version that was listed as one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book, and American remakes of films like this are common, even with the same director, like The Grudge, so director Michael Haneke (Hidden (Caché) remakes his own film with this. Basically a wealthy family, parents Ann (Naomi Watts, also producing) and George (Tim Roth), their son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) and their dog are having a holiday in their lake house. While George and Georgie go sailing on the lake, and Ann is in the kitchen preparing dinner, young man Peter (Brady Corbet) has come round to apparently borrow some eggs for the neighbour. It appears that he innocently drops the eggs and needs some more, and then he is seen dropping the cellphone in the sink to dampen it, this frustrates her even more, and another young man Paul (Michael Pitt) arrives as well and increases the tension. George and Georgie come back at the point that Ann is demanding that they leave, they are refusing, and it is obvious that they are deliberately agitating them, and they trap them almost immediately after one is slapped. Peter and Paul hold the family captive in the lake house, and they perform violent acts of sadistic torture and humiliating games for their own amusement, with no real intention or reason. The first proof of their vicious intent was seen when the dog was found dead, and George's leg is broken by a golf club, and they decide to have a little bet, that by 9:00 the next morning the family may all be dead. Paul insults Peter during their violence, they do say that they have intruded other vacationing rich families before, apparently to get more money for their drug habit, but all in all their actions seem motiveless. Georgie attempts to escape by trudging through the near lake and running to the near houses, but he is soon caught by one of the young men, and the parents are distraught when they kill him, and seemingly leave the house. George tells Ann to get dressed, after she was undressed for humiliations, to run and find some help, while he tries to dry the damp cellphone and phone the police, but Peter and Paul come back to carry on their sick games. After a few more moments of the nasty activities, and killing George, the final scenes sees Paul and Peter take the tied up and gagged Ann in a boat on the lake, it is past 9:00, and they simply throw her in the water to drown, and they move on to another house to use the same method to get in and the whole thing will happen again. Also starring Boyd Gaines as Fred, Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Betsy, Robert LuPone as Robert, Susanna 'Susi' Haneke as Betsy's Sister-in-Law and Linda Moran as Eve. Corbet and Pitt look and seem exactly the same as the original actors and certainly make their characters mysterious and darkly mischievous, and Watts and Roth are suitable as the victims of the nasty foul play. It is a straight forward shot by shot remake, only the tiniest details have been changed, but they keep the scenes that made the original what it is, like the distinctive and clever remote control sequence, so I can't say one is better than the other, they seem equal, and this is still deliberately disturbing to watch, but a most watchable psychological horror thriller. Good!",Funny Games
6,rmax304823,Complete Rubbish.,1,25 January 2009,"A pair of queer young men invade the summer cottage of a middle-class couple. At first the two preppy-looking boys seem clumsy but apologetic and innocent. Then they turn rude, and finally violent, taking the husband (Tim Roth), the wife (Naomi Watts), and the child (Devon Gearhart) captives. They break Roth's leg, force Watts to strip off her dress and then bind her with tape, and mistreat the child. The teasing and mistreatment get worse. Attempts to escape or phone outside are thwarted. The plot has a self-conscious quality in that the two miscreants sometimes turn to the camera and make wisecracks or ask questions of the viewer.In the German original of ten years earlier, playing with the fourth wall was one of only two tries for originality. The other was that the two goons tortured the audience as well as the filmic family. Not only does the entire family wind up dead, but the boys explain the deaths to us this way -- they had to die because in a movie like this you weren't expecting them to. I didn't watch this to see if this remake is faithful enough to the original to senselessly kill the husband, wife, and child off.I can't imagine why the original was made, let alone why it had to be remade. The first half hour is engaging enough, focusing as it does on minor transgressions like dropping the four eggs you have just borrowed from a helpful neighbor, then dropping their replacements too, then politely refusing to leave when the family asks you to.But the rest is undiluted suspense and finally unmotivated horror. We don't know the two sadistic crazy boys. We identify with the bourgeois family -- and they're murdered, so we're denied the catharsis we've earned. And just because the movie makers think it's clever.It would be just as bad if the family members showed anger or defiance or any sign of stoicism, but they don't. They play it realistically, just as in the original. The terror and the pain seem real. There are moments when Naomi Watts runs around in her underwear so that we see her flawless figure, but it's anything but erotic because the suffering is abject. Her face is red and streaked with tears.It's a slasher movie for adults, if you want to put it that way, only this time it's not just the bad kids who die -- and the virgins don't get safely away. I've never understood the appeal of slasher movies. Who gets a kick out of seeing innocent people slaughtered? Who is this movie aimed at? Who is the audience?",Funny Games
7,BA_Harrison,Déjà vu.,7,22 February 2012,"Michael Haneke's 2007 version of Funny Games is so similar to his 1997 movie that I could save myself time and effort by simply copying my review for the original and pasting it here. I won't, though, because unlike Haneke, I would rather try a different approach than simply repeat myself verbatim.Instead, I am going to save myself a bit of time by keeping this review short and to the point.All the things that made the first film good are still present, as are all the things that made it less than perfect, Naomi Watts strips to her undies, and the remote control scene still doesn't work very well (God only knows what multiplex audiences expecting a straightforward horror/thriller made of that!).Since I gave the original film a rating of 6.5/10 (rounded up to 7 for IMDb), and this version is virtually identical, I guess I'll have to go with the same score.",Funny Games
8,Quinoa1984,"""Why are you doing this?""",4,14 March 2008,"Michael Haneke's remake of Funny Games is something else. It's less a game than it is something of a test, an experiment for the audience. Haneke made his original 1997 film (apparently, I haven't seen it, even though with one or two minor exceptions it's the same as this new 2008 refashioning) as a comment on what was an ""American phenomenon"" of movie violence. Or something. He's made his feature this time with stars- Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, even Michael Pitt as a sort of indie-star of the moment- so that it's not just some intellectual snobs going to see it in some dingy art-house dive in the Village. No, this time he's made a movie for the cineplex crowd, so that his pretentious intellectual exercise can be thrust upon an unsuspecting public who has been intrigued by the theatrical trailer (possibly, if one hasn't read online about the original or what the film really is about).It's about, in its essential ""genre"" terms (as ""genre"" Haneke would probably put in quotes first), a bourgeois family, mother-father-son, out for a weekend in their house along a sunny lake. There are also two preppy-looking kids, Peter and Paul (or Tom and Jerry or Beavis and Butt-Head, take your pick), one of whom stops by asking if he can borrow some eggs. They break (by fault of his own or not who cares). He asks for four more. They, too, break thanks to the family dog jumping on the lad. Things escalate. Father gets leg swiped by golf club. Now the game has begun, which is basically that they will kill the family by the end, or not.Intriguing premise? Sure. And Haneke, in a methodical style right from the start, shoots and edits like each shot should look out of Hopper or Rockwell; beautiful angles of a car driving, a happy family and then even into the early portion of the picture. But even from here there's a slight smugness to Haneke's hand as a director. 'Let's make it obvious, shall we?' could be his mantra, and this includes the long tried practice of a character (Pitt's specifically) who looks at the camera and speaks to the audience. Breaking the fourth wall, so daring! But I tried to stick with it, I really tried. It becomes clear after a short tick of time that Haneke is attempting to experiment, at mixing preachy lecture and sadistic killer flick ala Scream, and it doesn't connect, at all. In his go to present a self-conscious approach, he ends up talking down to the viewer with the message while ALSO making a sincere slasher picture with supposedly realistic connotations. It's an act of frustration, and not one that is entertaining, or successful as a piece of provocative fiction. If Haneke wants to build forward on the theory that violence is a horrible, ugly thing in movies, that's fine. And if we wants to make a thriller with some unconventionality to it, that's fine too. But in trying to combine the two, he falls flat on his face, condescendingly so.What it also boils down to, and this is a crucial point in my book (maybe not in others but in mine it is), is that for the most part he doesn't even make a lot of what he's presenting as the ""entertainment"" as entertaining. There are stretches in this film, practically static shots, where near nothing happens, and after the stretches the film doesn't recover, almost in spite of its exploitative rebound in the final reels. Aside from Haneke's penchant for tooling his audience into his own experiment group, where his pretension in his message shines through, he doesn't even make a horror film that has anything fresh or invigorating for said genre; practically all violence is off-screen, and it's not offensive or shocking like some critics have stated. It's only shocking in the sense that it's not as shocking as you might expect. If anything, there's an ambivalence to the violence as a self-conscious piece for the audience that shows Haneke not going all the way.A directorial flip-flopper, he wants to appeal to the base of fans he has over the Piano Teacher and Cache among others- many of which I've heard are great acts of genre subversion- and the adolescents who come in from the mall stores and the food court to give the thrills and spills of a genre piece. And, to compound this, the characters aren't halfway convincing, so it becomes less about feeling sympathetic or vengeful or (dare I say it) homicidal towards one group or another than about Haneke's pins for his theoretical bowling ball. Not even that simple conceit is allowed. In the end, it's a cinematic experience, but like those of the lessor Pasolini films (Salo would be the notorious example, but Teorema also comes to mind) and of course Godard's later works it doesn't follow through as a real tough act of satire or subversion but as something more trite and defective. If you already feel like you're proud of yourself for ""getting"" what Haneke's trying to deliver, without seeing if the Emperor has clothes or not, have at it, you'll have a good time. But for a large portion of the audience, it's almost slap in the face. 4.5/10",Funny Games
9,Coventry,Support ... Creativity?!?,4,8 April 2008,"You undoubtedly already noticed how each cinema screening opens with anti-piracy messages since the past couple of years. These messages urge and encourage the audience to support creativity instead of stealing it. I'm against movie piracy as much as the next guy, but it's quite ironic how they request us to support creativity whereas the filmmakers themselves don't even bother to be creative anymore! ""Funny Games US"" is an ideal example to back up this statement. Even Michael Haneke, a German writer/director who never ever disappointed me before, yielded for the temptation of making easy profits over inventing something new and refreshing. ""Funny Games US"" is a shot-by-shot remake of his own 1997 cult-shocker, also entitled ""Funny Games"", and I sincerely don't see the point in that. Honestly the reason can't only be to attract English audiences who refuse to read subtitles, because that's just pathetic. Of course, since the structure, plot and director in charge are identical, this remake isn't any better or any worse than the original. The concept of ""Funny Games"" is shocking and completely unpredictable, so when you're going to watch it for the first time  whether it's the Austrian version or the American one - you're in for a guaranteed surprise. The reverse is true, too. If you've seen the film once already, the shocks no longer have impact anymore and you'll only focus on the defects and shortcomings in the script. A model family arrives at the lakeside house for the annual vacation in which they sail and catch up with old friends. Before finishing unpacking properly, two twenty-something boys show up at the door and invite themselves in. In a polite way, they're being very obtrusive and they quickly turn out to be repellent psychopaths that kill and torture for no apparent reason. As in all of his films, Michael Haneke is only interested the darker sides of humanity, namely the nihilistic nature of rich teen kids and the role of the media in the portrayal of violence. Most of the film appears to be filmed in real-time but, there were it increased the intensity of the family's suffering during your personal first viewing, the incredibly long moments of dreadful emptiness and silence just seem plain boring. The performances are adequate, especially the ones coming from Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet as the youthful psychopaths. Naomi Watts is a beautiful lady but she hasn't got a lot to achieve here (except strip and cry a LOT) and good old Tim Roth urgently deserves a proper comeback with roles worthy of his talents.",Funny Games
10,michaelRokeefe,More than enough brutal fascination.,7,10 September 2008,"Austrian born director/writer Michael Haneke offers a remake of his 1997 breakthrough movie FUNNY GAMES. This stark and suspenseful thriller actually has characters facing the camera asking advice on rewinding events. Even asking viewers how they would bet on the outcome of planned behavior. At their lake shore vacation home, Ann(Naomi Watts), George(Tim Roth) and their son Georgie(Devon Gearhart)have unexpected visitors. What seems to be two mild mannered boys dressed in preppy sportswear come to the door with decadent thoughts in their heads. Asking to borrow four eggs gets one in the house. He drops the eggs before leaving and asks for four more. He comes back saying he dropped those as well and wants Ann's last four eggs. Very soon the politeness explodes into violence. Paul(Michael Pitt) and Peter(Brady Corbet) make the family their prisoners and force them into sadistic games...brutal, humiliating and sick. They make a bet with the vacationing family that all three of them will be dead in 24 hours. Watts and Pitt are excellent in their roles. Not exactly a lot of gore, but the suspense is good enough to raise some goose-bumps.",Funny Games
11,hitchcockthelegend,Pah,3,12 March 2009,"Michael Haneke directs this English language remake of his earlier German film about two white gloved, well spoken youthful psychopaths, who proceed to terrorise a waterside community. Apparently a deconstruction of media portrayals of violence and a look at how we respond to said portrayals, it's also immeasurably dull and smug beyond belief.I can just see the reams of Haneke worshippers jumping up and down and trying to vote a negative more than once on this comment, but you know what, if this comment goes 0 from 100 it will not make one ounce of difference to me, this is trite and smells of stale condensed milk. Haneke has done some excellent and challenging work, his 2001 film La Pianiste is an extraordinarily great picture, he is a director who, when on song and steering clear of being clever for clever's sake, is very watchable. But stuff like this just doesn't cut it at all, not needed and not even clever, I sometimes visualise Haneke sitting in a room and passing gas and proclaiming it as art, Funny Games U.S. has the same feel to it.3/10 for a smart turn from Michael Pitt and a bold attempt by Naomi Watts to carry the burden of this torpid rubbish.",Funny Games
12,Theo Robertson,Another Pointless Remake That Deserved To Flop,4,9 June 2013,"I do remember seeing the original version of Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES on channel 4 many years ago . It's a psychological horror thriller done in a very European low stated manner that gradually builds up tension to its downbeat conclusion . What makes it memorable is its temerity in bringing a meta-fictional aspect to its storytelling . Apart from that I doubt if it was a film that deserved to be remembered as any type of European classic film making . Critics often cite Haneke's as being "" cold cinema "" and it is true that there is a detached uninvolving air to the directors work and one that wouldn't translate well to an American setting and one wonders how the director could remake a very European film such as FUNNY GAMES for an American market ? The answer is that Haneke hasn't even tried . Like Gus Van Sant's remake of PSYCHO it's almost a shot for shot remake . In fact it's even more lazy than that because the remake of PSYCHO has a scene where Norman masturbates while he spys on his intended victim . Here Haneke doesn't change or embellish a single scene from his original work . You could give him a backhanded compliment by saying that there's no need to change anything in a film that is refreshingly meta-fictional but there's an irritating clash of styles where people speak in English with American accents in a film that feels entirely European with its long shot lengths and dialogue driven dramatics . In short it's a film produced in a European art house style for an American market that dooms the film to defeat",Funny Games
13,LeonLouisRicci,Blame the Filmmaker and the Audience,7,18 November 2016,"Sam Peckinpah took a Lot of Heat when He was Criticized for the Violence in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), when He said (paraphrasing) that He wanted to Show the Brutality and the Suffering and the Blood that Hollywood, up to that point, had Irresponsibly Avoided when Gunshots and other Obvious Assaults were Shown On Screen.Peckinpah was Accused of Faking Sincerity and made His Audience Wallow in the Carnage for Cutting-Edge Entertainment. Both Sam Peckinpah and His Critics were Correct.In this shot-for-shot Remake of His Own 1996 Movie, Writer/Director Haneke has had the Same Problem with His Detractors. Both Haneke and His Detractors are Correct.There's No Getting Around it. So You might Find this Movie Unbearable, Unnerving, Disturbing, and Pointless. It's Point is to Show the Decadence of Modern Movie Goers who Wallow in Ultra-Violence for Cheap Thrills. Haneke says that Violence isn't Cheap, it's Painful and Devastating to its Victims and We should be Ashamed.So should We be Ashamed at Watching, or Enjoying, or even Participating in this ""Preaching"" Anti-Violence Film while it Shoves Violence in Our Faces with a Hypnotic, Slow-Burn, Torturous and Relentlessly Unsettling Tone.We made the Choice to Watch After All, didn't We? So the Criticism Reverts to the Viewer and the Cycle Repeats Itself. Blame the Filmmaker...Blame the Patron...Blame the Filmmaker...Blame the Patron. Endlessly Pointless to Blame Either One, because Both are to Blame.Overall, Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, Michael Pitt, Brady Corbet, and Devon Gearhart all give Riveting Performances that Grip the Screen with Bravado and Won't Let Go, and along with the sometimes Very Dark Comedic Dialog, makes for a very Different Movie Experience Nobody is going to call ""Funny"".",Funny Games
14,poolandrews,Not really sure what to make of it.,5,23 January 2009,"Funny Games U.S. starts as husband & wife Ann (Naomi Watts) & George Farber (Tim Roth) & their young son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) arrive at their plush lakeside summer house for a vacation. As they unpack & sort themselves out a couple of young men named Paul (Michael Pitt) & Peter (Brady Corbet) turn up at the door asking to borrow some eggs, Ann agrees but she soon starts having her suspicions over the two rather oddly behaved men & ask's George to throw them out at which point they attack George breaking his leg with a golf club. The two then hold the terrified family hostage & both physically & mentally torture them as they bet that by the following morning all three members of the family will be dead...This American, French, English, Austrian, German & Italian co-production was written & directed by Michael Haneke & is in fact am almost shot-for-shot remake of his earlier film Funny Games (1997) just like Gus Van Sant did with Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) when he remade it in the late nineties, the one main & very obvious difference is that this time the film is set in the US rather than Austria & the film is shot in English so there's no need for those pesky subtitles. I will admit right now that I have never seen the original Funny Games & in fact I hadn't even heard of either the original or remake until I saw this last night so I cannot compare the two. In that regard I suppose I was going into Funny Games U.S. with a completely open mind & while I didn't exactly love it I didn't hate it either, in fact I would say I was right bang somewhere between the two extremes. There were parts of Funny Games U.S. which bored me to tears but then something would happen or someone would say something which rekindled my waining interest again & that happened for pretty much the entire duration. The story is pretty basic & doesn't stray from the central concept, I must admit I found the boyishly handsome & off putting polite Paul rather sinister & it's a shame we never really find anything out about him other than he's a psycho. The pace alternates between being very slow & very quick & it's oddly compelling & gripping at times although I think many will get bored by the end as the film doesn't seem to go anywhere. There's some odd moments as well which I didn't know what to make of, the part when Paul breaks the fourth wall & speaks to the audience is strange but not as strange as when he uses a remote control to rewind what has just happened & prevent his mate from being shot dead, a truly bizarre scene that seems so out of place I didn't know what to think.Apparently the makers used the original plans from Funny Games & built the house exactly the same size as in the earlier film. From a personal point of view I didn't think Funny Games U.S. was that violent or graphic & the majority of the violence takes place off-screen like the killing of the dog & young boy & George having his leg broken with a golf club. I think because of the mental torture the family is put through the thought of what is going on is worse than what is actually shown which is next to nothing. Being a shot for shot remake of a low budget Austrian film there's no need for any flashy CGI effects or extravagant camera angles or cosmetic beauty that a larger would would have afforded & it's all kept very simple yet effective.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 the budget wasn't huge by any means & it's well made with good production values throughout. Filmed in New York & on Long Island. The acting is good especially Michael Pitt as Paul who manages to slip between boyish charm & politeness to sadistic killer in a moment while Naomi Watts appears in her fourth horror film remake after Down (2001), The Ring (2002) & King Kong (2005).Funny Games U.S. is a film you can analyse all day long & it will probably mean different things to different people although I suspect most will just see it as a horror thriller, I thought overall it was alright but I wouldn't want to watch it again anytime soon.",Funny Games
15,dbborroughs,nasty-you'll either either love it or hate it,5,13 August 2008,"Michael Haneke's remake (apparently almost exact) of his earlier film called Funny Games about a pair of young men who terrorize a couple and their son on vacation. The point of the film is that violence is real and that movies are not as the family is battered abused and ultimately killed while the villains of the piece manipulate time and space, breaking the forth wall and manipulating things so that they ""win"" (Even to hitting a remotes rewind to go back in time).This is one of the nastiest and most sadistic films I've run across as the audience is abused as much as the characters on screen. Its a film that you are either going to love or hate. I dislike the film because I find it on some level intellectually dishonest. It is in its way essentially a slasher film or more correctly one of the current crop of torture porn films like Saw and Hostel, however its got higher aspirations by putting forward the notion that in reality people lose and that reality can't be manipulated.I think its the sort of movie that is painfully obvious in its themes and ideas especially to anyone who's actually thought about on screen violence, so much so that that I wonder why Haneke is putting it forward like a new thought. Its the sort of movie that resulted in my reacting with shock, boredom and a great big ""no duh"". It seems to be a non-exploitive exploitation film in that like films of old that showed drug use or violence or birthing babies ""so that people"" will know"" when they were really about making a buck (think Reefer Madness, Child Bride or Teenage Mother) Funny Games seems to be genuinely trying to put forth ideas so people will know with no hint of exploitation. Its also the sort of horror film that intellectuals will watch because of who the director is, assuming it has more to say then it really does. Of course they wouldn't watch Hostel or Saw film because there is no message, but since its Michael Haneke its okay. Its like going to an art gallery to see the nudes because its art instead of buying a copy of Hustler. As some people have written there is really no difference between the more recent Strangers where a trio of faceless people kill a couple except this film is more urbane and its slightly better made. The more honest of the two films for me is the Strangers since its not clouded by having to get its obvious message across.To be honest if one could strip the obvious meaning and tricks about reality way (which pulled me out of the film in a WTF way each time something happened) this would be a terrifying film. The pair of psychos are so cold blooded that they are truly terrifying (although one wonders why they haven't been caught- leaving a trail of rich white people generally is frowned upon). Haneke has really made a film that at its core is a classic horror film, its just too thoughtful for its own damn good. (Actually its so much a mirror of horror films that it is pretty much a clichéd exercise with scenes playing out close to how I imagined they would and an ending that was clear to anyone who's seen enough of the films its aping.)

16,Bunuel1976,"FUNNY GAMES (Michael Haneke, 2007) **",4,23 July 2008,"I had watched Haneke's own original Austrian version of this made ten years earlier; since it's been some time from that sole viewing, I don't recall exactly what my opinion of the film had been  but it was certainly more favorable than that of its totally unnecessary Americanization! With this in mind, I can't really tell whether the new version has made changes to the earlier film's narrative; I'm not sure, for instance, whether the gimmicks found here (Michael Pitt's asides to the audience or his 'rewrite' of the plot towards the end) were also a part of the 1997 original.Anyway, Haneke is hardly the first director to have remade his own work  but the result, in this case, is easily among the most superfluous I've come across. While the entire cast performs as if convinced it's involved in the creation of something special, this feeling isn't shared by the audience (at least, not this viewer); the fault lies with the inherent artificiality of Haneke's concept and the resultant stiff acting by talented actors (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth) who are well capable of much better things. One doesn't question the possibility that such acts of senseless violence can happen  but, judging strictly by what is depicted here, it's hard to swallow the fact that the couple (whom we're given the impression are fairly intelligent) would allow two obnoxious baby-faced brats to terrorize them for the length of time they do without giving them a fair fight (even if the husband is as wimpy as they come and gets immobilized with just one golf club smack to boot, and the action is confined for a considerable stretch of the duration to a single room).In the long run, anyone not familiar with the original or the director's work in general  to say nothing of some conservative viewer drawn merely by the star presences and expecting a mainstream thriller  might well be shocked by Haneke's casual attitude to violence and especially death; however, neither will they be spared the boredom of his pointless extended takes from a fixed camera position!",Funny Games
17,zardoz-13,Squeamish Audiences Should Avoid This Contrived Home Invasion Thriller,7,31 August 2013,"Nothing about ""Funny Games"" is remotely amusing. Mind you, this isn't a comedy. Instead, this pretentious home invasion thriller unfolds with a sinister air of intrigue and then resorts to surreal contrivance. Once the contrivance has taken hold, the film stumbles, breaks the fourth wall—addressing us in the audience rather than ignoring us—and degenerates into a thoroughly unsavory opus with an unhappy ending. George Faber (Tim Roth) and his wife Anna(Naomi Watts) are a married couple who have gone on vacation with their young son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) to sail their boat. The last thing that they imagined would happen occurs when two nice-looking, twenty-something guys decked out in white outfits, wearing white gloves (blaming eczema), invade their house, take them hostage, and torture them before they eventually kill them. Initially, the assailants do not wield firearms. Instead, they use a golf club and then later on a shotgun that they take from one of the occupants. The titular ""Funny Games"" turn out to be mental guessing games. Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Bradley Corbet) are the immaculate young gentlemen who make the last days of the Faber family anything but humorous. While this grizzly epic generates suspense from the outset, writer & director Michael Haneke blows it with asides from the villains. Meaning, one of the villains looks at the camera and converses with the audience as if he knew where we were. Later, a villain lays his hands on a VCR remote control and rewinds the action after something tragic happens to him.Primarily, Haneke has remade his 1997 original so he could reach a larger audience. The performances are terrific, and the young fellows who terrorize the family with impunity are dynamite. Rarely do they raise their voices during their confrontations with the Fabers. Things go off the rail when these low-key maniacs murder the son with a shotgun. Haneke saturates ""Funny Games"" with irony. He has made a movie about relentless violence, but he doesn't pander to his audience with histrionic scenes of blood and gore. We are shown little in the way of violence. We can hear the violence off-camera, but we are denied the opportunity to see it depicted. Haneke struggles to defy our expectations, and the surprises often hit their mark. For example, the villains kill a dog. This act of violence would have earmarked them for death in a standard-issue home invasion melodrama. Ultimately, this polished chiller emerges as an exercise in nihilism. The villains drown Anna after they have killed her husband, and they go on to the next group of victims. Actually, ""Funny Games"" goes in a kind of circle. The Farbers meet Peter and Paul (who often refer to themselves by different names) when their next door neighbor Fred brings one of them over to introduce them to George. These psychopaths like to use the story that the previous couple with whom they are staying requires some eggs. ""Funny Games"" qualifies as above-average, with superb acting, but the narrative tries t0 be a little too smart for its good.",Funny Games
18,grantss,Not anywhere near as good as the original,3,28 October 2017,"The original Funny Games - German, made in 1997, written and directed by Michael Haneke - was great. Haneke decided to remake the movie for US audiences, and promptly screwed it up. Instead of thought- provoking, this is pretentious. Instead of innovative, this is second hand. Instead of suspenseful, this is boring. Maybe it was because I had seen the original so knew where it was going, but the plot was slow. Direction was ponderous and listless.Worst of all was the casting. Michael Pitt spells disaster for any movie he is in. Wooden, pretentious, irritating. Brady Corbet follows his lead.

This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I loathed every minute of it. That was torture enough! To have to describe every creepy nasty moment is a disservice to those who want their entertainment just that : entertaining.All I can say is I hated his other 'acclaimed' film CACHE and this just makes me hate Haneke even more; I won't be fooled again when he has his next project unleashed into theaters; neither should you!",Funny Games
20,ferguson-6,You gotta break a few eggs ...,8,15 March 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. For years I have recommended director Michael Haneke's 1997 German version as a sleeper in the creepy, psychological thriller genre. This time Haneke (""Cache"") recreates the film in English, scene by scene, in an attempt to reach a wider audience. And when I say ""reach"", I really mean reach into your head and make you question your outlook! Although I haven't seen the original in a few years, I believe this is a shot by shot remake with well respected actors Tim Roth and Naomi Watts in the leads. The two well-mannered psychos are played here by Brady Corbett and a chilling Michael Pitt (""The Village"", ""Last Days""). Watts and Pitt really make this film work. It is very difficult to watch at times as it reminds us that the worst evil has no conscience. And most of us can't help but put ourselves in the shoes of the ""normal"" victims. How would we react? What would we do differently? How could they let this happen to themselves? As a husband and father, Roth's helplessness is torturous.The best part of this film is listening to the debate going on inside your own head as you watch. Haneke provides so many subtle moments and even adds to the horror by never actually showing any of the killings. The offscreen sounds and moreso, the faces and reactions of the actors tell us more than we want to know. Haneke is renowned for his Opera productions and one can't help but notice the similarities here.Two particular scenes really stand out for me. The opening sequence filmed alternately from above and in the cab of the vehicle complete with a foreshadowing duel between classical music and Marilyn Manson; and the long take of Naomi Watts struggling to get free after the boys first leave the house. Both are unsettling and amazing.",Funny Games
21,gradyharp,"'Funny' as in 'Strange', NOT as in 'Ha-Ha'",3,15 June 2008,"FUNNY GAMES is Michael Haneke's English language remake of his own German success from 1997 by the same name. While is takes some interesting twist and turns as far as technique of film-making goes, the story lies somewhere between repulsive and prolonged boring, and is not a film this viewer would watch again. We first meet Ann (Naomi Watts), husband George (Tim Roth), and son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) as they drive to their vacation spot playing games of guessing arias and opera singer identities from CDs in their car. But immediately on arriving to their lakeside home they are visited by a strange young lad Peter (Brady Corbet) who asks to borrow eggs for their next-door neighbor. Soon Peter's mishaps are magnified when his friend Paul (Michael Pitt) joins him in a rather preposterous game of arguing over trite situations that result in Peter and Paul (malignantly sterile in appearance in white shorts and shirts and gloves) moving into the 'funny games ' that are aimed at total destruction of Ann, George and Georgie. It is not funny, it is not credible, and yes, it does become annoying in the manner in which the writing for Ann and George makes them into fools for going along with the 'games' as long as they do. Watts and Roth are wasted in this film but Pitt and Corbet manage performances that kick us in the gut - as these oily creatures are meant to do. Not a film to be recommended for general viewing, but one that will please those who love the torture genre. Grady Harp,",Funny Games

23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Funny Games U.S.,7,20 April 2008,"The next remake however, is an almost shot-for-shot, scene for scene treatment of Michael Haneke's own film back in 1997, now suffixed with U.S. in acknowledging the new funding and new cast that come to be in the movie. However, I question the real rationale why this would be remade for the modern audience, as the original seems like it's able to withstand the annals of time.Of course having films remade this way is nothing new, with Gus Van Sant doing the same with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, but at least it had someone else at the helm, probably wanting to challenge himself if his retelling, only with a change in case and everything else ceteris paribus, would be able to evoke the same emotional, horrific response. But I couldn't really understand a director remaking his own works, and a scene for scene one at that, except to perhaps work with a different cast in a different country.Naomi Watts headlines the movie, and together with Tim Roth, they form the couple Ann and George, who with their kid Georgie (Devon Gearhart), are off for a vacation in their home away from home, and as the story goes, things start to get really strange when they begin to encounter the duo Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet), dressed in white and in gloves, behaving quite strangely outside of social norms, and adamant in playing games as they soon find themselves captives under the hands of sociopaths.While Haneke's intention of the original movie was to highlight the notion of senseless violence, I felt that having this remake done, is to bait folks like me who are back, curious to find out more, the second time round, despite being told that it's exactly the same. Like masochists who revisit their pain points, I too fall under this group of the curious, and again find myself being questioned on whose side am I on, and whether I'd begin to advocate violence against violence, as the only way to solve the issue at hand.While Naomi Watts can play terrified, likely honed from her scream queen stint from King Kong, Michael Pitt deserves mention as the chillingly cold villain, and managed to equal Amo Frisch's performance of the same character in the original. Other than that, Tim Roth's character as usual is wasted, because his potential threat level has been reduced, and Brady Corbet as the partner also managed to equal Frank Giering of the original, though of course being more of a sidekick to Paul.If one should recommend which version to go for, I'd say you can go for either or. But if you had already watched the original, then you might want to give this a skip as it doesn't offer any other new insights, since after all, it's the same story, development and finale, even right down to the heavy rock soundtrack used.",Funny Games
24,lasttimeisaw,The original is a nefarious succès-de-scandale but its US remake is a bespoke commodity speaks volumes of Haneke's faintly veiled intention,7,25 December 2017,"A double-bill of Michael Haneke's notoriously provocative home-invasion thriller FUNNY GAMES, its original version and the US shot-by-shot remake made a decade later with a different cast, they are basically the same film, the only noticeable revision is a landline telephone would be plausibly upgraded to a cellphone. Affixing death metal to high-brow classical music, FUNNY GAMES alerts us from the beginning of its irreconcilably conflicting parties in this game of torture and murder: the bourgeois nuclear family (emblazoned by their lakeside holiday residence and a private boat) versus two white-gloves-sporting, acedia-afflicted young psychopaths (whose backgrounds are completely in the shadows). It is very interesting to watch how genteel etiquette disintegrates into hostility on a moment's notice, and how it becomes a fortune to hostage if one is that prone to irritability yet not cautious enough to the consequences, although what is blatantly shocking is the want of clear motive behind these two amoral young men, who wallow in inflicting sadism and cruelty to innocent people, and are dangerously masked by a normal and friendly appearance. But after watching the same story twice (not recommended though), a viewer may sense something perniciously self-serving in the scene nearly the beginning, the couple can be cautioned by their friend (aka. the previous hostage), a warning out of desperation might not be a game-changer to overcome the perpetrators (who are in possession of a rifle), but at least, they can try to fight back and very likely break the vicious circleAlso one can second-guess that in lieu of complete resignation, the wife could have shown some bravura by jumping onto their neighbor's departing boat in the eleventh hour only if she knew it would be her last chance. To mitigate the ill-feeling stemmed from audience's emotional investment of the beleaguered family, Haneke opts for a novel schtick by allowing one of the young wrongdoer Paul (Frisch/Pitt) to occasionally break the 4th wall and even play God with a remote control when an unpremeditated accident croaking his companion, archly takes audience away from their heinous act and nattering hogwash, renders a refreshing sensation of levity, which is a crying reprieve at that point of the narrative (after sending both a dog and a child to meet their makers out of Haneke's convention-defying obduracy). The film is violent no doubt, but mercifully we are spared from witnessing direct simulation of killing save its grisly aftermath, and it is fire and brimstone for the two leads, in the earlier version, the late Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Mühe (who became a couple in real life after making this film) stupendously put themselves through the wringer of distress, terror and despair, command onerous brawn against physical hindrance (including in a challenging long take lasting more than ten minutes), and Lothar notably drains all her energy into a traumatized state that's too disturbing to look twice. The same impression is ineluctably blunted in the remake, due to the vanishing thrill of reiteration, nevertheless Naomi Watts, undergoes the same ordeal with equally gutsy virtuosity but less apparel.On the villain parts, a wide-eyed Michael Pitt totally and literally pales in comparison with Arno Frisch, whose bumptious self-assurance is simultaneously gnawing and sinister, whereas Frank Giering and Brady Corbet both make a good accomplice who is unpleasantly effete and morbidly creepy. Teasing with the line between reality and fiction, the sick underside of human frailties often overlooked by the prim and the proper, Haneke's succès-de-scandale is not for faint-hearted but an anglophone remake made in facsimile betrays his eagerness to unleash the bane on those subtitle-eschewing English-speaking Americans, a bespoke commodity speaks volumes of his faintly veiled intention.",Funny Games
25,sddavis63,The Biggest Problem With This Movie Is That The High Point Comes Way Too Early,6,20 July 2019,"The first half of this movie, I thought, was quite good. The story begins with Ann and George and their son going to their high class summer home on the lake. Immediately things are off. They see their neighbour in the company of two young men who just don't seem to fit. Something isn't right, but what. Neighbour Fred explains that they're the sons of a business associate of his - but there's something off. The look on his face as he's telling the story. As it turns out, the young men are a couple of psychopaths terrorizing the area, going from house to house, torturing and killing people for little discernible reason except that they liked to torture and kill people. The movie starts rather slowly, but that first half has a very good escalation of the suspense, and Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet were superb as the young psychos Paul and Peter. The characters seemed to fit into the environment. They came across as the stereotypical entitled rich kids who think they can do anything and get away with anything for the sake of their own amusement. Pitt and Corbet captured the essential creepiness of the characters and at the same time gave them this upper class feel. Those performances were superb. Naomi Rapace and Tim Roth, on the other hand (as the terrorized couple Ann and George) lacked something - that magical quality between actors known as chemistry seemed to me to be lacking between them. Their individual performances were all right (Rapace, I thought, was better) but they just didn't work as a couple. They didn't look like a couple; they didn't feel like a couple. But that first half was a pretty good and suspenseful time.After that, though, things fell apart a little bit. The ""climax"" of the movie (the killing of young George) came at that point. That left me wondering - where do you go from here? Where was this going. As shock value, young George's death worked - you don't really expect the kid to be killed in this kind of movie - but you couldn't go upward in terms of shock value at that point. To me, the rest of the movie seemed to de-escalate from that point. And when the high point of a movie is halfway through, you actually do have a problem.There's also no real closure to be found here. There was no real reason for the violence; no explanation of why the young men did what they did. Sure - I get the point I made earlier. They were a couple of psychopaths who did what they did because they liked it, but personally I prefer a little more psychological depth to a movie like this; more of an explanation of what's in the mind of the killers. That's completely lacking. There's a bizarre sequence toward the end of the movie when things don't go right for the pair of killers - and so one of them grabs a TV remote control and rewinds the movie so that the scene can be played out again with a different ending. That lost me. I didn't get the point of that at all. And the ending simply seems to make the point that the torture and killing spree will go on and on as the pair move from house to house. No explanation; no closure; no consequences. The last half of the movie left me pretty dry, to be honest.Overall this is a decent movie. It's a little hard to watch in places although there's surprisingly little of what I would call graphic violence or explicit torture. The story is quite good up to that halfway point, and then starts to fizzle the rest of the way. I'd give the movie as a whole 6/10.",Funny Games
26,Buddy-51,deeply disturbing art horror film but definitely not for everyone,8,20 December 2008,"Watching ""Funny Games"" is a bit like coming across a major accident on the highway - you know you should continue driving on past the scene, but you just can't keep yourself from slowing down and gawking at all the wreckage.The premise of the story does not sound very promising at first, as the idea, or a simple variation of it, has served as the foundation for countless such films in the past: an innocent family of three is held hostage in their home by a couple of sadistic killers who systematically abuse and terrorize their victims for their own twisted pleasure.So many horror movies are predictable and formulaic that it's a pleasant surprise to come across one that actually makes an effort to break free of its bonds and make its own way in the world. And, indeed, ""Funny Games"" busts through the horror movie conventions with an almost ruthless determination. In this Americanized version of a film he made in his native Austria in 1997, director Michael Haneke scrupulously avoids obvious camera setups and editing techniques, bypassing virtually every storytelling, visual or audio cliché endemic to the genre. There is no background music, for instance, to cue us into the scary moments, no screeching cats jumping out of the shadows, and no point-of-view shots designed to generate easy suspense. Unlike in most films of this type, the violence here happens in an entirely haphazard and random manner, making it all the more frightening in its unpredictability and plausibility. Haneke refuses to cater to the expectations of his audience, making them face the reality of the nightmare he's showing them rather than giving them what it is they may want to see.Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet are cringe-worthy and terminally creepy as the smarmy psychopaths who get their jollies out of watching other people suffer, while Naomi Watts, Tim Roth and Devon Gearhart engage our full sympathy as the hapless victims who have come up against the blank wall of two twisted minds they are woefully unequipped to even understand, let alone wage battle against.This is one of the most memorable and artful horror films of recent times, but it is also one of the most unnerving and difficult to watch. The movie gets into your bones, no matter how much your better angels may be telling you to keep it out. It's depressing and disturbing and is certainly not intended for all audiences, but it is a movie that it is very difficult to shake off once you've given yourself over to it.",Funny Games

28,MOscarbradley,A perfect 'remake',9,24 June 2008,"However skeptical you might be at Michael Haneke's decision to remake his own earlier masterpiece for the American market, or rather in America for a presumably wider, international audience, there is no denying that it 'works'. Perhaps Haneke simply didn't want anyone else messing about with his work, though choosing to do an almost frame-by-frame remake seems odd, particularly after the disaster of Gus Van Sant's treatment of ""Psycho"".Audiences familiar with the original may spend too much time looking for differences and I admit I am sure the film's crucial mid-point scene, (so appallingly effective in the original it has haunted me ever since), seems here to be slightly altered, though not by much, and marginally less effective. (I may be wrong and need to check the first version out again). You may also question the need to do it at all, even if it is done as well as it is here, but then I suppose that is like saying that remakes of any kind and by anyone are redundant or that classic plays are not open to re-interpretation on the stage when clearly this is not the case. Indeed in moving 'the action' to America Haneke may be seen as adding to the debate on violence in that particularly violent country and in reaching out to a hopefully wider audience, to the debate on screen violence generally.For those who don't know the plot, it's about a family tortured in their summer home by two well-dressed, mostly polite and seemingly very well educated young men for no apparent reason other than they can do it; that they can exercise this terrible power over these people. Getting away with it doesn't seem to be an issue. (In some respects comparisons with the Leopold/Loeb case will be drawn). But equally it could be argued that Haneke isn't aiming for 'reality' at all. He makes it plain enough that we are only watching a movie, albeit a particularly horrible one, with devices such as the characters addressing the audience, (in relation to how we feel about what we are watching), and audaciously by reversing the action at one point. In this way he makes us complicit in what is happening. After all, we, unlike the family on screen, can always get up and leave. The performances too, particularly by Naomi Watts as the terrorized wife and mother and Michael Pitt as one of the young 'terrorists', are superb.",Funny Games
29,bowmanblue,Reviewed after second viewing,7,20 December 2014,"I first watched Funny Games (US) and enjoyed it (well, thought it was a film I'd like to watch again), so I bought it. However, half way through a second viewing, I decided I couldn't take any more and turned it off.Some may say that's a sure sign that it's a bad movie. They may be right - even its star Tim Roth has since refused to watch it. The film is actually an American version (filmed shot for shot) of an Austrian 'home invasion' movie and is supposed to be about 'the nature of violence.' I didn't know this when I first watched it and just looked at it as a horrific film which was deliberately quirky.It's about a family who get held hostage in their own (holiday) home by two nasty - yet annoyingly polite - young psychopaths. The first time I watched it I stuck with it and thought it was interesting/different enough to warrant a second viewing. I guess the reason I turned it off is because it was just too frustrating to watch. I practically wanted to jump into the TV armed with a chainsaw and... well, I won't give too much away.If you don't know about the film, I won't spoil the 'weirder' bits. It's definitely not a horror film, as there isn't much blood and gore (what there is happens off screen). It's more an experience in frustration making statements about the audience's desire to witness blood and gore on the big screen. Now, some may say that's a bit pretentious and, if you feel this way, this film probably isn't for you.If you want to watch this - be prepared for the least 'feel good' film ever made. It's not a horror and it's not a thriller. It's simply an exercise in watching.

That should have been left out.The film starts out with a family on their way to their vacation home. They are listening to classical music and all of a sudden punk rock starts blaring. Cool.They pass their neighbors and say hi, there are 2 guys with them whom they say are friends. Soon, one of the guys comes over to borrow eggs. Before long, things get out of hand. It turns out the 2 guys are very polite psycho paths. They use mind games to torture the family and finally end up with a gun.

32,Bored_Dragon,Funny Games (1997. i 2007.) - Remote control?! Really?!,7,28 January 2018,"I'm a great fan of Naomi Watts, so when I saw Funny Games from 1997, I could not resist watching a remake immediately. After a few minutes, I realized that this is not a classic remake, but literally to the detail the same movie, only shot at another location and with the other set of actors. Ok, they've changed dog breed and cell phone and kitchen appliances are more modern, but everything else is identical. Every scene, every cadre, every word. I do not understand why Haneke had the need to do something like this, without even trying to bring at least a little original spirit into this remake. After fifteen minutes I got bored, so , out of love for Naomi, I just skipped to the key points and watched the most important scenes. At first I was sorry I did not watch the remake first, because of Naomi of course, but I soon discovered that I did not make a mistake because the original is somewhat better.Funny Games is a psychological thriller/horror, which shows the family on vacation in the middle of nowhere. A couple of young sociopaths break into their house and start a psycho-physical terror. Story is solid, with no big holes and illogicality, and shows the situation very realistically. The directing is excellent and manages to build an extremely stressful atmosphere completely without explicit scenes, with this tension somewhat stronger in the original. As far as acting is concerned, it's hard to say which cast is better overall. Although Michael Pitt is really creepy, Arno Frisch and Frank Giering are much better in roles of young sociopaths. On the other hand, Naomi Watts is slightly better Anna than Susanne Lothar, while Tim Rot completely overshadows Ulrich Mühe from the very start.!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!All in all, this more than a solid thriller, with a strong atmosphere that kept me on the edge of the seat, would have earned a strong eight, maybe even nine, if Haneke did not come to a totally moronic idea to add a ""fourth dimension"", i.e. direct communication with the audience. On several occasions we have freezing of the image, actors talking to the audience, and on top of everything, one of the characters takes the remote control in the middle of denouement, rewinds the movie few minutes back, and then movie takes completely different direction. This kind of scene is suitable only and exclusively in comedies, and even there it's outworn, but for a serious psychological thriller it is a complete deal-breaker and spoils overall impression to seven tops. Due to a certain difference in the atmosphere of the original and the remake, I give them half a score up and down.1997. - 7,5/10
2007. - 6,5/10Arno & Frank - 8/10
Naomi & Tim - 9/10",Funny Games
33,ironhorse_iv,This film isn't fun to watch. It was too much of a shot by shot remake film. The original film use the concept better.,6,8 October 2015,"2007's Funny Games has the same problems as 1998's Psycho. Both were, shot for short remakes, of better films. While, 1998's Psycho was directed by a different director; 2007's Funny Games had the same one. Director Michael Haneke, pretty much, just copy and paste, his original foreign language film, here. He didn't add anything new to the movie. While, the film might seem, very innovation to those, who didn't see the original 1997 Austrian film. For those, who did, there was little to anything, worth seeing in the remake. Frankly, that's pretty disappointing. Anyways, both films center on the same plot. A rich family, George (Tim Roth) and Ann Farber (Naomi Watts), and their pre-teen son Georgie (Devon Gearhart), at their lakeside vacation house, only to find themselves, being taken hostage, by two clean-cut young men, Paul (Michael Pitt) & Peter (Brady Corbet) wearing white gloves. It soon becomes very clear that the two men are psychopaths who intend to torment the family with a number of cruel painful games before murdering them. Can the family survive their ordeal or will the murderers get their way with them? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the English-language version has mostly the same themes as the German version. The film frequently blurs the line between fiction and reality, especially when it comes to the common horror plot structure. Often, one of the killers would makes references to the formulaic suspense rules of traditional cinema throughout the film. Paul is more likely to do this. He would often highlight, the act of observation by the viewer, by breaking the fourth wall, to address questions on how the film should move on; should they follow the standard path or should they break the rules. This Meta style is the reason, why I chose to watch the original, because it sound pretty interesting and wasn't predictable. I like, how they broke, the concepts of red herring, and final girl with an over the top Diabolus Ex Machina moment. However, seeing it, again, in this remake, felt like rehash. It was very predictable, so it didn't shock me as it did the first time. I knew, it was going to be a downer ending. I knew that the film will have those random awkward static long drawn shots of nothing. I knew the acting wasn't going to be the greatest, with those long drone-like monotone voices. I knew that the music from avant-garde music group, Naked City will be loud, and annoying in this film. Last, I knew the movie was going to have those big goofs, like when Paul try to ""rewinds"" the film, he presses the Volume Down (-) button on the remote control instead. So what's left to for, to look forward to rewatching? Utterly nothing. The psychological mind trip has gotta old and stale. It's really hard to watch, once you know, that the entire film is essentially an insulting trolling prank from the creators, to its viewers. I think, the only reason, why this movie was remade; was to troll the trolls. I know, that the director wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless film, but what the price of making a social commentary statement film, when it comes to the terms of entertainment. Can the intentional tediousness of boring scenes enhances the realism of the movie to the point, that people would see, the film as it is, brilliant mockery? Sadly, not. Just, because you able to push a brutal honestly anti-violence message; doesn't mean, people want to hear it or see it. Still, I do like Haneke's taste in depicting, acts of violence, largely off-screen. However, he still sounds like a hypocrite for even, making a film like this. The film, general, over the top-preachy nature is a bit too jarring for people to take in. Very inflammatory. Even, those, who partake in the film process, have later, openly admit, how much, they hate, working of the project. Tim Roth has said making this film, kinda abused him, and he'll never watch again. He said he was particularly disturbed because Devon Gearhart resembled his own son. Naomi Watts told people, while, she always be a little drawn to the darker stuff, that she often felt that the role was little too uncomfortable for her taste. Overall: While the film discussion about the fragile and illusory sense of reality caused by the representational nature of fictional imagery is intriguing. The film's argument that violence in horror films do cause violence in general is quite underdeveloped. However, the most controversial call to the artifice of the movie is probably the remote-control scene, which will divide the audience, so much, that they might hate the film, or love it. No matter, what other people think of the film. I do like how it takes Rene Magritte's painting ""The Treachery of Images"" to a new extreme. Like, how Rene Magritte states that the pipe is not a pipe. In my opinion, this movie is not much of a movie. Recommended watching the original, not so much for the bland remake.",Funny Games
34,johnnyboyz,"Peculiar little film that attempts to turn horror into art and the tables on people out for passive, mind-numbing gore-fest features.",6,20 March 2009,"While I hate to say it, I am on the fence with Funny Games U.S., a shot for shot (or so I'm told) remake of the same director's 1997 film of the same title. There is a definite style to Michael Haneke's work here, something that has been planned, thought through and then executed in a particular manner. This is not a daft, brainless gore-fest in which the emphasis is on the blood and the guts rather than it is the crux of the situation itself or the 'getting to' that particular point. No, this is all about tempo and build up and suspense before any violence that does occur, is a result of direct actions or reactions on one or more character's behalf. For this, it's easy to commend Funny Games U.S., a film that few will commend but it feels distinctly wrong to talk it up too much.The set up is quite ingenious, that being the set up before the film has even begun, seeing Michael Haneke applying artistic traits to a straight up torture-come-horror film and releasing it to a mainstream audience complete with their favourite stars on a modest budget of fifteen million dollars. But wait a minute; when was the last time you saw a horror film as accessible as this one with several long takes lasting minutes and minutes? When was the last time you saw a horror film this accessible to include scenes seemingly revolving around nothing as both content and character actions focused more on the everyday things in life rather than out and out cause and effect driven dialogue and behaviour? I'm not sure there are many.By gathering funding from several different Italian, German, British and French companies respectively and casting Tim Roth and Naomi Watts whilst taking influence from a couple of other horror films and applying his own style, Haneke has created a beast and placed it within the mainstream but with very obscure camera, editing and pacing techniques under a facade of a cast most will flock to see in a movie placed within a definitive genre.One of my early presumptions was that this had been remade purely to make money off the back of the 'Saw' franchise successes. The fact he did it shot for shot required no new ingenuity for the project and, maybe, it existed purely as a cash-cow. Also, the constant reference to 'playing games' will remind you of the franchise. But, I think I was slightly wrong in assuming this and the goal of bringing horror and despicable violence to the mainstream in an entirely different manner was more the goal here - if anything this is the anti-Saw film. This is the more unbearable piece that has you wince and look away at the overall situation more than it does the gratuity; whereas a Saw sequel would rather you dive for cover at the sight of gore as you happily, maybe passively, sit and stare as all the talk and what-not is carried out in-between the 'trap' scenes.But Haneke also draws on influence from survival horror to deliver his piece, even including the customary break out by the lone female 'innocent' as she desperately runs for help through numerous locations adding to dramatic tension  think recent efforts Wolf Creek or Severance. The post-modern and quite exquisite locale of Ann (Watts) and George's (Roth) lake house complete with just about everything from huge garden to sensor on the front gate acts as a luxurious but very juxtaposed place for nasty events in which to be carried out. This isn't a grimy dungeon and this isn't someone's basement or a cramped forest or a network of caves, it is a million dollar house that acts as a playground for terror.The film is constructed around a series of 'games' that two mysterious men dressed in white named Paul (Pitt) and Peter (Corbet) play with the family after they seductively and nauseatingly con their way into the house by coming across as friendly through asking for eggs and to borrow a golf club. The camera-work is important here, remaining static and on certain subjects for a long while as agonising situations are played out; the first 'game' of which is linked to the family's pet dog and that is particularly harrowing while sets the tone for things to come. There is a sense of surveillance in the camera-work, a certain sense that the camera is entrenched in a certain position for our watching on benefit and this follows on from the breaking of the fourth wall Paul does very early on when he states to us that we get to watch the 'bet' that the family will be dead by the morning play out.A couple other points are limited to the fact Naomi Watts acts as the executive producer, which I'm pretty sure equates to the fact she's actually paying for her own global, on-screen humiliation given the things that happen to her in the film. The daft manner in which then parents allow their child on a boat or jetty near deep water without a life jacket and to allow him to carry a kitchen knife from house to yacht pays homage to the nasty and probable doom-impending scenarios that will be played out later on. While many will label this a love/hate film for reasons varying from the fact it's slow in its long takes to the grotesque content to the fact it's a brilliant film that studies what the audience enjoys out of on screen violence, it is difficult to commend the film for anything more than the slight experiment it is: a piece aimed at people who 'enjoy' all those gratuitous horror films, which isn't me.",Funny Games
35,insomniac_rod,Not shocking or hard to watch. It's simply a rather mediocre attempt to shock the audience.,5,22 June 2009,"I didn't plan to watch this movie; in fact, when it was scheduled on HBO, I though it was the original version.I decided to give it a chance mainly because I'm in lust with Naomi Watts and I think Tim Roth is a great actor.When the events started to get form, I mean, when the two baby face criminals took the family as hostages, my expectations went down to the point that I asked ""is this a joke?"", ""the movie is absurd, inept"".I mean, the acting is pretty good by Naomi and Tim, even the kid is a very good actor but the two villains were annoying and not believable. I mean, how could these two torture an entire family? Both kids just needed a kick in the balls and nothing more! The so-called torture was just hard to believe and it even felt awkward. The violence is not graphic at all and most of the situations are just boring. The direction in my opinion tried to look very artsy or clever but it just got on my nerves because in many scenes most of the tension was ""on hold"" because the camera just didn't show anything.The cinematography is actually pretty good; it's bright and at some points gives the sad vibe when things get ugly.The message of the movie is very clear and that's where the movie triumphs.I could only recommend it for fans of the new wave of torture-crime cinema. Otherwise, please avoid it. And I love Naomi Watts!",Funny Games
36,meeza,No Funny Business here!,6,27 August 2008,"There is nothing remotely funny about Director Michael Haneke's suspense thriller ""Funny Games"". Haneke had previously played this game before by directing a dead-ringer original ""Funny Games"" German version back in 1997. The 2007 American ""Funny Games"" version is a sadistic tale of two sinister 20 year old preppies who take a family hostage in their vacation cabin. Haneke's primary vision quest of ""Funny Games"" is to inform his target audience on society's obsession with being entertained with violence and masochistic happenings. The torturous acts that the film's antagonists prey on their victims are not easy to watch and are freakily exaggerated to the point of absurdness. I did think that Tim Roth and Naomi Watts had their acting game on as the victimized couple George & Ann. However, Michael Pitt and Brady Corbert's performances as the unsaintly delinquents Peter and Paul were a bit faux on style & delivery. Haneke incorporates much homage to the brilliant Stanley Kubrick flick ""Clockwork Orange"" with its numerous references and similar themes. But that Kubrick film ran like clockwork on superb timing and precision, while ""Funny Games"" was not all that it was cracked up to be. *** Average",Funny Games
37,Chris_Docker,I was bored,5,5 April 2008,"Funny Games U.S. (two stars)Haneke is a director who likes playing with your head as you watch his films. He did so brilliantly in Hidden, a complex mystery on several levels, at least one of which needs the audience to admit their complicity. Impressed, I went to see the English language re-make of his own film, Funny Games, and was very unimpressed.Funny Games is an experiment with the viewer's reaction to violence. Two polite young men enter a wealthy couple's holiday home and terrorise them. Most of the actual violence is off-screen. The viewer is teased and tempted to see more violence, with the perpetrators sometimes addressing the camera and asking what we would like in terms of torture and plot development - before turning the tables on us.It's all very clever. If it wasn't fatally flawed.Firstly, most modern viewers will at least question the assumption that wanting to see a violent movie is wrong. Some research from the 1960s suggests that violent films encourage violent behaviour. Since then over 2,000 books and articles have been written about it. The case against showing violence to children carries some conviction, as does the case against showing violent images to people predisposed to violence. But many modern viewers might be of a similar mind to studies suggesting violent images simply provide a vicarious outlet for violent impulses. That they serve a valuable social function. Not to mention the big proportion of cinema-goers that would not dream of committing a violent act, whatever images you show them.Haneke's premise in re-making the film is that it needs to reach its target audience. Young Americans. Impressionable people in a country that suffers more than any civilised nation from gun crime. If the original 1997 film had been made in English, I might have agreed. But I suspect that most 2008 audiences are far too sophisticated.Many viewers will already know the plot and theme  thanks to the first film or the copious media coverage. It's not so clever when you know what's coming.In fact it can be boring. I would have liked a little more in the way of plot. I don't need an amateur psychologist trying to show that I egregiously lust after violence.Funny Games still has some very good points. You may want to note the difference in your (or the rest of the audience's) reactions to violence against bad guys as opposed to violence against good guys. Dear Mr Haneke, is it OK to blow someone away cos they are a bad person?It is worth seeing for Naomi Watts excellent performance, who portrays the terrified victim immeasurably better than the usual stereotype. And it is worth seeing if you cannot be bothered wading through the identical original language version when such viewer-involvement was far more innovative. It is still an unusual horror film. As an 18 certificate, presumably those impressionable, violence-orientated youngsters at whom it is aimed can't legally see it.Haneke has made some outstanding films. Hidden, the Pianist, Code Unknown  and even his original Funny Games provoked much debate. Sadly this film is not one of his greats.",Funny Games
38,drownnnsoda,"Conspicuously Well Crafted, But Not For All Tastes.",8,15 March 2008,"""Funny Games"" is a remake of a German film (remade by the director of the original) that follows an upper-class family to their beautiful Long Island summer house that rests along the harbor. Ann (Naomi Watts), her husband George (Tim Roth), and their son, Georgie arrive and begin to unpack. While Ann is preparing dinner, she receives some unexpected guests - two well-dressed, soft-spoken golfers, Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet). What at first seems to be an odd intrusion escalates into a violent confrontation, as Paul and Peter take the family hostage and begin to play twisted games throughout the night, betting that all three family members will be dead by morning.For starters, I went into this movie knowing well what it was about, but had not seen the original German/Austrian film so wasn't sure entirely what to expect. I was surprised, however, and enjoyed the majority of the movie, as out-there and as devastatingly blatant it was. A shot-by-shot replication of his original work, director Haneke crafts this film pretty well. It's a slow-goer in the beginning, and the timid, calm, and offbeat pacing is a little strange but appropriate. In fact, the entire film is pretty slow-paced, and the mood, as emanated from our villains, is calm during some of the most tense scenes, which is disturbing to say the least. The cinematography is stunning, too, and there are many beautifully-filmed scenes (this was obvious from the beginning, which includes a very nice overhead view of the family traveling in the car).Many people see this film as a social commentary on media violence, the portrayal of it, and the vast population's desensitization towards it, and I think that it's fairly evident that there's truth to this. The villains, primarily Peter, go as far as talking directly to the audience in an almost interactive experience, thus causing us to feel like voyeurs to these horrible events taking place on screen. It's an interesting idea and an effective turn of the tables, I'd say it was accomplished well. The 'shock' factor is up there, but the violence is also mostly off-screen. We mainly see the aftermath and the characters' reactions, but the horrific acts that take place are unsettling enough. It's hard to classify the film under a genre, really. It incorporates bits of dark comedy and drama within the horror, among other things, but could also very well fall under the ""art house"" sub-genre. My only complaint here would be that at times the film became a little tedious. I know it's a shot-for-shot remake so it was unavoidable, but there are scenes that seem to drag on endlessly for really no reason. Then again, I liked how much of the little aspects were shown. It gave it a more human feel and was less ""Hollywood"" for lack of a better term. Performance-wise, we have a great cast here. Naomi Watts is excellent as usual, playing a somewhat uptight, upper-class wife. Tim Roth plays her husband and the two make a solid duo. Michael Pitt is very well-cast as the lead bad guy, and his interaction with Brady Corbet is often hilarious, and we can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness amidst the horrific situation. Devon Gearhart, the youngster of the bunch, is also fairly solid for being a child actor, and does well here. As for the ending of the movie, well - let's just say a lot of people will be very disappointed. I personally wasn't, in fact I was kind of expecting it, and it was a nice change from what we usually see. Nothing is sugarcoated here.Overall, ""Funny Games"" (US) is a very strange movie. Its social commentary is worth hearing and it's an interesting, unusual film, but I can definitely say that it isn't for all tastes. I'd personally think that a very small percent of moviegoers would enjoy it, but if you're willing to go in with an open mind it is an intriguing experience (plus there is some good acting here from all involved). Worth seeing, but again, there will be a lot of people who will probably not like it. I personally enjoyed it though myself, and you may also want to take a look if you've seen the original. 8/10.",Funny Games
39,hu675,Extremely well acted thriller has some suspenseful moments but there's something very off-putting about this feature.,8,9 July 2008,"Somewhere in the state of New York.

If they don't, the family will pay the price to live.Written and Directed by Michael Hanake (Hidden, The Piano Player, The Time of the Wolf) made an interesting, slow building suspense thriller with elements of black comedy and realistic moments of terror. Hanake remade his own film for American audiences, although i never seen the original. It was shot by shot from the original, even they used the original production design of the family's home. Director Hanake gets good performances from his cast, they play their roles extremely well. The suspense truly works if sometimes truly bizarre (I never did liked when the character of Paul or Peter talks directly to the camera, it been overdone so many times. It's quite tedious.) and the blackish dark humour doesn't always work. One of the good things about the movie is that Hanake truly cares about his characters and they are fleshed-out well.The Canadian DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD only special feature is the original theatrical trailer. I felt this movie was truly misguided by now finished ""Warner Independent Pictures"". I felt the trailers or t.v. spots were a bad homage to ""Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange"". I felt the third act of ""Funny Games U.S."" doesn't really work. I think, the third act could have been much more satisfying. I didn't expect an happy ending to this feature but maybe i was expecting to be more disturbing, i wish they focus less on the dark humour to make it more effective. I felt Hanake's script was sadly predictable and the family in someway they were not very likable people also. But he probably made the most successful shot by shot remake since ""Pyscho"". The only different that Hanake remade himself. There's plenty of interesting Social Commentary in this and it is very well shot by Darius Khondji (Alien Resurrection, In Dreams, Se7en). My other small complain is actor Pitt, he is great in this. But he played the Pyschopath role in movies too many times but it is always different. ""Funny Games U.S."" is a fairly good movie, it does make me wants to see Hanake's 1997 original film. It is not for everyone but for someone is searching for an intelligent harsh thriller, you are welcome to see it. Watts also one of the executive producers on this project.

40,ptb-8,A Clockwork Orgy,1,26 November 2009,"All through watching FUNNY GAMES all I could constantly think was: ""Why would these actors agree to make this boring film?"". Both Naomi Watts and Tim Roth must have enough money by now to not need to 'act' in this...though I did expect Michael Pitt, the young king of 'could-a' would be on this script like a fly on a turd. He does his Leonardo Di Caprio imitation well. But Oh! what a boring film... all CLOCKWORK ORANGE boys and Tarantino casual cruel with lotsa humiliation and degradation masquerading as 'suspense'. FUNNY GAMES is written and directed by the same no-talent director Michael Haneke whose identical version made in 1997 simply proves that he cannot create so he repeats... no new ideas for our Michael. No acting stretch for Mr Pitt and absolutely no reason for Watts and Roth to debase their talent either. The key to the film's cretinous immature existence really is the absurd end scene with the abrasive thrash metal music over the blood red credits: the boring inversion of normalcy or quality. The parents of the young actor who agreed to let their 12 year old boy appear in this atrocity should be in jail. Can you imagine how awful the premiere for this dumb movie was? No uplifting prestige experience and I bet the after party was an embarrassed silent affair. The characters of Peter and Paul in their Norman Bates preppy outfits and scholar style are a throwback to PSYCHO and COMPULSION or even A KISS BEFORE DYING of 1955. Don't forget ROPE (1949). The boys characters in this film reminded me of the sort of inhuman minds Tarantino films appeal to. You know, chatting about some unrelated topic whilst enjoying mutilating a woman's beauty. The loathsome immature Peter and Paul in FUNNY GAMES are exactly the mind I believe Tarantino wants to breed through his films. Hey, the director of FUNNY GAMES is a living example, hence this empty film. If a no talent film maker such as Hanneke wanted to irritate his audience by riffing on 'cool' Tarantino style home invasion mixed with clockwork orange humiliation cruelty then he has pathetically succeeded, but that shows vandalism not creation. I hope Naoimi Watts' family saw this and told to wake up to herself. I hope Haneke was deported.

But soon after they arrive at their house, two young men come to visit. They politely ask for some eggs but refuses to leave when they do. Slowly the dream vacation turns into a nightmare.Comments: I must admit, the characters of Paul and Peter was very unnerving. Always very polite and low-key but extremely psychotic and sadistic at the very same time. A peculiar contrast that lent the movie its dynamic. It was this conflict that made this into a horror movie. That was what made it scary. And for once it was somewhat refreshing that a movie dared to break the boundary and put evil in a seemingly good facade. Not demonizing it with looks and manners.Otherwise there was only one other aspect of the movie that made it stand out whatsoever. The idea of that somehow the characters knew they were in a movie. And while I approved and liked when Paul spoke directly to the audience, involving it in their Funny Games, I very much disliked when he rewind the story when it didn't go as he liked. That was breaking the rules too much. For the horror-movie to succeed you must sympathize with the victims, their struggle. But if the evil can rewind and undo their efforts their struggle not only becomes pointless, but also meaningless. And in that the movie loses its suspense, its credibility.But all in all, from a guy that mostly don't like horror, this was pretty good.6/10",Funny Games
43,Jonny_Numb,"You would cry, too, if it happened to you...",8,14 June 2008,"Remaking his own German-language original, Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" is every bit the sick, tragically ironic ride its title mockingly promises. Whereas many films courting the ""horror"" banner these days are flashy, gritty, and present violence as a gore-drenched slab of meat for the jaded masses to chew on, this film (over a decade removed from its original incarnation) becomes a subtle comment and condemnation of the Eli Roth/Platinum Dunes-types who would be contented if cinematic carnage remained a passive endurance test, punctuated by a joke to take the edge off, jump-scares cued by loud music, and an ending where order is restored.Haneke maintains a coldly objective style throughout, relying on predominantly static framing that-often unbearably-allows what's on-screen to speak for itself. And while much of the film's violence takes place off-screen, the director is disturbingly assured in his depiction of it, transforming the unseen into something far more horrifying (and affirming of our own mortality) than any lopped-off limb or CG arterial spray. In a confined story that runs the risk of feeling stagey, ""Funny Games"" turns our claustrophobia into a metaphor for an inescapable, stomach-sinking journey into our own passivity toward the evils of man.The plot setup is simple, and since any mention of what happens beyond the first 15 minutes would be less than fair, I'll keep it short: an upper-middle class American family-mother Ann (Naomi Watts), father George (Tim Roth), and son Georgie (Devon Gearhart)-travels to their lake house for vacation. George and Georgie set up a sailboat down at the dock, while Ann is getting ready to prep a side of beef that's about to go bad. Soon after, the family's facades of normal, mundane activity are turned upside-down by two white-gloved young men: Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet), who possess a polite, ingratiating manner that portends an unexpected proclivity toward physical violence.Haneke trickily pulls off a feat of finger-waggling moral responsibility while not letting that overshadow the visceral intensity with which the ""games"" unfold. It's a given that any film director condemning the ""viewer vs. Viewed"" attitude toward the way we process ""imaginary"" violence while indulging it runs the risk of hypocrisy, which is why Haneke makes Paul and Peter the calm-voiced counterpoints to what he sees as the heartless-bordering-on-sociopathic mindsets that distance directors from responsibility for their own creations (the sledgehammer bombast of ""Natural Born Killers,"" for example). The tormentors are given no motivation for doing what they do-it is simply a warped projection of what a diseased mind views as ""fun,"" and that is Haneke's point. When Paul refers to himself and Peter as ""Beavis & Butt-Head,"" it's a spot-on observation devoid of humor.As both a remake and a confined film, ""Funny Games"" runs the risk of seeming studied and slick in presentation and performance (something ""The Vanishing"" and ""Diabolique"" were accused of a decade ago), but the aforementioned static framing successfully grounds the film in a bourgeois reality, while the acting is stunning in its lack of self-consciousness. For as subtly calculated as the film is, it never feels much less than authentic. Naomi Watts (who also executive-produced) again proves herself one of the finest actors working today, in a performance that attacks degradation with sympathetic ferocity; Roth is finely restrained (certainly far from his ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" personae) as George, who possesses a genuine helplessness and despair. But it is Corbet and especially Pitt who dominate the film, transforming characters who are essentially hollow shells (save for a bit of existential dialog near the end) into soft-spoken vestiges of evil whose menace is made all the more convincing because of how little we know of them as people.While not as blatantly violent as the latest go-for-broke ""Saw"" sequel, ""Funny Games"" is truly adept at the old adage of ""less is more,"" and realizes just how humorless and sickening the emotional and psychological violation of our fellow human beings really is. By the end, a face full of unassuming malevolence stares us down, mutely asking if we really thought otherwise.",Funny Games
44,raulfaust,Mind blowing,9,20 March 2011,"I first saw this film last year, loved it and just re-watched. You know, ""Funny Games"" is great in many aspects. The pair of villains are very talented and they are those villains we love to hate. Their insanity is visible throughout the whole film; they are ironic, cynical, polite, (very) mean, sadist and in the end they seem to be very clever.I also find it interesting that the whole movie promises much violence and ironically, when it happens, the director hides it from us. This film is disturbing and agonizing, don't give it a chance in a sad day. It will stress you. Overall, a very good film that deserves many re-watches every month.",Funny Games
45,Matt_Layden,Takes Hostel & Saw And Turns It Into An Art Form.,7,8 June 2010,"A family head up to their vacation home when they are interrupted by two young polite boys who want to play vicious and dangerous games with them. The games result in the cost of people lives, as the family is taken hostage. This is of course the American remake of the same film from the same director. Not only is it a remake, but it takes the Gus Van Sant route and makes the film a shot for shot remake. The film stars reservoir dog Mr. Orange himself, Tom Roth. The blonde and beautiful Naomi Watts and the always memorable Michael Pitt. Funny Games manages to take the act of violence and make us want to turn our heads. We go see the films like Saw and Hostel wanting to see the disgusting depravity of it all and Michael Haneke uses this to his advantage and play off that notion in the film. We as the audience expect one thing and are given another.Another film I recently reviewed was Martyrs, which showed us the lead characters and how they had no hope at all of ever surviving. I didn't like that and how it was represented in the film, I had a hard time trying to connect to the characters knowing they were stuck in such a horrible place. I gave the film kudos for making me squirm. Funny Games didn't make me squirm but it did have the same feel for the characters. The moment you know everything is going to end badly is when Paul (Michael Pitt) turns to the camera and talks directly to the audience. This is further proved when the odd yet fascinating scene in which he literally rewinds the film to change the outcome of some events. This tells us that these two characters are in control of everything. Everything they choose to do to the family and everything they choose to let us see. The last shot of the film is very striking. Michael Haneke knew exactly what he wanted to do with the film and when he first released the original back in 1997 he was quoted as saying ""if the film was a success, it would be because audiences had misunderstood the meaning behind it."" I can see traces of that in the film. He knows we as a society are desensitized to violence, so he made the film come off as such. But instead of the film being violent, it's merely about violence itself. Every death takes place off screen and when we finally see the image of blood, it's more striking because of the restrain used earlier. Long still camera shots are used to let the audience sit uncomfortably, waiting to cut away to another shot. We are stuck with the images of the characters in their most humiliating moments. The two antagonists, are young boys dressed in white. Another play on societies conventions of good versus evil, black versus white. They are extremely polite, instead of rude and abrasive. The small things these characters say have such a sinister feel to them, even if they are the most harmless words. Suddenly a line like ""I'm sorry, I've been so clumsy, I do apologize"" feels as if he is threatening and about to do harm. They are always calm, cool and collective. Funny Games is something of an experiment and Haneke is the one who is either laughing or disappointed. He knew what he wanted and he got it, whether or not we know of it. I won't bother seeing the original, as reviews state they are identical aside from the obvious (Language and Actors). Funny Games as a film is directed with precision and acted strongly from the entire cast. Even the young boy surprised me. At times I was reminded of Mr. Orange screaming on the floor in agony because Roth uses that same high pitch voice. I know there are people out there who detest the film, which is why it works. If you love it, you're sick, if you hate it, you missed the message. If you think you got the message, you probably didn't. Me? I don't know exactly how I feel about it, I do know I didn't hate or love it. I guess I'm that anomaly in the equation.",Funny Games
46,moviewizguy,Shall We Begin?,7,13 April 2008,"In this exploration of our violent society and how depictions of violence reflect and shape our culture, a middle-class housewife Anna tells the story of how she and her husband George and their 10-year-old son Georgie submitted both physically and mentally to the torture, violence, and death foisted upon them by two young, unexpected, white-gloved visitors at their weekend vacation retreat near a lake.I have seen the original film, twice. The first time, I didn't like it. I thought it was unfair and that the director's message out to the American audience is just stupid, because it isn't logical. The second time I watched it, I had more love for it, however, still not enough for me to recommend it. Now, seeing the remake, I will recommend it. I guess it's one of those films where the more you watch it, the more you'll like it and begin to understand things more clearly.Of course, this movie and the original isn't for everyone. I just thought, since this movie, rather than the original, is translated to English, it would be better suited for the American audience. Things in here, that weren't in the original, seems much more logical and rational, although it's still not that realistic. You get better performances, most notably by Naomi Watts, and the picture looks great.Other than that, the movie is the same. It's not exactly a shot-for-shot remake, but it has the same scenes. You get a cell phone, you get people who actually know the police's number, etc. What I also liked was that this film made me realize some things, or one thing, that I didn't realize happened in the original, which tells a lot about how Germans and Americans act differently to the same situation.If you're watching this film for the first time, watch it. Then watch it again. Then watch it again. You're bound to continue to like it even more each viewing. The message of the movie is the same. I'm not saying you should watch it or not. Those who don't need to watch it, don't. Those who do need to watch it, do.",Funny Games
47,Sergeant_Tibbs,I saw the original years ago and this still took me by surprise.,9,10 July 2013,"Having seen the original Funny Games from 1997, I didn't think it would be necessary for me to watch the remake. I'm genuinely surprised that it's significantly better and ironically for the fact that it's a Hollywood remake - that mere fact makes the film a bigger and better statement to its message of a critique of violence in films. Briefly, I think it's all about the viewer's emotional response to the film's choices and it's really remarkable in how effective it is. I love the idea I learned in film studies that the frequent use of the colour white as a way to remind the audience that they're just watching a film. Truly a fantastic and complex film.9/10",Funny Games

I was really excited about watching Funny Games since its considered one of the most violent & psychological torture of its times. Sadly I'm disappointed from the final result. The first one hour of the movie is absolutely terrific but the moments the bulling demented guys shot one person dead and leave the house. The movie fell flat on its face. For next thirty minutes we see two remaining victims crawling & roaming in the house. In real circumstances you would run, scream, always keep a Knife or Gun in hand as the might come back as you've seen their faces. But NO, they're blowing the F******* mobile. And what a P**** Husband. Seriously, he does nothing and fell flat after beaten by one stick. She should be glad that they're killing him. Anyways, the 2nd half is complete disappointment & psychopaths talking to camera in between or remind with remote when Naomi shot one guy dead is Ammature. Naomi Watts's performance is superb in physically & mentally demanded role. She stays in two piece clothing & getting mentally abused for most time of the movie. Tim Roth was miscast. Or maybe his character was soo coward that it's unacceptable. Michael Pitt & Brady Corbet are creepy young fellows, you just want to smash their heads until the die. It defiantly means that they've succeeded being creepy. Overall, Catch first hour (B+) and Trash second hour (C-).",Funny Games

50,antoniotierno,a piece of art with top notch performances,8,15 July 2008,"Haneke chose to remake for America the 1997 Austrian film, following the original with a literal English script. The story works very well in my opinion because it seems to have a life of its own. Key to its success is a great performance by Michael Pitt as Paul, one of two preppy kids who turn killers; Naomi Watts and Tim Roth are extraordinary as well. Watts, especially, gives her all in a mostly reactive role, moving from quiet neighbor to protective mother, to helpless victim in the end. The story is of course disturbing and distressing, extremely strong, and highlights the fleeting boundary between reality and fiction. Overall it's a stylish and satirical horror-thriller, raising many serious questions about violence and about Hollywood's audience requests.",Funny Games
51,brchthethird,As torturous for the audience as it is for the main characters,5,14 November 2014,"This an oppressively dark twist on the home invasion genre which is as cruel to the audience as it is to the main characters. In it, two seemingly nice young men insinuate themselves into a family's house and then proceed to mercilessly torture them psychologically and physically, all with a rather smug arrogance which was very off-putting. The whole situation is very self-aware, as Paul (one of the youths) breaks the fourth wall several times. Still, this movie is a chore to watch, with many scenes of unbearable tension. This is a positive, but it wears down on the viewer, and when help never comes you wonder why you sat through this pretentious mess in the first place. Maybe it's supposed to be some commentary on violence, but to me it was empty and soulless.",Funny Games
52,ElijahCSkuggs,Killing with kindness.,8,23 March 2008,"For years I've been putting Michael Haneke's Funny Games off. For myself it's one of those flicks you know you'll see, and if given the chance you'll take full advantage of it. But I've never gotten the chance. So, when his newly remade American version came out, I decided why the hell not. And hell, I enjoyed it.If you don't know what Funny Games is about it's real simple. A couple of teenage psychopaths terrorize a wealthy family in their own home. That's it. Pretty simple, but very effective. The fun kicker to it all is that the young psychopaths are very well-spoken and pretty intelligent. It's a real bizarre feel that brings the movie to another level of horror.The two young stars are led by Michael Pitt, from Bully, The Dreamers and a bunch of other flicks. Up until now I was never a fan. But with this role, he delivers the film's best performance. Tim Roth and the other psychopath do nicely as well. But Naomi, sometimes she's alright, sometimes she feels like she over-doing it. She over-did it here. Though I gotta give her credit for producing so much snot. Man, when she needs to put on the tears, she really puts them on. And she's also in her underwear quite a bit as well, which was nice cause she's got a great butt. She was also sporting some nice camel toe as well. I know some of you will enjoy that bit. Funny Games was a nice little flick that delivered on almost all levels. There were a couple lags where the scene would drag, but whenever Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet are on screen the movie comes to life with a vibrant insanity. You'd think seeing this one would fill my Funny Games needs, but actually I'm more excited than before about seeing the original.",Funny Games

Actually, it's pretty boring at some points and the tension levels are not so high. It has the same problems as the original (some situations could've been avoided but the characters are too silly... ugh!). It's worth it only because of the photography and Naomi Watts's performance.",Funny Games
54,Andy-296,Well made but pointless,5,30 November 2008,"A well made but generally pointless shot-by-shot remake of the 1997 Austrian movie ""Funny Games"", by its director, Michael Haneke. A wealthy family living in a posh house near a lake is assaulted, brutalized and eventually killed by two seemingly polite young men. The movie's theme is not really about violence - there is nothing here that explains violence or tells you why the human race is so prone to violent behavior - this would require an explanation based in great part in evolutionary psychology and a post 1968 cultural Marxist like Haneke wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. It's about how Haneke can manipulate the audience and how he can get away in approving the violence of the young men. Of course, if the brutalized family instead of rich was working class or poor, Haneke couldn't conceive of making such a movie: despite his smugness, Haneke can't escape his run of the mill Marxist thinking. That aside, Funny Games is generally well made, and if Haneke meant to shock the audience, he is pretty successful in doing that.",Funny Games
55,sharky_55,Why not?,3,19 October 2016,"Michael Haneke is one of the last few living propagators of cinematic modernism that we have left (RIP Abbas Kiarostami). Many know his 2005 masterpiece, Caché, or Hidden, but misread it and furiously focused on the answer to the puzzle of the video-tapes while brushing past the slow compression of historical and classist guilt and distress around Georges. Others know The White Ribbon, his modernist response to Hollywood Holocaust films such as Schindler's List, dubbed 'a whodunnit without a denouement, a historical parable without a lesson'. But of all these films the most brash and unsubtle of them is clearly Funny Games. It forgoes the building of suspense or mystery; it doesn't lay down breadcrumbs for the audience to pick up or confront them with possibilities to unlocking new answers. It is Haneke at his most uninhibited. This is simultaneously the film's triumph and downfall. Haneke employs a certain grit and cold realism that reinforces the brutality and sadism of the film's violence. There is no non-deigetic sound, only silence to accentuate the harsh screams and cries of pain that ring around the halls, and he utilises long-takes of such agonising length and desperation that we become transported into the scene itself, hurriedly glancing behind our shoulders as if Peter and Paul might return at any moment, golf club in hand. The most telling sign of Haneke's success in this department is the backlash towards the film. It cannot be more obvious in the reactions of those who call the film's action a depraved and sadistic affair, or mindless garbage, that they have been long coaxed by what Haneke is trying to disarm himself: the flashy, aestheticised violence and carefully cultivated endings of today's blockbusters. The modernist form also lends itself an aesthetic self-consciousness and reflexivity, and an acute awareness of its own origins and contextual influences of the past. Haneke cleverly weaves this aspect into his own battle; through Paul's breakings of the fourth wall, goading and questioning their audience and ensuring their complicity with what is being portrayed on the screen. A bet is made to signify the commodification of all that is great in violence. This is not, of course, a mutual agreement - Haneke posits that our desensitisation towards violence is so great that none of us should have any problem with what we are watching, and so from this he builds and builds. It's a grumpy old man within that can't quite resist or hold back in his agenda, and won't actually stop until every member of the audience has left. But the film is positioned so that with either reaction, he comes away victorious. Avert your eyes, walk out of the theatre (not that many went in the first place), or switch the television off, and his entire argument is justified, in that modern depictions of screen violence are little more than artefacts to stimulate, arouse and then placate our desires. One senses that Haneke looks upon this reaction with a little smugness. And yet stay and revel (if you can) for the entire runtime of Funny Games, and Haneke is allowed to brand you with disgust and the sadomasochistic label. Clearly, if you enjoy and sit and watch the whole thing, you're beyond the mere problem of the media's saturation of graphic violence and need a lot more intervention. So Haneke sets himself up to have his cake and eat it too, and the most intriguing moment in the film reinforces this notion of omniscient control that he asserts. George Junior somehow manages to acquire a shotgun and wield it competently, and sends Peter flying with a cartoonishly exaggerated shot straight into the wall. Haneke dangles the bait, that promise of vengeance and retribution, and then without any precedent, magically rewinds and erases the moment. This is a power move, the cinematic equivalent of Haneke flipping the bird to any viewer left that was foolish enough to hope and dream for that conventional third act resolution. Ultimately Funny Games is basically comprised of these moments - it doesn't enable the seductive powers of storytelling and characterisation and then turn them onto their backs, like Ribbon and Caché were structured. It's an endurance test of your moralities, and at the end of it no one is declared the winner. Except for Haneke himself, who must be positively delighted at all the outrage and controversy. Haneke's own 2007 American remake of the same film is a whole other conundrum. It is, in a nutshell, ideologically bankrupt. Here is a director who has denounced the mainstream, and would be sorely ashamed to sell out at the box office or win an Oscar, but then throws fifteen million into what is basically a meaningless experiment. Not only it is pathetic to watch Haneke wrest with what he should be opposed to, the soulless aimless American remake, but in the process of it the film's agenda is considerably diminished. Everything is cleaner - the actors are prettier, the sets are spotless, the murderers are more charismatic. They stalk through the sleek white decor of the lake house with a devilish grin, and by aestheticising them Haneke has succumbed to his own accusations. And in casting Hollywood stars in leading roles in Roth and Watts, he has commercialised what he vehemently argued beforehand should not be commercialised.Funny Games (1997) - 7/10Funny Games (2007) - 3/10",Funny Games
56,MrGKB,"Amused or not, you can't argue with the message...",7,7 December 2008,"...that viewers of violent entertainment are, to one degree or another, complicit in the violence. In this remake of his original 1997 German language version, auteur/professor Michael ""La Pianiste"" Haneke utilizes the terrors of a home invasion scenario to rub the viewer's nose in their own bloodlust. He does this by consistently obviating genre conventions (e.g. the ""good guys"" should win), even to the extent of breaking the fourth wall, forcing his audience into direct confrontation with its ongoing experience, and by allowing one of his characters to alter the course of filmed events. Some will consider this technique to be sophomoric and trite; others may well be startled and confused. Few will react with complacency.Perhaps my rating would be lower for ""Funny Games"" had I seen the original, since remakes so often fail to live up to their inspirations. I haven't, and had to take the film on its own merits. And merits it does have.Beautifully shot by Darius ""The Ruins"" Khondji, with near picture-perfect production design (Kevin ""Kids"" Thompson) and art direction (Hinju ""World Trade Center"" Kim), ""Funny Games"" rests its odd form and structure on the capable shoulders of its five leads, including superb performances from Naomi ""Mulholland Dr."" Watts and Michael ""The Village"" Pitt, along with solid turns from Tim ""Pulp Fiction"" Roth, Brady ""Thirteen"" Corbet, and Devon ""Little Men"" Gearhart. It's an ensemble piece that fires on all cylinders, and this is what makes the filmmakers' conceits work.When Pitt's Burgess-inspired sociopath first winks into the camera, we think he's sharing his ""funny game"" with his partner in crime. Then it happens again, and we're confronted with the voyeuristic nature of our vicarious entertainment. He continues to address the camera, drawing everyone involved into quandaries of morality and ethics. Some obviously consider these questions banal, shopworn. Others find them tiresome, irritating; they were promised a home-invasion thriller laced with sadism, and get their expectations thwarted and minds played with. When Pitt grabs the remote and yanks the film into a new frame of reference, we realize that all bets are off and anything we don't want to see happen probably will. Sure enough, Baneke finishes his upper middle class boogeyman tale with a dousing of last hopes and promises of further injustice. His final reversion to a ""typical"" Hollywood ending mirrors the equally ""typical"" opening, an audio jump cut that instantly establishes the unsettling tone of the movie. Baneke's use of long camera shots focused on mundanity while soul-chilling things are happening just out of frame gives ""Funny Games"" a particular tension that reminded me of John McNaughton's ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"". Both films evoke and express the banality (and inexplicability) of evil rather well.At any rate, it's a very watchable film, certainly worthy of a far greater audience than it's gotten in this country so far, and not just for a well-toned Watts in her undies. I'm bemused that both versions of ""Funny Games"" earned their best ratings from teen females (though, of course, their vote was slim here on the IMDb); what was it that moved them to vote so inordinately high? Was it mooning over a favorite actor, or something else? No matter, I find myself interested in tracking down the original, which sports a full point and a half IMDb rating over this English language upgrade. Lookin' forward to it.Oh, and by the way, no, this one ain't for children. Unless YOU'RE the sadist.",Funny Games
57,rockman182,Funny Games (2007),6,14 February 2017,"A film that I was supposed to watch back in 2007 but just never got around to. Oddly enough this is the American remake of the Austrian film of the same name directed by the same filmmaker. Apparently, this film is a shot for shot remake of the previous incarnation. While I can't judge how it holds up to the original, I can say this film is a rather elegant torture porn film.The film is about two psychopaths (straight from the synopsis describing the characters) who invade a family's home and torture them, while playing sick and sadistic games with them. It's hard to say more about the film without really spoiling things, so I'll refrain from talking much more about the plot. The film is not for people who can't deal with uncomfortability in film; there's a whole lot of it. Let's face it, the film is quote grim. This isn't really a hopeful film and you kind of have to expect that before going in.The film is slow and prodding, often calculated. It's tense, and meant to be that way. There's a lack of things going on but it helps enhance the reality of the situation that the victims are in. This film has great performances from Naomi Watts and Michael Pitt. I bet this is what got Pitt his role on Boardwalk Empire. The filmmaker employs single takes which cover longer scenes. The camera is also quite personal to the characters plights. There's a lack of score for giant portions of the film, it's honestly a paced out horror film which isn't very scary but gets you to root for the survival of its protagonists. The antagonists and their backstory could have used some exploration but I guess it wasn't meant to be.This film sort of fits in a sub genre of its own, and reminds me of more successful films like Vacancy and The Strangers. While there are aspects of the film which really work, I still thought the film feels very long and the lack of progression can hurt your attention to the film. At times the film is an arduous task. Off the bat, this film is a one time watch and probably not anything to rave about. It's not a poorly made film by any means, one could point to it as a better film of the survivalist horror family.6.5/10",Funny Games
58,tbills2,Funny Games Is No Laughing Matter,6,22 April 2019,"I'm not playing around, I love Funny Games! It's very well directed with smart writing, an all-star cast and an originally conceived concept for a one of a kind gory motion picture show! It is a detailed account of the timeline of things that could technically sadly happen leading up to a poor and an innocent family being mercilessly terrorized in their very own home by evil murderers and left broken, in utter shambles and mourning, as well as ultimately obliterated themselves. Seriously, watch this film. This is one really twisted movie in all though I feel it slightly whiffs on being a true reenactment of an horrific experience as it misses the mark pertaining to the true nature of chaos and the specific progression of events that would seemingly actually unfold between guardians of a child versus terrible unwanted houseguests before such a loving family could be taken hostage as such in such of a violent way. Being held in dire restraints, the desperate victims here don't seem very desperate. They don't put up too much of a very strong hearted fight back for their lives, remaining rather unrattled in my observation and a tad too ridiculously calm throughout their helpless situation. Funny Games is so tasteful however too artsy. I love Naomi Watts! Naomi's so, so, so awesomely hot in her cute light blue buttoned up flower housewife's dress in this and so beautiful when she removes it into her bra and white pair of undies which she is in so very much in Funny Games towards the end of it once the killers do take control. Naomi's so sexy in this, this spooky, grisly, truly nuts and grimly depicted piece of art house cinema. Funny Games offers us all an elitist's perspective of a true day and night spent in absolute terror when while on vacation at their lake house with their kid, a married couple unfortuitously encounter a couple of deranged, vicious teenage acquaintances of a close friend of theirs as they footheartedly invite these two young, psychotic and not your typical psychotic, monstrous men into their home when suddenly, bam, it becomes all too clear that these villains mean business, as they have haphazardly hatched an insane plan to play a deadly no going back game of do or die. Funny Games is really good, really sexy, thank you Naomi Watts so very much, and generally scary to think about unless you're prepared for it. Tim Roth is good. Michael Pitt is also very good too.

Loeb and Leopold were gay too. look it up. it's a true crime history fact.look, i'm Gay(i frick'in think. i don't know i'm pretty uptight and always get it all wrong), but i'll tell you this. the Gay community white washes it behavior all the time. most organized groups do. every group wants to think that everyone within their group is fine. BULL. Gay men and women are human beings and human beings are less than perfect that's for sure. a lot of Gay people can be callous, mean, and just plain rotten. just like anyone else. only they can't bring themselves to admit it. just because you are openly Gay and comfortable with it doesn't mean you are automatically a good person. and any Gay person that believes that is deluded.i hate people that only want you to see the good. that is quite idiotic. there is good in life and people, but lets face facts folks, the way the human race is acting right now does'nt look good.this movie is some what homophobic, but it points out some interesting facts, people often have a dark side they won't admit to. i myself can be pretty down right mean and intolerant. often times the more you try to think of yourself as perfect and good, your dark side catches up with you. when i first came out some thirty years ago i felt optimistic about Gay people. after what i've seen over the years, i no longer feel that way about it. Gay people should be confronted with this movie. at least they should know about it. i'm sure most Gays would'nt approve of the negative portrayal, but it might get them to question their authority and the way many Gays act. i might not be perfect but there are some things i just don't approve of.how do Gays want to portray themselves? as white washed and sugar coated? that kind of delusion won't end well. leave the sugar coating to the Disney people. at least they're good at it.",Funny Games

It's really a perverted psychotic game where our feelings and our senses are put in test, as we were part of it! In fact, there're a few scenes where the character PAUL (the most perverted one, played by Michael Pitt) talks directly to the camera, asking for viewer's opinions, making it almost an interactive game (and a scene like that, back in 1997, was something outstanding! Just a little note about it: I think that the actor in the original film did those scenes with a little more conviction than Michael Pitt did)! It's really a cat-mouse game where, from the beginning, we know who will win Evil! Since the beginning we see that evilness will triumph over goodness in this film. There's no chance to escape from it, and the proof is that sadistic and even more sarcastic scene when ANN (Naomi Watts) shoots to death PETER (Brady Corbet), and, unexpectedly, PAUL takes a remote control and rewinds the film until the previous scene, changing the incident! She can't kill him, because evil can't die in this movie! I think this is a great metaphor to portray the ""real life""! Because evil also triumphs too many times in ""real life"", and the ""heroes"" that we're always watching in cinema (especially in Hollywood's films) don't exist in a great number out there One detail that turns this movie very realistic, and proves the ""anti-hero"" personality of the injured characters, is when the disturbed guys broke GEORGE's (Tim Roth) leg with a golf stick. From then on he's suffering, having a sore behaviour (we can see it on his face), like anyone of us would be if we have a broken leg! It's not like in some action movies where we watch the guy being shot three times, in the chest, arm and leg, and still fighting as if nothing had happened! In general I think this movie is a great essay on evilness and Human's perversity. It's really sadistic, from the psychological point of view, and worst of all, it offers no chance to the victims to escape, from the beginning! As it is a faithful and well done remake I score it 10/10, the same score I would give to the original!",Funny Games
61,RJBurke1942,Where you experience what happens when sociopaths drop in for games.,8,18 February 2011,"If you ever wanted to know what it's like to experience a horrifying home invasion by sociopaths, this one's for you.My introduction to director Haneke came when I saw his original German version in the late nineties. After watching, I promised myself that I'd see every movie he has made and will make. Like David Lynch, Haneke deals with the essence of human nature, encompassing the worst and, occasionally, the not so bad. Whether he ever sees more than just a glimpse of the good is an open question.I won't go into the plot because I want you to experience it without any preconceived notions about what to expect, nor spoil what happens. It's enough to know that any home invasion is terrifying and potentially horrific. We all read about home invasions in the news, and then move on to the funnies, or sports, or what's on TV. In sum, that's what Haneke is explicitly criticizing in all of us: our dislike of real, actual violence, generally, that is diametrically opposed to the overwhelming presence and acceptance of violence in the media and, particularly, in mainstream cinema, TV and video games.Hollywood made a good stab at filming home invasion with The Desperate Hours (1955) with Bogart as the boss of a criminal gang; but, it's tame in comparison to this and others (see below).The acting by the small cast is outstanding: Naomi Watts (as Ann) gives the performance of her life, as does Tim Roth (as George) – normally in tough guy parts but here as a nice guy who just can't handle it. Devon Gearhart (as Georgie) is a revelation with his skill at taking on such a harrowing role; the sequence when he is chased into a nearby house by one of the invaders is every child's worst nightmare. The supporting cast is professional and unobtrusive.The invaders – Michael Pitt (Paul) and Brady Corbett (Peter) – are simply merciless as they infiltrate and take over the home of George and Ann. The acting by those two is flawless. So good, it's almost disconcerting to see just how effective they both are. And, made doubly so because, during that whole invasion episode, Haneke introduces a twist that will confuse some, maybe many viewers. Some viewers will be turned off, I think. Hence, should you see this movie, be prepared for something different for your viewing pleasure. And, no, I'm not talking about the fact that there is no music sound track to buy; the only music heard is from a CD player in George's car.There are few movies comparable to this one. I can single out Audition (1999), perhaps, as another example of true horror which, for gory visual effects, is much worse than this one. Another is Irreversible (2002) which contains the worst rape scene yet put to film – almost nothing is left to the imagination. So, I recommend Irreversible for film professionals and critics only, because of its unique construction, photography and sound track. From another perspective, other so-called horror films – such as the SAW, Freddie Krueger, and Halloween franchises – just don't rate because they're all fantasies, more or less. Funny Games is reality that can and does happen, everyday in many societies around the globe.From the filmic aspect though, Haneke, in contrast, uses camera and sound to film what you don't see – much like Lynch – to heighten suspense and dread. Playing around with the viewer's mind is often much more effective than showing explicitly. You've probably seen enough Hitchcock to know that.If you do see it, try this: as you watch, note all the basic security mistakes Ann and George make at the outset. Hmmm – make a game out of it, as you watch! This is for adults only, of course. I'd suggest you being wary about letting your teenage sons and daughters see it.",Funny Games
62,Christian_Dimartino,"It's torture for them,and torture for me too.",3,19 September 2010,"Naomi Watts and Tim Roth play a couple being terrorized by two very annoying murderers in Funny games. And to tell you the truth,watching this movie is it's own form of torture. Maybe i'm just a baby, but I can't find anything interesting about senseless violence without a plot. I hated Natural born killers,and I hated this movie too.The movie involves a family(Naomi Watts and Tim Roth and their son) who travels to their lake vacation home. While there, they meet two strange young men(Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) who say that they know the family's friends. But they don't. They were holding them hostage. And hold this family hostage too. And tortures them and makes them play life or death games.What was the point of this movie? It's the most pointless thriller since Natural born killers. I didn't hate it quite as much as that movie, but I still hated it. This is a pointless, heartless thriller that will serve no purpose what so ever. I hated it so much that I had to stop watching it.I don't mind violence. I like Robert Rodriguez movies. I won't even mind kids dying in a movie. But if it's violence without a story plot, and the actors annoy, then I won't like it. and I didn't. Really, Funny games is a miserable film.1/4",Funny Games
63,gigan-92,What do you think? Think they stand a chance?,9,16 November 2010,"Well, That Was Rather unexpected.B+ I barely saw this film the other night on, of all things, a line-up of classic Horror movie marathon run. Michael Myers, Freddy type stuff. But soon in, I realized I was looking at something quite different. Let me start by saying this, that I'm not a horror fan or gory suspense fan by any means. It takes classics like ""Halloween"" or the Evil Dead films to truly leave a mark with me. Films like the Saw franchise try hard to present themselves as something different, but in actuality it's the same gore fest re-tweaked with a few plot twists and we're made to believe this is suspense, drama, but yeah, yawn. The general audience is used to clichés that I hardly need mention. But from time to time we are challenged with a fresh twist: kill the protagonist, all of 'em, but have an 'intriguing' yet no doubt sadistic antagonists who will disturb viewers to the point we won't care if everyone dies. Well, I'm hardly impressed either way. Not to be too hard on the genre, but the vast majority of horror is forgettable.Now this film is an re-make of a 1997 film actually, but for once in film making one can hardly tell it's a re-make. In fact, the film remains basically unchanged at all, asides that it's now in English. What was the point of this re-make then, you are probably asking? Well, director Haneke obviously thought most people would not be inclined to sit through a subtitled foreign film. Only rarely can audiences enjoy subtitled films, say ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""letters from Iwo Jima"", or various Godzilla movies that prior had atrocious dubbing. Pretty obvious seeing as even here on IMDb this new film has 10,000 more votes than the original. With that said, I won't rate this re-make any lower than my view on the original, nor the original any higher. It's a well effort film with superb acting and excellent tension. It's a shame the American re-make was received so poorly.Anyhow, I will put it to people like this. The film has a very eerie and almost silent tension. An aura of dread is constantly given off by Brady Cobert and Michael Pitt quite nicely. Tim Roth and Naomi Watts appear very lost and absolutely terrified throughout. As it unfolds this is not a gore hound's Saturday night treat, an aspect I adored actually. Don't get me wrong, well used and placed violence in a film creates terror, believable pain among other things, but recently horror movies and yes, even some 'thrillers' rely on it far too heavily. It is used sparsely here, the only real time we see it on screen is the 'rewind' moment. But as soon as one of the murderers goes off to make himself a sandwich, that's when I knew the fate of the family didn't really matter. When the movie goes against all expectation and the child meets that unfortunate fate, coupled with the fact that he's the FIRST victim, it truly becomes something else. This is definitely a 'horror', somewhat of a thriller, but overall more of a satire really. Of what? The genre as a whole. The fourth wall is broken a number of times just to cement that. Some call the plot illogical, the climax unsympathetic and overly cruel. And oh yes, let's not forget, not enough (on-screen) gore, bloodshed and violence. With this movie, all that is basically irrelevant. The original and re-make both had no intention of being such a film. It's a hell of a lot better than what film makers of the genre are putting out these days. I highly recommend the film. To who is the answer most struggle with; to anybody who's tired of Hollywood's constant re hash of pointless violence for the sake of it. Over anything, this film is supposed to leave the viewer asking themselves one important question: ""Why did I come in expecting, thirsting, for violence? For some gruesome torture scenes so vivid it could be like watching an autopsy gone wild?"" Why is society, so thrilled by it? Watch the original or the re-make, either way the result is the same.",Funny Games
64,rajdoctor,Funny Games U.S.,8,3 June 2008,"Psychological thriller! This was the only factor that made me go and see this movie.The movie revolves around five characters  a family and two visitors. Ann (Naomi Watts), her husband George (Tim Roth) and their son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) constitute the family and Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet) form the psychological pair of strangers. Their only purpose is to play this game with one family after another  to kill them. Most of the movie happens in the summer house and its vicinity areas. All bloody torture and killings too happen off the screen. But the thrill is enormous. Three times in the movie Paul turns towards the camera and tells the audience  this is the way you love it and want it - I will give it to you.This movie is a re-make of 1997 Austrian movie by the same name. This time, it gets an international expose and release.Michael and Brady excel in their roles of courteous young boys dressed in white, with softy feminine looks, walk and talk. They never loose control of their sophisticated demeanor to fool around and confuse the people they talk with. Naomi Watts plays this surviving wife's role with great will. Tim Roth as a fractured leg helpless husband is also good  so is Devon Gearheart.The German Director Michael Haneke (Piano Teacher fame) plays this psychological mind game with ease. He uses a steady camera and allows the audience too to relax to be part of the drama. But don't be mistaken, the movie is edge of the seat entertainer.I can readily assume that not many people might like the narrative style of the movie. There is no outwardly showcasing violence  that is what people are looking for. They might be! The musical score also is pitched pertinently at various points to enhance to beauty of the tragedy. I found it a great learning by the style alone.Go and watch this scary little masterpiece. Its nice.(Stars 7.75 out of 10)",Funny Games
65,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"Child murder, no laughing matter",7,9 April 2013,"I remember the original coming out. I never saw it, until years after seeing this remake which I liked better. For one, we see the sexy Naomi Watts, in bra and panties, not like the older duck in the other one. This one too was more effective, I almost wish the original never existed. May'be if seeing the original first, my opinion would of differed, though I don't think by much. This one too has better actors, but is slightly less violent. The movie moves in steady, perfect flow of it's 108 minutes. The plot basically has two sicko's who terrorize this couple while on holiday in their lavish two storey lake house. They are first seen at the neighboring house, where the male neighbor friend of Roth's and Watts, doesn't looks on edge in the boys presence. Later on, the boys one of them comes over to the house, and asks if he can borrow a golf club, he's infatuated over. Permitted to do so, he goes off to test it out, but in another way. The remaining boy, the more creepier one, who for some of you audience, his face, will be etched in your mind for a while, asks to borrow some eggs. He leaves and purposely drops them, returns and asks for some more. Soon Watts is onto this act and unnerving behavior. Roth thankfully returns in great timing to set these boys straight. But the minutes that ensue, it becomes the other way around, where Mother, Father, and boy literally become hostages in their own home. So begins a terrifying and draining viewing experience, as these two rich ""why don't you get a life di..heads"" play their own games, providing some disturbing moments, especially for the little kid whose murder later on, that I never foresaw, became an absolute moment of shock, when hearing that gun go off, and thinking ""No, he hasn't""? Pitt as the better looking torturer, somewhat played in another familiar themed film, Murder in Numbers, where he played the innocent follower to his mate (Ryan Gosling's) character. Him and the other boy, especially create believable menace here. Funny Games doesn't have a happy ending, especially for the other two innocents, where after the boys murder, things get more intense. What I said about it's unhurried flow before, which I loved, goes for scene specially, where the camera stays on Roth, wounded, for over five minutes, where he's consoled by Watts. That line, just before she went to help, where she said ""I loved you"" had a great memorable effect. Though we are not given any insight, as to the boys motives for their murderous behavior, it will leave some of you hypothesizing after. God knows why, as also in real life, what compels kids from rich families, with everything ahead of em, to just one day, go on murderous killing sprees, and throw their whole life down to the toilet. But, as in Funny Games, other movies, and real life, with these tragic events, what triggers these rich kids to take kill is something we'll never know, as even most psychiatrists, wouldn't be able to get to the core of these messed up kid's problems.",Funny Games

67,LoneWolfAndCub,Self-awareness and a minor flaw in the message do not detract from powerhouse performances and excellent direction,8,21 September 2008,"First things first, I have not seen the Michael Haneke's original 1997 Funny Games, however, according to every reviewer, I do not need to (I'm still going to, though). Apparently this American version of Funny Games is a shot-for-shot remake of the original, but with different actors and in English. Also, before seeing this (a year late, as us Australians get most films later) I had read plenty of articles and reviews detailing how dark, powerful and disturbing Haneke's film was. Well, they were damn right. This is a brutal and abrupt film, with no happy endings in sight throughout the majority of the film.Beginning with a wealthy family: George (Tim Roth), wife Ann (Naomi Watts) and Georgie (Devon Gearhart), driving to their holiday home by a lake. Upon arrival a young boy, Peter (Brady Corbet), knocks on their door asking for eggs. A simple task turns into something a bit more complicated, which frustrates Ann and causes her to ask him to leave. However, Paul (Michael Pitt) also enters the scene. Soon the situation loses control as the family as held hostage by the two sociopaths and subjected to cruel and sadistic games.This seemingly overdone home-invasion scenario is the set-up for Haneke's hard-hitting social commentary (and the reason he remade the film for American audiences). Violence is present everywhere in society, through books, games, films, television and music. Although I do enjoy violent films and games, it is not hard to see the public are slowly becoming desensitized to violence. Sometimes we may not even notice what we are watching or reading is violent (the news, the papers and even cartoon shows aimed at children). This is the film's target, and this is why Haneke remade it for the U.S., as he believes that this is mostly an American culture. Unfortunately, there is a flaw present in this way of thinking. I believe most people know that when they are watching something like ""Hostel"" or ""Die Hard 4.0"" it is all fake, all special effects and it is only there as a form of escapism from one's life. It is interesting to note that this film is not that bloody, with almost all of the violence occurring off-screen, the camera focusing on the witnesses reactions instead. Funnily enough, this annoyed a few reviewers on this site, which kind of proves the director's point. We are hungry for violence in our films, we want to see it all.""You shouldn't forget the importance of entertainment."" States Peter when Ann asks them to kill them so the pain can end. The director turns film conventions on their head, as Paul breaks the fourth wall and addresses us, asking us questions. (In this way the film is somewhat pretentious and self-aware, Haneke kind of knows he is making an arty film and it is slightly annoying). Paul knows almost everyone is rooting for the family to survive, for some miraculous way out for them. However, Haneke knows that more often than not, the cavalry never come and the bad guys usually do win.Upon pointing out Haneke's fault, the man can direct with incredible style. The egg scene is an interesting one, as almost nothing happens, yet he constantly increases the tension every second. And that is just the beginning. There are numerous tracking shots, which add to the atmosphere and frustration. In an eight minute scene, we witness Ann trying to escape her bonds and through this silent scene we feel her anguish and it works very well. However, the direction is supported by some of the strongest performances by an entire cast I have seen all year. Naomi Watts is an incredible actress and her performance as the polite housewife turned heroine is riveting. She goes through a heap of crap throughout the movie and she is convincing 100% of the time. Tim Roth is excellent support, his father (who is crippled at the start of the games) is a tragic character. Usually the father character is the macho hero, but here he is a broken man and Roth portrays this with perfection. Michael Pitt is eerie, charming and sadistic as well-spoken Paul, he is the 21st century Alex (from Stanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange""). I am confident he will be a big star in the future. Brady Corbet is more timid, but equally menacing as Peter, the seemingly simpler, but more erratic and violent one. He puts forward an interesting and breakthrough turn and as mentioned before, should be a star to look out for.Although I will probably not revisit this again, it is definitely well-made and challenging film. It is not a pleasing or uplifting film, and although not gratuitous in its violence, is quite stressing nonetheless. It raises some socially relevant issues and as far as remakes go, it is heads and shoulders above the rest.4/5",Funny Games
68,SquigglyCrunch,Well Done but Unfortunately Ruined by One Scene,5,25 November 2015,"I went into this movie being told that it was underrated and amazing. And it was done well for the most part, but unfortunately it made a stupid mistake. The plot is simple, but it's interesting nonetheless. The motives aren't clear, but that just makes it all the more interesting, and makes the characters seem more insane than they are originally depicted. The characters are good, but they weren't good enough for me to care a heck of a lot about them. The movie would have been pretty good as a whole, but it broke the fourth wall, which really took away from the whole experience. Some of these scenes were subtle and more just felt like the character's insanity over fourth wall breaking. But there was one major scene that just completely took me out of the movie, and thus took the enjoyment out as well. Overall Funny Games is done well. the plot is simple yet interesting, and the characters are decent. But this is a perfect example of a movie where one scene can make or break a movie, and in this case one scene breaks the movie. It completely took me out of the experience, and it suffered horribly because of it. I didn't give it a 3-4/10 simply because everything else was done well, so I figured it deserved recognition for that. In the end I would not recommend Funny Games. If one scene won't ruin a movie for you, though, then go ahead and give it a watch. I hate it when the fourth wall is broken, but maybe that's just me.",Funny Games

Familiar territory as ""Man Bites Dog"" and ""Hostel"", without the humor and charm of the first, or the zeal of the latter.This is a film against itself, like the brief discussion of the ""anti material"" world in the boat at the end, this is the anti-horror horror, which though skillfully crafted and executed, is ultimately self-defeating.You may feel that intellectual tingle while watching this, but it's an itch quickly scratched.",Funny Games

Nothing happens in this movie and none of the characters (bad or good) are appealing in any way. I wasn't rooting for any of them. I just wanted it to end.

Funny Games is one of the most genuinely unsettling movies I have viewed in some time. NOT fun to watch! If any movie out there deserves the genre title ""torture porn"", this one certainly deserves the crown. Because that's what sitting through this movie feels like - straight torture. It's a strange thing because the directors goal was to create a movie that mocks the American media's fascination with violence - but all the movie ends up feeling like is a long, slow, and terrible death that you are forced to sit through. If anything, he's crafted one of the most effective modern films of it's kind, not so much an effective statement against it. The writer is due an awful lot of credit for crafting a script with such a bizarre pace. It reminds me of drawn out films like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre at times. But the shining cast is what really brings the movie to life. The entire cast turns in visceral performances that certainly drill into your psyche. Michael Pitt is like a demon disguised in a tuxedo - the minute he shows up, everything feels dreadful and you want him to disappear. Same goes for his lookalike friend ""Tubby"". The most difficult part of getting through the movie is that you sort of need to come to terms with the fact that these two characters need no reason to be doing these horrible things - they may as well not even be considered human, or characters at all. They are simply tools to sculpt a conclusion... although really there is HARDLY a conclusion in the end! This is the most inventive thing about the film, but I will say, it is not at all easy to enjoy!!! It had me very uneasy and upset! This is due to Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, and whoever played the son turning in emotionally crushing performances... You certainly feel for them and it's a painful experience.

73,bob_meg,The cinematic equivalent of a blank canvas,2,1 December 2009,"I've long regarded Funny Games --- in both its incarnations because they're virtually identical with the exception of the performances (1997 is better but not by much) --- as one of those bits of filmic freaklore.It's basically an experimental joke...an ""Aren't I clever?"" film school folly masquerading as some deep pithy sociological McLuhanesque satire on how we are somehow responsible for condoning on screen violence by merely sitting still for it.If that sounds absurd, it is. I'd qualify virtually any other piece of film I've seen in a 45-year lifetime as ""art"" over Funny Games. It's a blank canvas...it's a sacred article profaned as an in joke. It's juvenile and a genuine failure.I can say this with utter certainty because the film lacks what all art --- even controversial art --- has at it's core: genuineness or for lack of a better word, a soul.Take the most grotesque piece of art you can think of and ask yourself this question: ""What was the artist trying to inspire?"" It could be anger, rage, pain....it might be truly repulsive to watch, but it's genuine. Funny Games is not. It's got no other purpose than to manipulate, and what's truly offensive about it, is that it does so in such a shamelessly vulgar, unoriginal, and crude fashion. It's basically a parody of a snuff film, though not as engaging, I'm sure, because it's so utterly false.I give this film stars because yes...it's above average in it's technical competency. The direction and camera-work are very capable and the acting is strong....though it sometimes feels Naomi Watts is trying to recreate her senior year acting class exercises for some unknown reason. Again, there's nothing she can play off of that doesn't feel cheap or rigged-together.I do however think I have finally understood why Haneke has been so obsessed with this failed freshman flick --- enough to make this pointless copy...as the dog returneth to his own vomit, so does the fool to his folly.

The story concerns two sociopaths (Peter & Paul)who get their sick kicks terrorizing white,upper middle class suburbanites with taunts & violence. This is NOT a film for sensitive viewers who could be freaked out by material like this (especially those who have been victims of home invasions,such as the Petit family in Connecticut,who were such victims of a violent home invasion recently).

The conceit of remaking your own film after only ten years exercised by Director Michael Haneke is a debate all on its own. But its transposition from a mid European backwater to affluent USA works.The premise is simple, a wealthy couple (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth) and their eight year old child arrive at their holiday home and are then attacked terrorised and murdered by two teenage assailants. What makes this film different is that we are asked to watch this knowing that we are a crucial part of the film dynamic as the audience. At some points we are addressed directly, and at another the story is rewound. So as this tale of gratuitous violence unfolds, the audience cannot ""enjoy"" it, they are asked to question how they could, or why they would, enjoy it.The ""rules"" of cinema are gleefully trashed. The dog doesn't survive, it ""gets it"" first, the cute kid doesn't survive, he is blown away with a gun, the mother is told to strip, but we don't get to see her naked, the Dad is not a hero he is an impotent spectator. And all of the time as this horrific violence is unleashed, it is always off screen. The message is that if you thought that you as an audience were going to get off on some sex and violence, you are mistaken, it is for the participants only. And the assailants themselves are never less than perfectly, and absurdly, polite.Funny Games prides itself on the surreal. The bad guys are dressed in white, and wear white gloves. The setting is peaceful. The psychotic teenagers initially ask for eggs, which are deliberately broken in extended scenes. The metaphor of the fragility of suburban life, decency and everything around us gruesomely exposed.It isn't perfect, and it probably is too long. But it is also original and a thought provoking antidote to the standard home invasion slasher fare most recently reincarnated with the remake of ""Last House on the Left"" and ""The Strangers"", and is a more successful examination of popular culture's fascination with violence than say Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"", it's natural bedfellow is probably ""A Clockwork Orange"". Perversely, those who enjoy slasher, horror gore are likely to be disappointed by this film whereas those who don't like it are likely to enjoy it.",Funny Games
77,PoisonKeyblade,Note Perfect and Brilliant,10,16 March 2008,"Michael Haneke's Funny Games, a shot-for-shot remake of the critically-acclaimed 1997 horror/thriller of the same name, is a strangely quiet, slow-burning masterpiece of a movie. The acting, the disturbing violence, and the unpredictable ending make for one hell of a ""game."" In fact, the movie is oftentimes almost so realistic that it's difficult to watch. In the bigger picture, the movie has a fantastic message behind it. Why is America so obsessed with watching violence? Can you tolerate just sitting back and watching as something very real is occurring on the screen? The movie is cleverly crafted so that the audience almost feels responsible for all of the horrible things that happen to the characters in this movie. Funny Games stars Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, Michael Pitt, Devon Gearhart, and Brady Corbet, and it is written and directed by Michael Haneke.When a family of three arrives at their remote summer cabin for a quiet getaway, the sudden arrival of two psychotic men sets the stage for a harrowing life-or-death struggle. The strangers (Brady Corbet and Michael Pitt) insist on playing games with the defenseless family (Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, and Devon Gearhart) in cleverly-plotted methods that make for an incredibly disturbing and satiric look at American culture and the act of voyeurism.The dialogue is simply breathtaking. It's all very self-aware, and incredibly realistic. All of the characters act very rationally and, for the most part, don't really do anything stupid. The movie remains shocking from the get-go up until the very last frame. It never holds anything back. As explained in the movie itself, it often ""breaks the fourth wall"", which is an invisible wall between the audience and the movie itself. Paul, one of the antagonists, often talks to the audience or looks directly at them, 'breaking' this invisible fourth wall. This is an extremely interesting concept and it utilized in the most efficient manner, flipping what could have been a conventional slasher movie into an intelligent, 'arthouse' picture.The acting and casting is nothing short of spectacular. Naomi Watts plays the mother so well that you can relate immediately to her story. Tim Roth was fitting in the fatherly role, and little Devon Gearhart was just pitch-perfect as the ten-year-old George. Michael Pitt, who has amazed ever since 2001's Bully, is by far the best actor in the movie, shining in every single scene and being 100% believable as a rich, snobby, bored-out-of-his-mind young man who likes toying with people. Brady Corbet, who was all kinds of fantastic in 2004's Mysterious Skin, is great as the quiet maniac. The believability of the actors is what really makes this movie special.Michael Haneke really knew what he was doing when he made this film. There are all sorts of interesting shots and intense sequences, the most disturbing being one in which someone makes a sandwich. This movie is pure horror, not Hollywood-ized or watered down in any way. It's satire, and it works so well that you almost feel as if you're watching something very real. It is just a crying shame that the movie has a limited theatrical release because it is one of the most original, unnerving, and uncomfortable moviewatching experiences that one will ever have.",Funny Games
78,TheMarwood,Pointless remake of a pointless film,2,1 December 2014,"Michael Haneke directs this shot for shot remake of his 1997 film and the most the film can muster is a giant shrug of the shoulders and perhaps the word 'why?' This cynical middle finger to audiences is too derivative and obvious to have any substantial social commentary and too smug and annoying to work as exploitative trash. It's the kind of film that just plays for itself, content with how clever it's trying to be and Funny Games and Haneke both come across condescending and all the worse for it. It doesn't hold a mirror up to society, it's just a failed exercise from a director who should have known better - twice. The small cast does a very good job with this material and while they are all committed to this junk, it is wasted on a film unworthy of their efforts. Don't waste your time, Funny Games is just a lot of hot air.",Funny Games
79,GeorgeRoots,"Michael Haneke Finally Gets To Make His Movie In The U.S, But Why Was It Even Necessary?",4,24 September 2014,"(Note: I took a large chunk of this from my review of ""Funny Games"" 1997).""Funny Games"" and I have a history. Back in 2012 when I was 20 years old, I viewed this remake of the classic ""Funny Games"" (1997) and hated it with a passion. Why did they not fight back? Why did they not make a getaway at the very moment the invaders leave? Finally an act of defence is instantly ""rewound"", and I felt I had been spat in the face. Jump to 2014 and now more fully aware of director Michael Haneke's original intentions. He wanted to make a movie set in the United States but at the time had to settle for Austria. The entire film was also not intended to be a horror film, saying he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie.Two young men hold a family hostage, and begin to torture them with sadistic games. The men proceed to break mundane cliché's typically seen in horror movies, and also make a bet that the 3 family members will be dead by 9.am the following morning. The leader Paul (Michael Pitt) constantly breaks the fourth wall, addressing the slim chances they have and ever changing your expectations of how the events usually pan out.Even after viewing both versions of the movie (Twice), to me the original remains superior. Anything positive I have to say about the remake is that I'm glad Mr. Haneke got to fulfil his wish, and I respect the level of detail he went into replicating almost every set and shot perfectly. I just find myself really underwhelmed by Naomi Watts, who is a terrific performer, yet Susanne Loathar really brought gravitas as a victim. I also find myself saying the exact same thing for Tim Roth and Michael Pitt's performance.Final Verdict: If you're super shallow to not watch the original Austrian version just because of a language barrier, then I guess this movie is for you. It's the same beautifully shot and wonderfully written movie, maybe it's just me but I cannot get drawn into it like I did the original, or as it's own creation. 4/10.",Funny Games
80,Meven_Stoffat,"Copied and pasted from my review of the original, but they're the same movie, so....",1,24 January 2011,"A little over a month ago, I saw a film called ""Devil"". In it, a group of people are stuck in an elevator that has come to a dead stop, presumably because the presence of the devil is in with them. Throughout the movie, the people act dumb and just stand there wondering what to do, as opposed to actually doing anything, getting slaughtered one by one. They just START to act towards the end, and that's mainly when we find out who the Devil in question is.If you're following me, you should have a similar idea of what Funny Games is like.A family of 3 go on vacation to a nearby lake. They're a perfectly happy family, or so it seems. That is until the backstreet boys... whoops, I mean two boys visit them and they're all nice. Apparently the ma has had enough of them, and even getting the pop to remove them won't work. How do they respond? Whacking him in the leg. WITH A GOLF CLUB.The dad COULD respond by fighting back. Instead, he just moans and groans and hugs his leg because he's so scared he's going to get killed by the evil golf club of doom. I will also point out that there are 2 bags worth of golf clubs, but the wife is dumb enough not to GRAB ONE AND USE IT AS DEFENSE.Throughout all this pointless time of fourth wall breaking and pretentiousness, the family could be responding by fighting back, but no, all they can do is weep and moan at the evil golf club of doom. The wife is forced to strip down and the son is blasted away with a shot gun, all because they couldn't do anything to defend themselves.Oh, but then the two creeps leave for a short period of time. Good, they can do something to defend themselves, right? Like, grab one of the kitchen knives, create a barricade,or best of all, GET IN THE CAR AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE, right? No. NO. Capital N, Capital O.Instead they spend what seems like an hour blowdrying a phone. When they can use it, instead of saying something like ""911, police!!! Two crazy teenagers are invading our home!!! Please get to (address) as soon as possible!!!"", they spend what seems like an eternity shouting ""HELLO???? HELLO????"" into the phone. And because of it, when the two psychos come back, it's back to the game.Oh, I will give the mom credit for manning up and grabbing the gun!!! Oh wait, she only shot one of them and because she apparently, for unknown reasons to the viewer, can't shoot the other, the other grabs a remote and rewinds it. I KID YOU NOT.I could go on and on, but I'm just getting angry about it. I, for once, am getting tired of movies where a group of people is terrorized and they aren't smart enough to defend themselves. Apparently this was the intention of Haneke, as he usually beats his viewer over the head with the theme because we're too dumb and can only watch a simplified story. Either way, avoid this trash. The only thing more terrifying than two teenage boys terrorizing a family with a golf club is a house full of morons who aren't smart enough to defend themselves.",Funny Games
81,flicklover,A less effective but good remake of the Austrian original.,8,3 July 2021,I think that it is rare for an American remake of a foreign language film to equal.or exceed the quality of the original. Most of the time the American/Hollywood remake changes elements of the story to make it more palatable and commercial for a wider audience. When that happens the remake ruins the very thing that made the original good in the first place. The good thing here is that this remake was directed by the original film's director Michael Haneke. The fact is that it's pretty much a shot for shot remake of that film. The tone of the film is the same. Obviously having different actors and language will change some things but ut us very much tge same film as the 1997 original and that's a good thing. It's an English language version of a very disturbing story about a family that gets taken hostage by a pair of psychotic young men that play sadistic games with them. It brings it's audience into the situation by having one of the killers break the fourth wall indicating us as an audience for finding this type of film entertaining.The problem I had was that as well as this remake is well done and I admire that it wasn't Hollywoodized. The fact is because I had seen the original its impact on was reduced because I knew what was going to happen. If I had seen this one first it might have been in reverse. That this film would have affected me more. It is close to being as good as the original but does not have the advantage of coming first.Grade: B.,Funny Games
82,SilverOrlov,Just a clone,3,21 June 2018,"This is not just a remake of the old film, but a trivial exact copy. Up to the poses and replicas. So, in my opinion, does not deserve to be rated higher than just for the work done on the film's shooting, not for the film itself.",Funny Games
83,michaelradny,A Fantastic Idea Without A Fantastic Picture,8,3 May 2011,"I was looking forward to this film for a very long time. I finally got around to watching it and it most certainly disappointed me. I'm not saying this movie was a complete flop, but it wasn't what I was expecting. The camera has limited movement throughout and this just creates a still image throughout the film. When this happens the movie becomes still and boring without a moment of conflict.Then we go to the characters. The acting is great, but the characters are frustrating and annoying when it comes to escapes and main conflict. The young boy is almost certainly the worst with personality, but when it comes to the parents, you just want to kill them yourself.The last thing is the confusing storyline of the movie. Half the time you don't know what is going on and when the guy reverses time with the remote control just throws you right off. I finally got the movie after watching two hours of it but only after reading hundreds of reviews and peoples comments to it.In conclusion, the filming of the movie would be a 5/10, the acting would be a 7/10, the storyline a 5/10, and the overall rating a 6/10. Unfortunately this movie could be 100% better then it is but that is what another remake is for. The last thing is ""I wish this was more like the original, unfortunately the original is in German"". And that concludes this review.Michael N. Radny",Funny Games
84,Jacques98,Don't listen to the things it is tagged with.,8,30 August 2008,"Movies rarely reach the originality of lesser-known video games like Killer 7 (PS2) and No More Heroes (Wii). Kill Bill, for example, was an okay movie, but it looks lame and raped of everything that made it intelligent or original compared to Killer 7. Funny Games gives me the same vibe. It's good for a movie, but compared to No More Heroes (which uses similar plotting and storytelling devices, but 100x more effectively with insanely more action), it is nothing even slightly special. I think that is why I can't give this movie a perfect rating, even though I'm very tempted to.The other main problem I had was it had literally no action or scares. There were a lot of points where I was so bored I was about to turn it off. But maybe that was the point. Best line in the movie: ""Would you like this to end now, or be more typical with an ending with some plot devilment?"" So maybe boring was what the director was going for.After hearing people say stuff like, ""This is the most disturbing movie ever made!"" I was very disappointed with the level of actually disturbing scenes. *SPOILERS* They kill a kid and a dog.*END SPOILERS* Sorry, but compared to a man getting his head shot out as he holds the severed head of his daughter (from Killer 7, as I referenced before), Funny Games just looks cute, not disturbing. I don't understand why children are put on such a high pedestal and the second they get killed off in a movie it's automatically ""unfair"" or ""not playing by the rules"". So don't expect this to be as disturbing as the critics are saying because it simply isn't.The other main problem is the ""social commentary"", which people are claiming this has. If so, the argument against violence is simply dumb and been done hundreds of times. That said, I'm not sure Funny Games tried to deliver a social cometary as much as explore one.Overall, a very good movie but far from perfect. It fails to deliver originality and fails to be disturbing, both which it is tagged with. But like everything else that's the critics fault more than the director's. Very much worth watching.7/10",Funny Games
85,dallasryan,"To Skip or Not to Skip, that is the question",8,24 January 2012,"I was once kidnapped and I use to imagine if I were ever put in a situation like that, that I would be the hero, fight back, do something. But that wasn't the case, I just froze and thought 'this started out as a simple little misunderstanding and I'll be out of here soon.' But that wasn't the case, the kidnapping kept getting worse and worse to where I heard my kidnapper debate whether to kill me or not which at that point I thought 'How did it get to this point, I can't believe this is happening.' The whole situation just came out of nowhere and escalated to a level I could have never fathomed. My kidnapper ended up letting me go. But the whole time, I was frozen, very scared, in shock, not at all how I imagined I would react. So Funny Games kind of hits a chord with me in the sense that it is shown in a very 'real documentary' type sense. Where you want the family who's being held hostage to fight back, but they don't, only at one point do they really. They don't though just as I didn't, and I believe they don't because they're scared and they just hope these guys will let them go if they stay cool, as is what I thought as well. So Funny Games demonstrates almost a very real 'what if' scenario, what would 'really' happen if you were put in this type of situation. The turning point for the family is that there abductors tell them they are going to kill them. And the family that's being held hostage has the same reaction I felt when I found out that I might die. 'How did it get to this, we just want them to go away, how did it get to this point? I can't die like this, not like this'. Funny Games is a great movie in its 'real time' sense, the acting is just unbelievable and because of the real sense of the movie, Michael Pitt plays one of the most creepy, sadistic bad guys in film history. He's scary to watch he's so good in this part. Pitt is one of the few actors who can play the likable happy guy, a stupid stoner, a genius and then one of the most hateful villains. He is one of the best actors out there, very underrated. From the Director's track record, it is my hypothesis, that this movie is also a bit of an experiment. The bad guys are the Sadists in the movie as the family are the Masochists, lots of humiliation, and we, as the movie viewer, are also the masochist or are we? I'm one to believe that every human being is shy at some point, it just depends on the situation, where as I believe we all have a little bit of a sadist and masochist in all of us. However, there are people out there that are painfully shy all the time, it's part of their attitude pretty much. Same goes for a Sadist and a Masochist. Funny Games is almost a barometer to tell you whether you are a Sadist or not. I say that, knowing that most of us will identify with the family so we can't help but having emotions evoked from us of feeling humiliation with what the family is going through, and that's just being human. But if a viewer was to identify with Pitt's character, and they get off on the torture, then they're a die-hard Sadist. And if a viewer got off on the humiliation, like really got off on it, then I would say they are a die-hard Masochist. Funny Games is not the easiest movie to watch by far, in fact it is very, very disturbing, more disturbing than the Hostel movies, or most bad guys in films that are antagonizing the protagonist in a creepy way, and that's mainly due to the performance of Pitt and the humiliation that he and his partner bestow upon the family. If you have a strong stomach, I would recommend watching it once, but if you're not a 'diehard' film buff or you can't take such disturbing humiliation, then you probably want to skip this one.",Funny Games
86,TheVictoriousV,Currently my favorite Haneke film,10,15 January 2019,"Few directors seize power over the frame so wholly as Austrian genius Michael Haneke. Every actor on the screen (minuscule extras not excluded), every shot that encompasses said actors, and even what is done during post-production; all of it is scrupulous like only Haneke knows how, yet never in a way wherein he simply shows off. Mind you, his perfection doesn't end on the technical level.With Funny Games, his own shot-for-shot, set-for-set remake of his similarly named German-language film from 1997, he has again made sure to get the best out of the actors (this film reminded me how much I truly love Naomi Watts) and tell a story most gut-wrenching and brazen. Conventional thrillers (a genre of which Haneke's film is in many ways critical) are never up to par with anything in this movie.It is convincing and realistic, but at just the right time, Haneke does something; something that drives the point home of how he regards modern film violence, its fanboys, and their expectations. It would be a crime for me to reveal any more than that.Haneke has never been a fan of adding non-diegetic music to his films, as he finds that film scores are more often than not used manipulatively. Funny Games, however, starts on a cheerful family driving down a country road, listening to classical tunes that are suddenly interrupted by the loudest and most garish metal you can imagine, obviously added in post and not remotely matching the imagery. What would surely be jarring in any other film, here works as foreshadowing for what sort of evil is about to disrupt the Farber family's life. It could very well be a statement on the art of scoring, too.At their secluded lake mansion, Ann Farber (Watts), her husband George (Tim Roth) and their son Georgie live in peace, even as their neighbors start behaving a bit strangely. They are visited by a dapper-looking but dim-witted boy named Peter (Brady Corbet) and his more sharp-headed brother Paul (Michael Pitt), who claim to know the neighbors. Showing hospitality at first, Ann becomes irritated at their requests for some eggs, which they keep breaking on the way out, and the damage they deal to the house phone on accident. ""Accident"".The dialogue grows more and more uncomfortable, until Haneke finally unleashes the two brothers and shows their true nature. Funny Games has been called an exercise in sadism, though it is not without purpose. The movie is intended for a certain brand of horror and thriller fan. There is a reason the character of Michael Pitt so often seems to smirk at them.Even as a purely sadistic film, I would find it admirable. Haneke is not one to pull his punches (just watch his depiction of sexual desperation in The Piano Teacher), hence the violence in this movie is relentlessly evil, on top of being so inordinately real-looking. This is aided, again, by the convincing special effects, lighting, make-up and performances, including those of even the smallest supporting actors. (NOTE: For the most part the violence is actually not seen, yet in spite of this fact, or perhaps because of it, the film is upsetting enough to be rightly rated R!)Just to reiterate, Haneke is a matchless perfectionist. This auteur spends almost as much time directing extras as he does the main actors, never relies on CGI or manipulative music, and made people learn to play the piano for authenticity's sake during filming of Piano Teacher. The latter film, by the way, is a knife-twisting character study filled with even bolder content than Funny Games - ""Fifty Shades for grown-ups"" I saw someone call it.Still, Funny Games is currently my favorite Haneke movie. I haven't actually seen the original Funny Games, although I'm told this one makes improvements. Either way, it's that one thing that Haneke does towards the end, where he shatters the fabric of this fictional universe and breaks the rules in a way that would ruin the immersion in any other movie, that takes this one to an additional level for me. All of his films are brutally real, but this time the realism is offset in an absolute master stroke.",Funny Games
87,homecoming8,Turns out to be a major disappointment !,4,6 June 2011,"I only saw this one yesterday. Because of a bad review I didn't see it 3 years ago. But the story interested me enough to watch it, as well as the cast. The acting/characters are very divided: Naomi Watts (""The Ring"") is excellent as usual, she plays her part very well. Michael Pitt is very creepy. But he already played a similar part in ""Murder By Numbers"". Tim Roth's character was very weak, the story was better if he wasn't in it. He gets kneecapped once with a golf club in the beginning and lies on the floor the entire time. The little son is also badly written and not a good actor. But the whole family is kind of passive here, you're telling me there wasn't a single moment when they could have stopped these 2 young boys ? For most of the time they weren't even armed ! They kill their son (off screen) and later on Roth's character (also off screen). Watt's character is given a chance to free herself on the boat but that doesn't happen either. You expect to see some action/revenge like ""Last House On The Left"" or ""I Spit on your Grave"". But the story slowly bleeds to death without any gore or action whatsoever. Which really kills the movie here is that when she suddenly shoots one of the killers, the other one takes the remote control of the TV and rewinds that scene as it didn't happen at all. Come one, how lame was that ?? There was also no psychological motivation for their actions. They make Watt's take off her clothes for 30 seconds and than she has to dress herself again. How stupid is that ? You expect that she'll fight back at any given chance (there were enough opportunities) but it doesn't happen at all. ""The Strangers"" which was released a year later, was way better. Even classics like ""The House On The Edge Of The Park"" are perfect (and more realistic) than this weak attempt. I never saw the original and I am not going to.""Funny Games"" has some good points (mostly Watt's performance) but the story sinks like the Titanic.",Funny Games
88,pinkliz41,Painful to watch,1,29 July 2008,"Funny Games U.S. as you might know is a remake of the 1997 horror film and is directed by the same person- Michael Haneke. The plot is that two young men take a mother, father and son hostage whilst on vacation in their cabin and force them to play sadistic 'games'. As the film progresses the different types of 'games' become more violent and horrific. The one major, and biggest fault in this film was the slow pacing of certain scenes that took literally twenty five minutes.An example of one of these scenes is where Ann (Watts) is trying to get up and move to the kitchen but she cant because her arms and legs have been taped up. So here we have at least a ten minute scene of just looking at Ann trying to get. She eventually makes it the kitchen to find a knife and cuts herself free. After doing so Ann accompanies her injured husband (Roth) who has broken his leg after it being whacked by one of the men using a golf club. She moves him into the kitchen, where Ann then searches for a phone to call the police, but the phone had been pushed in the sink earlier on in the film. And so they both try fixing the phone which takes a further ten minutes. They don't succeed. Ann then climbs out the kitchen window to look for a pair of pliers in a greenhouse resulting in another five to ten minutes of slow and boring camera work.All in all Funny Games U.S. is a severe failure and a painful movie experience which is let down mainly due to poor direction.",Funny Games

Soon his friend Paul (Michael Pitt) joins them, and the family soon finds themselves in a battle of wills and survival as they kidnap them and hold them hostage inside their own home.""Funny Games"" isn't your typical 'home invasion' movie. Kudos goes to Corbett and Pitt, who give chilling, strictly monotone performances that reminds me of ""A Clockwork Orange."" They're not your typical home invaders - they're polite, intelligent and incessantly ruthless. Basically they're the epitome of evil incarnate.Another thing I liked about this film is the breaking of the 'fourth wall,' when Paul would look at the camera and talk to us as the audience, telling us we're probably on the family's side and stuff like that. I found that incredibly refreshing, but there's one scene that also breaks the mold in movies that I didn't care for, and you'll know it when you get to it.All in all, ""Funny Games"" is a deep, profound psychological thriller that some may see as slow, but others see as building up the suspense. You're drawn into the story, and thanks to the fourth wall breaking, you feel like you're a part of the film itself.",Funny Games

Before she agreed to go she asked me what ""Funny Games"" was about. I told her ""Funny Games"" was a foreign thriller concerning a nice, affluent, middle class couple, with a pre-teen son, who are taken hostage in their house by a pair of psychopaths. That was everything I could crib from the reviews of ""Funny Games"" I had read at the time. My Girlfriend was game, so off we went.A couple of hours later, emerging shell shocked and ashen faced from the cinema, my Girlfriend turned to me and this is what she said.""If you EVER"" (big emphasis on the word EVER, here guys) ""take me to see a film like that again, we won't be going out together anymore.

Probably just as well.A comparison between ""Funny Games"" and ""Funny Games U.S."" would be pretty futile, because they are practically the same movie. Word for word, scene for scene and shot for shot, but what a brilliant, shocking, gruelling and uncompromising piece of work it still is.I loved ""Funny Games U.S."" for exactly the same reasons that I loved the original. The unbroken ratcheting up of the tension and unexpected lack of release. The subverting of the very language of cinema. (Blatant acknowledgement of the ""fourth wall"" and, hey!, if you don't like the way a scene is going, why not just rewind and start again?) The way that the worst of the violence is just slightly off screen. What did you see? What did they do? It's an old trick, but it is still very effective.As for the ending? Almost written as an afterthought. Indifferent, unimportant and devastating.Frankly I feared what might happen to ""Funny Games U.S."" in the hands of Hollywoodian style producers and actors, even with Michael Haneke still in the Director's chair, but I needn't have worried. There are astonishing performances by everybody in the cast, but no better than the performances of Michael Pitt as a twinkly eyed charming lunatic, and Naomi Watts, digging deep into reserves of hysterical emotion and appearing to really suffer.""Funny Games U.S."" does lose out slightly to the original, but only because it is practically the same movie as the one I saw in 1997 and so I knew exactly where the plot was going, but it is still an astonishing piece of work.Much recommended, but do not go to see if you are expecting a generic family-in-peril thriller.",Funny Games
91,tigerfish50,Snuffed Out by a Director's Ego,1,19 August 2010,"The conventions of 'home invasion' movies are familiar to most film-goers, where God-fearing families are menaced by rapacious escaped convicts, outlaw bikers, foreign terrorists or some other variety of depraved miscreants. A sophisticated audience is well aware the barbarians will eventually be repulsed, followed by the family restoring order by cementing their unity. However, in ""Funny Games"" director Haneke chooses to overturn the genre's accepted rituals with the complacent vanity of a self-certified avant-garde virtuoso.The film opens with George and Ann bickering irritably as they drive their son Georgie Jnr towards a prosperous coastal vacation community in a gas-guzzling SUV. The traditional nubile teenage daughter is mysteriously absent, but 30-something wife and mother Ann possesses all the required attributes of feminine vulnerability. After they arrive at their holiday home, the audience's brows might furrow briefly when two effete Ralph Lauren clones drop by to borrow some eggs, but the visitors' sinister intent is glaringly obvious even though the family remains stubbornly blind to the imminent danger. Ominous incidents follow: the family's loyal golden retriever disappears . . boundaries are transgressed . . tensions rise . . until the scoundrels' civilized veneer is stripped away by a sudden flurry of violence.The preppy pillagers have little interest in theft or thrill-seeking - their activities are simply an escape from boredom. No doubt the film is an allegory about Western Civilization devoured from within, but it's overloaded with relentless nastiness and ostentatious irony. Naomi Watts can't help giving Ann some depth, but the other characters are mere symbols - the family is too doggedly stupid, and the villains are too theatrically villainous to allow the film to be truly disturbing. The viewer's role is to be a passive admirer of Haneke's display of intellectual virility - but unfortunately ""Funny Games"" is nothing more than shallow ideas floating upon heaving swells of egotism.",Funny Games
92,Siamois,"Decent as a movie, poor as an exercise...",5,19 August 2008,"Before I begin my less-than-glowing review of this passable film I should point out that yes, I know Haneke and have seen all his movies but one. I would qualify him as a better than average filmmaker. This movie (either version) is not one of his best, in my not so humble opinion.We should first point out the good: Haneke usually gets nuanced and interesting performances out of his actor. This is the case here and frankly, Haneke probably never had a more brilliant cast for one of his movies. None of the performances are particularly engrossing, none would qualify as a career high yet all are good enough to immerse us in this story (with the exception of the kid, but to find kid actors that could play in such an intense movie is difficult enough that this flaw can be overlooked) As well, the direction, photography, pacing, etc... are all fine. Some people will complain that certain scenes are a bit long, or that the tension throughout the film is uneven but to the patient film enthusiast, I don't think that's the case. Likewise, the static shots might unnerve the MTV generation but frankly, everything here is filmed efficiently.So what's the problem? The story is boring, the characters are clichés and Haneke's heavy-handed attempt at a thought-provoking work of art comes off as an adolescent effort at best. I think Haneke wanted to make a movie that would appeal both to the Hollywood audience and fans of artsy flicks. This is an ambitious goal but unfortunately, he fails on both fronts.One suspects that, if not for Haneke's name, this movie would already be forgotten and no remake would have been shot. I realize that this review will probably not appeal to Haneke and Funny Games enthusiasts but still, for those who enjoyed the movie, I would strongly recommend Olivier Assayas' Demonlover. It is a much stronger and elegant effort that achieves pretty much what Funny Games was trying to do, and then some.All in all, to say Funny Games is trash would be missing the point. But to hail it as a masterpiece is equally shortsighted. This is an OK movie, that could and should be rated everywhere from a 4 to a 6. And I give it a honest 5.",Funny Games

94,sitenoise,"Nothing wrong, very good, but the original is better ... if you've seen it.",8,2 June 2008,"This is a shot for shot remake by the same director of the 1997 film. It didn't strike me being as slimy or as creepy as the original, probably because I knew the story, Naomi Watts is too beautiful, and Michael Pitt's shorts weren't short enough.Pitt and Corbet did do a stand up job, as good as the original duo, which was a pleasant surprise, but Roth and Watts, while good, didn't seem as terrorized as the original pair of vacationers. Maybe Tim Roth's resume precludes a requisite suspension of disbelief.My vote is for the original and I'd recommend it over this one unless you don't like subtitles. Both films are very good, but for American audiences I think it adds to the effect if the characters are unfamiliar. It's definitely a film worth seeing. The bad guys are a unique and surreal experience in terror.As I wrote in my comment on the original: All the pretentious talk about ""making a film that sends a clear message about violence, and the audience's view and involvement with violence on film"" or ""a deconstruction in the way violence is portrayed in the media"" is (utter and complete) NONSENSE. Where does that kind of silly talk come from? There is nothing didactic or pedantic about this film. It is terror for terror's sake.",Funny Games
95,tequila101,"Charming, yet really Sadistic",8,28 September 2012,"When I saw this film, my expectations were a little low, but once seeing the strong actors, tension-building scenes and excellent moments, I knew I was in for an excellent horror film.I am aware that this is a 2007 remake which only came 10 years after the original from 1997. A little silly to do a remake only 10 years after? But then again Carrie is getting another remake, only 11 years after the TV version from 2002. I haven't seen the original yet, and I will do so soon. Since I have not seen it, I will not be making a comparison between the original and remake.I thought that the story was like any other however, it showed elements and a tone of disturbance that I had not encountered in a horror film for a long time. Over the time this year, I had not really encountered a horror film as sadistic or as sad or even as suspenseful as this in such a long time. The characters were different, they acted differently and their moods, qualities and characteristics variously changed throughout the course of the film.I believe Naomi Watts and Tim Roth were very believable in their roles throughout the film as they show to be a normal, very civilised family who want to live in peace and harmony. When they are attacked and keep them as hostage in their own house, they show the emotional sides of how they are feeling and it shows what they are like, if they imagined to be free again. Even though I've seen the two actors in other films, I thought that Michael Pitt who played as Paul and Brady Corbet as Peter (who I haven't seen before in films), I found to be the key stars of the entire film. They were charming, yet really sadistic in what they did with their characters as they showed their nice, well-mannered tones slowly changing to slightly manipulative and aggressive tones. I thought that they did excellent in their roles.An excellent element in the film I found quite special was that there was no music. There would only be this weird, quite absurdly cool heavy rock tune playing at the start, middle and end. I liked that a lot as it gave the film an absurd look and feel.I did think that the scene where the boys rewind the scene was dumb. Peter gets shot and then Paul rewinds it back to make him supposedly be back in reality. And then they chuck Ann (Naomi Watts) in a lake, killing her. I thought a much more intriguing ending would be that Peter dies, then Paul takes Ann on the boat, and then the ending we see, would be taken forth. I thought that would have been a much more superior ending instead of ruining it with that silly scene which ruins half of that tension that was built throughout most of the film.However, I think that the silly little mistake doesn't make me hate that film a bit. I thought that it was a good film with excellent actors, great suspense and good twists.The film was charming, yet really Sadistic. 7.5/10",Funny Games
96,zfiany,Those are the movies my friend!,8,16 September 2009,"As I said in previous reviews, this is the kind of movies I do like and enjoy the most. The movies that makes you think about so many meanings in life. Movies like The Killing Room, The Killing Gene (WAZ), and Funny Games U.S.This particular kind of movies makes you ask yourself what is right and what is wrong in life. Is this or that the right thing to do or this is what supposed to be done? It's really one of the toughest question that nobody has the answer to. Only religions and laws dared to specify what is right and what is wrong but out of the context of those two, who can say what is right and what is wrong.The movie also talks smartly about politeness which means nothing. Someone can be very polite and a criminal at the same time and though he commits murders and crimes, still you cannot say the person is not polite. The movie brilliantly separates between politeness and murder (God just so smart!) Amazing acting from all parties and again a movie that is shot in one room where all the horror takes place. The ending is as smart as the whole movie is and the conversation between the two guys on the boat is just so philosophically and crazily true.Just a perfect intellectual movie that you won't underrate no matter what!",Funny Games

98,littlemartinarocena,The Haneke Factor,8,25 August 2009,"The masochist side to my personality saw both versions of Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" and like them. Well ""like"" may not be the right word but let me tell you that I couldn't shake those images out of my mind for days. It happened the same with Haneke's last film ""The White Ribbon"" as well as with ""Cache"" and in particular with ""The Piano Teacher"" I'm fascinated by Michael Haneke but I don't trust him. I'm aware of his brilliance just as aware as he is. There is a self consciousness about his work that strips it of any form of innocence. That's very disturbing. Luis Bunuel felt triumphant when people fainted or vomited during his films but, in his case, it was clear where he was coming from. Ingman Bergman's purity couldn't have allow him to do a film like ""Funny Games"", Haneke made it, twice. An artist or a con man? I think both but that in itself is not that unusual, what is unusual is that the con is so rivetingly perpetrated. The ending of his film may provoke in you the desire to throw something at the screen and curse, curse very loudly. But, and here is where the con really works, I found myself wanting to see his films again. What's wrong with me? I think the answer is that I love film and Michael Heneke revisits some of my favorite filmmakers and does to them what the home invaders do to the family of ""Funny Games"" Extraordinary in as many ways as it is appalling.

101,movieswithgreg,Brilliant variation of a creep show,7,1 September 2016,"I was fortunate to see the Austrian original version of this movie by complete accident. It was broadcast by my PBS station as a Saturday night special. I knew nothing about it beforehand. I couldn't take my eyes off of it from beginning to end. Part of that was because it was in Austrian or German subtitles, so I was forced to watch it if I wanted to get the dialogue. The other reason my eyes were glued to it was because it was so understatedly unnerving in the young psychos' cool, low-key, hyper verbal demeanor. This American re-make, by the same director of the Austrian original, supposedly is identical, shot for shot. I don't remember the original well enough to verify that. The last time that was done by Gus van zant in PSYCHO, I thought it felt inorganic. This remake is a film many love to bash. I sorta get that, sorta don't. Where they complain about the director flipping off the audience, I like that angle that sometimes occurs when a European filmmaker is making a film set in America, and addresses American values, or lack thereof, one way or another. In that classic euro style, the director here is being vague, but not frustratingly obtuse or av-ant-garde. His theme is impotence. Not any sort of American impotence, (more on that to follow), but of a melange of suburban white entitled privileged assumption. Assumption that people like them, in their surroundings, will never be so viscerally threatening. Assumption that bad men don't look nor act just like you; that such bad men are ""those people,"" not ""we people."" Perhaps the filmmaker also threw in a few worn golden oldie stylizations that begged the viewer to yell at the screen -- ""why don't you do THIS !? Why don't you do THAT!? NOW, dummy! What's WRONG with you losers?!""On a shallower, more direct, more obvious level, there's this simple cautionary tale -- keep your cell phone on your body. Have a ""Plan A"" on how to deal with simple physical assaults. Have a weapon on you or mentally rehearse in advance how to identify and gather weapons.Has anyone in this movie heard of a knife? Pepper spray? Hammer? Have simple first aid protocols available. And when someone feels wrong, then act early and decisively. To those who do this, it seems like everyone knows this. For those who don't, it seems like no one ever needs to know this stuff. Why is this a good film? It's a coffeehouse flick. It makes you want to leave the theater, head to a coffeehouse, and talk about what you just saw with your movie mate. There's many potential layers in this, partially because, in the blessed European style of semi- blank canvases, you as the viewer are invited to fill in your own interpretations. I don't even remember soundtrack music being used in this film. Other than that, there's ""just enough "" style here. There's not obvious stylistic gimmicks, no overt visual ""look"" to this, no visual games. It's a little Hitchcock, but not too much. One tasty coffeehouse topic -- contrast and compare with STRAW DOGS, the British 1971 original with a young still-forming Dustin Hoffman, where he starts out a schmuck, and ends up a monster. This film is a kind of anti-straw dogs. It denies you that predictable satisfaction of turnaround. Acting -- Michael Pitt is fine as the chatty psycho Richie rich country club poster boy. Tim Roth is the underplaying impotent (see how that word keeps coming up?) husband, sans the usual cinematic affectations of overt wimpiness or obvious weakness. Naomi Watts is the suffering female victim star, a role she's done before in many variants. OK, now for the third act that has so many reviewers chewing on their toes with disapproval. Yes, the actors talk to the camera. Yes, there's an unexpected video gimmick that makes viewers feel used and cheap. But c'mon, be honest -- how many times has a movie made fun of you, the viewer, without being a mockudramatic faux- horror spoof? Well, this one does. And it does it without being stupid, corny, or pranky. Oh yeah, about the rest on American impotence. There's a popular sentiment from non- Americans that it's fun sport to poke holes in American self images of how tough we are, how resourceful we are, how comfortable with violence as a solution we are, blah blah. Sometimes it's a welcome reminder, sometimes it's dreary and boring and immature. Some movie viewers just can't take a joke unless it's wearing a sandwich board.",Funny Games
102,robertallenandersonjr,One of the most unique and twisted movies ever,8,10 April 2008,"Funny Games was of the most twisted movies I have ever seen. It was so weird the way they made this movie. This movie was twisted but yet kind of sad at the same time. It was very real. Going into this movie I didn't think it would be as real as it was. Some of the camera angle shots in this movie were interesting. They had certain shots for like 5 minutes on the same shot. The acting in this movie were very well played. Paul who was one of the bad guys did a great job especially. I loved how he smiled at the camera a couple times. He said to the audience in one scene your on their side aren't you, as in the victims. The last half hour of the movie was pretty boring. It took some great twists and was surprising. Some of the things in this movie you didn't see coming. I thought that it was well made though. All of the violence in this movie was pretty much off screen. The whole time you couldn't help but to laugh. At the same time though you shouldn't be laughing. If you think about it and that was you, would you want people laughing at you. You begin to really hate the killers in this movie. They were very funny in the movie though. This was a very unique and good movie. Some of the people that write reviews for this movie are idiots. They need to know going into this movie that it's not going to be a family movie. It wasn't as bad as people make it sound. If anything it was very good. I would watch this movie again for sure. Nobody in my theatre walked out like other people say they did. The story to this movie was very unique. I liked how they really didn't copy off of any movies at all. Such as some movies like Juno. Some of the scenes in this movie will make you very mad. I think that this is a type of movie that you either love or hate. For me I liked it a lot. It pretty much kept you on the edge of your seat. The movie really keeps you hanging at the end. I was rooting for the victims the whole movie. It's not like this movie will win any awards or anything. All and all this was a very great movie.

105,Billy_Crash,Not Close Enough,7,27 July 2010,"Haneke's shot-by-shot remake of his 1997 Austrian film, establishes the Farber family as a trio of well-off Americans residing in a gated vacation house – and who go about their normal business when a snotty, Eddie Haskell-esquire kid comes in and asks for eggs. Afterwards, the story tailspins into a hellish, tension-filled story of emotional and physical sadism. The always more than capable Naomi Watts plays Ann Farber, Tim Roth is her impotent husband, George and Devon Gearheart delivers a stellar performance as their young son. Michael Pitt with his still boyish looks and Brady Corbet his sidekick in mayhem, malice and murder, portray ever-smiling serial killers.On occasion Paul addresses the audience directly, which was extremely distracting. Haneke may have done this simply to taunt the audience, to let us know without a doubt that we were incapable of reaching through the screen to help the family. By rewinding the scene, the family and audience is deprived of any victory over the situation and its villains. In effect, Haneke is telling us we simply must suffer the experience. Worst still, Paul tells us that they leave the family for a while to create dramatic tension and the movie has to be given time to reach ""feature length"". Near the end, Peter and Paul discuss the gray line between fiction and reality. Haneke is asking the question: ""Does life imitate art or does art imitate life?"" Either way, Peter and Paul are the disciples that bring us the message of violence, as Peter and Paul brought Christianity to Rome.Many of the scenes were long, but they added to the tension and were not boring by any means. In some scenes which appeared to be too dark, such as when George Junior is running and hiding in a neighbor's home, I found myself looking for Paul coming after him – George could not see him and neither could the audience, until Haneke deemed it necessary. There was only one setup (the knife falling into the boat) that was later used to taunt the audience with another avenue of false hope near story's end.With Haneke's commentary on fiction/reality and violence in film/life, he also removes ""the man of the house"" or ""captain"" from the equation. After Peter breaks his leg with a golf club, George Farber is left impotent and cannot save his son or his wife. When his wife prepares to leave the home in search of help after their son is killed, he says, ""Please forgive me"". Afterwards, he is left with the chore of holding a hair dryer to a wet cellphone. Even here, he fails and can not get a call out to the police. As George was emasculated, so are the men in the audience, for we are also impotent and cannot save anyone. Haneke may be asking all males: As men, whom can you really save? I am not sure if he is asking us as men to stand up to violence in our lives, or if he is just taunting for taunting's sake. From ""Films as Catharsis"", Haneke does state that his films ""are intended  for provocation and dialogue instead of consumption and consensus"". This means there may be no right answers except in the minds of those taking part in the discussion.A couple of things are puzzling, however. Initially, the family seems to have little reaction to the young invaders. Fight or flight is virtually absent and they stand around in awe of the finally dressed young men. This may be because they are not used to violence and never expected anything to happen to them in their own home in such a well-established and wealthy lake community. They met ""the uncanny"" and were left with an inactive, wide-eyed response. When leaving the house, Ann does not take a knife to defend herself, and she runs out onto the road where she is ultimately recaptured. Knowing the killers left in the SUV, which was the only vehicle, why did she not try the boat first?Regarding the uncanny, Haneke has the camera following the Farbers around the house, focusing attention on what they own, from golf clubs to shoes, and gives us an inside look at their refrigerator. Though nothing horrific happens in this sequence, we are left with an unsettling feeling that was is normal and mundane will enter the realm of the uncanny. The inciting incident has to do with the dropping of eggs and the verbal altercation and attitudes that follow. Then, a golf club becomes a weapon to kill a dog and break a man's leg. A small kitchen knife is used to torture. Moreover, the phone – the lifeline – is soaked, low on energy and cannot be used to save the family. The two killers appear to be fine men, all in ""good guy"" white, ready for a tennis match; they smile often and are well spoken. Other than the shotgun, simple things we normally find innocuous are turned against the family – from their own home no less.The actors,cinematographer (for providing some off-kilter camera angles, which made it appear as if we were voyeurs) and unyielding tension made the grade. I was not impressed, however, with Paul playing to the audience, regardless of Haneke's intentions, because this extracted us from the uncanny world he had fought so hard to create. Most importantly, Haneke failed to deliver something new. But Haneke did deliver in creating elements of fear and horror for any homeowner, pet owner, spouse or parent.",Funny Games
106,brettchatz-1,Riveting,7,2 May 2008,"Funny Games (US) is the film of the same name, of yesteryear Europe, presented to an American audience. The celebrated and ever-talented Naomi Watts takes centre stage in this high-octane, low-budget thriller.The premise is simple: a middle-class family enjoys a getaway at their lakeside home. A seemingly pleasant young man enters the property and asks for some eggs. He is soon joined by his obstreperous 'brother' and the games begin.There is nothing funny about Funny Games; it is a jarring spectacle, fraught with horror. The film hardly glorifies gore and murder  these scenes are alluded to and not actually splashed across the screen  but it does explore the psychotic ramblings of a pair of twisted, sadistic killers  in graphic detail.The film itself is captivating; the audio and visual scenes comprising the total package make for harrowing viewing. The effects of media and entertainment on the concept of murder and mayhem are central to the film's core. There are extended moments of heightened tension, but overall it is the composure of the psychopathic boys that is most unsettling.If you are a fan of the horror genre, then Funny Games (US) is for you, but it's certainly not for the faint of heart.",Funny Games

There was no letting on what was behind every corner and you dared not peak for fear that it would only hasten the inevitable.Disappointingly, 2007's ""Funny Games US"" was merely the same film, but with a new cast and in English. Sure, for those that have never seen the original, this version will sting. But in comparison to the original, which tears into the viewer's susceptibility like a dull, rusty, jagged blade of an old buoy knife dragged across bare shoulders, the new take pales miserably in comparison.I have nothing against remakes and normally do not draw much comparison, but when a film mimics its source as closely as this, it demands comparison. This version's bad guys aren't sinister enough, crazy enough, apathetic enough, psycho enough... As wonderful as Naomi Watts is to gaze upon, she was miscast here (and we didn't even see her nekkid!). Tim Roth's talent was wasted in a role with too little dialog. It made me angry to watch him whimper about and the infliction of his wounds just didn't seem to warrant his uselessness.Here is just another example of Hollywood attempting to cash in on an International film's success.

109,andell,Almost Immoral in its Coldness and Humor!,3,1 April 2008,"Today I went to the movies to see ""Funny Games,"" an apparent shot for shot remake of an Austrian film produced ten years or so earlier which I also didn't see. I suppose its supporters will claim its a 'black comedy/horror.' I must admit, I am not one of these supporters. In fact, when I left the theater, I found myself feeling an overwhelming sense of disgust with both the film maker and the audience! Of course, I will get to more specifics on this, but for now, lets focus on the story.This film is about a husband and wife, and their young son going to what appears to be their rather lavish riverside home, unaware as they drive past their friends that there are a pair of degenerates who are terrorizing the community, one family at a time.The sociopaths, Paul and Peter, are a pair of soft spoken blonde haired guys who one would expect to see living in these mansions- who knows, perhaps they do. Either way, there isn't any kind of substantive catalyst to the horrors they unleash aside from a patronizing determination to 'remain civil' at the expense of their victims dignity, right until they reveal their true intents.This story could have had a lot to say, and indeed, some of the technicals of this film are quite effective. This director knows how to ratchet up the suspense, to prod his audience into a state of near catatonia, however ultimately the effectiveness of both the story of the wolf in sheep's clothing and the quality of some of the film making becomes saturated in a need to demean and torture would be victims.Case in point: in a scene where the two villains are debating the quality of the female victim's body, they decide they want her to take her clothes off- and to effect this, they stick a sack over her son's head and twist it to the point that these rather loud screams of pain and anguish can be heard. Imagine my absolute horror when members of the audience, and in particular, female members of the audience, could be heard laughing hysterically.While I write this, I think I've concluded that the thing that I find most unsatisfying is the degree that the villains manipulate pretty much everything that happens in this story. You see, there's nothing particularly intelligent about them...just condescending and fake! There's nothing physically impressive about either of them: indeed I had hoped and still believe that someone like Tim Roth could've throttled them to within an inch of their lives, golf club or not! But on a couple of occasions there is an acknowledgment of their omnipotent control of everything and anything that I found just so inappropriate and ridiculous in this story.For instance, at one point one of the characters talks directly to the camera (and of course, by extension, us); at another, one of the characters when the victims rise up (as one would naturally expect after they KILLED THEIR LITTLE BOY!!!) manages to rewind the action when it is unfavorable, and alter it so that the husband is shot dead, and the wife is bound and dropped into the lake.And then we have the ending. But guess what: as the audience, I kinda feel like it was MY right to alter the action, and not that of one of those nothings who unleashed their horror! Therefore, I'd like to go back to the scene where there is a confrontation with these two over the eggs, and have the husband take his driver and knock both of their heads off BEFORE they get to kill the little boy.To summarize: privileged young devils torture and kill a family. That really is all this film is about, and whilst it can hide behind its ""uniqueness,"" truth is there is nothing unique here. Its not as gory as ""Hostel,"" but its main purpose for being barks up the exact same tree! A tree that, as it grows, says less about our own world, and more about us! I'd recommend passing on this one!",Funny Games
110,Ben-Hibburd,Funny Games Review.,5,22 August 2017,"Why does this film exist? Michael Haneke re-adapts his 1997 German film of the same name. This version of Funny Games is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original, much in the same way Gus Van Sant re-shot Hitchcock's Psycho. It offers absolutely nothing new, except for better quality visuals, as this film had a higher budget then the original.Funny Games sees a family being sadistically tortured for no reason by two young random psychopaths they come across during their holiday at their tranquil lakeside holiday home. Now I wasn't a big fan of the original film, whilst it wasn't terrible I just couldn't get into it. I also don't buy into the films 'subtext' at all. I found Haneke's argument that the film is supposed to be an indictment of medias increasing obsession of violence to be incredibly flimsy at best. However what I did like about his views on the original film, was the complete and utter pointlessness of it. It makes the events far more scarier when there are no reasons given as to why the these horrific events are happening.The same goes for the re-make as-well, I've given both films the same score as they both do the same thing. The original definitely felt more visceral and raw. The only thing this film Improves upon is the cinematography, and that's about it. Naomi Watts and Tim Roth do a good job in their roles of the two abused parents. Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet are terrific as the two unhinged psychopaths Paul and Peter. So to answer my original question, the only reason I can give for this films existence is: it was made for people who don't like reading subtitles.",Funny Games
111,petit76,the first English languaged artifact of the renowned director,6,2 June 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. For years I have recommended director Michael Haneke's 1997 German version as a sleeper in the creepy, psychological thriller genre. This time Haneke (""Cache"") recreates the film in English, scene by scene, in an attempt to reach a wider audience. And when I say ""reach"", I really mean reach into your head and make you question your outlook! Although I haven't seen the original in a few years, I believe this is a shot by shot remake with well respected actors Tim Roth and Naomi Watts in the leads. The two well-mannered psychos are played here by Brady Corbett and a chilling Michael Pitt (""The Village"", ""Last Days""). Watts and Pitt really make this film work. It is very difficult to watch at times as it reminds us that the worst evil has no conscience. And most of us can't help but put ourselves in the shoes of the ""normal"" victims. How would we react? What would we do differently? How could they let this happen to themselves? As a husband and father, Roth's helplessness is torturous.The best part of this film is listening to the debate going on inside your own head as you watch. Haneke provides so many subtle moments and even adds to the horror by never actually showing any of the killings. The offscreen sounds and moreso, the faces and reactions of the actors tell us more than we want to know. Haneke is renowned for his Opera productions and one can't help but notice the similarities here.Two particular scenes really stand out for me. The opening sequence filmed alternately from above and in the cab of the vehicle complete with a foreshadowing duel between classical music and Marilyn Manson; and the long take of Naomi Watts struggling to get free after the boys first leave the house. Both are unsettling and amazing.Evren Buyruk from Crestline,California USA",Funny Games
112,hughman55,"Movies like this shouldn't be watched, or made.",1,18 December 2016,"There was a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, the Hawke-Petit family, who were similarly tortured, raped, and murdered; mother, two daughters, only the father survived. The two murderers were captured and sentenced to death. With crimes like these, I'm OK with the death penalty, btw. The horror endured by those innocent victims; the mother (raped and strangled), 11 year old daughter (raped and burned alive), 17 year old daughter (raped and burned alive), and the surviving father (beaten nearly to death with a baseball bat), were horrific beyond comprehension. I cannot imagine making a movie about that crime, those victims, the killers, and as this film does, accomplish nothing more than to show you how unimaginable there deaths were and how unrepentant their killers were.This is basically a snuff film but made in Hollywood (the original was German). Like a snuff film it is intended to show a murder, or several, and deliver zero justice. Rather than anyone actually dying a horrible death here though, the director, actors, and crew, get a paycheck and all go home to their peaceful lives.Sociopathic sadists exist and they commit horrendous crimes ending innocent lives in unimaginable ways. It is immoral to deliver horrific violence like this to an audience with so much indifference to the suffering of the victims and rudderless judgment towards the killers. The world just does not function that way.Think of it this way. Someone makes a film about the rape and torture of a child by a grown man. Show all the horror that entails. Toss the child's body into a ditch. And finish the film (remember, this is a movie that someone created) by having the pedophile/rapist/murderer going grocery shopping. That's what this film is. I cannot fathom a person who finds anything redeeming in this film. I know they're out there. I've read their reviews here. And for those who dissect this film over its production values, screenplay, redundancy, fourth wall infractions, etc., I say you're missing the point. None of that matters when the film should not even exist in the first place. It's pure trash.",Funny Games
113,seveleniumus,Better than original in every way,7,28 May 2011,"I watched original and U.S. versions back to back and I'd have to say, that U.S. is better in almost every way. That is in every way possible, for it being a shot-by-shot remake - much better video quality and much better acting (well, maybe except from the boy). I simply felt that performances of the villains in the original just wasn't creepy enough or failed in comparison to the remake and it was not nearly as intense and hard of a sit.So, unnecessary? Yes, of course, shot-by-shot remake almost always will be just a waist of money, but then again, if one would want to watch ""Funny Games"" I would recommend U.S. version.",Funny Games
114,J_Trex,Good Redux of Original,7,16 March 2008,"Too many remakes are awful reproductions of the original. ""Psycho"" comes to mind. But this movie was actually pretty good. The cast was first rate. Tim Roth & Naomi Watts are both great actors and they are excellent in this film. The true stars are the villains, Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet. Pitt was excellent in ""Hedwig & the Angry Inch"" and the under-appreciated ""Bully"". He hasn't appeared in much lately. However, in this role, Pitt played the lead villain with a devious and sly humor, perfectly suited to the character. My guess is this role will help Pitt's career greatly. I think with some very minor editing this film could have been considerably improved. For some strange reason, the Director spent 10 minutes showing Naomi Watts squirming around on the floor trying to free herself. This particular scene got very tiring rather quickly. There were other examples, but I'll skip them for the sake of brevity.Is the American version better than the original? I think so, based on the respective acting of the cast, Pitt in particular. Is this a movie you would want to go see? It's difficult at times and if you get creeped out watching movies like ""Saw"", you might want to steer clear of this. That's not to say this film has the gore quotient of ""Saw""; it doesn't. It's not a slasher film. But the idea of a sociopath torturing his helpless victims, which is central to ""Saw"", is the main plot in this film.",Funny Games
115,Red_Flag,Haneke stunning update of his brilliant original.,8,25 May 2008,"A violent film without any on screen violence. A film where leg wounds mean you can't walk, where daring escapes fail, where victims wet themselves in fear. Just like his crossover stunner's The Piano Teacher and Hidden, Michael Haneke's 1997 chiller Funny Games was never what it appeared to be. And for his first English language film, Haneke gives it to us all over again: a shot-for-shot remake of his original, meticulously reconstructed right down to the last snot-streaked drip of terror.There are some minor updates (most notably as one character ponders his online existence), but the soundtrack, the dialogue, the sets... all the same. A pair of polite sociopaths (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) invade the holiday home of George (Tim Roth), Anna (Naomi Watts) and their son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) and then subject them to a series of sadistic ""games"". But the real funny games aren't between the family and their cherubic torturers. They're between us and Haneke The vacation begins with Anna, George and their son Georgia on their way to their summer home. The neighbours, Fred and Eva, are already there. They make a date to play golf the next morning. It's a perfect day.Anna begins to make dinner, while her husband and son are busy with the newly renovated sailboat. Suddenly, Anna finds herself face to face with a polite young man, the neighbours' guest Peter, who has polite young man, the neighbours' guest Peter, who has come to ask for some eggs because Eva has run out. Anna is about to give Peter the eggs, but hesitates. How did he get onto their property? Peter explains that there's a hole in the fence  Fred showed it to him.Things seem strange from the beginning. Soon, violence erupts. The thriller follows the rules of its genre, providing the deliverance that allows the audience to feel comfortable watching the film. Understandable of how people seem to hate this so much. Just like the Rodriguez/Tarentino exploration flick Grindhouse, Funny Games is painfully underrated and mistaken. This is a take on the genre and how that in these times violence is almost glorified.So what is Haneke's remake playing at? Going back to the crime scene 10 years later for a forensically accurate recreation suggests a pathological self-belief rather than an attempt to hone his vision (see Hitchcock and Michael Mann) or a fascinating self-assessment (see Von Trier and Jorgen Leth). The director has always aimed his gut-punch at American culture and now gets a second, dead-on swing at the target.Co-producer Naomi Watts is exceptional as the suffering wife, as is Michael Pitt as Paul. But Haneke cares not one jot for her wrenching performance, while Peter and Paul aren't characters  they're walking thriller conventions, jolting us to the fact that it's only a movie. They're polite and calculating pseudo-intellectuals, rationalizing their role in the carnage. Sound familiar?",Funny Games
116,o_s_k_r,a movie for masochists,1,19 December 2010,"I ended up watching this by accident and halfway through I realised how terrible it was and skipped ahead to the end. Funny Games is an anti-movie. It's deliberately annoying instead of entertaining, disturbing instead of amusing, boring instead of interesting. Needless to say most movies aren't made like this and I initially found that attitude curious and intriguing. However at the end of the day you're still left with a boring film.There are no likable characters and the tormented family, especially the Tim Roth character, are implausibly wimpy. It's not believable that they would act so passively but maybe it's not meant to be believable. Tim Roth and Naomi Watts look uncomfortable as if they regret acting in this degrading movie, and the director squanders the talents of the entire cast, presumably on purpose. The interesting shots are left out and interminable bland scenes take their place, ie when Roth is trying to get the phone to work.Tedious. Would have made a tolerable short film, ie five or ten minutes. There's something literary about it too, maybe it would have made a good short story. I didn't know that it was a remake of another identical film of Haneke's but it seems incredible that high profile actors would want to be in this knowing exactly how they were going to be treated.I really didn't like this film.",Funny Games
117,RileyOnFilm,Fans of torture horror and thriller genres go see it! Not for everyone.,8,20 November 2017,"The key to enjoying this film is understanding it is its own genre. In America, we have heroes like Bruce Willis and Superman who come in with a big gun and leave us feeling empowered over evil. While I have no real idea what the director was going for here, I will say it's different from what we're used to in a thriller/horror like this.People all must have a place where they connect shouldn't they? Actually, not all people. Sociopaths kill with no empathy. Some of the biggest thriller blockbusters have had killers like these: ie; Hannibal Lecter, Ed Gein, Se7en, and such. These show us killers with no remorse and certainly no regard for human life. Why do we love these films so much? That's another post.I didn't just squirm in my seat watching this film, I writhed. Naomi Watts is always an amazing actress in her films and her name appears in the credits as an executive producer. That means she was really invested in getting this American version made. I would caution viewers against looking for deeper meaning. I think that will end up in a dead end. Still, it is one of those films that leaves you so UNsatisfied according to modern conventions that you almost want to communicate your thoughts with another human after seeing it. My wife and I were yelling at the screen several times. So,e stuff we just could not believe we'd seen.Is it always the job of American films to satisfy us? That is an interesting question I think. I say no. We should have films occasionally that make us feel uncomfortable. We should question our comfort in a media driven culture. Once again, I have no idea what the director meant by this film but I think I am getting warm with this thought. Fans of torture horror and thrillers go see it!",Funny Games
118,varundelpiero,"Disturbing, unpleasant, involving, engaging...",9,2 December 2008,"I did not like FUNNY GAMES U.S. in the same manner that I like chocolate ice-cream or like watching television. But I appreciated this movie immensely, for the mere fact that it was able to engage and involve audiences with the stomach to sit through its entire ~110 minute run-time. I'll admit, there were many times during the movie when I wanted to fast-forward to the end, expecting the big Hollywood finish, and there were many times that I looked away briefly. In the end, I am glad that I made it through. Not only is Michael Haneke's film a blatant slap-in-the-face to Hollywood and those who have become accustomed to Hollywood's ultimately cheery and optimistic nature, it is a film that will provoke reaction from viewers. It will make them FEEL. And any film that can do that in today's desensitised and morally bankrupt society is a work of genius. I myself felt pure rage surging through my veins for the first hour or so, wanting to take the golf clubs and bludgeon the heads of those NASCAR-watching, death metal-listening, incestuous trashy psychos to bloody pulps, and then desecrate their remains. And I am not an evil person. I found myself swearing at the screen every time Michael Pitt's grotesque face appeared, and though I know nothing of the man, save for a few small roles, I think I hate him. And that is the power of FUNNY GAMES U.S.Tim Roth and Naomi Watts are perfectly cast as the loving couple who are the victims of a home invasion. Viewers will develop a sense of longing to see them make it out of their ordeal safely. The actors cast as the demonic villains also do quite well, but I can't even bring myself to mention their names; such is my loathing for them, and again, such is the power of the film. And I am well aware that it is just that: a film; a Motion Picture based on fiction. Yet the underlying messages about the desensitisation of the individual to violence is a potent one. One can recall seeing the unusually high body counts in action movies without flinching, yet watching the act of murder in movies of a more subtle and brooding nature are almost unbearable.When I first saw the film , I hated it. Then the messages grew on me, and elements such as the breaking of the fourth wall, the infamous and debatable remote scene, and the final conversation between the villains, are simply unforgettable. Now, I have become a fan of this movie. Not in the same way I am a fan of the English National Team, mind you, just enough to suggest that I strongly appreciate the film. The movie is an uncomfortable, and unpleasant one, and viewers will hardly find a moment to take a deep breath or relax, as even the quieter scenes are filled to capacity with tension. As such, this has to be one of the most unbearably exhausting films one will see under two hours.The plot is a dark and malevolent one and one that is quite well-developed, but it is not without its flaws, and some of the many conversations/debates that will follow this film will focus on questions such as ""Why didn't she...?"" and ""How come he didn't...?"", and things of that nature. Additionally, there are times when Haneke takes too many liberties with his audience, and on at least one occasion, comes off as unnecessarily cocky and manipulative.FUNNY GAMES U.S. is a powerfully emotional film. I am actually surprised that it was branded as a horror, as there are no real Hollywood type horror elements in the film. As such, I consider the movie as a dark suspense thriller, but a horrific one nonetheless. I am compelled to give this movie a 9/10 and a rating of 3.5 stars (out of 4). I highly recommend films of this nature, in the same way that I recommended 1999's THE WAR ZONE (coincidentally, directed by Tim Roth; a film that safely resides in my Top 60, though I did not like it in the traditional sense of the word), as serious film viewers owe it to themselves to broaden their horizons, and challenge their emotions. This film will enter my Top 100 at #88 or so (a notion that did not cross my mind once during viewing). Highly recommended for serious viewers. For those who are queasy, or upset quickly, the choice is yours. It is not entertainment, but a dark, thought-provoking, forceful, and unforgettable movie-going experience Don't say you weren't warned...",Funny Games
119,rcraig62,Phony Games,1,29 October 2009,"What can i say about this film? For the uninitiated, Funny Games is about a pair of excruciatingly polite young men who insinuate their way into a family of three's vacation home and then systematically torture and murder the entire family. The writer/director Michael Haneke insists that the film is really a protest of the way American cinema toys with human beings so that violence is made consumable, but this sounds suspiciously like the sort of self-important pap that directors often spew out when they realize they've got a klunker on their hands. It goes like this, 'I'm making a powerful statement, but the public is too dumb to understand it.' Practically none of the violence is this film is actually shown; this appears to be Haneke's idea of a reverse cliché, and there are cutesy gimmicks like having characters make sly asides directly to the camera that don't seem to exist for any reason other than being a cutesy gimmick. They feel stuck into the movie at the last minute, attached. Naomi Watts gives a performance as the tortured wife of such power and sincerity that it's admirable, but that's really all I can say in its favor. There is a demi-class of audience that will find this sort of thing entertainingly sick, and I wouldn't hold that against them, but i found the whole thing so dismal and unpleasant, that I don't feel my movie-going life was enriched in any way by having seen it.",Funny Games
120,movedout,A rather irrelevant critique on our pop culture fetishes,6,13 April 2008,"Ever the confrontational cinematic essayist, Michael Haneke follows up his immensely tantalising masterwork ""Caché"" in 2005 with a shot-by-shot replica of his 1997 ""Funny Games"", now technically called ""Funny Games U.S."", by way of churlish didacticism. If the German-language original's finger wag wasn't already satisfied aiming its insults at an audience's base urges of bloodlust, then the remake adds an extra soupcon of condescension by basing it in English as its raison d'être - just because Haneke felt that the most uncouth purveyors of movie violence that needed to see his treatise on the audience-filmmaker symbiosis would not respond to European sensibilities. But Haneke's English-language debut is an admittedly intriguing failure, an inconsequential reading on our scavenging voyeurism and isn't so much a lazy remake as it is a rather irrelevant critique on our pop culture fetishes.In what would be a terrific genre film if it continued to play straight, Haneke presents to us an unsettling premise of a family seized upon by fresh-faced psychopaths in their gated community lakeside vacation home. Like young upstart Ivy League social predators that reflect its Austrian director's own siege on bourgeois precepts, Peter (Brady Corbet) and Paul (Michael Pitt) descend on the unassuming household in tennis whites and ominous white gloves, insinuating themselves into their activities and giddily refusing to leave. The gloved men then hold the family - Anne (a tremendous Naomi Watts), George (Tim Roth), and the young Georgie (Devon Gearhart) - hostage and commence a physical and mental torture game throughout the night that begins Haneke's film thesis on victims and perpetrators and our perceived expectations.Haneke's breaches an interesting topic of discussion in violence films' latent dissimulation of guilt and sympathy, where we identify with the on screen viciousness instead of being appalled by it and how it's simply labelled as ""entertainment. However high-minded this endeavour to deconstruct these filmic conventions ends up, the film's sole debilitation is Haneke's own love-hate relationship with the idea of sadism. He is as much a product of his own sanguinary environment as he thinks his audience is or will be, but never admits it or turns the finger pointing towards the filmmaker. And because of this, nothing truly gets deconstructed here. We get glimpses of what he's getting at but never anything approaching a penetrative statement and those moments of furtiveness elides the opportunity for authentic discourse.The points of interest in the film are its visual triggers. They are littered in different scenes throughout the film in key areas that serve to solidify its classification as a meta-thriller. The fourth wall gets broken intermittently, a narrative conundrum out of left field, the conscious redaction of certain images and a subtle paradigm shift are just some of the film's emerging features that alienates the audiences it skewers and subsequently admonishes. It's Haneke's version of the ultimate tease - it wants to deny us the pleasure of expectations while showing us the right amounts of leg to keep drawing us into its perverse grandstanding. Is this Haneke's actual funny game? Because curiously enough, the only one who seems to get any sort of onanistic thrill out of this mocking jive is Haneke himself.",Funny Games
121,freydis-e,Nasty empty and worthless.,1,22 October 2009,"This comment DEFINITELY contains spoilers – the idea is to stop you wasting your time on this rubbish. Let's start with the entire plot: a couple of sadistic psychos have just murdered a family, they murder another family, at the end they're moving on to murder a third family. That's it. There really is nothing else here.That's all this particular film deserves by way of description, but IMDb like reviews to be a bit longer so here goes. There's no humour, no sharp dialogue, no ideas, no thought-provoking observations, no sex, no nudity, little graphic violence, not much excitement or suspense, very few scary moments, no surprises, nothing original or even unusual for this type of film. Nothing much happens and the director loves lingering shots where nothing at all does. There's only the relentless nastiness, which, like everything else, soon becomes merely tedious.I've never given a one-star rating before. Is there really nothing good here? Honestly not much. The acting's not bad. Tim Roth is always good and he does well without having much of a part. As to how he got involved with something like this, or why The writer-director thinks he's being clever and arty with asides to camera, rewinding the action etc, but what he has produced is drab and monotonous as a fetishist's fantasy – and perhaps that's exactly what it is. If cruelty turns you on, it may even work for you. If not, don't waste your time. A nasty, apparently vacant mind has produced an empty vessel, which can't even manage to make much noise.

122,martylee13045burlsink342,Not QUITE shot for shot...and not quite as powerful.....,5,15 March 2009,"I recently came across the Austrian original on a VHS tape I recorded several years ago...and had never gotten around to watching. Since I had the American remake on DVD I decided to watch them on consecutive days...mainly to judge how close the director came to recreating his first attempt...and whether or not the attempt was worth while.I will answer the second question first because it is the simplest reply. No...the effort did not pay off. The second version offers only minor ""improvements"" over the original (slightly smoother technical gloss...some refinements in performance). I would advocate watching the remake instead of the original ONLY if you are completely unable to read subtitles...Describing the film as a ""Shot for Shot"" remake is far from accurate. There are in fact several telling differences which may be efforts by the director to tailor the film for American tastes...such as the suspicious and rather menacing German Shepard of the Austrian version being replaced by a much more cuddly and nonthreatening Irish setter in this version...a substitution that may amp up the shock value of one scene in the film a bit...just about the only refinement to have a positive impact on the remix version).The other major differences are mainly in acting styles and surface presentation. There is a rawness and honesty to the terror portrayed by the lead actors in the Austrian version that Watts and Roth don't quite manage to capture. Watts never quite comes across with the mixture of panic, shock, and hatred that made the character so electrifying in the original. Roth is also muted in comparison to the original portrayal...but seems to better capture the desperation of the situations involved.What really differentiates the two versions for me is the portrayal of the two Homicidal bad boys. In the European version they have an ""Oscar Wild""ian wittiness and naughtiness on top of their sadism...it seems much less evident in the rather leaden and oafish underplaying in the remake.One final note...the LOVE it or HATE it infamous ""remote"" scene works better in the original...as do the asides to the audience...but they are bound to be controversial any language...",Funny Games

Funny Games is yet a further example of his style in action. Find a plot with unpleasant themes, throw in some 'alternative' techniques (there's good reasons why such techniques aren't usually used), shock the audience into taking notice (possibly keep them awake) and hope the critics don't notice how empty and mediocre the production actually is. He's fooled people before Funny Games with the phoney mystery in Hidden and fooled people since with the overplayed understatement of Amour. The central themes to Haneke's work are potentially interesting but the ways in which they are dealt with are needlessly complex to the point where they don't provide insights or develop deeper understanding. Well composed shots with interesting mise-en-scène are not enough to make a film memorable and long takes of little happening end up as distracting rather than revealing.

Unfortunately, the director simply wants to make a point about violence in movies. He basically is stating that people that enjoy the violence are sick.As for the movie itself, it does have a good performance by Watts and overall the acting is good. However, it builds no suspense and breaks the cardinal rules about films. The characters talk to the audience and uses a remote control to change the events of the film.I don't know who movie would appeal to. It does not have much violence for the gore hounds and I don't find a couple of psychopaths torturing a family (all off-screen) to be entertaining.The movie has no suspense, humor, violence, and only a message that violence is bad.I personally am not a gore hound but I do think the director does not give people enough credit.

As the plot is about two young psychopaths who take hostage an innocent family, to play a sadistic game and make them suffer in the worst ways. This movie has been appreciated by some critics, as well as, by some filmmakers who have been influenced by it. Other filmmakers and critics found the movie overrated, boring and pointless, as the movie uses very slow and repetitive mise-en-scénes to be not even interesting. But Funny Games is still considered one of the most important movies, which can be appreciated or even be hated. The auteur filmmaker Michael Haneke decided to remake his own Austrian movie, as he originally wanted to release his picture in an American movie. In 2007 came out Funny Games by Michael Haneke with Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, Michael Pitt, Brady Corbet and Devon Gearhart. The movie's plot: Two young psychopaths (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) take hostage a family (Naomi Watts, Tim Roth and Devon Gearhart) in the vacation cabin. There have been expectation to see a different vision of the movie, than what has been seen in the original Funny Games. Especially to see if the director would give some changes, to improve or even to give new ideas in the remake. Instead the movie completely bores the audience and the critics as it repeats, shot by shot from the original Austrian movie to be predictable and pointless. Usually making shot by shot remakes, disappoint the audience and the critics, who would already expect what is going to happen in the story. The camera and the lightenings were one of the best work of the movie, as well as the sound worked very well, which most of Michael Haneke's movies are notable for the specific use of the sounds. Even the technical side of Funny Games was impressive, it would not justify the several problems of the movie. The cast did acceptable performances, to play as good as they could. But they recopy the same performances from the cast of the original Austrian movie, which would not surprise in any way the audience and the critics. Funny Games is one of the worst remakes of all time, based on one of the most overrated movies.",Funny Games
128,Moviespot,A non-creative & silly - Clockwork Orange rip-off,4,19 June 2008,"This film leaves you just plain bored...en makes one realize that it takes real talent to make an important movie.This is not the case in here. The horrible suspense in this film is so utterly unrealistic that it fails to even give you a slight hint of the seriousness of the occurrences.The lack of the family of resistance against these two sadistic brads is stunning and makes this film totally un-believable. Filming this script is an easy job if you can obtain the money to get the design right.as the story goes...Haneke is absolutely influenced by Clockwork orange by Kubrick. But he failed to deliver the same sense of wonderful creativity and got stuck in a monster. an unconvincing and unrealistic waste....*I mean , the availability of options , the family is left with to put up a real resistance towards these two sadistic creeps , is stunning ! but Haneke has us believing that these people are mere rabbits sitting in the middle of the highway , blinded by the oncoming traffic.. That's the most mediocre & unforgiving giving of this failure... & makes it very , very silly. a hangover is left after watching.",Funny Games
129,Netscape_Navigator,the rewind scene = higher rating for this movie,6,14 July 2008,"Here's a trend I've noticed about movies and the ratings they get from the general public (well the IMDb population to be specific). Anytime there's an average or mediocre movie, whenever there's even the SLIGHTEST attempt at some underlying higher meaning to the movie, or some kind of social commentary, or something as blatant as the director saying ""well here's where I was going with this,"" the movie AUTOMATICALLY gets about half a point to a full point higher in average rating than it probably deserves. It's like people realize, ""oh crap, so that's what he was trying to say in this movie? I totally missed that, let me give this a higher rating so people don't think I'm dense for missing the point."" What a great equalizer. Whenever that ""point"" exists in your piece of crap movie, it gets elevated to this pristine level of existence where you can't *dare criticize the movie, otherwise you totally missed the director's point. Mulholland Drive and Babel immediately come to mind as one of those pointless films that's gotten exalted to a higher status because of the ""point"" those movies were making. Tearing down portion of the review: **I don't care what his previous work was, Tim Roth (the father) was a JOKE in this movie. I'm not even talking about his character decisions yet (i.e. criticizing things his character in the movie did), I'm talking about the actor himself. What's with the teary eyes the entire time? If he didn't look like he was about to cry he looked like he was falling asleep at other times. There's other miscellaneous scenes in which his body language, tone of voice, facial muscle contortions were so off that I was laughing at his character's plight.**The father in this movie has got to be the most pathetic male in the history of mankind. In the beginning when he initially gets punked out and whacked with a golf club, did you see how he tried to protect his son? First of all, ideally, you'd actually be fighting back from the ground, but worst case, you'd try to jerk your son away from the attackers, and then/or shield him with your body. Instead he casually held his arm out in the same carefree way you would casually open your umbrella upon first hint of a few raindrops. I was wondering when he planned on grabbing the leg of the attacker and trying to bring him down to the ground.**Exactly WTF kind of injury did he sustain anyway?? What kind of pain does a grown man sustain from a golf club that keeps him silently weeping and giving up while your wife and son are in danger right there with you? You'd think he was whacked on his head the way he was mentally debilitated the whole time.**That kid was the worst hide and go seek player in history.**When she was about to make a call on the newly obtained cell phone near the end, why did Naomi Watts have to ask WHO to call, as her pathetic husband gruffly tells her to call the police.**There should've been many more moments with a lot more screaming from the parents, in which the captors would tell them to be quiet. Instead they are just like phantoms just going along with the ride, periodically throwing in generic comments like ""why are you doing this?"" or ""take what you need and leave.""**What type of person, let alone an entire family, gets held hostage by a nine iron? There were way too many occasions where Naomi Watts had a great opportunity to attempt something.**When the son is killed, the parents show no grief. There's no NOISE at all. Later when Naomi Watts was consoling the grieving husband as he moaned like a fool, I assumed that his mouth was gagged or duct taped. Nope. That was just that stupid character (or actor's) ""method."" He was really getting the grief across there with that moaning.**I liked the main villain in this movie. Good acting. He was much scarier than a lot of other killers in other traditional horror movies.",Funny Games
130,InMyHonestOpinion,A film to push the boundaries of reality and fiction,7,15 February 2015,"There have been a lot of films since the industry began that have attempted to push boundaries, boundaries of reality and fiction, boundaries of what is right and wrong, what is acceptable and unacceptable. ""Funny Games"" is Michael Haneke's attempt to be ""ground breaking"". ""Anyone who leaves the cinema doesn't need the film, and anybody who stays does."" Michael Haneke the writer/director on his film ""Funny Games"" said back in 1997. Originally this film was made in Austria and in non- English, Henke remade it for his English audiences so he can let his experiment be known to a much wider audience. Funny Games is an experiment in film making it's not a horror as most believe it is, it more a new genre where reality and fiction cross lines. Haneke stated that the film is a reflection and criticism of violence used in media. Funny Game is a psychological thriller that most will find hard to stomach. Those who are a fan of the macabre gene of cinema will have seen this already. I have decided to review it for the simple reason that I found it fascinating and couldn't look away. Sure it was graphic in nature, surreal and hard to stomach but the acting, the script, the nonsense of it all made it worthy. George and Ann Farber, their son Georgie, and their dog Lucky arrive at their holiday home; a lake house ready for a two week vacation. When they arrive they see their neighbour talking with two young men all dressed in tennis whites, soon after one of the men knocks on the door; Paul. Paul asks Ann who is cooking in the kitchen for four eggs as a request from their neighbour, as soon as Ann hands the young man the eggs he drops them, Ann gives him another four eggs feeling a little annoyed and the man leaves. Georgie and Georgie are at the lake in their boat where they can hear Lucky their dog barking hysterically, soon after Paul is back at the door this time with Peter. The young men admire a golf club and then once again ask for four more eggs, apparently their dog Lucky jumping broke them the last time. Ann gets really frustrated after the boys ask for four more eggs and asks them to leave her home. Outside George and Georgie are fixing up their small boat and hear the dog barking nonstop when suddenly there is a yelp and the barking ceases. George and Georgie go back to the house to see Ann worked up and the two boys who won't leave, there is a slight disagreement and George slaps one of the boys. In retaliation Peter breaks George's leg with the golf club he was admiring earlier, it is then the Farber family are told they are being held hostage and won't be alive in nine hours Michael Pitt (Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I Origins) who plays Paul is brilliantly disturbed in his role as is his offsider Peter played by Brady Corbet (Mysterious Skin, Thirteen). Paul constantly picks on Peter's weight and lack of intelligence and tells stories of Peter's past only to then come clean that he has lied. When the boys first arrive they are so polite and well-mannered and as the film progresses they never lose that personality no matter what the circumstance is. They are cold meticulous and rather intelligent it seems so all you can ever wonder is why? Why are they holding this poor family hostage? What is the real reason behind the home invasion? As the film progresses it becomes harder and harder to watch but what makes it so unique is the way Michael often turns towards the camera and smirks as if to say ""you know what's coming next don't you"" there are a few words actually spoken to us as the audience as well at one point we are asked ""who's going to win, do you want to place your bets?"" It seems as only Paul ever acknowledges he is in a movie though often referring to the way movies play out and how he is running things to keep the audience (us) entertained. This has been done before but never with such an outrageous character. Naomi Watts (Birdman, St Vincent) plays Ann Farber, Tim Roth (Lie to me, Pulp Fiction) plays George Farber with Devon Gearhart (Shorts, Changeling) as Georgie Farber. Ever character here is perfect in who they need to be it would have been a very hard role to play no matter who you were so I take my hat off to everyone on the screen involved. As I have already said this is not an easy film to watch and whether you decide to watch the original from 1997 or the remake from 2007 you will get exactly the same film, shot for shot. I love what Henke is trying to say here basically he has made a film where he wants you to walk out, he wants you to fail his experiment, he wants to offend every fiber of your soul, but if you do watch till the end what does that mean about who you are as a person? Let me say this last thing about this film, it's not a ""Hostel"", it's not a ""Scream"", it's not a ""Salo"" or a ""Serbian Story"". You don't actually see much of anything to turn your stomach it's what you hear and what you imagine that will make you ill. I personally wish there wouldn't mind more films of this nature, what this say's about me I'm uncertain. I love a movie that can make me think for days afterwards, a movie you bring up in conversation with friends a movie that makes you wonder about life as a whole. As you can read; this is not a family friendly movie and I would only watch this if you feel mentally stable enough.",Funny Games
131,picturetaker,Absolutely TERRIBLE! My copy is in the Garbage can!,1,31 January 2009,"This review WILL contain spoilers! So I am a fan of Naomi Watts. She was great in the Ring movies. So I thought I would check this movie out. Yeah big mistake! Heck I got this movie for $4 and STILL A WASTE OF MONEY! Why? First of all the two ""bad guys"" in white, they were with out a doubt the worst characters I have ever seen, especially for bad guys. They ask for eggs and then simply work their way into homes to start playing some sort of game. What game? I think the funny game is that people paid money to watch this. The Game is, they are playing a game with you (the audience) by wasting your time and money! Haha you got me.Of course I know this movie is not supposed to be funny. Duh! But what exactly was the point of this Psychotic movie? To watch three people get murdered? Like come on! But besides all that what really makes this movie bad is how Paul (the head bad guy) keeps talking to the camera like he is talking to you. When you finally get sick of this contrived theatrical display he uses a remote control to actually REWIND the film and change it to his favour. This was over the top and made the movie terrible.And yes I know this is a Artsy type movie. The kind to make the viewer think and ask questions like ""Why am I watching this?"" and ""What meaning does this have?"". I watch those too and there are some Artsy movies I have liked. This movie is bad art and is a bad movie period!This movie tries to be clever, it tries to get you involved but honestly it falls so flat on its face.

134,Sabalon,"Nothing Special, not as bad as others say",4,24 April 2008,"I had not seen the original version of this and was really not sure what to expect. Some of the comments and plot outlines make it sound like 2 hours of sadistic torture for the characters. Not sure what movie they saw.Basically, not much happens during this movie. Like it says, a family is taken hostage in their house. Occasionally one may try to get away or something, but for the most part it is repeated ""Why are you doing this?"". The characters are pretty bland, and almost anyone could have stood up and played any of the characters and you would not have noticed. Tim Roth brought nothing to the film. Naomi Watts is beautiful, but also didn't have much to work with.They want you to feel bad for the family, but I really just felt they were a bunch of wimps who can't even stop a couple of teenagers. As for the kids, and the breaking of the fourth wall. While it was supposed to present some sort of commentary on violence, it just seemed kinda silly.The movie did keep my interest more or less to the end, which is why I gave it a 4.

135,scrapmetal7,I call bullsh*t.,1,13 February 2009,"This movie is about a family who is tormented at gunpoint and murdered one by one by two jerks. That is all it is about.Now, a lot of pretentious, obvious smut peddling has gone on over this film. Over and over again you will hear how it is a ""scream of anger directed at the viewer"" and garbage like that, as if the film's creator is really some kind of peace loving, soulful artist who just wants people to think, for cryin' out loud. I call bullsh*t, for the following reasons.1. The kind of viewer who actually has sadistic reasons for watching violence in films to some problematic degree is not going to be affected by this kind of thing...they are going to BUY it, and they are going to LOVE it. The director, with all his ""angry screaming"", did nothing more than make them some more porn. We are talking about the ""Faces of Death"" crowd. This is a very small, private minority. The majority of filmgoers do not need or deserve this lesson.2. When people complain about violent movies, the typical scenario they are talking about is a good guy who must take on powerful bad guys, and gets his ass kicked most of the time as he kicks the bad guy's asses back. I don't know anyone who likes watching children tortured, terrorized, and killed on film. So who is the FUNNY GAMES lesson for? People who already don't like to see it? They will not like to see it here, and that is no surprise. People who DO want to see that happen? Well, they will be delighted. There are very few movies that feature anything like this, and the idiot who made this movie gave those perverts a big present, wrapped in a shiny bow.3. People tend to do what they want to do. So, if a filmmaker makes a horrible, sad, offensive, obscene movie and then turns around and acts like he felt forced to make it to teach someone a lesson, he is full of sh*t. He isn't trying to teach a lesson, he is trying to bring his sick fantasies to life, like any pornographer. The fact that he can claim to hold some moral high ground as he hands the viewers a plate full of sh*t, and makes impressionable people think they should feel at fault for what he himself did is just a joke he is playing on the viewership. He is laughing his ass off at how he made a something horrible and perverted for his own kicks and thrills and got you to call it art.The bottom line is, you can't fight volence in films by making one more violent film. And the director knows that. It was never really his goal anyway.",Funny Games
136,I_saw_it_happen,Nice and eerie,7,11 June 2008,"This movie is pretty disturbing, does not try to pander to the audience's desires (at least no audience I would want to be a part of), and manages to make an interesting mark in a very tired genre. The problems with this film are the same problems that are to be expected in any sort of suspense thriller such as this one; a certain matter of 'they should have done this' that is nonetheless made clearly moot in several cases by subsequent actions.Tim Roth's acting is fairly unimpressive here; he's not bad, but his character is not called upon to do much. Naomi Watts does well, but in a role that seems quite predictable and limited in many ways. The child actor actually does a pretty fantastic job. The 'killers' also play their role with a definite creepy consistency which becomes more and more unnerving throughout the film.This movie will certainly not leave you feeling happy, or fulfilled. Have something else ready to watch afterwards.With that said--- it's a pretty good movie. By not explicitly showing most of the violence, it makes the violence less substantial than the tension and stress that the threat of violence function under. It's very difficult to write much more about this movie without giving away just about everything that makes it worth watching; but know that it's a meditation on violence as entertainment, and by the end, you will realize (after quite a bit of 'breaking the fourth wall' throughout the film) that your own participation in watching this film is the whole essence of why it's creepy at all.",Funny Games

This movie is a prime example of the trash that Hollywood has produced over the last five years. The story is poorly written and geared to show acts of torture and heartless crimes. The acting is just trash--scream, plead, scream, beg--nothing new in today's film making. This DVD is only worth sitting a soda upon it while watching another DVD. What makes it go beyond bad, to pitiful, is that after 90 minutes of sitting through the torture, pleading, trash talk, and sickening acting--the heroine finally gets a break and shoots one of the culprits with a shotgun. BUT WAIT---the second culprit grabs the TV remote control and turns back time---WHAT!!!! What kind of stupidity is this? Where did this come from? Nothing in the story led to this being able to be a possibility--and how could it be so? Wouldn't the family have just used the remote control and do away with the entire weekend?

I'm astonished at the degree of hostility FUNNY GAMES has generated. Professional critics have leveled a lot of charges against it. One of them said the American family in it was too European. Not only is that a strange reason to knock a movie, it's inaccurate. I've encountered a lot of people who look, talk and act like the family in this film. Some say the violence is gratuitous. If those who say this have watched IN COLD BLOOD, CAPOTE or any of the many movies about Leopold and Loeb, they'll remember that abominable acts take center stage. These are based on real life. If someone wants to call KING LEAR slasher-porn, they may. (""Out vile jelly,"" anyone?)

140,ken_bethell,Appalling,1,29 July 2008,It is difficult to comprehend how such an appalling movie was made. My family sat there shaking their heads in disbelief as to what was unfurling before their eyes. How did Naomi Watts ever get herself involved in such an awful production.I have no idea what the German original was like but it had to be better than this. Presumably in an effort to inject poignancy and engender some sympathy for the victims the director applied static cameras concentrating on the contorted expressions of the suffering Watts and Roth.During one living room scene of more than 15 minutes the camera did not pan or zoom but on just one occasion moved six feet left. The action was so slow I thought the DVD had frozen. Ultimately you couldn't careless what happened to Watts and company and I still don't know what happened since it became so excruciating that I called a halt to proceedings with less than 10 minutes to go.,Funny Games
141,bobcolganrac,"Deeply, Deeply Disturbing to watch. Brilliantly Done, Though.",9,21 August 2017,"Many others have written thoughtful critiques here, most of which cite the director's amazing scene-by-scene duplication of his original German film......okay.What got me about this film, almost more than any film I have watched, is the extraordinary graphic capture of psychopathy.That the two young white-gloved (nice touch: innocence, cleanliness, oblique reference to mimes, fingerprintless) captors embody complete lack of caring for others better than any other film characters I have seen---complete lack of empathy, or sympathy for that matter-- makes this the consummate movie to watch if you want to try to understand psychopaths.Ellison's character, Bates, in ""American Psycho"" comes close, but that film heavily redacted the violence portrayed in the book (which had they shown it would have gotten it blacklisted, probably)....still, this movie, even though violence is inferred and usually off-camera, manages to give the viewer a look at callousness in its purest form. In war movies, in movies about concentration camp abuses such as ""Schindler's List"" the callousness occurs in an ambiance of prison barbarity. Everything in that matrix conveys heartlessness------------but here, the setting is upscale Americana. Regular well-to-do folks, in their well-to-do-not-far-removed- lookswise-from-regular-homes vacation home setting. Thus the jarring juxtaposition of meaningless violence in upper suburbia has the effect of increasing the horror factor as it also ups the unease one experiences the entirety of the film.Watching a spider toy with its prey by moving in and biting the unlucky netted victim repeatedly and then beginning to wrap it before death has overtaken it -----gives some idea of how one feels when watching this movie. But the spider is gathering food. That's not the case here: everything that happens is gratuitous, without reason, without rational sense. That Micheal Pitts looks remarkably at times like young Donald Trump....? Just more icing on this truly sick, but amazingly powerful film about people using other people without any regard for them.I would give it a 10, and considering I am still shaking after watching it last evening it probably could be a 10.Not for the sensitive, or easily disturbed viewer at all.",Funny Games

Anyone could make a movie where the bad guy(s) walk away, but who the hell wants to see a movie like that except for sick sadistic perverts? In real life the pathetic stupid sadistic trash portrayed in this film would get what they deserve. To be honest I truly thought this movie would end showing the two bad guys getting bullets to the head and me cheering, a movie and the actors that can gets its audience hating the bad guys so much that they cheer when they get bullets to the head has done a magnificent job, but this movie just leaves thinking what the hell wad the point?

143,j_graves68,"""Ciao Bella...""",6,22 March 2008,"Probably one of the most anti-climatic cinematic murder/death/kills in recent years that I've seen, yet simultaneously realistic and haunting. I mean, really: what could you do to stay alive if your hands were tied while gagged at the same time when thrown into a lake/estuary? Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, Michael Pitt and Brady Corbett (effectively creepy from the moment they appear outside the door) all give a disturbing, unsettling, realistic and I must admit, a very entertaining hour and forty-seven minutes of a performance that absolutely goes nowhere (as if it were a slice of violence rather than life), providing the viewer with a ridiculous hope-deficit. I never heard of the original film when this remake came out and knowing that it was made exactly like Gus Van Sandt's 1998 ""Psycho"" remake, I have no desire to see it, either. The film felt somewhat like a foreign film in the way it was photographed and the opening titles. But that was good that the director stuck to his guns because if it were tailored for an American audience, the movie would of taken a turn for the implausible worst by the middle of the film. Test audiences would be offended by the story's outcome, so the filmmakers would scurry and slap on a ridiculous new cookie-cutter-type conclusion beginning where Tim Roth pleads to Naomi Watts forgive him. From there if it were Americanized, the perps and Tim would probably be in on a conspiracy in where the son is killed and then they kill Naomi and then split the insurance money that they collect three ways and then meet up in Bermuda or something ridiculous like that. The usual greed conspiracies that are standard in American film formulas these days, which is very possible/probable. Somewhere in the last fifteen years, audiences seem to have dominated a film's destiny and it wouldn't surprise me if European audiences were not as judging or fickle. Director Michel Haneke dismisses the fact that a grim remake of this film wouldn't necessarily appeal to American audiences, and being mindful of that, he cleverly casts a siren like Watts; a versatile and entertaining character-actor like Roth; an unknown who is neither a ham or annoying child actor to play their son; a sinister creep like Michael Pitt and his sidekick Brady Corbett who as an ensemble, propel the film from beginning to end. What's more, is that the ""kids"" kill these affluent families one after another, and we see their first victims from a distance deep behind their front gate with Pitt and Corbett in tow, mirroring as to what Watts, Roth and son will be within an hour or so from that point. And when Watts rendezvous with her friend after some time from her abduction, as the viewer you have an idea that the character will return again in the film's duration. When I saw her at the end, I was waiting for Watts to miraculously recover from being tossed aside like an infinitesimal piece of trash from the boat but didn't. Instead, the film ends with almost how it begins. Eggs, anyone? It is not to say that I didn't find the film without flaws: I didn't like how Michael Pitt broke the fourth wall in the middle of the film (and for me, I re-entered reality at this point and slowly began to doubt the film). Also- what were Pitt and Corbett's motives? Is it true what they said earlier about robbing rich people and then murdering them? And did they ever sleep since Watts and her family were the second set of victims (for all we know as an audience) in their blood-fest marathon? And why is there the cliché that all rich people like to listen to classical music (as another poster cites as well)? Still, even though the film offered little redeeming (if any) qualities to it, it is still haunting to me let alone watching repeat viewings. Not necessarily a movie I would buy as soon as it were released onto DVD, yet I'm secretly curious to watch the special features.",Funny Games

It's all in the name of ""entertainment"" and ""plausible plot development"" as Paul/Jerry/Butthead (Michael Pitt) so satirically states in one of his numerous direct camera convos.The rules, then, of Haneke's not-so-funny game are often bent to the extent that they evoke confusion, participation and questions as to whether the world the German director has crafted is based on fantasy or reality, fact or fiction. Discussions between the two nutjobs regarding parallel universes appear to offer a glimmer of reason, and a certain use of a surreal spool back technique three-quarters of the way through the film will leave you wondering whether you should laugh or cry. Either way, Haneke's resourceful approach to a seemingly simple tale alienates the diegetic world in which it is contained. You don't have to be a fan of independent and/or experimental film-making to view Funny Games U.S through a set of compulsive eyes, though. Despite the 180 degree rule breaks, prolonged stationary shots, direct camera addresses (""What do you think? Think they stand a chance?"") and sky plus stunts, the film itself is compelling and everything the likes of Hostel, Saw and every other mindless torture flick of past and present wanted or wants to be.The eccentricity kicks in from the opening sequence- a Shining-esquire high-angle tracking shot of the family car as it crawls along a long a winding country road. As soon as the family's game of guessing the name of the classical tune is interrupted by an assault of non-diegetic heavy metal music, accompanied by the film's title scrawled across the screen in red- you know you're in for something different. It's not everyday you get to see two of Hollywood's more recognisable stars (Naomi Watts as mum- Ann and Tim Roth as dad- George) playing seemingly expendable, powerless characters. But they do so with such conviction and authenticity. Roth is superb, Watts better, but it's Michael Pitt that owns all- calm, calculated and provocatively unsettling. Pitt delivers a polished performance of a knowingly ill-famed tormentor that deserves to be ranked amidst the likes of Misery's Annie Wilkes, Se7en's John Doe and Hannibal Lecter himself.There is considerably little mainstream spectators will be able to relate to when compared to modern day psychological horrors. Not that that's a bad thing, of course. Because Funny Games U.S is an engaging yet eccentric all-round experience- some may even go as far as saying that it's the kind of film Kubrick would've made if he'd still been alive. Imagine, if you will, Hard Candy by the way of A Clockwork Orange. Only with a dash of Cape Fear and a semi-surreal, nom de plume psychotic edge. The result? one of the better films of 2008.",Funny Games

In that sense it's similar to ""Shapes of Things."" The director has an axe to grind, only he actually has an axe to grind about people who have axes to grind, only in the end he's only joking about having an axe to grind about people who have axes to grind.This is a movie in which violence, torture, horror and murder are punchlines. If you think violence, torture, horror and murder are punchlines, you'll probably like this movie. In spite of the nesting Russian doll nature of this movie, at bottom it's torture porn. It's not brainless torture porn like ""Saw"" but it's torture porn nonetheless.The sad thing, to me, is that there is some very good acting in the movie, but the movie itself is a waste. As I said, it's a meta-text, a murder joke. Example: The movie encourages, in fact practically forces, the viewer to wish urgently for revenge on the thugs. At one point one of the victims snatches up a shotgun and blows a hole in one of the thugs. So the other thug grabs a remote, hits the reverse button, and we see the movie back up to a point where he can repeat the scene and prevent the victim from killing his companion.If you think that kind of thing makes for an interesting, thought-provoking movie, you'll probably enjoy it.As for the unusual, long, still-shot frames, yada yada, unusual, etc. (Except for every movie Kubrick ever made. And every movie made by a director emulating Kubrick.) The movie ends with a freeze-frame of the villain staring into the camera as he's about to embark on another torture/killing spree.

152,craigman,I'll give it some points for originality,6,5 December 2008,"I just watched this with my brother, who liked it more than me. I grew up on a steady diet of horror movies, but I usually don't prefer the torture types, like Saw or Hostel. I must admit, it held my interest and was fairly unpredictable and broke the formula of the average horror movie. It definitely didn't take itself too seriously, and broke the taboo of child murder. I admit, I was cheering when Watts shot one of the baddies, like most would, and groaned when her victory was deleted, ""Click""-style. I understood why the director did this.I found myself yelling at the family to do something, anything, like fight back. The father, while injured in the knee, still had three working limbs, but never used them to defend his own family! Many chances to escape, or grab a weapon were given, but the family seemed to stupidly think they would survive the ordeal if they stuck together and did nothing, I guess. Well, they were ""dead wrong""! Sorry, couldn't help it.The main message I got from this movie was that the average American, or any civilized family seems to have become so soft and complacent, that when faced with such a threat, they become quivering masses of jelly. They don't have any fighting instinct left. Like our beloved dogs (most of them), they have forgotten how to use their teeth and nails to defend themselves and loved ones. I would like to think that my two Labs would leap to my rescue, but most likely they would cringe and cower.It's easy to say that you would have done a lot more than this family did in order to survive, but most people don't know how they will react in such a situation unless it actually happened to them.

153,Toocooltoobefooled,Sick movie,1,6 October 2016,"What did I just watch? Here's a movie that had no business being made. This is a sick movie for sick people. The director and writer are depraved individuals. Roughly two hours of a family being tortured after two depraved individuals clearly had tortured other families and then continue their twisted path on to the next family. We don't need any more movies like this inspiring more sicko's to get ideas. This is right up there with 8 mm, but much more depraved. OK now that I've ranted, I'll give it a review. Acting is good, the weird rewind that occurs in the middle of the movie does make you wonder if you are simply experiencing what two individuals are writing as a book or movie (also the scene on the boat and what they say suggests the same). Wow how mind blowing, all an excuse to work out on film someones sick and depraved fantasy. The director was born in the 40's, he must have had quite a bit of exposure as a child to the aftermath of horror from WWII, clearly inspired.

I thought that some of the main characters' actions and decisions were completely unreasonable and that they should have chosen other actions, so it made it hard for me to sympathize. I also thought it was overly indulgent in the way it was filmed. Some shots went on FOREVER.

156,ppilf,IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS of this SUPERB film; those people shouldn't be reviewing films,8,30 August 2017,"Funny Games (2007) is a USA English-speaking identical remake of the 1997 Austrian film of the same name. Both films were written and directed by the world-renowned Austrian screen playwright and director Michael Haneke, one of the greatest film artists working today. Both films are fascinating psychological crime thrillers that portray the criminal sadist mind. This film is more of the intellectual genre rather than the brainless action/gore thriller; it is sometimes referred to as ""playing with your mind"". Some people just can't grasp that genre, so please don't let negative reviews by brainless fuddy-duddies influence you. Watch this movie! It is great! Yes, it's very dark, intense, and shocking, but you could list a dozen other famous and great films that are equally dark and shocking. So, I concurrently agree that if you don't like dark psychological crime movies, then you shouldn't view this movie. But to call this a poor film because you can't digest the subject matter is simply dumb.Funny Games depicts a home invasion perpetrated by two psychopathic young men upon a moderately wealthy young couple who are vacationing at their private lake home with their child son. The two psychopaths gain entry to the victim's home by appearing genuine and normal at first. The screenwriter's combination of ""cold politeness"" with utter depravity in the two young criminals is part of this film's unique morbid appeal. I won't reveal any further details to avoid further spoiling the suspense and story to prospective viewers.If you like dark suspense, this film will keep you frightened and glued to your seat from beginning to end. Because one thing that this film is NOT, is predictable. It also contains a surprise scene that temporarily shifts into the realm of fantasy, which further bends minds and entertains the audience. The acting, directing, story development, and screenplay are excellent.",Funny Games
157,drnrg31,Angels or Demons,9,11 November 2008,"I just read one review which really caught my attention. I was originally ready with a different premise for my review, but upon reading this one review, my aspect really changed about the movie.The reviewer in question refers to the two young sadistic young men as angels. I couldn't understand why this one reviewer thought that; then it dawned on me. One: we are never really told where they come from. They just appear. Two: they are dressed completely in white. Tennis apparel and white gloves, but non the less in white. Three: The two young men somehow have the ability to break the fourth wall and alternate the film to their liking....but why angles? Why not devils? They certainly show no characteristics of Angels whatsoever. In one scene they ask Naomi Watts to pray to her GOD for salvation, but in such a fashion that only ridicules her even more. So these angels are suddenly and without a question demons.Keeeping that in mind, the movie will make a lot more sense, once you realize you are not watching the latest Tarrantino like film. Even the casting of Tim Roth might make you believe just that. The movie is actually a remake of Michael Haneke's own Australian version. I have never seen that version, but this one struck me short of Brilliance. No over the top action or explosions, but rather a sort of ""arthouse"" film with many quirky scenes, that seem like the updated version of AClock Work Orange or even an acted out Manson murder spree.The two Demons in question are played brilliantly by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet. I remember Pitt from the movie Murder By Numbers. His role isn't to far away from that one. Only that instead of a High School outcast he is now a a straight out evil Deity. Brady is equally stunning as the less dominant, but still evil counterpart to Pitt. They seem to be brothers, but we are never really absolutely sure? The great thing about their roles is that they are unsparingly polite. Gramatically correct and perfect to a tee. The kind of young men any parent would welcome to their house. This is when everything becomes completely twisted. For while they seem Angel-like, there is still an aura about their presence which leaves the viewer feeling uneasy and almost expecting the unexpected. The turn of events when the Angels become devils is almost to perfect not to detect their immediate transformation.The rest of the cast consists of the family being tortured. Naomi Watts, who readily plays the role of Mother and Father, since Tim Roth; who plays the father is incapacitated early in the film. Their young son; Devon Gearheart, does an incredibly convincing role as their terrified 10 year old son.I will say that Funny Games is anything ,but funny. If you want a happy American ending search elsewhere. This is a harsh statement on the American society's fascination with Horror and torture and displays just that. Gore hounds will also be disappointed, since all the death scenes take place off camera, but if you are looking for an entertaining film with originality and brilliant performances than give it a watch. Definitely one of the best from that year.",Funny Games
158,alexdelliott,"Thought provoking and disturbing, but not funny. This film is not meant to provide entertainment",7,11 April 2012,"I was recommended this film by a friend in the US due to my strong dislike for Hollywood clones and the violence and action that is glamorised within.STORY: Well there is not much to say about the story without giving spoilers, the plot is very unoriginal. If I was pressed to think of a film to compare Funny Games to it would be The Strangers. In Funny Games a family is terrorised by a couple of extremely polite sociopaths who make a bet that they can kill the husband, wife, and young boy within twelve hours, and what a tense twelve hours that turns out to be. However the lack of originality in the actual story, however intentional, means I can't give it a particularly high rating. 2/5EXECUTION: This is where the film really shines and is unlike anything I have ever seen (I haven't seen the original but I'm told it is exactly the same). This film deserves its 18 age rating not because of violence or profanity or sex, any nudity and most violence is not shown on screen and there really isn't that much of it. But it delivers highly emotional, tense and disturbing scenes that really aren't for the feint of heart. The techniques employed in this film are designed to sensitise the viewer to the violence shown in Hollywood films that we expect and show how it would play out in the real world. There are a number of times where the film teases the viewer with what they want to see (ie the kid escaping among others) only for it to be replaced with the cold reality of the situation. I will not go into more detail for fear of giving spoilers. The film also forced the viewer to become involved with the actions of the killers through the characters directly addressing the audience. The intention of this, I believe, is to question the viewer as to why they are watching this disturbing violent film when they know nothing good can come of it. This makes us question our own morality . The acting is also very good particularly from Michael Pitt and Naomi Watts. They really add to the tension and make the characters very convincing. 4/5VERDICT: I find it hard to recommend this film to anyone due to its disturbing and depressing nature. However I would say that people who are fed up with the way Hollywood portrays violence and in want of a new prospective on it would appreciate (although not necessarily enjoy) this film. I wouldn't say this film is to be enjoyed and its intention seems to be more to educate and provoke the audience to look inwards than to entertain. The games in this film are dark and disturbing, but they definitely aren't funny. 2 + 4 = 6/10",Funny Games

It's not about torture, humiliation, fear and murder as you might suppose. It's about movie script writing.This movie uses a counter image of the script you expect to receive as the viewer. Here are a few examples:Common scripts would keep the heroine alive - in this script she dies easily.Common scripts would keep the kid alive - in this script he's the first to die.Common scripts would employ two foul mouthed murderers dressed in black - this script has two polite boys dressed in white.Common scripts would ensure the heroine could make use of the knife left in the boat - in this script it doesn't help her.Common scripts would allow the heroine to shoot her assailant - in this script the plot is wound back after the assailant is shot (that's a clue to what the script is about).Common scripts would show the heroine partially naked - this script does not allow you that scene.That's just a few examples of what the director and script writer were doing with this movie.

161,klheintz,Nothing special to see here.,4,3 November 2016,"Funny Games is focused on 2 young psychopaths who have some serious mental problems and an obsession with violence. Now the plot is absolutely nothing special... It is the basis of so many movies that also add other things into it. This one does not.Many reviewers claim it to be very disturbing but, to be honest, there's not much violence displayed. It's more so just implied and even then there's barely anything unsettling about it except for one or two scenes.Roth serves almost no purpose in the film and I feel like he doesn't have near enough dialogue. Watts does a great job displaying emotions as well as her child in the movie. The psycho brothers do a good job playing psychopaths but their performances are still nothing you haven't seen before.The breaking of the 4th wall in the movie felt out of place and had almost no impact. It just felt really weird. I know this is a remake almost shot for shot of a movie from the 90's so maybe it struck home a little more than it did here. It's like they tried to intellectualize the movie but in all honesty you can't do so. This is a simply dumb movie.Overall it's not a terrible put together film.

Pretty much the same as the original and just as bad, I'm sure film students will lap this up which pretty much sums everything up nicely.

164,Bigbang,You might hate it or love it but everyone should give this a chance,8,2 April 2009,"One way to get the most out of Funny Games is to have your expectations open before watching it. It's not a standard horror film aiming to fulfill your needs as a viewer. It's about horror films and us, the audience who gets pleasure from suffering as entertainment. It shows what real horror might look like in an awful situation, and how it psychologically debilitates and paralyzes the people involved.Although this is almost identical and I liked this remake, I prefer the 1997 Austrian original version. It was one of the most disturbing and effective films I've ever seen. Here the acting is good especially from one of the best actresses out there Naomi Watts, but somehow the original works better. Maybe it was Arno Frisch, who played the main bad guy in the original, an absolutely ice cold character. Arno played it so well, there was a threatening menace underneath the polite and clean-cut exterior. Michael Pitt in this U.S. Version doesn't quite have that, but even so I still think he does well.One possible flaw that I agree with others is the family seemed too passive. In the beginning the two bad guys are armed with only a golf club. Naomi Watt's, who is in amazing shape at 40, looked like she might have done something more to get out of it. However, an argument can be made that the family reacted realistically because they were portrayed as rich, docile people who listened to classical music and went boating. People who are not violent and erroneously think everyone, even these two sick guys, have a better nature they can appeal to by simply saying ""why don't you just leave us alone and go?"" They've been sheltered from people who are simply evil and lack empathy and just don't give a sh*t. Their comfortable existence has been shattered and they don't know how to react. We're so used to Hollywood b.s. where everyone is a hero and fights back and we all cheer and go home. Yeah that's entertaining too but we've seen that a million times already. Maybe some people would be paralyzed out of fear like this family. Either way, I was willing to put their passiveness aside because everything else in the film was done so well.The original right now has a rating of 7.7 at IMDb and many glowing reviews, yet this U.S version is a lot lower at 6.4 and many b*tching and moaning 1 star reviews. Not to sound condescending, but maybe people who watch subtitled non-English films are more accepting of weird, offbeat films that don't follow conventional Hollywood style dialogue, plot and presentation, and they're more open to this movies style of direction, like the very long takes of people just sitting there in misery. I'm not stupid enough to say one has to like this film, I get annoyed at some indie type films and their quirkiness myself, but some of the 1 star reviewers sound like a bunch of crybabies.Funny Games slaps you in the face and taunts you and it rarely gives in to what you need as a viewer, and that may be frustrating at times but at least it's something different.",Funny Games
165,stevehoyland,Remake or Clone?,4,21 November 2020,"Two strange young men turn up at the holiday home of a family-of-three, subjecting them to a night of abject terror as they play their ""Funny Games"".As I'm sure most film aficionados out there will agree, remakes of earlier movies can be quite good on occasion - adding to the script or making a few other changes such as digital effects, all of which improve on the previous release. However, 10 years Is a rather short time period to produce a new version (think ""War of the Worlds""), particularly when the remake has an almost identical script, scene by scene and In both events and dialogue. This film Is almost identical to It's predecessor, which beggars the question - what was the point?The only difference between the two films Is simply that the original has German dialogue - and so we non-German speakers have to 'suffer' the inconvenience of subtitles or dubbing!While this newer version Is pretty good If viewed without knowledge of the original, It lacks the menace and originality of the first. I'd suggest watching the German version prior to this, If only for comparison and evaluation.
In summary, It would surely have been more worthwhile had the script, scenes and/or dialogue been altered, even just a little - after all, If the original was so good as to be copied almost word-for-word, then why an identical remake In the first place?As an original, I'd have given a rating of seven. But taking everything In to consideration, especially the lack of originality (identical remake) and, In my opinion, the weaker cast, I've given a rating of tfour (although 4.5 would have been my option If available). With regards to my 'weaker cast' comment, I'm not for one moment being disrespectful to the actors as such. However, I feel they were miscast, especially Tim Roth, who just didn't seem to 'fit In' quite like those In the original.These are only my personal opinions. I respect the opinions of everyone - however much they differ from mine - and I hope this review stimulates debate and encourages the comparison of this film to It's predecessor",Funny Games
166,slayer_of_the_jugga_phuk,"Eh... it's pretty generic, to be honest.",6,8 April 2009,"Okay so don't mistake generic for everyday Hollywood action, it certainly isn't that. When I say generic I mean for the genre, there's nothing new here or really anything all too interesting.The film is about two younger gentlemen, ranging near the age of twenty each, who dress in a way that is far less than threatening. All white, as though prepared to play golf, nobody you would really think much of. They also seem a bit whimpy and almost limp in the wrist and so the typical American family is going to think very little of them. Well, it starts with one of them toying with a woman in her vacation home about desiring to borrow four eggs for undisclosed reasons. He breaks them on 'accident' and asks for more. These are then broken by a dog, to which he claims to fear, and through a series of somewhat amusing yet overly droll moments the woman becomes infuriated and demands they leave, even getting her husband involved in the scenario.Well, after a while the two young men decide to take the family, a wife, father, and a son, hostage and start to toy with their heads in various sadistic games of psychological torture, at least that's the impression I got that they were attempting. The family is ultimately butchered one at a time, the wife being given the most physically generous death by being drowned while given the most extreme mental disturbances of losing the man she loves and her son. The son gets the most brutal of it, being shot directly in the face (off screen, tasteful) by a shotgun for attempting to escape. The husband is tormented a good deal by a knife and eventually put out of his misery by a shotgun, again off screen.Overall there is nothing here that you haven't likely seen somewhere else. The psychotic young men are bland and uninteresting, but I will admit they give a fair amount of pleasure in their acting performance of truly seeming mentally ill. They behave with very child-like minds and banter between one another, making up various lies and just playing around. Neither one of them seems particularly bright although certainly not uneducated, something like well-taught spoiled rich kids who have limited expansion to begin with and only a decent enough memory.The way the film is shot is a bit drab and bizarre, it seemed like they were attempting to appear as though a home movie was filmed by a professional camera on a tripod. Imperfect shots, many standing positions, many events happening off screen suddenly while only some are caught on film. It was filmed well overall, and I was glad that they didn't attempt something overly artsy or abstract.But like I said, there's nothing here you're going to see that's new or really that interesting, the premise is simply two young men hold a family hostage and kill them one at a time while playing mind torture the whole time. If you like films like this, I would strongly recommend ""The Strangers"", a film released in the same year, instead. While it is still somewhat generic, it has much better cinematography and is masterful at the suspenseful atmosphere, truly an over looked gem. It perhaps would have been better without Liv Tyler, but that's nothing I can fairly complain about, the film needed at least one well known star in order to be recognized even as much as it was.As for Funny Games... if you have time on your hands and feel like watching a little generic sadism, it's certainly worth catching on Starz or HBO, but I wouldn't recommend renting or buying it. I enjoyed it to a degree, but I do not see myself rewatching it at any point in my life.",Funny Games

I think the makers wanted it to look real and so be chilling to watch, but it turns out boring and annoying after sometime.Most of the times I was pressing the fast forward button and skipping through long scenes but not everyone who has watched this movie may have had that privilege.In the end the only reason to bear this movie was that its concept appeals to people like me who like to watch a mix of horror and drama which sadly comes in bits and pieces and is quite predictable.

Well....... there's hardly any game, and hardly funny in ""Funny Games"". There's hardly any storyline, the acting is poor, there's hardly frighting scene, I could hardly imagine how this film got 6.4 out of 100 on IMDb.What I expected is some brilliant crime happening in Funny Games but there's none.

These days you get shot first then ask questions when strangers just walk into your house. They have one cell phone, yeah right between them. What amaze me is the fact that they allowed themselves to be victimized and wasted a lot of fighting back time with that self righteous thinking of ""this can't be happening to someone like us"" attitude. If they had been living in a crime filled area they would have done whatever was necessary to survive. But they allowed preppy baby face killers into their home because it was a rich country club like community and the boys were Caucasions like they were? So it must be okay even though they weren't even suppose to be able to get on the property without you letting them in and the dog was warning them. There is no reason why these two ""killer kids"" could have come in my home weaponless and tell me they are going to kill me and I do nothing but go along with it. They had nothing to lose risking their life fighting back. Little bastard got a golf club, then she should have get one two and go at it. The rifle was theirs. I prefer my movies with the mothers fighting tooth and nail killing the killers threatening her child. Screw the helpless family. Kill or be killed when protecting yourself.",Funny Games
171,jaypugh,Can't help but feel cheated and highly annoyed,4,12 June 2008,"You have surely read through these reviews and know the plot. It is simple really no matter how philosophical or deep people want to try to make it. At the core it is a strong horror film that many here claim it to be. Simple... Two boys decide to take a family hostage to torture them and kill them. Let me just say that if the movie had been played straight and not cheated the audience then both my wife and I would have at least seen some value in the movie. Obviously the acting is absolutely top notch. It isn't only Naomi Watts who is on her game (no golf pun intended). So what is the problem? One scene in particular but several things over all are the problem. When you invest yourself in a movie and you CARE about the characters then how can you NOT feel cheated when the author breaks all of the rules of a movie and takes a straight forward and harsh murder movie and turns it into a joke? Anyone who has seen the movie knows the scene I'm talking about. It appears that Ann, the mother is going to pull off the heroic justice you are on the edge of the seat waiting for and then she does! Yes, she kills one of them. WAIT! We can't let that happen. Paul, the main killer suddenly reaches for a DVD remote and rewinds what you are watching to before the heroine shoots he partner in crime. At this point my wife and I look at each other and say, ""What?!"" So now we are thinking, ""They have a new set of rules so she is going to use the remote and rewind the whole thing."" No such luck. OK, the next MAJOR problem although not as major as the stupid rewind trick on the audience when this is NOT a sci-fi film. What is the point with the ACID ROCK music suddenly blasting your speakers? It comes out of nowhere and for no reason. This almost made me stop the movie in the first 5 minutes and not even go further. It disturbed my wife to the point where she felt sick. NO JOKE! I did give her a hard time about it though. :) They then did it with a minute to go in the film. Again there is NO REASON! If the writer would have made the movie a straight forward film about two sick kids who think murder is entertainment then I could have lived with that because the acting was flawless but I can't stand being cheated like this movie has cheated me. If I had bought the DVD I would have broken it in half but it belongs to Blockbuster so I'm sending it back unharmed. :) Positives - Great acting, Great tension, Great directing Negatives - Everything is ruined by a story that breaks the rules of a movie. If it was consistent in what it did then that is one thing but to do it once... CHEAP and takes away the tension of the film and replaces tension with confusion. Other negative - Acid Rock blaring for no apparent reason but to make the audience unsettled. Why don't you just have someone hit me in the head with a brick? It would have the same effect!",Funny Games
172,Bill-276,Nothing to see here...keep moving folks...HOLY CRAP...!!!!,8,6 January 2011,"This is a film in which I cannot in good conscious recommend to a single person. Seriously, no one needs to see this movie. You can stop reading this review and search for another film title. Please. Please.If you haven't clicked away yet, than let me add that despite my inability to recommend this movie to a single person or living being in the known universe, it is quite a remarkable, genre-busting film. I had to stop it 6 times, wait 24 hours to recover, and then pick up where I left off (which thankfully indicates I'm normal. According to writer/director Haneke, ""...if you watch the film all the way through, there's something wrong with you"".) But I didn't turn away or turn it off for the reasons you may think. There's maybe 2 minutes of actual violence in the movie, and all of it is done off-camera. It is not a violent for violence-sake film (like say ""Natural Born Killers"" or ""Kalifornia""). And though I certainly see it's classification as torture porn, it's actually a little more complicated than simply that.Again I can't recommend this movie, but I also can't hate it. Anyone who does is falling into the director's trap. The movie taunts even it's target audience constantly. It's really no different than an Andy Kaufman stunt (and who thought, other than maybe Jim Carrey, that Andy Kaufman was funny in his lifetime?) Don't give Haneke the satisfaction of seeing the movie, or hating the movie if you do see it. There actually is some minimal social value in the film.

As a matter of fact, it is the combination of fascination and horror, plus the extreme loathsomeness of the two young men, played so well by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet, that made this movie so interesting! Because of their loathsomeness, one must feel sympathy for the innocent family preyed upon by them, played so well by Tim Roth, Naomi Watts, and Devon Gearhart!

175,Axel-9,Why?,6,23 October 2007,"When I heard Michael Haneke was re-making Funny Games in America I wondered why: what purpose could it possibly serve? The set-up to both versions is simple in that a bourgeois family is subjected to a torturous ordeal by a couple of ever so polite psychopaths. Moreover, like the original the re-make is a cruel exercise in exposing our fascination with the violence depicted in the media - the ""our"" specifically meaning the middle classes, comfortable in our existences and oblivious to the horrors of the world. However, Haneke is on record as saying that he always considered Funny Games to be an ""American story"", as he regarded the use of violence as a form of entertainment to be a specifically American phenomenon. No matter that this is a bit of a flawed viewpoint: having the aggressors seem straight out of the O.C. gives the impact of their sadistic actions an even more discomfiting air. Michael Pitt (charismatic and barbarous) and Brady Corbett (seemingly dopey but utterly vicious) are both excellent, but their performances leave one feeling a bit um ""seen it all before"". Which takes me back to my first thought: what is the point? Cosmetics aside this is exactly the same film, right down to the assumption that the well to do like to listen to classical music and that the audience may be unsettled by playing them some thrash metal. Haneke even has Pitt address the camera and manipulate the film, so re-using the trick about playing with reality and focusing the viewer on what actually counts as real. It is just that this playing around does not carry the impact it did 10 years ago. In fact, due to the unconventional nature of the film and the vast disparity it offers with reality it's hard to care much at all. Yes what happens is horrible, but it does not feel at all real. I'm waiting for someone to point out that, that is Haneke's point, but frankly, I don't care. No amount of intellectualising can make this watchable. You would think Haneke would know better too. His most recent film Hidden took a genre film and flipped it about to deliver one of the most surprising and intellectually challenging thrillers of the decade. By stringing the audience along and offering some sense of catharsis and understanding of character motivation he offered a way in. Funny Games U.S. offers no such intrigue or tension and is ultimately a big step backward. He may see it as an American story, but it worked better as a small Austrian film, set in anywheres-ville Europe.",Funny Games

These films offer that thirst quenching feeling that Tool - Vicarious defines in the lyrics. I say dont critcize and go for the ride; shocking? disturbing? wrong?.. good your morals are still intact. Compassion for such victims is also a positive result as it makes you realize the ordeal and reality of such things; just think how fortunate a viewer is to not be in that situation and still, it hits us hard and makes us feel grotesquified. Your anger towards the offenders become easily ascertained, your anger towards the family not doing everything in their power to stop it because they are too terrified is also there, making you realize that courage, if well calculated, can be a huge benefit even if it may become more of a sacrificial bad decision.

Gratuitous Violence? This was Stupid Irritating Violence. Then there's the foolishness of the victims; it grated on me from the beginning. From the misbehaving, barking dog to the lackadaisical behaviour of the father and the willingness of the mother to have her son hurt for her own modesty, I didn't care whether they lived or died, except for the kid. I cared about the kid and I wanted the maniacs to pay for their idiotic sadism, but in the end I was left wondering why the German version was considered so ""good"" that the director re-made it. While I realize that we were supposed to hate the antagonists of the story, it may have been a little more interesting if they were more believable. It is unlikely that two skinny weaklings looking decidedly insane-looking with their white gloves and inbred looks could gain the trust of not one but three rich families living behind gates on a private lake, and proceed to get the better of them with mere head games. I can suspend belief if I'm entertained. I can stomach violence if it drives the plot in a satisfying way. This was neither entertaining or satisfying. Why did I continue watching? Because after suffering through the first half, I wanted some sort of gratification to make it worth my while. Nope.",Funny Games
179,Wolf30x,Major Disappointment,3,22 August 2008,"I hate to say it, but this is one of those movies that actually makes you think less of the actors for having decided to star in it. The premise had potential, and with Tim Roth and Naomi Watts in the lead roles, you'd think it'd be it'd be a surefire thriller. Instead, this film delvers pretty much nothing. It's not very thrilling or scary. It doesn't really make much in the way of social commentary. So if anything, it's just an annoying movie. My main problem with this movie is that it tries to be clever in an over the top way. At a few points, the people terrorizing the family even turn to the camera to point out what a valiant effort they are making as characters to defy the usual movie clichés. To make things worse, this is the kind of movie that genuinely had the potential to be genuinely thrilling. It starts out building in a slow and unexpected manner so that once the family realizes what is happening to them, it's too late. Then there's the violence. One thing that actually is clever about Funny Games is the fact that all of the violence is implied. Much of the tension that builds is because we don't always know what's happening to the characters, especially when they're in their most taxing situations. Unfortunately, the director opted for a far too anti-climactic ending. I still don't even know what to make of the ending. There's no tension at the end. No surprises. It just stops. An not in some sort of abrupt cliff-hanger way either. It just coasts into the credits.So in my opinion, there are a ton of other movies you should see instead of this, depending on what you were hoping to get out of it. If you liked the premise, then you'd be better off with 2008's The Strangers. If you want something to genuinely unsettle you, go with Session 9. if you want something that will shock and offend you, go see The Rules of Attraction.

181,mickran,A cliché ridden slasher movie dressed up in art house clothing,1,5 July 2008,"I'm afraid I learned nothing from this movie. It isn't a smart satire on the detached upper middle classes and how they put up a gate between themselves and the violent world outside. It isn't a dark comedy of manners. It's really just a slow paced slasher movie promoting and celebrating mindless violence for entertainment. It has about as much social significance as I Know What You Did Last Summer. I particularly despise the use of killing a child for nothing more than shock value. If you are distracted by the art house aesthetic and use of cinematic and audio editing techniques and don't agree then I'd like to present the classic horror/slasher/suspense scenario for your consideration. Spoiler: One of the victims escapes the clutches of the psychos and runs into the deserted neighbourhood only to flag down a vehicle driven by - yes you guessed it, one of the psychos who brings her straight back to the house where she was originally imprisoned. It's played a little differently as he isn't the driver of the first car she sees but it's the same tired old trite cliché you've seen before so many times.As for the excruciatingly predictable ending, I really could have written the last line myself half way through the movie, (sealed in in an envelope and posted it to myself and it would have been delivered before the end of the movie which felt like forever in arriving). And it has one of those endings that you think to yourself 'is that is?' And unfortunately 'that is it'. A movie about two motiveless two dimensional psycho killers with no explanation or conclusion to satisfy the viewer. It addresses the issue of violence and its affects on an ineffectual society just about as much as the latest Rambo movie does. It seeks to do so and aims but misses by a mile.

From a philosophical and psychological viewpoint, the movie is a masterpiece. From the viewpoint of a normal viewer, including myself, it's more of a lesson in self-observation than a real piece of entertainment. I can simply describe it as the author's own exercise in psychology, a source of food for thought, but not a source of viewing pleasure.If you haven't seen the film yet, my advice is to examine your own mood first: if you're happy and want something entertaining, skip this one.

That doesn't happen with me all that often, I usually always give the film Im watching a chance. And maybe it was what I knew before seeing the film was what brought this judgement on.For a start, its the same director making the same film over again. I thought why? Whats the point? Easy way to make more money I suppose. Second, and this has always bugged me, it's just a movie about torture. Whats the reason behind it? There's no thought behind it, 'lets just beat people up for 90 minutes'. Anybody with a camera could do that. I mean I appreciate some movies that try to make a point of violent issues in the world, but 'Funny Games' just doesn't make that point in a thought provoking way.It tells the story of a family who are held hostage at home by two twisted guys. Simple as that. They begin by killing the dog with a golf club. The whole scene leading up to Naomi Watts finding the dog in the boot of her car just looked silly to me and not very believable. I wasn't a fan of Watts in King Kong, and she isn't that great here, but in 21 Grams for example she was excellent, so I can only describe her as inconsistent.As the movie progresses, the two men continue their torture of the family, with the husband unable to do much about it after having his leg taken out by a golf club. In the role of the husband is Tim Roth, who is poor in this movie, barely any lines and a terrible contrast to the likes of performances seen in Pulp fiction and Reservoir Dogs.'Funny Games' is a little creepy in points, and hey, some of you may enjoy it, but it just bugged me.

186,sean73267326,"Hypocritical and pompous, but decent... I guess.",5,7 July 2014,"Michael Haneke sure knows how to make skin crawl. His 2005 film Caché, despite never revealing its cards once or depicting anything other than a middle class family in crisis, had a desperately seedy, perverse feeling to it. His first film, Benny's Video, is similarly disturbing, and even his 2012 magnum opus Amour had its fair share of nasty moments. The Notebook it was not. If I had thought he'd remake any of his films in English, I would have hedged my bets on these three, particularly the former-most.His famously nasty 1997 film Funny Games is an odd choice, though. It's not very commercial, it has no real audience appeal (which I'll get to) and it's also the kind of film you see once and never really want to see again because, really, it's a gimmick film. A one trick pony. Who was he trying to get to attend this film? Subtitle fearing anti-commercial hipsters? I don't think they exist.Anyways, whatever about *who* would watch it, as the emphasis of this review is, well, why. At its most basic level, Funny Games is an endurance test. Haneke subjects us to an hour and a half of unthinkable psychological cruelty inflicted upon a seemingly very nice white upper- middle class to see how long we last. If we last the whole film, we're monsters, if we walk out, we get the satisfaction of nodding our heads in shame at the level of violence in the film industry. Yayyy.Therein lies the problem. There's no doubt that that's Haneke message, as the it's too narrow and focused to really point anywhere else. And yet it doesn't find anything interested to say about this point; it lets it hang in the air, demonstrating them instead of discussing them. I get it, films are violent. Why are they violent? What effect have they? Why?But no, Haneke prefers to (very hypocritically, I might add) inflict violence and cruelty on its characters. It wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't so in your face. Fourth wall breaks, a bizarre twist and several red herrings do their best to make us feel ashamed for what we're watching, and without anything interesting to say, they're pointless.So where does that leave the rest of the film? It's good... I guess. I must be a horrible person for saying that, but it's at least efficient. It's very, very well acted, the cinematography is excellent, the direction is pristine, the action is somewhat involving... I could go on. It really just depends on how well you tolerate violence and cruelty. If you're going for the message, however, just don't bother. You're better off not even turning the film on. That way, you're safe in the knowledge you've beaten Haneke at his own game.",Funny Games
187,robertandrews-44556,"Brutal, shocking, savage, and funny-FUNNY GAMES",10,8 October 2019,"This 2007 Michael Haneke American remake of his own 1997 German film of the same name is definitely not for everybody. It is twisted and violent, though by no means overly gory. It is also not exactly terrifying, as Haneke himself has stated that this film and his 1997 original were never intended to be horror films. However, the film certainly is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is pretty savage and brutal in parts.The film is a shot-by-shot remake of the original 97 film, and the plot is ridiculously simple. A family of three, Ann (Naomi Watts), George (Tim Roth), and their young son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) are on vacation, planning on having a relaxing week at their vacation home on the lake in an upper-class countryside. Shortly after arriving, they greet their neighbours who are accompanied by two mysterious clean-cut and overly polite young men named Peter and Paul (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) who are dressed all in white. Shortly after requesting some eggs and apparently accidentally dropping a phone into a sink, Peter and Paul take the family hostage and force them to partake in emotionally and physically brutal torture games.The film is a pretty surreal and engaging experience with a deep meaning to it. Throughout the film, Paul often addresses us (the audience) and makes us feel somewhat guilty about watching the violence on-screen. Both villains appear to not be real villains per se, but rather two characters forced to take their villanoius roles as they feel it is we, the audience, who desires it. Lines such as ""Why are we doing this? It's difficult to talk about it"", and, ""Please don't beg for your life... This is hard for me just as it is hard for you"" seemingly give us the message that even the two villains don't really want to kill, but it's what the audience wants.That is not to say that they are not creepy and sometimes appear to even enjoy what they are doing. Their bizarre antics, such as Peter's childlike innocent behaviour and their complete confusion as to the question, ""Why are you doing this?"" is pretty unsettling. It all mixes excellently together, and the brutal force of the film is often coated over with scenes of black comedy, such as the two villains continously asking for eggs, only to keep dropping them and breaking them.I love this film. Really, I don't know why. I think it is just the complete weirdness of it that draws me in-yes, I am talking about YOU, ""Remote Control scene"". Plus, the excellent talents of Pitt and Corbet portraying these two psychotic, yet friendly, serial killers makes the movie all the more entertaining. Both actors did such an amazing job and had such a creepy and believable chemistry together. You really feel, while watching it, that these two have been friends for a long time and have done this torture to so many other families. And you do get a kick out of them. They will scare you, but they will also make you laugh with classic lines such as, ""What are these people going to think of you if you don't watch your figure? "", ""So much stress for politeness sake"", ""Make sure you don't make a mess of the carpet"" and my favourite, (right after they have broken the husband's leg and are introducing themselves officially to the family), ""I'm Paul. This is Peter. Come and shake the man's hand, where are your manners?"" .This Funny Games, and its original, have every right to become cult classics in the future. I love them both.10/10",Funny Games

189,LuckyMatt93,A brilliant and horrifying look at movie violence,9,18 April 2009,"Grim and relentless, Funny Games USA has much more on its mind than just startling displays of blood and terror. It's tame in it's depiction of sadism (though the very nasty effects are underscored in long takes). It keeps the physical stuff off camera entirely, relying instead on the actors and their expressions/reactions to the horror that occurs in order to get the point across. Scene after scene the actors show the effects of emotional and physical stress. Naomi Watts, in particular, really succeeds at this. Her reactions to the behavior of Michael Pitt and Bradly Corbett are a lot more unsettling and memorable than any amount of violence the screen can toss at us. In short, she reminds us that we're watching a human being suffer through a truly horrific situation. It may not be exactly fun, but you came to see a horror film, right?And therein rests the focus of the film. Without spoiling it for anyone, a large part of what happens in this examines not only the culture of movie violence, but also the audience that enjoys watching it. When Tim Roth asks why they don't just kill the family now, Michael Pitt simply tells him, ""You shouldn't forget the importance of entertainment."" You see, this is one of the reasons why the film works so damn well. On one level, it makes viewers pay for its implied violence. On another level, the film pushes its point harder. At first, Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet seem like standard movie psychos, like Norman Bates or Hannibal Lector. But then Pitt begins to break the fourth wall and address the audience, asking what ""you"" might want to see. When at last he stops a scene that has gone ""wrong"", he grabs a TV remote, rewinds it, and replays it to accommodate his own ends, the film has jumped from regular horror into meta territory. At once very smart and difficult to see, it is, ironically, all about watching. As viewers, we serve as witnesses to an innocent family's torment and as such, Haneke implies that we're just as responsible as the villains. It's an interesting angle to bring into this sort of film as it challenges the viewer by asking what it is they're looking for when they come to a horror movie. How Funny Games proceeds to then toy with those expectations will, without a doubt, divide viewers: charming some while enraging others.But it's not all social commentary and fancy art-house material. If there's one thing that many of today's horror films fail to provide, it's suspense. Funny Games definitely has it. The suspense and tension is so tight and gripping that it becomes almost unbearable at times, and Haneke's camera is often sedentary for such extended periods that the viewer begins to fear that danger may come at any minute.This is easily one of the best and most intriguing horror movies from this decade. It's tied with the original Austrian version, as they're both equally as good.",Funny Games
190,katdakay,mind games,9,21 March 2008,"""Funny Games"" is hysterical; whether you view it as a commentary on the ubiquity of violence in cinema or just plain torture porn, it was definitely sufficient in capturing my attention as deftly as the film's murderers captured their victims. It begins with the most domestic and simple of requests; the film's antagonists in white knock upon the family's door with the most simple of requests-the neighbors want to borrow some eggs, can I have some please?--and transforms drastically into a masterpiece of sadism and torture. Naomi Watts does an excellent job as the traumatized mother, but the real stars here are the deliciously evil villains with impeccable table manners.",Funny Games
191,kimberlymhn,"Watch 'Storm Warning', then you'll understand 'Funny Games'.",8,20 April 2008,"Some reviewers seem to miss what Haneke is doing in this movie and need to have a look at a 'conventional' rich people in peril movie like the Australian 'Storm Warning' to see how the whole genre is subverted. The original 'Funny Games' played to an 'art house' audience, many of whom were unaccustomed to the kind of horror movies it aimed to examine.In 'Funny Games' (both versions), the wealthy family are invaded, but in 'Storm Warning' it is the wealthy who break into the home of the 'villains'. They then proceed to look down their noses at them even though they've provided them with shelter and generally do everything to get into their bad books. The 'heroes' never apologise for what they do and despite being told there are no phones or main roads they keep on asking as if what the boonies say doesn't count and rather than be relieved they have some shelter, the heroine calls her hosts 'cavemen'. In the first act it is clearly the wealthy who are breaking the rules with their disregard for the privacy of the country dwellers, yet we are supposed to sympathise with them because they are 'cultured' as opposed to the ugly, dirty antagonists. After the incapacitation of the male, the woman predictably engineers the demise of their captors via some truly nonsensical plot developments, but of course its OK, because the script has demonised the 'evil' trio and they were 'fighting for their lives'. But by the same token, were not the 'bad guys' equally justified in killing them, as the heroes placed themselves in a position where it would be foolhardy for the trio to release them. In 'Funny Games', the tormentors are not unwashed half-wits, but as clean and cultured as their victims. They play out their cruel games with civility which is at odds with their malice. All the usual things happen, but the family are indeed doomed as unlike 'Storm Warning', the heroine does not out of nowhere develop incredible survival skills. The horror audience normally endures the suffering of the heroes in anticipation of their violent revenge, but in 'Funny Games' this does not happen. Unlike the antagonists in 'Storm Warning' they have no reason to kill and they do not make the kind of silly mistakes which litter the Australian movie.Audiences who are conditioned to seeing good prevail over evil are left empty when we see the last family member murdered and the homicidal couple move on to another set of victims. We are not even given some kind of reason why they had to die. Some have used the rather silly term 'torture porn' to describe this 'Funny Games', but it is a much more sophisticated work than anything churned out by the makers of 'Hostel'. There are no gory special effects or gruesome death scenes, no high tempo chase sequences, just a lot of restrained tension. In terms of the production, Naomi Watts is less effective than Susanne Lothar was in the original. When Peter & Paul made Lothar strip in the original the feeling of shame was much stronger, because her body looked looked like that of a normal woman, unlike the highly toned Ms Watts. Also while Lothar gets dressed immediately after her humiliation. Ms Watts seems too comfortable in her underwear. Tim Roth is passable in his role, but it would have been interesting to see an actor like Matt 'Jason Bourne' Damon or Keifer 'Jack Bauer' Sutherland cast, who we'd expect prevail in a physical encounter placed in his powerless state. Though inferior to the original, 'Funny Games' is an effective experiment which plays with the perceptions of the audience, and it works even better if compared to the likes of 'Storm Warning'",Funny Games

You see Michael Haneke is the director of both films, one made in Austria in 1997, and the other due for release this year which received a full Hollywood treatment including big name stars. I was lucky enough to see the film at the Glasgow Film Festival, and was surprised at what I experienced.Funny Games (U.S.) is not an enjoyable film to watch, and it's not meant to be. This is an uncomfortable and difficult experience that turns the tables on the audience a number of times and puts the spotlight on them.

194,whineycracker2000,"Art, like the truth, can be both painful and revealing",9,2 July 2021,"In his preface for 'Dorian Gray"", Oscar Wilde states ""Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital."" Funny Games fits the bill.Perhaps one of the most polarizing (American) horror films of the last couple of decades, Funny Games was destined, if not designed, to incite controversy and dissection, and of course, its mission was accomplished in spades. The fact that there is a seemingly endless array of impassioned arguments by ardent supporters and haters reveals some hard-won truths: mainly, that people will go to surprising lengths to prove to others why their opinion is the most sound (one reviewer called the film offensive trash for being too well made-one of the more curious assessments I've come across). Yet what's most fascinating to me is that at the end of the day, both parties are actually defending screen violence; it's how the violence is presented that is the bone of contention.The film is a boldly confrontational exercise that works as a sort of exposure-response deconstruction of torture porn that challenges its viewers to question their own reactions to it. The conceit alone had already divided many viewers long before they laid eyes on the first frame. As with partisan politics, one must either be 100% on board or completely opposed; Haneke is either a smug condescending prick or a genuinely curious filmmaker who is using his medium to get people to think about issues that plague him, right? Does he respect his audience or hold contempt for them? Is he punishing them for showing up? Does he believe violence should be used sparingly or avoided altogether? Does he want his viewers to reflect or merely submit? Does he even know? Regardless, his integrity certainly lies in the balance.As a horror film, Funny Games rattles its viewers in ways reminiscent of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre; like Hooper, Haneke diverts the camera away from the action when a character is being brutalized, suggesting rather than showing. He has an uncanny sense of timing, is exacting with how long he allows a shot to linger to elicit an intended emotional response from his audience, and knows instinctively how to undermine the viewer's sense of security and safety. The presentation (notice I used the word representation not display) of suffering and torture inflicted on the three members of this upper-class family may be painful to watch, but it is not cinematic masochism for masochism's sake, as some have argued. Real-life violence does not appear in the same sensationalized, cartoonish fashion that it does in most modern-day horror films, and Funny Games doubles down on this point. The film's emphasis on raw brutality is intended to make viewers consider content within context, not to titillate.Many criticize Funny Games for committing what Roger Ebert referred to as the ""idiot plot"" device, where characters make patently stupid and illogical decisions to prevent the movie from being over too soon. This couldn't be further from the truth. The film is based on a true event after all, and if you were to ask real survivors of home invasions, they will probably all tell you the same thing- that fear had rendered them incapable of making the type of heroic decisions that the audience members expect to see played out in horror films.Would Funny Games work without the self-aware, 4th wall-breaking tournament of torture our psychotic Ferris Buellers inflict on both the characters and audience? Absolutely. Hypothetically, let's say Haneke nixed the meta-factor, scaled back on the torture sequences, but kept the more straightforward thriller elements: the result would undoubtedly prove to be a commercially viable and highly watchable scare-fest (the scene where the son runs to the neighbors for help and discovers the dead family, for example, is terrifying without being graphic-and recalls some of the most chilling moments from the best of the genre classics). Haneke is a master of suspense in a way Hitchcock would have appreciated and he earns his right to break the rules to achieve something deeper. A lesser filmmaker would be a hypocrite if he could not first prove an expert of his craft before diving into deeper waters.Experiencing this film in the theatre for the first time was indeed a disturbing experience, but it was the audience's reactions that were the most unsettling. During one scene, for example, when the son wets his pants after being hooded by one of the film's teenage villains, about 1/4 of the audience burst out into laughter. This was certainly not meant to be funny. In fact, it was one of the most heartbreaking moments in the film. It was then that I realized that Haneke's film actually did serve a purpose because it actually exposed me to a segment of the population that I naively did not know existed (indeed, there are people who find humor in suffering). It also got me questioning my own reaction: was I just being too uptight and taking it all way too seriously?Love it or hate it, Funny Games will get your cerebral juices flowing. For that alone, it merits praise. And the more that one refuses to acknowledge the incredible amount of craftsmanship and artistry on display here, or tries to convince others why it is a pretentious flaming pile of garbage, the more that individual validates the film's status as contributive art-and the more Haneke has called their bluff. After all, to quote the film's tagline, ""You brought this upon yourself"". Did you not?",Funny Games

They showed much less than normal interest in events going on around them (I am not a dog owner, but if I owned one and he was barking I would check to see why), and took no real action to try to survive. This was not a psychological thriller, with you wondering what was going to happen, it was an exercise in tolerance, wondering when these pathetic excuses for human beings were going to try something to give themselves a chance to live. At one point when the kid runs off I had a shred of hope that he would do something intelligent, but he failed miserably. My wife commented, as we watched his weak attempts to climb a fence, that any kid she knew at that age could climb fences, trees, etc. And maybe I am a better man than most (if the portrayal of the husband is supposed to be typical male), but I'd be dead or nearly so before I would permit my wife and kid to be brutalized and degraded. This was a very disappointing movie, in the summary I state I cannot believe people like this exist, I am not referring to Peter and Paul, we know psychos are out there.

Before long, there are two gentlemen...And they refuse to leave. Director Michael Haneke remakes his 1997 film of the same name, allegedly identically duplicating his original film for a wider audience in the west. 'Funny Games' breaks down the horror genre into a form which demonstrates how violence is viewed by today's modern generation.Having not seen the original, I decided to commit to some research before watching this. Often with a remake, various important aspects are changed to modernise the film to fit into contemporary criteria. In the case of 'Funny Games U.S', it is generally accepted that this remake is a ""shot for shot"" replication, with the exception of some negligible technicalities.Many have complained and enquired as to why this film was remade, as often the reproduction never fares well against the rudimentary predecessor. However, if one looks closely and pays attention, it is more than evident as to the reasoning. Haneke is trying to bring about the realisation of the current trend within the horror genre; being the fascination with violence as entertainment.The horror within this film is more character based, which is what the essence of a scary movie should be about. I've never personally been too interested by the generic escapist horror films of the western film industry. There is never generally a sense of realism, and often revolves around a suspension of disbelief creating a vaguely entertaining couple of hours, which for the most part were probably more fun for the special effects team rather than the audience. In the case of 'Funny Games' we have a clever twist on the genre, where the fear is composed of character traits rather than actions and special effects, which make for a much more disturbing factor. The characters personalities are brought about primarily through their facial expressions and their physical mannerisms, making this the only justified remake out there. It is difficult to concentrate on these visual aspects whilst reading subtitles, which is where for natively English-speaking viewers; the aspect would be lost in the original.These traits are brought about by a great cast; Michael Pitt is quite possibly the star of the film giving us some particularly chilling glares and genuinely frightening idiosyncrasies. Whilst Roth and Watts gave some great performances too, there were some moments where they felt a little unrealistic. However, this does not write them off from the film, their efforts here are to be commended tremendously, for it's no surprise if either one said they played challenging roles. There are a lot of one-take scenes; in which there is only one camera angle. Whilst there is an accumulative awareness of a relatively fast pace, the suspended shots are in actuality quite long. This is not initially realised, being that these prolonged shots are totally absorbing and bring you directly into the film, and in parts making you feel like you are actually there with the characters. This aspect is scrutinised by the film though, rhetorically questioning emotions you might feel whilst watching the film. Albeit, certain aspects of the film feel distinctly realistic, you are often reminded that this film is entertainment, but are also asked if it is entertaining.In the opening sequence, these extended angles also give a somewhat visually relaxed and light-hearted feeling, which ultimately add to any discontent that might be felt during certain events of the film. In spite of this, these protracted shots are a clear indication of why some audiences might turn off and become bored. Furthermore, certain audiences might be dissatisfied that this is not a typically predictable film. The only technically established connection is with Pitt's character, which for fans of escapism, this is less than gratifying. Though, for viewers with a more sacrificial mindset, this is greatly pleasing.Another notably interesting feature to this film; is the use of two musical genres for the soundtrack. Classical, and Thrash Metal. These two genres directly reference the characteristics of Pitt's character; whilst one represents his physical demeanour, the other represents his mentality. The classical music also refers to Roth, Watts and Devon Gearhart. Gearhart is the son of Roth and Watts, who for his age gives a brilliantly realistic performance.From this point on it's quite grandiose to present a vague insight into the remaining elements of this film without spoiling anything too much. This is a film full of surprises being more of a thriller than a horror film, though ultimately it's hard to think anything other than ""this is strange"". It seems to be a film purposefully orientated around affecting mindsets and satirically sniping at the modern horror genre.It's hard to place a specific niche here, for it is somewhere in the middle of a thriller and a horror, which is quite possibly why it is still struggling to break even. Unfortunately I am unable to find the gross revenue for the original film, though it is fair to say chances are it made profit due to the several awards it won.This is most definitely not a film for an average slasher/splatter horror fan, for its objectives will simply be neglected or misunderstood. Regardless, this film is still worth a view by anyone with a serious interest in film. I rate this 9 out of 10, for it's very captivating and intriguing, with well designed characters and a great script. Haneke and his crew have done a superb job on this, and based on this remake of a film I've not seen, I look forward to digging up and watching his various other projects.",Funny Games
203,dumontaaron55-1,The desensitized corpse of an intelligent movie,1,19 August 2009,"By Aaron Dumont Zero Stars (out of 4)It's unfair that Funny Games U.S. (2008) is compared to one of the all-time greatest movies - Pasolini's death-contract opus Salo - because of the violence. However, one of these movies actually has a point; the other doesn't. Salo was a work of passion, of love and of beauty. It is lively, complex and peerless in its difficult-to-find understanding of humanity and human nature. In its chaos, and, as independent filmmaker Bill Mousoulis put it, narrative 'circles', the ideas there are intensified to extremities; it's more dazzling and profound than any Bergman, or Godard. On the other hand, Haneke's Funny Games U.S. is in fact a morally dead, clueless piece of sadism and pretension, and one without brains at that. It's intellectually and emotionally dull. It's misguided and repulsive. There's nothing to it. There's no anatomy. There's no feeling. It functions like it's a masterpiece, when it's more of a misguided mistake. Pasolini wasn't out for revenge or shock when he made Salo. He was out to challenge, question and engage in frank and poetic ways. His movie was personal and fearless, and put expression and freedom out on the line. Haneke, however, comes across as if he is out for just about nothing (or if he was, then he simply failed trying). Funny Games U.S. is hypocritical and cowardly. The movie itself, the very one trying to catch the audience for their cynicism and their shamelessness for entertainment, becomes a work of cynicism and shamelessness. It has nothing to say, and I doubt it wants to, either. The movie has no emotion and is completely impersonal. The movie begins with an upper-class couple on vacation. Then, two young men come in, ask for some eggs, steal a golf club, smash the father's leg and tie them all up. It gets worse from there. The violence portrayed in the movie serves as a a critique on the audience and our need for entertainment at whatever cost. The two torturers actually acknowledge they are in the movie, but the inept ""critique"" is lost as the movie progressively scream the message louder and louder in you ear. The director would've been better off running into the frame to shout ""You are a bad person because you're watching this!""Though the family's pain really gets to me, it doesn't bother me that much. it's when all that torture is set to play right along such dubious moral lessons, artsy moping and self-importance that really makes me upset. Haneke is at times a good, but not great moviemaker. Unfortunately, Haneke, in making such a noxious, blunt and - in a highly ironic sense - mindless movie, not only makes such a spectacular failure of craft and intelligence, but makes himself out as a fraud, a hypocrite and a dictator.I felt battered and puzzled by the movie during, but by the end, I felt empty. At least many other awful movies give you a feeling, a pulse. At least some movies need second viewings to catch it all, to understand it more. As one wise man once said, ""When I leave a theater and understand all of what I saw before, then I know it's not much good."" When I finished this movie, I got it all. Oh, But *No*, you see, it's All Good! It's metafiction, a dark prank! It's Art with a Capital *A*!Unfortunately, however, this is not art. It's just trash.",Funny Games

It's like with The Office series (UK vs. US) Only Jim and Pam can be Jim and Pam. This film is a classic. I adore its every moment of calculated randomness.

That's an achievement, isn't it? I haven't seen the original German version (a blow by blow account directed by Heneke himself)but, I must confess, I think I will, I think I want to. Don't ask me why. This is as empty as anything I've ever seen. A public act of obscenity and yet you can't, you just can't look away. Naomi Watts is terrific as the smart middle class wife and mother that will notice for first that Michael Pitt is not that good an actor. She sees through him - who wouldn't? - pretty much from the start. Michael Pitt plays the creep as a creep with good manners. So on the nose that doesn't manage to be frightening. He is shocking because of what he does but not for what he appears to be. He has no sexual presence. Tim Roth, as the weakling husband is disturbingly convincing and the young actor playing their son is truly wonderful. So here I am, talking about a film I kind of detested with unexpected respect. Michael Heneke may be one of those artists who are extraordinary self promoters, but he's an artist none the less and like real artist often do, divide, confront and provoke. So, did I like ""Funny Games""? No. Will I see it again? Absolutely.",Funny Games
211,crey014,Haneke recycles his brilliant directing from the original and with that; it is even more curious why this one has to be made in the first place.,7,24 July 2008,"Michael Haneke is a cinematic terrorist: able to synthesize terror from original stories, bound as an assault to the humdrum of the middle class. On that note, it came as a surprise as he helms an almost shot-by-shot remake of his 1997 ""Funny Games"", a decade after its debut at Cannes. What may have looked good on paper as a proposed analysis to American violence, the new picture somehow dilutes the power of the original and along with it, emphasizes the story's purpose as sensationalist cinema.As the film opens with a bird's eye view of a white family vehicle, we follow the lives of Ann, George and Georgie  a fairly typical upper middle class family driving to their family holiday house, a small yacht in tow. What starts off as a pleasant drive accompanied by classical music, heavy metal music booms through the audiences' speakers as the opening credits roll, the family unaware of the torture the intense music heavily foreshadows. This opening sequence basically summarizes the whole ordeal. Antagonists Paul and Peter, picking up random houses and propose a dastardly game: that the homeowners wouldn't be alive when the clock strikes 12 hours later.Watts uses the film to function as a medium to show off her acting muscles. And rightly so, as the maternal figure, Ann, practically begs for her life and if it weren't for the paternal character, the movie would be borderline misogynistic. To contrast with the original version, what used to be the Ulrich Mühe character has been reduced to an even more pathetic George (Roth), unable to defend his family after an initial blow to his shins by a 3-Iron. The family acquires empathy from the get-go, right when Peter comes in to ask for a couple of unthreatening couple of eggs, to the audience fault as this feeling of compassion will betray them later.Creepily performed characters Paul and Peter, feature a refreshing disparity from the original version. With Peter still reduced to a sidekick, Paul comes off more as apathetic and bored, compared to the original's architect being more enthusiastic and engrossed to the agonizing proceedings. Here lie two ideas: both personifications of evil are still eerily effective even if contrasting and also possibly mirror Haneke's own eagerness to the material while filming. Of course, the latter being a personal interpretation.Everything from the original is here: the excruciating long takes, the ingenious procedure of breaking the fourth wall, gruesome off-screen violence and the sense of hope and salvation thwarted by the revelation that the film is a self-conscious experiment. The only thing missing is the tension delivered by the unexpected from a Haneke film. And that's a big one.It is fair to feel betrayed by the film once you discover its cruel twist. A moment of satisfaction by the audience is heart-wrenchingly twisted to themselves; as the movie's effectiveness depends on the spectators' desire to acquire a Hollywood ending. Reviewing a remake of a vastly superior original film, it is hard to separate them and I much yearn for the years when this remake is deemed ridiculous. Haneke recycles his brilliant directing from the original and with that; it is even more curious why this one has to be made in the first place.",Funny Games

213,margielove,Read Below the Surface,9,1 November 2015,"It seems to me that the only reviewer who 'got' ""Funny Games"" was stephen7272 under the heading 'You Don't Understand What This Movie is About'.Yes it seems that many reviewers were not egg-static about the latest version with Naomi Watts and Tim Roth. I personally thought that both of the former gave excellent performances within the limits of the material they were given. I did see the German version - and recall that the later version was a shot -by -shot remake of the former.I believe that the latest version (as Stephen alluded to)was not about acting/scenery/length of shots etc. It was about not letting dangerous people thru the front door of your house in the first place.It was interesting to see the 'domestic dispute' between Roth and Watts - at the beginning - where Roth asserts that 'they are just 2 nice guys' because he hasn't been a party to the whole scenario - and it is interesting to understand how many people have been trapped - as in this case - AFTER people have been let in and it is too late then to do anything but be destroyed. In psychological terms your house is your body - and an aspect of the film is that ONCE these lowlifes were in the front door they had access to the owners' bodies - in order to destroy them.I thought that the device of 'speaking to the audience ' was effective in the sense that it drew the audience more into the film - increasing the terror by persuading them that they were part of the action.The rewinding device was also effective in that it demonstrated that we only get ONE chance at life - and have to value it and protect it at all costs - that device was about timing/chance and opportunity. Very unusual to see a child killed off in a movie in that way - which was also a device to persuade the audience once again that the results of 'letting people in' can be so dire,Margaret Reines.",Funny Games

Some of the forth-wall breaking was very well done, however it just wasn't done enough. The father's acting was good, and his pain was well simulated.As for the rest of the film...I thought the moments of drawn-out nothingness were, at times, effective.

Naomi Watts was wooden and pretty appalling, the dialogue had definitely seen better days, the supposed 'brutality' was surprisingly disappointing.I wasn't expecting much from what I thought was going to be a standard horror movie.

219,jkhuysmans0,When the Art of Dubbing Dies,8,24 July 2008,"""You shouldn't forget the importance of entertainment."" In fact so important, so narcissistic is entertainment that you go ahead a blow a few million just to remake your Austrian obscurity of hyper violence shot for shot in English because really, ""it's an American story."" I take this to be more of Wim Wenders or Werner Hertzog maneuver, assuming Haneke for a more streamlined and antiseptic intellectual than the others, but whatever... I don't know, the quality of Americanness to the narrative implies an oversight and an error on the director's part. That error in point is the apparently unrealized ""requirement"" the first time around that Haneke should have used inferior, maginally Hollywood, English language actors to capture the true essence of this so called American story as opposed to employing German speaking European actors of superior talent. Fact is, you shouldn't exactly believe all the hyperbole around this film, because the narrative is probably the least American in character than other films from this director. You're more likely to find Ralph Lauren style serial killers in Austria or on the shores of Lake Geneva (where the real money is at) than in Manhattan Beach, CA -especially these days, in this market, if you know where I'm headed with that statement (*see the American economy circa 1929*). Because US Americans rob banks before they return to their day jobs (at the bank) on Monday, and when they need drugs to ameliorate all the pain they feel, being an American, they stick their best friend for what turns out to be three dollars when it was potentially ten... right before they sell off their VCR to the local Pawn and Gun. This is where Haneke falls down: the point of violence is not simply pointless sport at all in the good ole' USA because violent tactics are usually associated with the art of getting money not with people who already have it. Or at least violence is one way of going about it, and, as it turns out, an increasingly common way of expanding and building personal wealth particularly those with much to build upon, much of nothing that is.Not to say, really, speaking of money, that American's don't enjoy cinematic projections of pointless violence as orchestrated and executed by European film directors adept at their craft as is Haneke. Indeed, there is a rich history of that scenario playing itself out in the history of entertainment theory; and lest we forget LA is the cinema's world stage. You wanna make world movies, take it to LA... That, as De Palma would have it, ""violence is inherently cinematic,"" is reason enough to put one's investment dollars behind the remake of a relatively obscure ultra violent film especially if it's being remade for the benefit of the USA and in the lingua franca. Lesson: film-making is almost exclusively and specifically about making money.So that's why... That's why they did it: For the money. Haneke's cinema violence is interesting, sure, it's lesson teaching, it's well directed, even philosophical but its violence doesn't cease to be violence. You can intellectualize it all you like; however, it remains that violence in film is a time-worn yet unmistakably proved commercial formula, while shunned and frowned upon in Europe and thriving always in the States, that plays off our lizard brain fears of the unknown sort of like Republican Politics. And, gee, by the way, I'll be darned, let me tell you, violent movies generate a lot of money, Batman. So every time you pop into the cinema with your gfriend, keep in mind, it's sort of like a Funny Game to separate you from what you're holding in you're pocket book. If a film was determined at some point that it couldn't do that, it wouldn't be film. And this includes ""Art films"" even, like Funny Games. (*Remember: Basically if you call a film an art film, it just means you were left behind. Avoid that.*)Over all the lack of departure form the original is what makes this film so post-postmodernly interesting. Funny Games EL Redeaux is better lit than the first film, and you can discern pretty clearly the advances in film stock since the mid-nineties; take a close look at that last 400 Blows style freeze frame shot at the end of each movie and compare the two - the new film is better. Apart from that, folks, very few differences exist between the films. It's my stance that the performances in the Austrian version are better because the actors in that picture are better actors but that's just my stance... You should see both, though, just for fun.",Funny Games

I have seen some real stinkers in my day, but the stench from this wreck permeated my nostrils with such rigor that I felt as though I was going to vomit. Apparently this was a commentary on violent film in America. Mr. Haneke, when your critique is more grotesque and depraved than anything on the silver-screen today, how are we supposed to take you seriously? I have never seen a film so misanthropic, so disgusting, and so ugly. It was obvious that the director sympathized with his sadistic antagonists while despising the tortured family. He treats this family with such disdain that I felt sorry for them as characters--what a bunch of sorry saps, held in the hand of one demonic writer. They were pathetic, for the sake of being pathetic. These characters were not created as persons but as objects. They were not only dehumanized by their torturers but by the writer himself.

221,Monellifilms,Amazing,10,15 December 2008,"The U.S. version of Funny Games is an amazing work of suspense, awkwardness, and storytelling. The most impressive aspect of this movie is how slowly and methodically it escalates. The two killers, Peter and Paul, are so subtle and awkward in their actions that you can't believe how the movie got to where it got. Haneke once again delivers a film devoid of movie clichés and creates his own new set of rules. Had this film been made by anyone else, Peter and Paul would have been more threatening early on. It was Haneke's direction that made this film work. Instead of having them immediately tie the family up and hold them hostage with a gun, they slowly and carefully build to it. Peter and Paul become more awkward and polite with every scene. We see just how easy this could all happen to anyone of us, and that is very terrifying. Haneke pokes fun at the audience several times during the film. First, when Peter and Paul are asked why they are holding the family hostage, they respond with the typical clichéd reasons from other movies killers (i.e. troubled youth, drug addicts, etc.). They rattle them all off, leaving the viewer just as confused. Haneke knows the truth, that it is much more interesting and terrifying when there is no reason or motive. Explaining why the two boys are doing this would take away from their impact on the audience. It makes us realize they can be anyone from anywhere.The most notable jab at the audience is when the character's break the fourth wall. After Peter is shot, which is the satisfying moment of the film for many viewers, Haneke has Paul rewind the film and fix the situation to their advantage.",Funny Games
222,rocketdive2001,There's something missing ...,2,20 April 2008,"I'll be real frank about this movie. When i first read about it, i felt that it would be something worth my time in the cinema, the idea of 2 polite terrorists holding a family hostage and psychologically teasing them sounds like one of those movies that will be remembered as a gem.It turns out, at least to me and my good friend who joined me for the movie, that it's a good idea but just not very well executed. I know, reading the forum and looking at everyone's view of the whole thing, you have to appreciate this with an ""out of the box"" view ... there will be a scene or two where one of the characters will talk to the audience for their thoughts ... and that infamous ""remote"" scene that people have debated as ""nonsense"".Point to make here is that i do appreciate the concept of the film, that was the draw for me to pay a good 10 bucks for it, but i just felt the execution of the story didn't quite live up to what it should have been. More dark humor, more ""funny games"", more fear injected into the family (sick as it sounds, but i think it will really make the victims more convincing) The opening part of the movie was decent, the story welcomes us to the family, the 2 polite strangers coming into the picture ... but once the family gets held hostage, it seems like the movie starts to become clumpsy. While other people in the cinema gripe about how stupid the movie is, i'm appreciating the overall idea and concept but just disappointed that it wasn't as good as it was made out to be.The actors weren't quite able to convince me of how serious they took their respective roles. I have caught a glimpse of the original version, the scene where the last game was play and i seem to find the original actors able to convince the audience and the victim involved how serious they were. Yet that same magic didn't quite show in the same scene in the English version. Quite a pity indeed.All in all, as bad as my rating is for this movie, i would say that it STILL watchable on a home release. Guess that's how some movies are ... the scare and fear factor can be better experienced in a homely environment ... just like poor George, Anne and Georgie sitting on the sofa ...Maybe i'll go catch the original and make up for this ""could-have-been-so-much-better"" experience!",Funny Games

225,hapiores,Funny Games in the Theater,8,27 July 2008,"Funny games has been around for quite a while now - since 1997 to be exact  and even though it had not reached the big audience it was quickly categorized as an underground cult movie. I had heard about it  excellent reviews  but did not know anything relevant about the story, apart from the comparison to A Clock Work Orange.Funny games shows how to psychopaths jump from house to house, from family to family, to torture people with their childish and purposeless games. In this case we have the opportunity to watch the entire process as they lurk inside Ann and George's ( Naomi Watts and Tim Roth) house. The next 90 minutes or so are of pure torture, as we watch the family sinking in the games, unable to escape, sometimes looking simply paralyzed, bearing the torture crying, wishing it would all go away. But it doesn't.The first reaction after-wards was of simple disappointment, everybody dies, and although you might be on the victim's side there's no way they could win. This is probably what makes Funny Games a highly provocative  and meaningful  movie: your're warned about everything thats going to happen, and the clues are obvious. Lets see: in the beginning, as the title appears, classical score changes to heavy punk, transforming the faces of the characters from a happy family to a silly family, laughing and smiling in the background; Paul (Michael Pitt) faces to the audience  in a move that would seem fine in a more easy going/cool context, breaking the barrier between audience and movie  asking you which side you're on, and that it doesn't really make any difference; after seeing Peter (Brady Corbet) getting shot by Naomi Watts Michael Pitt looks for the TV remote and rewinds the story - his story, after all - preventing his friend from dying; in the end, after throwing Naomi watts of board the two psychopaths have the only conversation with purpose, talking about reality and fiction, and how both concepts are relative.It should be obvious, from the first moment, that we are being tricked. The funny games are not necessarily what happens on the screen but what happens between the audience and the movie, as the story twists and escapes from what we want, confusing the viewer by mixing heavy moments with parody, nonsense, and sadistic humor. And we, just like the characters, embark in this story, striving to believe until the very end, ignoring the warnings that flash: it's fiction, nothing else.",Funny Games
226,Diplodocus55,"Less evocative than the original, but an interesting cinematic experiment...",7,16 March 2008,"The idea of Haneke remaking FUNNY GAMES for American audiences appealed me from the beginning. I was deliciously disturbed by the original, which was quite thought-provoking as it entertained. I also found the idea of a director remaking his own movie (in a different language, no less) interesting. Cecil B. DeMille directed the THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in 1923 (a silent picture in black and white), then again in 1956 (in color, with sound). Hitchcock did THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH twice. Sam Raimi re-explores the events of THE EVIL DEAD in the beginning of EVIL DEAD 2, but in a different tone. FUNNY GAMES 2007 is basically a shot-for-shot/word-for-word remake of the original, so I think it was natural for me to be less affected by it. I found the sequences which were so gut-wrenching in the original be quite underwhelming here. The new villain actors were adequate for the roles, but IMO far less effective than the duo in the original. The villains in both movies are easy to hate, but in the original there was a complex charm to them -- they were not only funnier and scarier, but more believable. I've considered that the original being in a foreign language might have added a nuance in their performances that wouldn't be there for people who understood the language. The ""Ciao belle"" moment in the original was one of the most devastating things I'd seen in all my years of watching movies, but I felt quite emotionally distanced during that moment in the new version. I wonder how effective that part would have been had I never seen the original. This brings to mind Gus Van Sant's PSYCHO (another virtual shot-for-shot remake) -- would it have been remotely suspenseful if no one knew of Hitchcock's original? It's hard to determine if my lack of engagement with this film is due to me already knowing the story and what to expect, or if it because of differences in the film-making. Haneke duplicates the same set-ups, angles and lighting schemes -- and sometimes it felt like he was just going through the motions. Maybe the idea of the remake appealed to him, but once he started filming he felt a bit bored by it. At the very least, I appreciate that this new version was made and I hope those who watch it are affected by it like I was the original.",Funny Games

234,sheshetta,Funny Games 2008,10,25 January 2009,"SPOILER ALERT! So, you think it is pointless that writer/director Michael Haneke remade his 1997 German film ""Funny Games"" into the 2008 American release? Did you ever consider that there are people out there who did not see the 1997 version? Well, guess what? I never saw it, and I am an avid film aficionado. Seeing the description of the film, I might not have watched it. When I saw the cast, specifically Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, and Michael Pitt, I knew I had to watch it. These are actors who are imminently watchable, and it is not the first venture into the horror genre for any of them. However, ""Funny Games"" is unlike any other horror film I have ever seen. It is a scathing indictment of how Americans have become nonchalant voyeurs of violence. The direction may be shot for shot like the original, but conceptually it is unique and scary. My heart was beating fast with fear, in many places, as I wondered what was going to happen next. The violence is almost never shown on film. It is almost always shown off screen or in the aftermath. So, we are not voyeurs to the violence in this movie. This only serves to heighten our fear. The acting was as brilliant as I expected it be from this superior cast. Not having seen the original, I found Michael Pitt talking into the camera to be quite amusing; not that it has never been done before, but it was done with alacrity. I thought the use of the remote control to rewind a crucial scene and change the ending of the scene to be an amazing twist; again, not having seen the original. The end of the movie, which I will not reveal, chilled me to the bone. There have been other remakes. Gus Van Sant's brightly colored, shot for shot remake of ""Psycho"" was unnecessary and boring. It added nothing to the movie. The remake of the French/Dutch film ""The Vanishing"", which was not shot for shot, was made by the original director with the same aim to bring it to an American audience. However, it was a poor imitation of the original, and was given a sappy ""Hollywood Happy Ending"". I am glad that Michael Haneke was allowed to make an American remake of ""Funny Games"" that is true to the original, for those of us who did not see the original. I, for one, will watch it again.",Funny Games
235,donflush,avoid this at all cost,1,8 February 2011,"Like others, I got suckered into renting this movie after seeing the trailer. They made it look like ""cape fear"" or something. How wrong was I. I didn't know there was a German version by the same director, neither. I can't relate to that decision. Why not just add subtitles, instead of wasting money and everybody's time? This movie was so pretentious and weak, despite the signature super-ventilated performance by Naomi Watts. And I don't know how Tim Roth could put up with playing a role that only had 10 lines and was in a chair during a big chunk of the movie. And that kid, OMG, I swear that was the dumbest kid ever occupied that much screen time. Basically, the movie was about a dumb family going on vacation and made dumb decisions dealing with two house invaders. It purposely depraved the audience from getting satisfaction left and right. But what's the point? If they didn't want to entertain you, then either a)don't make a movie or b) make it, but give it out for free. They're in it for art, right? But since when the word ""art"" has become the opposite of ""money""? To me, a great piece of art entertains effortlessly, but not in a vulgar way. Not only this movie doesn't entertain, but it's also vulgar. How can you show the husband asking the wife to take of her clothes in front of the house invaders, and not providing the satisfaction of revenge later on? So what, you're condoning violence? Well how about showing the human spirit of justice? This movie was not art house, no way, it was just BS.",Funny Games
236,Jogilius,Does a man need a hit in the face to learn that it's not good for him? I don't think so.,3,17 July 2008,"Do I need a sadistic movie to tell me that there's something questionable in movie violence? Should you get whipped to learn that it's bad for you? In general, I see different kinds of movies as having three different values: entertainment, experience and education. Most movies (especially Hollywood-originated ones) have very little value in the educational aspect, but in general all movies have individual emphases on these three. On top of them comes the value of rewatchability which is tied to all of the three and different more accurate aspects of the movie such as plot. As for Funny games the uncomfort and even torment of watching the movie makes the movie's value very low in the entertainment department - at least for me and probably so for a majority of potential viewers. As for the educational value I don't see how a thoroughly fictional ride of sadism with no clear motives could educate anyone in a positive way. Experiencing such violence on screen makes you think about it more, and it probably also lowers the threshold of a viewer to commit real acts of violence. If one would want to moralize (which on the other hand probably isn't a proper reason for evaluating an adult movie) the educational value could be thus considered even negative.So what's left from the values is mostly the experience side of the movie, the thrill ride in this case. The extremely long single shot scenes certainly make it effective in many scenes as does the almost yet not exactly realistic touch in portraying the feelings and actions of the protagonists. They make the movie memorable yet at the same time even less entertaining. Still, it can be regarded as a merit for the movie as not all of the movies aim at being entertaining. But the absurd scenes that communicate with the viewer make it awkwardly obvious that you are just watching a generic piece of horror. This takes a big part of the effectiveness away. Another shortage is the apparent lack of motivation for the antagonists.Some may claim that the absurdities and the lack of point are just a brilliant way of depicting how perverted the entertainment industry is in its all glamorized violence. But does a person really need a slap in the face to see that it's not fun? I don't think so. I would only recommend this to people that are fascinated by sadism in all its forms.",Funny Games
237,Apologetickid,Uh...what?,3,16 March 2008,"I don't really know what to say. I heard that this movie was supposed to be about middle class America's blood lust, but I feel like that message was lost in translation. In fact, I wouldn't have gathered that if I hadn't heard Naomi Watts talking about it on Jay Leno. Without that information, this film is an incoherent, painfully dry, underdeveloped ""indie"" film. The characters seem to have little or no motivation. The motivation for the kids who are doing the killing is never explained, the parents seem suspiciously undisturbed when their son gets killed, and a number of pivotal explanations are missing (such as where the boys came from, why they did what they did, etc.) Also, there is that weird scene with the remote where Paul rewinds time. He rewinds time! Umm...what? Suddenly the films ""Ransom"" and ""Click"" collide in a painfully inexplicable turn of events. Also, Paul periodically speaks to the camera for no apparent reason.I say ""no apparent reason"" because there is a reason, it just isn't made apparent. The reason is to remind the audience that they are participating in the gore by merely viewing it. But that is never made clear, and it comes of as just seeming weird and out of place.Is this movie disturbing? Yep. Will it cause you to feel uncomfortable and squirm in your seat? Yeah, probably. But it's not good. In fact, it's so not good that I am currently at home watching ""The Rock"" with Nicholas Cage in an effort to forget what I just saw. Let me restate that: I am watching ""The Rock""! When you have to watch a film like ""The Rock"" in order to purify yourself from what you've just seen, well...it probably wasn't very good.",Funny Games

The suspension of disbelief was blown off early, and after that it all was unrealistic, boring, slow and uninteresting.

Two young men knock on their door, and that's when the trouble starts. Soon, these men take the helpless family hostage, forcing them to play sadistic games in order to survive the night.I think this deserves an 8, because of the plot structure and acting. Although the story is a good one, it is somewhat clichéd. The 'why are you doing this?' phrase is overused, but leans towards a chilling lack of any motive for the terror the two men cause.

This becomes clear when one of serial killers looks and talks to the viewer. The idea is good, but for to have been misunderstood by most, I think it became more a dull suspense and obvious. There isn't an expectation about the survival of the family, much less twisted. The bad guys end up being more interesting than anything else in the film. And some people end up liking them more than of the victims themselves. I've heard several reasons for the existence of the scene with the remote control, but honestly, I don't found one that was actually convenient and perhaps express the idea of ​​the director. In short: still don't understand that! Out the various slow scenes, the miss of a really tense script and the various chances to save the family that were ignored, it's cool the way it was shown two guys bored and pampered doing their ""games"" in bad taste.

Before I continue- let me point out that I am not easily scared, especially with films- and also, I was well into my 20's when I watched it for the first time. By the time it was over, I had turned on every light in the house, walked outside to regain composure, and ultimately ended up at my sisters house because I was so unnerved by this movie I couldn't be alone anymore.2 sadistic 20 somethings torment a family of 3 in their lake house. The dead look in Pitts eyes and the complete lack of emotion from both of them makes this one of the best horror movies ever. Now, is it scary? Mmmm... Kinda. But it's not the ""scary"" that scares you in this one. It's the horrendous feeling of hopelessness and isolation that makes it scary. This isn't a ""slasher"" film. It isn't a ""paranormal"" ghost film- no. It's something that can, and most likely has happened in real life. When you watch the true crime stuff on A&E (I survived, for example) this is a story that could very well end up on an episode. Idk how to explain it. Just watch it.

The director and writer have to deliver that answer with their work.This one - like too many others - just is a mockery and makes fun of the audience for following the movie at all.

The bet could have been cut short if they had just shot them right away instead of playing sadistic games for 2 hours.The actors are okay, Naomi Watts is her usual believable self.

However after reading about the director's vision of trying to show the audience how sickening the watching of graphic torture for entertainment really is, I knew I had to see it.Unlike the hypocritical Untraceable or The Condemned, this film does exactly what it intends to do. This film gets in your head by giving the pretense that you will witness all the horrible acts, and then turns around on you by not showing anything! Everything is off-screen so you are left with only the sound effects. It is more disturbing as your imagination sets to work on the images off screen, and that in itself is more horrifying.Haneke crafts a superbly smart psychological thrill, but almost too intelligent as it almost falters on expecting you to know the philosophy behind the film-making and for someone knowing nothing about the film it might be confusing or frustrating.I would not recommend this film to everyone as it will disappoint the Saw/Hostel audience and may confuse newcomers.

253,todieforx,a bit of narcissism,6,28 June 2008,"By the time I finished watching this film,I could confidently say that for more than half of the screen time I had been awake -thanks to the previous awareness about the original intention of the director.And this,proves a big defection of the film.Judging from the reception of the audiences,I must say, the original intention of the director failed to be delivered effectively,the result of which is that American audiences won't realize(accept?) fully that it's a critique of their typical horror genre while the audiences from other cultures will, at best, consider it a pointless avant-garde film.Nevertheless,the social critiques in this film can surely be spotted.Constructed thoroughly on an 'anti-climax'idea,this film delivers its ironic messages about Hollywood typical horror movies by deliberately goes against audiences' expectations(for a horror movie):while all the gore scenes happen off-screen,all the victims are denied of the chances to survive(note that there isn't a 'last-girl'in most Hollywood horror movies). Of course this film also plays with some 'essential' horror-genre motifs,such as the psychotics killing out of no reason;the helpless victims losing connection with neighbors/police etc.However,there's the 'rewind'sequence that seems absurd that reveals director's sarcastic intentions -the psychotics are not supposed to die,well,at least die so early.I also noted some interesting things.Again it touches on the issue of poor,miserable people coming from dysfunctional families take revenges on society by torturing the well-off middle class.I wonder is it a common themes in Hollywood horror/crime movies. If so,then it's another parody(or pastiche).Furthermore,in a more implicit way,the psychotic pair are quite possibly gays -isn't it one more proof that it's the marginal people's revenge on the society dismissing them? All in all,I have to say that there's a bit of narcissism in this film -the director wants to criticize something by using self-parody,thinking it will work but ends up making an awkward pastiche.It somehow reminds me of Bigas Luna's Jamon,jamon.I couldn't really say I like this film,but I appreciate Heneke's effort -although it seems half in vain.",Funny Games
254,craysellers,You Really Don't Want to See This Movie,2,12 April 2019,"Reviews give opinions, and those who read them decide if it sounds like they'd agree, or they ignore it and watch (or don't watch) the movie, regardless. But my opinion is that this movie isn't even fair. Judgements like good or bad don't apply. The acting is fine, it's cinematography is actually good. Tasteless? Pink Flamingos is tasteless, but at least it's true to its story. Funny Games is like Psycho where Norman Bates never really existed and Janet Leigh's experience is nullified and Hitchcock leaves in the shower scene as a blooper. I'm avoiding a major spoiler, so understand: it's important for a movie to have some rules of logic to qualify for good or bad status. When your narrative is so corrupt that basic rules of logic don't apply, how can nonsense be worthwhile? There's a movie called The Hitcher where the bad guy pops up in the strangest places: at one point he leaves a victim's finger in his prey's French fries. But even supernatural powers would have made it impossible for him to do that (barring the supernatural power to do something at the same time you aren't doing it).
Some movies show an intense personal struggle that fails. Something about the futility in the failure offers some insight whether it's Frances (Frances Farmer bio) or Cool Hand Luke. Why try so hard when satisfactory results are out of the question? But you understand, and appreciate those fighting lost causes. But when they win?

256,Aurdreyen,"Funny Games has to be the most depressing, realistic and brilliant movie of all remakes.",10,1 January 2012,"I've alway hated remakes, always thought ""Why can't Hollywood directors leave good foreign films alone, stop trying to claim all the credit?"" I have recently said that about Hollywood remaking Old Boy, but Funny Games is much different. It isn't made by some money making director sitting up on a throne in Hollywood, it's made by the same director as the original director of Funny Games(1997) and so I though ""I'll give it a try"". I liked the original Funny Games and I heard that it is going to be a shot for shot remake, so I was willing to give a remake a try. And boy was it brilliant. I rate my movies in 4 categories; Cinematography, Film-making, Acting and the Overall Experience. Cinematography: The visuals in this Film are amazing. At the very beginning, the visuals are nice and bright and happy, to bring out the emotions of the Family. They're on holiday, going to their flash vacation home in the woods, everything is fine. But then as things start to go wrong, the picture gets dark and eerie. This is how to bring out raw emotions of the character. 25/25Film-making: With remakes, usually actors try to make it their own by changing the settings, maybe adding things to the plot. I'm just glad that Haneke did this a shot for shot remake, so it's exactly the same as the original in camera angles, editing, camera timing. This is how a remake should be. 25/25Acting: I have always liked Naomi Watts, she was great in Films like The Ring and King Kong, and Tim Roth was amazing in films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, so his choice of them was perfect. Michael Pitt and his ally as the 2 psychopathic men are also a brilliant choice. They seem normal yet disturbed at the very same time. This is amazing acting, and in one scene where Anne(Naomi Watts) vomits I'm almost certain she really vomited. That is how good the acting is. 25/25Overall Experience: I enjoyed this film very much, it kept me entertained throughout the whole film by keeping you guessing whether the Family would beat Peter and Paul, or will they beat them. This is truly amazing, and do not listen to any of those darn Metacritic critics saying ""Oh its a remake, remakes are never good.""

This sparks the leader of these captors, we call him annoying fagboy, to say that line, and thus, rewinds the movie and stops her from getting the remote. Biggest ""wtf"" moment in a movie ever. I didn't get it. Thirdly and finally, the camera angles bored me immensely. Sorry but watching long shots of 2 to 5 straight minutes of the same angle where-as half the time nothing is going on, no point. This movie could have been 45 minutes long, but instead it drags on.

260,chackers,Glaring oversight,8,15 May 2009,"!!!SPOILER AHEAD!!! What I thought was unrealistic was that both parents didn't go nuts on those kids, as soon as the father got hit with the golf club, and ESPECIALLY after the kids indicated that the entire family would be dead by morning. Pain or not, when you realize your child's in danger, you react with extreme prejudice; your anger would certainly numb you temporarily, while you provided for your kid's safety. Otherwise, very good acting, especially from Devon Gearhart (""Georgie"") and Michael Pitt (""Paul""). In fact, I was wondering if it was good for a kid Devon's age to even ACT in scenes this intense, some of which looked genuinely greuling.",Funny Games
261,pranobg00,Family Shock,7,9 November 2008,"If I were to sum up Funny Games in two words it would be unmitigatedly negative. Terrifying in its casual malice, the sequence of events shocks beyond the expectations of a rational audience. In some odd way this movie reminded me of Apocalypto  whatever can go wrong does  except that Apocalypto ends on a redemptive note while this movie simply leaves you staring and the credits and wondering what just happened. A blend of gorno (Saw, Hostel etc) and the traditional horror movie elements of isolation will leave you gasping at the end. If you know how this movie ends, you probably would not want to watch it. Naomi Watts anchors a difficult role, while Brady Corbet (Peter) and Michael Pitt (Paul) are creepy. Definitely not one for casual family viewing.",Funny Games
262,rising-down,I don't know,5,21 August 2011,"I'll give this a mild rating for being unconventional and its surprisingly good ideas from time to times, however for some people it could really be a pain in the a* to watch. I watched the film to a certain point when I thought »wow, that's the end — and it's not that bad!«. Time seemed to have flied by, no big flaws and I was ready for the final scene and the credits to roll in. So I watched Naomi Watts basically doing nothing, but doing it for a very long time and nothing happened. Nothing. I really dig long shots with no dialog, as long as they make sense and deliver to the atmosphere – but what followed was one long shot after the other with about zero plot development, as mentioned in other reviews here. Completely out of pace. I think it meant to give the viewer a deep depressing impression or something like that, but I have to admit, it really bored me and made me uncomfortable watching — I'm not talking about that uncomfortable feeling when you watch movies like Man bites Dog, because it's hard stuff, no, it's just lame. The camera play is as boring as it can be and you get the imagination, that the camera crew told Naomi Watts to »do her thing« for about 5 minutes or so, while the crew takes a coffee break. So, as to cinematography this movie is one of the worst I've seen in the recent years. But I also need to note, that the story itself is fairly good, and the actors did a good job. Just half an hour after watching the movie I already can't remember, whether the movie had a music score or not except for the shitty theme song by Naked City. Even more disturbing to me was, that I somehow knew the music and after looking it up, I remembered, that I actually listened to this crap a couple of years ago... by choice. So I think this movie is not bad, it's not great but it's far from being a classic or art(house). It's *meh*.",Funny Games
263,FletchGives,Amazing,10,14 December 2012,"Watching ""Funny Games"" is a bit like coming across a major accident on the highway - you know you should continue driving on past the scene, but you just can't keep yourself from slowing down and gawking at all the wreckage.The premise of the story does not sound very promising at first, as the idea, or a simple variation of it, has served as the foundation for countless such films in the past: an innocent family of three is held hostage in their home by a couple of sadistic killers who systematically abuse and terrorize their victims for their own twisted pleasure.So many horror movies are predictable and formulaic that it's a pleasant surprise to come across one that actually makes an effort to break free of its bonds and make its own way in the world. And, indeed, ""Funny Games"" busts through the horror movie conventions with an almost ruthless determination. In this Americanized version of a film he made in his native Austria in 1997, director Michael Haneke scrupulously avoids obvious camera setups and editing techniques, bypassing virtually every storytelling, visual or audio cliché endemic to the genre. There is no background music, for instance, to cue us into the scary moments, no screeching cats jumping out of the shadows, and no point-of-view shots designed to generate easy suspense. Unlike in most films of this type, the violence here happens in an entirely haphazard and random manner, making it all the more frightening in its unpredictability and plausibility. Haneke refuses to cater to the expectations of his audience, making them face the reality of the nightmare he's showing them rather than giving them what it is they may want to see.Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet are cringe-worthy and terminally creepy as the smarmy psychopaths who get their jollies out of watching other people suffer, while Naomi Watts, Tim Roth and Devon Gearhart engage our full sympathy as the hapless victims who have come up against the blank wall of two twisted minds they are woefully unequipped to even understand, let alone wage battle against.This is one of the most memorable and artful horror films of recent times, but it is also one of the most unnerving and difficult to watch. The movie gets into your bones, no matter how much your better angels may be telling you to keep it out. It's depressing and disturbing and is certainly not intended for all audiences, but it is a movie that it is very difficult to shake off once you've given yourself over to it.",Funny Games

I often don't write ratings because I wouldn't consider myself an expert on movies and often realize that a movie I don't like, others may find appealing. I saw this originally at the Sundance Film Festival and if I hadn't been in the middle of a long row, I would have definitely walked out. I've never seen such shocking violence combined with such bad acting. The two boys who play the bad characters aren't just bad at acting, I found them incredibly annoying to have to watch.

266,mrblimp,Good film - Liked original better,8,3 February 2009,"This film is played straight with two distinct exceptions. At one point one of the killers looks into the lens and talks to the audience questioning the viewers as to whose side they are on and then admitting that recognizably they must be on the side of the family, as if to either suck the viewer further into the story, attempting to make them a part of the killers' actions or as a warning that to be on the side of the family is to be on the losing side. It seems that this one point, at this one moment in the film, the film maker wants the viewer to know the ending, and is betting that even knowing so they will watch the film to its ultimate, now pre-disclosed, ending.As to MuzikJunky and steandric's synopsis' I don't know where they got all that psychobabble about this film being "". . . a deconstruction in the way violence is portrayed in the media"" or an "" . . . exploration of our violent society and how depictions of violence reflect and shape our culture"". Sounds like they both read the same promo notes. They did get it right with their spoilers as it is about a middle-class family who submits both physically and mentally to torture, violence, and eventually death foisted upon them by two young white-gloved visitors while they are starting their vacation at their lake house vacation retreat, which happens to be the next stop (house, having just performed the same experience at the neighbors) for the pair of young, serial killers on an excursion through the lakeside neighborhood. Here's what both versions of this film are: A clear indication of the adverse effect of following the ""state of submission"" constantly proscribed to the general citizenry by politicians and their ilk. Here's what I thought while watching both of these movies, had the family: 1.) understood the power of self protection they would have found a way to get a kitchen knife and attack the two killers. 2.) owned a firearm this couple would have been able to defend themselves after they were left alone in the house.Had the father internalized his pain he could have attacked the one killer while the other was outside with his wife and possibly saved his family. Even without a firearm, had the family understood the power of self protection the wife wouldn't have run off alone for help, they would have armed themselves and fortified their position, instead of one of them running off in the night looking for help. Unfortunately, as the remote control reenactment proves when the wife finally does exert a sense of self protection shooting one of the killers, the film makers never intended to portray the state of ""self protection"" and were only interested in portraying the ""state of submission"". This scene also holds the one exception to the showing of on screen violence. We actually see the killer's chest explode with blood and gore when the wife shoots him with the gun. And we get to see it twice, the second in reverse replay, as if the filmmaker was saying, yes, I broke my rule, just as I earlier broke the rule of allowing the actors to speak to the audience, but, by providing the killer with the ability to use a remote I not only wiped away what I showed, insofar as to negating the visual but, just as I allowed the actor to cross the line of reality/non-reality that is film, I am making sure that the audience now realizes that this is indeed just a film and nothing more. A final spoiler  the almost sounding philosophical discussion between the two killers while sailing the family's boat to their next victims in which It appears the filmmaker was attempting to define film, or at least this film, led me to think of the psychobabble in MuzikJunky and steandric's synopsis'. The reality was they were talking about a science fiction story that in some way could almost be considered an ever so slight synopsis of the film's plot.But all of this leaves the viewer with a problem understanding what the filmmaker is trying to say. Why make this film? Why allow the two incidents (the actor talking to the audience and the replay of the killers death to eliminate that it occurred) of film rule to be broken? The killers never appear to have enjoyed what they are doing. Could the fact that their Funny Games do not seem to amuse nor bring them joy or fulfillment be a mirror of the experience of viewing a film that film audiences have been living with since the invention of movies first occurred: One watches, and is left wanting more, feeling unfulfilled, not knowing what will really happen next. And for those of us who are true film addicts: wanting to see yet another movie, even if it is about a completely unrelated story.",Funny Games

Another bad part was the endless rambling of these bored pretentious boys, and what is up with the reversing the plot when Ann finally gets the upper hand.

268,xym07,"One-time shocker, but enough to check.",7,12 July 2008,"Enough words are said; some people loved it, and others hated it. It's is basically a motion picture resume about violence in genre thrillers and our attitude about it. It should've been a good topic in a decade ago, but in the new millennium too much debate has progressed already, making this old dog a bit rusty to swallow. If you haven't seen it, then give it a try. If you are a fan of art-house films then it would make you a good 100-minute chill.The American remake of Funny Games is almost the same film as the 1997 original except a cinematography by Darius Khondji and American actors, which sometimes becomes too melodramatic. The visual, besides, is what really shines through. It is not spectacular like his usuals, but it is a really pretty upgrade from the grainy original. If you're a first-timer, then this one is your pick thanks to that.* P.S : This film is not released in South Korea yet, and I just saw it in a Spanish theater in the middle of a trip.",Funny Games
269,hunter_h-19354,"Dark and disturbing, but drawn out.",5,6 July 2019,"I decided to check this film out after reading some of the positive/mixed reviews. I was expecting it to be better than I thought it was, but it about lined up with the rest of the reviews on this movie.First And foremost the acting was good, but nothing spectacular. The family was very on dimensional, didn't know too much information about them, and when they're getting tortured (specifically the parents) they pretty much just sit there the entire film and have little to no strategy to get out of thier predicament. They make little evasive moves here and there but each time it's 1 step forward and two steps back. However the two psychopaths in this film acting wise were absolutely excellent. You genuinely get a very creepy unsettling vibe from them as the movie progresses, and that's what really kept me watching.The problem with the movie is that it's just rather boring in certain parts, and there's scenes that are dragged on for an unnecessary amount of time. When the woman was trying to cut herself free from the tape in the living room that scene itself was about 10 minutes long. That's why I knocked some stars off because I wasn't thoroughly engaged the entire film.Overall the movie isn't BAD. It's certainly not the best film I've seen nor the worst. It's definitely gut wrenching watching what these two maniacs do to a family, so be prepared for some hard to watch scenes. The ending was very well done and sends shivers up your spine.

However, after a promising opening, the film gradually sapped my interest through protracted shots and scenes of negligible relevance. The film is classified as a horror/thriller. I would probably change this to a 'labored sicko drama'. Unfortunately, this category does not exist. Though the acting overall is captivating, and the film is moderately watchable, when the credits finally arrived (about 30 minutes late for my liking), I hurried out of the theater shaking my head at the conclusion.

Rules of fear change, an horrific situation is not introduced suddenly, but its gradually presented passing from a long series of feelings that exponentially are increasing without immediately reaching the physical brutality: courtesy, embarrassment, irritation, hostility, contrast, pain, fear, terror, horror slowly follow each other holding in tension who is watching.

I chose 1 for awful but given the choice I would have chosen -10 for borderline unwatchable. Films are shot and edited in a certain way because the standard methods are tried and true and viewers expect to see certain things at certain times to advance the story. The director has tried to be too original here and it has failed miserably. Completely unbelievable and at the same time annoying to watch. And what is with the scene at the end with the remote control and the talking to camera? Stupid and annoying again. As for the story it had too many holes in it and the antagonists where cast wrong.

The length of the film is excessive. In the end you care about no one involved and you are left feeling the conclusion (though there really is none) is totally unsatisfactory.The violence contained in the film is never shown though the effects of the violence and its remnants are displayed prominently.My belief is that the director was trying to show how passé we now find violence and even goes an extra step to show bare sexuality (there is no nudity in the movie) against the back drop of the violence to allow the audience to judge their own ""arousal factors"" and how close they are to violence.But no matter what the directors intention, the product was without merit. I would recommend not watching the film. Not even when suffering from extreme sleeplessness in hopes that this might lull you into a restful slumber - trust me it won't.Tim Roth is wasted with very little dialog. Naomi Watts is wasted though she is able to show a great deal of emotion and is used for her looks as an arousal tool.

275,WormEyedZombie,Nothing funny about it.,8,4 September 2008,"Wow.This film strongly reminded me of the cult classic TV series ""Tales from the crypt"".It did it not because of the presence of any monsters or supernatural elements whatsoever, but because of one very special key appeal: In that show, bad guys could win.Yes, ""Funny games"" is -as somebody already said- a story of the triumph of evil. Not an over the top cartoonish ""Conquer the world"" evil, but one much more simple, pure, credible and -for the same reason- terrifying: The psychopathic impulse for making people suffer... Just for the thrill of it. Just to have a good time.Just because it's FUN.You see, that's the real evil. The one that's pure and simple. The one without justification, cause or practical purpose. The one that just IS and that's all. The natural born evil.In the movie, this evil is incarnated in the young figures of Paul and Peter; two very polite and apparently harmless boys who one day decide to pick a small family and make them have the living nightmare of their lives. They scare, menace, hurt and torture a shocked father, mother and son; betting that they all will be dead by next day's morning.The acting is in one word: Superb. The whole cast is perfect (yes, even the little kid). Watts, Roth and Corbet do an amazing job, but the one that really steals the show is a fantastic Michael Pitt who absolutely shines in the twisted-maniacal-son-of-a-b*tch of a role he was born to play. I mean, that guy is scary. The moments when he speaks to the audience are priceless.Some reviewers had said that the movie is slow and boring. I don't think so. OK, it's not precisely fast-paced; but for this kind of story and this particular atmosphere, I think the rhythm is pretty good. Besides the suspense is incredible, and you really get to feel angst for that poor family whose fate seems inevitable.Downers? Well, I guess the plot can be way too simple for viewers who are used to twist-ending crime drama flicks like Seven or The bone collector. If you are one of those, better stay away from this one. If you are not, or even if you are but decide to keep an open mind and give this fine flick a chance, well, let's just remember what Adaptation's Charlie Kaufman used to say about real life: Real life is not about car chases, gunfights, romances or epiphanies...

Now are you ready for the flaws that really made me mad and disappointed while I was watching:1) The two parts where Paul looks at the camera and talks to the audience, I mean was that really necessary?! 2) The rewind Paul has when Ann shoots Peter. Are you joking? That was one of the most ridiculous scene's I have ever seen in any movie. 3) When they killed the little boy, Georgie, the parents didn't have any reaction. If it was my son that died I would be like ""F*ck that! My boy is dead!"". They showed almost no emotion in that specific scene. 4) Even though they busted the husband's knee, I'm sure if that was really happening in the real world, someone would actually attempted to do something of what was going on.

Everything goes well and ordinary for them until a teenage boy comes to ask for some eggs for the neighbor...Funny Games U.S. offers an interesting experience that requires some attention and thought. Time from time its some excessively long and (completely)passive scenes can really push the limits of the audience's patience, but after all they have some purpose. The constant tension and weeping in the movie also becomes very disturbing as the minutes pass; however, I can guarantee that you will not forget the taste of that tension for a long time.(It has been two and a half years since I had seen the movie the first time- never forgot the way it made me feel.) The direct speeches to the camera are especially remarkable. Brady Corbet and Michael Pitt, who play the teenager psychopaths, show very convincing performances, as well as Naomi Watts and Tim Roth(who had to display quite complicated emotions without over-dramatizing them.)---This section may contain slight spoilers---This movie basically asks two questions: - How can you distinct reality from non-reality? - And does it really matter if something is true or not?The scene with the remote control was very interesting; the movie was throwing up something that was very sudden and unexpected, awakening the audience from a stupor of desperation, but then when he takes everything back and sets it up the way it would be in a horror movie, he almost mocks the known expectations of the audience. Another remarkable thing is how two irrelevant things are constantly being combined in the movie, and this begins with the opening where the classical music suddenly switches to death-metal that does not match the scene. Then it continues throughout the motion picture with the excessively polite speeches of the psychos; it is also interesting that they wear white clothes as though to cover their identity. The scene in which they tell different names for themselves and Paul invents different life stories for Peter, they once again mock the unnecessary stamps of society(which we can't know are a part of the reality for sure.)In the end, one just thinks, ""even if they had a reason to act like that, would that change the facts or the result?Does it really matter how you SEEM when we don't know what you ARE?""",Funny Games

Can (mainstream) viewers handle 2 hours of what they know can happen-and it happens to others? Mr Haneke seems to love observing family member characters dealing with extreme situations. On one hand we have a typical family which one could call civilized, and on the other hand two young violent sadists. The two worlds are opposed to each other, but then in reality they meet everyday in every part of the world. Their difference is the difference of classical music and black metal (both musical styles can be listened in this movie)...But yet, what is the difference of a normal humorous pretty bomber pilot with Paul and Fatty? They both guarantee a fatal sadistic without hope end. Maybe some people have these realities inside them too. Yet Mr Haneke did not present the beauty of violence as Hollywood movies would (mainstream or Tarantino), nor he directed an hymn to violence as it is clearly seen in ""Clockwork orange"". The ""normal"" watcher sympathizes the normal family. On the contrary in real life situation, maybe reading through a newspaper or watching TV, he would feel sympathy for them for 5 minutes. The power of ""evil"" is presented unquestionable. No hope can survive, even time rewinds and cannot beat the violent (re)actions of these young monsters. The personalities of Paul and Fatty are very interesting as in the end they express some questionable pseydophilosophies. What's their difference again with Nazis and current aggressive wars? Maybe this is a reference to Chaplin's ""Monsieur Verdoux""... The movie can also be seen through the ""shocking effect"" theory. We question the strength of the family especially father’s protectiveness, but we miss the point that in reality people with normal lifes become easily victims, one can say they are conformists. The shock is less intense for a person who lives an abnormal life and is ready to protest against violence... One must be ready for a ""disturbing"" movie no happy end, no cheap Hollywood violin music, no Deus ex machina, but as it was written above this is an every day incident...We cannot expect from people who are hypnotized all their lifes by ""happy endings and superheroes"" to credit this movie.",Funny Games
285,allenap,Brilliant depiction of bullying and victimisation,9,11 April 2008,"Haneke has risked the inevitable (and necessary) accusations of hypocrisy with this remake.For all the postmodernism, this film is an excellent depiction of general bullying tactics taken to an extreme. Peter and Paul set up the family's torment in such a way that they can blame their victims (even if it is in a spurious way). The father is goaded into slapping them; the son is intimidated into pulling the trigger.The extended shots of the parents trying to recover and escape before their tormentors return are somewhat boring, but they serve the valuable purpose of refusal to glamorise the violence-we see the fallout in real time (or almost real time anyway). As well, by boring the viewer, Haneke tempts the audience to wish for Peter and Paul's return, which only furthers his point.And perhaps the point we can take from this film is not that Americans consume too much on screen violence (which is xenophobic anyway), but rather that on screen violence reflects an internal (perhaps innate?) sadism within us all.",Funny Games

This seems like an attempt from a film student giving us his best try at his ""inovative"" ideas. Some scenes don't cut away for minutes on end, with nothing really going on on screen. Here's a spoiler for you, by the time you're done watching this, you will hate the fact that you gave up 2 hours of your life for this turd! I have not seen the original but it's the same director so I'm not going to bother. Watch the Exorcist again; leave this one on the shelf.

287,willidke,"A Clever Perspective on Horror, but may Confuse Mainstream Audiences",6,13 June 2008,"I had never heard of 'Funny Games' before I saw the trailer for the re-make of the German Original. I was really just expecting a run-of-the-mill horror/thriller movie that entertains, but is forgettable. When I finally saw the film my first reaction afterwords was, ""What on earth just happened?"". The film's style is almost like you're looking through a window into the house where the 'Funny Games' are taking place. The camera makes little movement, and sometimes there are lengthly scenes where it doesn't cut at all. The film is definitely an art film and may be confusing to people expecting a big budget Hollywood blockbuster. The films PROS: There is an EXCELLENT message sent through the movie, about America's growing love for watching gruesome torture and gore on the big screen nowadays. You don't pick up on it the first time you watch it, but you notice that its not so much a movie about a story than it is a statement. There are also brilliant performances from Naomi Watts and the other co-stars. And some scenes are really suspenseful! The Films CONS: For people who are not prone to understanding the hidden meaning underneath art films immediately (like me) you will feel confused, and somewhat frustrated. There are times where it feels like you have to suffer through a 7-minute static shot of the living room and its wounded occupants lying there sobbing until you can get to an interesting situation. Overall 'Funny Games' was an original experience, but one that fails to really deliver a suspense filled 'Mainstream' performance.",Funny Games
288,Kikis2,Wow...,9,15 June 2010,"As many before have said, this will not appeal to everyone. It won't even appeal to the majority, but it certainly leaves its mark. It's a horror filled thriller that feels very different to others of its genre. It's truly original.(If we ignore the fact that it's a shot-by-shot remake of the original Austrian version.)An idyllic bourgeois family on an idyllic bourgeois vacation is held hostage and terrorized by two sweet, well-dressed, psychotic youths. It is all a game. It's a game they've played before, a game they're very good at, and a game they always win. The cast is superb. Watts and Roth are predictably good. Watts plays terrified well and Roth is completely believable as the trapped father, frustrated by his powerlessness. But Michael Pitt with his relatively short resume, which doesn't show, is truly captivating as Paul. His character is odd and captivating and he knows it! We want to know ""why?"" we want to know what's going on in his head and he taunts our desires. Along with his trusty, unstable sidekick, Paul, he's almost comically sociopathic. The absolute horror of the whole event and its perpetrators is what draws us in. It's self-reflexive bits (always reminding us that this is just a film) work well. It breaks the palpable tension with moments of levity, fitting in with the ""this is just a game"" theme. Addressing the camera, considered avant-garde six decades ago, still manages to feel fresh and surprising. We're pulled into Paul's game, we're in on the joke, and its not all that funny.What are their motives for abusing the family? Well, what are our motives for wanting to watch a family abused? It's all in the name of entertainment, babeh. Peter and Paul manage it all with a smile and a wink and some preppy looking outfits. I doubt any one of us makes it through to the other end still feeling that clean. But, hey, give it a try.",Funny Games
289,jburtonprod,Torture Porn Posing as Social Commentary,3,18 March 2008,"Everything in this movie has been done much better in other movies. This is torture porn pretending to be an art house movie. It attempts to shock and presents itself as pushing the limits. A partial list of movies that have accomplished what this festering turd of celluloid attempts: For making us identify with a sadist and scenes of shocking violence ""A Clockwork Orange"" For jarring us by breaking the fourth wall and horrific violence, ""Goodfellas"". For polite and dismissive homicide, Buck Henry's final scene in ""The Man Who Fell to Earth."" For holding up a mirror to the USA, ""There will be Blood"" and finally for innovative use of a remote control, the winner is ""Click"" And the fact is all these movies are far better than ""Funny Games"". (Yes, even ""Click"" is better) Usually, I know a film's in trouble after the third time I look at my watch. This was eleven watch-look movie. The situations presented are so ridiculous and the actions of captive family so utterly stupid that I became incredibly conscious that I was watching a movie in spite of the acting and some times tension creating writing and direction. The movie starts to unravel after the first time Michael Pitt breaks the fourth wall and the scene with the remote control actually produced a collective moan. It was not a moan, as I have read the director thinks, because the audience had just applauded a murder. The killing of either of those two at that point would have justifiable homicide. (What, they don't have that in Austria?) It was because it was easily the dopiest and totally self-negating film gimmick of all time. Nobody seemed to care what happened after that. The acting was good. Michael Pitt is spot on as the lead young psychopath. Brady Corbet is good as the more mindlessly vicious of the two. Naomi Watts is great. The kid Devon Gearhart does at outstanding job of portraying wide wild-eyed terror. It was miserable though to watch the usually fierce Tim Roth as the Uber-Wimp husband.There is some resonance to this movie, but not the good kind that stays with you for days after, like with ""No Country for Old Men"". It's more of an ugliness, a feeling of shame and a feeling of getting betrayed by believing that there could be something redeeming from the experience. The thing that is annoying about this movie is its smugness. It has a finger pointing, tongue clucking under current that insults the audience that is suffering through this stillborn mess. Finally, the United States that this director is holding up the ""mirror"" to doesn't exist. The mirror that he holds up faces him.",Funny Games

So my recommendation is: ""Don't!"" You will end up terribly disappointed knowing that a number of talented actors were wasted on this project. Did they act very well? Yes. But it was like watching well acted scenes from different movies. Taken separately, the performances were great, but tied into the storyline, they were ridiculously out of place. The sociopathic teens were scary in that they lacked the ability to connect. Their perspective was eerie- interesting from the perspective of a psychiatrist trying to figure out the inner workings of delusion and psychopathology. They would go far if they lived in a world where everyone is developed in a vacuum where there is no cause and effect. This incongruence is why the movie is a failure. You will feel a bitter sense of futility gnawing at you because as the movies continues it becomes more and more a waste. You'll want to know why the director wasted your time, why he threw away an excellent beginning, why he, in a sense, prepared such an extravagant meal and then defecated all over it after it was served on the table. So take my advice, and don't try to get away with fourteen of the fifteen early minutes, thinking you will be able to turn it off before the point of no return. You will have already been sucked in.

The movie feels like it has something personally against you and comes off as pretentious.I've read some of the other reviews and it's been mentioned that the director was proving a point and that the movie is like an art piece, etc.But basically, this movie plays out like any old revenge movie. They introduce some villains that inflict damage upon their victims. They continue to build on this, making you crave for brutal justice. And then say no, we knew you would want that, so you can't have it. The end.Take a revenge movie like I Spit on Your Grave. Imagine the girl gets raped over and over and beaten to near death, so that as the movie goes on you start rooting for her more and more to get revenge.

297,jabox-oneandonly,A fantastic movie you should at least give a chance,10,5 May 2018,"From the ratings alone you can see the reception to this movie is 50/50. And the reason isn't solely because anything is done poorly; most agree the acting to the cinematography, etc is done professionally. It's what it says as a film to the viewer that pisses people off. And honestly I'm not going to act like I don't understand it. I mean it sort of wags its finger at you for expecting the outcome. But to me I think it's also a great message and I think we do need it considering the saturation of horror and our numbness to violence in general. (At least what most people interpreted out of it). And even though I understand why people hate the message I still think people are too hard on it. Most films don't even include the audience as a character in the film. And the message doesn't say you're a bad person for expecting the outcome. I mean if you are going to think it's still forced and useless, at least acknowledge the effort gone into it. Any-who the performances were still phenomenal all around. The director took the blueprints of the old house from his previous film and based the new house off that. And despite being a shot-for-shot remake, it was vastly improved on the cinematography front. It's tense, smart, and just a fun experience. Hope I persuaded someone to at least check it out. I tried to keep this spoiler free. Just wanted to explain to people who are on the fence that the ratings are not low graded because it's a poorly made movie rather it's what it has to say. And what I interpret out of the film might be entirely different than what you interpret out of the film.

I supported Paul/Peter because they were giving the family what they really wanted, death. The family was obviously suicidal, each of them, as they were given multiple opportunities to escape and/or overcome Peter/Paul, but they chose to stay, practically begging to be killed. Never before, in any movie, have I seen characters act so stupidly and irrationally.Seriously, this movie sucks. The script writer, casting director, and director should all be permanently banned from Hollywood. Where's the black ball system when you need it? Terrible performance by all involved, poor dialog, and insufferable characters. The only decent thing in this whole movie is the cinematography. I'm used to characters in horror movies acting stupidly, but the actions of these characters is beyond stupid. There is no way that any individuals, that possessed even the slightest survival instincts, would behave this way. The ""bad guys"" routinely provide them opportunities to escape and the choose to ignore each and every one of them.And what kind of house do they have where they can be locked in? Every house I've ever seen has locks that keep people that are outside from coming in. Apparently they live in some sort of area where you need to lock people inside. Oh, and when the mother finally gets her cell phone to work, what does she ask? ""Who should I call?"" Huh, who should they call, how about the police? Oh, and the ""bad guys"" may have locked the gate to their private drive, so what do they do? Well, instead of driving through the gate with their $70,000 Land Rover, they take a pair of pliers and cut through the fence to try to make a run for it. And, they don't want to get the working cell phone from the Land Rover either, for some reason that's never explained.Also, none of them can climb over an eight foot fence, even if their life depended on it, which it does. I seriously wish I could use profanity in my review, as polite language doesn't do justice to my hatred toward these characters.

I survived that nightmare and went on to have a full life. It could have been different.

301,dlt1,"Save your money, this movie sucks",1,6 March 2010,"OK, I admit it. I'm a fan of psychological suspense films, even if they tend to be frustrating. But Funny Games (US) is, to put it mildly, disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the acting is superb, especially from Naomi Watts (who may well turn in her best performance to date). And I guess Tim Roth must be a tremendous actor, because I've pretty much hated every character I've seen him play. The problem with this movie is the writing and directing. A mainstay of comedies and musicals is that the characters are free to break the ""4th wall"" and directly address the audience (or otherwise remind us that we are, in fact, watching a movie). This works OK for comedies/musicals because they're already unrealistic and the mood is already light. But for a psychological thriller to work, it has to be immersive. It has to make us identify with the main characters so that we can mentally put ourselves in their position. In short, a psychological thriller has to thrill us. The bad guys in this movie break the 4th wall (repeatedly), which ruins the realism (and thus the thrill ) of the movie. And frankly, a thriller that isn't thrilling is just a waste of time. And that's exactly what Funny Games (US) is: a waste of time. I felt robbed of about 2 hours of my life after sitting through it. Making bad movies should be a crime.

Maybe people rated this title by confusing it with the original Funny Games. I have no clue. Anyway, I'll try to make this short. The story was bad. The acting.... not so good at times. i.e. In the scene where the mother wants to kick the young men out of her house (before the father appears), I don't know if Ms. Watts didn't know quite what to do in this scene, or we just had a bad camera angle.... but you could tell they were actors, not characters. Other scenes were just too long. I remember wanting to rip my hair out during those, because I couldn't take it anymore! The movie was... how may I put this... slow? Watts' character must have been a bimbo because there were so many things she could've done to save herself and her family. Just to name one, when her friends from across the lake visited, a lady got out of the boat and kissed her on the cheek (if I remember correctly).

It's almost impossible to set aside your disbelief for this scenario.The main thrust is to reiterate again and again that human beings are either mindlessly psychotic animals, or stupid dolts begging for destruction; and to do this in a ""art school"" way that makes the movie largely unwatchable.With that being said, this movie is not recommended for anyone.

Another major difference is that Funny Games is told from the victim's perspective, not the killers.I didn't really know what to think of Funny Games. There is absolutely no character development. You never find out who the two boys are or why they're doing what they're doing. You never find out anything about the family either. The viewer is left with a desire for more knowledge, not knowing what to make of what they've seen. At the very least, the movie will get you thinking, which is more than I can say for most movies these days. The movie begs questions such as why no one is ever killed on screen.

306,bex_nelson,OK but not great!,5,18 January 2009,"When I first started watching this I though it had potential but as the film went on it started to drag. The scenes got longer and it started to lose the audience. I feel that this is what the director wanted to achieve in a way as the start of the film kept the audience's glued to the screen as we knew what was going to happen. Great performances appeared throughout the film especially from Brady Corbet and Michael Pitt. They bring across a lot of emotion especially hatred towards the two. The way Corbet has this soft, creepy voice throughout this makes him appear scary in a way. I am a fan of Michael Pitt especially in the film Bully. I think his acting brings across a lot of emotion and the audience is drawn to this and start to either love or hate him. I love the fact that the director (Michael Haneke) shows the powers of what the director has. For example the way that he plays with the audience's expectations. He does this by giving the audience what they want when Ann shoots Peter. Because the director has made the audience grow hate towards Peter the audience are happy that he is dead. But then Haneke turns it all around by getting Paul to rewind the scene so Peter isn't dead. By Haneke doing this he makes the audience doesn't follow the story anymore. I feel that this technique didn't work because Paul isn't talking to the camera until they start to torture the family. With it not being used continually this makes the audience confused. I did like the story of the film but I feel if it didn't drag out so much towards the end it would of been a lot better. The performances did make the film for me.

This movie wore my patience very thin.I can list several things I did like about the film 1. Decent overly dramatic acting 2. Pretty good job building some suspense in the beginning of the movie. 3. Liked the uncomfortable feeling at some times early on.However, my problems with this movie are abundant: 1. The killers were not intimidating, therefore providing the movie with a ridiculous atmosphere (yes, I know this might be what the director intended... but I found it to be grating and downright annoying) 2. What is up with the dad? I have never seen as large a sniveling wiener as this dude, who can't even hold up his own body weight and stands by as his wife is degraded and more. Again, I know this was supposed to be the effect, but this also makes the movie very irritating to watch. 3. At what point do you stop pleading and start defying. Judging from the way these victims reacted, they would have let the killers rape, murder, cut, rob, without even struggling... let us be real here... and the reaction of the family seemed like they didn't even care their child was killed? I have heard of mothers picking up cars to get to their babies stuck underneath. I didn't see either of those parents go to those lengths. Pathetic. 4. For being billed as a great horror flick, where was the gore? I mean, maybe it is to be tasteful, or maybe it just makes the movie boring. I kept waiting for it, and all they showed were the killers, talking about stupid stuff. Over, and over, again. 5. Who the heck references Beavis and Butthead besides... well... Beavis and Butthead?

Maybe there was a deeper message in it and it was just over my head.I would kinda compare it to ""The Strangers""(Which to me was a great movie). This movie just had no meaning. Nothing good comes out of it. Maybe Naomi Watts may have survived after being pushed out of the boat (Who knows)? If you are looking for a movie that is up lifting, then do not watch this.

Great news... You think? Why did they do all this? For four eggs? and what's with the eggs? Does the director have a thing about eggs? I found it stupid. And extremely slow. The movie was so slow that I almost fell asleep. No tension, no thrill no excitement. All of the ""ugly"" scenes were not shown (when the husband gets stubbed or when the kid gets shot) and were left to the imagination. I really hated it. And finally... the scene with the rewinding. What was that all about... It erased the best part of the film. The part that the viewer takes his pleasure by punishing one of the sick twisted kid....

Then it becomes spoiled brat vibe. But I have to hand it to the film makers and actors the tension for first 40 minutes really works. Some really stunning long scenes that root one and scares you as a viewer.After that there is way too much crying. Hard to understand why it was longer than 80 minutes. We as an audience had enough already. Come on!! The ending was pure frustration. Beautiful camera work.

They were constantly put in further peril for the sake of ""entertainment"". And for this reason, I was completely enthralled. I was glued to the screen, wondering what the group's exact fate was. It was at that point that I realized, the only way to help them is to turn away and leave the rest to my imagination as it becomes extremely clear just where everything is going.I couldn't though. It may have been my addiction to violent tension, it could have been sheer curiosity, it could have been anything. However, one thing was certain, I could not deter my fascination. As a result, I witnessed bizarre and brutal events at my own expense.Framing was excellent, pacing was wildly inconsistent(but to the point of consistency), and cinematography/sound were executed correctly.

I understand, you don't like reality and want to live in a fairy-tale with your pink glasses on? Carry on. This is all this movie is about. People reviewing this movie as one of the worst because it is violent? You must have been warned! That this is a horror/thriller film, if you hate the genre, so don't even watch it! Why would you rate it then? So maybe you think this is some cheap Hollywood horror story about demons and ghosts? Maybe you thought it is a chasing-shooting criminals police story? No it is not. This movie is a reflection of the sick world we living in. You can never be safe.This movie is a senseless act of violence? If you don't get the meaning, it does not mean that it is meaningless! I've seen somebody comparing this movie to Natural Born Killers and reviewed both as meaningless and the worst movies ever seen. So you actually think that every act of violence has to be justified, dont you? You don't care watching a movie about war, when heroic americans are killing innocent vietnamese or muslims in the east. You don't care when your superhero kills innocent policemen who maybe have a family and children and just doing their job to catch them? You're just all ignorant and hypocritical. This movie is all that about. Maybe you are lucky to be rich and you don't see what happens in the world of the poor and the middle class. You may be a beta male living in your mansion and all you care is your wristwatch and a tennis course. What do you think would have happened if there were 2 black guys instead trying to get help from these people in this movie? If they are lucky enough to get this deep into the neighborhood unnoticed, as soon as they rang a bell, the police would have been there. Now these two white psychopaths just got inside the house, because they came just like they would themselves. Kindly and politely asking for help, same category of richmen, with 2000$ worth of tennis clothes on. That is this movie all about, that you think you are rich and safe in your house, millions of dollars worth, but you're not. If someone knows your rules, they can reach you really easy and punish you, face to face, as a beta male you can't do anything. What about looking at the pop culture nowadays? There are teenagers rapping about how dealing drugs, being in a gang, having gun, having a prison time are so cool. Youngsters love them so much. Same as in the movie Natural Born Killers, how some psychopath couple went on their bloody rampage through the country and became idols for the youth because of the press. I think something like this actually happened in USA before this movie. Of course, being edgy is always cooler than studying and working all your life. If you had any brains of your own in this life, you would understand why it is so hard for young people to accept the fate of your life in the modern society.

This movie is a shot for shot remake from the same director. Before going into this movie you should know that Funny Games is not necessarily intended for entertainment purposes as more of an experience, trying to tell you something. At times this movie can be tough to watch for some viewers as this film picks more of psychological thrills, then extreme gore. Michael Haneke constantly aims for veering away from Horror movie clichés and typical styles. The obvious theme in this movie is to in some way mock the horror/ torture porn genre, and in someways just violence in film. In a way he questions you for even way this movie. In my opinion it is worthing of being made, although at times comes of pretentious. Naomi Watts is grey in this, and gives a intelligent a believable performance. Tim Roth, OK in it but seems to be playing more of a archetype more then anything. Violence is done casually and unpredictably, which makes it even more cringe inducing and hard to watch. Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet are really the stars of the movie. They are believable kidnappers and truly seem psychotic, which elevates every scene they share. Sometimes weirdly funny, most of the time messed up, they break the fourth wall often, and cheat death( commentary on violence and movie clichés) Definitely not for everyone, but once you see it you will think about it for a while.",Funny Games
327,pizzo-2,You must see this film! WOW!,1,2 July 2012,"If you take a small pile of cow manure and spread it across a white canvas and perhaps call it Opus #1 you can convince someone that it's art. The director of ""Funny Games"" is trying to make some obtuse argument about plausibility in film which he details in the ""rewind"" scene, but this film is neither plausible nor credible. The only purely sadistic crime of notoriety in American history was the Leopold and Loeb case. Crimes such as the Pettite family murders in Connecticut were committed for money and on a larger scale the Holocaust was government sponsored sadism. The psychopaths in this film are committing crimes without motive and its preposterous to think that the crimes would go undiscovered. But what is even more unrelenting is the notion that the audience must not be permitted a catharsis because other films would. So for art's sake the director purports absurdity. By doing so he creates a story without an ending for the sole purpose of shocking an audience. The bottom line is that even if you are making no point at all it requires some credibility to make it. Naomi Watts thought she was making a film about the Holocaust and Michael Pitt wants to make existentialism his gift to film, too bad its necessary to make a good film first. Michael Pitt has become a bore and Naomi Watts is spending too much time in the Hamptons.",Funny Games

It is the only movie that I have not been able to finish watching because it is too good, or rather so well executed (I eventually fast forwarded through the second half).This movie is visceral and disturbing. It deliberately sets up red hearings that play on cinema convention; for instance the close up of the knife that's forgotten on the boat at the beginning. In a regular movie this little detail would come back and save the day; not so in this film.The audience gets no satisfaction from this movie, so from that perspective it should get a zero star rating. On the other hand this film does exactly what it sets out to do and it does it brilliantly, with so much tension and would therefore deserve a 10.I'm really undecided. This film is brilliantly acted and directed but it made me so angry. I forgot that it was just a film. I wanted to be in it so that I could smash the skulls of the intruders against something hard until I killed them or they killed me.

Many people will see this and think that the movie is just ""torture porn"", but it is much more. Haneke has created a movie that is disturbing in many ways. One is the fact that Haneke is daring us to see this movie. He is telling us to come and sit through the most disturbing, nihilistic, and perverse movie that he has ever made. The trailer does make this movie look fun, but it is a total joke to get you to see the movie. Another disturbing thing about the movie is the story itself. These two nihilistic men just want to go as far as they can to make us, the audience, suffer. Yet, we suffer in a different way. The suffering is not like Saw or Hostel movies, but totally different. We get tortured and abused because of how much we want to see violence. He gives us the violence and makes us go through with the pain.

Even thou the movie was good, I still wouldn't watch it again because it was too unpleasant to watch. I think this movie was trying show us what kind of evil exists out there in the world. The film is about two sadists who terrorizes and tortures a family. Why I thought it was unpleasant to watch this movie was because you got depressed watching it and while watching it you where filled with so many emotions (not like that is a bad thing).

And I'm told this whole film was to make me aware of my own blood lust when I go to the cinema, my own voyeuristic sinfulness, my own culpability? I don't know. That violence is bad. I think for as long as Greek drama has been around and even longer than that, violence in art/movies/theater is cathartic and therapeutic, relieves tension and actually reduces violence. And call me crazy, but I like to see justice prevail and if it doesn't, and you want to break with tradition, give me a reason! These little guys that come in and kill strangers for no reason anyone is aware of, not even them. If this is OK with you, then these are scary times indeed.

What horrifies me even more than this movie, is that the US and their people are leading the cultural revolution of the world and are leading us into the future. Oh my God, like Americans would say. God bless America and its fine people.

But the message the director wants to convey not only seems to polarise but also triggers certain misconceptions.The way Michael Haneke transforms this theme into cinematic language and wittingly discomposes the audience in such an intelligent way is really fascinating. And obviously, the exclusion or, to be more accurate, the degeneration of any formulaic character development is not accidental but of course contributes to the overall disturbing mood the film strives to create. Haneke does not want the audience to simply consume what is presented, he tries to involve the viewer emotionally by depicting the two antagonists as cold-blooded, intelligent and calculating and their actions as a senseless, cynical form of personal entertainment that remains unpunished.The recipient is left alone filling the psychological gaps in order to interpret what is seen - senseless homicides and innocent victims in a brutal, degenerated environment.

338,abonin01,This film is for people that enjoy artistic cinema...not horror.,9,14 September 2009,"This is basically an art film that berates the audience for their insatiable appetite for witnessing suffering in films. The original version of this film received a great deal of critical acclaim overseas, however North Americans were definitely not ready for it as many reviews and posts have shown.This film is not a suspense thriller-type film; yes, it contains violence and yes, there is suspense, but these are tools implemented by the director to make a statement. The film is rife with dialogue that will prove to be very thought-provoking for viewers that have an affinity for being challenged by film, rather than simply being entertained by blood splatter, nudity and pyrotechnics for an hour and a half.Films like this are an acquired taste: someone will need to enjoy the more subtle and artistic qualities of film to actually enjoy this movie. There are extremely unsettling and difficult to watch parts, there are also seemingly ""boring"" parts, however all of the components in this film are intended to convey a strong message to the viewer and in turn, allow them to actually walk away with something after.Once again: if you don't enjoy films that force you to interpret almost every aspect of a film down to dialogue, camera work, directing and the like(aka: challenging films), then this is a poor choice for you to watch. If you are still on the fence about whether you want to see this film, here is are a few questions for you...-Do you like Werner Herzog, Harmony Korine, David Lynch and/or Jim Jarmusch? -Do you enjoy films that are legitimately difficult to watch during some scenes? Keep in mind that ""difficult to watch"" does not necessarily mean a graphic or sex scene...for example; it could be something like a scene that shows a character in the aftermath of witnessing something absolutely horrible and emotionally crushing in great detail.-Do you consider yourself someone that enjoys films that seek to make a statement and try to do something that has never been done in film before?If you answer ""yes"" to these questions(especially the middle question), then you will enjoy this film, if not, then you should look elsewhere. Just like paintings, not all films will be pleasing to an individual. Some people like to have things spelled-out in plain terms and interpret more beautiful and apparent aspects of the work. Other people enjoy paintings where little is clear, things appear ugly and foreign, and they are forced to draw their own conclusions without any sort of certainty as to whether or not they ""get it"".I apologize for how lengthy this write-up is, but it is very irritating to see people tear art down because they don't understand it or don't have a taste for it. Some films are simply garbage without artistic merit and there is nothing to understand, but anyone that has ever interpreted film or writing should be able to determine very quickly by many of the dialogues and the way scenes are shot in Funny Games, that it is an art film, not a typical Hollywood film that seeks to entertain the viewer and do nothing else than take an hour and a half of their life away from them that they will never get back.If you find yourself nodding while reading this review, I can positively guarantee that you will...not necessarily ""enjoy"", but be very pleased that you saw this film and actually get something out of it that may stay with you as a film enthusiast.",Funny Games
339,jakesnice,"Wow...Disturbing, Smart, and Interesting",10,22 April 2008,"I first saw a preview of Funny Games on t.v. It caught my eye and I was immediately interested. I knew from the start Funny Games was gonna be something somewhat different, but soon figured out it was an understatement. It is a beautifully shot film with amazing cinematography that enhances the beautiful scenery as well as the graphic nature of this film. Many scenes are shot in real time for long periods which I think personally captures the terror of the victims. Many moments seem unexpected when you soon find out the two psychopaths literally involve you in the horrific torture of the family as well as having no musical score except for the occasional interrupting of brutally thrashing metal music. The two actors who play the psychos are frightening and realistic in there sick nature as well as the victims are disturbingly believable and convince you of their horrible distress. Funny Games does not hold back. It has no sympathy and regret. It flat-out slaps you in the face for the violence in media and how our society is taking it in as entertainment. This movie is not entertaining to watch. It gets under your skin and stays there. It makes you feel bad for watching it, yet you can not look away from the screen.

I rented it and after the first 5 minutes I regretted it.The director possibly tries to be artistic in his scene choices, but the length of time that he uses for a shot brings the entire movie to a grinding halt every time something happens. When some one is being chased or if someone is nervous it may be a good idea to express that by using more choppy editing. As opposed to staying focused on shoes/feet/random dark space for more than 2 minutes. The entire film is riddled with shots with speaking that is not shown on camera, opting for a close up of shoes under the stairwell instead. Which would be a nice cut away if the said shoes/stairwell was a key point later in the film.Also, if you are going to have a thriller about people who are keeping someone hostage in their own home, let's use something more menacing than a golf club. There are only a few things that would have been thrilling in the whole movie and they are so far between that you can get up, go to the bathroom, grab a beer and not miss a single plot element.",Funny Games

I hate watching torture movies anyway but what the heck was up with the bad guys talking to the camera and using the remote to rewind the guy getting shot. That totally made this movie stupid. As if it wasn't bad enough with the shots of Naomi watts sitting in the floor for 10 minutes before she got up to get untied and the other shots that lasted entirely too long. So so bad!

Although it was pretty harsh that they killed the poor kid, and they practically got away with the entire family's murder, something intrigued me about this movie. The two main ""terrorizers,"" as I might call them, were brilliant together. About an hour and twenty minutes into the movie, I thought the two surviving parents were actually going to make it through and probably get revenge on their son or something. But it always comes down to the end, where the two young sociopaths return to finish the job and go for their next victim. It certainly deserves recognition among those cult classics. Sort of reminds me of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, which is another one of my favorite films of all time.

Indeed, when I found out that Michael Haneke was the person who had remade it, I hunted it down almost immediately. It was going to be interesting to see whether we had something along the lines of the previous, a tough, gritty but compelling watch, or another watered down Hollywood remake. Well, its as though he's cut out the original cast, and placed in American (and Australian) counterparts. It is an exact copy, and after a slight feeling or disappointment, I realised this was the most fitting remake for it. Why change something that has you on the edge of your seat, teasing you, sucking you into it's world (exactly what Michael Haneke set out to do in the first place). This is a nasty piece of work, but thats what makes you watch on...A family arrive at their vacation home. Father and son set up the boat, while mother prepares dinner. A young, well-to-do gentlemen comes to the door and asks to borrow some eggs. Another well-to-do gentlemen appears and asks to test out a golf club thats in the hallway.Thats when the 'funny games' begin.

Professional acting from all parties, especially the invaders ... who look like the boys from next door, but chillingly deliver their actions and motives in a gentle but invasive disturbing manner.No blood and gore needed in this ... in fact I felt like I was in there with the main characters ... not feeling frustrated by their reactions, but identifying with their powerlessness. Their reactions were realistic, believable and hopeless. No fairy tale ending here... just pure soul destroying and sickening craziness from the invaders, and despairingly realistic reactions from the victims. More scary for what it does not say, than for what it does.

351,marco-491,Mixed feelings about this,9,5 August 2009,"My dad suggested we should watch ""Funny Games U.S.:, so we did. I have to admit that I was hooked until the movie ended, but I wasn't hooked to find out how the story progresses, but more hooked about what the next thing was that the sadistic madmen were gonna do to the family members. The story is very predictable, and, because it has been done so many times before, quite boring. The family is stupid and I did not really care about them, at all. I admit that I even had to smile sometimes when I saw the things the madmen did with them. But, that's what Mr. Hanneke is trying to show us: how normal it is in our world and in the media to take someone's life. It happens in the film like it is normal. The white gloves that the sadistic madmen wear makes them even creepier for me. I really enjoyed their wardrobe. The reason for giving this film a 5 is because there's just too many flaws in this film, that also has some great parts. For instance, what really bothered me is this one scene where Naomi Watts and Tim Roth should've stopped thinking rationally and go totally bonkers, but, no, they just go on with figuring out what to do to save themselves. I do have to praise Mr. Hanneke for the risk he takes with this film, breaking with conventional rules that apply to thriller-film-making, (for instance, not having any original score for a film that is mostly dialogue). In the end, the thought behind the film is great (death has become so normal in our lives) but the way the thought is being presented as a film is just horrible, the writing a flawed (though the politeness the madmen have totally freaked me out), the cinematography is awful and unpersonal (too distant), the acting of the two madmen is superb, but the family was portrayed by Tim, Naomi and Devon as dolls, static and unnatural, and the lack of music also made me feel that something was missing. This is a film that only a select number of people will enjoy. As a film student, I was stunned to see Mr. Haneke breaking all the conventional rules, but in the end, felt that (even though I hate conventional Hollywood-rules) the use of conventional Hollywood-rules would've resulted in a better, unnerving film.5 out of 10",Funny Games

There are so many long, true to real time, shots that are very Kubrick-y. Some people find this boring or slow (I do sometimes, depending on the film), but it works here.
The mise en scene is impressive, everything from the camera angles, character placement, the use of sound in some of the scenes, etc... I was truly in awe. The acting is the only thing that could improve, but only with a few of the characters.
At different times I found myself: laughing, feeling sad, being shocked, on the edge of my seat, and even a jump scare or two.

An avid fan of the horror/thriller genre, I took a friend who hates those kinds of movies. I walked into the theater when the final screen shot was still on the screen, which was Michael Pitt's face. It was incredibly scary and from that point on I was freaked out. The movie started and didn't take too long to get to the point. For my friend and I, my friend especially, it was very frustrating. Not the movie, but the way Paul and Peter (or any of the several names they call each other) treats Naomi Watts' family at first. They keep saying, ""I'm sorry"" when it's not necessary and after a while it got annoying. The scenes take like 20 minutes to get through (ok, that's an exaggeration but you get the idea). There are some scenes where all you can think is that something is going to pop out. But sadly, it doesn't. In my opinion, the freakiest part of the movie is Michael Pitt's facial expressions when he's talking to the audience through the camera. All in all I enjoyed the movie.

They do it for the entertainment and they are ALWAYS in control. It is very excruciating to watch at times. The film feels very raw and real time and as I said, VERY well acted.The family are relatable, realistic and we feel nothing but the utmost sympathy for them. As for the villains of the piece; they have an insane logic and at no point do we feel assured by them despite their calm exterior. They are ruthless and polite at the same time.If you are easily disturbed, this may upset you...a lot. Despite the title this film is in no way funny (aside from it cynical black humour).

Every guy knows, a scary movie is best because there's always the chance that your girl will get scared and need you to comfort her; but you don't want to end up in the bathroom washing her puke off. There are so many parts in this film that make you cringe just because you know what happened and what's coming; but there is hardly even any blood.Next, the acting is really superb- Tim Roth and Naomi Watts have the crying and screaming part down. The only problem I have with the film, in fact, comes not from the actors at all, but instead the director. To save our lives (get it, a film about murder and torture? saving our lives... nevermind), my girl and I could not come up with a solid reason for or point that the director was trying to make with this film. I don't mean we didn't like it, we both thoroughly enjoyed it, we just couldn't make up our minds about what the film's maker was trying to say.Like I said, part of what made this film so great comes from who I saw it with, so make sure you go with a loved one or a close friend- it really wouldn't be the same seeing it alone. The whole audience seemed to love it from what I heard of the spurts of laughter (which is something I really didn't expect) and I couldn't tell of one person I saw leaving and shaking their head.

Underused, unappealing, uninteresting, & ultimately unimportant to the narrative. They're the most known actors in the film, yet they're not the central characters.

370,marcywashere,I've slid down the rabbit hole,4,8 December 2016,"I just watched this movie for the first time. Never heard of it before or knew it was a remake. I purposely came to this site because the viewers are well read with director quotes which I have not personally read,and I like seeing other points of view. I watched the beginning 20ish minutes a second time unsure as to what to think of my initial feelings of the family and damn if they weren't still there. So the point of the movie was only to show that Americans are violence blind or obsessed? The fact that the actual violence off screen is suppose to show this? Hearing death and mourning are just as terrifying to me, but this is not my point. I immediately connected the boys to Leopold and Loeb. We saw this before in Hitchcock's Rope. The movie does an awesome job of setting up the family profile and their vacation quickly. I'm not sure about anyone else, but Naomi's character made me uncomfortable and awkward the way she treated him over eggs. Although she was polite enough, and him strange enough, I suppose if someone broke 4 eggs I had just handed them I wouldn't have thought twice to have given him 4 more. With the carton for Petes sake or a bowl to someone with gloves no less. Nor do I go around slapping people in the face for snarky comments. Especially when they are weird, your wife's been trying to tell you stuffs been going down,and there are 2 of them in your house and friends of these people you know. I kept waiting for the young psychopaths to elaborate on the begging for eggs and an unwarranted slap to the face as this is actually the first violent act we witness. There is a realness upon letting even this weirdo in your house. I mean he's with the peeps next door, and for politeness sake you wouldn't want to think too long before opening the door, but then that's the thing. When people start giving me the vibe, I'm not pushing buttons. Definitely if I've let them in my house. I'm still not sure that this point is mute. If the director feels Americans are fake polite and easily frustrated, as he does about how we see violence,anyway. I really was expecting a motive to come to light...they go around doing this to people who act selfishly to some eggs and are curt etc. What it just appears to be is these kids version of their movie real or imagined and that these are the type of people that deserve this. In their heads, they'd be funny about eggs when they could buy the farm. Humdrum rich kid problems, drugs, boredom or horrific acts of incest causing everyday polite young sociopaths to murder everyday polite rich white people who'd slap your face because they can. I don't think this movie guy thinks a lot about me. Maybe that's just the point. I'm not a gore fan, but love a thriller. Didn't think I was getting into a gory movie, but if you have any imagination gore is what you'll get. I came here to actually find a psychological meaning for the killing. It's like finding out Billy Squires Stroke Me isn't about stroking nothing but an ego from producers. So a pretty gruesome movie, made by a guy who says Americans either don't know it, or do and don't care. Well, he should know gore he just killed an entire family. Smh",Funny Games

I know its a build up but fu*k.. i kinda wish that the kidnapped family opened their mouths more than every 10 etc. minutes. Realistically thoughts tend to have a lot of power and influence to pretty much anyone so it was uncomfortable to at least not know the so called 'fictitious' family more. I believed Peter and Paul were maniacs, i didn't really believe that the family were rightly cast-ed?It's a tough one because it relies on a good concept but with long dragging scenes with what i can probably say have not much going on, i found it hard to be sucked in. the atmosphere leading to the kids death was intense in a way, but then f*ck all not even a glimpse really of whats going on and then a sh*t load of blood on the TV. - it didn't give me time to feel any pain (relevant then i guess)Needless to say it's a film that is pretty much made for psychopaths and that's why a lot of people get put off. Anyone can admit that the dog at the start was too loud though, should have got a muzzle you stupid family :) - jokes6.5/10",Funny Games

And that's not what this film was, anyone who says so is still reeling from what this film portrays.This film is a STORY, just like 'No Country For Old Men'. You're not supposed to like it, that's just how the story went. I'll admit I was not completely settled with the ending, but that's only because film maker Michael Heneke shatters our idea with what was ""supposed to happen"" with what actually happened.I can definitely see why so many people are upset with this movie, but just because a movie doesn't meet someone's expectations doesn't mean it is a bad movie.

That Ann didn't have the presence of mind to say ""Don't moor your boat here, this kid is a nutter and he's holding us hostage"" is unbelievable. I know she (Ann) might have been too nervous to do much but I really can't see that simply doing nothing at this point would have been her choice.I know we're supposed to sit back and not question things too much (see the remote control in the movie) but I really would prefer these scenes to work.I think the point being made is that it doesn't matter how much a movie declares itself to the audience (Paul's addressing camera and the whole rewind section, etc) we are still enthralled by a macabre fascination with what happens next. We are scared so deliciously that we don't care if we can see that director-baker flicking bogies into the dough.",Funny Games
374,freakyfriend2001,Genius; works just as well if not better than it did the first time.,9,23 March 2008,"This seems to be a film that splits audiences (like with the original; see RottenTomatoes for the like/dislike examples of opinion for both versions) and don't the best films? I think you either just don't ""get it"" and therefore don't like it, you do ""get it"" but just don't appreciate it or you do ""get it"" and really appreciate it. I am in the latter category, for both the 1997 version and the updated, almost shot-for-shot American version.Like Haneke's previous Cache (of which feels like possibly a second chapter of what he was trying to say with Funny Games in '97) the film is ice cold and uncompromising from start to finish, never once swaying you either way with regards to what he wants you to feel. In '97 I think Funny Games worked fantastically and I had my doubts that the American, presumably more widely appealing version would have much point to it. But in my opinion this version works just as well, perhaps even better than the original. The main reason being, in my opinion, that it is suited more to not only American movies but the state of violence in the country in general.What I love about this film (again; both versions) is the directors commentary on the state of violence in movies (American specifically) and more importantly it plays with audience expectation. When the white-wearing smart home invader turns to the camera and says ""I bet you're on their side"" and ""Do you want a plot development?"" the director is basically showing that we are all used to the same stuff happening in films, especially of this kind, and this film is refusing to be that way. This point is made even stronger when the infamous ""rewind"" scene occurs. Usually in movies of this nature the family will be kidnapped and terrorized by villains we are forced to hate because of their criminal nature and behaviour. The director allows the conventional plot point to happen, the mother picking up the gun and overcoming the bad guys, but as soon as he's dangled the expected safety in front of you he then proceeds to snatch it back by rewinding the film to the point where the character can knowingly prevent that expected action. This is, in fact, a stroke of genius. The whole film is in fact.Some may say that if the director is commenting on violence in movies then why is he proceeding to have violence in it at all? Well are we forgetting that the violence happens explicitly OFF-screen. This avoids any controversy because of what's on-screen but creates plenty, and perhaps more, by having it off-screen. It all comes down to whether you ""get it"" and if you appreciate what he's trying to do or not. Pretentious, I hear you say? Genius, is more like it.",Funny Games

380,katycharlotte-1,So much more than just 'torture porn'.,10,2 April 2014,"'Funny Games' is an American remake of a European movie of the same name from 1997. Both the original and the American remake were written and directed by Michael Haneke, so it is not too surprising that in many ways the two movies are identical, from the plot to the dialogue (translated from its original German into English), to the camera shots and the sets that were used. Michael Haneke states that his main reason for making this new version was to make the movie more accessible to an American audience.To give a brief breakdown of the plot, we have a stereotypical upper-middle class American family, Ann Farber (Naomi Watts), George Farber (Tim Roth) and their little boy Georgie Farber (Devon Gearhart) who while staying at their beautiful summer vacation home receive an unexpected visit by two seriously unstable young men (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet). Their idyllic holiday rapidly becomes a desperate struggle for survival as they are subjected to all kinds of sadistic games inflicted on them by two eloquent, mild-mannered young men, with a taste for murder and torture.While this might sound like an average seen-it-all-before horror/thriller that entertains the main-stream movie goers, 'Funny Games' is definitely in a class of its own. It is a smart, edgy, satirical movie confronting head-on many uncomfortable issues about the frequently extreme violence promoted to us through Hollywood movies such as 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' -to name just a few, and the concern that maybe we as an audience are becoming immune to all of it due to America's growing appetite for watching blood, gore and torture in movies, and that violence is being normalised in the eyes of the media.The first thing that hits you when you are watching this movie is the unusual style that directly goes against many of the commonly used conventions that we as an audience have become accustomed to. There is very little camera movement throughout the movie and there are a couple of notably lengthy scenes where very little seems to be happening, which are completely uncut. Sometimes this can be quite frustrating to sit through, particularly one scene when all you're shown is a five minute static shot of the outside of the house and you find yourself fast-forwarding just to get to the next interesting situation. Another interesting thing this movie does is it frequently breaks the imaginary 'fourth-wall', when the character Paul directly addresses the audience and comments on the violence that is taking place and what he anticipates will be the audience's reaction to it, For example: Paul turns toward camera, breaks fourth wall, addressing the audience] Paul: ""I mean, what do you think? You think they stand a chance? Well, you're on their side, aren't you? Who are you betting on, hmm?""By taking away the 'fourth-wall', the movie also takes away our comfort zone.To summarize, I think this an exceptionally powerful movie which manages to combine a wicked twist of a story with a powerful statement about the impact of Hollywood on our society today and is definitely worth going to see!",Funny Games

383,danstefik,Don't You Get It?,10,6 December 2008,"This film is brilliant. It's so painfully obvious at this point. How many films prompt people to go out of their way in order to chastise a director for the experience he or she has just put them through? The answer? Not many. But Funny Games is definitely one of them, and all these negative responses to the film speak volumes about the attitudes of the average film-goer. Haneke did his job, and that was to get people talking about cinema. And whether the people that criticize the film have anything worthwhile to say is besides the point (because they usually don't) because the film has obviously gotten under their skin and into their guts. And that is exactly what films that represent (or mediate) violence should do. So in effect, Haneke gets an A+ for being one of the most important filmmakers alive - and anyone who studies film seriously knows that for a fact - and all these moronic film-goers (through no fault of their own apart from ignorance or lack of education) go on rants castigating this poor man that has enough of a soul to call a spade a spade when he sees one. The spade is that senseless violence devoid of context, moralizing, or affect is outright insulting coming from a society that is one, if not the the most violent nations in recent history. The people that slam this film buy into illusions, like most dissatisfied people do. They have an insatiable palate for violence, the sicker the more rewarding, As long as it doesn't really get to them and they don't have to think about what they are watching. Funny Games is a wake-up call to a sick nation, and whether or not Haneke is preaching to the converted or not is besides the point. Some filmmakers are looking out for us, those who might have some insight into the medium. Haneke is one of these filmmakers and that is what makes him such a force in the cinema world.

From reading interviews with the director, I believe the message is that people like watching violent film and that makes them bad people. Well, I love violent films, I'm not a bad person, and this movie isn't anything new. Funny Games doesn't work as a thriller (too formulaic) and doesn't work as a message film (too pretentious).Two times in the film, the killer talks directly to the audience and reminds us that we are watching the film to be entertained.

It has left a lasting impression as I am sure Michael Haneke intended.This film is a shot-by-shot remake of 1997 film of the same name and by the same director. Haneke reason for remaking his original film only ten years later: so his message could reach a broader audience. The film is unlike the latest horror/slasher flick to have come out of Hollywood as there is an apparent lack of violence. Haneke crafts a horror film that builds the audience up to the violence and then turns on them and has all of the violence take place off screen, which is scarily unsatisfying.The performances in the film, especially Pitt's and Corbett's, are astounding as they play two psychotic killers who are terrorizing a wealthy family, Watts, Roth and Gearhart, in their summer home.

397,drew1986,Dismal Diatribe (that describes the movie and my review),1,12 April 2008,"ZERO ENTERTAINMENT VALUE. Decent acting. Decent cinematography.An annoyingly lengthy portrayal of exactly what it means to comment on. I watched this movie before reading or seeing anything about it. After I was certain the movie would have no entertainment factor I stopped viewing the movie around half way and just skimmed ahead to confirm my suspicions (thankfully I stole this movie and these filmmakers/actors will not receive a penny from me for their contrived effort...not too many times can I say that completely guilt-free). Had I saw this movie in theaters I would have certainly demanded my money back.The movie attempts to make a statement about violence in media, particularly American media. It effectively presents the statement I suppose; however, the exact statement is unclear and it is supposed to be somewhat open-ended. I say ""somewhat"" because it certainly appears the director/writer is wanting violence-ridden Americans to realize how de-sensitized and wanton they've become in their entertainment through questioning why they've watched the movie. The message seems forced, naive and idealistic.To restate... this film serves PRECISELY ZERO entertainment value. A better forum for this topic might be in a sociological thesis. However, even as a thesis this movie still doesn't bring any new topics to the table (in 1997 or 2008). Frankly the self-critical paternal voice of this and other media annoys me much more than it ever convinces. People DON'T kill people because they see it on TV. They kill people because they WANT to kill people.As for violence as a whole... violence is violence...it is not good, it is not bad, it is violence. Any other treatment of the matter is simply ivory tower spouting. Certainly saying violence is unnecessary is nothing more than a decadent idea of a kid-hands approach to society. As for violence as entertainment, if we are entertained by it, then it is not exactly surprising. We are human after all. WE ARE VIOLENT. OUR NATURE IS VIOLENCE (fighting is far older than media) get over it already. If anyone wishes to rid the world of this way of thinking it will certainly take a healthy dose of violence.",Funny Games

The games include the unbearable screaming death metal, the long, tedious shots which torture us, the tempting of violence which never amount to much on screen, the teasing of how the family actually has a shot and the manipulation of events(the remote). Nevertheless, with that said I did not hate the movie. I actually kind of liked it. It was original, had solid acting, and was pretty funny. If you don't like movies with subtitles you probably won't like this, even though it has no subtitles, but it is a remake of a foreign film that is exactly the same and is done in the European style.

I say that when an actor plays the bad guy and he gets audience to dislike him or even hate him, then he is a good actor for sure. Those guys did that. But also Naomi Watts and Tim Roth did a good job. So i only rate this film as awful, because of his writer and director... Mr. Michael Haneke. It was maybe the worst scenario i have ever seen in a film in my entire life...but then again, i didn't expect much quality from Michael Haneke (Cache rings any bells?).Irritating, sick and appalling as an concept (scenario), with unnecessary extremely long scenes (again like Cache) which made it boring and of course TWISTED SENSE OF ART are forming the remake (please God help us not again) of his own!!! film in 1997.Some people say, that his intention was to glorify mindless violence and what humans ""hide"" inside their minds.

Neither way, this was just too stupid.What we saw in that film, it isn't real. 2 young guys killing from door to door, time travel by a remote control...

Despite a lack of complaints against the film's acting, the movie is terribly slow and aggravating. At some points, the camera does not shift while the audience is forced to watch absolutely nothing happen for minutes at a time. On top of that, the two killers are intolerably polite despite their murderous intentions.Additionally, the film's lack of dynamics leaves you feeling neither engaged nor entertained. Most of the movie's torture doesn't actually occur on screen; instead, the frivolous, tedious dialogue pains the viewers as much as the captives. This movie didn't make me think, didn't give me a sense of gratification at the end, and really just kept me feeling uncomfortable the entire time I watched it. Admittedly, an attempt was made to give this movie some meaning in the end, but throwing in two or three lines of thematic dialogue doesn't get the job done.If you like the mindless violence of some movies, but want less in the way of story-telling and entertainment, watch this movie immediately.

The thought of your safety being ruined by anything is terrifying. Home should be your safe place and there should be nothing unwanted that invades that space. That is why movies like The Strangers, Inside, You're Next, or Panic room work so well. Funny Games starts off with an upper class family, played her by Naomi Watts, Time Roth and Devon Clearhart, drive to a lake property. Almost immediately they get a visit from a young man Peter (Brady Corbet in a great performance) that is introduced as a friend of a neighbor. From the moment he enters the home of our family we know that things are not all right. He is joined by his co nemesis Paul (played by the always creepy Michael Pitt). The moment they are in the families home our villains set off a horrible 12 hours for our characters. I am dedicated to making sure my reviews are spoiler free. With that I will say that there is a lot of nothing happening in my opinion. There is the start of what could be some horrible situations but they seem to not come to fruition. There is also a lot of breaking the 4th wall in this movie. The hardest thing I had with this movie though is the characters. All of our family members are in a crisis and yet they seem to not know or care. The moments that really tore me apart seemed to have little to no significance to the characters. They go through slow movements and I feel were supposed to create a tension that the audience was supposed to buy. Unfortunately, I didn't buy and I wanted a refund. This is a shot-for-shot remake, even the sets were reused, of the directors 1997 version of the same film. The director wanted to show audiences his ""moralistic comment about the influence of media violence on society"". The ending included one of the most worse twists. I know there was a moral message I was supposed to feel. The problem was none of the characters were feeling it either so I could not connect with them.",Funny Games

The preview makes it out to be a great thriller/horror movie but, ironically enough anytime in this movie there is any violence they just pan away and the one time you do they just take the whole scene back almost out of spite or just to annoy you. The whole point of the one OC preppy guy talking to the audience was almost to point out the director knew what you wanted to happen and more or less did the opposite. The end of the movie when they are all on the boat and they are talking about fiction and non fiction seemed to me like the director was explaining that in reality the way the movie was played out is the way it would happen in real life and not how most standard horror movies play out. This movie is like the strangers but worse the main characters do nothing to save themselves (nothing smart anyways) so you almost do even feel sorry for them and you don't care and sit there afterwords wondering why you watched this POS but in this movie i think that was the point, the director wanted you to feel stupid for watching it.REGARDLESS I HATE IT SILL.P.S. if you want to get a better idea of what this movie was really trying to say then read some of ther loved it posts there's some good points.",Funny Games

406,stephengiffin-2,Haneke's misuse of the medium,10,18 October 2009,"Firstly, I've given this a 10/10 purely on its technical expertise at presenting a very valid observation of modern media and audience expectations. However, this should have been presented as a documentary or commentary of cinema violence, not as a bona fide movie in the conventional sense of the word.Basically, any unsuspecting audience will come away from watching this movie feeling conned as it breaks so many of the unwritten rules we come to expect from our movie going experience. The film's message is wasted as people make a choice to see movies; for shocks, for laughs, for gore, for sex, for terror, for deep emotion, for whatever poison they wish to taste, not to be lectured.It is an excellent piece of work that unfortunately requires an introduction from the director to explain the context of what we are about to see, to get across it's true meaning. He (and the distributors) shoot themselves in the foot (off screen, naturally) by presenting this as a movie, with movie stars, with excellent production values, but an unconventional and deceptive narrative.Cinema should be deconstructed, but in school, not in the very medium it wishes to deconstruct - unless you warn us. Whilst I congratulate him on successfully presenting his message, it must be equally disappointing to discover that the general mass audience doesn't care. Movies are escapism, pure and simple. The general mass audience likes to suspend it's disbelief and imagine. Turning a mirror on them won't change them, nor will it make them feel in any way ashamed, because it's all make believe.Human nature is a funny game indeed, it's just a shame Mr Haneke wasn't around to interview the audience at the Coliseum.",Funny Games

Even movies with terrible effects or acting find a way to entertain in some way even if your laughing at it. This movie manages to have bad acting but not bad enough to be funny. The plot is bad but not comically so. When it first came out I watched it with a group of friends. About 10 or so of us and one girl was disturbed by the movies violence the rest of us only reacted when time got reversed and we all laughed at the stupidity of the ""point"" that was being made.

This movie transcended ""slow start"". It even ended slow. The ending credits moved slower than normal credits do. It literally made me wish i was back on the streets of Baghdad. I value every second that Im home from Iraq, and I feel cheated by having watched this movie.

One that I think the writer and producers don't fully understand. If this movie contains any useful subtext, it is the futility of pacifism in the face of those bent on violence and trying to negotiate with evil.The movie was full of plot holes and the ending unfulfilling and pointless. It is stunning to me that they could raise the money to make this movie. Did anybody read the script? Why was Naomi Watts drawn to this project?

But, as anyone who has ever studied film for more than 5 minutes will realise, this is not SUPPOSED to be a regular horror / thriller. With several nods to surrealist directors, and two lead actors (Watts/Roth) with a taste for something different, I never expected this movie to be your run-of-the-mill nail biter.In fact, I found the performances very believable and the timing of the events to be spot-on. If you like something a bit different, then watch this. I admit, it is NOT perfect, however, the unjustified criticism of Haneke and, (yes some people are this sad) refusal to buy/rent another movie by the talented director, i find simply pathetic.

The direction was terrible, the cinematography atrocious, and the characters (besides the two psychopaths) horribly stupid. I found myself at times staring for a few minutes at the front of a house at night for no apparent reason. I actually watched a scene where the camera was pointed at the back of someone using a phone and someone sitting on a chair in the other room, neither was in focus. I know there are bunch of people who would look at this as artistic I find it to be on par with work from amateur film students who forgo meaning, plot, and character development in favor of trying to come off as some snobby artistic film. I believe the story is actually good and would be better if not done by such a terrible director. The acting was excellent, especially by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet. I think writer/director Michael Haneke needs to stop trying to be so pretentiously artistic or please stop making films and putting us through such torture.

I have not seen the original but I thought that Funny Games US was one of the most original, thought provoking movies I have ever seen. There are two things that contribute to the quality of this film 1) The sheer talent of the acting and directing throughout. Watts and Pitt are tremendous throughout and the film is directed and edited in a way that makes the viewer feel like they are ""there"" alongside the actors.2) The themes that run throughout the film. Haneke wants the audience to think after they leave the cinema. There are a number of nuances and subtleties throughout the film which add to the depth of this movie. The film is satirical and ironic as it brings the audience in on the ""action"". Is the audience condoning this violence by being entertained by it?

419,acutezza,Why bad reviews for this movie can't win,3,23 March 2008,"One of the hardest parts about reviewing an 'art house' type movie is inherent in the genre's name: it's a lot like criticizing art. And if you've ever tried to criticize modern art, or almost any art, you're probably familiar with some brutal rebuttals and denials. The same is true for these 'art house' type movies. It's a lot easier to give the movie a good review and go, but bad reviews draw a lot more fire. This is harder for me as well, because I typically love these types of movies.But I did not enjoy this movie--and I don't mean in the general 'it didn't make me happy' sense. I mean it in the 'had little value, emotionally or artistically' sense. Depending on how you're looking at it, there were many ways in which the movie could have gained merit--you could look at the performance of the actors, the entertainment of the plot itself, the tension or suspense, the message or theme. It tried very hard, but I don't think that it was able to live up to any of its expectations.The most important aspect of this film when judging it is meant to be unconventional. It breaks film-making conventions and denies the audience's expectations over and over. For example, it breaks the fourth wall quite a few times--meant to be a punch in the gut for the audience as they are acknowledged as participants in the film. It denies the audience's expectation of gore by making almost all the violence occur off-screen, leaving only sound effects. Although the movie fulfills its aims in its unconventionality, what we are left with when all the conventions are broken is only the shell of a great movie. The over-the-top experience is gut-wrenching and terrifying, but that is the only real effect you are left with. The movie sucks one in by being unconventional, but the movie made a mistake in that it aimed to be unconventional without having a clear idea of what to do after convention was broken. The movie just seems to wander around, dragging a great premise through the dirt.Another criticism of the movie comes from the intentions of the movie's plot. This movie--and its director, based on his real-life comments on his purpose in remaking a film shot-for-shot--is, in a word, pretentious. Haneke himself states that ""It is a reaction to a certain American Cinema, its violence, its naïveté, the way it toys with human beings"" (The Village Voice). Already there lies pretentiousness in the idea of remaking your own movie only ten years after the original, with practically the only change being the language. Already you're assuming that Americans will actually watch your movie just because it's in English, and on top of that, you're assuming that the bourgeois depiction of the 'victims' would be more fitting in American theaters. Then, you're saying that the violence message is more fitting in American theaters. I'll go ahead and dissect why all this pretentiousness bears no redeeming fruit.First point: American cinema is more focused on and condoning of violence than other countries' cinema. This point is already rendered practically untestable by the fact that there is no movie industry in the world that is quite comparable to Hollywood. Most industries are much smaller, and even the most comparable industry in terms of size (Bollywood) is not a fair comparison due to drastically different genre and stylistic focus. The established industry of film in America has the negative side effects of allowing low-quality and low-standards movies to be produced and distributed on a massive scale, as long as it provides a hook to entice consumers. The amount of violence in Hollywood is highly overemphasized, and is inevitable in the industry due to its inevitable hook. Also, these movies do fairly well in other countries (in terms of box office), suggesting that it's not strictly an American issue.Second point: The bourgeois characteristic of the characters is more appropriate in American theaters. Although there are plenty of yuppies, brownnosers, and bourgeois in America, I think it's unfair to say the bourgeois appearances of the characters are more of an American feature than German, or French, or English, whatever developed country you like. It's a common human attribute, a longing to move up in life, and enjoying a higher standard of living--not something I agree with, but everyone's seen it in action. Both this point, and the previous one, simply show a narrow-minded judgment on the part of the director.And the most, MOST important point to why this film did nothing for me: The film delivers a message about violence, especially in regards to middle/upper-class culture. This movie said nothing of importance to me. If you want to find a message like this, look at Clockwork Orange. There is no denying that Clockwork Orange effectively conveys a message about violence and morality in the modern world. This movie was looking and looking to make a point about violence, something about how watching violence and indulging in violent movies is akin to the violence itself. It got halfway there in that it drew the audience into the experience and almost created a sense of guilt. But it was unable to go much further. It did not even justify a nihilistic view, because the way in which the movie was made, especially the semi-surrealism of the actual events and the 'rewind' feature, at least reveals intent in creating a point. It circles round and round and ends up no where at all.I would call this movie avant-garde if it actually made any impact on me. A film can seek to chase beauty, tell a story, delight viewers, convey a message, play on a theme, or invoke an emotion, but when a film does none of these it loses its value as a piece of art. And this is exactly where Funny Games ends up.",Funny Games
420,brainstorm313,"Come on Mr. Haneke, tell us what your real motives are",1,25 March 2008,"I will write this review in a letter format to the film maker Michael Haneke. I hope you enjoy the review, because my review has more imagination then Funny Games.Dear Michael, I was never insulted during a movie in my life. At this point I would like to congratulate you because you're the first one. CONGRATULATIONS!!! I have to say (even thought it may sound blunt, bleak and violent) that the content of ""Funny Games"" is just as fake as the name you chose for the movie. You did a great job of promoting the ""anti"" in anti-Hollywood; though, I would rather say anti-media, 'period' (it's difficult for me to believe that a recognized movie theater would chose to play a movie like yours.) Unfortunately, I have to go as far as to say that you could learn a thing or two from Hesiod's ""Theogony."" ""Funny Games"" lacks substance, life, and struggle for survival. Everything in the movie seems to go exactly as you and only you want it to go while you abolish any understanding for basic human instinct and power. You have stripped your characters off reaction. You created a universe without a clock (even though you make time seem important in the movie), without a hero and without a concept for society. Please don't find me disagreeable with your ideas I simply like to think that a young couple with a little boy can come up with a solution to overpower your (fake) psychotic college students. I felt annoyed through-out the movie, because there were simply too many holes. You make it seem like the politeness has the power to demolish the principle of a particular situation (since the principle has the power to overcome obstacles you created on purpose.) At the same time you make your victims experience a communication breakdown for no apparent reason. Even though the actors who were the victims did a great job acting, I felt like you robbed the characters of their individualism. I would like to end this review on a friendly note. I believe you can do better then ""Komische Spiele"" in order to demonstrate your film making greatness. There were a couple of great synonyms with reality (i.e. I couldn't stop thinking about how the U.S. soldiers are torturing innocent people in Iraq to satisfy the need of their politicians for ""a new international reality"" (quote from The Toronto Star) while watching your movie) Auf nie wiedersehen, Dan Toronto, March 25, 2008",Funny Games

I also don't think we can comment on such production from a theatrical or acting point of view. Simply because this particular film along with the actors are mere puppets for the underlying pure evil - if we may say - that dictates every movement, every facial expression, every blink of the eye. And actors, don't get me wrong, do a very good job, just to point out that, in fact, they have no clue of what they participate in. They truly believe, and you can actually see it, that they are there to make a posh anti violence statement. They try extremely hard. I'm not talking about evil from a religious point of view. Its no need to as even an atheist might find himself in the aqward situation of asking himself ""where can something like this come from?"" Evil, whatever that may be, is the leading role, it's an almost tangible presence as the main question for any viewer would be who's behind all this. The obvious lack of reasons don't do anything but indicate to another origin that transcends logic. Because evil has no logic whatsoever, its just the way it is.------------- spoilers---------------------- If I were however to talk about Evil from a religious point of view, very few people mentioned the prayer scene which indeed was one of the darkest representations of Evil. Nobody knows any prayers, nobody believe they work. And than this fact is put to the test there and then and guess what, nothing happens indeed. Victory on all fronts. If they would've pictured the devil laughing in the corner and clapping, I wouldn't have been a bit surprised. The mocking cliché was way to obvious. ------------end of spoilers---------------Exploring evil, whatever that is to the point of identifying with it, portraying its madness and horror to very subtle details makes this movie an identity card for evil. Now you know who I am and what I am and you kinda liked it, didn't ya? In this movie evil is communicating directly with the audience, is engaging it in the conversation. All in a very polite, insidious way. Michael Pitt is smiling at you. He knows you'll stay in that chair 'til the last minute, even enjoy it.

He discovers he can walk only after the wife is gone. He doesn't really do anything to defend his family, almost showing implicit complicity/sympathy/understanding for the two young men. To tell you the truth, being a father, being (lower) middle-class in North America, my blood went boiling and running really fast while witnessing the first reactions of the character played by Tim Roth. No man in his condition would have let this charade go beyond the first chapter. Knowing Europeans/Mediterraneans quite well, knowing what they really think about North American society, I'm not surprised at seeing this remake now, which - not surprisingly - happens at one moment in history where the U.S.A. and its citizens are treated with most disrespect outside of this Continent. That movie couldn't have happened under Clinton administration, when some respect was prevailing toward Yankee country. Oh! Let me think again... It reminds me, the original version, the ""not yet a copy"" German flick that no-one have seen (despite all the hypocrites claiming here they've seen it before) was really a totally ""foreign to the U.S."" project. No producer here would have put a dime on this movie ten years ago.That being said, I have to admit that I'm taking this all too personal, on purpose. Despite everything I've wrote here, despite the fact that I'm seeing this as a big slap in the face, I do feel this was, cinematically speaking, a great moment. I'm giving a 8 out of 10.

428,xtr_trek,So bad I had to register with IMDb and post this... 7.0???????!!!??,1,22 April 2008,"I generally use the IMDb score to judge if a movie is worth watching. After seeing the relatively high score on this one, I thought I would give it a go. This film has left me questioning the integrity of the rating system... How several thousand people could give this movie a rating higher than 1 I have no idea. It started off decent. The death metal over the opera music was very clever. But as soon as the eggs dropped, the whole thing just went to hell. There were just so many things that the parents did that were just absolutely retarded. As soon as I heard my dog get clubbed in the face, I would at the very least go investigate. Why didn't the wife go outside and get her husband right away when these 2 strangers keep walking in and out of their house? Why does a rich family have only one phone? How can you sit there and be threatened with death and do absolutely nothing about it? How do two boys with one golf club between them, who are clearly stupid as ****, manage to pull this off? Well I guess it's because the family was absolutely retarded... but is anyone out there that stupid? Why does a mother whose kid is being held hostage 200 feet away not ask for help when a boat full of people show up at their dock? I mean, women or not, I would gladly try my chances at a 4 on 1 to save my child. Maybe push the guy off the dock and bash him with something when he tries to climb out?? I don't know, just an idea that happened to pop into my head about .1 seconds after seeing a freaking BOAT FULL OF PEOPLE SHOW UP. I would have said that the kid was the smartest person in the whole film, for at least trying to do *something*, but of course he just runs next door and ""hides"" in a LIVING ROOM.The next point I would like to make is that what the hell can anyone possibly find entertaining about 2 guys coming into a house, hanging out for a couple hours, blasting a kid with a shotgun in front of his parents, and then leaving? Just plain sick. Maybe had the kid gotten away safe and the parents both got blasted, I would have enjoyed this at least marginally... watching two idiots get killed is better than an innocent kid I suppose.After reading some of the threads in the message board about this movie, I see the most common post being ""Yeah well the director meant it to be that way."" Well thats like going to McDonalds and getting a piece of dog s**t on a bun and having them say ""yeah, its supposed to taste like that"" I mean come on... Do people really make s**tty movies on purpose?? I realize that there is no arguing with the people that stand up for the piece of s***t, but I at least had to put in my vote of 1/10 to lower the score a bit for unsuspecting IMDb'ers that are looking for a good scoring movie to watch.Terrible.",Funny Games

The whole movie actually kind of giving me the idea that it's such a low budget movie. I mean, it's a story about killing the victims, abuse them, etc, so it's just normal that we expect to see some disturbing scenes with a lot of blood. But then, surprise surprise, they didn't even show the killing scene.. not even the abusing part.. It was just noises then suddenly bodies lying around. Oh well, kind of giving the idea that they won't use any special effects. More on the details: all the victims are extremely unreasonable. The ""accidents"" happened are so unreal.

The acting is great, especially by Naomi Watts, but there is definitely something wrong...There is no plot, except what we already know before watching the movie and the only «surprise» is the psychological violence added throughout the film...

And just plain out stupid. This movie was a huge let down from Naomi Watts' previous movies such as the ring, and darkness falls. This movie dragged out way to much. For instance the almost five minutes of watching nothing happen after the kid was shot. I was expecting to see more of a fight put up by the family, but the only one who seem to show any resistance towards them was the little boy. The family was ignorant in the fact that when the ""Ann"" was trying to get the phone to work she should have either A) ran away to get help instead of waiting so long or B) gotten as many knives and other weapons to use against them.

The only good thing I can say about this flick is that the acting (besides the son) was very well done.

The story depicts a white middle class family who find themselves at the mercy of two young men. Although sometimes painful to watch, the film is ultimately about the relationship between the filmmaker and his audience. Like the helpless victims trapped inside their house, we the audience find ourselves at the mercy of the films director - who plays ruthlessly with our emotions. Tormented, fearful and yet always retaining some possible hope, the director refuses to allow us to compromise his idea of what cinema should be. From the opening moments, to the cunning and revealing climax, we the audience become victim to the directors own funny games. Its a film which forces us to question the bizarre and often painful relationship we have with cinema. The original was so well crafted Its hardly surprising the Director made this English Language version an exact replica of his original.

What you see in the previews makes the movie to be something that it is not. I thought the acting was horrid. You never seen any action at all. To emphasize a scene, you do not need to focus on one object for over a minute, nor do you need to have the only exciting portion of the movie to be ""rewinded"" by the bad guy so he can do it over again. POOR POOR POOR movie. I strongly discourage anyone from watching it. I disliked it that much that I actually registered just to voice my opinion on this one movie. Naomi Watts did a good job acting I will put that in for a pro, besides that, everything else was a let down. When the suspicion rose against the bad guys.... it was drawn out way to long before something was done. As quoted from the back of the movie ""an ever-tightening sense of suspense balanced on a knife's edge between icy fear and shocking surprise."" They left out that it was icy due to the lack of suspense and the surprise is just that you wasted that much time watching something of this poor quality. ""Brutal games"".... apparently a sheltered life that has not seen any other movies that have brutality i.e. Saw's 1,2,3,4 Saving Private Ryan, 300, etc. etc. etc. Simplistic blast from a shotgun that you only hear and do not even see due to the focus being only on a Nascar Race on the television in the same room. Big deal. I hope that this poor, obviously low budget movie is pulled from the shelves in hopes that it will not pollute the decent ""B"" rated movies on the market. completely and utterly disappointed with this film.

I suggest you watch another movie and save your money on this one. Although everything in the movie could really happen in life, there are so many scenes where you ask yourself why the character doesn't do this instead of that, like for instance when the little boy escapes from the house and finds shelter in the neighbor's's empty mansion. What the hell..why is he hiding there? Why doesn't he just run outside in the street to find help.

If there was the option to score this review 0/10 I would have, I feel deeply sorry for those actors and crew who had to attribute this film to their working CV's, as it has made me question their judgement.

For example, movies like Independence Day have a decent ending where the audience is happy about what they saw. In this movie, the beginning is very intriguing, but the rest of the movie is very flat. You just don't get any excitement from it. Just not my cup of tea.Although the movie reminds you some critical points that you shouldn't forget if it happens in real life.1. Growing up in Russia, one rule that I been taught since diapers is that not to let strangers inside the house. If someone knocks on my door and asks me for eggs, I am going to lock and bolt the door and tell them ""No"" 2. When the two guys were in the house and they didn't want to leave, she should ran outside and tell her husband about the intruders in the house.

450,peterjack12,Superb thriller for those who like something different,10,19 January 2009,"This thriller has I feel been rather 'overanalyzed' by many reviewers. This may put off many people, who may think this is an 'art-house film' . The great thing about this film is the way it breaks away from all the clichés that make so many American films predictable and boring. I have listed the most obvious examples below.The two psychopaths who terrorise this well-off family are rather anaemic, well spoken, well-educated young men who look faintly ridiculous in their white shorts and tops. Yet from the outset there is something strange, unsettling, and irritating about their apparently innocently inept behaviour.Another refreshingly original point about this film is the complete absence of background mood music or the overused 'radio static' noise which every producer feels obliged to use. The creepy use of absolute silence was used to great effect in this film.It was only after the film was over, that I realised that; what had seemed to be an extremely harrowing violent movie actually had hardly any real portrayals of violence! Nearly all the violence happened out of shot. What was perhaps the most distressing aspect of this movie was that chances of escape for the hapless family were constantly dangled in front of us, but all these hopes were constantly, cruelly dashed. A reflection on the cruelty of real life.Movie producers all seem to think that constant fast pace is always essential, but this film made use of long lingering scenes, such as the woman's long, unbearable struggle to stand up with her hands and feet tied together. I could feel her intense frustration.The movie also made me realise that, faced with the same circumstances, most people would probably actually behave in the same pathetic, helpless way that this family did: their irritating lack of common sense and inability to cope with a situation that was so far removed from their own safe way of life.A harrowing film that was sometimes difficult to watch.",Funny Games

But, to my disappointment, the film ended and was practically at the same point that it was in the beginning. My main complaints is that there was no apparent motive for what the two home invaders were doing. There was no indication of where they came from, or where they were headed. I felt that I wasted my two hours and that I wish I could have them back.

I don't know why I love him so much,(possibly from loving 'the dreamers') but he always captures me with his soft spoken nature and the way he seems to hang on to every word he speaks. Anyways, back to the movie. I don't like really reviewing movies for their plot or characters or anything about the movie itself because honestly I feel everyone will see something different, and people have prejudices based off what actors they like or dislike or the way they portrayed such and such character. Also, why does everyone need to bitch and moan about remakes? Honestly I think who cares if it's a remake or not a remake. A good movie is a good movie. And Funny Games is that, a good movie. It captured my interest, and I loved the realism of it. Well, realism if you're a woman and married and your husband is kind of a bitch, but realistic enough. But, I didn't really care about any of that at all. I was rooting for those 2 boys the whole way through.Just praying that every minute would make that family suffer more and more.

It was by far the worst movie I have ever saw. I would not suggest for anyone to waste their time to watch this movie. I wish I could get the time back for the minutes I wasted watching this movie. The movie was just plain stupid. All it was was two kids torturing a family of three. They shoot a boy, shoot the husband then bind the women and dump her in a river. There was nothing to this movie. I could write a better movie than this.I hope this deters people from watching this movie. If you were wondering why I kept rambling on about this movie is because it had to be at least 10 lines long so others could read it.",Funny Games
458,nbanets23,Funny Games,10,23 April 2009,This movie is filled with complex ideals that most first time viewers cannot comprehend. The entire movie is based on the idea that their are two universes or dimensions and that one is reality and the other is fiction. The murderers however are the fine line between reality and fiction which is why they have ultimate power. The film unleashes this idea during the boat scene at the end. This movie is not just a basic horror movie. It is conceptual and is bigger than what the common audience makes it. although funny games is a remake the director does a better job at providing an explanation for the actions of Peter and Paul.,Funny Games

It is without a doubt the worst piece of garbage I have ever wasted my time on. I want my two hours back. One viewer actually referred to this film as artsy... yeah right! The eight minute scene of Anne trying to escape from the duct tape was anything but artsy. It was ridiculous. It was slow, boring, and did not reflect the true emotions of a mother who just lost her son. The characters in this film were, across-the-board, emotionless. If this is the future of the movie industry, count us out!!! The truth of the matter is, someone with a very limited exposure to the world created this piece of crap according to their narrow-minded view. In a nutshell, this movie sucked! The fact that they killed the little boy just made the film all the uglier, not more interesting or artsy, as has been suggested.This movie makes the movie ""natural born killers"" seem like a quality film.If there was an option to give a rating of this film below one, my rating would be very much a negative number.

Sure there were things I didn't expect, like the son being shot. But there was nothing much in the movie that did anything for me. I am not a fan of movies like Hostel, Saw, or anything of that sort. I find them boring and pointless. The only thing that made me like the film at all was how the two young dudes acted toward the violence they made. It was amusing.Apparently I was supposed to take away some sort of feelings or thoughts about violence in cinema. Really? I must have missed most of that. I didn't watch this movie for some hidden (or supposed obvious) social and/or political statements. I knew nothing of this movie. And while it amused me enough to watch it through.

463,michal-adamkowski,Intellectual masturbation?,3,15 November 2009,"All I care for is the answer to the following question:Does this movie lave you with any new usable thought or it is just another ""modern art like"" shallow and pointless intellectual masturbation?I may understand the need of the director to face his own demons and struggle with them through movie making. I hope he is defeating them and not being defeated. It is ether his therapy or orgy. In both cases I would be pleased to stay out of it.The concept of the movie is based on a simple mechanism of pushing boundaries that is as primitive as there can be.Why the wife was not raped? Too much to show? Why... For some viewers it could be the cherry on the top, for others just a starter! What about the kid? Oops! Forgot about the dead dog... It is just all rubbish. If Haneke has some higher goal going this ""shocking"" path why doesn't he go all the way instead of only flirting with such ideas for publicity. If you want to play with fire be prepared to get burned or you are just playing stupid and being hypocrite.Unfortunately the deal is simple: it has to be shocking but within mainstream boundaries so we can show it in the movie theaters - shocking within the boundaries - ha ha - what an oxymoron.If there is a poison, you don't need to drink it to know how deadly it is. The movie generates pointless, artificial emotions that we all are aware of but I don't see any reason why we should be gradually manipulated into feeling them for ourselves.What is the point? Because probably there is a savage, sadistic, perverted psychopath in every one of us - a post-modernist would say.

464,fluffys_roam_free,The worst movie I have ever seen.,1,17 July 2010,"This review is long, so just let me start with saying this: If you want to see a good movie of a similar nature, I mean, taken hostage in a house/terrorized by crazy people movie, try 'The Strangers', or 'Them'. Both are along the same lines and are actually decent and worth watching.In all seriousness, this movie was terrible. Out of the hundreds of films I've watched over the years, this is definitely the worst one. No jokes. I watched it on a recommendation, and I truly regret it. It was beyond boring. To begin with, there was absolutely no character depth. Character depth isn't always necessary, but there's normally something more to compensate that, but in this film I couldn't have cared less if that family survived this ordeal or not. It all started to fail in a scene quite near the start at the dock, where Ann didn't attempt to ask for help from her neighbors who were possibly the last people she would see again, how she just completely failed to mention that the man standing next to her was a raving lunatic who had just broken her husband's leg with a golf club and killed her dog with aforementioned golf club. Instead she just said 'Maybe we'll come by later'. Maybe?! Not 'My phone's on the fritz and my husband could use an ambulance' if she wanted to be subtle. I began to despise the sheer idiocy of this woman. It doesn't stop here, but I won't make this review longer than it needs to be.I constantly analyze scenes like this, the 'What would I do?' automatic thought, which I know everybody does (if not most people), but for me too many of these moments can make the movie good or bad. Unintelligent decisions like this are what make most movies unrealistic. I lose empathy for characters that make stupid decisions that will ultimately contribute to their demise. I have read other reviews on this movie, and I understand that the movie wasn't intended to be realistic in some senses, one of the killers rewound the movie at one point, which is fine with me, I enjoy surrealism and bizarre stuff, but it seemed like the family were scared for their lives, or scared of the situation but really didn't care about the outcome and had no desire to try to alter it. Had they no survival instincts? No parental instincts for the safety of their son? It's as if these people weren't real people in a sense. All they did was cry about it. If I knew my life was at stake, a fight to the death would commence, and I'm positive that for almost everyone they would at least make some kind of effort to survive.Tim Roth's character wouldn't be missed if he wasn't there. He had about 10 lines at most, and he just irritated me because he was such a blatant coward from the very beginning. What kind of man slaps another man? Seriously? Roughly drag him towards the door and shove him out, yeah. Fisticuffs, even would have been fantastic. Make some kind of vague attempt to retaliate when you notice that you're about to be hit with a golf club. This isn't how men react to conflict and threats to their lives. Nobody becomes that passive when having their life threatened.No land line phones? Come on. It's strange enough that the family didn't have one, but the neighbors didn't either? And only one cell phone for the whole family! These people were mentally challenged, if nothing else.I haven't mentioned everything I hate about this film, of course, because I'd be here for hours.I could have let some of these things go, but I can't forget about them all. All these little things that irritated me throughout the film just built up and made me despise it.It's not that I can't deal with art house or surrealist cinema, it's not that I can't deal with anything out of the ordinary, it's that I can't deal with watching idiotic characters with no will to live make awful decisions and cry on my TV screen for almost two hours. I can appreciate and enjoy things that don't make sense, because things don't have to make sense to be enjoyed, but really, this one had all the flaws of a cheesy low budget horror movie, but none of the charm.",Funny Games

Yes, they would write how the many interminable action-less scenes allowed the viewer the chance to let their imaginations work, to become more interactive with what they were seeing. I knew there would be reviewers that were blown away by the use of a television remote control to unwind the wife's attempt to stand up for herself by shooting one of her captors. ""It was an indictment of the typical arc of the Hollywood terror movie!"", they would write. In reality, this movie is the blank canvass hanging in your art museum. There are those who impute genius to such a bold work,(most likely not because they believe it, but rather because they think they should). They will give this movie a rating of over 5, (probably more-self- delusion is rarely half-hearted). Most people though, will probably be offended. No-not because the director wanted them to be offended-but because people are rightly indignant at spending valuable life minutes on irredeemable garbage. So don't be fooled.

I saw the original version a few years back and found it to be an entertaining and captivating movie. The American remake of this movie is identical (with a few updates for technology), and English speaking actors. I think the problem with ""thriller"" and ""horror"" movies these days is that we're so accustomed to the shock and gore that a psychological thriller is lost on most people. I think the experience of really putting yourself in the character's shoes is what really makes a movie, and this is what this movie delivers. If you found your ultimate moment of joy from watching Jason Vorhees take out a couple of campers you've never seen before while having sex, this isn't going to be the movie for you. This is an exercise in how people behave in an unexpected, awful and shocking situation. This is how real people react when but into a crazy situation. This isn't running and screaming deeper into the woods pursued by a madman. This movie delivers stress and chills, which is what horror truly is. There is no happy ending, there is no hero.

There are quite a few scene that seem like they should end in 5 seconds, but instead drag on for like 5 minutes. Easy example is after the son dies and the woman is trying to untie herself. It takes 1 minute in that scene for her to start moving, and then another minute for her to get to the TV stand and then 3 minutes to try and break the tape from her wrists. I understand that there is emotions involved, but that is no excuse for this much wasting of time.Additionally, because I was watching this from a DVD and not in theaters, I found myself yelling at the situation, and the parents and the son could have done so much stuff different and it was obvious stuff. But the one scene, the ONE SCENE, that I actually cheered out loud for, there was the stupid concept of the remote and he just REWOUND it. Really? REALLY?

474,rdeacon,Thoughts about Funny Games,8,11 August 2008,"1. It wasn't a violent film. Many Comments call it ""violent"". How much violence did we really see? Sure, much violence is implied, but very little is shown. In fact, the most violent image - Ann shooting Peter - was used in the film in a dream sequence-style extension that ends up outside the timeline of the actual events. Other violent images are mostly limited to barely-violent shoving. All the violence is off-screen, which is why the sub-label ""torture porn"" cannot be used to describe this film (many comments suggest otherwise). This film is ANYTHING BUT torture porn, because it shows you nothing. Just about every violent action is implied rather than shown. Even the sex is implied - despite a scene in which a lesser director would have done full-frontal nudity (of which Naomi Watts is not unaccustomed), Haneke keeps it PG - shooting entirely from the shoulders up. He does this for a reason. What was violent about this film was its attitude. The fear it generated in us by using surprisingly few plot devices - the plot is played total straight. In fact, the torture the family undergoes never occurs in any physical way, implied or otherwise. Sure, they are killed, but the killings are fast (relatively, Mr. Roth). Other than the occasional shove the villains are models of civility. The great intended irony is that Haneke sold the movie as something that would show everything, bathing us in rape and slow, excruciating physical torture. He's like Kubrick during the marketing of Eyes Wide Shut, who sold it as a sex-glorifying thriller when in reality it criticized the glorification of sex in film. I find it humorous and deserving of respect.2. The acting was amazing. Some Comments pooh pooh the acting in this film, but everyone, especially Roth, Watts, and Gearhart, had a physically demanding role. In one scene, Watts is bound, in her underwear, trying to hop across the room in which her son was just shot dead and her husband lies unconscious. The scene is excruciatingly slow (for a reason) and there's only one camera shot for a solid few minutes during which she has to perform this complex series of physical stunts, all while staying in character as a woman whose only child was killed not a minute earlier. And Roth's depiction of a broken leg was pretty damn good.3. I like the casting of Roth against type. I think it adds to the film's loosely-defined message of criticizing our glorification of ultra-violence in American film. Roth is usually cast in a villainous or somehow morally twisted role, so the use of him as a sympathetic character only set the bar higher, and IMHO Roth did an amazing job.4. The film's weak moment was after the killing, when the villains faux flee the scene. They give the family far too much leverage if the plan was to reacquire them. Ann ended up on a major road, but she could have done a lot of things that might have resulted in her escape. While Georgie's brief escape was thwarted in a reasonable manner, Ann's escape was a ended by sheer luck on the part of the villains. However the shot of the golf ball and George was SWEET.5. I love the 15 minutes following the killing. From Ann's attempt to cross the living room to their conversation in the front hall, that entire sequence was brutally slow, totally realistic, and amazingly shot and acted. It was as gritty as it comes, and their depiction of a couple simultaneously grieving their son's death while working to stay alive is simply awesome.6. This movie is not entertaining - and THATS A GOOD THING. I left this movie feeling uncomfortable, not entertained. But I also knew, by the end of the film, that the point wasn't to mindlessly entertain - there was an enlightening aspect to it that persisted after the film ended. I saw it 24 hours ago and not a waking hours has passed that I have not thought about that film for at least five minutes.7. I loved the trailer too. It channeled pure Kubrick with the list of textual adjectives interspaced between brief snippits of well-shot action with a classical music score.",Funny Games
475,Razz_ab1,I watched a gate close,1,2 November 2011,"If you asked me to pick out the very best movie I had ever watched, I would have a hard time of it. I've seen many good, great, and amazing movies in my time. Suffice it to say, that after I told my choice, if you even hinted towards replying that Funny Games was YOUR favorite movie, I would declare you to be the most ignorant, tasteless, moronic being ever to have existed within the known universe.This movie has no part of it whatsoever that is not horribly drawn out (seemingly to lengthen it, as though that were a good thing)or that is not completely and utterly baffling. What could I possibly mean by that? I mean simply this: I watched a gate close. Why? Is there some hidden symbolism my feeble mind was unable to grasp? I think not. I think that this director has the wildest imagination in the world, with a suspension of disbelief unheard of in the real world. It is LITERALLY impossible for anyone to watch this movie and say to themselves, ""This is quality film-making. I could see no way for this movie to be improved, nor any reason why it should be collected and ritualistically burned to a heap of molten plastic slag.""I'm here to tell you something. This movie most definitely should be thrown into a volcano, because I can see no reason for any rational person to be tortured in such a merciless way, as being fed this fodder through their eyes. If ever I was to meet Michael Haneke(the director) I would most assuredly slap his face until which point my bewilderment and disgust left my body through my hand. Which I can only assume would take several years.Now that I have that out of my system, I can tell you why it is that I find this movie so abhorrent. It is not because of it's content, but rather, in it's severe lack thereof.First, the main family is entirely unlikable. You are given no time to bond with them whatsoever, and there fore they are effectively worthless in evoking any emotion from their situation. (SPOILER)So when their child is killed, you feel no severed connection whatsoever. He died, and not only does the family seem relatively unaffected(considering the fact that they just lost their SON, not just they're super-annoying dog), but Naomi Watts' character, who is tied up, goes over and turns off the TV instead of mourning her son as best she could. Clearly the boy was replaceable. I certainly got that feeling.(end spoiler). The thing about them that is most disagreeable, is that they're all incredibly dense. Not a moment goes by that you will watch this movie and not say to yourself that this could literally never happen in the real world. It's honestly impossible.Next, regardless of the big name actors/actresses in this movie(which ranges from A-D list), every person's lines feel forced and wholly unnatural, as though they'd not only never acted a day in their lives, but also had only recently been given the script, and indeed had only just met. The best performance was from Tim Roth(who even said he'd never watch this terrible movie, go figure) simply because he had the fewest lines. So his character wasn't ruined by the awkward(not at all creepy) vibe that you got from every single character by the mere miracle that he didn't say enough.Finally, the clincher. The long drawn out scenes of little to no movement whatsoever, often from far off. What can I possibly be referring to? Again, I watched a gate close. No one was around it, at all. Often, I could barely see what was going on, and even when I could, the sheer awkwardness of most of their actions broke my suspension of disbelief, rendering them pointless and impossible to relate to.To close, I'd say to stay far away from this movie. It doesn't even reach the point of ""so bad, it's good"". This movie is so bad, it rounds the scale about 8 times and settles down on ""an absolute disgrace to the existence of higher brain function.""",Funny Games

Not even the greatest of movie serial killers get to have that, but these little snotty morons with no semblance of how human beings interact DO?! And I don't mean that they're inhuman in a way that they're creepy AT ALL, because they're not. This wasn't scary. The scenario was nonsensical in that they had only one phone, the family had plenty of opportunities to strike back yet they didn't, all around it was a mess.

SERIOUSLY, AND THEN WHEN HE SAID ""YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO BREAK THE RULES?!"" THIS MOVIE BREAKS THE RULES!

It is not so much real life because in real life when people are put in such situations their survival instincts enable them do things they normally aren't capable of. That survival instinct and the chemicals the body secretes when the internal panic button is pushed is programmed into us genetically. That's real.Acting was good but I didn't like the direction so much. Also, without spoiling the plot I'll just say there were many opportunities available to better the situation that weren't taken. Also there were opportunities that would've realistically been available that were not available in the film. Again, not so believable.I agree with the critics, not so good or interesting.

479,Mrlgt,A collection of old tricks and new ones that don't work,4,26 April 2012,"Firstly let us say that the movie was well made and the production value was never an issue. The plot does not offend any more than it tries to, and that this style of film making has a place in the consumer market, which should not alarm.The pacing is well crafted. Yes, it is very slow, suffer-ably so which is the point. The viewer is almost forced to catch every detail. But this is nothing new. Films like High Tension (2003) amongst others use it to better effect.The shocking nature of the film or rather the intended shock value was present but the actual depiction of violence is absent. Another technique that has been used many times and often better.It is not that every movie should use or create new techniques as that is an impossibility, however if a film is to rely solely on these techniques it would be best to do so in a less predictable manner and executed with some craftsmanship.Then there is the scene where the evil duo lose control of the situation only to have the main antagonist use a seemingly random television remote control to rewind real life there by defeating the hero and heroin upon a second attempt. This removes any hope this viewer may have had in the protagonists survival. It also removes the viewer from the moment. This occurs right when the viewer thinks an major plot shift might finally take place.The ""rewind"" is never explained and only hinted at in a conversation between the two antagonists in disjointed conversation and adds nothing to the film.If you, as a movie enthusiast, enjoy tension, oddity, and emotional suffering depicted in great detail then you may enjoy this movie.",Funny Games

Also, even though this review looks rather long I would plead that you save yourself time and frustration by reading it. That being said:Funny Games is diabolically sinister!

Let me clarify!The movie, Funny Games, is diabolically sinister for anyone who is unfortunate enough to watch it. The plot might be as well, if there were one in sight. This abortion of a movie would have been dark and eerie if not for that fact that you spend the entire movie wishing that ANYTHING would happen.No other movie has kept me guessing quite like Funny Games. I was constantly wondering: ""Will the movie ever improve? Will the movie ever actually GET GOOD?! Is it even worth watching to the very end?!"" The answer to all of those questions is the same. HELL NO!A roller-coaster ride of peril? Sounds exciting! Doesn't it though? Yes, and that's all part of the Deluxe Disappointment Package that Michael Haneke devoted himself to making for the world. Imagine walking up to the most grand and intimidating roller-coaster you have ever laid your eyes on. You become pleasantly optimistic. You are the first person seated and you patiently wait for everyone else to pile in so that the ride may commence. That's about the first 30 minutes of the movie. ""It's taking awhile to seat everybody,"" you say to yourself. Your anticipation keeps you confident though. The ride finally starts rolling forward. The squeaking of the wheels pierces the air as your blood slowly begins to pump. It lurches forward and begins to pick up speed. ""Finally, it was worth it."" But as you are thinking, the roller-coaster screeches to a halt causing you to slam your nose against the front of your cart and break it. ""WTF?!"" At this point, blood gushing down your face, you want nothing more than to get off the ride. Unfortunately, you MUST know if it is worth all the torturous stupidity that you have already endured. That describes the next half hour or so of the movie. The roller-coaster ascends mind numbingly slow towards the peak. You keep telling yourself that once you reach the top everything will pay off, but your confidence has turned into pathetic hopefulness. After over an hour of mind numbing nothingness you are inches from the top. By this point you have convinced yourself that nothing can make up for what you have already endured. However, you might as well see if something exciting happens, so you toss your hands up and get ready to scream. And then......... Pssssht. (My interpretation of the sound of brakes) ""Hope you enjoyed the ride folks. Have a nice day!"" Close your eyes and try and fathom the frustration that you would be feeling at this moment. Now open your eyes (hehehe) and look at your TV. That's the credits rolling. And the frustration is equally vain-popping.I read many reviews to try and understand how it was so well rated. I came to the conclusion that 90% of the people defending it argued that it was unconventionally brilliant art. They claim that it dared to go outside the box of fundamental movie making! This is true. It did! Unfortunately, Haneke failed to realize that the box he was abandoning was floating in shark infested waters. A little extreme you might think? Hmmm. NO! I would go on to say that the sharks in the water are numerous, massive, and starving. At this point you might be thinking that I'm over-exaggerating to the extent that I sound foolish. To those that think that I would like to finalize my metaphor by adding that Haneke slit both his wrists before jumping in the water.If I were given the fictional VHS tape that killed people in The Ring and a copy of Funny Games then my reaction would be instant. I would burn Funny Games immediately. I would then proceed to watch the VHS tape from The Ring repeatedly until the creepy little girl came out of the TV and killed me. Thereby saving from the miserable, grief stricken, and depression filled abyss that watching Funny Games sent me spiraling down.When the movie ended the first thing I said to the friend beside me was ""should we be mad at the director or writer?"" Upon further investigation I found out that they were one in the same. That's when it started to make sense. If someone directs their own script then I foresee two possibilities. 1) A genius directs a mind blowing masterpiece that shakes the foundation of brilliant and forever remains in the minds of its viewers. 2) You suck and nobody wants to direct your movies, or let you direct theirs.Haneke has directed about 20 of the movies he wrote himself. So which is he? Of all his movies Funny Games was the only one he re-made. That leads me to believe that he might have considered this one of his greatest works. Now, how many people you know have even heard of Funny Games? Practically nobody, right? Do the math! Save yourself!",Funny Games

Other highlights included 20 second outdoor sequences where again nothing happened in the entire ""scene"" and another bit where Tim Roth's character is sat on the floor crying, so I went and made myself a glass of coke with ice and a slice of lemon and got back to see - you guessed it - the same scene! My friend assured me there were no scenes between.If that wasn't enough, it's one of those movies that leaves you tearing your hair out at the family's irrational decisions, even allowing for the stress they would presumably be under.Coming second in ""massively pointless and annoying parts of this movie"" are the two scenes where the main evil one talks to the camera... why? I would understand if it was recurring theme of the movie, but those particularly bits feel disjointed and out of place.Finally, THE WORST scene in this movie is the bit where Ann shoots one of the evil ones and the other guy finds the remote control and actually rewinds the movie to prevent the shooting.

So I watched it tonight with my brother and my dad. From the posts that I read, the director was trying to make the viewer feel a deep aggravation,anguish at the end of the movie. Well Mission Accomplished for that, the aggravation worked on all three of us.Most people, when they watch a movie, they want to forget the headache,the stress, the madness of every days life, and embark on a journey in the movie with the actors . They sometimes feel the sadness, the happiness, the laughter and everything else thats in the movie . but at the end of a movie, there's always some kind of retaliation, or if not, some kind of logic that impresses the viewer,even if the ending ends badly.This movie didn't have that logic. It ended with the three of us just feeling like s***. This wasn't a movie for us to enjoy, It was one big test for the director to enjoy laughing at our faces. It was a complete turn around of all other similar movies that end with a retaliation. such an easy story that could have been made by anyone!Yet I give this movie a 4 out of 10, for great acting, realistic situations, and congrats for the director for accomplishing on making us feel like s*** at the end.",Funny Games

We are being attacked for being attracted to this type of violence. But what if we're not attracted to it? I often think that filmmakers become too elitist: they think we need to be educated.

There is acting here... high quality acting. But it cannot overcome a self indulgent, artificial story which has nothing to do with the ""reality"" it portrays. Is our society violent? Yes, but the violence in life is much more mundane than shown here and much less philosophical. It is generally faster and more impersonal. I could care less if the bad guy wins, in real life they often do. What really bothers me is the almost sympathetic view of the bad guy... that society created him and it is all of our fault.

I really did not feel it was that unconventional as I watched it. The film is a trap and torture psychological thriller. This genre has been ventured into many times. It builds up enough suspense that I was under the impression it could be watched and appreciated on the basis of its thriller element alone. However, I was wrong, most of those who watched it in this mind set seem to be disappointed with the film. To look at this film with more of an art house perspective may be more successful. I found this film to be incredibly self-aware and therefore fascinating. It presents acknowledgedly fictional characters. It keys into all the main points of the thriller genre. With a nod to the handful of backgrounds the killers are interchangeable given in the genre and to all the moments where the audience is willing certain things to unfold on screen. As for realism- what is the realism for this situation? I have not a clue. Nothing seemed more off about the reactions of the characters in this films than that in any sort of similar film.The film does drag at certain parts by willing interrupting what would be some of the main action points. The thriller elements have all been seen before but that may be the point; it is a dissection of the thriller genre and the audience of the thriller.

Basically, 2 young men terrorize a family for what seems to be for their own pleasures. That's the film. It might sound a bit intriguing, and a premise we have heard before, but it's the presentation (how the story is being told) that makes this its own unique thing.Leaving aside all the painful emotions I experienced while watching it, this film feels kind of like a slap in the face, because this film is more than just a painful experience. This film makes statements about violence and horror films in general. I'm not going to spoil the film, but there are moments in the film where Haneke tricks you so much to the point that you will be taken away by how a director can do something to his/her audience. Some will hate this choice, others might not.
Now, if you hate this film, then Haneke did his job very well, because you are not supposed to like it, and that's what separates this film from others. It's not just different for the sake of being different, but different with a purpose. Haneke is definitely saying something.
If you have no idea who Haneke is, then look him up. Haneke shows the darkest sides of humans in his films generally, and when violence is being shown on screen, it can not only be emotionally felt, but sometimes even physically. He makes a lot of statements indirectly in all of his films about people in general. His films make you think, and this one is no exception. He is a very clever director, and you should definitely check out his other films.The acting in this films is phenomenal. Both Roth's and Watts' acting abilities are being used to their full potential, and you really feel for them. The kid in the film was also pretty f##king fantastic. It is so rare to come across a genuinely great perfomance from a kid these days (every kid in Haneke's film is amazing btw). The cinematography is pretty good, the sound is great, the lack of music, the long takes, everything is just amazing. Really impressive how one can improve so much in remaking something they already made (Funny Games 1997, German Version).The next film you'll watch, where violence is shown, you can definitely see how some directors can sugarcoat their violence, and not being honest about something most of us do not want to participate in. ""Funny Games"" is definitely not for everyone that's for sure, but if you know what the film is going for, and you like different films/art-house films, then I'd recommend checking this one out.",Funny Games

501,BlueEyedNick,A twisted psychological thriller.,8,21 September 2016,"This was not the movie I had expected after having read the short synopsis here on IMDb. I had expected something more violent and less psychological. This does not mean I am in any way disappointed with the movie. Quite the contrary in fact. It surpassed all of my expectations by far. The mood gets creepy quite quickly. Already in the scene where Ann and George stop off to confirm the game of golf they have booked with their neighbours you get that strange feeling that something is very wrong. The way Fred looks over his shoulder, probably at his wife Eve before almost hesitantly confirming that the game is on.This of course leads to the scene with the eggs escalating into a budding psychological terror very fast, the clumsy, nervous yet persistent presence of Peter (or whatever his name actually is), in the kitchen, the hall way, even already when he is standing outside the door. All of which is of course part of the plan.The exaggerated politeness of the assailants is another aspect that adds to the creep factor of this psychological thriller. Combined with their apologetic and at the same time threatening way of talking to the family is simply chilling because that makes it perfectly clear that they completely lack any shred of empathy. The victims are only there for their entertainment.But where the movie really caught my full attention and rose above most movies in the genre of families being tormented and tortured by ""psychopaths"" was when Paul turned to the camera and addressed the viewer for the first time. It added a dimension of delusion and a complete lack in sense of reality.This delusion is then taken to yet another level in the remote control scene where Paul rewinds the movie so he can avoid Ann from reaching the gun and kill his partner. This made me wonder if the partner was real or just part of Paul's psychotic episode.At the end as they discuss the possibility of communication between reality and fiction that feeling grew stronger still.And of course the end of the movie solidify how outside the box this movie actually is, even though you kind of had a feeling it would end that way.It will be a while before I'll forget that deranged stare into the camera while the credits start. It is very similar to the stare of Norman Bates at the end of the original Psycho. The one thing that could have made that freeze frame even more chilling would be if Peter's face had been added on top of Paul's.I also feel that I must mention the excellent camera work and the long sequences such as the one in the living room after the assailants leave about half way through the movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Also the way the camera stayed focused on the central images of each scene rather than cutting back and forth like so many movies do. 8/10 might seem high but I must confess that I was impressed by this movie. Impresseed enough to write my first review for IMDb.",Funny Games
502,ahhhitschow,This movie contained nothing more than would a college critique essay on American film in general,2,21 August 2008,"Although the movie contained unique screenplay and concepts (such as characters speaking directly to the audience, I found it had no value as a two-hour horror film. Of course, as any other horror film, it contained a high degree of disturbia, violence, and utter creepiness, but all in all, i thought it could have been better summed up in a thesis to an essay about American film. If Haneke wanted so bad to call out US film making and its ""stick-it-to-the- bad-guy"" relief endings, then I'm sure anyone that cared would have just read his movie critiques and/or been much more interested in seeking out it's German counterpart. I'm not so sure it was a film well worthy of being remade and repositioned in an American market. I expected the disturbing nature of the film, however, i found that in some places, it more dragged than suspended me in wait of the next terrible scene. In relation, it was more worthless as Shyamalan's ""The Happening"", also containing an obscene murder of a child, but with much more shock value. At least The Happening legitimately had more of a thorough plot, with a point at the movie's end. All intelligent critique aside: I completely wish I had never discovered and paid money to watch this film. It was a complete waste of my time and if i wanted to be reminded that psychopaths exist and DO get away with murder (no justice involved), i could have just read the front page of CNN.com once a week.

For me though, I think the stupidest moment was when the killers have ""left"" the house after the son has gotten killed and the husband is telling her to climb out the window and get help (because their cell phone was dropped into the sink), she asks where his cell phone is, he tells her it's in the car...instead of her going to the car and getting the only working phone, she gets a hair dryer and starts drying hers (for what seemed like an hour)???

Without portraying any scene of violence, you know it is happening. Instead of having a ""scary movie"" having a ""feel good"" Hollywood ending, it won't let you be sure that it will happen. It portraits what actually could happen if the Hollywood gravy wasn't poured over the script. It shows you what you wouldn't expect.Unpredictability is good, if you actually would like this. Who enjoys a pizza deliciously portrayed on the box, that tastes like old roadkill ? Without depicting violence, you clearly know that horrible acts have been done. Acts that you wouldn't take seriously because in a slasher movie, you know it will all be over after the lights come on. Funny Fames doesn't grant you that feeling because it wants to be a wake up call to everyone desensitized by violence.That would work if it wouldn't be so immensely direct. I found this movie very disturbing because of the fact that almost all movies still are movies, this feels like a snuff documentary. This movie won't help anti-desensitizing violence.

The director manipulates the audience's vulnerability like no other move I've ever seen.When the antagonist first turned to look directly at me and spoke, as an aside, directly to me, I knew this was a movie in a class of it's own. I also realized that, like the kidnapped family, any hope I had for a righteous or just ending, was baseless and unrealistic. Evil was on full display and there was no way to overcome it because I, like the victims of the home invasion, was powerless.UNTIL the director gave the viewer an out. SPOILER: when the protagonist grabbed the remote control and rewound the scene to the point where he could then control the plot to his advantage, then I realized there is no reason why I cannot do the same. And since the director provided no evidence that the wife drowned, then I decided to take control over the plot, just as the protagonist did. What we do not see, but exists in the mental draft of a sequel in my head, is that the wife was able to survive the rough waters and swam home, crawled her way to her shattered house until she grabs the remote for herself, thus rewinding all the way to the beginning before the home invasion occurred saving her son and husband from the future deadly encounter with those two psychopaths.And it was this justification that finally allowed me to fall asleep.What a movie!",Funny Games

I turned it off after 45 min because i couldn't continue to watch this.. the torture in watching this is much much worse than the torture in the movie. Oh i forgot there is no torture in the movie just meaningless comments and conversations about random stuff. The torture in the movie is watching those 2 act. For a movie from 2007 its ( i say it again ) terrible!!!Low budget movie , they did not spent any money on furniture, locations, cloth, nothing. Everything just looks used  , the worst movie i seen in years , how the hell can it be rated 6,5 stars , people what happend ??? Stop trick others by rate it 10 stars please, my friday evening is destroyed.. so sad and angry and salty about this... wow just wow..",Funny Games
509,jeffkluckman,Horrible in every way,1,5 September 2019,Dont waste your time. You'll never get it back. I wish I could rate this stupid movie lower. The story is badly written. The budget is prob $5 and they had some left over.,Funny Games
510,samijakko,The most sickest and worst movie I have ever seen!,1,17 December 2017,"Awful movie! I could not watch the hole movie so I skipped straight to the end and was hoping that those annoying guys would been killed. That never happened. Anyway, how someone can be so nasty and out of his mind that would create this kind of movie. I was scared nowhere in this movie, because this movie was kind of boring. And so disgusting. Definitely big NO for this movie!",Funny Games

512,TRyckman2,Awful,1,3 August 2008,The fact that any review posted here could possibly have any positive comments about this movie is ridiculous. I looked forward to this movie and thought it might be a bit disturbing. It lost any credibility it had halfway through the movie. I have never written a movie review before good or bad but this was so bad I couldn't help myself. In fact it was so bad I will avoid any other movies made by this director like the plague. I had the original slated for rental and will definitely be canceling that. How you could take a movie with this idea and come up with something so silly I'll never know. Avoid it unless you like wasting time. Good actors wasted in a bad movie. Almost 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.,Funny Games
513,LegitSalt,Total Entertainment Forever,10,18 February 2019,"Juxtaposition. This film uses and reuses juxtaposition so effectively, it might as well be a case study in the technique. The first example of this is in the opening credits, as classical music is suddenly replaced with an intense metal sound. Later, the fourth-wall is used to juxtapose brutal and intense actions.
Before I turned this film on, I had never seen a Haneke film, and now, two weeks later I had seen four. Haneke is able to direct and control the motion and action on the screen with such expertise, it is a wonder that he is more appreciated. In the case of 'Funny Games', the kid not only has an incredible emotional range but also seems almost too authentic.
Naomi Watts and Tim Roth play some of the most engaging characters that I have seen on screen to date, causing the audience to feel and experience their every pain. In regards to horror, this movie excels. Lashing out brutally under the cover of wealthy, kind, white folk, yet, at the same time, never truly showing anything at all. No violence is ever permanently shown on screen, not only allowing for incredible suspense build up, but also eliminating any need for CGI blood or gore.
This movie also serves as a parody and cometary of both white elitist culture, and the cheap horror genre. In one case, pointing out the ridiculousness of having few individuals so much higher in wealth and status than others. Whilst for the other, commenting on the unnecessary violence, and brutal torture, all in the name of entertainment, our entertainment. In this regard, the movie mocks its own viewers, with the questions it poses in regards to why the film is happening, and what is being obtained from it. In the end, we don't win, the expectations that we are openly promised my the tormentors are shown to be pipe dreams, and everyone dies.
After this, the movie comes full circle, and it is made clear that this futile effort will be repeated ad nauseum, resulting in the same outcome each time. There is a particularly well-composed scene when the kid is at the neighbour's house. Here, he is stealthily walking around, trying to avoid his captor. This fails when he comes face to face with the decimated corpse of the former resident, which sparks a downward spiral leading to his capture and death.
I could go on and on about how excellent this film is, but I still have to admit it has its flaws. The main ones being the convenience of having no landline, and the moronic behaviour of Naomi Watts as she tries to flee. Despite these missteps, I love this film, and will no doubt return to it. I recommend this to anyone interested in either film, horror, or intense engaging stories.",Funny Games
514,cboullon,crap !!!!,1,29 October 2008,"Incredible crap, waste of of everything, I guess the director was actually trying to make the worst movie ever, with no point and extremely long and scenes that do not reach to any conclusion, call it artistic, call it good cinematography but this movie in general sucks, I guess people that have nothing to do with their life's and think that movies like this are fascinating well this movie in my opinion is horrible, and I can say I am pretty open minded when it comes to movies... Don't waste your money on this crap, or at least read the reviews, you might save money and time...I would try to shout but I can't, this site doesn't let me",Funny Games
515,luvlilly84,Expect an Art Film,8,12 September 2008,"I will admit that as I watched this movie, I felt myself being disappointed in it. Then I realized that was because I was expecting a Hollywood big budget film following the conventions sat in place by most films. This is not most films.Instead, this movie explores the art of film. It gives realistic camera angles, watching one character and hearing the others without seeing them. It plays with major film techniques and copies those of major director's over time who have done the same. When you watch the film, be a film student, not just a viewer. Enjoy the movie for what it is saying to you without words. It makes you feel emotions without creepy psycho music to speed your heart. You will be disappointed if you are expecting a typical film. You will be blown away if you study it like a student.",Funny Games

517,sblme03,Waste of Time,2,16 March 2008,"This movie was not very good at all. The clockwork orange vibe intrigued me and was drawn into seeing the film. Turns out it didn't deserve to be used in the same sentence as A Clockwork Orange.Many people in my theater walked out midway and i was tempted to as well. The only thing that kept me from leaving was that I wanted to see how they could possibly end this movie, with the ridiculous plot that it had already.Turns out I probably should've left early on. As soon as the film ended there was an almost unison ""are you f---ing kidding me?"" and ""that movie sucked!"".You have been warned.",Funny Games
518,compulsory-sorry,"No...just, no",2,20 September 2010,"I love movies that shock me, scare me, and make me think. Irreversible, Guinea Pig, Visitor Q; my tolerance for the bizarre knows no limits. Unfortunately, Funny Games does none of these things. The violence is pretty minimal, and poorly done overall. There are no ""ahh!"" scary moments, nor is there any great sense of suspense. There are entire blocks of time reaching up to 25 minutes which could have been cut from the movie entirely without changing anything. Really, it's not a good sign when a half hour of your movie contains no dialogue, no significant plot development, just some walking around and crying. This is not an action-packed film, nor is it a film with a lot of dialogue that enables character development and sympathy for the victims. There is really just a whole lot of nothing.The acting was alright, at least on the part of the main antagonist, but I found his sidekick and all of the victims to be lacking. They had so many opportunities to get out of their situation, and they certainly did not behave as normal people would under those circumstances. It's hard to feel sorry for them when they're just so stupid. Any belief that remained was thrown out the window when they continually breached the fourth wall by speaking to the audience (always a great device) and rewinding time (???) with no explanation whatsoever.A movie I would compare this to is Open Water. If for some reason you enjoyed Open Water, you may enjoy this. Funny Games is not good, and it's not even bad enough to be good. You should look elsewhere.",Funny Games

520,johnljohn,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,1,14 February 2019,"Literally every aspect of this movie was the worst I've ever seen. The writing, the directing, editing, lighting.... I could go on and on but I don't wanna waste anymore of your time. But I will say only NEARLY all of the acting was bad. Pitt actually did a decent job with his character given what he had to work with. The rest were just embarrassing. Although, I will give Watts a pinch of credit for her ability to show some emotion, unlike Roth, but her character was so stupid that it didn't really help her out any. The only nice thing I can say about this film is that it's so stupid, I didn't have to watch it to the end. The only reason I'm writing a review is because I was so annoyed that it motivated me to do all I can to help mankind. If I can keep (save) at least one other person from watching this film, then I feel I've done my duty.",Funny Games
