0,MartinHafer,"Decent, though rather predictable",7,15 July 2008,"BILLY ELLIOT is about an 11 year-old boy who hates boxing and instead of continuing with this class, switches to ballet. He loves to dance but is afraid to tell his working-class family because of the perceived ""unmanliness"" of dance, so he practices without their knowledge until he can no longer hide it--as he has a chance to go to a prestigious ballet academy in London. Will his father and weasel-like older brother back off and let him be who he wants to be or will Billy be cursed to be stuck in a dying town for the rest of his life?I was very surprised that an inspirational movie like BILLY ELLIOT would be rated R. Generally, this sort of movie is perfect family fare and in so many ways this film is. However, the profuse use of vulgarities really make this a family-unfriendly film and it loses most of its audience. It wasn't just the language that was crude, but hand gestures and sexualized nature of the film that disturbed me. Now for non-British audiences, this might not seem as bad because some of the references have different meanings in other countries. The word ""fanny"" and the gesture looking like the ""peace sign"" are interpreted 100% differently in the US, for example--as here, neither would be considered obscene or family-inappropriate. Some may argue that the film used these crudities because that is how people are in these mining towns and perhaps this is true, but would it have seriously negatively impacted the film if these references would have been toned down? I sure doubt it AND the movie could have reached a much wider audience. This is all a real shame, as the structure of the film is similar to many family films. You know, one where someone or a group overcomes tons of obstacles in order to make their dream come true. Plus, as you KNOW that they will win in the end (so there isn't much real tension), this is a style film that might NOT appeal to the more discriminating adult viewer and SHOULD have more appeal more to kids.As for the rest of the film, it's very well made and entertaining. The acting is fine, the cinematography and direction are all fine. It is a good film--though also one that isn't a ""must-see"" due to it being rather formulaic and therefore predictable. Worth a look, but don't rush out to rent this one.",Billy Elliot
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Beautiful, honest, touching, poignant- a truly remarkable film",9,2 February 2010,"This movie is such a good film for a number of reasons. As a study of daring to be different in the fact of intractable tradition, Billy Elliot is beautiful, touching, poignant and very honest. It does start off slowly, but the film does have a lot of heart. Firstly, I liked the story, a young boy who wishes to ballet dance against the the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike, it was a nice one and is likely to evoke some emotion. Stage director Stephen Daldry makes his feature debut here, and succeeds pretty much brilliantly. Another strong asset was the writing, while funny in places, it is also quite touching. Then the music, I loved hearing the music Tchaikovsky's timeless ballet ""Swan Lake"", such a melancholy yet enchanting and haunting score. But really the best asset of the film is the acting. Jamie Bell gives a really believable performance in the lead role, while Gary Lewis is marvellous as his dad. The acting honours though go to the brilliant Julie Walters as Billy's chain smoking dance instructor, that role especially proves what a fine actress Walters is. In conclusion, I loved this film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Billy Elliot
2,Leofwine_draca,"Some problems, but generally good",6,5 April 2020,"BILLY ELLIOT is a mix of tough working class drama and feel good northern comedy; KES meets THE FULL MONTY, if you will. I enjoyed it although I don't think it's a particular classic. The main character feels more than a little hollow to me, you don't really learn much about him other than he likes dancing. Jamie Bell has the physicality but otherwise I felt him a bit one-dimensional. What makes up for this is the excellent 1980s backdrop, which has an air of grit and authenticity to it; that steep Durham street becomes a character in its own right. Details involving the striking miners and the difficult family situation are done just right. While I don't think it's as good as the two films I mentioned above, it's still worth checking out for fans of the feel-good rags-to-riches genre.",Billy Elliot
3,SnoopyStyle,Julie Walters and Gary Lewis,6,19 July 2014,"It's Durham Coalfield, North East England 1984. There is a violent strike against Thatcher and the scabs working the coal mines. Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) lives with widower father Jackie (Gary Lewis) and older brother Tony. Both of them are former miners who would take a dim view of Billy's love of dance. His Grandma is losing her mind. Instead of boxing, he starts going to Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters)'s all girls ballet class.Director Stephen Daldry is trying too hard to cute this one up. Billy doesn't have to dance in the boxing ring. He just has to be pathetic. Jamie Bell is a good little actor but he looks too angry to be funny. His jumping around is quirky but not hilarious. He's better to be quietly hiding instead of confronting his father. I wouldn't call this feel-good. It's Julie Walters and Gary Lewis who elevates the material. They're are a couple of veteran actors who bring substance to this fanciful tale.",Billy Elliot
4,Hitchcoc,Is It Hanging on the Shirttails of the Musical,7,19 September 2012,"It's certainly a good story. It has heroes and villains and the heart of the artist put to the test. The reason I didn't react to it so well is that I've been there a hundred times before. That is not to say a movie about following your dream isn't valid. It's in the telling and I didn't feel anything new. That said, the performances are quite good. The clashes over artistry are more subtle than I thought they would be. The connection made, finally, with the father and his sacrifices are worthy. But for me, it seemed clichéd. Even that connection appeared a bit contrived and out of character with someone in such a volatile setting. I know that this is an immensely popular musical that is sweeping the country in 2012 after years in European venues. I will see it if I have a chance. I have a suspicion that the music raises it and the dancing puts a punctuation mark on it. Perhaps the story is made more by nature of the artistic extension.",Billy Elliot
5,classicsoncall,"""This is when you go out and find life, and all those other things.""",7,4 May 2018,"Where I thought this film was going in the early stages was for Billy (Jamie Bell) to take up ballet dancing as a way to improve his stamina and footwork for the boxing ring. That would have made sense in what appeared to be a fairly male dominated society in an English county reliant on coal mining for it's livelihood. Even though Billy's Father (Gary Lewis) and older brother Tony (Jamie Draven) initially derided his dancing initiative, there comes a point in the story when the coal strike takes it's toll, and it's understood that the mining industry is all but over, and ballet may be the only way out of poverty for the youngest son. The film follows somewhat of a standard formula which includes a supportive and sympathetic dance instructor (Julie Walters), snickers from the sidelines over Billy's decision to dance, and a close friend who's friendship with Billy is tested regarding his sexuality. None of these factors ever seem to reach a critical point that would have broken the resolve of a less committed individual, and therefore Billy's struggle doesn't have the kind of epic feel similar stories tend to have. It's not bad mind you, it's just that Billy's struggle never really faced a crucial test, even with the audition for the Royal Ballet. Yes, there was some tension built in waiting for Billy's acceptance, but by that time it's pretty well recognized by the viewer that the film isn't going to let you down.I recall that the movie received generally positive reviews when it first came out. This was my first viewing, and for a film nominally regarded as family fare, it probably could have done with a lot less use of the 'F' word and swearing in general, particularly by the principal character. Maybe my expectations on that are somewhat out of date, but I have a thirteen year old grandson who doesn't use the kind of colorful language Billy did. I don't think removing the obscenities would be any kind of handicap, in fact if it's not there, who's going to miss it?",Billy Elliot
6,gavin6942,Not My Cup of Tea,6,3 March 2015,"A talented young boy (Jamie Bell) becomes torn between his unexpected love of dance and the disintegration of his family.Although this film is alright, it just really did not appeal to me. I have no real interest in ballet or dancing, so I could not connect with the main character. I understand the theme is broader than that -- that we all have talents and need to bring them out. That is a good message. Just did not hit me hard in this film.What is even more interesting is how much discussion this film seems to generate about sexuality, and whether or not Billy is gay. Some say he is, some say he is not. The real answer seems to be: why does it matter? Especially when you consider he is supposed to be 11 years old. His sexuality should not be anyone's concern!",Billy Elliot
7,lee_eisenberg,"That was the Thatcher years, I guess.",10,25 October 2005,"A combo of a personal triumph and a look at a historical event, ""Billy Elliot"" is a triumph for all involved. During the 1984-85 miners' strike in England, the Elliot family is falling apart. Son Billy (Jamie Bell) manages to find a way out: he takes up dancing. Granted, his family is rather shocked at this, but the newfound talent helps Billy through life.Every part of this movie was perfectly done; I can't possibly stress it sufficiently. A particularly moving scene shows Billy's father scabbing on the other workers. Another of the many great movies to come from England.",Billy Elliot
8,jboothmillard,Billy Elliot,8,8 July 2005,"I always remembered the sequence with ""I Love to Boogie"" by T. Rex, and bits and pieces of the lead child actor dancing, but overall, I couldn't remember the full plot and story, so I looked forward to watching it again for a better opinion, from Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Stephen Daldry (The Hours, The Reader, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close). Basically, set in 1984, eleven-year-old Billy Elliot (BAFTA winning Jamie Bell) lives in Everington, County Durham, England, with his widowed father, Jackie (Gary Lewis), and older brother, Tony (Jamie Draven), and his maternal grandmother (Jean Heywood), who has Alzheimer's disease. His father and brother are both coal miners out on strike and his grandmother once aspired to be a professional dancer. Billy's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the same gym as their basement studio is temporarily being used as a soup kitchen for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class, led by dancer teacher Sandra Wilkinson (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Julie Walters). Billy loves pop music and to dance and now has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Mrs. Wilkinson offers to secretly continue teaching him dance lessons. Mrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the Royal Ballet School in London. Unfortunately, dues to Tony being arrested in a clash between the police and the striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but he fears that Billy will be ridiculed and considered gay. Both Billy's father and brother are outraged by the prospect of Billy becoming a professional ballet dancer. During Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael (Stuart Wells) is gay, but Billy is supportive. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted. He has a change of heart and wants to do whatever it takes to help Billy achieve his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to get back to work to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, Jackie's fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Billy's mother's jewellery is pawned to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition. Although very nervous, Billy performs well in front of the panel. He fears however that he has ruined his chances and it has been a waste of time, and in frustration he punches another boy. This incident is reported to the board, but when asked how he feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words, but eventually expresses his passion, describing it as being ""like electricity"" (the words used in the song when the film was turned into a stage musical, written by Elton John). With Billy seemingly rejected, he and his father return home. Sometime later, Billy receives a letter from the Royal Ballet School, and is emotional to read that he has been accepted. At the same time, the miners' strike comes to an end. Billy leaves home for London. Fourteen years later, twenty-five-year-old Billy (Adam Cooper) takes to the stage as the Swan in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, with Jackie, Tony, and Michael (Merryn Owen) watching in the audience. Billy's father is visibly moved by his performance. Also starring Mike Elliot as George Watson, Colin MacLachlan as Mr. Wilkinson, Janine Birkett as Billy's Mum, Emmerdale's Charlie Hardwick as Sheila Briggs, Stephen Mangan as Ballet Doctor, Patrick Malahide as Principal, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Vice-Principal, and Zoë Bell as Sandra. Bell gives a fantastic debut performance of the young boy eager to dance, Walters is also splendid as his supportive chain-smoking teacher, and Lewis is marvellous as Billy's reactionary father. The best bits are obviously the dance sequences, with the songs ""Get It On"" by T. Rex, and seeing Billy jumping on his bed, but there is also great attention to detail with the 80s era, and there are interesting moments in between, overall it is a most worthwhile comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best British Film, and it was nominated for the Best Music for Stephen Warbeck, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound, Most Promising Newcomer for director Stephen Daldry and writer Lee Hall, and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Julie Walters was number 5 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 2 on Britain's Finest Actresses. Very good!",Billy Elliot
9,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Billy Elliott',6,6 December 2006,"This is a charming film but don't be fooled; it's still yet another with the typical Liberal/politically-correct agenda. Fortunately, even for those of us who can see through this propaganda nonsense, it was still an entertaining film that had its good points, too, enough to be glad, at least, that I watched it. Why filmmakers have to constant push their gay agendas on the movie public, you'd have to ask them.Anyway, the good points are (1) the film is never boring; always entertaining; (2) it's nicely filmed, looking great on DVD; (3) the lead kid ""Billy Elliott"" (Jamie Bell) is a likable lad and an excellent actor; (4) the guy who played his father (Gary Lewis) was also good, playing an intense character; (5) the music and dancing were good and I enjoyed the Fred Astaire and Lord Of The Dance-type numbers (which I prefer over ballet, anyway).Other negatives included : 1 - an unlikeable dance teacher ""Mrs. Wilkinson"" (Julie Waters), who was too hard-edged (profane, cigarette dangling from her mouth); 2 - too much profanity in general in this film (way too many f-words, kids using the Lord's name in vain, etc.); 3 - Billy, although likable, talks back too much to adults and has a bad mouth; 4 - Billy's father and brother (Jamie Draven) with exaggerated roles as the ultra-macho stereotypes.",Billy Elliot
10,ma-cortes,This enjoyable and charming movie has all-around appeal and some fine acting .,7,12 November 2021,"Eleven-year-old Billy is attempting to survive in Durham County town during the 1984 miners' strike that is affecting his family . This kind family is formed by motherless Billy (Jamie Bell) , whose elder brother (Jamie Draven) and father are involved in the violent strike and Grandma (Jean Heywood) . The unfortunate widowed dad (Gary Lewis) wants Billy to take bossing lessons but the boy is more interested in the ballet class taught at the same gym by hard-living Mrs Wilkinson (Dame Julie Walters) whose daughter Debbie (Blackwell) taunts Billy into trying to dance . Mrs Wilkinson is a dispirited soul who finds as much genuine pleasure nurture the orginal talent and hope of this 11-year-old as he does in the discipline and support of her surrogacy . Young Billy finds he prefers joining in the girls' ballet class at the local hall to the boxing he's there for . The ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson , soon realizes he has real potential , and she encourages him to audition for the Royal Ballet School in London , but no-one , least of all his family, is likely to go along with a dancing boy . Inside every one of us is a special talent waiting to come out . The trick is finding it.Amusing and entertaining musical dramedy set against the background of an increasingly bitter miners' strike , including an agreeable soundtrack by Stephen Warbeck and catching songs . Regrettably , the unsentimental
depiction of the working class Northeast in Lee Hall's semi-autobiographical storyline has been tinged with ironical touches and caricature elements . Director Stephen Daldry non-officially adopted aspiring actor Jamie Bell whilst shooting this Billy Elliot (2000) , after auditioning for the role over two thousand boys . In fact , Bell was only one of the four main actors to actually come from the area where this film is set . Resulting to be Jamie Bell film debut , giving a natural talent as the stubborn boy who attempts to get a great dream : to take up dancing against the wishes of his collier father and older brother , and he will stop a nothing to get it . While Julie Walters is perfect as Mrs Wilkinson , providing the conventional dramatic arc and adding a real emotional feeling . Gary Lewis is first rate as the embittered father who surprisingly cheeks the tendency to a supposedly female dancing of his obstinate child . Along with other excellent secondaries as Jamie Draven , Jean Heywood , Stuart Wells , Patrick Malahide , Barbara Leigh-Hunt , Zoë Bell's debut and Adam Cooper , an actual dancer , as aged 25 Billy .Stage director Stephen Daldry makes his film debut as does Jamie Bell . Daldry is a good director whose films often contain a character who tries to seek some form of redemption , and his roles usually progress with the help of another character generally focus on female ones , including interpretations honored with an Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role by Nicole Kidman in The Hours (2002) and Kate Winslet in The Reader (2008) . Daldry has directed 6 actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Julie Walters, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris, Julianne Moore, Kate Winslet, and Max von Sydow. Kidman and Winslet both won Oscars for performances in one of his movies. Rating : 7.5/10. Well worth watching . Essential and indispensable seeing .",Billy Elliot
11,moonspinner55,He loves to dance--but he's no 'poof'!,6,2 March 2002,"Contrived, somewhat negligent, but entertaining film about young British boy from a tough working-class environment who wants to be a ballet dancer. And can you blame him? All around are swearing, spitting adults and riot police! In its more subtle moments, the film touches on a certain childhood rebellion that can be seen in shades of anger and joy; however, it is so determined to be a cookie-cutter product (with artistic flourishes) that the audience almost gets impatient waiting for the inevitable triumphs. Despite the formula, there are some very fine performances and nice directorial touches, although the rock-and-roll dancing montage (to T. Rex?!) is too much like an MTV interlude for such a prestigious production and sticks out like the commercial device it is. **1/2 from ****",Billy Elliot
12,Quinoa1984,The Tale of the Tiny Dancer,8,1 December 2000,"Billy Elliot is one of the most enjoyable dramedies I've seen in a while. It is the opposite of the other independent smash Girlfight (girl becomes boxer instead of dancer, here boy becomes dancer instead of boxer).  The sprawling makes the film a little long, but it is worth the effort to watch this film for some fine performances (especially Jamie Bell as the lead) and some of the best dancing I've seen on celluloid.   Good film for a good time.  A-",Billy Elliot
13,hitchcockthelegend,Masterful coming of age drama without sugar and soap.,10,4 March 2008,"After revisiting this film again recently, I stick my chest out and state proudly that the film touches me on so many levels that my emotions go all over the shop. For a film that is in essence a feel good coming of age drama it is mightily impressive that the film never veers down that street known as sickly boulevard.Set against the grim backdrop of the English Coal Miners strikes the film tackles an array of subjects, class struggles, fear of homosexuality, youthful adventure in discovering potential adulthood, and the universal joy that music and dance can bring to us all, even in the most trying of circumstances. So many great scenes here that are both happy and sad, Billy's father feels he has to break the strike to give Billy a chance in life, this leads to a truly heartbreaking scene between him and his eldest son, I weep unashamedly at the realism of it all, the dancing is just wonderful, with too many great scenes to only pick just one out, the film is a seamless classic that ticks every box that I personally require from a film like this.The cast are magnificent, Jamie Bell perfectly layers the lead role of Billy by fusing confusion, joy, fear, hope, and sorrow into one almighty performance. Julie Walters is up to her usual standard of greatness, whilst Gary Lewis as the father is nothing short of tremendous, they all can take a bow for making such a wonderful movie. The soundtrack is music gold, you can never have enough T-Rex in your life, ever, and I ask if there has ever been a more appropriate use of music than the use of The Jam's-Town Called Malice? Paul Weller's up tempo beat belies it's sombre lyrics, the song is about a town besieged by unemployment, a great scene accompanies the song as Billy dances out his frustrations down the street; ""you either cut down on the beer or the kids new gear, it's a big decision in a town called Malice"".Brilliant! Maybe I'm biased because I remember the miners strikes, a sad and desperate time for the industry that was about to go under, perhaps I love it for the sheer sympathy the characters garner, or could it just be that it's an incredibly human story that is laid out fantastically well with an ending that demands a positive response from the viewer? Either way it rates 10/10 for me and it always will.",Billy Elliot
14,Theo Robertson,Typical British Fare,6,28 March 2005,"This is a movie very similar to a large number of British movies produced from 1995 to 2000 . Notice how it falls into a formula ? 1 ) The protagonist is trying to pursue a dream in spite of adversity 2) It's set in the North of England 3 ) There's a blossoming romance involving the main protagonist and a supporting character 4 ) The main female lead is a strong character played by an actress known originally for their TV work 5 ) There's a political subtext BILLY ELLIOT follows the same formula as all the other films that preceded it like WHEN Saturday COMES , THE FULL MONTY , LITTLE VOICE , BRASSED OFF etc and is probably the last in the line of this typical British film making fare from the last years of the 20th century . Thankfully someone soon realised there's only so much that an audience can take before you kill the golden goose On its own BILLY ELLIOT works because it says a lot about British working class culture . Name almost any foreign country you want and the reply will be getting blind drunk , getting into mindless punch ups and becoming pregnant at 14 is a reason for shame . Alas British working class mores seems to allow this type of self destructive behaviour . What it doesn't allow is young boys to follow their ambitions as a ballet dancer less they be accused of being "" some sort of poof "" and the movie hits the nail on the head with this type of Brit culture . Yeah it might be ignorant attitude but that's the way it is in this country . Unfortunately by being so accurate as to British working class mentality means that BILLY ELLIOT works better as social commentary rather than entertainment",Billy Elliot
15,jotix100,Coal miner's son,7,21 November 2008,"Can a boy from a macho background overcome all obstacles and go to be a star in the Royal Ballet company? Well, that is the premise of this feel good film that we saw when it first came out, but didn't comment. Watching it for a second time, recently, didn't produce the same effect as when initially seen on the big screen. Something was lost, but it is still an inspirational story.Billy, a young boy from a poor background in the coal country in the North of England, realizes he has a passion for dancing. Since he doesn't know how to channel his desire for becoming a classic dancer, he has to get all the help he can get. With the guidance of Mrs. Wilkinson, a local dance coach, Billy finds the inspiration he needs to go on into that world, so foreign to a young boy of his class.In a way, we couldn't help comparing ""Billy Elliot"" to ""Educating Rita"", not that they are similar in any shape, or form. Maybe the presence of the irrepressible Julie Walters, who appears in this case as the teacher, was the link and the basis of comparison. Her work in the film doesn't dominate the action, but her contribution to the overall success of it is an undeniable factor. Young Jamie Bell endears himself to the audience with his take on the would be dancer that wants to expand his own talent.Stephen Daltry directed with panache the screenplay by Lee Hall. Mr. Daltry's work with the two principals wins us over.

I liked it, but it just wasn't as good as I had heard it was.  Basically, a very good little movie.  But not worth $9.00.  Also, the R rating is wrong. Yes, there's a lot of swearing, but it shows a little boy who, against all odds, prevails.  That's a great message for kids.  It should have gotten a PG-13.",Billy Elliot

Shows his trials and tribulations in convincing his rough-hewn father and brother to support him. Story is manipulatively sentimental, but has many funny moments. Maybe a bit too join-the-dots, and didn't dig deep enough into the characters. Direction is solid, though the movie loses pace in the middle section and drifts a bit. The use of music was great, though there is an over-reliance on T-Rex.Good performances all round. Julie Walters deserved her Oscar nomination.",Billy Elliot

Also some of the scene's are way too over-sentimental to make the story feel believable and touching. I mean, Billy and his tough father playing and laughing on the ground? Please...I seriously almost changed channels after that.Still there are some elements in this movie that prevent this from being a silly over the top drama. The good subtle British humor and atmosphere is one of them. Jamie Bell's acting is the other.

The film is technically excellent, artistically well done, and follows the traditions of Hollywood film-making. The story is a pleasant mix of humor and pathos, not too deep, and palatable enough to make it an audience favorite. In addition to being just plain fun to watch, ""BE"" makes a few points about accepting people for who they are; about the undeniability of innate passion by artists; and about the sublimation of aggression through dance. Not a classic and somewhat over rated, the simple numbers prove ""BE"" is a box office favorite and an enjoyable watch for most.

21,KineticSeoul,Somewhat sensational but nothing really spectacular,6,13 February 2012,"This wasn't a movie that was amazing as I thought it would be, but it's still a good movie. Just didn't reach the level where it really tugs on the heartstrings or moving in a really riveting manner. But it still brings about emotions and is somewhat sensational. The plot is basically about a boy dealing with family issues and other conflicts find passion and talent in ballet dancing and has some other elements as well. Maybe I was expecting a bit more or had a bit of a high expectation for this movie. Or maybe it's because the movie really goes in a slightly tedious and predictable direction. This movie can not be narrowed down to a feel good movie and can be sort of inspiring. Because it shows a boy going through struggles but can't give up his passion for dancing. Still it's a movie I felt was sort of difficult to get really immersed into and enthusiastic or even excited about.

22,sddavis63,Surprisingly Good,8,3 June 2002,"How interesting could a movie about a boy who gives up boxing to become a ballet dancer be? Actually, the answer is - very! This took me by surprise. It's well acted and well written, and presents an interesting look not just at Billy's (Jamie Bell) struggle to succeed in ballet but also a good historical overview of the Coal Miner's strike during the Thatcher era from the perspective of an affected family (Billy's.) Billy's widowed father Gary Lewis and brother Jamie Draven are striking miners, and neither are interested in having a ballet dancing ""puff"" in the family. We get to watch their attitudes change, however, as both realize that ballet could be Billy's ticket out of the wretched life they've been forced to lead.This truly was a pleasure to watch.

There are fine performances from Walters as the local ballet teacher and Lewis as the father who thinks his son is a sissy. Bell does well as the little boy with happy feet. Daldry displays a visual elegance, but does not always succeed in balancing the parallel stories of Billy and the coal miner's strike. Ultimately the film becomes too sentimental and manipulative, grabbing every opportunity to tug at the viewer's heartstrings. It also advances the stereotype of male ballet dancers being gay.

Bell has his own prejudices that he learns to deal with, fighting his own preconceptions that all other boys who do ballet are ""bent"" and Bell gives us a multi-dimensional character with a love for dance that resonates but also much internal anger. Julie Walters is equally as impressive as his spunky ballet teacher and they really carry the film. The less said about Bell's father, the better though. His father changes so quickly from being against ballet to in favour of it that the progression never rings true. The film has some crafty moments though in which the father's difficulties with work and participation in demonstrations are edited against Bell dancing. More could have probably been made of Bell emerging from such working class origins, but the film has plenty to like as it is with its celebration of dance as something that boys and girls can both succeed at.",Billy Elliot
25,Dr_Coulardeau,It is all in your feet,10,22 June 2020,"It is a real drama to be eleven and to have a dream that does not fit perfectly well in your surroundings. Billy discovers ballet dancing at 11 years of age and decides without any support from his father and elder brother who are coal miners, at first because for them a boy is supposed to like boxing, wrestling, football, etc. But not ballet dancing. His mother is dead, and she used to play the piano that is in the living room. And the family takes care of the maternal grandmother. She is the only one who timidly supports Billy when it is discovered that instead of going to the boxing class, he goes to the ballet dancing class where he is the only boy among all the girls that attend.It was during the coal miners' strike in England (Mar 6, 1984 - Mar 3, 1985). I actually was the interpreter of Arthur Scargill when he spoke on Radio Quinquin in Nord Pas de Calais in France. That was a very sad period. In fact, the closing of the coal mines in England and Wales had been written on the agenda for a long time already, since the early 1960s when coal-burning was banned from all English cities and particularly London to get rid of the smog that killed thousands of people every winter. Coal lost then one of its most important clients. The mines were doomed. Even in the industry, it was too late, and coal was giving way to oil, natural gas, electricity of course, and nuclear energy more than coal-burning power stations. Margaret Thatcher decided to close the mines and the one-year-long strike did not make her change her mood and decision. The Miners' Union had to accept a defeat. This background and the violence that went along with it, and the breaking of the mother's piano in order to have some fire and heat in the house for Christmas 1984, all that makes the film extremely poignant and the decision of the father to go back to work in order to cover the audition cost for his son at the Royal Ballet School in London was more than courageous: to be a scab to pay for his eleven-year-old son's dream. The hostility of his elder brother at first though he changed his mind later on when Billy was accepted, is also understandable: how can that young man accept his own father to be a traitor in the strike he was active in?Then the film deals with that dream in the most fascinating way. Billy's best friend, Michael, is what Billy says he is not, and yet they remain friends and Michael supports Billy's dream though he knows he will have to accept to remain a friend and enjoy this friendship, and a farewell brotherly kiss on the day of Billy's departure for London. Michael's last call on that departure day ""Dancing Boy!"" is so natural, so deep, and so truly emotional that such a short scene is maybe the most beautiful moment in this film. Two boys, one gay, one not, parting for life at eleven and yet hugging their farewell that will also last forever in their memories.That's the magic of the film. Billy is able to establish personal and deeply emotional relations with other people. With Michael, of course, but also with his own father and his elder brother, not to mention his grandmother and the dancing teacher who discovered him and encouraged him and trained him into being successful through discipline and commitment. Billy has the best definition of his feelings when he is dancing. He is alive like electricity, and this is so true. In such creative moments in the life of a person, this person feels so intensely alive that he or she is pure electromagnetic energy.But Billy was lucky. How many young teenagers have dreams and cannot reach them, realize them? So many elements can block such dreams. The family and the close circle of acquaintances and friends come first because they expect you to be this or that and not what you dream of being. Then the educational opportunities you have and that enable you or not to step in the direction of fulfilling your dream. Then there are all sorts of cultural difficulties and obstacles you must confront if you want to get into some creative career. But most of all you have to overcome your own psychological difficulties and first of all develop the discipline you need to impose onto yourself if you want to succeed, to be the best or at least one of the best. I have seen so many dreams being hijacked and ruined by so many mishaps that I am afraid I can say I know that thousands of Mozarts and thousands of Einsteins have been discarded into the cesspool of history and did not realize the dreams they had espied in their minds at ten or eleven years of age.This film then is so optimistic, so full of hope that we should show it every year in every school in every country in every world if there are more worlds than just one.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Billy Elliot
26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Billy Elliot"" grounds the magic and passion of dancing into reality",9,31 August 2009,"Dancing, passion and familial struggle are all tied together in the high-spirited ""Billy Elliot,"" the little independent film that could in 2000, when such films were drastically under- appreciated. ""Billy Elliot"" caught some attention however because it combines the dream-like fancy-free spirit of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films along with the social-historical context of the '80s coal miner strike in England. Youthful optimism and social reality are at odds as seen through the young Billy (a very talented Jamie Bell) and the film doesn't let either one completely win out, an admirable and unexpected quality for a story about a child.Pre-teen Billy lives in a small England town where his father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are picketing as part of the coal miner's strike, so money is scarce. His father then becomes especially angry to find out Billy's been taking the money he was supposed to be using to pay for boxing lessons for ballet instruction instead. Despite his father's disapproval at his son taking up a ""girl's"" activity, Billy meets regularly with Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) to prepare for the Royal Ballet School audition.The feature film debut for both writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry, ""Billy Elliot"" is a real triumph of art imitating life. In a stroke of inspired creativity, Billy dances when he feels it, when he needs to express emotions of anger or excitement or when he was something to prove. Scenes are intercut often to show how Billy's drive to master ballet is indicative of a need for self-discovery, family approval and learning how to handle life's challenges.With a soundtrack mixing '70s English rock band T-Rex with classical music and orchestration by 1999 Oscar-winning composer Stephen Warbeck, ""Billy Elliot"" takes on this true independent spirit. It's far from the cheesy uplifting string music of an inspirational drama and more true to its historical context. Its much easier to sympathize with Billy's yearning for movement and his description of ""electricity"" in terms of how dance makes him feel with modern music.Billy's dancing outburst scenes give the film the feel of a dance musical movie ala the Fred Astaire era of Hollywood, while his angry and emotionally withdrawn father as well as Billy's own fits of irrational anger ground the movie in the struggles that surround the Elliot family on a daily basis. The film is also not a social commentary on gender roles despite the conflict of Billy wanting to dance and his father wanting him to box. Billy takes an unexplained interest in dancing and doesn't exhibit any ""homosexual"" tendencies. This is about doing something you're passionate about, not a child's struggle with his gender identity. Billy's cross-dressing friend is there to remind us that one thing is not connected to the other, but the film doesn't waste time overdramatizing this small conflict in a greater story.""Billy Elliot"" is a special film, one that perfectly fits the magic of finding one's passion within the troubles of real life and a cast that accurately reflects that vision from Daldry and Hall. It acknowledges that with good comes bad and with reward and hard work comes nervousness and discomfort. It's a unique outlook for a movie based about a young boy and his dreams. ~ Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Billy Elliot
27,dfranzen70,Skip the last dance,5,27 April 2001,"An 11-year old boy from a working-class British family is torn between his desire to learn ballet and his father's wish for him to learn boxing. Billy's father is headstrong and medieval in his worldly outlook, as he only wants manly things for his son. But Billy sees something more in the poetry of ballet, and he wants more than anything else to be as fluid and graceful as those sinewy dancers.   Having established the conflict of the story from the outset, the movie takes us through Billy's struggles to complete his ballet training privately (under the tutelage of Mrs. Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters). It's a great idea for a movie, really, because of the stark contrast between the outside world of Billy's neighborhood (which exists under the spectre of an ominous protracted workers' strike, of which Billy's father participates) and the inner workings of Billy's decidedly unmanly mind. However, the film is hit or miss. If the viewer allows himself or herself to become fully wrapped up in Billy's predicament, much as one would approach a soap opera, then one will fall for this unabashed schmaltz-fest with no problems. But for the more cynical among us, the movie fails in that it plays out virtually every Hollywood cliche imaginable; the only true original notion in the movie is the basic ""boy wants to be a ballet dancer"" ideal. Here are some tried-and-true portions of the movie: Boy wants to do something against dad's wishes. Boy's dad is a tough-as-nails cretin, stolidly stupid but somewhere, deep inside, he loves his boy. Then there's the unforgiving teacher (Mr. Miyagi, anyone?). And the Impossible Dream. The list goes on and one. When I first popped this in the ol' DVD player, I accidentally set it to play in French (at least I think that's what that was...) Then I stopped it and switched the settings. Guess what? The overwrought Cockney accents are, at times, absolutely indecipherable. It's like watching a foreign film, only not as full of deep meaning.   In short, this can be a real snorefest if you're not ready to become one with the plight of poor Master Elliot. If you are, more power to you; time for you to dust off that old copy of Love Story. But if you're like the rest of us, skip it unless you're suffering from sleep deprivation.",Billy Elliot

The Third Way,Non-Judgementalism,Inclusivism,Moral Equivalence,One Nationism,every cliché of the Limp Left,every slightly pathetic belief of the ""It's grim oop North London"" brigade is regurgitated in this fairy (no offence) story about a little boy who'd rather be a ballet dancer than have his brains scrambled in the boxing ring.

29,meeza,Good But Not For All The Billing It Has Received,7,24 November 2000,"`Billy Elliot' is the newest british import billed to us. It is a pretty good one. The movie is about an 11 year old british lad who becomes fascinated with the art of ballet. Billy lives in a mining town with an abusive father, a selfish brother, and a zany grandmother. I guess that is enough for any young lad to go cookoo and put on a tutu. Newcomer Jamie Bell is definitely no acting `ding dong.' He just might dance away with an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Also, Julie Walters, who plays the chain smoking ballet instructor, might just waltz away with a Best Supporting Actress nomination herself. `Billy Elliot' did have a few falls though. For example, its concentration on the mining strike definitely did not strike it rich it to my liking. All in all, `Billy Elliot' is one that is worth a few bills to spend on and go check out. *** Average",Billy Elliot
30,FilmCriticLalitRao,Jamie Bell and Julie Walters show us a very British vision of the world of dance.,6,28 January 2009,"Billy Elliot is a film for those people who have faced or face problems in choosing what is good for them.Young minds are at a loss to decide for themselves as they have neither knowledge nor experience to opt for whatever that is good for them.For them, it is not so easy to make a choice as there are times when they have to take into consideration the feeling of others around them.This is some kind of a universal phenomenon but for most young boys it is sometimes difficult to choose dance instead of boxing.This might be because boxing is a symbol of strong male character whereas dance is mostly associated with feminine world.This is precisely the case in the life of our film's young protagonist named Billy Elliot.With this film British director Stephen Daldry has succeeded in revealing the feminine aspects of young boys. The best lesson one can learn from this film is that one should strive to achieve what one has in mind instead of crumbling under pressure. Billy Elliot is a fine film which will surely appeal to all but it has also its share of some minor glitches.The fact that it is too British might be seen as an impediment for those viewers who crave for universal themes without any notion of national identity.",Billy Elliot
31,Chris_Docker,Dancing into your heart and soul,7,29 August 2000,"For me, easily the most enjoyable film of the Edinburgh International Film Festival (though there might have been others as good which I couldn't get tickets for). It is the story of a young boy's struggle to become a ballet dancer against a working class background (set against the Miners' Strike, a single parent family and a violent father who initially reacts to his son's aspirations with accusations of homosexuality).

Everything there makes you truly care for the titular character.Billy is played by Jamie Bell, who gives a fantastic performance. Julie Walters is great too, portraying Sandra. Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven are also notable for their work here, even if their characters are a little too one-dimensional for the majority.The plot is terrific and told in a superb way, with impressive cinematography. The only thing I'm not sold on is the dialogue, which is odd in parts; particularly with Billy and Debbie (Nicola Blackwell). I appreciate they don't patronise the children, but it's too far the other way with some of the speech; too forced to sound like an adult.Nonetheless, it's a brilliant film and one you should definitely watch.",Billy Elliot
33,noralee,Being Different Amidst Dark Times Can Be Joyous,10,19 December 2005,"I went to ""Billy Elliott"" feeling suspicious of the rave reviews, saying, like Natalie Wood in ""Miracle on 34th St."": ""Yeah, yeah, I believe, I know it's silly but I believe."" My gosh, the reviews were right -- this is not a schmaltzy just feel good movie. It's even better then ""Brassed Off"" as a working-class-and-the-arts-movie. It reminded me of my favorite scene in King Vidor's ""Our Daily Bread"": ""Your contribution to the group will be giving violin lessons to our children."" (chokes me up every time I see that).The emotion is ratcheted up here because the miners are in the middle of the doomed anti-Thatcher strikes and the dancing kid is simply incredible. The story is told visually through his face, body language amidst the different pressures he's caught between, and that irrepressible dancing (though not comparable to be in Oscar contention vs. non-dancing adults). This isn't just about working class attitudes towards ballet and gays; their political and financial struggles are real, putting their bodies on the line for their solidarity and economic future.In the midst of being ""unfulfilled,"" as even the middle class representatives are, is one kid's glimmer of something inconceivable--being different. And what that means in every way to every person who knows, and loves, him.The music's a surprise -- mostly T. Rex and the Clash.(originally written 11/5/2000)",Billy Elliot

The plot is nothing new but the execution is fantastic and I was glad to be in Billy's world for ninety minutes.All of the acting is great but Julie Walters stands out and should get an Oscar nomination, at the very least.

38,adamjohns-42575,Billy is a hero.,9,7 January 2021,"I have always enjoyed this film. Whenever I watch it I love it and I come away feeling a bit awed by it, but I tend to put off watching it because the main bulk of it is really quite hard. It's such a shame to see the life that poor Billy goes through and it's films like this that really show how important the arts are to kids and how access should be easier for everyone.
I think the tough life he has though is not all for nought here, as we reach the climax and that fantastic piece of music builds before we see Billy leap in to the air.That instant is a superb moment in film history akin to Darth Maul revealing his double-ender in 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'. The power of the music building and building to finally provide the relief we have all craved throughout the film is so awesome. It brings tears to my eyes every time and I get really quite emotional about every tiny thing going on in that moment.The story is your typical 1980's mining town tale with similarities to 'The Full Monty' and 'Pride'. A no frills, warts and all, gritty production.
Amidst that, we see Billy's struggle to be something others don't think he should be. His brother doesn't appreciate his gift and with his father they are both wrapped up in the issue surrounding their jobs, while dear little Billy takes care of his Grandma and grieves for his Mum.
There is a lot of passion throughout about many things and the performances by all of the cast are very well done. Gary Lewis is just fantastic as Billy's Dad and the little boy who plays his best friend is adorable.It really is incredible to see how many films Jamie Bell has gone on to make since. A hard worker and this film is no exception. I couldn't have performed like that at 14 and I certainly can't now.What I also like about it, is that it doesn't make a fuss about Billy having the potential to become a part of the LGBT community or his friend Michael's hobbies either, especially as at the time and in that place, it would have been a huge no-no. I'm glad that they didn't do much about it, because I think it would have detracted from the main story.Considering it's low budget, it really gets the scene across well and supplies a fantastic soundtrack to go with it.It's your standard working mans film. A snapshot of a tough life in a tough town during the miners strikes of the 80's, out of which a star shines.",Billy Elliot

Cinematography is great, it is perfectly edited, actors do an amazing job (Jamie Bell is awesome in the leading role, but how not to also highlight Gary Lewis's performance as his father, or Julie Walters's as his ballet teacher, or Jean Heywood's as grandma?). It is much more than a dance film, as people usually refer themselves to it.

I disliked it then but as time goes on and you grow up I thought I would find some appreciation for it. It didn't happen, in fact, I see further frustrations in this mediocre and terrible film. While it may be grounded in realism, the story and setting of rural England does not make good story telling or directing. It is a painful experience to watch a boring child who hails from an even more boring family and town try and be a ballet dancer. The story was so bland and dull and none of the acting performances really stand out. The funny thing is this film could have been made beautifully. Directors have done wonders with less interesting stories through good directing, symbolism, storytelling and soundtrack. This was a horrible and terrible mess.

42,JuguAbraham,Can it stand up to the best of British cinema of the 60s?,8,2 April 2003,"Stephen Daldry is to be admired. For a first film by a theater director it is a commendable product that brings out fascinating performances that only theatre directors are adept at ensuring. Admirable performances by Julie Walters and Jamie Bell. Add to it clever and tongue-in-cheek editing by John Wilson and imaginative camerawork by Brian Tufano.All this reminded me of three films from Britain made in the sixties: Karel Reiz' ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", Tony Richardson's ""Loneliness of the long distance runnner"", and Lindsay Anderson's ""This sporting life"". These movies captured exactly the same feelings as ""Billy Elliot""--the only difference was Billy is younger. ""Billy Elliot"" is in color, while the three brilliant films of the 60s were in black and white. Two of the movies were based on work by the superb writer Alan Sillitoe, who I was lucky to have met in real life, whose middle-class characters wanted to break away and become achievers in their own cosmic world--without the angry tap dances of ""Billy Elliot"" to aid them on the technicolor screen. The three movies of the 60s established the careers of the late Richard Harris, Rachel Roberts, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, and the late Lindsay Anderson--another giant I was fortunate to have met and interviewed.""Billy Elliot"" touches your heart because it is a great story and has so much of creative talent packed into it. Yet compare this film to the three British films made forty years ago, with older technology, but brimming with a passion that dwarfs ""Billy Elliot"" in all its color and technical glory. The politics, the social commentary and human values of the three 60s movies are more gripping than the saccharin sweet ""Billy Elliot"" made 40 years later. I do not infer that Stephen Daldry is less talented than Anderson, Richardson or Reisz--only that the movie needs to be compared and evaluated with its true elder cousins.",Billy Elliot
43,screenman,Kes With Tights.,7,10 August 2008,"Set against the disastrous miner's strike of the 1980's (unless you were a policeman on over-time pay), we find young Billy Elliot. He is too much of a kid to grasp the enormity of social and political issues. He is an observer. Things happen around him and implode upon his family life.But he definitely has no desire to go down t'pit. His sights are set elsewhere - as a dancer.In the steadfast working-class world of coal-mines, pubs and self-respect, nothing could be more out of place or less macho than dancing. Something for posh girls, perhaps, but certainly not working-class boys. Ballet? It's the stuff of pansies.The conflict between the two extremes is almost a cliché in itself. But we can let that pass because it is sublimely acted, and the contrast between Billy's aspirations and the turmoil of the times is realised with heart-rending authenticity.What is disappointing is that the movie appears to confirm the prevailing prejudice by actually casting Billy as a homosexual. It's as if all of those gruff, bluff voices at the working-men's clubs have collectively announced 'Thar - I tou'd thee so!' Perhaps many dancers are homosexual. But it doesn't follow that all homosexuals want to be dancers. It may also be that most ballet dancers in particular have what might be called 'an ambiguous sexual identity', but this movie tends to underscore the prejudice as a presumption. In doing so it over-simplifies Billy Elliot's dilemma by associating his desire to dance with emergent homosexuality. Life is not always that straightforward. And I personally think greater depth would have been lent to his character if he had been portrayed as a heterosexual youth coming to terms with an urge to dance whilst at the same time having to confront all of the contrarian elements of his inherent masculinity and expectations of manliness. Scripting him as 'gay' might have been politically-correct, but it glosses-over what could have been much more complex drama by suggesting it as an explanation in itself.In 1970, we saw another young Billy in the movie 'Kes'. It was filmed and acted in a much more understated way which - although offering a less dramatic take on life, and therefore often dismissed as 'boring' by those not born of Yorkshire stock - nevertheless offers a more authentic view of life as it was 'oop north' in the days of the pit.'Kes' is also more realistic because his family are neither enlightened nor supportive. Although he craves escape as much as his later namesake, we all know that there is no hope for him. The mine will surely swallow him up (though 13 years later he'll be out on strike).Billy Elliot, then, is very much 'Kes' revisited. Where Billy was left in 1970, alone, neglected, hopeless and cradling a dead kestrel; this time our hero is spared his dismal fate and given opportunity and hope. It's a feel-good movie with a happy ending. But it seems bogus for all of that. How many miner's sons become ballet dancers? I'll stick with 'Kes'. It's grim, but at least it's 'true'.",Billy Elliot
44,LeonardKniffel,"Beautifully Done, Don't Miss This One",9,1 May 2020,"A young boy in a remote coal-mining town discovers his love for ballet, much to the dismay of his hardened father and brother who are striking members of a labor union. This is not a musical per se; it's a movie about a dancer who succeeds against all odds. Billy Elliot-played brilliantly by Jamie Bell-is supposed to learn to box but secretly chooses ballet with the girls. The film is unsentimental and inspiring especially when Billy finally dances in front of his father and the old man loosens up. Billy describes how dancing feels to him: ""I feel a change in my whole body. And I've got this fire in my body. I'm just there. Flying like a bird. Like electricity."" The music score is brilliantly chosen and ranges from T. Rex to Tchaikovsky. This is the original (released under the title Dancer) that inspired a musical version of the film in England in 2005 that led to the Broadway production, which cost $18 million to produce, over three times as much as the original film's budget.

45,Sergeant_Tibbs,Surprisingly and pleasantly cinematic. It's a shame it's so rushed.,7,10 July 2013,"I remember when this came out and the adults around me were crazy about it. Unfortunately, I was only aware of the negative reputation the film had, I didn't realize this was a much grittier social commentary. The centrepiece of Billy Elliot are the performances, Jamie Bell is especially impressive for his age and perfectly expresses anguish and frustration. Julie Walters is charming and her scenes with Bell are a delight but the true underrated star is Gary Lewis, Billy's Dad, whose subtle performance is fascinating and incredible. It's a film with great production design too, as though Ken Loach went to Hollywood. Unfortunately, its problems lie with the screenplay, with rushed and brief development and a few too many montages. It struggles to establish things properly and develop things. When Billy was finally doing ballet, I didn't understand why, and it was a moment they saved for the climax that should have come to light immediately. It does have a few great movie magic moments as Billy defiantly dances in front of his father, but once his father came to believe in Billy, there felt little left to resolve to escalate on top of that. It does have a great soundtrack though, awesome use of ""London Calling."" Still better than I expected.7/10",Billy Elliot

Two miners, father and son fight for a better life for themselves and their family while the youngest member of that same family dreams of becoming a dancer. That means also a hard fight for himself, against his own family to begin with. In the end life meets art. For ever. This movie is really beautiful and moving and shows us that even on a mount of stones a flower grows sometimes. All the actors involved have excellent performances chiefly the young Jamie Bell in the main role.",Billy Elliot
47,frankde-jong,A late kitchen sink movie,7,24 May 2020,"In the end of the 50's and the beginning of the 60's there was a wave of ""Kitchen sink"" films in England. These films are set in a working-class environment and are often located in Northern England. Not only are working man the main protagonists in these films, the film often also takes their side. Laborers are seen as the victims of the capitalist system. Important directors are Tony Richardson (""Look back in anger"" (1959) and ""A taste of honey"" (1961)) and Lindsay Anderson (""This sporting life"", (1963)).In the '80s the Thatcher era seems to provide a vertile soil for Kitchen sink type of movies, but only a director as Stephen Frears made them. Today, in the gig economy, we have Ken Loach who is still going strong with movies such as ""Sorry, we missed you"" (2019) and ""I, Daniel Blake"" (2016).Stephan Daldry (""The Reader"", 2008) is not a typical ""Kitchen sink"" director and he made his film about the England of Margaret Thatcher only in 2000. Nevertheless ""Billy Elliot"" is a kitchen sink film, and not a bad one. It plays in Northern England in 1984. It is the time of the coal mine strikes (Arthur Scargill versus Margaret Thatcher). There are beautiful images of industrial landscapes and working class neighborhoods.One of the strongest points of ""Billy Elliot"" is that it has a working class setting, but it does not idealize the characters (as Ken Loach tends to do in the above mentioned pictures). They are not only honest people who are the victims of a cruel system, they have faults of their own. In ""Billy Elliot"" there is a macho culture, in which introverted people with an unusual hobby not always have an easy life. Billy's preference of ballet above boxing is frowned upon by his father and his older brother.The struggle of Billy in defence of his passion makes for a fascinating picture. The U-turn the character of his father makes towards the (happy) end is however not entirely credible. In my opinion this is the weak spot of this movie. Ken Loach, whom I accused of idealizing laborers in ""Sorry, we missed you"" and ""I, Daniel Blake"", did a better job in ""Kes"" (1969).",Billy Elliot
48,antoniotierno,heartwarming and charming,9,26 March 2005,"It's absolutely undeniable that Jamie Bell has greatly acted and delivered a very charismatic performance, evoking laughters and tears at the same time; Billy Elliot works his way up to success after giving through the hardest times and situations a child could live in. Compared to other pictures shot in the Eighties and showing English plights of those years, this melodrama is better conceived and more engrossing for the way it tells of family life and dreams coming true. With everything considered it's genuinely intense and soulful, narrating emotions, changes and above all a story of struggle: struggle with losses of life, with biases, with public authorities and with sexuality.",Billy Elliot
49,blott2319-1,Totally enjoyable with some flaws,7,13 February 2021,"Billy Elliott is a movie that has a tone which matches the main character quite well. It feels free-wheeling, fun-loving, and not afraid to embrace its passion. However, there are also moments when it has to buckle down, and deal with the harshness of real life. I was fully on board for the journey this film would take me on, and I think it has a lot of familiar movie tropes that are handled quite well. One of my favorite aspects of this movie is the way it handles world-building and general plot setup. They don't spend any time detailing the history of the strike that affects Billy's family. It's just surrounding everything that happens, and so instead of watching kids walk to school, we see them wander through a line of picketing workers, or some police in riot gear. Since this later becomes a key element of the plot, the fact that they establish these things is essential, but it's not handled with clunky exposition (or lazy voiceover.)Jamie Bell plays the charming young Billy Elliott, and I found him completely relatable. I like the way they show his passion for dancing even if his technique isn't perfect. I kind of wish we could have seen a dance in full, because it often felt like we were just getting snippets of his performances. But even in those short moments, you can sense the love that he has for the art. This film felt like it had a strange way of addressing the topic of homosexuality, though. Naturally it's going to come up, because a conservative community of miners are quick to shun any activity that might seem too feminine for one of their boys. It does seem like this is talked about to some degree, but then the subject is dropped rather abruptly. Plus, they shove in the character of Michael, as if they want to make it clear they don't have anything against alternative lifestyles even if they did imply that being a ""poof"" was a negative. It's just a little clumsy, but I suppose they tried. Aside from some minor issues like that, I found Billy Elliott to be a charming film, and it makes me want to see the Broadway musical version.",Billy Elliot
50,kevin c,BEST OF BRITISH ??,5,3 October 2000,"Misunderstood northern boy who finds an outlet in an unlikely subject. Hang on a minute that was done in ""Kes"", and better for it too. An unashamed crowd-pleaser, and very much a woman's film. It all resolves itself far too quickly and neatly. Entertaining multiplex fodder, but certainly not as good as it's been painted.",Billy Elliot
51,mattymatt4ever,"Moving, funny and entertaining!",7,5 July 2001,"""Billy Elliot"" is nice, uplifting piece that doesn't take cheap shots.  The arc is quite obvious, but it's the way the film works towards that arc which I found impressive.  First of all, I'd like to say that I assumed I'd be watching a family film.  I ignored the R-rating, assuming it was on a technicality.  But this film really is filled with harsh language!  However, I didn't sweat it, because that was the film's way of capturing the realism of its characters.  The characters in the story are low-class, blue-collar citizens and naturally they're not going to have the cleanest vocabulary. 
The performances are great all-around.  Of course, the two highlights are Julie Walters and Gary Lewis.  Walters is electric as the possessive but good-natured ballet teacher.  I haven't seen ""Pollock"" yet, so I can't say if she would've deserved to win over Marcia Gay Harden, but I can say she definitely deserved to be nominated.  I also wish the Academy considered Lewis, who is powerful as Billy's overbearing father.  It strikes fear in me just by observing the look in his eyes.  His father-son interactions with Billy (Jamie Bell) are extremely powerful, and I love the chemistry between them.  They interact the way a REAL father and son would act, and not how a tailor-made, cinematic father and son would act.  The film is set in 1984, so I was bopping my head to some cool 80s tunes. Aside from the dramatic scenes, ""Billy Elliot"" has a very upbeat feel and makes you want to smile.  It's funny, it's entertaining, yet moving at the same time.  Though it tries to be uplifting, it never forgets its dark subplots like the coal-miners strike and the loss of Billy's mother who he, in one scene, imagines in the kitchen with him.  ""Billy Elliot"" is a fine, fine film that inspires its audience to follow their dreams, and deliver it in a way that's unpretentious, down to earth, not sappy and something we can all relate to.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Billy Elliot
52,rupie,simply superb,8,8 June 2001,"It is a crime that this movie didn't get an Academy Award. You don't have to be a ballet fan to be enthralled by this story of a poverty-stricken kid in a grungy Welsh mining town who completely by chance becomes enthralled by the world of dance, and to his instructor's amazement and his father's and brother's dismay, has the talent and ambition to want to go all the way with it. The movie is really about the triumph of the spirit and about family love and sacrifice. It's a beautiful, yes even uplifting and inspiring film. The kid who plays Billy does an absolutely phenomenal job, way beyond his years. Don't miss it (caveat: the accents are a bit thick, and it is essential to the plot to know that the word ""pouf"", used a lot here, is analogous in the UK to our degrading American terms ""fag"" or ""queer""). This is a film that will last through the years.",Billy Elliot
53,phubbs,Billy Elliot,9,19 February 2014,"The film that started it all...well for this particular franchise/story that is. One of many films that has become a great success and followed on with even greater success as a musical theatrical production. I think this film may have been one of the first to kick start that trend as it were, can't quite remember.The tale of a humble miners son whose aspirations to become a male ballet dancer are frowned upon by his blue collar father and similar blue collar brother. Set in north eastern England around 1984-85 during the miners strikes against a powerful Thatcher led Conservative regime...errr I mean government. Billy is destined to become a miner like his older brother and father and is pretty much forced to take part in boxing at school by his father. His dad obviously wants more for his boy with the possibility of boxing but he knows the pit beckons.On the other hand Billy discovers his love for dancing in ballet and wants to follow that path. Naturally this disgusts his strong proud father and gets him into trouble for disobeying. The whole plot could be the tale of many many northern born men within England at any point in time really. I have lived up north in the UK and it can indeed be a bit bleak with little job prospects for youngsters (no offence to the north). The whole film is one big stereotype really, but a very real and truthful stereotype. Billy's tough working father is a typical northern bloke who likes beer boxing and a good plate of drippin' sandwiches. The area they live in is of course very working class with small terrace housing along steep hills and flatcaps everywhere and the general attitude of all the men is somewhat old fashioned. Boys partake in football rugby and boxing, girls do ballet and sewing, there is no middle ground...dare I say homophobia is lightly touched upon too.I am exaggerating yes? well not really, as I said I've lived up north for many years and in some areas this is exactly what its like to this day. Thinking back to 1984-85 it would have been ten times worse!.The main crux of the story is Billy's struggle against 'the norm' and his fathers rules. He wants to be a ballet dancer, his school dance teacher thinks he's good enough but the money isn't there to fund it any further and his father hates the fact his boy might be a sissy. I think many people will be able to relate to this story as I said, but not just with dancing, with many areas. The scenes where Billy fights against his dad are naturally emotionally strong and really hooked me. There are many scenes where Billy gets into trouble by playing with his homosexual friend whom he doesn't understand is homosexual, not going to boxing lessons, going to ballet lessons and the intense strike sequences which are all terrifically acted out and really sucked me into the moment.The moments of spontaneous dance from Billy are really cool to watch, I really found myself wanting to dance too, yeah maybe I can do what Billy does!. Every character is wonderfully portrayed, Bell is a little bit too full of himself at times, a bit too eager to please by over acting perhaps but he's certainly fun to watch. The only character I thought was maybe a bit off was Billy's dad played by Gary Lewis. I really thought this character needed to be much harsher, stricter, he was tough but I didn't really fear him or his rule. I'm not saying there should have been nasty beatings but he just didn't sell the gruff northerner aspect to me despite the fact he's Scottish. I think the fact he is actually Scottish (and in the film it seems) means he doesn't have the REAL English northerner spirit inside him, unlike a real Geordie, Yorkshireman, Mackem etc...The build up to the finale is quite moving and did pull on my heart strings I can't deny. Its all very cliché but it damn well works...damn it!. The whole notion of anyone trying to simply make their father/mother proud by their good actions or dedication to something is a warm path to tread and guaranteed hanky dampener at the movies. Again many will be able to relate to the lovely final curtain sequence as Billy finally shows his family what he has achieved, it does put a lump in your throat and made me wish I could do the same with my own father.I think you will get more out of this film being British and knowing of the north south divide and stereotypical views within the UK. I think if you live up north then you will certainly know the vibe this film gives off and will be able to relate and hopefully enjoy. It can be a feel good film but at the same time it can also be a slightly depressing film on various aspects...the miners strikes, being on the breadline, the grim north and being a youngster trying to break out of a situation. In the end the film is a joy to watch and should leave you upbeat. I hope I have not upset any of my northern countrymen, my dad is a Yorkshireman born n bred so I have experience ^_^9/10",Billy Elliot
54,gbheron,Effective,8,15 May 2002,"""Billy Eliott"", as everyone knows, is a straightforward, feel-good movie. It can be thought of as a cross between ""Breaking Away"" (young working class kids overcoming adversity for their love of sport) and ""The Full Monty"" (the working class is English). Personally, I like this type of film. If it works, you are inspired and leave the theater with a tear in the eye. If they fail, they're a hoot.  ""Billy Eliott"" is one that works. You root for young Billy: to overcome the disapproval of his family and neighbors, to rise above the poverty, and to succeed and dance his way into the hearts of a grateful England. Okay, maybe not like that. ""Billy Eliott"" also has some depth; central characters are more thoroughly drawn. The father who is torn between his deep love for his son, and his visceral dislike of his young son's desire to be a dancer.  He's also involved in a lengthy and bitter labor strike that leaves the family strapped for cash. And there is the older brother following in the father's footsteps, and the elderly grandmother with dementia. It's not a great film, but a very effective film. You can't go wrong for a ""good for the whole family"" rental.",Billy Elliot
55,stamper,Pretty good,7,3 April 2002,"The story of this film was quite good, as was the execution, but the best thing about this film have to be the characters portrayed by the children actors (Michael and Billy in the film). They both were brilliant and made this film what it was. Another thing that really astounded me, was how much 25 year old Michael resembled 'young' Michael. Solid, though not GREAT.7 out of 10",Billy Elliot
56,rbrb,A Star Is Born,8,20 April 2001,This is an excellent film... This movie is not really about dance or ballet... its about trying to understand what it was like to be a striking miner in the North of England in the 1980's and supporting your children to pursue their dreams.... Sure there is dance in the film......the kid is cute and talented... but the real star is the actor playing his father giving a magnificant performance..... All the actors do well but the formentioned is stunning ....and this film can make you laugh and cry ..and is worth at least an 8 out of 10.,Billy Elliot
57,TheNorthernMonkee,clever British story with some superb performances,6,17 January 2005,"SPOILERS For many years now, there's been some negative assumptions about the Ballet. For all the criticism though, ballet remains one of Britain's most popular art forms. Part of this might be down to the success of 2000's ""Billy Elliot"". With some superb performances and an excellent soundtrack, this film remains entertaining from start to finish.In the North of England, people were suffering during the Miner Strikes. For reasons too complicated to go into, communities were divided as people's lives were destroyed. In this living hell, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is living with his own problems. Loosing his mother at a young age, Elliot fails to really communicate with his father (Gary Lewis) and elder brother (Jamie Draven). One day though, Elliot discovers a surprising passion, ballet.From the offset, ""Billy Elliot"" attempts to tug at the heart strings. Introducing us to the mother's gravestone almost straight away, the film does try too hard at times. The irony is that whilst intentional moments don't click, there are moments when the film relaxes itself and these moments are the finest parts. Scenes where Billy's father reaches breaking point are in particularly brilliant.As Billy's father, Gary Lewis is a revolution. Whilst Bell might have won all the awards, Lewis is absolutely breathtaking as the miner, angry with life. With a full range of emotion the character connects on so many levels with the audience and irrelevant of whatever mistakes he makes, we never stop feeling for him.Aside from Bell & Lewis, others perform admirably in this film. Julie Walters as Billy's instructor is great, as is Draven as his elder brother. In fact, child and adult alike, there is not one bad performance in the entire film.Perhaps the best thing about ""Billy Elliot"" is it's soundtrack. With classics from bands like T-Rex and The Clash, it sounds like a pub jukebox album.Whilst not as amazing as is often claimed, ""Billy Elliot"" remains an acting masterclass. With some stunning performances and a powerful script, this film is well worth watching. Add an excellent soundtrack too, and there are aspects to please everyone.",Billy Elliot
58,LeRoyMarko,Loved it!,9,13 April 2001,"This movie was very enjoyable to watch. It was moving, touching and funny.

59,AngelHonesty,Widely Over Rated,6,16 January 2020,"The film is very slow and lower budget. I do like the idea of the story, it's entertaining to watch a struggling kid fight to dance; but the way it was written/depicted was very boring and slightly weird. Not to mention that this is a British film, the actors have very heavy accents making it difficult to understand if you're not used to the British language. I enjoyed the dancing scenes and wished they would have had more of Billy dancing. The one nice thing about the film was the ending; I find the movie finally started to pick up a bit at the end, leaving you with a decent feeling when the film was over.",Billy Elliot
60,Pedro_H,Plodding low budget drama about music and dreams - that was a surprise world hit.,6,2 April 2005,"Billy is a normal young kid from a normal 1980's mining town in the North East of England. However he finds that he prefers dancing to being hit on the nose at the local boxing club! It says a lot about how poor modern cinema is that this bit of kitchen sink fluff took off and became a hit. The budget is obviously so low that even the real life props look fake! I don't know who ordered the ""period"" 1984 cars - but they shouldn't be in a job.The plot is borrowed from every girls-only magazine published since the 1960's where the plucky little miss ""wants to be a ballerina, but her mother won't let her."" Only they have swapped the sexes around. Talk about old wine in new bottles.There is nothing worse than not being charmed when all around you there are people that are. It is like being at a party and watching people get drunk, dance and kissing girls while you look on - long faced - from the corner. The general audience should be grateful that they don't know the North East, because if they did they would realise it is only a plastic version of it. It seems more like Yorkshire to me - but then I know these places better than most.The use of endless four letters words - while not unrealistic - doesn't make it any more real and cuts across the point of the exercise. Who is the thing aimed at if not kids. Why shut people of Billy's age out? The thing measures out equal doses of dance, music, black comedy and social realism with a light gay undertone that I don't really understand. There isn't the depth and script to understand it. It looks like a bolt-on to try and sell it to gay audiences.The sideline acting is vary passable apart from Julie Walters who clunks around in a boiler suit looking like a baby elephant. Is this supposed to be funny? Who knows. Someone, somewhere told the world that this woman has some kind of special talent - and the world seem to have gone along with it.(Don't get me wrong - she can act a bit, but seems to pop up like bad penny in every Brit pic ever made.) Naturally people evolve and change their opinion to become better and more rounded people - because that is what people do in movies. Billy is only made a loser so that he can be transformed in to a winner before our eyes.Lead Jamie Bell seems a nice enough kid though - it will be interesting to see if he is anything more than a flash in the pan though. Despite being star of the show here it takes more to make it in showbiz than a bit of cod Irish dancing - the fact is that I thought his footwork was strictly chorus material.",Billy Elliot
61,rebeljenn,Over-rated,3,13 November 2005,"Although it has its moments and is an inspiring film with excellent performances, Billy Elliott fails to captivate and convince. Although the performances were convincing, it was difficult to relate to the characters. Overall, Billy Elliott is grossly over-rated and emotional, but it does carry a good message that people should use their talents and do what makes them happy in self-fulfillment...even if they risk being ridiculed because what they enjoy is not mainstream or conventional. At best, it's average. It's got a very good message, but it just failed to really go that extra bit to be a really great film. 3/10.",Billy Elliot
62,tonypeacock-1,Film instantly evoked memories of Ken Loach,7,23 June 2019,"As the title of this review suggests this film quickly evoked comparisons to your typical Ken Loach film.Directed by Stephen Daldry it follows the highly unlikely topic of ballet in a 1984 County Durham mining village in Northern England amidst the backdrop of the miners strike of the time.That is one typical Loach trait. The left leaning political climate of the film.
The second is the older brother character to the lead Billy Elliot. It reminded me a little of the Jud character in the classic film Kes.The plot concerns a young boy who instead of following the usual route of the local boxing gym ends up being taught ballet by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters).I have never been disappointed with a Walters performance to be fair. She just has this comedic, down to earth manner.The film has an excellent soundtrack from the 1970s vinyl of the Elliot family, a bit of The Clash and 'London Calling'.The film was the springboard for the acting career of a young Jamie Bell in the title role of Billy Elliot.
A commercial success leading to spin offs such as the customary musical show.",Billy Elliot
63,perfectbond,Very moving drama,8,12 February 2004,"I appreciated the dramatic aspects of this film more than the comic but they mesh together nicely on the whole. The whole film felt very realistic and plausible and not glossily manufactured like most Hollywood productions. Perhaps that's because it's British. The youngster who played the title character was also marvel, having to not only possess that singular accent but also be able to act and dance. The rest of the cast is also very strong in their roles. Good movie, 8/10.",Billy Elliot

The other is the reality at home of a father miner, a ""machismo"" typical of Latin American countries prevailing in that society, which is supposedly more advanced culturally and economically than Latin America. Against the vocation of children is very little what parents can do, and Billy is the prove, he insisted on and persuaded his father and even his extreme conservative brother to leave him become a ballet dancer, and he succeeded.",Billy Elliot
65,raymond-15,An inspiring climb to fame against all odds,8,25 March 2002,"Persistence wins through for young Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) when he auditions for entry into the Royal Ballet School.  Throughout his young life Billy is spurned by his father who physically abuses him, declaring that ""boys do boxing....sport....wrestling....not f****** ballet.""  But dancing is in Billy's veins.  Encouraged by his local chain-smoking ballet teacher (Julie Walters) he gradually gains the necessary confidence at his weekly ballet classes.The film gives you a nice warm feeling as Billy in his triumphant moments dances in the streets in sheer joy.  There are some splendid contrasts in the film as it cuts from angry-faced striking coal miners to gentle ballet classes and soft fluffy tutus.The music and dancing lifts the rather depressing atmosphere of this north England mining town where workers are losing their jobs, but it is by no means a ""musical"".The final scene of ""Swan Lake"" fills you with pride and satisfaction.I found only one drawback to the film.  I was not able to comprehend a lot of the dialogue.  I would like to have had the movie sub-titled.If you have ever experienced an audition and performed in front of a selection committee, you will appreciate the feelings of a young boy striving to attain the seemingly impossible.  His earnest persistence unites the members of his family.An inspiring film, well worth watching for the sheer joy of it.",Billy Elliot
66,MattyGibbs,Excellent,9,12 March 2013,"A story about a boy ballet dancer sounds about as appealing as a 25 year stretch in prison. However it didn't take long for this film to win me round. Jamie Bell is simply outstanding as the would be boy ballet dancer ( and has proved this performance was no fluke with later film efforts). Julie Walters as his teacher is also excellent as are the rest of the talented British cast. The plot is pretty straight forward and you always know what is coming next but this film is always entertaining with some wonderfully blunt and funny scenes. As with any good film this film is just as entertaining the second, third and fourth time you watch it as the first.It may take a bit of a stereotypical view of Northern British men and Northern life in general but it is a film and I didn't find this was detrimental to the film. This is a wonderful feel good drama that can be watched by all ages even children way below the ridiculous 15 rating.",Billy Elliot
67,Isaac5855,"Experience the Joy and the ""Electricity""",8,3 July 2008,"BILLY ELLIOTT is an enchanting and exuberant film that celebrates the joy and the passion of dance and how it can infuse anyone. Not since FOOTLOOSE has a film so beautifully captured the passion and joy that can be experienced from the art of the dance. Billy is an ll-year old Irish boy who lives with his widowed father and older brother, who both work as coal miners. Billy is taking boxing lessons at a local gym but inexplicably finds himself drawn to a ballet class that is being taught on the other side of the gym and after taking a couple of classes, Billy has tapped into a real passion for the dance which he fights but cannot deny, despite having to initially attend class behind his family's back. Eventually, with the encouragement of his teacher, who sees his passion after he takes his first class, Billy actually finds himself auditioning for a prestigious ballet academy, but this is not what this film is about. This film is not about the work and dedication it takes to dance or the roadblocks that can stand in your way nor is about it about the threatening of traditional gender stereotypes or about dancing being an indicator of sexual orientation, all of which are touched upon here, but this is not what this film is about. This film is about the pure joy of dancing and the passion that it can ignite inside a person. Director Stephen Daldry has mounted an imaginative and infectious story on a truly original canvas. Lee Hall's screenplay loses the film points, primarily for its needless subplot involving a coal miner's strike which distracts from the enjoyment of the primary story being told. Young Jamie Bell is nothing short of breathtaking in the title role, a riveting performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination. The casting of Bell is inspired because he is not a dancer, further sustaining the film's underlying theme of someone who is not necessarily supposed to be a dancer, but has a passion for it that forces him to work at it. I love when Billy is walking out of his audition and one of the auditors asks him what it feels like when he's dancing and he replies, It's like...electricity."" Julie Walters (EDUCATING RITA) received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her performance as Billy's teacher, who recognizes the lack of technique in Billy but sees his passion more than makes up for it. Strong support is also provided from Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven as Billy's dad and brother, respectively (though their thick Irish brogues make them hard to understand at times). A warm and energetic film that will make your heart full. Later turned into a stage musical.",Billy Elliot
68,the red duchess,Predictable but often magical (spoilers),7,11 October 2000,"Like almost every film about young people these days, Billy Elliot has a dead mum.  What's going on, were childbirth methods medieval 20 years ago? Anyway, 'Billy' is getting the kind of acclaim here 'American Beauty' was getting over there last year; you know, more-than-a-film-take-it-to-your-heart kind of thing.  Which made me wary.  In its mixture of feel-good fantasy and gritty urban realism, it is very similar to 'Brassed off' as people have been saying, except where once the combination was bewilderingly complex, a mixture of anger, tears and exhiliration, the trick seems a little more formulaic this time, a little more pat.  So when Billy gets into the ballet school, you expect the joy to be doused with the bitter petrol of socio-economic reality; when it is, the effect is not as moving as it should be.  Near the end there is a brilliant image of Dad and Tony being caged in an elevator shaft on returning to work after the unions are mauled by Thatcher's falange.  This mirrors an earlier scene when Billy, frustrated by circumstances which contrive to deprive him of fulfilling his potential, dances an extraordinary Gene Kelly-like explosion of emotion, full of a thrilling violence, and finds himself continually hemmed in by walls.  But Billy gets to go to London, gets to escape his family, history, economics, gender assumptions, his destiny, while his family remains firmly stuck in theirs.  Likewise, the filmmakers are trapped in the prison of genre.Once the narrative has been set up, there is barely a scene you cannot predict, such as Dad's initial hostility culminating in a spasm of generational violence, before eventually succumbing to the cause.  The Royal Ballet is, of course, dreadfully upper claws, full of complacently nice toffs whose 'never mind, there's always next year' reassurances sear on a working class boy who is bloody lucky to get even one chance.  Yes, he seems to fluff his audition, but in the film's phoniest moment, manages to articulate the feeling he gets when dancing, even though the whole point of the dancing was that it articulated what he could not say, wasn't allowed to say.  When he gets the crucial letter from the Royal Ballet, there is the predictable 'suspenseful' dragging out of the result.  His dead mother is replaced by a surrogate mother, but she makes the obligatory hallucinatory appearance.  An excellent shot linking the cemetary to the fading industrial town is repeated to unsubtle effect.Like Billy himself, the film's magic arises when its constraints force it to burst out - the credits sequence, to T-Rex's 'Cosmic Dancer', the banal wallpaper transformed, a suitably transcendent opening; the bending of time and space as Billy learns to twirl, his first step to promise, appropriately wreaking havoc on his own time and place; the feather foreplay with his teacher's daughter; the use of mirrors, not only to represent the continual splitting of Billy's personality (between genders; duty and desire; history and future; family and self), but as a magic gate into a fantasy, transformative world - one scene, where Billy and Mrs. Wilkinson are dancing in a boxing ring reflected in a mid-shot mirror, is brilliantly surreal; the sight of his friend in his sister's clothes; the harrowing scenes of the strike, proving once and for all the fascist basis of 80s Britain. 
The final scene is misjudged (when Jamie Bell as Billy is replaced by another actor), although Dad's bewilderment in the metro is wonderful; and there is nothing quite as rapturous as the scene in the meadow or on the bus in 'Ratcatcher', but, in the absence of anything else, 'Billy' is fine.",Billy Elliot
69,FlickJunkie-2,Almost flawless,9,22 August 2001,"I was prepared to love this film when I read the descriptions, and with one minor exception, my wish was fulfilled.  This is a compelling story of a young boy's courage to pursue his dream, despite its being completely antithetical to the cultural expectations of the town in which he lived.  In a mining town, where men are men, Billy (Jamie Bell) slips away each night after boxing practice to learn ballet with the girls.  In spite of enormous social pressure and a disapproving father, Billy persists in his dream to become a ballet dancer and emerges triumphant.This is a story that is less about dance than it is about social interaction.  The incredible pressure to be what one is expected to be is pitted elegantly against the unyielding desire to pursue one's ambitions. Also woven into the story are various themes about people who are different and how they handle being on the fringe.  The film does an excellent job of developing various characters and making us love them, foibles and all.My only reservation is that the film overemphasized certain of the human stories (particularly the minors' strike) at the expense of the dance.  We see glimpses of Billy's progress as a dancer, but he seems to explode from spastic and gawky to an accomplished tap artist with little transition. Also, there seems to be a disconnect between his exceptional tap skills and his tentative ballet skills, which is so discrepant that it is hard to believe it is the same dancer.  While the dance theme is clearly subordinate to the human issues, I felt it should have been more believable and better developed to complete the film.Not much more could have been asked of Jamie Bell in this role.  In his film debut he is mesmerizing, both in his acting and dance performances.  Bell always found exactly the right emotion to portray Billy's conflicts, disappointments and stubborn persistence.  Bell is the keystone that holds the entire film together and he is the reason it succeeds so completely.The ensemble supporting Bell is also first rate as is the direction of Stephen Daldry.  Daldry gives the story that quaint small town British feel, full of brutal honesty and simple human truths.  Daldry's greatest success is in the pure sincerity of the actors' performances making every frame realistic and convincing, and earning him an Oscar nomination for best director in only his second film.  Julie Walters, also nominated for best supporting actress, does a fine job as the tough and determined ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis gives a standout performance as Billy's dad.This is an inspirational film that is just a hair short of perfect.  I rated it a 9/10.  With a little better development of the dance theme it might have been flawless.  Nonetheless, it is one of the most compelling and uplifting films of the year with a positive and upbeat message that is sure to capture your heart.",Billy Elliot
70,roedyg,live with a homophobic father,7,4 November 2016,"Billy Elliot is about a fairly ordinary boy, his authoritarian homophobic father, a loutish brother, and a down at the heels dance instructor. I expected Billy to be effeminate, maybe even camp. However, he is a played by an ordinary sassy 11-year old who likes to move, to dance, and to do ballet.It is heartbreaking watching the poor kid trying deal with his adamant father.The father comes around almost instantly on seeing Billy dance. This left me reeling.The movie leaves out all of Billy's formal education and early professional career.By the end Dad is proud of his son, even if he dances, dances ballet, is gay and belongs to a travesty ballet company. This just seems a little too ""happy ever after"" at the cost of realism.",Billy Elliot
71,movieguy1021,Billy Elliot: 7/10,7,22 December 2002,"Have you ever been criticized for something you enjoyed doing? Then you'll see how close to a real life Billy Elliot can be.Jamie Bell plays the title character, son of Jackie (Gary Lewis), brother of Tony (Jamie Draven), grandson of Grandma (Jean Heywood). Jackie and Tony are coal-miners who are on strike, but continue to give Billy fifty pence a week for boxing lessons. When he accidentally goes into a ballet lesson instead, he enjoys it, much to his father's dismay. Billy has to undergo ridiculing from both his friends and family.Touchingly beautiful, and yet selfishly self-conscious. Its wonderful story seems to be so real and so vivid, with sincere emotions. However, it knows that its touching and tries to cash in on them. It tried to be too many things (and wanted us to believe that all of them it were): drama, comedy, thriller, romance. It only completed on one of them: drama. Its drama was real and lifelike, but it seemed to try too hard for laughs (which they didn't succeed for me), and put in a ""fight scene"", so to speak, for thrills. A character that comes in for a couple scenes has a psuedo-romance with Billy. It would have been a lot better if they had thrown her in more, so then they could play on the romance quality of it, which isn't much.Its story did have substance, don't get me wrong. Very multilayered. Billy's dancing, the strike, his cross-dressing friend. All of the subplots were developed just enough for you to enjoy them.Bell gives a shockingly great breakthrough performance. Look for him to be in more starring roles. The rest of the cast were basically unknown to us Yanks, but they were all very good, as well. I especially thought Lewis was great.The story of Billy Elliot seems far-fetched, but it is true to life. It could happen to any one of us. I think that's what makes it so good. If it was so unbelievable, it wouldn't be as captivating.Billy Elliot is a touching and grand film, but with flaws.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.",Billy Elliot

73,khatcher-2,Predictable sociological story well carried out,7,23 April 2003,"Set against the background of the strikes and consequent upheavals between the miners and the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, `Billy Elliot' is an interesting if predictable film. Part of its interest lies in not having the standard UK accents from down south, but the good almost `Geordie' accents from the far north of England: though we do not get to see much of the beautiful countryside of Durham, Northumberland, just a few residential streets of miners' houses. Jamie Bell himself is from Manchester, but the northern accent is near enough similar as to go well with the more authentic `Geordie' use of English. His interpretation is sincere, and at times is pretty convincing. Hats off to the brilliant `old dame' Jean Heywood as Billy's grandmother. Gary Lewis as his father and Jamie Draven as his elder brother both put in admirable interpretations, and Julie Walters offers a very level-headed reading of her part, though her accent seems to be from a fair bit further south  just a touch of `brummy', perhaps.In such an atmosphere, with masculine domination of just about everything, more so here as Jamie's mother is dead, the fact that the little boy does not wish to do such manly things as knocking anyone's  head off or simply belting a punch-bag but is attracted to ballet, works out to be just a little too steep for Billy's father and elder brother, both embittered hard-core strikers clashing head-on with that woman from Number Ten. However, the little boy's desires hold out and the rest is an almost triumphal fairy-tale exposition  if it were not for the shrewd directing keeping everything in line with the rife and social upheaval going on at the time.The famous miners' strike of 1984 had the UK importing coal from Poland and the USA (`cheaper' says the smug lady from Parliament) and caused enormous social crises from the mining valleys of South Wales to the Midlands and Lancashire, and of course the far north of Durham and Northumberland. This should be remembered while watching this film: it has its painful moments.Now, let me see: ah, Stephen Daldry's `The Hours' is still on at the local `multitheatre' so I think I'll just pop along there in a couple of hours as I am on holiday and not working late ..........",Billy Elliot
74,braddugg,A good film that is dramatized a lot.,6,8 September 2014,"A good film that is dramatized a lot.Look at the scene in which Billy gets a call from school, and he leans back in the chair relieved with a sigh and there is a dramatic score that plays in the background, we all know that he is going to make it, at least I knew he is going to make it but I do not think it need to be that dramatized. So barring the melodrama this is a good movie in parts and touches a few right chords, like Billy's emphatic exhibition of Ballet to get a school admission or his dad saying ""he is just 11 years old, lets give him a chance"" these made me feel nevertheless but yet those moments were just not enough yet. Jamie Bell at his age, gave a supreme performance and it's a real tough thing for a 12 year boy to learn and perform ballet. Perhaps thats one of the reasons more than anything that this movie got a wide recognition. The script is good and so is the cinematography yet, there is something that makes the movie fall, and it is the editing. Remove the dramatic pieces and cut it down by 15 minutes, this wold have been a great film. Yet, the way it is, it is just good. Also, the music could have been toned down a bit to make the whole thing realThis film can be termed as a good self help movie as it helps us understand that if we have passion in something, mostly things fall in place and help us to pursue the passion. At least, that's what happened with Billy Elliot. Also a mention of Julie Walters as Mrs. Wilkinson, she was good each time and great few times.Overall, a good film yet not a recommended one. A 3/5 only for this.",Billy Elliot
75,Spanner-2,Dull,3,30 January 2001,"While technically sound, I found this tale rather uninteresting.  The poor kid wants to be a ballerina.. good for him.. unfortunately I really didn't care much. The film itself is well made, but the storyline simply didn't interest me. GRADE: B-",Billy Elliot
76,CinematicInceptions,Pretty good,8,11 June 2017,"This is one of the only feature films I've seen that is about kids but not geared for kids (the only other that comes to mind is Stand By Me). This sort of combination is found a lot in independent shorts, and it just goes to show how kids are forced into an unkind world well before most of their parents would wish them to. It's unfortunate, because this portrays a child's journey of following his dreams pretty realistically in my opinion, whereas a movie with a lower MPAA rating would give a more romantic take on it and be ""kid friendly"" but also potentially misleading.What the movie does a very nice job of that I am only realizing now is how it shows the way that ballet affects Billy's life. Ballet changes *what* Billy is, not *who* he is-- his life views and his circumstances, yes, but not who he is as at his core. Ballet, his previously undiscovered passion, gives him something to confirm his identity with, but does not bring about any great changes within him on a emotional or moral level. Instead, it brings about change in those around him and gives them a new perspective and hope, namely his dad. The relationship between Billy and his dad was a little shakier. There's a common belief among screenwriters that third act problems originate in the first act, and I think that holds true here. Billy and his dad's relationship seems like it begins right when the movie does, which may be true given the recent death of Billy's mother. The only things that were used to establish their dynamic were social norms, which is not intrinsically bad, but immediate family members don't relate to each other based solely on social norms no matter how non-existent their relationship is. I don't want to totally bash the father-son portrayal here, because it actually avoids most of the common and annoying tropes that come with such movies. But there was definitely a foundation missing.It was surprisingly entertaining to see Billy discovering his love of dancing. Jamie Bell owns his performance in this respect, conveying an unashamed love of dance without coming off as a ""poof"". As a young man who has had many passion hobbies (one of which is analyzing movies), I could see a lot of parallels between my own experiences and those of Billy becoming a dancer. It begins with some uncertainty as to whether he likes it and whether he's any good at it, then a fear of whether he wants to identify with his new passion, then embracing ballet internally while hiding it from those close to him. Granted, my own hobbies have not been met with such resistance as Billy's but there's always a bit of a fear that they will.I would recommend anyone over 13 seeing this. Yes, there's a lot of language, but trust me, it's nothing a 13 year old hasn't heard. The same goes for the homosexual motifs. There are things about it that I think could have been better, but it was pretty good overall with some great emotional themes and an innocent undertone amidst hopeless circumstances. Overall Rating: 8/10.",Billy Elliot

Sure, you may look like an idiot, but who cares after a movie experience like this one? Billy Elliot is without a doubt the best film I have seen this year at the cinema (even better than Fight Club, and we all know [I hope] that FC is a brilliant film). It's a typical British film, and I mean that in the best way possible. Brilliant actors, a great story, great production design (feels like you're there), great direction, sadness and jokes and that special mood and tone of a British comedy/drama. And Jamie Bell is magnificent as Billy. I just have one thing to say to director Stephen Daldry and all the actors and everyone else who worked on Billy Elliot: thanks for making this film!

80,Angeneer,Chick Flick a l' Anglaise?,7,21 July 2001,"Stephen Daldry apparently figured out it would be a good idea to borrow all the powerful aspects of British cinema we've witnessed over the years (namely social criticism, straightforward dialogues, realistic family confrontations, the Thatcher decadence atmosphere and scenery) and mix them with a corny and shallow theme, in order to create a ""socially aware"" feel-good movie.

81,paulcreeden,What a film!,10,13 October 2000,"This film is about Liberation in the most fundamental sense. The story of one proletarian boy's struggle to just begin to develop amazing natural gifts is brilliantly told. The viewer is shown the objective and subjective (verging on production numbers) realities of a conflicted and dominated child with seamless grace. Amazingly, the film deals with BIG issues very effectively by using the various vignettes in Billy's life. We are allowed to see things through the less cluttered child's eyes. Jamie Bell is himself a talented boy and simply IS the title role. Julie Walters, whom I will always see as the uneducated Rita, was a natural for her role. Gary Lewis, as the collier dad,  was able to keep his potentially dastardly character from being a bad guy. Jamie Draven, as Billy's much older brother, captured the conflicts in his relationships extremely well. For me, Jean Heywood's farewell to Billy was a crystal revelation of what this Elliot family was all about. I cried, as I always do when a film captures the emotional fullness of a subject. The film is about class. The film is about talent. The film is about the unscarred beauty of youth. The film is about the victory of honesty and love. So, go see it and bring a handkerchief.",Billy Elliot
82,Hunky Stud,3 great stories in one movie.,9,15 August 2003,"I really enjoyed this movie. I heard something great about it, but i didn't expect that it can be so good. I really like the tender moments between the two boys. And at the end, when billy kissed the other boy on his cheek, that is a very sweet moment. this movie basically has 3 stories. the main story is about Billy, the second is the strike at the mine. And the mini story is about Billy's friend who loves him. I was a little confused at the very beginning about the strike story. It did not explain well what was happening. However, I suppose that it maybe because I don't live in Britain, so I don't know their local events. I remembered seeing the movie ""full monty"" in which was also about stories laid off workers who worked at mines. Unlike some of the movies in which you can always get the outcome, this film has quite a few unexpected twists in it. For example, when the teacher suggested Billy to go for an audition, one probably would expect that he would go to that audition and won admission instantly. then everyone will be happily ever after. it didn't happen that way. There is one little minor detail that i didn't like. At the end of the movie, it showed the Billy's dad and brother visiting the grown up him dancing. However, I felt that the grown up billy is a little bit too old. they should have picked a teenager. And his dad looked older, however, his brother looked the same. That is not very convincing.",Billy Elliot
83,smakawhat,Get off your Duffs stupid gits and see this FILM!,9,15 November 2000,"Billy Elliot, is several great things.  It is about becoming something important when the odds are against you.  It has fantastic acting, where a hard fought striking coal miners family has to face odds with an impatient young man or face the wisdom of his father.In this you add, the look and feel of a North England town, and the saga of a kid who wants to be a ballet dancer.  What genius of writing only made brilliant by the fantastic cast in this film.  THIS is what makes that Banal C**P coming out of Hollywood so mundane.  Gary Lewis is fantastic as the coal miners father, the chain smoking ballet teacher is fantastic... and then there is Billy...WHERE did they FIND THIS KID!!

85,barberoux,Formulaic.,6,8 May 2001,Billy Elliot wasn't a bad movie.  It just followed a formula too closely for my liking.  The formula is: A child from a poor ignorant family gets involved in an activity not usually associated with his socioeconomic class. The family doesn't understand or approve so the activity is done on the sly.  A wise teacher recognizes the child's talent and encourages the activity.  The child has a chance to display his talent to someone of influence but a family crisis threatens to wreck the talented child's chances.  The ignorant parent becomes enlightened at the last moment and they hurriedly show up before the influential person who sees the child's talent and saves the day.  This movie has been made many times before. There were no surprises in this retelling.  I felt some of the scenes were very contrived and didn't make sense given the scenes that preceded them. There was a lack of emotional and character continuity.  Billy liked ballet but he wasn't gay.  That point was blatantly made.  Why?  Why couldn't he be gay?  That would have given the movie a twist.  Maybe the demographics of the prospective paying audience would not like the main character to be gay so he likes ballet but isn't gay.  A gay character was included to show how tolerant and understanding Billy could be but in another scene he is shown to be crude and brutal.  Also the demographics would dictate a rock music background so at a climatic moment the Swan Lake music is introduced but quickly replaced with some mediocre rock song.  It made no sense.  The cursing was also too much.   The movie was rated R because of it.  I would think the target audience would be families and younger people that the R rating would exclude.  If mature audiences were the target group why have such a bland sweet story.  A loss of a big audience just so you can say the eff word.  It makes no sense.,Billy Elliot
86,dy158,A dream admist the struggle,8,25 June 2012,"It was the 1984-85 miners' strike in Britain. The miners were on strike throughout the country, including 11-year-old Billy Eilliot's (Jamie Bell) father Jackie (Gary Lewis) and older brother Tony (Jamie Draven). Billy also lives with his grandmother (Jean Heywood).In the midst of the miners' strike, Jackie took his son Billy to boxing lessons. It was not what Billy wanted, and he one day chanced upon a ballet lesson going on nearby in the Sports Centre where he has his boxing lessons. Billy soon became interested in what he saw and initially took lessons secretly from whom will be his teacher in Sandra Wilkinson (Julie Walters) along with the other female ballet students in the class. It was something which Billy's grandmother would know about initially, as she talked about how she could have become a professional dancer herself in her younger days. Billy's father Jackie would come to know about the secret ballet lessons and he forbade his son from doing so. That did not stop Billy from taking lessons from Mrs. Wilkinson, which also intertwined with the miners' strike getting more violent and bloody.It would be when Billy was supposed to attend an audition at the Royal Ballet School in London which Mrs. Wilkinson felt that Billy has the talent which put Billy's talent on a collision course with his father and especially his older brother. There was a skirmish between the police and the miners which Billy's older brother Tony got involved and saw Billy missed his audition in London. There would be a major confrontation at the Eilliot's residence when Mrs. Wilkinson visited the family where it would become over whether Billy should be allowed to become a professional ballet dancer.It is quite a heart-warming and up-lifting film, of a young boy and his dream of wanting to be a ballet dancer and the obstacles he had to face along the way, considering of what was plaguing his family in the form of the miners' strike. The backdrop of the film which forms the basis also gives an insight of the struggle between the miners and the government of the day, for the non-British audience.

87,mhasheider,A real dandy that's without doubt one of the year's best.,9,18 April 2001,"Inspired by the actual events surrounding a strike by British coal-miners in the mid-eighties, ""Billy Elliot"" is the tale of Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), an eleven year-old boy who is slowly, but quickly attracted to ballet dancing and is taught by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters), the chain-smoking dance instructor to become one himself despite that his grumpy Dad (Gary Lewis) and Billy's older brother, Tony (Jamie Draven) who once oppose Billy's dream before seeing the potential that Billy has.  It's well-acted by all (notably Bell, Lewis, and especially Walters, who garned a Best Supporting Actress nomination), masterfully written by Lee Hall and directed by Stephen Daldry, who both earned Oscar nominations.  Unfortunately, the film is another innocent casualty of the MPAA, who has given it an ""R"" rating (and not ""PG-13"") although the F-word is mentioned several times, but it's used in a respectful manner and not carelessly.

88,nicolechan916,A moving story with pretty good acting and great chemistry.,8,30 September 2014,"The character development and Bell's acting were really superb. The film was well made and edited as it perfectly captured the struggles that Billy face and takes the audience along on the ride that is his life. Bell too, accurately showed his character's frustrations and inability to stop dancing as the passion burned in him.The acting from the other actors and actresses were pretty good, though I would have to say not on par with Bell's. They got into their characters well enough, however it felt awkward at times, especially when Lewis as Elliot's father was trying to act really angry, it felt staged to me.The chemistry between the actors felt really real. Elliot's friendship with Michael was so sweet that I almost died inside. Elliot's relationship with the rest of the characters too, was well displayed.The dancing element to this was really cool; Bell can really dance. I liked that the dancing was incorporated into all kinds of scenes as it enhanced the different moods being displayed. The ending though did not have a lot of dancing, was a great way to end.I also loved the fact that the film is based on how boys should not do 'girly' stuff like ballet, and instead should do 'manly' stuff like football and whatnot. Take those gender stereotypes and gender intensification, and stuff it somewhere else.One down side to this story though, was that I did not really get what was happening in the community except that there was a strike. I was a bit unsure as to what the father and brother were doing, and why they didn't really get along with Billy. That was a bit shaky to me.Read more of my reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",Billy Elliot
89,patriciogl10,Brilliantly honest.,8,26 November 2019,"What can I say? This film is a beautiful, passionate project built with heart and honesty. It is not solely focused on the human aspect but there are also political undertones that help shape the troubling context Billy Elliot is set in. Billy is played brilliantly by Jamie Bell, who like any of us, merely starts observing something out of curiosity and slowly feels that electrifying spark that ignites our interests and turns them to passion for something. His passion for dancing, is somehow frawned upon by conventional society, and specially those close to Billy, like his father and brother.Being a young boy, is hard to go against his father in pursuit of what he really loves doing, so to help him smooth things out is his dancing teacher, so convincingly played by Julie Walters. The film is stunningly shot, so straightforward and transparent, almost exuding sincerity.Not only does it shine in terms of what it evokes but also how Billy's own struggle is shown. He's a troubled boy because he is not allowed to pursue his dreams, he wants to dance because that's what makes him feel alive and talented, as he becomes great at it.A truly inspirational film, with a story destined to move you through its journey and resolution.",Billy Elliot
90,fimimix,..dance-on billy..,10,16 May 2006,"I'm so happy to see so many people love this movie - to me, it is a textbook for overly-spoiled American kids. It is just wonderful to be able to relate to the problems in this family, and then seeing them getting resolved. Billy is a revelation - I love grandma !! All that background story about the mines and the comedy that's in it - then the sudden break-down of Dad - is so real-life. I wasn't the least bit surprised to see the little, sissy boy in there - and thought Billy was a champ the way he handled it. The ballet-teacher was a female drag-queen, and wonderful.....I wonder if she picked-up her daughter was hot for Billy? The whole story was so full of every-day happenings, but the grandest theme and point made was the total turn-around by Dad. I had the greatest empathy with him when they went to the ballet-school. He knew he was way out-of-place, but stuck to his plan to do the best he could by a son he didn't truly understand.As others have written, the ending was so appropriate - the sissy all grown-up with her lover and in drag, and those two macho miners not the least bit bothered. To have Billy be the star in Bourne's ""Swan Lake"" was a shocker - but should have been expected. How many Americans do you think have seen that ballet ?

Like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2's latex masks, the conventions of a genre must be accepted from the very start.  A ""feel good"" picture like BILLY demands that viewers accept a range of emotional string-tuggers: Billy's granny is going senile; Billy's mum is dead; Billy's Dad and Bro are striking miners; the family's never been to the big city, etc. etc.  Yet at every turn the honest and winning performances defy the conventions and will win over all but the most miserable of spirit.

92,TuckMN,Billy's excellent adventure.,10,21 November 2000,"From the opening sequence where the soundtrack proclaims `I was dancing when I was twelve' to the last moment of this incredible film you will probably fall in love with Billy Elliott the character and Jamie Bell  the talented young actor that portrays him.This film is what all film should be and all too often is not:  story driven.There are no big flashy special effects, no car chases, no guns, and no overt sexuality.  There is some violence  but it is not gratuitous and is necessary to the plot and to the development of the characters into real people.Set in the coal mining district in the north of England, Billy's passion for dance is as unlikely as the existence of a snowball in hell: his family solves problems with their fists.Julie Walters, whom I did not recognize even though I have seen `Educating Rita' at least a dozen times, is fantastic as Billy's chain-smoking dance teacher that sees something in Billy that he does not see in himself.  As in most of her performances, she very nearly steals the show.But the show belongs to Jamie Bell.  Though he is actually 4 years older than the character he plays, he is the quintessential man/boy, forced to be an adult because times and situations are difficult.  Though this is his first film he carries the whole movie and appears in nearly every scene  and he carries it magnificently.There is much to this film  It is a simple story of a boy that wants to be a ballet dancer  but there are so many subtexts and complexities that it becomes so much more than the simple story it, at first, appears to be.Again, British cinema tackles a subject that is completely taboo to American film:  the subject of a young person's sexuality (see `Beautiful Thing'). It acknowledges that young people do have sexual feelings and they are often confusing and complex and not to be swept under the carpet or ignored.This is only screenwriter Lee Halls' second film  if he continues in this vein expect greatness.So too for Jamie Bell -- he has the makings of a true star, with a quality that leaps off the screen and into your heart.This is one of the finest films ever made and upholds the magnificent tradition that is British cinema.",Billy Elliot
93,patrickfilbeck,A poetic iconoclasm in a calm manner,10,12 November 2021,"In beautiful pictures, Billy Elliot tells a perfectly coordinated mixture of collective thinking, social drama, and the path of the individual and art. In a fantastically depicted and staged world of the working class, in a concrete family that is embedded in the striking neighborhood and community of like-minded people shaken by labor struggles, the story of Billy Elliot is told, who still allows himself his own in all these rightly taking place struggles Develop dreams. The resistance he has to face is by no means portrayed in a clichéd manner, his individualistic element is not a contradiction to solidarity with the community. In addition, there are pictures that are poetically staged, side stories that have neither slipped into them nor seem undeveloped, but which also have a lot to contribute to the main story and the ideal of the film. The acting is great across the board, and the understanding of the subject is impressive, which is reflected above all in the coordinated harmony of the images of the boy dancing the ballet and the coal workers defending themselves.

Dialogue's intelligent and worth listening to carefully. Choreography, while not the best, is still believable and enticing. Acting was almost perfect by all the actors involved. It's unbelievably hard to not to feel for Billy or the coal miners. Another top-notch British production.",Billy Elliot
95,budmassey,British cinema once again has a lesson for Hollywood.,10,10 August 2001,"I always enjoy reading the comments other folks leave for movies like this one.  Usually, I'm left pondering whether the odd dismissive comments that demonstrate their author's ignorance are amusing or tragic.  ""This is a movie about a boy who wants to dance, and his father doesn't want him to."" Really?  And Casablanca is about a night club, The Maltese Falcon was about a bird, and Rosebud was a sled.  Have we really numbed our minds to such a sorry state?Billy Elliott is about how even the most improbable dreams can flourish, and even in a world where not even survival can be taken for granted.  It affirms the power of the human spirit and explores the generational chasms that can exist within families, and forces us to confront stereotypes of working class values, frustrated aspirations, and even homophobia.  Through it all, Billy Elliott is an uplifting story of the triumph of a young boy's will over staggering obstacles.  It is an exquisite delicacy in a heap of fodder, and if you've spoiled your appetite by gorging on garbage then shame on you.Julie Walters was my pick for Best Supporting Actress, but Americans don't like actors, they like stars.  Jamie Bell's performance was far better than that of Haley Joel Osment, nothing against Haley, who was magnificent, but since the good parts weren't all underlined for us, most Americans will miss the rich lodes of gold in a film like Billy, preferring to pan for nuggets in a torrent of trash. The soundtrack was brilliant, and there are some dance scenes that are overflowing with complex and beautiful symbolism.  There's also fun, pathos, despair and hope.  And above all, there is the glorious ascent of the human spirit.  British cinema once again has a lesson for Hollywood.",Billy Elliot
96,Geofbob,Sheer magic,9,22 December 2005,"Billy Elliott is a moving, uplifting, and often exuberant, drama about motherless young Billy (Jamie Bell) fulfilling his dream of becoming a ballet dancer, in the process overcoming the objections and prejudices of his father and brother (Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven).It is also a piece of magic realism, with political overtones. By setting their near fairy tale in the context of a close-knit mining community, and more specifically against the backdrop of the 1984/5 miners' strike - a defining moment of modern British economic and social history - writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry are able to refer to gender and class issues, without turning their work into a political tract, and without losing focus on the central human drama.The film is realised near flawlessly. Bell achieves a convincing blend of adolescent bewilderment and defiance; if his dancing is not quite as good as we might expect, the storyline explains this away by saying that at this early stage his attitude and drive are more important than his technique. The dancing set pieces, clearly inspired more by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly than by Nijinksky, are performed with gusto, mainly to pop songs by T-Rex.Lewis and Draven put gritty realism and passion into their roles of a father and son committed to their community and to the miners' cause. They make us feel their despair as they realise that this cause is lost; but also their endurance as they come to terms both with Billie's aspirations and their own uncertain futures - within a few years most UK coalmines would be closed. (The colliery in Easington, the real-life location of the film, closed in 1994.). The scenes of violence between strikers and police are presented uncompromisingly and authentically, but with the occasional touch of humour.Julie Walters provides an outstanding performance as Mrs Wilkinson, the dancing teacher who recognises and fosters Billie's talent; and helps him resist his own and his family's inhibitions. She is perfect as the chain-smoking, straight-talking mentor, who has her own personal disappointments and hurts, which she hopes Billie's success will help heal. To we outsiders watching the movie, Mrs Wilkinson appears as an integral part of the local community; but it is made clear that in the mid-80s, as far as Billie's family and friends are concerned, she is a middle class outsider, almost as alien as another species.One issue which the film tackles head-on is traditional heterosexual male abhorrence of homosexuality. This attitude clearly underlies the shock of Billie's father and brother when they discover his interest in ballet. They would be even more horrified if they realised that his best friend was discovering gay tendencies in himself. It is typical of the sensitive direction that without labouring the point the film indicates by its close that attitudes towards gays changed radically during the 1980s and 90s along with the industrial landscape.",Billy Elliot
97,diand_,Practice session,7,15 August 2005,"Billy Elliot tells the simple story of a boy from the working classes having a particular talent for ballet. Because his mining family has troubles from both the death of the mother and a mining strike the talent is not recognized nor supported by his family. He does get support from a middle class woman (Julie Walters) who somewhat projects her own problems on Billy by giving him private lessons and develops his talent. (The class difference being shown by the dog that barks every time Billy or his father enters that community).Others tales are spun in: Billy, Debbie and Michael reach puberty and the confusing time a teenager goes through on that age is well portrayed, for example by Debbie seducing Billy in an interesting scene where the camera rolls on so long it makes the scene almost uncomfortable, the gay Michael seducing Billy in a way, and Billy staying focused throughout, but having fear of failure. And we have the miner's strike at the time of Thatcher in office as a background story. Children as usual seem so unaffected by their environment, as Billy and Debbie walk along a couple of police men with Debbie's stick against them they talk on and aren't even aware of what's going on.Besides the good soundtrack it is sometimes the editing of it all that gives this movie something extra: The weaving of Billy practicing at home from a book and executing that in the gym, mining strike images cut with Billy dancing. Stephen Daldry constructed some of the scenes in The Hours in the same way.Three scenes in particular stand out for me: When Billy's father comes to terms with the talent of his son. When Billy leaves his home for London for his education: He says his grandmother goodbye, one final look at the house and the neighborhood (with the ever-present little girl) is such a good film moment. And the tale of The Swan Lake told when they take the ferry (!), here combined with the music.But still this seems all exercise for the making of a more important piece of art: Stephen Daldry's almost perfect movie The Hours.",Billy Elliot

It makes you feel so good, so hopeful, and so full of goodwill... It is better than a hundred anti-depression pills.You could say that the story is predictable, but it is so much more than that.  It is NOT predictable how you will FEEL as you see Billy go through the hardships which he and his family encounter.  The performances are stunning - especially the young man who plays Billy - but also the wonderful Julie Walters, whom you may recall from her electric performance in ""Educating Rita.""There is no one on earth who could watch this film and not leave feeling like he/she is walking on clouds.

101,hippiedj,Contains a gay stereotype that's so tired it's at home and in bed...,5,1 June 2004,"Sure, Billy Elliot can be considered an endearing drama, and you do want to root for Billy to succeed. The story of a boy going against the male-ego dominated society in Northern England and fulfilling his dream of becoming a dancer is charming indeed. BUT...a subplot involving Billy's gay friend is ridiculous. While so many on here have gone sugary over Billy Elliot's charms, I'm concentrating here on a major problem:The writers in movie-world have this idea that all gay male characters (in this case, Billy's friend) HAVE to be cross-dressers and have a desire to be like women. That whole subplot was unnecessary and just takes a huge step backward for intelligence. They must be listening to too much Howard Stern. Yes, we know Billy is heterosexual, and in order to have him pursue his ""non-masculine"" dream of dancing and come off looking respectable, the actual gay character is portrayed as a stereotype, dressing up in his mother's clothes (shades of that character of Billy Crystal's in ""Soap""). By the end of the film he shows up at Billy's big dance debut looking straight out of Queer Eye with an equally prissy black man, who has an expression on his face like he just dined on a very sour lemon. Face the facts, movie writers: the majority of cross-dressers are heterosexual, not gay. If you're going to establish that the young boy is going to be gay as an adult, show us other things instead of the usual tired stereotypes. If the character were a lesbian instead, you can bet she'd be ""hot,"" talk like any other woman, and not have any butch mannerisms. I don't know who the writers keep learning what they know about gay culture from, but all the gay men I know are quite blue collar and definitely not FABulous. I'm really sick of filmmakers and TV folks who only know how to show things ONE way, instead of showing the truth or at least showing a variety.If the ridiculous gay subplot were not in the film, I'd have highly recommended Billy Elliot to friends. Sorry though, I just get annoyed with his friend's portrayal as a cliché stereotype, so many points are taken off for that one. Think of it this way, any youngster that might have thoughts he/she might be gay and see this portrayal in the film, it would really screw up his idea of what being gay is.....OK, now you folks can read all the other reviews of praise on IMDb, just understand how little things in a film like what I mentioned can hold back any true progress for some people overall.",Billy Elliot
102,wuzupn_tb,A dramatic beauty,8,27 October 2002,"The childhood of a ballet dancer is shown here with ups and downs and lots of twists.  The movie seems to real to be true. The characters in the movie are flawed yet good people, which means the acting is very well done.  Your mood changes with the movie's mood, which means the script and direction are very well done.  I think you should defenitly see this movie if you want to feel every emotion there is. B+, 8/10",Billy Elliot
103,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Everything a movie should be,9,29 October 2020,"Bright, lively, infectious... Billy Elliot is hard not to love and fulfils all the attributes of a superbly done movie. The film stayed true to its gritty, northern English roots and examined the lower class culture of the 80s, whilst retaining its notably fun and humorous atmosphere throughout. Billy Elliot dives into many different themes such as family, poverty, the 80s miner strikes, sexuality and masculinity, which all balanced well in relation to Billy's budding love for dancing and how these issues impacted on his new found hobby. The performances were excellent, especially from Jamie Bell, Gary Lewis and Julie Walters, who all had amazing chemistry on screen. The soundtrack was electric and helped to create some very memorable and compelling scenes. The movie is packed with vigour, drive and an inspirational undertone, reminding the audience to follow their dreams no matter the obstacles, making this film very motivational and pleasing for all. Overall, a charming and uplifting movie about a young boys love of dancing and the obstacles he has to overcome to fulfil his dream, jam packed with notorious English humour and music. Highly recommend.",Billy Elliot
104,Ron Plasma,Billy Whiz,6,28 February 2001,"Nineteen eighty four/eighty five was an emotional time for me.  Thankfully I wasn't losing my job down a mine, or my very life on a football terrace. But sons were coming thick and fast, and my idealistic vision for their future was fast being shattered by grim reality.  And so the dual dramas of parent/child and system/individual in Billy Elliot quickly found vulnerable flesh in me.  Only after a settling gulp did I start to see the wider picture.  This is OK stuff - but just a little shmultsy.  The artistic kid from the wrong side of the tracks?  Surely Monty Python in the seventies, or Beyond the Fringe in the sixties, parodied this into ridicule?  Nevertheless the Bell boy was a great (dancing) star and his disgruntled frowns were adequate acting.  I'm afraid I can't say the same about his support, especially Julie Walters, for whom this seemed an exercise in stock character acting, without any real relevance to the rest of the plot.

It shows the angst of growing up poor in a mining town in northern England, and the struggles a family has when they go on strike. During this we see how Billy finds himself through dance, going against convention and against his own family. Some scenes are hard to watch, especially with the father, but they are played so well. The last scene of the movie brings tears to my eyes every time I see it and it will do the same to you.",Billy Elliot
106,Embley,sweet film with grim edges..,7,16 November 2000,"jamie bell really does an amazing job in this film.  when he first danced i thought - my god why would anyone think he could dance?  but in fact he moves in a really unique way and he comes across as very original.  as it turns out i wish we had seen him dance more.  he has style.julie walters and gary lewis are also very good.  it is definitely a performance driven film.  it has the requisite tears and laughter (my only real beef with the film is that debbie drops out of sight half way through the film and i thought she was great so i wanted to see her more and find out what happened in her life as well...it is a nice film, well worth seeing, although i don't think it is entirely necessary to see it on the big screen (well everything is better on the big screen but you won't lose a huge amount visually in the transition from the screen to video..)",Billy Elliot
107,PeterJackson,What's so special about this one?,7,24 November 2000,"This is a decent drama, nothing more, nothing less. The acting is very very good, especially by the young lead, Jamie Bell. The dancing too is of a high quality and the film has got its heart on the right place. So what's wrong with it? First of all, the story seems all too familiar. People looking for a way out of poverty, mines being closed, a stubborn father, a crazy grandmother(is this the ""funny"" character in the film?),etc. Have they seen the underrated BRASSED OFF, or the slightly overrated THE FULL MONTY? I bet they watched it very carefully. Plus, the story is too dramatic, this is clearly made to make people cry. But...it doesn't work. An example of a film that DOES work(and produces tears): DANCER IN THE DARK. Finally, it's way too predictable: boy is a loser in boxing, but appears to be a talent in ballet...you can guess the rest. Did I already mention his father is against his choice? BILLY ELLIOT is a decent film, as long as you don't expect too much of it, as I did. Then it will be a big disappointment. But apparently it looks good, when you say you liked that ""latest British social drama"". 6/10",Billy Elliot
108,shaid,A feel good movie,8,12 March 2001,"I liked this movie. It made me laugh and eventually made me cry a little. It deals with everything from how we deal with the death of a close one to how we let him go. It also deals with achieving our ambitions against the backdrop of an hostile environment. In short it deals with everything we go through in our lives and do it good. Jamie Bell is excellent as the hero and so is everyone else, though I found Julie Walters a little bit irritating. The story itself shift well between Billy Elliot and the backdrop story of the miners strikes in England in 1984. The rhythm of the film is good and it is helped by the music of that period.One last thing. Is the film a gay one or not? The makers of the film left it deliberately vague. There are some hints that Billy is gay and there are some hints which contradict this assumption. It definitely in the eye of the beholder and any interpretation can be correct. The reason that many see Billy as gay is because he is an outsider and has to deal with an hostile surroundings,a feeling many gay peoples can identify with. Whether he is gay or not, is not important to the fact that this is a movie that make you feel good.Go see the movie,you will not regret.",Billy Elliot
109,the-gossip-king,Review for Billy Elliot & Billy Elliot the Musical,7,3 July 2008,"I saw the musical for Billy Elliot the other night and ad to review it. I had also seen the movie recently so I thought it would be a good opportunity to review both. ********* The Movie: Average... Jamie Bell is brilliant and seems to be keeping that up with King Kong and Flags of our Fathers. Julie Walters is as usual, brilliant! The story is dull however as is the writing. The music score was awful. Stephen Daldry did a fairly decent job with the movie. My main problem with the movie is how it tries to mix drama with comedy and in some places it does work but in some places it does not. Overall; 5/10 ********* The Musical: Brilliant! There were four boys who were Billy and the one who was performing on my night was terrific and had a very nice voice as well. The dancing was just as good as the movie if not better and the woman who plays Mrs. Wilkinson reminds me of Julie Walters which is of course a good thing. Simply stunning! Overall; 9/10 ********* You should see both!",Billy Elliot
110,Andreas_N,Pursue your dreams,9,13 December 2005,"Stephen Daldry has directed an inspiring movie that needs to be ranged in among the highest ever achievements of British cinema. The following lines will outline my approach to a movie that features one of the strongest and most compelling messages and some of the finest character portrayals ever to be seen on screen. Thus this movie follows the premises of classic British gems like ""Kes"" or ""Ratcatcher"", thereby paving the way for modern British drama as implemented in ""Dear Frankie"", which is similar in taste and tune and as appreciated as ""Billy Elliot"".Firstly, the story. What I have realized in the course of analyzing and rating British movies of whatever period is a marked tendency of directors to refrain from American defaults such as unrealistic and boastful stories and lavish applications of visual and special effects. The strengths of British movies rather lie in subtle and authentic elaborations on individual struggles and honest depictions of real challenges and hardships. Billy Elliot is an apt example for this premise. The way Daldry elaborates on this basic concept makes his adaptation of the script a unique transformation of the aforementioned features. Billy Elliot's story is elementary and lacks tangly implications, but that is its strength. It does not need terrific special effects to create the story of a young boy finding out who he is and what his talents are, thus delivering a sincere message everyone will be able to identify with. Billy's story serves as the archetypical struggle of finding your place in the world and accepting yourself as the first lesson of getting along with the challenges of life. The movie then acquires its supreme quality by elaborating on Billy's developments, the hardships they imply and the frictions they cause within his family.Secondly, the characters. Starting from this firm basis, the emphases of movies belonging to this genre are put upon individual characters. Here it takes genuine and decent personalities to match the challenges of portraying both the cursory characteristics and the emotional implications of the key characters. The main challenge at the very outset was to find a kid from the Newcastle area with suitable attributes, the right age and the dancing skills necessary to fulfill the movie's requirements. Jamie Bell was cast among two thousand other kids his age. It became very clear that he was the perfect guy to play Billy. It requires a lot of character and endurance to go through the training necessary for this movie, and even more to dance in front of so many people. Jamie is able to make us feel his character's passion and his fervor never to give up on his dreams. His performance is outstanding, he acts confidently like an experienced actor and makes you forget that he is a newcomer.What puts this movie above the ordinary is the quality of the other characters. Billy's family is a family almost torn apart by the death of his mother, which left his father emotionally crippled and his brother unable to take any form of responsibility. At the very beginning you have Billy's father (played by veteran Gary Lewis) as a flat and inapproachable man who seems to be able to beat the living daylights out of Billy once he realizes his son's preference for ballet, which is perfectly unmanly according to him. Billy's brother, Tony, is introduced as a somewhat foolish guy whose entire interest circles around the mining strike. The atmosphere within the family is bleak and emotionally drained.Billy is isolated and yearning for love and appreciation. He visits his mother's grave and takes care of his grandma. He seems, right at the beginning, to be the only one who really takes responsibility despite the hardships of life. The striking thing about him is his determination and sturdiness when it comes to pursuing his dancing courses, which is a remarkable feature for an eleven year old boy, especially when you consider a) his dad's obvious contempt and b) feeling like a sissy himself at the outset. The movie builds on this general strength of Billy, which can be seen in his eyes and is reflected in his eagerness to proceed.As the movie continues the emotional challenges for all the actors slowly but surely grow. Some sequences are stirring in their simplicity and heart-breaking in their subtle sincerity. The bond Billy establishes with his dancing teacher; the scene when she reads the letter of Billy's mom; his father's stand against his own union when it comes to go to the mines again; Tony's change from a frigid dummy to a caring brother. The scene when Tony runs after his father to the mines, and then both men tumble while embracing each other, sobbing in despair, is one of the strongest scenes I have ever seen. An adult man, father of two sons, breaking down and crying ""We're done, son! We're done"" is just smashing, showing the despair and the bottled-up emotions. The changes that the characters undergo manifest themselves in this scene. Thus the characters become even more vivid and make Billy's family as authentic as the movie requires.The dancing is wonderful. The movie is funny as well and made me laugh several times. The language is rather vulgar and the characters very often engage in streams of curses, but this again strengthens the authenticity of the performances. The setting is Northern England in 1984, during the great mining strikes, which plays a significant part in the story itself.Let yourself be inspired by the pervasive message of finding your talents and staying true to yourself. Enjoy the emotionally stirring scenes which will make your heart run over with emotions. Watch out for the unique soundtrack and Billy's outstanding dancing performances.You will love ""Billy Elliot"" for what it has accomplished. It is indeed one of the finest pieces of British cinema, a masterpiece of lasting quality.",Billy Elliot

112,victor7754,A film that will make you Va Clemped,10,9 April 2006,"Rather Unknown 14 year old actor Jamie Bell portrays the title character, Billy Elliot. Bell carries the weight of the film on one foot. The film sets up the obvious with Billy's plight but never the less, it captures the heart and spirit of the viewer and is an inspiration to those young hopefuls who want to do more than dream.Director Stephen Daldry sets up the obstacles splendidly. He creates an environment of strife and conflict brought about by the institutions of society. Billy Elliot is about following your spirit. It suggests that we get one chance in this life to let our spirits fly. The film is set in Ireland during a coal strike that has Billy's dad and brother full of pride as they stand off against the union. Billy's grandmother symbolizes the state of mind that happens when we let that one chance of flying be taken away by the institutions.Jamie Bell dances on rooftops and in the streets without the Hollywood influence that plaqued Footloose. The film touches on individuality and the outside forces that seek to take it away. The film has tender moments of sexual identity. Billy Elliot grabs the heart from the start and does not let go even after the last shot. It is a powerful film that provokes the spirit of the viewer as well their tear ducts.",Billy Elliot
113,PaulLondon,Crowd pleasing kitchen sink drama,7,26 October 2000,"""Billy Elliot"" is shaping up to be this year's ""The Full Monty"" although, fortunately, it does not share that film's belief that a naked man is intrinsically hilariously funny. The director manages to walk a thin line between the feel good factor of young Billy's striving to become a dancer and the almost Loachian portrayal of a Northern town during the '84 miners strikes. It is in this balance that the film is most successful; at times the scenes of the family under pressure are extremely moving-as are the more obviously ""tear-jerker"" scenes of Billy struggling to be understood by his gruffly macho older brother and dad. Any flaws probably come in the somewhat broad characterisations-(we have all seen Julie Walters' heavy smoking, cynical Northern women too many times now) but overall this is an enjoyable feel-good movie with enough grit to stop the terminal cutesies setting in.",Billy Elliot
114,Juni78ukr,Simply excellent,10,22 November 2004,"I have been looking for Billy Elliot for more than two years. I heard that it should be very good or even excellent film and another reason for watching it was that I have seen several Working Title films before (About a Boy, Notting Hill, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral) and I found all of them much more sincere and emotional than average Hollywood products. Also these British films have something to offer that you rarely can find in Hollywood movies: a charming heartwarming mixture of sweet and funny comedy and inspiring and touching drama. Last month, finally, I found the tape. From very first moments of the movie my eyes were riveted to the screen and when the movie ended feelings and emotions overflowed me. Billy Elliot in my opinion Billy Elliot is a brilliant movie, easily one of the best movies of the year and most likely of the current decade.Director of the movie Stephen Daldry brought to us an exceptional, truly inspiring and moving, emotional and poignant movie. The entire story and all the characters are completely believable and the atmosphere of small provincial town somewhere in North-Eastern England skillfully captured and transmitted to us. Sometimes the movie is sad, sometimes it's funny but Stephen Daldry's work never leave you indifferent. The story occurs in a small coal-mining town in 1984 and there are signs of a severe depression all over the town. You can see all around a shadow of distress and even poverty. Some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring to us sad feeling of hopelessness and even despair. There is a big coalminers strike in the town but it's easy to see that it's also the hopeless strike. But all this is only a masterfully recreated background for main story of the title character, a twelve years old boy. He recently lost his mother and both his father and elder brother are striking coalminers. Billy is forced by his father to attend boxing classes and one day accidentally he see the girl ballet classes that occur in same room and he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing. So he attends those ballet classes instead the boxing and there is nothing surprising that after a few weeks his father suddenly finds out that Billy didn't attend boxing and worst of all he is attending the ballet classes. The main conflict occurs.Billy must fight for his choice, fight against his own family. There are two stereotypes against him. First one is that ballet for girls, not for boys (lads do football... or boxing... or wrestling). And second sounds even worse: all male ballet dancers are gays. Billy is not but no one from his family except aged grandma want even heard about ballet. There are only two people in the whole town, who support him  middle-aged ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson and his friend Michael, who is the same age as Billy and who found that he is possibly a gay. This gay subplot easily became for conservative audience a very controversial question. But the fact is that such stereotypes are not invented by the director of the movie and if you would try to learn more about this terrific picture you will found that Jamie Bell, who took dance lessons from age six, suffered from similar sneers and taunts. Billy's problem is that he must fight not only against bad obstacles and misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes. Several brilliant come scenes and bright humor greatly emphasize the struggles of the main hero.Jamie Bell playing Billy has on of the best performances ever among young actors. His performance (and particularly dance sequences) is so genuine, bright and sincere that all the time we can easily feel an expression of a young boy, not a director, choreographer or writer. BAFTA award for best actor of the year is well-deserved and it is pity that conservatism of the Academy too often becomes an insuperable obstacle for many great movies. Julie Walters (an Academy nomination for best supporting actress) as Billy's ballet teacher also did a great job as a talented woman as a talented women who forced to teach in small provincial town for pitiful salary. The chemistry between teacher and student is another great line in Billy Elliot. Two other important supporting characters  Billy's father and elder brother Tony are also excellent and their evolution is perfectly showed by Stephen Daldry's direction. The beautiful soundtrack is a perfect combination of a classic (including a nice reference to great Swan Lake) and modern music.The original ""R"" rating shouldn't mislead you. Except for strong language it should be easily a PG-13. But this is a very rare case where some strong language and profanity are necessary for authenticity and characters understanding. The movie is suitable for teens and it definitely is able to give some good lessons for them.10 out of 10 looks well deserved. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English",Billy Elliot

My most emotional moments were when he had to burn his wife's piano, when he decided to go back to work, when he went to the pawn shop.

The movie flows from one problem to the next and eventually everything works itself out.  This is a film that makes you want to scream to let this young boy dance, and then fight to let those dreams come true.  This movie does not screw you in the end with some kind of short change REALITY ending.  If I want REALITY I can call my parents on the telephone any day of the week.

I bought this movie on DVD a long ago and watched it just now and I feel i had missed a very good movie. I recommend this movie to every one.Every one who has aim,goal and bad circumstances. Performance of Jamie was excellent he deserved Oscar nod. Inshort its a very well directed movie with a nice subject. Thumbs Up. AS Critic: 85/100 General : 90/100 Every parent should watch it.The movie has unique direction and it deserves TOP 250. Ending could've better thats all my opinion on the whole movie. This is one of the most precious movies of all the time.",Billy Elliot
118,Naughtia_Nah,A captivating story about an unusual boy,6,1 September 2011,I was not impressed by this movie's trailer but I actually liked it quite a bit when I started watching it. The story is captivating and the acting was great.An 11 year old boy stumbles upon a ballet class and immediately gets fascinated by it. He joins the ballet class and must go through a lot of resistance from his family's who has a another set of ways. This boy must struggle to get his way and is indeed very talented. A very touching story which makes one think about the choices you make in life and how to make your own way towards the things you want to do.This movie is definitely worth to watch.,Billy Elliot

120,johnrp-1,"A truly pleasant, funny, heart warming film.",9,24 December 2002,"This is not the movie to see if you want shoot 'em up, big explosions, laser beams and blood and guts. No special effects to speak of. Just great acting and a still greater plot. The characters are priceless and the only thing I regretted in the movie was it not being longer. I've never considered ballet so manly before .. okay, I still don't, but the ballet dancing is really a small part of the movie. What comes out in huge bold letters is the will power of a child to achieve his dreams. If only everyone were so driven by a lust for life, what a world this would be! Billy Eliot is definitely one for the must-have collection!",Billy Elliot
121,Matt73,About Being Yourself...,9,2 April 2001,"This is an excellent movie, well, with just one flaw: too many dirty words! Maybe it's just the reality thingy, who knows?Anyway, this movie is about growing up differently from others. Little Billy finds himself more interested to ballet than boxing, but his family of course are against him.He finally stands up for himself and believes that he should be himself no matter what people say. Maybe that's why they chose Stephen Gately from Boyzone to sing the theme song...This movie is also about family values, which makes it quite a moving one. I don't know why it wasn't nominated in Best Picture category for Oscar. It's definitely a Best Picture material because it's better than ""Chocolat"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".Jamie Bell is great as Billy Elliot and he also should've been nominated for Best Actor because I think he's better than Russell Crowe.All in all, it's a great movie that deserves an award!",Billy Elliot
122,cooper-29,Wonderful!,9,20 January 2001,"I had seen the commercials and they emphasize the dancing aspect of the story which is great but there is so much more to this movie. It deals with death and it touches on Mens feelings of loss and what a Man is and even deals a bit with homosexuality. Theres not many times where I sit though the end credits anymore but I was mesmorized. I laughed in this movie and I cried too. The dance scenes were terrific too. The boy who played Billy should get an award hands down for this movie. I watched the emotion on his face and it was amazing. This is the best breakout performance by a young boy since haley Joel Osmant in Sixth Sense. I have to say I just loved Julie Walters too. Where has she been since Educating Rita. Inspite of the swear words this is a movie that families should see. Its hard to believe this gets an R rating and movies like Scary Movie get...only R ratings.  I dont get it. Strange that two of my favorite recent movies are from the British...This and Croupier. Word to Hollywood, make more movies like this or at lease import more like this. Dont miss this one!",Billy Elliot

The boy doesn't realize his talent without the help of his teacher Mrs. Wilkinson who sees him as a potential ballet dancer in the future, and believes that working in the mines like his father and brother will kill his dream. A delightful comedy with Billy's grandmother who still dreams that she can always be a professional dancer despite the circumstances that have forced her to live in that community, so it's her fate which she cannot escape. It's a great movie with lots of beautiful and unforgettable moments between Billy and his family and friends.",Billy Elliot
125,maxmik,"you laugh, you cry",10,4 November 2000,"This is small gem of a movie that the British, French and Italian film industries specialize in. In other words, it's not a product of a big American conglomerate. This movie is about as far away from something like Scream 3 or Lethal Weapon 4 as you can get. It's the kind of movie Disney wishes they could make. Beautifully photographed, written and directed - the film contains two astonishing performances - one by a newcomer Jamie Bell in his first feature film as 11 year old Billy Eliott and one by his ballet teacher and mentor Julie Waters who hasn't had this good a role in many a moon. Don't wait for the crowds - go see it now - so when you laugh and when you cry - you won't disturb the people next to you. Leave the kids at home - it's rated R for language.",Billy Elliot
126,rastaban3,Good heart warming film.,8,7 June 2001,"This one displays all troubles of a young boy who struggles to find what makes him happy.  He wants to please his father by joining a boxing club but finds he just doesn't have the knack for it.  He later finds his calling in ballet.  His father is disgusted by this, which creates the croundum of his young life.  This one presents the plot very well and it keeps you interested.  This film also displays the problems the English coal mining community experienced during the strikes.  This places even more conflict into the mix.  All of this together, makes for a good film about life's hard lessons.  Even with all of th is, this is not the type of film I particularly like. However, since it was very well presented and very believably, I have to admit, this is a good one.Overall, definitely worth your while, (8 out of 10).",Billy Elliot
127,silviopellerani,It's hard to grew up in a miner town,7,15 May 2001,"Definitively England cinema is having a sort of ""British renaissance"" compared to some others European cinema industries. This beautiful film about a sad story of a ""different likings"" boy grew up in a miner town full of strikes in the middle of the Thatcher age teaches you a lot on how difficult is to fight countercurrent against a town and against of a lot of prejudices and stereotypes behind the ballet and its environment.Beautifully performed by Jimmie Bell as Billy Elliot and Julie Walters, his ballet teacher, film goes slowly but effective into the child mind searching and discovering all details about his strong personality. The sociopolitical frame is well printed in the film.Rating: 7/10",Billy Elliot
128,MovieCritic20497,Spectacular,7,13 January 2004,This is by far THE BEST PICTURE OF 2000. Billy Elliot is apiring to be a ballet dancer. He proves that it doesn't mean you're gay if you join a ballet class. Billy Elliot gives all men the courage to dance.,Billy Elliot
129,ICanNeverThinkOfAGoodUsername,Average film...,5,18 September 2014,This film made me laugh and cry and overall it was an average film. I would have rated it higher if the storyline would have been developed more. I think the acting was really good and the storyline didn't show off the acting as well as it could have done.This is a famous film but I don't feel it's that good. It's okay. It's something you'd watch if nothing else was on not something you'd specially make time for. I really do think it could have been a lot better. The ending lets down this film apart from that it's not too bad.SPOILERS AHEAD: 1. One minute Billy's Dad hates the idea of him doing ballet and the next minute he's fine with it - this definitely should have been developed more.2. Why did his brother suddenly agree to it? 3. Why didn't Billy tell his ballet teacher? Why was there awkwardness between to them at the end? 4. We never actually knew of any Billy's feelings towards ballet...,Billy Elliot
130,fiozinho,Smashing!,7,21 February 2001,"'Kes' meets 'Brassed Off' meets 'Flashdance' ... but for all its derivativeness, 'Billy Elliot' manages to come up smelling as fresh as a great big bunch of dewy roses. A lot of it is down to some marvellous performances, notably the astonishing Jamie Bell (Oscar, where art thou?) but there is also excellent writing here: the relationship between Billy and his Dad requires double-strength Kleenex; setting the story at the time of the 1984 miners' strike is a master-stroke. But at the heart of the film's success is the glowing beacon of young Billy's ambition, drawing us to the most magnificent of conclusions. Every year British cinema comes up with a gem. This is the latest.",Billy Elliot
131,matt caccamo,3.5 out of 5 stars,6,2 February 2002,"England in the 1980s was the time of Margaret Thatcher, labor unrest, and the political shouting matches-not dancing.  This does little to stop Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), the son and brother of two striking coal miners in a working class town in northern England.  Not cut out for the boxing his father has signed him up for, Elliot realizes he has a special talent for dance and joins a ballet group at the local gym.  Being the only boy in the class and the only male ballet student in town does not bother Billy, but it does bother his macho father (Gary Lewis), who is dealing with the loss of his wife and the downtrodden existence of mining.  While most around him equate dancing with homosexuality, Billy persists in his desire to dance, spurned along by the local dance teacher (Julie Waters) and a desire to make it out of his poor mining town into the Royal Ballet School.  `Billy Elliot' overcomes a slow, formulaic start to provide an inspirational tale about determination and doing what you love.  While some of the characters are given short shrift, Elliot is a wonderfully developed young boy with a talent no one gives him credit for.  It brings some laughs but is more correctly described as an important fable on the pursuit of dreams.",Billy Elliot
132,moysant,Not that good.,4,7 February 2005,"*Some Spoilers* Spoiled by some poor acting and unappealing characters, particularly the Billy of the piece and his older brother and father. How am I suppose to feel uplifted with such men? There transformation to being supportive of Billy was unconvincing.Its tone was confused - politically biting, tragic, inspiring? It ended up being none. It was all laid on too thickly at times. Characters that were far more interesting were glossed over - Billy's transvestite friend, the sassy daughter of Billy's dance teacher (and 'girlfriend'), his dancing teacher coping with her home life.Some scenes were just overplayed and so lost their impact. Eg, the police invasion, Billy's sudden tap dancing up the street (which didn't make sense since he was learning Ballet, not tap). However, I did enjoy the scenes with the strikers waiting for the 'scabs' buses. The atmosphere of the town was fantastic as well.Messy and uneven but the central premise that machismo and brute force will fail when up against inner strength and passion was good to see in a movie (so rare these days).",Billy Elliot
133,Pikchar,Not Just About Ballet,8,5 July 2001,"I learn ballet, and my whole ballet class went together to watch the movie, knowing it was about dancing. But we soon found out that that's not all it's about. Jamie Bell deserves all praise for his intense performance. Gary Lewis and Julie Walters were excellent as well. In fact, the whole cast was excellent - it was flawless acting from all. The Soundtrack is also worth mentioning.",Billy Elliot
134,mar9,Cinderella in Struggletown,8,17 March 2002,"A boy from the wrongest possible side of the tracks gets his chance at stardom of an unexpected kind in this feelgood British film. Set against the backdrop of the miners' strikes during the darkest years of Thatcherism makes for some interesting contrasts as we see Billy and his fellow children seemingly oblivious to the menacing circumstances that they live in. Some fun moments arise from this - the scene where Billy walks along the street chatting with Debbie, oblivious to a rank of riot police on one side, is a delight.Jamie Bell is the child star who does a good job of making Billy believeable. One bit didn't work for me - the scene in the dressing room after Billy's audition, I'll say no more, except that this for me was a device to artificially pile on tension in the film at the risk of credibility - this is the one time in the whole film where Billy behaves completely out of character. I also wonder what happened to Billy's oversized ears by film's end - it's a bit hard to reconcile Bell with the adult that plays the grown-up Billy. Oh, well.For mine, the best actor in this film is Stuart Wells who gives a riveting performance as Billy's best friend Michael. The rest of the cast are generally very good also - flawed, real people, no Hollywood mannequins here. Perhaps a bit too real - the Northern accents are so impenetrable at times that this film could do with subtitles. A bit too much T-Rex in the soundtrack too, particularly since one T-Rex song is usually too many. But minor quibbles aside this is an enjoyable film.",Billy Elliot
135,ninoguapo,A must see !,10,28 December 2005,"A must see  Billy Elliot is a real masterpiece and is one of my all time favorite movies. I found a lot of inspiration in the movie and somehow it reminded me of my own life. The movie encourages people to believe in themselves and follow their dreams. In addition it sends the message that people should be who they are  not what others expect them to be.There is drama, there is humor - I could hardy think of anything else that can be included in a movie. Some scenes brought tears in my eyes, others made me laugh  I guess it is just because I associated with Billy while watching the movie  but somehow I felt the scenes almost like if I was there.Jamie Bell plays exceptionally well the role of Billy, which is probably because he had similar fate (according to himself in an interview I have read somewhere). But it is not only him  all the actors have done an outstanding job.I highly recommend this movie. It easily gets 10 out of ten from me.",Billy Elliot
136,mmunies,"Passionate, engrossing story overcomes cliches",8,29 October 2000,"I'm not sure why this film is being compared to the Full Monty other than the fact that it involves folks from Northern England.  The films are quite different.  Billy Elliot is a movie just chock full of cliches but instead of being a bore, it's a wonderful film.  The main reason is that the passion and sincerity behind this film is amazing.  The acting by Jamie Bell is outstanding and is one of the main reasons to see this movie. 
I was completely engrossed in this film even though I knew how it would turn out and the characters are pretty stereotypical in many ways. 
Just goes to show you how long you can go with a fundamentally good story, great acting, good direction, and actually caring more about the film than making money.",Billy Elliot
137,formicidae,Pretty solid,7,14 August 2001,"Why someone described this movie as funny (testimonial on movie poster) is beyond me, unless they typically find stories about poverty stricken miners, dead mothers, and labor turmoil to be humorous. Billy Elliot is a good movie, but it is not the funny, heartwarming movie experience I expected. Heartwarming maybe, funny at times, but this should not be a prime descriptor of the film.The acting is quite good, the characters are believable and interesting, and the story is charming. I especially enjoyed the sub-plot of the labor unrest, and felt that it gave the film a depth it otherwise would not have had. And this is perhaps where the film fails somewhat in my opinion--in it's effort to tell a story about a boy's struggle to be able to dance the ""ballee"", the movie only glances at the bigger struggle, and the bigger story, of the miners' union's struggle against management. As much as I like a story about triumph over adversity, it's hard to get too emotionally concerned about a boy's desire to dance when hundreds of working class families are fighting for wages that will feed their children, never mind send them to dance school.I rate the movie a 7 out of 10. It is unquestionably a well done movie, but I ultimately found the priorities of storytelling misplaced, and that hampered the entertainment factor.",Billy Elliot
138,ruthgee,Most enjoyable movie,9,22 November 2000,"First why an R rating?   This movie is well made and the acting excellent. I doubt that this movie would have been made but for the money given to the producer by the English National Lottery, BBC and The Humanities for The Arts.  This is an old fashioned movie with a heart.  I loved every minute of it.  Jamie Bell was outstanding as Billy.  The rest of the cast were equally good.  What I did notice, a school uniform makes everyone look equal, even someone as poor as Billy.  Does anyone know who the Ballet performer was who came on at the end of the movie - what a wonderful leap!",Billy Elliot
139,delibebek,Finding beauty,7,27 August 2009,"""Billy Elliot"" isn't about a boy wanting to dance. It isn't about a miners' strike in the mid-1980s. These are only the elements which happen to be chose to tell this story. The story is about finding beauty in the world, finding it despite the chaos and conformity that surrounds youth.Billy, through the course of the movie, struggles to find his own direction in life at a very young age. It's quite easy to understand this because of the choices of setting and character made for the sake of the story.Billy is relatively young, making him subject to the pressures of his father and older brother. The time and place of the story, with police riot squads being a fixture on the streets, underscores the difficulty in being drawn to ballet, an activity not considered fitting among his family and peers. Still he pursues his passion.The performances paint the picture perfectly. They are convincing and compelling renditions of the characters in this light, enjoyable drama.",Billy Elliot
140,Petie3-2,Brilliant,9,29 April 2001,"For a similar tour d'force see also Empire of the Sun with Christian Bale who greatly resembles Jamie Bell.

Most finely played out exploration of  emotional relationships since ""Second Best.""",Billy Elliot
141,emurray-2,Billy Elliot is great!,10,9 May 2001,"Billy Elliot was even better the second time in the privacy of my home. Although the under-educated family frequently use four-letter words, Billy is able to get away from the possibility of coal mining to find ""electricity"" through his hobby of dancing which is fulfilled when he is given the opportunity to study ballet at the Royal College of Ballet in London.  I was exhilarated by seeing the movie on DVD.  It is a truly grand motion picture.",Billy Elliot
142,Sees All,Sweet little movie,8,23 December 2000,"The film has moment of exhilaration when the acting, direction, editing, musical score and camera work all come together superbly.  I found myself weeping unexpectedly in many places throughout the film.  Some elements did not work for me, like the presence of the old granny and both young Debbie's and young Michael's attempts to seduce Billy.  Nor are all the attempts at humor 100% successful.  But these are minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things.  On the whole this was a very enjoyable movie.  Special huzzahs for actors Julie Walters (all too rare on the screen since Educating Rita) as Billy's dance teacher, Gary Lewis as Billy's poor beleaguered father, and the amazingly natural child performer, Jamie Bell in the title role.  This is definitely one of 2000's best films.  The British dialects may be hard for most Americans to understand, but I'd still recommend it to intelligent adult filmgoers.",Billy Elliot
143,Robin Kelly,Average,1,29 September 2000,"Lee Hall has written acclaimed stage plays, radio plays and TV movies.  So how has his talent transferred to the big screen?  If you are in the right frame of mind then his film is a feel-good breath of fresh air.  But you have to be willing to ignore some major flaws.The central premise of a boy discovering dance with the coal dispute of 1984 in the background is a good one.  The strike gives an original twist to what is a simple bog-standard rites-of-passage story but it doesn't really complement the main story.  There are a couple of times where the strike affects what Billy wants; the first time to do with the audition and his brother is unconvincing and strange.  The second time to do with the audition and his father is brilliant but then goes nowhere as it has no consequences which is simply unbelievable.For the rest of the film the strike seems more like extraneous conflict to bring in action when Billy learning dancing gets too boring. There were lots of conflicts relating to Billy and his relationships they could have used instead which would have kept the film more focussed but instead they decided to keep the characterisations shallow and go for the big irrelevant event.In fact, we don't really get to know any of the characters that well especially Billy's father and brother.  They start out by hating Billy  - which is bizarre and never explained - so the subsequent inevitable coming together seems completely unconvincing.  We also see Billy resolving a particular conflict with his ballet teacher at the end but he had no conflict with her to resolve.  It was his father's conflict, Billy had nothing to do with it.  This relationship with the teacher is crucial but isn't dealt with properly just so the focus can move to the father.  To be fair a lot of these problems could have been in the directing or editing rather than in the writing.Hall does veer away from schmaltz, which is to his credit, but he does it mainly by having the characters swear a lot.  But in the main the dialogue is very good and nothing made me cringe, which is good considering the story.The first act is good and then the usual second act problems happen but this is meant to get better again when the third act kicks in but the film actually gets worse scene by scene ending with a stupid embarrassing flash forward.Stephen Daldry makes his directorial debut and is already being held on a par with Sam Mendes, a fellow theatre director turned movie director.  I simply don't see it. Like Mendes, he coaxes excellent performances from the cast. Unlike Mendes, in all other aspects, his direction was disappointing - to say the least.I really wanted to like - and expected to like - Billy Elliot and compared to many recent British films, it's good but it simply isn't good enough.",Billy Elliot
144,bryant52,"Clever idea, excellent performance, but...",6,1 August 2001,not what it could have been or should have been.  Unfortunately predictable from beginning to end....a British SchoolBoy Flashdance (without the catchy tunes) constructing an unbelievable character (though the lead actor did an outstanding job with limited material) dealing with an unbelievable series of artificial situations.,Billy Elliot
145,Britlaw,Liberating repressions,8,15 October 2000,"This may contain spoilers.For the first time for many years this hard boiled cynic had a tear in his eye at the cinema!Other have given plot outlines so I won't do that. This boy is just fantastic in his portrayal of Billy, a boy on the edge of starting to discover all that there is in this game we call life. His dancing is pretty uncoordinated but he's got a fire which burns in him telling him to do it and his dance teacher, Julie Walters with fag constantly in hand, sees this too.One of these life discoveries is to start throwing off what represses you, in this case a blinkered family and social structure that couldn't see firstly that life isn't all the pit, drinking and boxing or secondly that mines have to be closed if there is no coal in them, and however much you strike you can't change that. The saddest line was when Billy is asked if he's been to the magnificent gothic Durham Cathedral as his village is very near there and says he'd never been taken. Billy is surprised to that his father (who sports a Glaswegian accent) has never been to London.Luckily the miners strike was only a back drop to the story, but for our foreign readers the strike was called by the largely Communist leadership of the miners union without a ballot as a result of which led to only about two thirds of miners striking. The strike had little public support outside the mining areas who responded as one would expect with great violence to those who did continue to exercise the right to work and who naturally asked for police protection. Only Mr Wilkinson on the film hints at the background to the strike.This is an unashamedly feel good movie which should win some Oscars. Billy's cross dressing friend has the best line in the whole thing though. Billy: 'Why have you got a dress on?' Friend: 'Oh, my Dad does it all the time.' And where do they find those grim locations?8/10 from me, which is very high, I've only ever given a few films 9 and none 10, though 'Elizabeth' got close.",Billy Elliot
146,Bob_647,Heart touching gruffy drama set against the 1984-5 Miners' strike,9,21 June 2020,"It is also a piece of magic realism, with political overtones. By setting their near fairy tale in the context of a close-knit mining community, and more specifically against the backdrop of the 1984-5 miners' strike - a defining moment of modern British economic and social history - writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry are able to refer to gender and class issues, without turning their work into a political tract, and without losing focus on the central human drama.Quite simply, this is the best British movie in years. All the characters are intriguing, and the acting is flawless, most notably from 14-year-old Jamie Bell whose acting is utterly convincing, filled with humor and insight beyond his years. He is also a fantastic dancer, and some of the dance sequences are reminiscent of the dance-filled musicals of the old black and white movies.Lewis and Draven put gritty realism and passion into their roles of a father and son committed to their community and to the miners' cause. They make us feel their despair as they realize that this cause is lost; but also their endurance as they come to terms both with Billie's aspirations and their own uncertain futures - within a few years most UK coalmines would be closed. (The colliery in Easington, the real-life location of the film, closed in 1994.). The scenes of violence between strikers and police are presented uncompromisingly and authentically, but with the occasional touch of humor.Julie Walters provides an outstanding performance as Mrs Wilkinson, the dancing teacher who recognizes and fosters Billie's talent; and helps him resist his own and his family's inhibitions. She is perfect as the chain smoking, straight talking mentor, who has her own personal disappointments and hurts, which she hopes Billie's success will help heal. To we outsiders watching the movie, Mrs Wilkinson appears as an integral part of the local community; but it is made clear that in the middle 1980s, as far as Billie's family and friends are concerned, she is a middle class outsider, almost as alien as another species.the movie is as much parable and fantasy as it is realistic. The character of the transvestite Michael in particular seems based more on wishful thinking than on plausible reality; would a gay boy of his age in this neighborhood of this town in 1984 be quite so sure of himself? Julie Walters, a 1984 Academy Award nominee for ""Educating Rita,"" is spirited and colorful as the ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis is somehow convincing as the dad even when the screenplay requires him to make big off screen swings of position. Jamie Bell is an engaging Billy, earnest and high-spirited, and a pretty good dancer, too.The movie was directed by Stephen Daldry, a well-known stage director, and photographed by Brian Tufano, who has one shot that perfectly illustrates the difference between how children and adults see the world. Billy's friend Debbie is walking along a fence, clicking a stick against the boards. She doesn't notice that she is suddenly walking in front of a line of cops, called up against the striking miners and carrying plastic shields; she clicks on those, too.No wonder critics have been falling over themselves in heaping praise on Billy Elliot. No wonder it's been holding its own in the box office despite being shown in a mere handful of theaters (one quarter to one sixth as many as the big Hollywood blockbusters) and despite its receiving hardly any promotion at the moment. Its success is being driven by word of mouth. And what is the word? Here is a movie that appeals to your heart, head, funny bone, eyes and ears, and last but not least your feet, for the music and the movement will have you wanting to get up and dance. And it achieves all of this without insulting the intelligence. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been done by Hollywood: Billy would have been made a more pathetic figure; the people in his life rendered more black and white; characters would have either remained caricatures, or made to develop in the blink of an eye. All such excesses are avoided in Billy Elliot, where the characters develop in a totally believable way, where Billy invites admiration instead of pity, and where the silences, looks and gestures all leave so much to the imagination. The dictum ""Less is more"" is clearly the guiding principle behind the film.The buzz for Billy has been so positive that people sometimes come away disappointed that their lives haven't been changed. So don't go expecting a knock them dead Hollywood roller coaster. Billy Elliot is far more subtle, though the emotional moments are all the more powerful because of that. You can however believe everything that has been said of Jamie Bell. He has an outstanding screen presence and carries the movie on his little shoulders with breath taking naturalism. His dancing is honest and powerful, and very masculine. He makes you forget that all the other actors give the performances of their careers in support. If the Oscar were awarded without consideration for age, career, box office draw or Hollywood clout, Jamie and his movie would win hands down.One issue which the film tackles head-on is traditional heterosexual male abhorrence of homosexuality. This attitude clearly underlies the shock of Billie's father and brother when they discover his interest in ballet. They would be even more horrified if they realized that his best friend was discovering gay tendencies in himself. It is typical of the sensitive direction that without laboring the point the film indicates by its close that attitudes towards gays changed radically during the 1980s and 90s along with the industrial landscape.I went into this movie expecting to hate it, and found myself instantly smiling at the playful opening credits with Billy jumping on a trampoline. From there on it just got better and better. The wasn't even a minor character that I could say needed work. The cast as a whole was brilliant - and surprising at times. The father and brother come off as these one-sided brutal characters in the beginning and then as you watch, they become two of the most well constructed and acted characters this year and for who knows how long. Jaime Bell is brilliant for a first-timer and his dance is wonderful. There are also so many layers to the film. From brilliant cinematography to wonderful symbolism both in the script and in the music (listen for the tune Billy is playing on piano in the main score during the big moments). The music on a whole was brilliantly picked and I don't think a single element was overlooked or addressed. If you haven't seen this movie get off your butt & see it! It is truly an experience that everyone should have and I hope to see more from this writer, director and a brilliant new face in Jamie Bell.",Billy Elliot

148,enjoyuk,"One word ""Fantastic""",9,3 October 2000,"Billy Elliot is a class act all the way, everybody involved in the production of this fine film deserve the highest accolades.  Im glad to see the great response of some US users of IMDB. I grew up in similar surroundings to the title character and would have been around the same age during this period and I have to say that the filmmakers have created the time and atmosphere of Northern England in the early 1980s to perfection.  I wish the very best of success to this production and hope that more viewers around the world can see and enjoy a truer slice of English life than the (not to take anything away from these films) ""Notting Hill's"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" portrait of the UK. Utterly a Top Notch production.",Billy Elliot
149,craigboney,Absolutely stunned,7,4 December 2000,"Billy Elliot is the story of a young lad from the North-East of England in the early 1980s whose Mother has passed away and is being brought up by his Father & Brother.  Both are Miners involved in the strikes.  Beyond that, I advise you to go and see it yourself!Slow at the start, but once into the meat and bones of the story you set off on an emotional rollercoaster.  Incredibly poignant scenes are immediately followed by brazen comic sequences.  The fruity language throughout helps with the realism as you feel that in other hands, this could've been Disney material.  As I was growing up at a similar time, a lot of this rings true, and lots of childhood memories came flooding back (some nice, some long forgotten) and I was a gibbering wreck by the end.  There are plenty of amazing characters in this, from the hothead brother, the senile Gran and the effeminate boy down the road who has a paricularly soft spot for Billy.Absolutely stunning.  If you like this, then I recommend The Straight Story, the only film of recent years to have a similar emotional effect on me.",Billy Elliot
150,padres01,One of My All-Time Favorites,10,9 January 2013,"The mark of a truly great film is its ability to transport you to another part of the world and make you truly care about the characters, their lives, and their daily struggles.Billy Elliot is just such a film. I saw it years ago (even before it was turned into a hit Broadway musical), and instantly fell in love with it. I've watched it several times again when it's aired on cable TV. What a gem of a little movie, and what a richly woven screenplay by Lee Hall. What a legacy of love for his native England. This movie is, on a lot of levels, Mr. Hall's love letter to his country.Be prepared to fall in love with England, the English, and especially, Billy Elliot. This movie paints a broad portrait about humanity with many universal experiences. At the same time, it is an intimate glimpse into what makes the English English, and endearingly so. I loved the sweeping scenes of striking coal miners, the multigenerational relationships, the dashed hopes and dreams, and the lilting hope of a young boy who wants nothing more than to dance, dance, dance.To the lucky who have not yet seen this film: You are in for a huge treat. Enjoy.",Billy Elliot
151,Cinebuff38,A waste of a good idea,5,5 January 2016,"In my personal experience, most films that have come with a lot of hype and where critics have waxed lyrically of them I have found somewhat disappointing. Unfortunately, for me, Billy Elliott falls into that category.Not that it is a bad film. one of the problems I have is as with so many British and American films of today, it lacks depth in as much as instead of discussing it's subject, it presents it in an exploratory manner where we see its facade but not entirely what is behind it.Stephen Daldry's film tells the story, with a script by Lee Hall, of a young boy (Jamie Bell) who during a boxing practicing session, witnesses a group of girls being instructed in ballet by dancing tutor Mrs Wilkinson (Julie Walters) which inspires him to take an interest in the discipline.Wilkinson hands him a pair of ballet shoes ( which just happened to be the right size) and invites him to join in. Having developed such a keen interest, and not wanting to upset his apparently bigotry father ( Gary Lewis) Billy decides to cautiously take up the offer.After successfully concealing for some time his newly found ambition from his family, his father finally discovers him in one of Wilkinson's lessons and interrupts the class to display his displeasure,much to the annoyance of Wilkinson.His fathers use of bigotry is for me, A major let down in the film because While it is perfectly acceptable to have an opinion on a given situation or person, the belief of a bigot is usually unreasonable, unfair, biased and without research or foundation. It is because of that criteria we are left with a somewhat shallow film in which instead of going deep into the subject and discussing it thoroughly and therefore making it rich in dialogue, (and such film making today is possible, even in Hollywood. Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight are prime examples) we are left with a vehicle where the father's narrow-mindedness forms a big part of the families dysfunction.Hall's decision to portray the dad as a (striking) miner was Unnecessary as was the grandmothers dementia. The character's pre occupation with the sub plots(and even they did not have much depth) distracted from the main subject in hand.His father finally comes round to the idea of Billy becoming a ballet dancer. It is another part of the films weakness that it does this without any qualified link between the father being anti and pro.Apart from Billy's impromptu thirst for ballet, there was not that much inspiration in the story to warrant him auditioning for and being accepted in its school.Several years later Billy is a young adult (Played by Adam Cooper)(It's amazing that Billy and mike aged while the father hadn't) fully fledged as a ballet dancer and performing in Swan Lake.Bell, Lewis, and Walters played their respective parts convincingly, and did their best with what little they were given, as did all the other actors, but the film was sadly let down by lazy script writing and lack of depth in the characters. This is by no means the fault of the actors but that of the creative team who came up with a good idea and then watered it down with a total lack of character study.",Billy Elliot
152,AJ_Franklin-2,Sort of a fun movie.,6,7 August 2001,"This was an enjoyable, gay little adventure into the life of a young Irish lad. Other than that, and the eventual outcome of this particular lad's love of dance, not much to recommend it, really.

But I thought it was amazing, a beautiful story about a boy trying to hide from his family that he is dancing ballet. I think it is from the 80`s and Billy, his dad and his brother is living in a poor suburb in England, and his dad works in a coal mine. The father and the brother try to get him out of it because it`s a dance for girls, but Billy continues in secret and he become so good that his teacher think his ready to go on an audition! A wonderful movie that I can see again. //Sofia",Billy Elliot
154,rscafanever,Feel-good yet intelligent film,7,17 September 2016,"Set against the backdrop of the strikes at the UK's mines, young boy Billy Elliott discovers his love for dance. He finds opposition within his dysfunctional family but the love isn't set to die out.The most remarkable of this entertaining movie is the young protagonist's (Jamie Bell) performance. It stands out to the others' more hesitant portrayals of struggling individuals.The emotional evolutions the characters undergo sometimes lack credibility. However, it is compensated by the creative depiction of the raw reality of the UK's 1980s. Another strong point is that the film takes the children's point of view. Often insecure, they try to cope with the big and small things in life. At the same time, the adults around them display emotional struggle as they haven't managed to cope.This is no movie for children, despite the character's young age. Interesting themes as family, hopes, unprocessed emotions are mixed together in this enjoyable feel-good movie.",Billy Elliot

Billy's father never went to big city or other place, just live in his small town all his life. If not for Billy, he wouldn't leave awhile and see what looks like in London. To tell the truth, coal miner is really an out of date job and not only one job, there are many kinds of job disappear or appear and we must go on to learn new things or get the fate of being selected. The sadness of His father & brother is, they couldn't do nothing but coal miner.

156,mjcfoxx,Pleasant and Involving First Film by Daldry,8,7 July 2013,"Nobody would understand better what it's like to sort of skirt the line between 'manly' and 'puff' better than Stephen Daldry, who goes by 'gay' despite being happily married to a woman and father to a daughter. He's as gay as he is straight, and in reality, it's like this: he likes what he likes. This film seems an extension of that: the lead (Jamie Bell, in a wonderfully nuanced young adult performance), is just a boy with a lot of energy who finds he's better at channeling it via dance than boxing (as his father would prefer). He's widower father and older brother are striking against the coal mines that won't pay them enough wages and you see a struggle as they grasp to their identity of what it is to be male. (if you can't feed your family, you don't feel like much of a man, do you?). Julie Walters delivers a fine performance as the dance teacher that sees Billy's potential and helps him realize it. Moments that could have been stomach-churning manage to go by like rocks skipping a lake. Transformations don't exactly ring true, but you find yourself more relieved and besides, with what ends up at stake, who has time for such 'trivial' matters?",Billy Elliot
157,george-102,Cliched plot saved by some fine acting,7,6 June 2001,"It's not surprising so many foreigners think Britain is a class-ridden society.  A few years ago the typical British film showed Hugh Grant and various other apparently unemployed filthy rich living the high life, now the fashion is for grimy Northern pictures showing decent working folk being ground down by the forces of conservatism. Well I am British, and I don't recognise either of these stereotypes as being particularly typical of the Britain I know.Of course the story of the miners' strike is an important one, and Billy Elliot does make a good attempt at telling it. But Billy Elliot is primarily supposed to be about a young boy who wants to dance, so what has that got to do with the miners' strike?What I think it's got to do with it is that the script needs a father who is basically decent, but is anti-ballet-dancing.  Now in fact I'll bet that if you walk into a pub anywhere from the West End to the Gorbals, and ask what the men there think of boys doing ballet, you will get some in favour, some against, and some don't knows.  But instead the film patronises the mineworkers by assuming that northern mineworker == conservative (with a small c) =thinks ballet is for ""poofs"".  This is a cliche in the worst sense, because it's a substitute for thinking; the film robs us of the chance to see what really makes Billy Elliot's father anti-ballet, which is never explained.It's also manipulative.  If Billy Elliot was the son of a millionaire and went to Eton, his parents might be just as anti-ballet, and his public-school comrades even more scornful.  But the film puts him in a stereotyped Northern family, because the scriptwriters knew that by doing that they'd tug our heartstrings more.The film is worth seeing because of the acting of Billy Elliot and his dancing teacher, who have a really special and interesting relationship.  But I don't think it deserves to be in the IMDB top 250.",Billy Elliot
158,DanielLowery96,A beautiful story,8,20 March 2019,"Billy Eliot is a beautifully told story, set in Northeastern England during a very difficult time. During the dark years of Thatcherism and miners strike, we can watch a story about a boy that initially defies the expectations of his father and brother and the classical concept of masculinity of the region.

The main character is Billy Elliot. He wants to practice ballet, but to take ballet lessons needs a lot of money. His father doesn't agree with Billy. His father thinks Billy should practice boxing. Billy doesn't want to do it. Also, Billy's landscape is characteristic. In this way, the audience can see the British social system. Second, ballet. Billy's father think ballet is for girls, but actually, ballet needs boys and girls. Ballet duet dance is that boys and girls dance together. Some people don't know about ballet well. Third, family love. After Billy's family agree with Billy dancing ballet, father cooperates with Billy, and helps and cheers up Billy. All members of Billy's family wait for the result.

Well I finally watched it and can't stop watching it!!  The movie makes me laugh, cry, even after the 5th time of seeing it. Great performances!! This movie has a key motor that keeps this movie going, that is Passion. The passion to want to do and be something so much that it can take you anywhere.  The story is written well.  I liked how the conflicts between Billy's family and his passion in dancing parallels.  With dancing he can escape the family troubles he can hardly understand; he can take flight.  I like how the strikes and his struggle parallel and how everything comes to a close in the end.  It is a beautiful movie and so close to the heart (really without sounding corny).  There was a point where my friends and I got up and danced, because thats what the movie made us want to do...now that's true entertainment.",Billy Elliot
162,melissa.ricks,Fabulous Casting! Wonderful Script!,10,30 May 2001,My favorite movie of 2000!  Jamie Bell pulls the entire cast together. What a tremendous find in casting him as Billy Elliot.  He is completely fresh and believable as the awkward 11 year old dancer wanna-be.  The ensemble cast who support him couldn't have been better.And the writing couldn't have been better.  Many well thought out scenes and strong direction enhanced a beautifully written story which contained dialogue subtle and appropriate for each character and scene.  I don't give out 10s easily.

I come from a Billy Elliot-type area - a lot of it was filmed just up the road, in Easington - and all I could see were the tired North-East England cliches of ""hard"" men, the miners' strike, salt of the earth, blah blah blah. I wasn't convinced at all when Billy's dad, having spent half the film calling him a poof, suddenly changed his tune. And Julie Walters' accent was atrocious!

164,imdb-5032,"Unprepossessed, humorous and genuinely moving",9,13 March 2005,"There are so many things that could have gone terribly wrong with this film. It could have turned out as dreary, faux-realist prole-pornography. It could have turned out as a swooning paean on Northern English sensibility, replete with postcard cinematography. It could have turned out as a grimly activist protest against bourgeois conformism and capitalist oppression.It turns out to be an aptly scored, superbly acted and strikingly shot masterpiece. Vividly edited and briskly plotted, we follow young Billy as he fumbles his boxing lessons and discovers ballet during the great miner's strikes in the 80s.The inevitable tension that develops between Billy and his father is played out among a cast of memorable characters: Billy Fane's appearance as the seedy, misanthropic piano player is brief but hilarious; Julie Walters' rendition of the chain-smoking ballet teacher is simply iconic.The depth and detail in this movie evoke countless bittersweet images: the way Billy's gritty neighbourhood is framed so as to show the majestic and tranquil sea in the distance, glistening with Olympian indifference; the menacing, surreal omnipresence of authority in the form of the British police force; the dignified despair of a town library which has been relegated to a mobile home.Unprepossessed, humorous and genuinely moving.",Billy Elliot

166,Auselan,Jamie Bell is a Gene Kelly of the 21st century,9,19 August 2001,"The hero's dream of becoming a ballet dancer is born in the unlikely milieu of County Durham's working class mining community.  This impoverished population of broken dreams and domestic violence is the bleak alternative to, and thereby stimulant for, Billy Elliot's dream.  The action takes place, significantly, during a time of rebellion: the pit miners are on strike because of pit closures.  This violent and brooding subplot is thematically linked to Billy Elliot's struggle against tyrannical sanctions: just as his brother and father resist police enforcement, so he stands up to them.  His rebellion is no less masculine: he defies his father's prohibition and braves physical abuse when caught dancing, proving that Ballet is not just for poufs' but is a dignified profession for those of physical dedication, discipline and courage.The director symbolically conveys the opposition between Billy's values and his father's through an opposition between darkness and light (the white of the swan is to become a symbol of Billy's ambition).  The misery of parental failures is explored during a dark interior scene; yet the next scene, where Billy and his girlfriend cast away sorrows in an amorous play scene, is light and the feathers of the cushion as it splits fill the room with downy whiteness (a visual prelude to the swan's narrative introduction). 
Overlooking the river Wear, Billy's teacher (Julie Walters at her gut-wrenching best) tells him the story of Swan Lake as Tchaikovsky's theme is playing in the background: a beautiful woman is turned into a swan by a wicked magician, but has a few hours every night to be her true self.  This is an important moment for Billy, for he takes on the swan's story as a correlative for his own plight: like the swan he has a limitted time set aside in his day (the dance classes) in which to express his true self. 
Downy snow is falling like swan feathers in the Christmas scene and Billy is building a snow man with his friend; this is an image of hope and creativity(which is later urinated on by a drunken miner); rebuilding dreams as well as building the white snow man (Billy's friend is convincing him to try his luck at Ballet again).  It is as if the universality of the snow and all it stands for gives Billy the confidence to re-assert his ambition, for when his father catches him this time, he is not so passive.  He gives a muscular virile, even acrobatic, dance performance for his father in an awe-inspiring gesture of defiance.    Jamie Bell is a Gene Kelly of the 21st century: his moves are a mixture of tap, ballet, gymnastics and, at times, football manoeuvres!  The scenes of tap dancing virtuosity across the lavatories, steps and railings of the brick back yards and along the streets and shed rooftops of Durham are as breathtaking as one of Gene Kelly's jubilant performances.  Yet, with Billy Elliot, the aggression and awkwardness of the moves are emotionally justified: he is angry and is dancing from frustrated energy reserves. There is nothing staged about his dancing, or indeed any part of this film, for it is enthused throughout by the thwarted passion and stifled, if ultimately triumphant, genius of the hero's dream.",Billy Elliot
167,Whiskey-Jack,Superb,10,17 September 2019,"I won't bother with a synopsis. The story line has been well explained.The final scene alone is worth the price of admission. The hauntingly beautiful score and the sheer, emotional impact of Billy's triumphant leap is almost unbearable.",Billy Elliot
168,Roemer,The dancing makes up for a lot,5,11 April 2001,"I can't believe so many people fall for the cheap, sentimental effects that are used in this film. Imagine how the script was written. ""OK, how are we going to raise some sympathy for this kid."" ""why, do we need to raise sympathy?"" ""For chrissake, he's a BALLET DANCER"". ""OK, what will we do, usual stuff?"" ""Yeah, dead mother, poor family"" ""Mines closing down?"" ""Hasn't that been done too often?"" ""Who cares?"" ""You're right. And let's put a demented grandma in there."" ""Good, good. Make sure the boy has to take care for her constantly."" ""We can't, he has to dance constantly."" ""The audience won't notice."" ""By the way, has anyone seen the ambition-blocked-by-parents-template anywhere?"" ""Yeah, I threw it out, it was worn-out too much. It must be somewhere here in the trash... here it is."" ""Thanks.""However, the script being written with a sledgehammer, the boy's dancing is brilliant, the girl is cute and the acting is quite nice.The funny thing is that I saw the Japanese film Shall we dansu? (dansu dance in Japanese) (http://us.imdb.com/Details?0117615) the day after on video. It's actually almost the same story, only the straightforward, poor, miners' boy is a shy, reasonable successful, Japanese businessman and it's not about ballet, but about ballroom dancing. I don't give a damn about ballroom, nor about shy Japanese businessmen, and I do like modern ballet, and England, however, the story of Shall we dansu? wins in originality, subtlety, humor and plain enjoyment. Although this gem of a film is older, it seemed to me the writers had seen ""Billy Elliot"" and declared: We can do this thing as well - but good. They actually knew all about the dance and gave their knowledge brilliant uses in the plot. You can't say that of Billy Elliot.",Billy Elliot
169,marchrijo,"Boxing and Ballet, Thatcher and Blair",8,29 December 2000,"Of the recent-years-""coal and music""-films (Brassed Off, The Full Monty), this is probably the best, and that's because of the acting and the human warmth in characterization. Jamie Bell (look at his reactions reading the letter from the Royal Ballet School, for instance!) gives one of the best performances I've ever seen by a child of this age. More than the other movies it tells the story of strong, ""emotionless"" people, who ""find themselves"" by losing their identities as miners and workers, by searching for a last exit from their helplessness and sadness. The career of Billy Elliot is born from despair. This is the key to understand the political and historical implications of the movie. It produces an integrative patriotic myth of the nation, by bringing together opposite cultures: coal and castles, workers and middle-class (Julie Walters!) strike and strikebreaker, boxing and ballet, not at least old sexual standards and new sexual frankness (Michael!). In a way, ""Billy Elliot"" neutralizes the great divide in british society: the sportive elegance of the ballet reflects the pragmatic flexibility of the Tony Blair England, which reconciles the Tories with labour, and the miners with the Thatcher tradition. In the very end, everybody comes together in a big national theatre and smiles at each other. Are the people just spectators of a political play, or do they form a national discussion group? It depends on death or survival of the ""swan"" Tony Blair!",Billy Elliot
170,dmnkeen,Powerful character study dressed up as a feel-good movie,10,9 October 2000,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILER!!!The most amazing thing about this film is to be found in what is not said. The unspoken motivation of Julie Walters' dance teacher and the spiteful silence of her young daughter towards Billy; the lack of initial emotional connection between Billy and his father (and the father's own reasons for pushing Billy into boxing); and the confrontation between father and son where not a word is spoken but where the father recognises for the first time the gift his son has. These are all extraordinarily powerful scenes in a movie which has been unfairly criticised in some quarters for wearing its heart on its sleeve and for inconsistencies in characterisation.I believe these criticisms are totally unfounded. Lee Hall's brilliant script and Stephen Daldry's inspired direction take basically Rocky-style material and overhaul it with terrific characters and truthful sentiment. Billy's dad does not act inconsistently when he is confronted by his son's talent - although times are hard, and he is on the face of it inattentive to his youngest child, he does finance his boxing lessons. Like the ballet teacher who sees her own missed opportunities in Billy, the father sees his own discarded potential in the ring in his son - the father's boxing prowess is referred to twice in the movie - and this clarifies even more his outrage when he discovers the hard-earned boxing money has been ""squandered"" on ""friggin' ballet"".There are many moments like this which underscore the characters' motivations in the film and critics who insist on inconsistencies really should pay more attention. This is one movie where we have to look deeper into background detail (which is sometimes placed discreetly before us) to get our answers as to why the people in this movie behave in the way they do. And that is a refreshing change from the characterisation-by-numbers tat which often disgraces modern movies.For these reasons above, I think ""Billy Elliot"" is not only one of the movies of the year, but one of the best for many years, especially from Britain where it seems crappy gangster movies are all filmmakers are interested in inflicting on us. Everything rings true in it and the acting is some of the best I have ever been privileged to see on screen.Julie Walters is, unsurprisingly, terrific as Billy's teacher; Jamie Draven is a revelation as Tony, the eldest brother; and everything that has been said of Jamie Bell as Billy is totally justified: this is the best performance by a young actor since Christian Bale in ""Empire of the Sun"".But, for me, the best performance (and the emotional core of the movie) is provided by Gary Lewis as the father. The pent-up rage which spills over into genuine grief and, finally, an act of unbridled desperation is all realised perfectly by this Scottish actor who, what with ""Carla's Song"", ""My Name Is Joe"", ""Orphans"", and now this, is fast becoming one of the most dynamic performers on the screen. If his name does not feature prominently come awards-time I will be sorely disappointed.Oh, and if all this sounds very serious, I should point out that the film is also incredibly funny, and ends with a smile fixed squarely on your face. Highly recommended.10/10",Billy Elliot
171,ericsinla,An old-time story for the year 2000 done right,9,20 July 2001,"The thing about this movie is that it's a small movie with an indepedent feel to it that has a Hollywood plot. It's a story you may have seen many times before in different ways.  But don't let it's Rocky overtones scare you away, Billy Elliot is still very original.  It touches you and it makes you laugh at the same time.  Jamie Bell gives a great performance as the lower middle class small town kid who wants to be a ballet dancer against his widowed fathers wishes.  The music for the film is also interesting, the director usesthe 1970's rock band ""T-Rex"" throughout the movie and even though it may not have been someone else's choice for a film set in the 1980's, the excellent ""Cosmic Dancer"" seems oddly appropriate. The films gender bending aspects are also very different from the standard Hollywood treatment hence ""The Full Monty"" comparison.

172,Siradakis,very good film,8,14 March 2007,"When ""Billy Elliot"" was first released in theaters, I consciously chose not to see it - I had a negative bias for no particular reason, really, even thought it was a very big hit. I guess I was tired of ""british suburbs"" films that make you depressed: I used to find them interesting but, then, after a certain point I felt they started becoming repetitive and ""dead ended"" like the lives they describe. So, when I practically bumped on the film in the TV, minute by minute I found myself being pleasantly surprised by what I was watching. Now, I believe it is one of my favorite films. What ""Billy Elliot"" manages to do is give a tender and tough, bitter and sweet, at the same time, taste of reality in the life of the boy. It makes a story with out the American- type ""emotionalism"", with the correct dosage of laughter, compassion and questioning for the viewer. The thin line between social criticizing is very well kept in the film, since it does not try to take a stand nor in politics (like Ken Loach would) or in other issues presented (such as homosexuality): it rather prefers to show the impact on the boys life, through his own eyes. In general very well directed and very well acted, music bonds very well with the action. Do not miss it.",Billy Elliot

I'm not usually one for the movies that leave you with the warm fuzzy feeling inside... but I most definatley loved this movie.One thing must be understood from the very beginning: This movie is very very British. My parents had a hard time understanding the speech at times, (which doesn't say much, but still,) and it's not just British accents... it's Durham accents. It's a kind of scottish/caulkney/british mix. Or something like that, lol.The cast is totally lovable, and they all portray very human charachters, flaws and all. The cinematography was absolutely stunning, and it made the movie very easy on the eyes.

In fact Billy's friend was there to show that Billy was not gay but that he accepted him for who he was. It showed that even the most intolerant of parents can be turned to support their child once they see how much it means to them and what talent they have, even in the worst situations. All the performances where great from the adults to the kids. Jamie Bell was a master a ""Billy"". I'm glad to see that he has become an A-list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles. He deserves it, his acting is golden. 10/10 all around for this move, which in my book is a timeless classic with a great message, and a must watch for anyone with an once of tolerance.",Billy Elliot
175,damittaja,A sweet sweet story not set in the colonies,9,14 April 2013,"One tends to heard about this movie now and then combined with praises but I watched it for the first time in 2013. I expected it to be good, but on the other hand the poster on its IMDb page is a bit turn off for me. When I saw in the intro credits that the movie is produced partly by BBC I got into a mixed state of feelings. My association with BBC is mainly to documents and news.Once the movie progressed I soon got to a sweet state of mind. The protagonist is so sympathetic with his big ears and bright nature. A perfect actor choice. The locale where the events unfold are also very serving. They convey at the same time a feeling of poorness mixed with hope and plain old good will to live.The characters react to Billy and his dancing hobby as one would expect them to react and a lot of funny moments play out due to this. I liked the music also - rock, punk and classical pieces mixed together.All in all, the movie is great. I was unconsciously trembling as I followed Billy's story unfolding. I would recommend this for anyone who asks. Also, the strong English accent and vocabulary rocks totally.",Billy Elliot
176,Laurie Mann,Very Enjoyable Movie,8,28 November 2000,"Jamie Bell and Gary Lewis were perfectly cast as son and father.  They looked amazingly alike, and when they argued it was almost as if the same person was arguing with himself.It was a joy to see Julie Walters, who just doesn't seem to do enough films, in this movie.  In some ways, she was playing the ""professor"" role from Educating Rita this time! We will be seeing more of her soon as she's been cast in the upcoming Harry Potter movie.I also have to agree with the other commenter who noted the ""R"" rating-it's almost purely for language, and probably a little for brawling.  This is the sort of movie that kids should see, preferably with their parents.",Billy Elliot
177,Mansilla,Overwhelmingly average.,5,17 January 2002,"This film left me wholly non-plussed. I came out of the cinema with very little positive or negative to say about it, and would have forgotten almost completely that I had even been to see it after a couple of months had it not been for the British Press, and for that matter the British Public, who had an almost rabid obsession with it. New British films are still calling themselves 'The new Billy Elliot!'. I couldn't believe my ears when I came out of the cinema. People were proclaiming it as the greatest film ever made, which it patently is not.I think the problem is that the plot is virtually non-existent. Artist struggles to get recognition. Thats been a cliche for a very long time now, so the film just played on sentimentality, and therefore ended up very sickly sweet and unsubtle, with all the messages rammed down your throat. Anyone can be a dancer, even if they are from a mining town! Not all dancers are gay! Prejudice is bad!To be fair, some of the acting is excellent, especially Julie Walters, who was magnificent as the Ballet Teacher who wasnt up to the job. Jamie Bell wasnt bad, but he overdoes it, although I suppose thats not terribly surprising for an actor in his early teens. The backdrop of the Miners Strike was handled in a surprisingly candid way. But I found it impossible to get even vaguely enthusiastic about this film. I thought it was overwhelmingly average. I find it absolutely bewildering that 'Billy Elliot' has got anywhere near the top 250. 5/10.",Billy Elliot
178,minnie_mie,One word sums it up: Brilliant,9,9 August 2001,"I was a bit late seeing Billy Elliot. It has been out for quite some time now, and I'd seen the trailers and read the synopsis and to be honest, despite all the rave reviews, it seemed like one of the dullest movies of the year. But when I finally watched it, I was left silent. I'm sure everyone knows the story by now. The performances from the cast were brilliant. No doubt about it, Jamie Bell as Billy the hopeful ballerina made an outstanding performance. Bell's facial and body expressions completely reflected how he felt. When he was angry, frustrated he let it all out in his sometimes manic dancing! Julie Walters gives a good portrayal of Billy's dancing teacher, and Gary Lewis creates a realistic relationship with Billy as his father. Jamie Draven as Tony, Billy's bad-tempered, 'hard man' brother gives an excellent performance that was totally underrated. Rarely was his name mentioned in reviews of Billy Elliot, even though he gave the film the realistic attitudes that a working class Northern English family would have. Now that I've watched Billy Elliot, I understand what all the fuss was about and promise never to judge a film until I have seen it for myself! Billy Elliot is now a firm favourite of mine. 10/10!",Billy Elliot
179,harunmushod,"Good film, but overhyped",6,9 April 2001,"Billy Elliot is a touching, funny story with great acting from Jamie Bell (Billy), Gary Lewis (Billy's dad) and Stuart Wells (Billy's friend who is just discovering his sexuality). Julie Walters as Billy's chainsmoking, swearing, ballet teacher is good too, but she is starting to get stereotyped in this type of role. Jamie Bell's dancing was excellent.
That said I don't think it was deserving of all the attention it got. It was a little formulaic and predictable. Ken Loach did this type of thing much better(and funnier)with ""Kes"".",Billy Elliot
180,Pzippity,Uplifting,10,27 December 2000,"Sorry for the pun, but this is one of the most uplifting movies I have seen for some time.  Jamie Bell is awesome in the title role.  His dancing is alone worth more than the admission price, and he's a gifted actor as well. His face is incredibly expressive.  You know just what he's feeling without him uttering a word.  The rest of the cast is equally excellent.  See this movie.  It may be the only one really worth seeing that has been released this dismal year!",Billy Elliot

It was on a rainy weekday and there were no more than half a dozen people in the theatre.When the credits rolled I turned to my mum and told her that I was too 'teared up' to leave immediately. She turned to me and said she felt the same.This is a beautifully uplifting film, made all the more poignant because we lived in the North East during this era and witnessed the conflict, the poverty and the prejudice which is so painstakingly portrayed alongside the main story.",Billy Elliot
183,sugarcookies-vita,The family is finally united with each other,10,11 September 2014,"This is the story about a boy who succeeds in making his dream come true under difficult conditions. The boy's father makes his son Billy go to a boxing school because he wants his son to be strong man. However, Billy saw the girls who learn ballet by chance. He always likes dancing with songs in his home more than hitting people such as boxing or wrestling. He decides to join the ballet lesson in secrecy and his ballet teacher recommends him to go to ballet school in London. When his father finds out that his son learning ballet, he becomes very angry. At the beginning of the film, the family's bond is weak and looks fragile, but gradually they are reunited with each other. The film made me laugh and touched me deeply. It has great characters and the memorable stories.",Billy Elliot
184,sethfan,More than just a feel-good movie,9,25 November 2000,"At first glance Billy Elliot might seem like just the latest feel-good drama...but it is so much more this time. On the surface it is about a family trapped by poverty in a small mining town. It is from this ""hell"" that Billy is able to ultimately escape, unlike his father, brother or nana.But looking deeper, this excellent film is about freedom of expression. Stephan Daldry marvelously juxtaposes Billy's ballet training against the fighting union members toward the scabs. It is about standing up for what you believe and expressing it in the only way you know how, which climaxes when Billy dances in front of his father in defiance...just as his father stands up against the scabs. I also thought they did a fine job of breaking down stereotypes. This is done through Billy's relationship with his friend Michael. The film makes it clear that a boy interested in dancing is not destined to be gay and that ""manly"" activities are nothing more than traditional and dead weight for people who fear change. In the end they all escape from the poor mining town: Billy literally; the rest of his family emotionally. I'm sure we will see more of Jamie Bell (Billy), not because of his well-done dancing but because of the energy and pathos he brings to the role. This one isn't just another feel-good movie; rather it speaks to us about where we should be headed as a society.",Billy Elliot
185,ogami-itto,Sentimental and cliched,1,20 July 2003,"British films seem to follow a set pattern of late. Or at least the ones that perform well outside of Britain. They either feature actors that couldn't even become stars on British t.v. pretending to be gangsters but coming across more as if they're starring in a bad episode of Minder (i.e. Guy Ritchie films) or they're heartwarming tales where the working classes find a talent to help them overcome their poverty (Full Monty) or they're kitchen sink dramas full of misery (any Mike Leigh film with the exception of Topsy Turvey). Billy Elliot ignores the Guy Ritchie route and instead seeks to combine aspects of Mike Leigh and The Full Monty. Here we're presented with a young working class lad who learns to dance in order to escape small town life. Trouble is Full Monty had jokes and Mike Leigh films have exceptional actors, here we get neither. Everything about Billy Elliot is cloying and manipulative, the scenes of the miners strikes add nothing to the movie and appear to be there just to add a weighty backdrop to the movie. In a film like Brassed Off the miners strike was used to deepen the emotional core of the movie, here it's just something that's there for a feeble tug at the heart strings. Everything about this film appears to have been lifted from a better movie. It's a shame that a talented actor such as Gary Lewis had to be involved with this nonsense. And it would have been nice if the lead actor had some talent whether it be for acting or dancing, Jamie Bell appears to have neither, he is the most annoying juvenile screen lead in a long time and hopping about like he has a crab in his underwear every ten minutes does not a dancer make. Sugary and insulting.",Billy Elliot
186,DeadDapperDan,Beautiful,8,24 March 2020,"Billy Elliot is one of the best British films I've watched. It's touching, amusing and uplifting. Film expresses the lead character's fight against his father and social prejudices to get an opportunity to pursue Ballet.What sets this movie apart from others is how it focuses more on the attitude of Billy, rather than the skill to achieve the his goals. Characters are well written and poignant social commentary makes the film even better.Stephen Daldry, one of the best in business, does a flawless job in directing the film.

187,craig.duncan,Left glad-hearted and amused,8,11 June 2001,"Thick accents - on occasion, I had to rewind, or ""translate from English"" for M - and cool 80s English pop/punk soundtrack, this movie at times seemed to be struggling to become a prepubescent Flashdance, a sort of wordless dance musical of one (except for one number with Julie Walters Billy's teacher). All the jumping and tapping to music couldn't fail to amuse and move the story along to as happy an ending as could be had without being trite and cliche, a bullet I was happily surprised to see dodged. Ultimately, I was left glad-hearted and amused, with one nagging question on my mind: is Billy, in fact, a Poof?",Billy Elliot

Unfortunately these films end up being full of cliches. There just isn't anything surprising in the story of Billy Elliot. Of course everybody is sursprised/angry by the choice of Billy to become a ballet dancer but then everybody rallies behind him for the feelgood ending.

193,vincentw,cute but sappy story of a working-class boy who prefers ballet to boxing.,6,13 November 2000,"Weird isn't it?  Miners from the North of England are all the rage in British films, not that all the mines have closed down. Billy Elliot takes us to the same milieu made popular in Brassed Off and The Full Monty; and the problematics of masculinity in a world where men are not working is again addressed.  This time we have an 11-year-old who discovers he prefers dancing to boxing, much to the dismay of his father and brother.
The film is cute and boasts a good performance by its star who has the young-old look of a kid who has known poverty.  It also has some beautiful industrial landscape shots.  Alas, however, like so many recent British films, it suffers from a sloppy, sappy script and a musical score which tugs relentlessly on the heart strings.  Given the premise, any of us could have written the script and we might have been able to resist some  of the excesses of sentiment.",Billy Elliot

Jamie Bell should no doubtedly been at least nominated for best actor in the oscars. His performance was one of the most passionate and realistic ones that I have ever seen come out of a boy his age. All of the acting was superb. The story made you laugh, it made you cry, and it inspires you to go out and live life. This will undoubtedly become a part of my movie collection and be watched numorous times. This is a movie that you can not go without seeing. A highly recommended film for which I give 10 out of 10.

His mother has been dead. And his dad and bro didn't allow him to do ballet and also said it was sissy thing.But he kept dancing. Sometime he couldn't be concentrating on. But he was just dancing and dancing like it's because of a fate. He said ""don't know"" when a professor asked him "" why are you doing ballet"" or something like that. But after that he started saying ""electric, there is fire in me"". YES, it's important to keep doing something. You can't do anything by forcing you to do it. You can keep doing something because YOU WANT TO DO THAT.I didn't know the history of that time of England. If I knew more I could understand more about how hard making a living is at that time.I love every scene.

196,chandos49,Jagged As A Chunk Of Coal: No Smooth Edges,5,27 July 2006,"Perhaps you're surprised to see me score this no more than 5 stars. I admit, I came to this film expecting to be wowed. I found it uneven in the extreme.The performances by Jamie Bell (Billy, the kid), Gary Lewis (Jackie, the Dad), and Julie Walters (dance instructor) in acting are very good, and Jamie's dance routine has all the verve and lack of polish one might hope to see in a novice dancer with raw talent.Raw, maybe that's it. The language was hardly what I'd wish to expose my children to, although I understand how a Brit swears better than most Yankees. It was appalling and ubiquitous. The soundtrack nearly drove me away. One must listen closely to the poorly miked dialogue, which is heavily inflected with the Lower Scots influence of the northern coalfields. Suddenly we're nearly blasted out of the room by pop tunes, as thumpy in their delivery as they are redundant in their lyrics.I found myself wondering why the screenplay didn't convey more of the attraction to Billy of the power and beauty of dance. I can think of half a dozen ways that might be accomplished. If I can do that, why not those responsible for producing/writing/directing it?Then there are the blithe bawdiness of ""Debbie,"" the repressed daughter of the dance teacher, and the confused and pitiful antics of ""Michael,"" ""Billy's"" buddy. These blur the focus of the narrative rather than sharpen it. If you haven't yet seen this, be prepared for some shining parts to an otherwise lowbrow approach to the lure and reward of the arts.",Billy Elliot

It is original, the depth of the storyline is superb, the intricacy of the plot is wonderful. Jamie Bell can never be more sure of a successful career. He truly is a wonderful dancer.One thing that cannot go without mention is the superb cinematography, headed by Brian Tufano. I was amazed by the versatility of the camera shots, which almost seems a crime seeing as how the acting was so good. Brian T's other credits include East Is East, Trainspotting and Quadrophenia, which I shall look into ASAP. I particularly admire Jamie Bell, Julie Walters, Jamie Draven and Gary Walters, the main characters. They fit together excellently, to form a wonderfully headed cast.Though there are far fewer UK films than American, they always seem to touch me in a way that many American ones do not.

It gave a very nice depiction of one boy's efforts to rise above the drudgery and pessimism of strike-torn life in the English coal mines.  It would have been very easy for the black side of the film to drag it down, but there is enough comic relief to balance this.Main criticisms - the storyline was a bit predictable, and some of the dialogue was almost incomprehensible.  Being a Kiwi I'm probably more used to English accents than most Americans, and I have lived in England for two years - but there were still some whole conversations where I couldn't catch a word!

It has been the fashion for year to portray the north of England as a hard done by hard nosed area. Well this is very boring and film makers should find another way of telling a story of this part of the country.The story of a young boy who want to do something that will be accepted in his world is a good one. but i feel that it could have been told better.

He not only has to overcome adversity in pursuit of his new ambitions, but he does so in the midst of his family's financial hardships. His father comes to terms with his son's interests and finds a way to just be a supportive dad to his son. The music and choreography in this movie go hand in hand with what Billy is going through.

208,jchandbab,The Latest 'Great British Movie' on the block,2,28 October 2000,"I have to admit that the main reason I went to see this movie was because of the many comparisons with 'the Full Monty' (which remains one of my favourite films).  Therefore, I went in with high hopes.  Unfortunately, what I got was not what I paid a fiver for.It starts off well, displaying the basic background of Billy, his family and the small northern England in which he lives. This is useful as it also illustrates early on that there is a mining strike on, which is the sub-plot to Billy's ambitions to dance.  What comes next is 90 minutes of some of the most formulaic cinema you are likely to see.  Every up and down and up again that Billy experiences is set in the template that the 'Full Monty' created- from the reaction to the 'initial' success, to the fall in morale when something goes wrong, to the fact that the comedy (mainly miffed and ironic facial expressions) is essentially the same, just that the adult cast of the 1997 film carry it better.Having criticised it so much, I would like to point out that 'Billy Elliot' is not a 'bad' film.  The acting (especially that of Julie Walters, the dance teacher) is pretty much flawless, while it is undeniable that the plight of the main character and its results are able to move the hardest of heart. The main problem is that these poignant moments don't occur often enough. The story of the strike involving Billy's father and brother turns out to be far more interesting in many ways, which is a shame, considering so much heart has obviously been put into this production, especially the choreography of the dance sequences, which are breathtaking. However, the final word must go to Steven Gately, who in his theme song 'I Believe', really sums up the whole experience: So, So predictable.",Billy Elliot

Funny in areas and also very tragic in the circumstances of the family of Billy Elliot. The performances are great throughout and the soundtrack is also excellent (always a bonus in a movie).

Jamie Bell leads as Elliot in this story of an aspiring dancer, and does so with integrity and brilliance.  By learning to dance for the difficult role, his performance was very believable and effective.  His Oscar snub still stuns me.  Julie Walters was stunning as the ballet teacher.

The woman honestly made it look like she wasn't acting.  However, I am a little perplexed why Gary Lewis was not nominated for best supporting acting for his role as Jackie Elliot, Billy's father.  I was moved to tears at the powerful range of emotion which this man portrayed throughout the movie.  In the scenes in which he led, he reigned supreme.  Yet, he was also generous in scenes led by others.  I don't remember seeing him before this movie, but I will certainly watch out for him in the future.Also wonderful was newcomer Jamie Bell who played the starring role.

I was reminded of the wonderful soundtrack, performances, directing, cinematography etc. After viewing it a number of times this week I went back to IMDb to research the cast and crew. I was then shocked to learn that the part of Jimmy in King Kong was Jamie Bell. I'm really happy to see his career is doing so well, and that he will be in the upcoming Flags of our Fathers with the equally talented Adam Beach. IMO it would be a shame to describe the film to someone who hasn't seen it. I recommend loading up on munchies, renting Billy Elliot, and sitting back some night with family or friends and having a thoroughly enjoyable evening!",Billy Elliot

Billy is eleven and practising boxing in his home town in northern England. In the same house a group of girls practise ballet. Billy gets interested of ballet and changes practice, not without complications and reactions from his family.All the actors are superb, not the least Billy himself (Jimmy Bell) My only remark is that I think the film is too short. 30 more minutes where we meet Billy aged 13-25 wouldn´t be wrong.

218,si_shaalini,It's an admirable movie.,6,4 December 2006,I was really moved by this movie.The relationship between Father and Son and the anxiety the family faces.Billy Elliot played by Jamie Bell is remarkable in his role as the defiant young lad who takes to Ballet instead of boxing.The nature of friendship portrayed between Billy and his school friend is also applaudable.The humour in the movie is really good and I was laughing more for this movie than for any other slapstick comedy.The character of Billy Elliot is truly inspirational since he has the courage to stand up to his father and pursue his dream. The scenes where each member of the family go berserk at each other is so adorable.It's a pity that the movie 'Anger Management' did not release in 1984.,Billy Elliot
219,matrixchic007,Excellent!,10,29 December 2002,"So my friend walks up to me and says, ""Why don't you watch Billy Elliot?"" Well, the idea of watching a flick with some little kid who does ballet doesn't strike me as the best thing to waste my day on. I was just as wrong as ever. Jamie Bell, though only appearing in a few movies, is a magnificent actor, and quite an incredible choice for his role as Billy. Billy Elliot is witty, dramatic, and quite striking, just as it should be. It quite rightly shows an eleven-year-old boy's struggle to make his dream come true. Also, Julie Walters portrays the rather sarcastic ballet teacher with perfection. To give a rough outline of the movie:Billy Elliot (Bell) comes from a rather low-class mining family, and is expected, as his father and brother before him, to accept his mining position with gratitude. However, one day after boxing lessons, he discovers his own passion: ballet. With the help of his new ballet teacher (Walters), Billy chases his dream of becoming a professional dancer.Now that you've heard my rant on this excellent movie, do you think you'll watch it? My dare to you is to always try to achieve your dreams...be like Billy...never give up.This movie sends out quite an important message, doesn't it?Matrixchic007 rates Billy Elliot as a 10 out of 10.",Billy Elliot
220,greigroselli,A story of a boy.,10,26 January 2001,"There is something about a boy's story as depicted in film.  It evokes our own coming of age, a cathartic moment sometimes that brings us to tears -- to see on film the events that oftentimes have touched our own lives, though I am sure few of us have found ourselves in the same situation as Billy, he still touches us -- because many of us have lost a parent, lived in confining conditions and have had dreams.  Many of us have had touching friendships and demanding, but loving teachers.  That is the power of Billy Elliot -- the story of one boy can surface our own memories, bring a tear as well.  Maybe that is why when I went to see the film me, and my friends were all crying by the closing credits!  I fell in love with Billy and his story.   The innocence of a child with a vision was best seen by this reviewer in Cinema Paradiso (I during that film too!).  In Billy Elliot, the power of a child with a passion, with electrical desire to dance despite his situation as a poor boy living in the mining town of Durham, England is wrenchingly powerful.  Together with totally mesmerizing acting jobs and magical and an upbeat soundtrack the movie takes you away from wherever you are and places you right in the life of Billy Elliot.  I laud Stephen Daltry, Lee Hall Jamie Bell and the whole crew for their superb job in film craftsmanship. It is a film to touch and soften the sourest and brittlest of hearts.",Billy Elliot

I have read many reviews complaining that this story has been done before. But the one thing that makes it different this time around is the fact that everything about it is perfect and overly delightful. Flashdance this is not! I have never laughed, cried, and cheered at the same time while watching a movie. One would have to have an icy and cynical demeanor not to love this film. And at the center of it all is a talented little Jamie Bell. He carries the film on his narrow shoulders as he literally dances his way to stardom. I hope he moves on to bigger things. Hopefully, he'll get an Oscar nomination for his brilliant portrayal of a kid who's just gotta dance. The rest of the cast is splendid as well, especially Julie Walters, who practically stole every scene she was in. Billy Elliot is a truly wonderful film. I'm seriously considering seeing it again and I recommend it to everyone who wants to cozy up to a great fairy tale with a beautiful ending. I give it five stars and beyond...",Billy Elliot

I rented the DVD (because of the IMBD note) and immediately purchased a copy - that was about a month ago.  I don't know how many times I have watched it, I've lost count - I just love it.  It has wonderful performances, good music, funny and serious scenes - I just can't say enough.  Rated ""R"" for the language alone (OK, blue-collar families in Britain say the ""F"" word a lot) - perhaps you don't want your youngest children seeing it, but otherwise put on your ""F""-word filter and see this movie!

That's what the movie is about -- being yourself regardless of who anyone else thinks you should be, should not be, or wants you to be.  For a good portion of the film, there is only one character that wants Billy to be himself (besides the late mother) and she reveals this early by saying ""Please yourself, darlin'.""The movie is full of people that want Billy to be someone other than himself -- even his childhood best friend who thinks that the dancing is OK wants him to be someone he is not.In the end (13 years after the main portion of the film) Billy is true to himself.

The story is classic Eagle comic stuff, the Ending predictabe.  But it's all saved from being pure marshmallow by superb direction and acting - never a false note: by deliberate under-playing of the more schmalzy moments: by beautiful camera-work:  and above all by the continual linkage to a particularly painful socio-economic episode in recent English history (Mrs Thatcher's brutal crushing of the miners' strike). So - almost full marks: but one mark has to be deducted for the final (""Ten Years Later"") sequence, terribly misjudged, superfluous, and containing a wretched stereotype out of kilter with all that's gone before.

228,jeffagso2369,"GO, BILLY! (mild spoilers)",10,19 July 2001,"I love this movie.  I saw it multiple times in the theater, and I bought the DVD the day it came out.This film works in so many ways.  Jamie Bell is perfectly cast as Billy, and I dare to say his performance in this film was every bit as good as Haley Joel Osment's in The Sixth Sense.  There were times watching this movie that I forgot he was an actor; I felt like he *was* Billy.  The film captures a place (1984) and an era (Thatcher's England) so well it's like time travel.The story is simple, and that's why it works.  The soundtrack is stunning, 100% bang-on, especially The Clash's ""London Calling"" and The Jam's ""Town Called Malice.""  Bell's dance numbers are brash and enthusiastic, and you can almost feel the character of Billy throwing everything he has into his self-expression.  The times that he seems most alive are when he is dancing, because it is then that he transcends the constraints placed upon him by his family and friends, and of course society, with its ""only poofs [homosexuals] dance"" mentality.  And hooray for Billy, the fact that his best friend is a cross-dressing ""poof"" doesn't really phase him.  The scene where Billy bids goodbye to Michael and Durham County is quite the heartstring tugger.If you haven't seen this movie, do so.  You'll want to dance right along with Billy, and don't be surprised if you find yourself, like Mrs. Wilkinson, cheering ""Go, Billy!""",Billy Elliot

232,ken kanazawa,Very cinematic. Often fantastic.,9,9 October 2000,"Here comes another charming film set in Northern England. Its dynamism almost sticking out of the screen, ""Billy Elliot"" reminded me that movies were once called ""motion picture"".Julie Walters and Gary Lewis offer superb supporting performances as a somewhat brusque dance teacher and a curmudgeonly miner respectively, but the biggest accolade should be received by Jamie Bell, whose natural acting as well as elastic dancing really struck me.Billy expresses pulses of his spirit - anger, sadness, pleasure and rupture - by dances rather than words. The more skillful he becomes in dancing, the more eloquently he does this, which at some time energetically collides with still lives such as concrete road and brick wall. The scene where Billy shows how much he loves ballet by dancing in front of his static father is just great.Some have justifiably criticised the superficiality of the secondary subjects like Billy's sexual orientation and miner's strike. My impression is that, as for whether Billy is straight or gay, the director has sensitively dealt with his vacillating and indecisive mind of coming of age. With respect to the miner's strike, had the film been given too much emphasis on it and been depressingly politicised as was ""Brassed Off"", it would have gone into a wrong direction, marginalising the main theme, i.e. Billy's growth.  Yet ""Billy Elliot"" has some defects. While it possesses a lot of fine moments when picture and music are so beautifully integrated into cinematic quality (I particularly like the take where the image of rather nettled Billy brandishing long and chunky stick overlaps with Fred Astaire's ""Top Hat""), there are also scenes so hackneyed that I almost sniggered, and the generally good music is sometimes obtrusive and over-sentimental. And if the redundant scenes had been cut and the script had allowed time for portlaying Billy boarding in London - where his character would necessarily crash with the value of the predominantly middle-class ballet institution - it might have possibly been more intriguing (but, alas, I realised it would take another film!).Having said these flaws, I believe ""Billy Elliot"" is one of the most fantastic works done by the British film industry. Yes, as most people admit, the story line is conventional to say the least, but that's not the whole point. The quality images and the splendid performances certainly compensate for the lack of originality in the plot. Above all, ""Billy Elliot"" successfully depicts explosive and jubilant nature of adolescence, and should receive massive applause from the audiences of any generation.Highly Recommended.",Billy Elliot
233,kelly-58,This is a heart-tugger.....,10,24 October 2000,"Maybe it was my unfulfilled desire to be a dancer, or the fine acting of this young boy, or the passion with which this movie seems to have been made.   This movie grabbed me and held on.  I have felt his frustration - wanting to dance and not being able.  I have felt his confusion - know you HAVE to dance, but not really knowing WHY.  Billy Elliott also brings in so much of other parts of life.  It touches on the subjects of poverty, sexuality, death of a loved one, father/son relationships, age, labor disputes.  Sound like a lot to cover?  Well, it's all one big picture here that meshes together perfectly.  SEE THIS MOVIE.",Billy Elliot
234,olajuwon,"Excellent, but seemed somewhat superficial",7,4 September 2000,"Billy Elliot would have been a great movie, if only its enthusiasm, which was so integral to the dance and storyline, hadn't been its downfall in dealing with inter-character relationships. The movie presented the dance scenes well and with fervor, and the English countryside backdrop was spectacular. As well, the language and British slang used, although hard to understand at times, was perfect for the characters and the movie.However, the movie was too enthusiastic in trying to do ""good"" in the end, and was slightly too formulaic. From the moment Billy made his speech about dance being a ""fire in his heart"" and like ""electricity"", the audience could easily tell the rest of the movie.In the director and screenwriter's enthusiasm to make a majority of the scenes (especially the dance ones) excellent, they ran by major points too quickly, and the movie seemed somewhat superficial. By trying to do too much, the movie accomplished little in terms of depth: Billy's relationship with his homosexual friend; Billy's thought process as to whether he himself was homosexual; his relationship with the dance teacher's daughter; Billy's deceased mother and her effect on the family; and the coal miner's strike, all things that contributed to the family's plight, could have been delved into in additional detail. These could all have been examined more in order to show us something about the personalities and actions of Billy and the other characters. By merely glossing over them, the movie tried to stay away from the serious and give audiences only happy endings, in the style of a more family-oriented movie (despite this movie's R rating). The movie also tended to drag at points.Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, due to its enthusiasm. Some of the scenes were light, and very humourous. However, the movie was able to use dark moods and anger effectively when the need arose.
Some relationships, such as the one between Billy and his father and Billy and his teacher, were explored in more depth with excellent results. The grandmother was a great character, used to show the family's plight as well as the caring aspects of Billy's personality. Billy's father was an excellent actor, and a perfect foil to Billy. The enthusiasm the actors showed for their roles is rarely matched. It was almost as if Jamie Bell ""became"" Billy, which is especially difficult for child actors to do.Even though I personally am not all that enamored with dance, this movie's dance scenes were well placed, well performed, and definately furthered the story.A solid, if not spectacular, movie, and definitely worth the money to go see it. If nothing else, you'll learn a few pieces of British slang.7/10",Billy Elliot
235,nkdnatl,A joyful surprise!,10,11 November 2000,"What a movie!  I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I went to see this British import. I had seen trailers and it looked endearing but I didn't really want to see schmaltz.  I am so glad I did see it.  First of all, the story was very uplifting.  Taking place in bleak Northern England during the coalminers' strike in the early 80s, watching Billy made me feel as if I squandered my early childhood on having fun and not developing myself - losing myself to a passion.  I know that sound VERY cheesy, but it's true. Jamie Bell's acting was excellent...his expressions of internal turmoil and triumph read easily through his face.  The performances Jamie Draven as his tough, pro-union brother and Stuart Wells, as his gay best friend are also very telling.I know I haven't done this film justice...I told my roommate it was The Cider House Rules of 2000 (I actually liked it better - more interesting struggle that strikes close to home and is more believeable).See this movie...I doubt you'll regret it...and, who knows?  You could leave the theater tapping your toes!",Billy Elliot
236,yorkmike,Great move but can be difficult for us Americans to understand at times,8,11 November 2000,"This was a very good movie overall. The only thing that detracted from it was I missed some of the dialog because I couldn't understand it.  Other than that it was an excellent movie.  There were a few times when I asked my wife ""what did he say"".  I would have enjoyed the film more if it weren't for this.",Billy Elliot
237,pumpkinland2000,A nearly flawless drama,9,18 November 2000,"This is one of those really great dramas that only come around maybe once a year. This is my pick for the best drama of 2000. Filled with amazing characters, a great plot, and circumstances that seem too real, the wonderfully underplayed value of it takes precedence over anything set against it.There are some great performances here, so let's get to em.Jamie Bell plays the lead role, in an astonishing performance. Amazing dance routines done in perfect sync, I can just imagine the time he had memorizing all the steps. A knockout performance, with some of the most dramatic scenes played out with perfect honesty and realism.Another notable performance comes from Julie Walters, who plays Mrs. Wilkinson, the dance instructor in the mining town where Billy lives. Once a great dancer but now forced to work in the bottom floor of a boxing hall, she plays her part wonderfully, showing the lack of compassion and jadedness without words but only through expressions, deep hurt lying beneath all that scorn, but love shining through as she sees Billy's true talent.
Finally, performance wise, we have Gary Lewis, who plays Billy's father. With wonderful scenes that play themselves out with harsh reality, I never tire of seeing the hurt in his eyes when he sees that his little boy isn't going to be a boxer or a football player, but a dancer, then seeing him again with the love and appreciation for his dancing son. Some things must be experienced, and the deep hurt he carries about the death of his wife is one of those. Greatness all around.The one problem I did have with this movie is that it is first of all rated R. Why?!  If it weren't for the few (and very effective) uses of the 'F' word, it would've gotten a PG-13 rating. It so strongly needs the 'F' word, yet it needs to be seen by a PG-13 audience! This is a move that truly should be shown to middle schoolers all over the country, showing that you should believe in yourself and no one else. Follow your dreams. Not only is this message not shoved down your throat (as some other movies shamelessly do), but it is done in such a way that you truly believe it. You want good things to happen, and you get that, but not spotless and clean. Nothing is done easily, and there will always be someone who will try and stop your dreams from coming true.Another (and the only other problem) are the accents. The British definitely have a style of speaking all their own, and it sometimes took a moment for all the dialogue to register. Sometimes I'd miss half a scene, trying to decipher out exactly what was said. However, the tones and emotions of most scenes were enough to let you know what was said. Everything didn't have to be spelt out, but I can imagine that after I get this DVD I will sit down with the captions on, just to know I didn't miss anything. This is one of the only complaints I have for another favorite of mine, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.Billy Elliot is a true rag-to-riches story that unfolds amazingly well without pulling your heartstrings shamelessly as other movies love to do. I recommend this to all, expect to be entertained with great plot twists as well as interesting characters, wonderful dialogue, and a story that can never grow old: Follow your dreams.",Billy Elliot

240,Mr. Hand-6,Good,8,16 December 2000,"A movie with characters and a story that you can imagine to be real. To begin with the bad, the story is a bit simple at some points. I find it difficult to express what I mean because English is not my native language. Cliché would be to harsh a word. Perhaps an example: When a certain ballet was to appear in the plot, did it have to be most famous off all times, Swan Lake?But overall I liked the movie so much that I tend to think this is perhaps just the amount of simplification or even cliché you have to do in a movie. Maybe it is difficult to capture more of real life in a movie without getting to complicated or boring.I liked very much the way the characters appeared like real people. They aren't rich, they have problems that remain unsolved, they even dare to look ugly on the screen. Watch the way young Billy's dancing looks clumsy most times, though the whole movie is about his talent to become a dancer. But this is just what you would expect in an eleven years old boy. It looks true. I felt the same about several other British movies of the recent years, for example Trainspotting or The Full Monty. I like that style. It is a pleasant contrast to the endless stream of Hollywood productions where every one looks as if he or she had just stepped out of a fashion advertisement.Though I have complained above about weaknesses of the story, it has still well enough interesting parts. Watch the way Billy reacts to the homosexual feelings that his friend Michael has towards him. I think the acting of both boys is quiet good.To me it was a touching movie, particularly the way Billy's father and brother respect Billy's wishes although at first they seem to treat him rough. I admit the ending brought some tears into my eyes. An 8 and a movie I would like to see again.",Billy Elliot

Folks, if you can't stand some straight-forward messages, then don't bother watching movies at all.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy a feel-good movie with realistic characters, then Billy Elliot is the one for you.  The final sequence of the film is spectacular.  Someone else mentioned that they couldn't understand how an 11-year-old boy could have angst.  Hey, try losing your mother (who sounds like one of the few people who understood Billy) at age 10 or 11 while your father and brother are distant and unsympathetic--and then see if you might not have a little angst, too!

Does anyone know the name of the beautiful piano music played when Billy is dancing in the boxing ring and Julie Walters is sitting facing him on a chair? I'd love to know. I agree with comments written about how difficult it can be to grasp the dialog. I grew up in Northern UK and my grandma was a Geordie (from Newcastle) but even so there are sections that are hard to decipher. For me the most moving is Billy's Dad and brother taking him to the bus station after he has been accepted by the National Ballet school. Also the way his grandma hugs him and then pushes him away as he is leaving.,Billy Elliot

What could be great about an 11 year-old boy from straight British coal miners background who dreams of becoming the new Fred Astaire? But finally the DVD made its way to the player and I must confess I was electricised. The intensity of the acting as well as that of the pictures, the discrepancy between the lost coal miners hopes and the subtle positivism ingrained in the stubborn boy, the subtle humor, all lack of arrogance .... it just all matched.

Definitely goes happy sad up down. But never could stop watching it till end 1hr 40min. It just kept me occupied. The characters are simple but has unique details.

249,ronocoolo,"A memorable movie, but not in the right way",5,2 November 2018,"While I did find the overall atmosphere of the town very enticing, the main plot of Billy Elliot didn't quite sit well with me. Billy's expression of emotions was very uncomfortable to witness, and the interactions didn't deliver the emotions or reactions from me that the movie intended. I actually believe if the movie was based on the town rather than Billy, I would have found it much more interesting, as the tension and developments within the workers strike could well have been a movie on it's own.",Billy Elliot

251,rosie-54,Billy represents the struggle we all have to fulfill our dreams,10,6 December 2000,"We all have struggled one time or another to fulfill our dreams.  Billy represents this struggle in us.  This is such a wonderful, down to earth, yet inspirational film.  It is so real.  As a teacher, not of ballet, but of mathematics, I have actually dealt with parents who did not want their daughters to be TOO academically inclined.  The same thing happens in reverse with Billy.  He is torn between pleasing or hating his family because of his wish to dance and their distaste and repugnance for this desire in a boy.  Every actor in this film plays his/her role to perfection. I absolutely did not want the movie to end!  But then came the most beautiful ending that I was satisfied with it.My advice: go see this film and you will come away uplifted!",Billy Elliot
252,dan-435,Don't be put off by the subject matter.,10,23 April 2001,"I have to say that I approached this film with some trepidation. The subject matter hardly filled me with enthusiasm - a young boy's quest against the odds to become a ballet dancer.What I got was a film which has given me some of the most memorable images from any film I've seen. Like the incredible dance sequence to T-Rex's ""I Love to Boogie"", with a startling display of footwork from Jamie Bell and Julie Walters.Or the magnificently understated scene where Billy receives the letter from the Royal Ballet telling him whether or not he has been accepted for a scholarship. It was a moment that had me literally bursting into tears of emotion, so utterly, utterly convincing was it.And the farewell scene at the Bus Station, with Jamie's Dad awkwardly hugging the gangling youngster. Sheer class.Julie Walters gives a performance thoroughly deserving of her Oscar nomination, and Jamie Bell is a revelation. His performance was recognised at home with a BAFTA award for Best Actor, and it is a performance every bit as memorable as Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense. Dare I be so bold as to suggest that if young Jamie were an American, Russell Crowe would not have had a Best Actor look-in?Magnificent film!",Billy Elliot

I think we don't expect much from the cinema any longer. Billy Eliot indeed is a very sweet young guy, but that's not enough. If that's all you are looking for, go to you local pre-school at lunch time.the movie reminds very much if not too much of the even worse movie - ""the Orchestra"". Hard working people in a difficult town, problems in the mines, difference between generation in the same family, father and son, collaborating with the enemy (the teacher - a rich person who's husband is from the mine management), love for art. the resemblance is too close.Not knowing how to write a decent dialoges, or to build a character, the director and screenwriter just uses the most usual and banal tools. no sophistication, nothing gentle, they put it all in a big spoon and shove it in your mouth. ""cry now"", ""feel touched now"" they tell you.why the teacher love the kid and helps him so much? I didn't understand until the end. he isn't really good, and he doesn't look very passionate about it. what is so good about him that he is considered such a talent? I don't know that either. I found the dance routines embarrassingly old and silly, you can almost imagine that lady from ""Fame"" making up the steps.so that's it. a waste of time and money. but I will be honest and admit that everyone else I talked to loved it.",Billy Elliot
255,archie-26,Best British movie of this year-which isn't saying much,10,13 November 2000,"The British Film Industry is in the doldrums at the moment and I for one am fed up with my local cinema filled with rip offs of ""Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels"". So it came as welcome relief that this film came along. Chiefly what makes this film work for me is that it is a British Film made for a British Audience - too often the British are portrayed as upper class twits or raving psychos and it's refreshing to see something different. It actually tries to be authentic and doesn't alter the dialogue or accents to suit the international market. The film isn't original, but lets face it with the exception of "" Being John Malkovich"" very few film are nowadays. What drives it are a clutch of fantastic performances that make you believe in the characters & want them to succeed. Complaints have been made against using the miners strike of the 1980's as a backdrop, but that's all it is, a backdrop - it's used and in my opinion very effectively, to further illustrate the struggle & sacrifices that Billy & his family must make in order that he can fulfil his dream and as for it being used as a setting too many times - when? the only other film I that I can think of is ""Brassed Off"" In short, a brilliant film that the British can be proud of, a rare commodity these days - let's just hope Mike Leigh is filming something....",Billy Elliot
256,robmillrs,Billy Elliot - The Class of 2000,10,10 December 2000,"To say that Billy Elliot is the best movie of 2000 is to damn it with faint praise, since this year's crop is pretty uninspiring. Better to compare it to movies of the past few years, and even then it would stand out. It is a phenomenally good film, and perhaps even groundbreaking in its own way, since it goes against the trend of quirky, violent, sex-obsessed moviemaking that's become so popular recently. We've finally been given a film with a good, almost mythic story, complicated yet believable characters, a masterful blend of emotional intensity and critical restraint, and a series of dance scenes that are authentic, inspiring and completely integral to the plot.No wonder critics have been falling over themselves in heaping praise on Billy Elliot. No wonder it's been holding its own in the box office despite being shown in a mere handful of theatres (one-quarter to one- sixth as many as the big Hollywood blockbusters) and despite its receiving hardly any promotion at the moment. Its success is being driven by word of mouth. And what is the word? Here is a movie that appeals to your heart, head, funny bone, eyes and ears, and last but not least your feet, for the music and the movement will have you wanting to get up and dance. And it achieves all of this without insulting the intelligence. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been done by Hollywood: Billy would have been made a more pathetic figure; the people in his life rendered more black and white; characters would have either remained caricatures, or made to develop in the blink of an eye. All such excesses are avoided in Billy Elliot, where the characters develop in a totally believable way, where Billy invites admiration instead of pity, and where the silences, looks and gestures all leave so much to the imagination. The dictum ""Less is more"" is clearly the guiding principle behind the film.The buzz for Billy has been so positive that people sometimes come away disappointed that their lives haven't been changed. So don't go expecting a ""knock 'em dead"" Hollywood rollercoaster. Billy Elliot is far more subtle, though the emotional moments are all the more powerful because of that. You can however believe everything that has been said of Jamie Bell. He has an outstanding screen presence and carries the movie on his little shoulders with breath-taking naturalism. His dancing is honest and powerful, and very masculine. He makes you forget that all the other actors give the performances of their careers in support.

The supporting cast were also spot on, well what would you expect from an actor of Julie Waters calibre?  Billy's father had such power and presence. Add to this a fantastic soundtrack and you have a film you'd be a fool to miss.I saw this on the same day as I saw the plain nasty and degrading affair that is 'The Cell'.

It has virtually all of the elements of what I expect in a fine film: great characters played with care by wonderful actors cast appropriately, a great director (in his first major effort), a moving plot set off by a number of very strong subplots, a striking new leading actor (and superb dancer) in the person of young Jamie, a gritty realism nicely moderated by fine touches of humor, and so much more.  But rather than say anything more about it, I strongly urge all film lovers to see ""Billy Elliot,"" and on the big screen if possible.

Billy Elliot is a magnificent slice of feel-good entertainment.With it's backdrop of the miner's strike of 1984, and the theme of triumph over adversity, this is bound to draw comparisons with Brassed Off and The Full Monty. However, this is a better film than both, and leaps and bounds ahead of the latter.Brilliantly judged performances all round, especially from Julie Walters and Gary Lewis (Billy's teacher and his father respectively) and new-boy Jamie Bell is a revelation. Add to that a fantastic soundtrack, understanding, unintrusive direction and some fantastic laugh out loud moments, and you have the first truly brilliant British film of the new millennium.",Billy Elliot
269,brook.jane,An uplifting film,9,28 September 2000,"The young boy in the title role of this film shares a similar history to the eponymous hero - a working class boy from a pit village who harbours a dream of becoming a ballet dancer. This shared background may have contributed to his completely natural performance.Anyone who has witnessed the psychological growing pains of young teenage boys will recognise and respond to the scenes where Billy struggles to express his feelings or shrugs off the clumsy attempts of adults to connect with his world.Unlike 'Brassed off', where the setting of the miners strike threatens to submerge the more personal dramas,the context serves to explain the struggles of the family without condoning, or patronising,the choices they make.The film plays on every emotion (I got through a lot of hankies) but never descends into mawkishness - though there were a couple of occasions when it teetered on the edge.Julie Walters is excellent as the ballet teacher but the finest performances come from Jamie Bell as Billy and Gary Lewis who is absolutely magnificent as the father whose whole raison d'etre is turned upside down.This film is likely to rank amongst the very finest of those heart warming 'Gritty Northern' films such as Kes and, of course, the Full Monty.",Billy Elliot

This is the kind of C-R-A-P that big Hollywood films are supposed to produce, not indies.  I feel like I need to take a shower.  There is a guy I'm not so fond of right now and I actually considered recommending the film to him just to ruin his day.  I couldn't. As much as I disliked this person I'm just not that spiteful.

I usually love small films like this, but there was so much hype in the media, that it just couldn't live up to it.  The earnest Billy and his desire to dance... and his macho father and brother are too easily convinced to stand behind his convictions. But set in the 80s mining strikes of England, the themes of working class vs. upper class, and following your dreams all did make the film very interesting, but just not as great as I'd been lead to believe.",Billy Elliot
272,Dave Curbow,"Bit cliched, but well worth watching",9,12 November 2000,"Other writers have noted that this film again visits the miners under pressure due to closing of coal mines -- settings used by Brassed Off and Full Monty, both films I enjoyed. The union strike in this film is more background than in those films.BTW: I don't see the setting as a problem. The mine closings, redundencies and subsequent homelessness produced a lot of turmoil in the British working class. It's hardly surprising that films critizing the Thatcher government are more common after her party is out of power since much of the financing for films seems to come from the government. I think there are still a few more films that could explore what happened to working people during this period.The film also reminded me of October Sky, where a young man's desire to excell in his field runs afoul of his father's expectation that he follow after him. The acting/dancing and photography/direction were excellent. This film is a tearjerker, but I didn't feel manipulated.I highly recommend this film -- although I wish they hadn't used such an unnecessary and negative stereotype in the final ""years later"" sequence.",Billy Elliot

You see his whole family as how he does, until a pivotal scene at the end of the film. I think the relationship Billy makes with the instructor is beautiful. parts of it have me laughing so hard i can't breathe. i love it :) Also, i find that it deals with the stereotypes most male dancers have to deal with. The fact that Billy is such a lovable character completely adds to the attraction of the movie. You start to worry about what will happen to this boy, you care about him.

279,dare31,There is a little boy (child) inside all of us,10,21 May 2001,"I watched this movie knowing little about it except that it was about a boy who challenged social stereotypes to take up dancing. I don't know what I expected, but I was not prepared for the marvel to which I was about to sit down. Without trying to give any of the movie away, there is little doubt that this movie has tons within it to appeal to the sentimental romantic. But it is not Forrest Gump. There is nothing improbable about this movie. It heralds brilliant performances by actors who have laid the hearts of their characters bare for all to view. There can be few dry eyes when the father is torn between his rigid ideals and the honest love he has to bring his son a future. To bears repeating again, however, there is no schlock to this moment.As a social commentary, this film ranks highly with Brassed Off, another political critique on Thatcherism and the cost it exacted of coal mining communities. Both films poignantly examine these costs by bringing the lesser known's, the miners and their families, to centre stage. Quirky they might seem, but life is full of quirkiness, especially if one has the courage to throw off the mantles of social constraints and conformity.It is hard to believe that Stephen Daldry is a first time screen director in this effort. But then, maybe it is not that surprising. Good theatre often makes its audience work and requires it to pay attention. The direction and allusions are often subtle but are hard to miss. We don't need to be told' that Billy's mother is dead by a character. Instead, we see the family interacting, and a couple of photographs, and we can deduce the rest. We are not told about the mining strike in as many words at the beginning, but the emergence of police tells us that we're in for a time of confrontation. Then we see the posters. We see the Billy's friend Debbie run her stick along wall (as children will do) and then across a battery of police shields  a darkly comic moment, but so telling of so many things including: the innocence of the children in a reeling world and the omnipresence of a police state in these small towns. In other words, we enter into' the screen and become almost ghostlike participants in the narrative, like Scrooge being led by the ghost of Christmas present. Perhaps that is why the emotions we feel are so powerful and so draining by the end. We have lived these characters' lives with them.The performances deserved much more recognition at the Oscars than it received. It is not surprising that Jamie Bell didn't receive a nomination for playing Billy, but he sure played a hell of a role. I guess the Academy can only reward so many first time performances but this is one that deserved mention. Jamie is Billy, or at least he comes across like he is  and that is great acting, regardless of the actor's age. Strong and memorable performances are also provided by Jamie Draven (brother Tony) and Julie Walters (dance teacher, Mrs Wilkinson). The performance Gary Lewis (Dad) is also well presented though I can't help feeling that the role was written powerfully regardless of the actor.Thus far, of the movies of 2000, I'd rank this only behind Crouching Tiger and in the company of The Contender and Wonder Boys. I easily gave the movie a 9-10 rating. A must see for all.",Billy Elliot

I especially enjoyed Billy`s dad - having lost his wife he is left alone with his sons and his mother, obviously not able to deal with his life, nevertheless always being the ""strong"" man of the family. And men do NOT go to ""bally"" lessons ! I would have given Billy Elliott a 8/10 if it wasn`t for the pathetic ending. #MAJOR SPOILERS# In my opinion, the film should have ended when Billy entered the bus, finally going to London to have dancing lessons. But somehow the director felt it was necessary to show Billys first stage performance (this is ten years later). Besides the fact that the older Billy is not resembling the younger Billy at all, the movie does not leave you with a fantasy about what could become of Billy or his family. Instead, you see his father and brother come to London (you wonder - where does all the money for this trip suddenly come from ? They wear good clothes etc.). The friend of his teen years who enjoyed wearing his mothers dresses and had a crush on Billy (wonderful performance !)  is now, 10 years later sitting next to Billys father, wearing a woman`s hat. Unfortunately, this scene does not keep in line with the subtle, intelligent storytelling we enjoyed throughout the film - but is a rather ""straight in your face - notice this guy is gay in 3 seconds before this movie is over"" scene. A few seconds less would have made Billy Elliott an almost perfect movie.",Billy Elliot
282,punne1,Crap,7,11 June 2001,"This film was totally boring to me, being as I'm not from Yorkshire or in my mid 40's.  Its the simple, non brain stimulating adventures of a boy discovering the world of ballet, with the obvious homophobic father.. ""I'm not having mah boy being no poofta!"". It's the depressing struggle of boring Northern suburban life and its been done before many times.. father loses job etc etc.  Quite frankly its crap and dull. The acting from the wannabe ballet dancer was average, though but next to the Sixth Sense kid its poop.  Julie Walters plays EXACTLY the same role as usual and I'm getting a little fed up of her now..""ooh I knowww"" I know she can act but variation is good every once and a while, isnt it?

But regardless it will touch your soul. Story is charming though rather predictable as one might correctly assume from a preview. Acting however is phenomenal, entire cast - from grandma to the youngest of dancers - did the most courageous job portraying emotionally and at times physically challenged characters. Spectacular Julie Walters, ballet teacher, seemingly unsophisticated bourgeoisie, plays with overwhelming mix of tremendous grace, coarse devotion and tasteful vulgarity; superb Gary Lewis, father of Billy, despite deeply disturbing and hence intricate character is never exceedingly dramatic but delightfully impetuous and affectionate; sensational Jamie Bell, brilliantly talanted boy with mesmerizing childish appeal, mature persuasive performance, striking sense of movement and most compelling ""dunno"" in all North England.Blend these characters with near catastrophic social and economic setting, groovy soundtrack and exceptional directing and you will end up with the hodgepodge of ""Shine"", ""Dancer in the Dark"", ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Ma vie en rose"", something you might not want to miss.",Billy Elliot

He portrays such a good character and if he kept dancing, I'm sure he could be a success. His best friend in the movie is gay (which you can totally tell from the moment he said that billy would look good in a tutu, plus him in a dress). I think Billy might have been a little upset about having to leave for ballet school, but maybe a little happy. He'd have to leave everything behind him that he ever knew and loved, because, like he said, he's never been to London. I wish he was a real person, Billy Madison. He seems like someone I'd totally love to get to know.",Billy Elliot
286,insight,"Great movie, great performance!",10,20 January 2003,"I have seen this twice. The first time I saw it, I had a rather negative angle to it, since I knew it'd be about ballet dancing. Since I'm no fan of such activities myself, I simply made up my mind that it would be bad. The second time I saw it (I was forced to do so by a teacher of mine), I didn't expect much. Since I already knew the story, and the outcome, I didn't pay much attention to it, then I realized what a brilliant acting it was in this movie. As well as how touching the story indeed is. Great directing as well. What struck me as very odd, was that I really appreciated Jamie Bells dancing. It's so full of energy and initiative that it's amazing. This is odd because I really don't have any idea what so ever about dancing, but I can still tell that this boy is good. He will go far!",Billy Elliot
287,tinskies03,Fab,10,17 September 2003,"Billy Elliot is a wonderful feel-good movie. It makes you realize what talent and hard work will get you (happiness).

290,mccon,It's Maggie's fault,1,4 July 2004,"One of a dismal series of films from the UK, all with the following plot: Due to the Evil Economic Policies of the Thatcher government, the {mine, mill, factory, farm, cheese shop -- choose one} is being closed, driving honest but dumb people into a life on the dole. Meanwhile, one or more characters have always wanted to be {a ballet dancer, a jazz musician, male strippers -- choose one}. One or more other characters initially resist this ambition, then are won over and perform an act of self-sacrifice. Years later, everyone feels better. In fact, this genre' could be called ""feel-better"" films, since you won't leave the theatre feeling good, but you may at least feel somewhat better.",Billy Elliot
291,Aced,Great film,9,5 September 2004,"First off, I enjoyed this film immensely. It never left me wanting or bored for a moment.Although a moderate story that has probably had many incarnations and forms, this film just gives it that little extra to be special. This is probably also due to the performances given by the entire cast, which were very good. I must say that I was especially impressed with the performance given by Jamie Bell in this film.The story and the characters evolve at a good pace. It makes you truly feel for all the characters, and the problems they're facing, and that, in my opinion, makes a movie worthwhile.4.5 out of 5",Billy Elliot
292,Linzola,Poignant,10,18 April 2005,"This movie is lovely because it cannot possibly be cornered into a genre. It is at once about a a family, a town, and a teacher, each isolated from the others but connected by this charming little boy and his gift. This movie has moments that glow dull with a sad stagnation, shine with hope, and radiate a sense of reality and unconditional love. It is so sensitively executed; the acting is naturalistic and while there's nothing gritty about this film, it's not sticky sweet either. If you enjoy dramas with ""happy"" or hopeful endings that aren't TOO Disney-ish(I'm thinking Good Will Hunting, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, the Shawshank Redemption, Sideways) this is worth watching. 10/10",Billy Elliot
293,cachemasterluke,Decent coming of age story,7,31 May 2016,"There were many positives of this movie, the biggest being Jamie Bell's performance. What a wonderful representation of a boy who isn't understood by his loved ones but supersedes this and goes on to success. Wonderful acting by all the main parts, especially Jamie who accomplished this very young.My biggest blight with this film is that I wish the side story with Billy and Michael was much greater. There was little intimacy between the two of them and I felt like at the end of the film it was still ambiguous as to what sexual orientation Billy held. Any bloke can get a quick kiss on the cheek but I felt these two never shared anything special enough in the film to warrant a romantic relationship between the two.",Billy Elliot
294,MikeSunami,The ending of the film....,9,3 February 2007,"On the last scene, we see Michael, aged 25. presuming this is 14 years later, from when we last saw Michael (when he was 11) the year should now be 1998. So how come we see Billy's dad looking much older, yet Billys brother, Tony, looks the same as he did 14 years before? This is obviously a minor error, but it still should have been taken into consideration. All films have some misdemeanours, and it is peoples jobs to point these out. After all, where would films be without the careful viewers? Billy Elliot is a powerful film full of emotions. Lets not ruin it with errors, shall we? Because i for one love this film. And i'm sure you do too",Billy Elliot

296,madzorg,"Great, inspirational movie",10,3 November 2000,"This movie wonderfully depicts how someone can rise up out of a bad situation and become someone by doing what they love.  Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) is excellent in the movie and not a bad dancer.  Everyone should go out and support quality filmmaking like this.  In a time when people complain there are no movies made that are heart-warming and ""family"" safe, along comes a movie like ""Billy Elliot"".I can't say enough about this film.  I would venture to say that this is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year.  I hope that this movie gets just as much attention as ""The Full Monty"" did when it was released in the US.",Billy Elliot
297,fabmarty-2,Absolutely Tremendous!,10,1 November 2000,"This film blew me away. Seeing the trailers, I thought this would be a bit of a soft, schmalzy chick-flick. What I got was a rollercoaster ride of a film. Funny, serious, inspirational, dark, grim, hopeful - in fact every emotion was felt throughout this film. The cinematography is superb and the acting is second-to-none. You can really feel the emotions of the characters in their strike-ridden tormented family life and Billy himself is worthy of an Oscar. Go see this now, truly a film for all seasons!",Billy Elliot
298,gmh-3,"It didn't totally meet my expectations, but it was worth seeing",8,24 April 2001,"The storyline worked for me although I was somewhat distracted by the less-than-stellar acting (except from Billy's dance instructor, who I thought did a great job). Nor could I accept the apparent change in relationships (father-son, brother-brother) that occurred near the end of the movie (could the settling of a bitter mining strike really re-engender such family love?). Also, I did not see the relevance of the minor homosexual sub-theme, which I felt was a distraction. But the soundtrack was good (well, the music was excellent - the northern English accent required some translation for me by my British-born wife). And I laughed a lot, sometimes almost to the point of tears, and that must be the ultimate test of a comedy.",Billy Elliot
299,Nimba,I love English acting,8,20 January 2001,"A lovely film leaving, at least me with an urge to dance. It's always a pleasure to see Julie Walters acting and the young boy acted very great and convincingly. But towards the end I found the movie a little bit too much playing on emotions. Though what a fantastic shot to end the movie with! I really would have liked to see some of the grown up Elliot and his dancing at his premier.",Billy Elliot

301,aerees,New British Classic,9,28 September 2000,"I went to see Billy Elliot last night. I had some free time and was offered tickets for an advanced preview. I went into the cinema with few hopes or expectations but I left with feelings of great astonishment.The film is not just another coming of age film like so many others in film history, but it sets the simple story of a boys hopes and desires against the backdrop of the 1984 miners strike.The director Stephen Daldry has produced an amazing film. Billys love affair with the ballet is starkly contrasted with rugged surroundings of the North Eastern Mining community.It wouldn't be right to finish this review without mentioning two key points of the film. First the soundtrack combines elegance of classic ballet music with a funky T rex soundtrack. The second point is the amazing performance of Julie Walters. It is not just with her physical presence as the undersexed, sharp tongued Mrs Wilkinson that Miss Walters fulfills this role but also with the emotional undercurrent that is so important here.A true British classic",Billy Elliot
302,hedderik,"A nice, sort of cute movie... but those ballet scenes!",7,25 June 2002,"(First of all, the next comments are not because I do not like ballet - I'm an ex-amateur-ballet-dancer) Don't go to see this movie if your main interest is ballet. Billy's dancing is good, but the footage of his lessons is definitely not in sync with how he dances. When he is already dancing the stars from the skies, the viewer still gets to see minutes and minutes of simple pirouette exercises... I needed to use the fast-forward button quite often. It's a shame that they didn't have a ballet-instructor more directly involved in the montage of the movie.",Billy Elliot
303,genrek,A must see movie,10,18 April 2001,"We watched this movie last night after renting it at the video store.  It had a great cast, a great story, and was very well done.

Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) is, in my eyes, the best new comer of the year 2000 and Julie Walters performance as ballet teacher is brilliant. Stephen Daldry did what other directors can't bring to the screen with millions of dollars, a master piece! This movie has so much charm and emotions. It makes you cry, laugh and it makes you believe that ""we can touch the sky and beyond if we only believe in it."" This movie and it's sound track will blow you",Billy Elliot

There isn't a single bit of it that doesn't feel true and that touches your soul. Billy and his family had me from the first scene to the last. There is a lot to be said about this movie and I could spend a couple of hours praising it, but I think You all should just go and see it for yourselves! If you watch movies because of the acting and if you wanna get to know the characters and love them, then you will like it I hope. If you want action, sex and glamour, then you might not. I was disappointed it didn't get more Oscar nods. Julie Walters was great and atleast Jamie Bell was awarded elsewhere (the British academy award, and the national board of review), but my personal favorites (amongst favorites) were Gary Lewis as the father and Jean Heywood as the grandmother.",Billy Elliot

In this movie I was led from smiling and laughing to feel the tears on my eyes. For nearly two hours I have forgot everything else and dived into this kid's life, felt his frustrations and happiness with him. It was a thrilling experience. Seldom does a movie set me into such an empathy with the characters. The acting is very good, Jamie Bell was just amazing.

The violence and poverty depicted as part of the story were very depressing for me.  Also, the dialects were so heavy and thick that I missed about 25% of the dialogue.

313,MDK-9,Watch it if you can.,7,28 September 2000,"Billy Elliot: Good or Bad?Having recently watched Billy Elliot , I thought I'd write a quick note about it.I must admit, initially I agreed with the general consensus, that a film about a ballerina (not to mention a male one) had the prospect of being about as exciting as watching paint dry, but putting this thought aside, I went into the cinema with an open mind.I'll start off by saying I'm glad I had the chance to see this film because otherwise I might have missed out on what was a compelling story. The `star to be' Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) put in the best child performance I've seen since Hayley Joel Osment (Sixth Sense), yes it was that good of a performance. This, matched up with a sturdy support cast and a solid performance from Julie Walters, made up for an unexpected (for me anyway) good film.The film also touches on the miners' strike as a `side track' story to Billys' ballerina exploits. This is done very well, leaving the viewer caring about both Billy and the mining community he lives in. Some of the scenes in the film are filled with such emotion that I defy even the sternest person not to be touched.So the answer to the question posed at the top. Yes Billy Elliot is a good film, but I feel that the females out there will gain more enjoyment than the average male due to its content.All in all though, Billy Elliot is an enjoyable film for all.",Billy Elliot
314,koen.heidbuchel,Marvellous Jamie Bell stars in his first role,10,9 February 2001,"It took a while before Billy Elliot reached our theatres, but if waiting is as rewarded as in this case, I always would like to wait for a film to revail its magic. As a Belgian, who has lost his heart in U.K. and who sometimes comes to search for it, I am a great fan of British film. After films like Brassed Off, Get Real, The Browning Version, The Full Monty, The Winslow Bow, The Winter Guest, Sense & Sensibility,... Billy Elliot is yet another film that gets me by the throat. As usually acting is like real life performances. If I'm allowed to compare Jamie Bell with Haley Joel Osment (Sixth Sense), who got a  deserved nomination for Academy Awards, I must admit that , according to my modest but true opinion, Jamie Bell should at least get the same admission. This boy gives Billy Elliot a real soul, a honest and realistic character. After several days , I'm still dazzled by this beautiful icon of cinema. Well done, Jamie, and I hope to see more of you in the future ! Koen.",Billy Elliot
315,dan.harris1,"Excellent, purely excellent",10,2 October 2000,"As I work at a cinema, I get to see most movies that open in the UK. With a few exceptions (Gladiator, Toy Story 2) the movies that have come out this year range from awful to mediocre. Billy Elliot is, however, fantastic. I did not know anything about the movie before it was released and did not know what to expect, and all I can say is that I now recommend this movie to everybody that comes through the door. The Dancer, Jamie Bell is magnificent in the title roll, and could easily carry the film on his own and he is supported by an excellent cast, including Julie Walters, in her best (albeit brief) performance in years.A truly superb, timeless masterpiece. See it now...!",Billy Elliot
316,sicole,"Pure magic, intensely delightful if a little superficial",10,20 December 2000,"I walked into the cinema not knowing what to expect and that really rewarded my viewing.  It was quite realistic - but also sweet and endearing.  It contrasted the harsh realities of the mining protests (with great cinematography) with this boys gentle love of ballet who is caught between his love of a ""poofy"" art with the harsh realities of redundancy in his own family.Jamie Bell's performance is truly unique and upon thought, mildly disturbing.  His role as Billy Elliot is slightly dysfunctional but also unbelievably intriguing.  Even though everyone has praised this movie and this actor way too much, he really deserves a shout when it gets to OSCAR time.  I'm not sure it will do the lad any good, but for his performance in the film alone, he should at least be nominated.I was taken back by the dance sequences which were pretty sensational. It was a light-hearted film but the dance scenes were intense and quite poignant at times. I was intrigued by his way of expressing his anger through dance - quite astonishing.Bad points - I still do not like how the film ended. Its too trite for my liking.  At one point, sentimental music spoiled a good moment in the film near the end when Billy starts dancing in front of his dad.  It would have been more surreal if they just left the music out of that scene entirely - I like surreal!All in all, this film is heart-warming yet foul-mouthed, delightful yet at times superficial - but most of all, its well worth a watch.",Billy Elliot
317,ennison-3,"Nice film, but I was not impressed.",6,23 April 2001,"A nice film, yes. But I was not impressed, because the film is only touching interesting subjects, not really leading you into them: the coal miners' strike, the family problems, Billy's possible first love for Debbie, Billy's possible homosexuality. It is typical for the film that he does not even dare to clearly express whether Billy is homosexual or not. And I was very surprised that Billy, after all those ballet lessons, started step dancing suddenly. It's a pity that you could not even see Billy dancing after his education in London: the film ends with his first jump.
I think Jamie Bell did not act exceptionally good. Looking at actors, I always see if I forget they are playing - with Jamie I never could. Compare with Dominique Swain as ""Lolita"", this is how good a young person can act in his/her first film!",Billy Elliot
318,earthxdog,"Dance, don't walk to Billy Elliot",10,12 October 2000,"There are times when the world of film delivers a genuine gem.  There are times when a story is told that can touch and move you to places that you either haven't been or needed to go without the tricks or traps of Hollywood manipulation.  ""Billy Elliot"" is that gem.  It is a slice of life with the beauty of youth, the strife of real life, the bond of family, the blessing of talent and the prize in a soaring spirit.  The title character is an 11-year-old boy (the amazing Jamie Bell) in a British mining town during the 1984 strikes.  His father and brother are part of the strike and he is left to watch his aging grandmother after school as the men spend the days at the picket line.  His only respite is the gym in the center of the village in which he takes his grandfather's boxing gloves and goes, mostly unsuccessfully into pee wee bouts.  One afternoon Mrs. Wilkinson's (Walters) ballet class moves into the gym to utilize space and help pay the rent. Drawn like a moth to a flame, the young boy slowly begins to work his way into the class.  The boys father (a wonderfully effective Gary Lewis) soon discovers that his son is not boxing and the traditional gender roles and masculine mining town mentality and ego are played to aplomb.  When he forbids Billy to dance, Mrs. Wilkinson trains him on the sly with the plan to take him to London to audition for the Royal Ballet School.  Eventually this is discovered as Billy misses his audition because his brother Tony (Jamie Draven) has been arrested during the strikes.  As time and the strike go on it is the scenes in which young Billy rebels against the stereotypical dancer as a poof by being exactly who he is.  One of the finest moments comes as he dances purposefully in front of and all around his bewildered father after having been caught training a friend in the gym one night. This is the turnaround and the father is shaken into realizing that Billy has promise.  What follows is the awakenings of fate, life, family and dreams.  A beautiful story with affecting performances and a lead that is so graceful and enchanting a dancer, this is a film that cannot and should not be missed.  Rated R for language, it would otherwise be the type of film that would rule come Oscar time.  I will be personally upset if it doesn't win that sort of recognition as it is the most deserved of the honor in years.(A++)",Billy Elliot

I really enjoyed this movie. I don't care that the story line was trite or that the ending was obvious, it made me feel good. I loved the characters, and I felt they grew in the film. They were complex and flawed but interesting. Even though you may have seen the plot before, it may be hackneyed or even cliched, the people in the film are real.
For me, this was, at least in part, a film about relationships. The dynamics of the family under pressure are beautifully portrayed. I empathised so much with the brother as he tries to say goodbye to Billy but can't be heard, and the father as he prepares to abandon his principles to give his son a chance. Those moments were simple realisations of the deep feelings that are too hard to express and were deeply moving (I nearly blubbed).But the film isn't all girly. Its funny, bloody hilarious in places. Its the way I remember being 11. (Except I would never dance. Never. Real men don't. Ever.)I would love to argue every negative point that other reviewers have made. Except one.

I'd like to recommend those sequences in which the father fights against his impulses, against the common thoughts, because this gives Billy the strength to keep on even knowing the family disintegration was consumed.

The backdrop -- the coal miners' strike -- isn't hidden away or whitewashed, but it isn't allowed to overshadow Billy's story, either. It merely... enhances it.Absolutely wonderful movie, highly reminiscent of another favorite of mine, ""Brassed off"". But I think Billy's story just might be a little bit stronger, more powerful.",Billy Elliot

It has shot me out of the theater seat directly next to this young fellow, trying to find his wings. Very strong story, funny moments and moving sentiments.

333,ncsastudent,Shall we dance?,10,3 February 2001,"In a world of Godzilla's and Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo's Billy Elliot was a breath of fresh air. Finally a successful movie that doesn't compromise itself. A film of art. It is like a water color painting of 1984 England with characters that are beautiful in their own imperfections (a characteristic of British films). Of course Billy Elliot isn't perfect there are few films that are. Billy Elliot's grand finale speech was a bit over done and Billy Elliot at the age of 25 looked nothing like Billy at the age of 11. But all in all this movie is a fabulous piece. If you loved Dead Poets Society, or Ordinary People this movie is truly for you. With marvelous direction and creative cinematic composition, a wonderful score, and acting, on the parts of Jamie Bell and Julie Walters, that is un-parallel with recent films, this movie just may dance away with an Oscar.",Billy Elliot
334,Indra,I wonder if any movie has been that moving?,10,14 February 2001,"Okay, I love to dance so I´m kind of prejudiced. But even though, I was so tremendously moved by this movie. I went out of the theatre and just thought:"" Wait a minute, I don´t want the movie to end, I want it to ontinue forever."" And then I cried just because it was so good. So that´s the way this movie moved me. I thought the actors were great, the story was great, I just would have liked to have a little bit more dancing in the end. But what did Billy say, when he dances he forgets everything and just feels ""electricity"", well that´s it about dancing. He said it and he is right!",Billy Elliot

The movie transported me to my childhood.to my dreams, and reminded me that everything is  possible if you really want to do it.  The movie explores all sorts of emotions of the real life,  the  social, economical  and political circumstances  as well as the family relationships  with their weakness and their strength.I loved the way the director photographed the scenes and the backgrounds, expressing the hardness and oppressiveness of the environment in contrast to the artistic liberation of Billy.We need more movies like this one,  which  make us think and  encourages to fight for what we want  no matter what the conditions are.

Whether you can relate to Billy as an artist, a friend, a supporter, or a fan. Splendid performances by Julie Walters, Jamie Bell, and Gary Lewis help to make this film a winner. It touched my heart and warmed my soul. It had me dancing to the music in no time.

It's one of those films that might be considered ""soul food"". I don't want to talk about all the acting stuff; my only intention is to set my feelings here, and I must be honest: I'm not the same since i watched it. Something has changed inside of me. I wouldn't be able to say exactly what, or how, but my soul has been shaken, and I can see things different, as if ""Billy Elliot"" had opened my eyes. It's very hard for me to put it in words, my intention is to show people that when things are made with all our hearts, they cannot be but rejoicing and delightful. And this film is the best proof of that, fulfilling all the possible expectations.

340,drasuten,great movie,10,17 November 2001,Yet another extraordinary example of Brittish moviemaking. As always it shows an ordinary family in the British society. The only bad thing about it is that it has a little Disney type ending. But fortunately it fits well in to the story. Another great thing about the movie is the superb soundtrack with mostly T Rex songs. A great tribute to T Rex,Billy Elliot
341,blackrock-1,Plane viewing,10,24 March 2001,"I saw this film on a transatlantic flight recently. I saw Flashdance on a plane journey back in 1984. I thought this would be the British version of that movie some 17 years later but set back in 1984 just to prompt my memory. Seemed like a piece of history repeating itself for me.I grew up in the north-east of England so I can relate to most of the scenery, accents etc. very well. Then came the unexpected bits. Firstly, Billy's grandmother suffering from dementure and wandering off...just as my mother used to do. And secondly, the scene that I'm still trying to cope with. Billy visiting his mother's grave. This grave was set in the same graveyard my parents are now interred. These are very hard things to cope with at 37,000 feet surrounded by lots of people at close proximity all of whom are strangers.And I suppose I was right in a way, it had some of Flashdance in it. But for different reasons to most I will always find this movie, most memorable.",Billy Elliot

Reading the back of the box will make you believe this is just one more cliche movie about a working-class son struggling to assert his dream to his coal mining father.  Tremendous performances by all the major actors give this film incredible power.  Billy Elliot is at once powerful and brilliantly lighthearted, handling its subject matter with just the right balance of humor and emotion.",Billy Elliot
343,vlucian,A beautiful original movie,8,10 September 2001,"""Billy Elliot"" is original, sensible, funny and refreshing. The story is simple and real, you don't find the typical hollywoodian sentimental charges that sometimes spoil all the fun. It's like taking a sip of real life: the sadness is there, all the time, not underlined or exploited, the joys are subtle and success means loosing something.Billy is great , acting or dancing; another character that really impressed me is his father, the prototype of the simple good-hearted man.On the whole, the movie is beautiful, refreshing, different, it has something special, I would call it: the European touch.",Billy Elliot

The minute before I got into the cinema I had no idea that my life would be changed for ever. This film was everything I needed to inspire me and to push me to do what I like artistically. 6 months later I moved to London, yes, because of the film. This film is magical, it doesn't have one single dull moment, every second of it has a message behind... every line has many lines in between. Jamie Bell, Julie Walters and Gary Lewis are absolutely  perfect in it! Stephen Daldry should have gotten the Oscar he was nominated for!This is, needless to say, my most favourite film.

348,sebajessica,"My opinion to the brilliant film ""Billy Elliot""",9,23 March 2007,"I watched this film during the last week in school. At first I thought that drama film could be very boring, but while I watched it, it became more and more interesting. I like to see Billy Elliot performing; he is very great at acting. He can dance, box and do ballet, he is multi talented in performing other characters I think. He played every scene very self-assured and serious.I also think that all the other actors gave 100 percent. Their clothes go very well with the time in which the film takes places. Besides I like the setting, it was very good arranged.In my opinion it is very interesting to watch a film like this. There are a lot of problems in the family, since the mother died. A lot of people want change him to an other person he isn't, but Billy is pursuing all the time his greatness wish, to dance and go to a ballet school. He is a very powerful person. To see how the dad change his opinion to his sons and to ballet was very exiting.The message of the film is that everyone is legitimate to follow and life their own wishes and dreams and no one have to be against that, because it isn't his or her live. So everybody should accept the opinion of the others.But I also have to criticize some aspects too. I don't like the background music so much; piano music isn't that what young people want to hear. The second aspect I have to criticize is the title of the film. The name ""Billy Elliot"" isn't so exiting. The film should have a more interesting title I think.But all in one I can recommend this film to everybody who hasn't watched Billy Elliot yet and want to do that. It's worth watching.",Billy Elliot
349,gutgemeinterrat,"Billy Elliot - ""A natural film""",5,23 March 2007,"Billy Elliot - ReviewThe movie Billy Elliot"" is about a boy whose dream is to become a great dancer. The title is the same as the name of the main character.I think the actor who plays ""Billy"" has played the role of him full of emotions. He and the actor of the father play their role seriously, too. And they show a realistic relationship between father and son and how they respect and love each other. The message of the film is at first that it is not impossible to realise your dream and that a family is very important in your life and that they have to support each other at any time in anything. So the music is also important, because it express emotions and feelings (""Ups and Downs"") in the movie as the same like the whole dancing scenes that shows how Billy feels in any situation at a moment. There are a lot of different camera movements in this movie; I think almost all of them.At the end the film was in my opinion in some parts boring and you don't really understand the context about the ""strike"" and about the relationship to his school-friend, who was in my view ""gay"". But it was very successful to show the problems and relationship in the family and between father and son. So I think this film is recommendable for people who like to watch ""family-dramas"" and movies about dancing.I give the film 3 of 5 stars.",Billy Elliot
350,kamilero-1,mas o menos,4,23 March 2007,"The Billy Elliot Review"" Billy Elliot"" is a movie about very young boy, who want become a ballet dancer. But at the beginning his father does not want this, because he want that Billy should become a good boxer.I think the movie was not so good, because the story was not ambitious. The characters are Irish. Billy and his father plays his role very seriously. They are very bullheaded. Could not understand the strike and where Billys mother is. I think she is dead. At the beginning the movie was good, but a story about person, whose dream is to become a ballet dancer, is not flavour. The movie was not so good, but the actors plays their parts good. The father shows the really relationship about son and father. Try to realize a dream and have a good relationship to his family. I think this is a message about the film. The music goes together with different scenes. It was good music. The movie has not any special effects. I miss the special effects, but the movie is a ""drama"" an d not a action film.The film was boring. I can not identify me with the film. I can recommend the film to person, who love dramatic films I give the movie 2 stars to of 5.",Billy Elliot

353,mikeupd,Brilliant social commentary...,9,22 July 2006,"This film must rank along with the 'angry young men' films of the 1960s for it's gritty subject material and portrayal. Set again the background/backdrop of working mens struggle to do the only job they have and the gradual acceptance of the family towards the sons ballet classes. This should be compulsory viewing for all those studying English/UK 20th Century social history along with many other gritty Northern England socio-documentary style films such as 'Brassed Off.' The Transporter Bridge at Middlesborough, a piece of wonderful engineering, gets a look in also. The old Newcastle 'National Express' coach station also shown. Such an emotional finale... In my top ten UK films.",Billy Elliot
354,x-x-ren-x-x,A very successful film.,10,1 June 2008,"Billy Elliot is a heart-warming tale that brings out sadness, anger and laughter captivating the viewer throughout the whole film. There is an obvious musical, comedy and drama theme, as seen in The Full Monty and East is East, this makes it fun to watch and appealing to all ages. The poster used to promote the film is successful in setting the story, targeting all audiences while making it seem interesting. Jamie Bell plays Billy, a fiery, emotional and possibly confused character who is still grieving over the tragic death of his mother. The director, Stephen Daldry, was definitely looking for a 'raw talent' to play this diverse and intriguing young boy; seeing as Jamie had little acting experience and no dancing knowledge, he must have seemed perfect to play the role. All of the actors live up to expectations, especially Julie Walters who comes from the other end of the spectrum, being very popular and with years of experience. She fits into her character's personality instantly because she plays many 'motherly' roles, such as Molly Weasley in Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince and Aunt Betsy Trotwood in David Copperfield. Daldry seems to enjoy producing or directing films in the drama genre, he directed The Reader and another short film Eight, which features the same kind of journey Billy Elliot undertakes; having to cope with the loss of a parent and discovering a new interest that changes their life. As well as this, Billy is constantly in disagreement with his father who deals with his grief in an extremely aggressive way. He is also involved in the miner's strike that severely affected the family's income and interferes with Billy's aspirations. The saddening situations make the viewer sympathise with Billy, and to a certain extent; his family.Brian Tufano and his crew are very talented in deciding what camera angles and type of shots to use in certain scenes. For example; being able to portray emotions through angles of the camera and make a scene look better on camera than it does when filming. This is also enhanced by editing techniques used by John Wilson and the editorial team. They provide a gentle transition from one scene to another without losing the storyline and in some parts, the mood of particular scenes change so rapidly, the viewer is taken aback. Without editing, this film would not have been achieved to such a high standard and would not have been as successful in emphasising emotions and events. The colour also compliments the film and the period, with nothing too bright and the interiors of the houses typical to the 1980's with patterned wallpaper and frosted glass. Stephen Warbeck uses T.Rex's catchy 'I Love to Boogie' to begin the film. Other artists such as Stephen Gately, Eagle-Eye Cherry, The Clash, The Jam and The Style Council also feature in the film. Most of the sounds are diegetic, which enables the film to be more realistic to the audience; however, the few non-diegetic parts do not detract from the scenes. Set in the mid 1980's in a small estate with all families on a similar income, it reminds the people aged between the ages of 30 and 40 who may have experienced the affects of the minor strike had on the community. While appealing to the older audience, the story still interests teenagers, especially the youths who enjoy dance. There is a comical aspect to this film, for example, when Billy is attempting a 'pirouette' in the bathroom (to make sure his father doesn't find out about the ballet lessons) but fails miserably falling in the bath and soaking himself. In addition, Billy's friend, Michael Caffrey played by Stuart Wells, is discovered by Billy to be dressed up in his sister's clothes and putting make-up on, obviously hinting at his homosexuality. Billy is encouraged to attend boxing sessions by his father who had been taught that he needed to be masculine to get somewhere in the world, but this is something that Billy doesn't want to pursue. Julie Walters plays Mrs Wilkinson, an average but troubled ballet teacher who persuades Billy to join a class, something that Billy knew his father would be fuming about. Walter's character seems to be disappointed in herself for not being good enough to make a successful career in ballet, so she tries to channel that frustration through to her female students that simply don't have that spark of talent. However, Billy Elliot does show an indescribable something that she knows could take him to a future that she hoped for, but only with the right training. Because of this, she provides the role of a mother as well as a coach for Billy; this automatically makes the viewer have a respected opinion of her. All the characters, especially Julie Walters, perfected the language and accent that is needed to professionalise the film. This would have proved difficult to some who have had no experience of speaking in a Northeastern accent because it is such a vital aspect. Jamie Bell was at an advantage because he came from a similar area and already had the blunt and sometimes comic accent. However, it may be difficult for people who do not recognise this style of speech and they may not be able to relate to the film as well as people who are familiar with it. Despite some minor errors, the film was loved by the public, and praised by the critics. It shows that being a dancer is more difficult than first expected, and is in some ways deemed to be similar to the physically exhausting mining job his father does. In my opinion, Billy Elliot is an extremely successful film and many feel that it is 'the best British movie for years'.",Billy Elliot
355,novak2009,I'm totally immune to this charmless little twit.,4,11 February 2009,"Although BILLY ELLIOTT is an okay film, it certainly isn't a great masterpiece.I'm bewildered by the fact that Billy Elliott himself is such an unlikeable young boy. He's a foul-mouthed homophobe and certainly no better than the father he claims is holding him back in life. I'm totally immune to this charmless little twit.And, except for one exuberant, and actually enjoyable, few minutes in a scene with Julie Walters, there's really no clear evidence that young Billy is remotely ready for the Royal Ballet. None at all.When it first came out there were a lot of critics piling praise on this film and I stupidly thought it would be a good show. But when I went to see it I was very annoyed that it was just the same collection of tired clichés that make up the so-called ""feel-good"" movies"" of the last decade or so.BILLY ELLIOTT is just another in a long line of mediocre films that include such dross as FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (totally unfunny from start to finish), NOTTING HILL (ugh), LITTLE VOICE (potentially a great film spoiled by unnecessary foul language) and THE FULL MONTY (a ghastly film filled with ugly, ugly people) that have somehow made an impression on people and I don't know why.Now BILLY ELLIOTT has become a world-wide hit all over again as a stage musical! There seems to be no logical reason for the general public's taste...or, in this case, lack of it.Let's hope there's no film version of BILLY ELLIOTT: The Musical, or we could have another MAMMA MIA! inflicted upon the world.",Billy Elliot
356,kelly-itc,My best movie Billy Eliot.,9,18 March 2009,"I introduce this movie. The movie is very great everything of movie. Billy tries to overcome his father's disappointment about ballet dance. Billy's father joined a demonstration of employee of coal mining industry. Billy's father thinks ballet is a girl's dance and boxing is boy's sports. Billy's dancing overcame the dissension of his father. Finally, Billy was able to enter national ballet school. During Billy's audition into the school, the Interviewer's questioned Billy. ""What do you feel like when you are dancing?"" Billy said ""So good I forgot everything and then flying like a bird"" I was impressed by the scene. I don't know 1984 of England, but I seem to be know a little more about England. I felt wonderful that the boy move forward in his dream. The movie is very sad because father wept tears for Billy's dream. Every time I see this movie I feel strong emotions.",Billy Elliot

Although until now I have never actively included this movie in my list of favorite films, I just realised how excellent it really is- even the fourth time around, it made me cry several times, and the feeling at the end before the adult Billy jumps onto the stage is just as indescribable as it was the first time. After the movie ended I ran around the house with a huge grin on my face, filled with all sorts of poignant feelings.. this is a movie which makes me want to put on that music and dance (even if I would look very silly)and do all of those things I have ever dreamt of doing. A movie which reminds me of why it is so wonderful to be alive and to have an imagination. A film can do no more. I hope this movie will be the classic it deserves to be!!!",Billy Elliot
358,vicky-e,"""A touching movie""",10,5 August 2009,"In my opinion ""Billy Elliot"" is a touching movie that motivates the audience to cogitate. The message of the movie ""Billy Elliot"" is that although you haven't got money you can realize your dream. Furthermore this movie is informative as it points out you should never give up despite a huge number of people who don't believe in you.The setting is a coal mining area in Great Britain with the history background of a strike against the closing of the coal mines that brings penury in the area. I guess the most important message of this movie is that even if the worst circumstances control, a marvel is possible. For this reason I could watch the movie more times. It is so fascinating that this young boy didn't capitulate although his father, his brother and all the others first deem him gay. A very important scene is the gathering in which Billy's father and his brother try to collect money for Billy due to the fact that Tony really stands up for his brother for the first time. In this moment Tony doesn't care what the others could think. Till then the strong brotherly feelings for Villy didn't become apparent. However now the audience see that Billy can count on his brother Tony.The only aspect I was bothered by was the music in the beginning of the movie. It was too loud to understand Billy's voice. But all in all it is an excellent movie.",Billy Elliot
359,hjcohen,Best film since Richard Attenborough's Gandhi!!!!!,10,27 January 2003,"It is almost impossible to write in words (especially for a non-English speaker) the impact this film has had on me when I first saw it. I can say it in one word only: fabulous, fantastic, moving, touching, great, must-see, incredible. And of course Jamie Bell is the top star. His acting and dancing is phenomenal. The best dancing act is when you see him dancing and tapping on the roof of a shed next to his house and in the streets, after Mrs. Wilkinson pays a visit to his house to inform his family about the audition. You see Billy literally breaking free from his brick confinement. What more can I say. To me this film ranks among the top-5 best films ever made.",Billy Elliot
360,The_Key,Beautiful,10,1 July 2003,"What a fantastic movie.  Stephen Daldry's first film is charming, funny at times, dramatic, tragic, and in the end, brilliant.  Jamie Bell leads a strong cast, all giving affecting and moving performances, and delivers an excellent script by Lee Hall.  What i loved best about the movie was the bittersweet quality to it, an element that really brought the film to life, as well as bringing the viewer closer to the characters.  This is a movie that has stayed with me since watching it, not necessarily for depth of storyline or complexity(the story was fairly simple, yet moving) or even because of the moral of the story(which never really affected me, to tell you the truth), but because it was different, it was uplifting, and the characters, just to be frank, grow on you. There are some very memorablescenes, and one in particular aroused in me the most intense feelings of tension i've felt from a film in a long time: the audition, and that's just one of quite a few. Overall, a sensational film that will stay with you.  Go Billy!",Billy Elliot

Hard to believe it came out so long ago, in 2000, when it still seems pretty recent to me! Haha I must be getting old.Anyway it's a simple enough story but they do it very well. I have also seen the musical version of the story but I didn't like it quite as much as the movie.The boy playing Billy is great and all the performances work very well in the film. You really root for him to win his dreams but also for his family to be OK. A great movie!",Billy Elliot

The movie is a heartwarming crowd-pleaser.One has to truly appreciate the performance of Jamie Bell as Billy Elliot. The most memorable part of the movie are the characters especially Billy's Dad. Billy Elliot is exactly what you expect from BBC films and Arts Council of England. There is no need for an in-depth analysis of the subtle plot, because there is not one present. But the movie excels in portraying the struggle of miner's union against Margret Thatcher's Government.

363,Joelcambourne,billy Elliot,9,7 November 2013,"As i was told of that my class would be watching the movie Billy Elliot is was not impressed, the thought of watching a movie for nearly two hours about a young boy living in a struggling town who strays away from what a normal boy of his time would do and take up ballet did not appeal to me. As the movie started i was very optimistic about whether i should turn my head away and gaze at the schools harbour views or sit there starring at the projector in front of me not knowing what i should expect. Surprisingly as the movie went on and i knew more deeply about what the characters situations were i became like what i was seeing. I was fascinated by what was happening to all of the miners in the town and the struggles they faced in getting food on the table for their families, but when Billy decided to continue to do ballet without his father knowing i knew i had to continue watching. The film engaged me in listening to the characters and knowing what they felt. I wanted to know what Mrs. Wilkinson was feeling as she realized what great talent billy had and i also wanted to know what was going to happen once Billy's father had found out and what Mrs. Wilkinson did to try and keep billy at the ballet lessons. When his father finally let go of his emotions towards Billy's going to ballet and excepted him for it on the cold Christmas night it was great to watch. When Billy's dad chose to boycott the strike and go back to work it showed how much love he had for his son and knew that if ballet was truly what Billy wanted to do he would not stop him. I believe the film Billy Elliot is great in showing that it is okay to go away from the typical gender stereotypes and to do what you love with out worrying about anyone else.

364,sarkhan_hashimov,Piece of Art,8,25 March 2019,"Billy Elliot courageously showcases the truthfulness of art through self-dedication and self-awareness. It is the birth of a piece of art independent of richness, higher class, elite education and all other things that tries to coop up the art in its common sense (or commoner) limits.However, the movie is so smooth that the viewer isn't filled with fierce emotions. How come a movie like that doesn't twitch the nerve end?! It is a very lean and simple, but not a banal cinematography, keeping its quality throughout the movie.",Billy Elliot
365,anna-ilona,A classic,8,21 July 2013,"I saw this very young and I did not quite understand, but I saw it many times after that and I understood that this movie is something big. It really did help me to have a good and realistic picture of the world. Jamie Bell is doing an incredible job as the little boy with a screwed up family. But it turns and I am really happy for that. In the end, last scene when both Billys best friend from when they where young and Billys dad is watching him dancing the swan lake on the ballet is perfect. And I hope that my children and your children will watch this when they are the same age as me. Because this history is brilliant. It does not matter how old you are you can learn something from this movie. Billy Elliot learned me that I can do whatever I like even though it is not common or popular. I am myself and nobody can change me.",Billy Elliot
366,threegorges,There are many things this film is not about...so look to the soul.,10,29 July 2007,"Set amid, not so much against, a backdrop of Margaret Thatcher's war with the striking miners of 1984, this film is not about the strike even though it is evident and nearly dominant in much of the movie. Billy's father, his brother, his deceased mother, his friends, his teacher, his town--all play major roles that form the body of this cinematic triumph--and yet the film is not really about any or all of them either. Nor is it really about Billy. Those elements and more make up the story, but even the story is not what this film is about.It is not about The Dance, but the dance is what lifts Billy to that ethereal place, akin perhaps to an akashic journey, wherein he comes to understand his own soul and enables his hard, basic, mining community to taste and savor the kiss of supreme triumph, the achievement of knowing who you truly are and knowing that you truly are a thing of glory...in those magical moments of flight. And therein resides what Billy Elliot is about.If you haven't seen it, please do. See it alone. See it with someone you love. See it again.This movie should have been nominated for and should have won more awards than it did. How could Jamie Bell not have been nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe and more? This masterpiece did receive a lot of recognition, I will readily admit, but one suspects that the politics of that generic ""Hollywood"" drove others to glory instead.No matter. Billy Elliot will not mind; it will just live on, enriching souls.",Billy Elliot
367,caleb_j_muir,Good,8,6 November 2013,Billy Elliot is about a young boy who struggles with generally male sports such as boxing but finds a unexpected love in ballet. Billy must face obstacles such as his father and older brother not supporting him at all and having to have private lessons with his dance teacher behind his fathers back as he forbids him to take classes. This movie is very good how it challenges gender stereotypes such as only girls can do ballet and that all male ballet dancers are gay. When his father walks in on Billy showing his best friend one of his dances he realises how talented his son is in dance he goes back to work as a miner. This was hard for Billy's Dad as he was on strike and if he returned to work he would be known as scum. Billy's Father needed to go back so he would be able to fund for Billy to go to London to audition for the Royal School of Ballet. Billy Elliot is very inspirational as it promotes the fact that you shouldn't change what you enjoy doing just because of what everyone else says about it.,Billy Elliot
368,jane1henders,"wonderful, simple story",9,3 April 2005,"What a treat to see on DVD a film which I loved from the second it began with its tacky 70's style music. the boy is so innocent and his family irritated me at first but then i began to really understand what was going on. I thought the only bad thing was the cliché stuff with the people who interviewed Billy. Otherwise, fabulous. If Biritish movie were more like this I would go more to see them when they first come out. I am new to this experience and am trying to see films which are a bit different to the normal Hollywood stuff. I liked the feeling that I was able to recognise the world of Billy - it seemed familiar although I was brought up very conventionally. The photography was special and i absolutely adored the scenes at the end in the theatre. I cried. Lovely film.",Billy Elliot
369,jovach,Excellent film,10,27 March 2006,"I watched this film last several days ago with my friends. The scene of this film ""Billy Elliot, Der Tanzer"" is still deeply in my imagination. Because my friends and me are all university students and work closely to the field of social science, we really admire the excellent involvement and relation between and within the family members of Billy. With some minor changes and careful explanation, this film should be used as an educational purpose for young students to encourage them to find out their own hidden talent regardless to the negative effect of the world outside. Finally, we all agree to rate this film 10 on 10 !!! Pravo",Billy Elliot
370,mdsmith1002000,A must see movie,10,18 October 2005,"This movie has it all! It make you laugh, cry and cheer. A wonderful movie with outstanding performances. Definitely classic material. Julie Walters should have received an Oscar for her performance as Mrs. Wilkenson. Jamie Bell did a magnificent job as Billy Elliot. He expressed so much compassion, sincerity and honesty. He really did perform his character as if it were is own story. The other characters (Dad & Brother) were also well performed, however, I still feel that Julie Walters and Jamie Bell were the team that made this movie so good. If you have not seen Billy Elliot, go out right now and rent it or better yet, buy it. Watch it often as you will never tire of it!!",Billy Elliot
371,cocalenacola,BILLY ELLIOT IS PERFECTION,10,18 April 2018,"This movie was PERFECT I TELL YOU. PERFECT.

372,wiaaalders,One of my favourite movies,10,12 October 2019,"It has everything, the problems of northern England, the death of the mother, the genes of the grandmother, the passion of the boy, dedication, love, humour, pride, it has it all. And the grand finale is just breathtaking. Can't watch this movie without crying. I would give 12 stars!",Billy Elliot
373,sgdahlia,Too relatable,10,24 February 2019,Billy's hardship and ultimate triumph made me tear up. It's a film with the right mix of humour and relatable experiences.,Billy Elliot
374,georgiamknight,a great movie,10,4 July 2018,"A great heart warming film that touches the soul of its viewers. Billy Elliot is funny, and tender, the mother and son relationship between Billy and Mrs. Wilkinson is certainly endearing to any audience.",Billy Elliot
375,loveution,Magnificent movie,10,20 December 2008,"Honestly, I really can't believe that the current rate is only 7.7! Somehow I've overlooked this movie for 8 years. In my opinion ""Billy Elliot"" is a masterpiece. Breath taking photography, scenery. Excellent cast specially by young Jamie Bell (Billy) and Gary Lewis (Billy's father). Above all I enjoyed the story which becomes so alive due to a director's talent. It's a moving love story between a boy and his father, a story field with emotions like despair, anger, sorrow and love. All inspired by an excellent choice of music. This is the first movie that made me login and rate it with a perfect 10!Tarig",Billy Elliot
376,conor-crunk,Great capturing movie,10,12 February 2006,"In a small town in Durham there is a boy named Billy Elliot played by Jamie Bell, who has the ambition to become a professional ballet-dancer. Unfortunately his brother Tony (Jamie Draven) and his father (Gary Lewis) don't want him to take up ballet as they find it ""girly"". Billy Elliot lives in a crap house with his brother, his father (Jackie) and his grandmother (Jean Heywood). Jackie and Tony work as coal miners, but during the movie they are on a strike due to their low salaries. This makes their household stressful as they have no income. Jackie decides to send his son to boxing lessons (which he can barely afford), but Billy secretly quits boxing and takes up ballet. Billy started dancing because he always had the talent in him. He inherited this talent from his dead mother (Jamie Birkett) and his grandmother. At ballet school we are introduced to Billy's ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters). Mrs. Wilkinson is a very strict Ballet teacher who molds Billy's natural ballet talents into perfection. After a couple of ballet lessons later Billy's dad finds out that Billy has taken up ballet. Jackie is very angry with Billy at this moment so he forbids Billy from going to Ballet. After this incident Billy has to take private lessons with Mrs. Wilkinson. Mrs. Wilkinson kindly offers him these lessons because she believes that Billy has the potential to go to the ""Royal Ballet School"" in Newcastle. Unfortunately Billy has to miss his audition since Tony got into a load of trouble with the police. Tony got into trouble with the police since he was the ring-leader the protesters. Later on we find out if Billy will become go to the royal ballet school, or if he will be forced to give up his dream because of his family.",Billy Elliot
377,gardnerj-3,Truly Amazing!,10,26 March 2006,"This film came out, when I was younger, I was too young to understand and relate to the movie- I was only 10. Now I am 15, it was on TV last night; I was in aw throughout the whole movie. I couldn't believe that this movie existed when I was alive-- and it was out on the selves in the DVD shop down the road. I think I was living under a rock.I forgot how to cry before I watched this movie.I come from a wealthy, high class family in Australia. I go to a private school and I am not usually around people with broken homes or around people in a low socio-economic area. I am blinded by the people around me about the depression and horrible taunts of people with limited needs. Very few movies actually make me think- this is a testament to that, showing that this movie has motivated me to write a comment on this website, so the whole world can see views.This movie moved me in ways that I never thought something could. Since I am only young, I haven't experienced much in my life, while I am growing and I discovering new feelings and this movie has triggered oneit's become apart of me.Showing that he came from a poor and broken family, and relished in his dream to become a ballet dancer and escape his born destiny to become a minerit's just unbelievable.Since I come from a wealthy family, with so many opportunities around me, it made me think about what I am taking for granted, this movie has changed me-- since Friday night I have watched it about 6 times over and over again. I am now taking in my lifethis movie has showed me that, whatever I am in, or whoever I am, I can do anything that want to be-- a true genius movie",Billy Elliot
