0,SnoopyStyle,moody horror,6,16 February 2021,"A woman is struggling to care for her comatose husband on his death bed and their faltering sheep farm. Something dark is happening. Their adult children, Louise (Marin Ireland) and Michael (Michael Abbott Jr.), return to help.This is a moody little horror. It's a bit quiet and not always that intense. There are some disturbing scenes. The fingers is one of the most disturbing around. Ireland is good at acting scared although scary scenes are few and far between. This has more atmosphere than thrills.",The Dark and the Wicked
1,nogodnomasters,Go Home,5,27 November 2020,"Louise (Marin Ireland ) and Michael (Michael Abbott Jr.) return to their sheep ranch in Thurber, Texas to see their dying father, David (Michael Zagst). He lays in bed with tubes in him and doesn't move. They are there against the wishes of their mother (Julie Oliver-Touchstone) who believes the devil is in the house wanting to take David's soul.The siblings who are not religious begin to see things that appear very real, but are not.The film atmosphere was a constant gray and brown. It was good, but the film left much to be desired. The porch scene of the siblings was boring when it should have created interesting characters. The creep factor was decent but it went nowhere.Guide: F-word. Nudity?",The Dark and the Wicked
2,kosmasp,Life and Death,8,24 August 2021,"And maybe even things in between. If you are into slow burning horror movies, you came to the right place. Not that this does not offer you some jump scares to keep things interesting, but overall it is the creepy and slow build up that will get to you ... no pun intended.Having said that, the movie and the performances match the mood the movie sets and you can feel it crawling towards you. I suspect some will have issues watching this ... Be aware it will not be easy! I like movies like that as you can tell, you have to know your own taste of course.",The Dark and the Wicked
3,paul_haakonsen,More like the mundane and the pointless...,3,17 November 2020,"I was lured in to sitting down to watch the 2020 movie ""The Dark and the Wicked"" given the movie's poster/cover and the fact that it was a new horror movie that I hadn't seen already. And given my love and admiration for the horror genre, of course I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch this 2020 movie from writer and director Bryan Bertino.And while the movie is heavily atmospheric and brooding, then the movie's storyline was just so horribly bland and pointless actually. I sat through the entire movie feeling remotely entertained, and I was just hoping and waiting for the movie to pick up its pace and deliver something extraordinary. The movie is long finished now, and I am still waiting...The storyline was just uneventful and it made for a very prolonged movie experience. And since I sat there waiting for something grand or even remotely scary to happen, the time just felt like it was dragging on and on forever. Don't get your hopes up for this being a thrill-ride of a horror experience.It should be said, though, that the acting performances in the movie were good. I do enjoy watching a movie where I am not familiar with the actors and actresses, and that was the case in ""The Dark and the Wicked"".Visually, as I mentioned earlier, the movie is very atmospheric. The movie is, however, not a movie that is heavily reliant on special effects, so you are not in a for a grand display of CGI or practical effects. There were some interesting enough bloody scenes in the movie though, they were few, but they were there at least.All in all, I found ""The Dark and the Wicked"" to be a swing and a miss from writer and director Bryan Bertino. And it wasn't an entertaining movie experience for me. As such, I am rating it a mere three out of ten stars, and that is on a generous notion even.",The Dark and the Wicked
4,BandSAboutMovies,Questions you should not ask,3,18 February 2021,"The feeling that I get twenty minutes into a horror movie should be, ""Where is this going to go next?"" not ""When are they going to screw this up?"" But alas, this is 2021, when mumblecore horror and overpraised elevated nonsense and A24 movies with great trailers and horrible full-length stories are the norm. So yeah, twenty minutes into The Dark and the Wicked and I was getting the answer to that question.Bryan Bertino made The Strangers and wrote the not-as-good sequel, as well as movies like Mockinbird and The Monster. This time, he's gone back to his family's farmhouse to tell the story of what happens when your mother tells you that you should never come back home.The first fifteen minutes of this movie hit home in a way that few movies have in some time. Over the last year, my mother has had to care for my father, a man who is totally there one day and then gone mentally for days at a time. It's not as horrible as this movie, where the father is slowly dying and the mother is the only one there, calling her children back home to let them see him before he dies.Then, you know, the dad shows up as a demon to scare the daughter while she's in the shower and the effect is really, really bad and then you realize that no matter how well art directed the beginning of this movie is, how great the trailer is and how cool the poster is art designed, this movie is going to be the same possession tropes that we've seen before.Which is a shame, because the darkness of the opening is brutal. It is everything that loss feels like. I have no idea how you keep a movie going with that level of pure bleakness, but this movie does not do that.Instead, it becomes a movie where I continually look at the time to see how much is left of it, which I hate, because I was with this movie and wanted so much more than a floating mom outside and a preacher who calls to mind Reverend Kane, which is not the intention but at this point, I started thinking of movies that really scared me.Elevated horror wants to mean so much more than just being frightening. Cool story. And I want these movies to be successful. But you know, there have been movies that take horrifying moments out of real life, like Rosemary's Baby and childbirth, Don't Look Now and the loss of a child, The Shining and the pains of being a parent (and selfishly for me, the fact that no one understands just how hard it is to be a writer when everyone keeps bothering you) and, well, I could go on. What films like this, The Babadook and yeah every Ari Aster movie gets wrong is that you can make a movie about those moments and still be frightening.Eh, I'm probably just being a jerk by comparing three of the best horror movies ever against movies that can barely get noticed outside of film twitter geeks who just want to have something that can belong to them. You have to feel for that kind of spirit, I guess.You can still think these are bad movies.But don't make the mistakes I did. When you see that cool poster or DVD cover, when you watch that trailer, when you see the cool look that this starts with, maybe you can beat the disappointment of this unlike me.",The Dark and the Wicked
5,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Dark and chilling genre effort,10,31 December 2020,"Upon arriving at her family's farm, a woman intending to help look after her sick father with the rest of her brothers becomes concerned when something strange starts happening to her and everyone else on the farm, and upon eventually learning the truth forces them to fight off its effects together to stop it from spreading.For the most part, this was an exceptionally enjoyable and chilling effort. One of the film's brightest features is the seemingly desolate and dark atmosphere that permeates the house from the second we arrive. The chill in the air and depressing vibe from her family denote something awful is about to happen before anything actually does as the strained family relationship being evident trying to care for their invalid grandfather being sick and in bed only adds to the dreaded air on display. When the incidents start piling up and the horrific nature of what's happening to them becomes apparent this early setup is an appropriate setup for those events and creates plenty of chilling work to come from the film. Once those events start happening, the film picks up considerably. The opening incident with the finger chopping only to be discovered in the morning hanging from a suicide noose in the barn gives this a shocking and equally tragic start to things which veers away from that nicely into the chilling realm. From the minor tactics which include creepy shots of disfigured beings standing suddenly behind someone or hallucinations of themselves with imaginary wounds to much more troubling such as the suspected-imaginary incident with the supposedly-invalid grandfather appearing to torment her only to be alone when help arrives, there's a lot to like here. This becomes even more of a plus once the film moves into the third act and offers up tons of impressive elements. That the attacks here become far more gruesome and chilling, featuring the deformed beings arriving at the house and forcing them to commit graphic suicide after seeing them, attacks throughout the house and barn where they continually encounter the presence of the beings around them. That these encounters provide scores of brutal and bloody deaths brought about through some wholly unnatural means showing the influence and power of the beings around them, adds that much more power to what unfolds in a truly dark and chilling finale. All told, these are what hold the film up even though there are some issues to be had with this one. One of it's biggest flaws is the dreary and incredibly measured pacing that this one works through, drawing itself out to a rather obviously slow tempo that may not work for some. Those will find this a drag with the films' insistence on keeping everything at the same even-keeled pitch throughout which offers more of a dramatic flair that may not drive home the horror-action as often as some viewers would want. The other factor to be had here is the seeming inability to recognize that something's wrong and needs to be resolved, as the escalation of events and murders that take place here demand attention from outside sources that don't happen at all here making it feel unrealistic that they'd stick around for all that happens here. These are just the only detrimental factors though.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",The Dark and the Wicked
6,trashgang,slow and creepy,7,13 March 2021,"Been a while since I've seen a new flick with all those covid situations. But hey, slowly they do appear here and there let this be one of those new ones.Why I picked this one was the fact I was told it was gory. Can't agree on that part but what it did do was the fact that it was creepy as hell.The score, the darkness, slowly gets you by the throat. And it's a slow mover that is in fact a horror but not for everyone. Can't say a thing about the story except the devil, I think, was involved.When things go wrong it is bloody and maybe somethings are a bit gory for those not used to see a flick from the horror genre.One to watch alone, in the dark, and just wait until the wicked comes in.

7,deloudelouvain,Not that good to be honest.,5,9 March 2021,"The ratings for The Dark And The Wicked are a bit too elevated in my humble opinion. There's definitely a dark athmosphere throughout the movie but to say it's a good movie is a bit far fetched. For that the story wasn't good enough, it didn't make much sense and went all over the place, not very satisfying to watch. There are some creepy scenes but that's about it, the rest is just not that entertaining. The acting was decent, too bad the story wasn't.",The Dark and the Wicked
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The dull and the boring.,4,10 October 2021,"'The Dark And The Wicked (2020)' is a nihilistic horror film about a brother and sister who return to their family farm in order to spend time with their dying father. When they arrive, they realise that all is not well; their mother doesn't want them to stay. Soon, it becomes increasingly clear that their family has been chosen by some form of dark force intent on making them suffer. The picture is a brooding slow-burn that places emphasis on dark atmosphere and infrequent yet impactful bursts of mostly self-inflicted violence. Unfortunately, though, it's much more boring than it is portentous. Although its general vibe is disquieting and it has several scenes that are genuinely quite unnerving (mostly due to their graphic nature), the flick just isn't all that engaging. Its characters aren't given any depth and its central situation remains somewhat stagnant throughout. It obviously escalates to a certain extent, but the plot is pretty flat and the scares are often uninspired. It's generally well crafted and features some solid, if unremarkable, performances. Plus, as I mentioned, some of its scenes do get under your skin (again, more due to their explicit nature than any sort of especially inspired filmmaking). However, it ultimately isn't all that interesting. It's basically horror 101; we've seen it all before. Plus, its potentially allegorical central premise isn't really explored at all beyond being presented as a starting point for its frights. The biggest issue with the affair is that it's honesty rather boring. It just doesn't do anything for me, really. 4/10.",The Dark and the Wicked
9,ops-52535,above average within its branch of genre,6,7 November 2020,"But unphatomingly excrusiating slow horror movie, even though its well made and the creeps comes sneaking along your spine, its slow and unreachable at some levels. who is the real culprit in this case is difficult to tell while watching, and the aftermath tells you that this was everlasting and not temptativ to rewatch..so if you want to have a trip to the vast windblown and grey and shadowless plains of usa with a little bit of this and that horror at a clockworks playtime, then have a look. its tough meat for the depressive viewer, thats my only caution, so its a small recommend from the grumpy old man",The Dark and the Wicked
10,paulclaassen,Foreboding and creepy!,6,2 August 2021,"'The Dark and the Wicked' is foreboding from the very start - indeed dark and rather wicked!A Mother, Virginia, is looking after her terminally ill husband at home, refusing to let him go to hospital. Her daughter, Louise, and son, Michael, are called upon to pay their last respects before he dies. Virginia is still taking care of the chores around the house and and its starting to take its toll on her. Louise and Michael notices this, but also find it difficult having a conversation with their mother. With things not ok between the siblings, things get even worse after a tragic incident.'The Dark and the Wicked' doesn't make use of all the regular haunted house/evil cliches; it creates new ones - and they're really creepy! This film is a tense nail-biter that keeps the viewer glued to the screen, wondering what's going to happen next. The suspense is relentless. The acting - especially Marin Ireland as Louise - is very good. Unfortunately, though, the sound wasn't that great and I couldn't always clearly hear what some of the characters were saying.Nevertheless, if you're a genre fan, you should definitely watch 'The Dark and the Wicked'. The film certainly saved the horror and disturbing moments for the finale. I guarantee you won't be satisfied with the ending, but it's still all good. Evil comes in many shapes and sizes...",The Dark and the Wicked
11,eddie_baggins,A slowly paced horror without the pay-off needed to make it worth your time and patience,5,14 July 2021,"Just his fourth feature film and third since his well-received debut The Strangers way back in 2008, director Bryan Bertino returns to our screens with Shudder's latest high-profile horror offering The Dark and the Wicked, a slowly paced affair that shuns jump scares for mood and atmosphere as siblings Michael and Louise Straker return to their family farm to find a homestead overtaken by grief, fear and possibly something sinister.Intending to help their mother tend to their ailing father who remains bed-ridden throughout the days and nights spent on the Straker property, Michael Abbott Jr's Michael and Marin Ireland's Louise quickly begin to realize that not all is going smoothly at their old place of residence, whether its the odd instances occurring in the animal quarters or their mothers undesirable cooking preparations, the Straker farm is a place that doesn't appeal for a visit.Wicked certainly strikes up a quickly established mood and vibe and it feels somewhat similar to films such as The Witch and Hereditary in the way it looks to suck its audience in through dread and anticipation, not so much constant gore (of which there are some stomach churning moments of here) and scares but even at 90 minutes of runtime Bertino's film suffers as time wears on with all hopes laying at a big pay-off that never eventuates making this affair a solid enough outing without ever threatening to become more.There's some great central turns at the heart of this depressing horror yarn, both Michael Abbott Jr and Marin Ireland do good work as two in over their heads siblings while Oliver-Touchstone's brief but important role as Virginia provides the film with some of its best and most eerie moments but many viewers will grow tired and weary of a procession of similar events that occur throughout the films lacking mid-section, halting the film in its tracks as it tries to progress towards a memorable and eventful ending.For a low-budget affair the film feels well made and its easily Bertino's best effort behind the camera since he burst onto the scene with The Strangers but his still yet to get close to reaching the horror heights of that feature as Wicked shows shines of something special but falters under the weight of audience's expecting and deserving a little bit more.Final Say -The Dark and the Wicked is better than many counterparts but that's not exactly a glowing endorsement considering the bulk of competition. Starting out with a lot intrigue and hope, this slow and more ponderous horror affair is unable to create anything worthy of much note.2 1/2 messy dinner preps out of 5.",The Dark and the Wicked
12,jtindahouse,A beautiful looking film that is going to unnerve some people,7,6 November 2020,"Roger Ebert once said, ""It's not what a film is about, but how it is about it."" I had to take that into consideration when rating and reviewing 'The Dark and the Wicked'. This is admittedly not my type of horror movie. I struggle with supernatural horror, because I have zero belief in it and thus it does nothing to unsettle me. However, I have to admit that this film was done very well, and that if I were unsettled by those types of films then this one would have done the trick for me. This film is going up some people's alleys big time.This is such a beautifully shot film. Director Bryan Bertino is so good at framing what is on screen, he doesn't even need what's on screen to be all that impressive for it to look good. I also love the inventive camera angles he comes up with. They don't always work to heighten the scares or even the tension, but they add a touch of class to the mix which is so often missing in the horror genre.My biggest gripe with the film would be all the jump-scares and the scenes where the demon is basically just trying to scare the characters rather than harm them. I understand why they have to be there to pad the runtime to 90 minutes, but they are still very frustrating to watch. I also didn't really connect with either of the two lead characters. They were very flat (understandable in their situation to be fair) and that made it difficult for me to care all that much about their fate. The final 20-30 minutes of this film is an absolute blast though I'd have to say. The pacing rockets to life and there are some fun and pretty messed up scenes. 'The Dark and the Wicked' is worth a watch.",The Dark and the Wicked

This is a horror movie written, directed & produced by Bryan Bertino, who had a hand in The Strangers & it's sequel, The Strangers:Prey at Night. Marin & Michael are siblings that return to their parents' farm because their father is dying. Julie plays their mother who tells them that they shouldn't have come-it's too late is one of the reasons given but there are more. One of the first things noticed by Marin & Michael is that their mother is acting strange. Julie cuts off her own fingers and is later found dead, hanging in the barn-pretty strange, right? No sooner are they mourning their mother when Marin & Michael start having waking nightmares of seeing things that should not be seen. There is something evil on the property.
It's not rated but it does contain violence, gore, partial nudity and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright, as a rental.",The Dark and the Wicked

15,yusufpiskin,The Dark And The Wicked > Hereditary,7,13 November 2020,"Really cool, it sets the standards really high....
Well I'll be dammed. Bryan Bertino finally made a horror flick I like. Didn't care for ""The Stranger"" of ""The Monster."" Frankly found them weak, this one was actually genuinely creepy at times. Lot of horror films this year are playing on the theme of loss. I think this one has done it the best so far though. There's a heavy sense of dread and weight carried from the beginning to the end of this film, and it rarely lets up. On top of some gorgeous shots and memorable visual moments. Beyond some funny choice of almost cartoonish ""beast-like"" track samples for some of the sounds, this was damn great and I was engaged. Dig it Bertino.

19,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Dark and the Wicked,5,10 November 2020,"""Told you all not to come"". Uh-oh, I'll bite. Those words while derivative, are never reassuring.Anyhow, 2020's The Dark and the Wicked is my latest write-up. It is well-acted and well cast as it stars unknowns Marin Ireland and Michael Abbott Jr. Things don't bode well for their characters when you think they might. Alas, ""Wicked"" is a rinse, repeat of all things that ""go bump in the night"". It concludes in a sort of confounding dead end.The Dark and the Wicked is a mixed bag for me because it chooses terror-filled ilk over mucho substance. Call it sticky ""wicked"". Using weekday title cards a la The Shining, harboring low camera angles, and containing a look similar to 2018's Hereditary, ""Wicked"" creeps you out occasionally but you'll constantly wonder where it's all headed. Every jump scare, every ghastly image, every delusional grab, and every demonic coy sort of recycles itself into slugged continuum.Distributed by RLJE films, shot in one location via Granbury, Texas, and directed by a guy known for horror fare (Bryan Bertino), The Dark and the Wicked is about a brother and sister who try to fight off an evil entity that has inhabited their grubby farmhouse. They could ""get the heck out"" Amityville Horror-style but their father is dying and they can't move the comatose old-timer.Now does The Dark and the Wicked send you away with your knees knocking? At times yes. Does it run out of wiggle room with all of its fiddling and blood-curdling excess? Sadly it does. ""Wicked"" takes ninety trawling minutes to revel in the hallucinatory, the unsettling, and the stylistic. Rather than tell a cohesive story that seems to start in the middle, director Bertino opts to just tease the audience with the macabre. He doesn't know when to quit.",The Dark and the Wicked
20,pc95,Decent as Horrors go,7,15 February 2021,"(spoilers) I rate this movie as a high 6/low 7. It piles on the foreboding. As with most pure horrors, the characters are in for it from the get-go, and this movie did not stray from that. The terrorizing becomes a bit formulaic as the movie continues, but there are some nice moments of dread. However, I like when horror movies have good back-stories to fill in origins of the evil which this lacks. This is what makes the Exorcist such a good horror movie. Considering more recent horror movies, i liked ""The Witch"" and ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" as a bit better movies, the former being a better story, and the latter for its originality. This is the best horror movie I've seen as of late, burying much higher budget and bloated ""Underwatter"".",The Dark and the Wicked
21,omendata,"Dark , very dark with absolutely no easy payoff",6,7 June 2021,"This one is a hard horror movie to watch and yet it is brim packed with everything that scares you; from the shadows on the wall to the dark figure in the corner of the room, to the gross out scene with the flock of goats and the slick symbolism with the devil and the goats on the farm. The director uses many horror techniques so well it is hard to fault even though the film is very slow and to be fair to the other reviewers it is somewhat boring and will not appeal to many people; even die hard horror fans will find this one hard going!The film gives the viewer no easy ride with no explanations, no backstory, not much characterization and no simple ending but builds such a lugubrious atmosphere of dripping dread in the style of movies like Hereditary that you cannot but be chilled to the bone with its minimal but effective style.I want to give it 4/10 but I have to give it credit for being ""real horror"" and not ""Hollywood horror"" so it gets an always fair and honest review from me with a solid above average 6 hatchets on the horror scale for this very different approach to horror movie making!",The Dark and the Wicked
22,gedikreverdi,This was genuinely scary,7,2 December 2020,"A man bound to bed with his wife in an old farmhouse riddled with animal skulls, -giant wind rose and howling wolves at night and a herd of sheep. Their daughter and son shows up for their father although their mom wants otherwise. She sees a demonic creature all around the house. I could never forget the scene where she chopped her fingers while chopping carrots. Then their children found him hanging from the ceiling of the stable. Then they found her diary and learnt that she was seeing things and the devil wants their fathers soul. The other creepy scene was when the lights turn on by themselves in the sons room and he sees his mom floating out in the air from the window. With time and such things they start to believe there's sth wrong in this farm. They go and see their moms body in the morgue and coroner gives them crosses from her pocket although she was not a believer. That day a priest shows up at their house and talks to them about the devil. Later Louise finds out that that priest doesn't even live in Texas. The dead visit them. Charlie their family's friend sees Louise cutting himself with a knife and that vision makes him kill herself. Then they find the herd butchered in the middle of the field and then they burned them in a huge fire in front of the which felt like a unholy ritual by throwing dead sheep and skeletons into the fire. The other scary scene was the caretaker ladys suicide by poking himself in her body, face and in the eyes. The son leaves house thinking he should be alive for his family and leaves his sister alone in the farm. He sees at his home his daughters and his wife slit their throat and dead. Then he also slits his throat noticing that he was seeing things but it was too late. Back in the farm the daughter is all alone with her dying dad.

23,IonicBreezeMachine,"Strong set up, but leads to an underwhleming payoff.",6,27 October 2021,"At a family farm in Texas, estranged siblings Louise (Marin Ireland) and Michael (Michael Abbott Jr.) return when their father's (Michael Zagst) illness that keeps him bedridden takes a turn for the worse. Their father has been cared for by their mother (Julie Oliver-Touchstone) and a home care nurse (Lynn Andrews). When their mother inexplicably commits suicide within a day after returning home, Louise and Michael are left to care for their ailing father only to find some creeping evil may have been responsible for both their father's illness and mother's suicide.The Dark and the Wicked is the latest film from The Strangers and The Monster writer/director Bryan Bertino. Similar to Bertino's other works, the movie is a slow burning character piece using familiar horror setups and iconography in a very personal film for Bertino. Written at and staged at Bryan Bertino's family farm residence, the movie deals with the very real fear of losing one's parents as we grow older ourselves and find ourselves isolated and distant with a fear of the inevitable. It's certainly a strong and very human fear, but does it make for a strong film?The movie is great at establishing a sense of loneliness and isolation as once we arrive at this farm, we seldom, if ever, see outside of it. Pretty much the entire movie is et over the course of a week on this farm with only various characters dropping by for one reason or another. Marin Ireland and Michael Abbott Jr. Are good in their roles as estranged adult siblings Louise and Michael, as is Julie Oliver-Touchstone as their mother who's stricken with grief. These three performances are what the movie is built upon and because of the movie's lack of dialogue relative to other films of this ilk, the character comes through much more from what's unsaid rather than what is. The farm is a nicely realized set piece feeling like a rustic place out of time with the feeling that while the rest of the world moved on this place never followed with it. The rustic isolation helps to sell the film's atmosphere of creeping dread and slow rot and makes the film feel tangible in an unsettling way.The movie is a slow burn and it does take a while to get going, especially with the first act. The movie also feels like it plays a little bit fast and loose with its logic particularly in the end where it seems like there's a divergence between the themes the film addresses and how they're executed. The movie also at certain points evokes comparison to Bryan Bertino's The Strangers albeit with a supernatural bent. It's not that there aren't effective scenes or moments that stand on their own, but I did find myself comparing moments between films and feeling the first incarnation had more impact.The Dark and the Wicked is stylish and well-acted, but it's also very slow with not much of a payoff. I did enjoy the performances from the leads and the atmosphere that was created, but as the movie went on I found myself less engaged with not all that much resonating with me beyond the initial setup. I think The Lodge did a lot of the same things The Dark and The Wicked did but with more fine tuning and thematic resonance.

There is not one moment in ""The Dark & the Wicked' where you think, ""Hey, that's original."" More than anything else, this film was simply a way of rehashing the most familiar horror tropes in existence. To wit: 1. Person magically attached to the ceiling looking down? Check. 2. Watching a strange character from a distance, then turning away for a second, then turning back to see the strange character has disappeared? Check. 3. Little girl who suddenly has a devil voice? Check. I'm surprised she also doesn't speak backwards or Latin! 4. Possessed priest? Check. And what's the deal with the dangling bottles and bits of metal across the entrance of the barn? Don't they have barn doors in Texas? 5. Long, slooooooow movements of the characters? Check. 6. Ghostly figures who pop up (accompanied by a loud noise) behind a character, then are not there when the character turns around? Check. Why didn't they have a black cat suddenly screeching while diving in through a window? No cats on the set, I guess. They were right about the movie being dark. That, it was. But do they expect us to believe a Texas farm family are atheists and the nurse can show them the error of their wicked wicked ways? Ridiculous. And why was there no police investigation of the mother's unusual death, that by hanging with no stool beneath her? Preposterous.

I am actually surprised by the relatively low rating.If only it had fewer jump scares and more interesting dialogue it would've been just perfect (maybe also a little less repeating scares).All the subtle creepy imagery was great, and I loved the ending. If they would show less of the Wicked and make it even more subtle...Anyway, it's a great horror film with amazing performances.

28,SoumikBanerjee25,Good Enough Indie Horror!,7,31 May 2021,"Bertino's ""The Dark and the Wicked"" played more on the eerie and unnerving vibes as opposed to placing due emphasis on its narrative. An indie horror that has indeed managed to make me uncomfortable & intimidated in parts. However, due to the relatively uninspired script; It did not go as planned! NOT QUITE!Shot at a countryside farm, miles away from any urban civilization. A secluded place of such alone connotes something sinister! Location-wise, this has been a 'win' from the get-go!Whilst the plot resorts to hackneyed tropes of Horror, the tension slowly accumulates! It's one of those rare occasions where the disconcerting aspects of the predicament gradually grow on you. Besides, this daunting atmosphere patently helps the cause.Apropos of Performances; the entire ensemble as a group did fairly decent. Whereas, Marin Ireland as Louise clearly takes the cake here! I don't know why but she reminded me so much of Toni Collette from Hereditary and that itself Is a great deal of praise I reckon!As I have already drawn comparisons, I shall also cite the key difference therebetween. Hereditary had an in-depth character arc that endorsed Collette's formidable personation. Unlike here, wherein such similar support from the Writing segment is sorely missed. Matter of fact, the grave absence of attainable backstories does stick out like a sore thumb!",The Dark and the Wicked

Otherwise, this film fails mostly given the uncertainty of the story and plot. The father is bedridden dying slowly; the mother loses her mind. The adult brother and sister arrive to take over care. That's about it until we are shown that a supernatural element is out and about the farm. After that, there are attempts to be scary, but they generally only bring creepiness.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this was filmed.Two siblings are summoned to return to their childhood farm house to be with their dying father. This almost sounds like a family drama but this is when the things get interesting with strange happenings occur...It has that foreboding Heredity vibe going for it. The psychological trauma that plays out and the gore make this a compelling watch. The acting is so organic that it enhances the film.This is a good recommendation for anyone that likes a good psychological horror film.",The Dark and the Wicked
32,johannes2000-1,Effective atmospheric horror-movie.,8,5 January 2021,"Although the pace of this movie is rather slow, it does has enough creepiness, some harsh moments of gore and a fair amount of carefully spreaded jump-scares, to make this an effective and enjoyable horror-movie. The tension is meticulously built-up, and the setting in a dismal dilapidated farmhouse adds to the sinister atmosphere. The actors who play the brother and sister characters do a good job, especially Marin Ireland is very convincing as the bewildered and scared out of her wits daughter.If any, my one reservation is the fact (in nowadays horror-movies unfortunately more and more common) that we get no explanation whatsoever of the source and reasons of all these weird occurrences (or I must have missed something).

When we are alone, when we are abandoned by everybody, the demons, the devil find a space, a place to stay, and even those who abandone others are susceptible to this, as they also feel more alone in the process - if you take this as something objective or more subjective, it's up to you.Yeah, I don't give a lot of 5 stars (in the last 10 years, only gave to Get Out and Parasite - and besides Get Out, the only horror movies on that club are The Exorcist and Scream), but this will join that restricted club.",The Dark and the Wicked

37,TwistedContent,"The Orchestra might not have changed, but it all depeneds on the Conductor",7,4 December 2020,"""The Conjuring"" era has given us countless possession, haunted house and thematically similar horror movies, and not all of them great, good or even decent. It's a genre I've been a little tired of, as it has, in my opinion, run somewhat dry, but a solid execution and smart shuffles can change everything. With Bertino's ""The Strangers"" being a notable and influential horror movie for me all those years ago when it came out, I have faithfully watched all his movie when they come out, and ""The Dark and the Wicked"", I'm happy to say, is my second favorite of his.We are welcomed to stay in a secluded and creepy farmhouse, in the nowhere part of a rural region that's just as bleak. Sadness, sickness and unpleasant mystery inhabits this house, in which an old man is dying and his wife is losing her mind. Their children, Louise and Michael, arrive to take care of mom and mourn the father, but encounter also something sinister and increasingly malevolent roaming the farm.""The Dark and the Wicked"" is, for the most part, an old story that ends exactly how I thought it'll end. But predictability factors don't often mean that much, when in comes atmosphere and particular psychological, serious and emotional themes. I'd speculate with some confidence that ""The Dark and the Wicked"" is inspired heavily by the (too slowly) growing surge of bleak psychological horror movies in the latter years, like ""Hereditary"" and ""The Witch"". Bertino's fourth full feature has an atmosphere that tries to compete with that of the aforementioned and similar movies, the thickness of it is fed with themes of family dysfunction, mental illness, guilty conscience and the like. Having said that, ""The Dark and the Wicked"" doesn't plunge depths we've seen elsewhere. The two siblings, portrayed by Marin Ireland and Michael Abbott Jr., are the heart of the story, they are the ones with all the responsibility, tough choices and consequences in the messy and conflictive state of their life, helped made miserable by the evil force. The story ends in a way that's also not anything new, but it fits with film's overall nature. Above all, I believe that such leaning on the mood is intentional, because it's what makes this movie stand out it in its subgenre. I see how ""The Dark and the Wicked"" definitely could've been worse, but, honestly, I don't know how much better it could've been.
The cinematography encompasses the bleakness of the story very successfully, and is colored in a way that could not carry a comedy. The relatively unknown cast delivered good performances - I got to thinking afterwards that the main characters, especially the two siblings, not looking famous and pretty might be a committing factor in a good way.If You enjoy religion/possession/demon/haunting/haunted house horror movies, definitely consider watching ""The Dark and the Wicked"", a well above average example of the subgenre, it has the potential to creep one out. My rating: 7/10.",The Dark and the Wicked

41,deexsocalygal,Scariest movie I've seen in years,10,17 March 2021,"This is a deep, dark, heavy horror movie. The kind I like the most. This isn't the stupid typical teenage slasher. Or the kind where you know what's going to happen before it happens. There's no dingy blondes walking around in bikinis screaming every 5 minutes. No steamy sex scenes with someone getting stabbed in bed. None of that. This is a grown up kind of scary. A slow eerie type of movie that will show you the day to day life of a brother & sister who came home to help their Mama with the farm & their Dad who is in his last dying days. He wants to die at home & is in his bedroom in his last days. They notice Mama isn't herself but she won't clarify what's wrong. It won't take long for brother & sister to start experiencing odd goings on like doors they just locked opening by themselves, lights turning on by themselves, & it gets worse as they slowly start to realize that evil has situated itself inside their farm. The worst kind of evil. The kind you can't see & you can't explain. One day all the sheep are found dead in the field, all torn up & bloody. The first thing they want to blame it on is wolves but they are torn apart in ways that a wolf wouldn't do. The only conclusion you can come to is it's the devil himself which scares them to death. It seems that the devil has laid claim to this family. He must want their souls because he's definitely toying with them. It scared me to death. There isn't any dumb scenes of people doing things you know are idiotic & you want to scream at them, none of that. This is a great realistic spooky movie for grown ups. The kind that only pop up a couple times a year at the most. I highly recommend this. Turn out the lights & pay attention. It'll creep you out.",The Dark and the Wicked

The father is slowly dying and the mother they feel is beginning to lose her mind. It get get worse when something supernatural is going on around here. The main problem with this movie is that while it is suspenseful there's many quiet takes to absorb the atmosphere. However not much really does go on every time something shows up on the screen it just disappears after they turn away from it just happens multiple times throughout the movie to the point where it becomes stale. Set on a farm is good good choice it's secluded, there's not many folks around. Though it doesn't really offer much when you just see this one shack with all these sheep. They could've worked a scene where one of them goes out into the woods nearby to chase after sheep or something like that just. We're just condemned to this farm the whole movie. A fair amount of the opening of the film the brothers just completely oblivious to what's going on. You don't really know much about him or his sister for that matter.

47,TuesdayThe17th,Mixed-ish feelings. Kind of more of a sub plot than an actual story line. But it's still pretty good.,7,17 December 2020,"Bryan Bertino's fourth film in 12 years materializes as a darkly ominous and moody horror offering. While there is plenty of atmospheric dread, the movie feels a bit more like a movie sub plot rather than a fleshed out story. It is not until the final 10 minutes that I sort of saw the story come full circle and began to put away my sub plot accusations. This movie is well done. There are no answers here, but it is still a somewhat scary movie. Its not necessarily the material that is scary but rather the atmosphere through out. The story isn't very good and it is very stretched out feeling. The movie is also a bit boring. There is nothing we haven't seen before here, but that's kind of okay with me because the film is more of an experimental piece than a major attempt to be something it isn't. I appreciate this movie and I like how Bertino added another horror sub genre to his portfolio. No two movies of his are remotely the same. His first was a home invasion film with threats rooted in reality, his second was his hand at the found footage sub genre which was bustling at the time, his third was a creature feature, and now his fourth is a haunted house movie at its core. Great diversity in horror subgenres. This isn't the best of his 4 movies. Its not even the second best in my opinion. Its his third, while ""Mockingbird"" is by far his worst film to date. You can always expect something dark and wicked from Bertino",The Dark and the Wicked

It is interesting, dark, and with suspense from the beginning to the end, but the pace of the plot is very slow without particularly intense horror scenes.

There's a lack of depth and care to the characters that we are supposed to have.From the premise, I expected more, it was just much too gloomy from the get go making everything just kind of ''bleh'', and that went for the scares too.The ending, yeah, felt weak and sloppy and exactly what I wasn't hoping. This kind of ending would fit a short film, not a 2 hour long movie. Disappointing. We also never got more background on why the things are happening, and why the dad was important.

His debut, ""The Strangers,"" was an instant classic introducing masked home invaders in the most unsettling of ways. His followup, ""The Monster,"" was well-crafted as an estranged mother and daughter get stranded in their car in the woods while being stalked by a monster.It was ultimately disappointing as there was nothing to connect the disparate creepy happenings to the story-line.Many movies try to tease the viewer with unreliable narrators, leaving them to ponder whether what is happening is supernatural or all in the characters head. ""The Babadook,"" ""Black Swan,"" and ""The Lighthouse"" are examples of movies that do this right. Unfortunately, this doesn't.It's clearly something supernatural haunting everybody, but beyond some disturbing and/or violent scenes (all of which are well done), the movie is just too ambiguous in a very frustrating way.",The Dark and the Wicked

It's a simple plot but what makes this a true horror is the formless hatred, the forms that evil takes and it's determination to succeed.The house, in its wintery Texas isolation, seems to be in a state of limbo itself, this is a cleverly directed movie that's darkly beautiful.Ignore the quite frankly idiotic and poorly informed reviews.

This poor excuse for a film ripped off Hereditary, Poltergeist 2, The Babadook, and probably some other horror movies.The film had potential to be something cohesive with substance, with character development and something original. But NAH, it had to waste viewers time by trying to create atmosphere then give up on itself by reverting to lame jump scares, done to death clichés and boring long drawn out scenes where the characters mumble like morons, with stifled and contrived dialogue. The guy who played the brother had zero charisma, was a total bore to watch.In several scenes you know what's coming next. We knew the mother was going to chop her fingers off, etc etc.The story, if you can call it that, had no meaning, made no sense. Why does this demon/devil whatever want to possess the fathers dead body? Why not the mother? It has the ability to make people kill themselves anyway, so what's the point? Another thing I can't stand with movies like this is when characters see or witness something creepy and then either don't mention it to the other person, or utter ambiguous diatribe about it. If I saw my dead mother floating outside my bedroom window, and saw her naked coming into the barn towards me, I'd INFORM MY SISTER IMMEDIATELY AND WE WOULD LEAVE WITH DAD!And LOL at the doctor saying you can't take your dad to the hospital, you will kill him.

Its depraved visual style is in your face and really doesn't let up or let pretentious undertones drag it on. While it certainly has horror cliches, they're well presented and never seem cheap.The story is filled with tremendous grief and overbearing family stress and makes the blending of the paranormal horror aspects work that much better. Director Bryan Bertino has always had a keen eye for distinct details in his visual style, and isn't afraid to get vicious at times to compliment the outstanding tension build ups. It amazes me Bertino isn't more recognized because he's a great writer director that deftines you knows horror and atmosphere.Overall this film will be very hard for some to stomach, emotionally and visually, but it's one of the better horror films of the year and maybe last few.

60,BeanieCore,The demon of loneliness waits for you.,8,4 February 2021,"I truly wasn't expecting this little indie film to be one of my favorite horror releases of 2020, but it slowly and surely won me over in the end. Director Bryan Bertino is an unpredictable filmmaker, who has stuck to the horror genre in his work, but whose style and thematical approach is never confined to one kind of horror. He covered home invasion in ""The Strangers"" and monster movies with ""The Monster"", but here he explores supernatural horror. Much like his 2016 film; ""The Monster"", this one also focuses greatly on the emotional and dramatic aspects of it's characters. As much as it's supernatural, it's also a human horror story. Bertino takes cues from the recent trend of slow-burning tension, and using horror as a metaphor for emotion and mental illness. I much prefer these sorts of artful, suspenseful horror films that get under your skin, and inside your head, to disturb you on a psychological level.""The Dark And The Wicked"" namely explores the terror of loneliness. The grief and depression that isolation can inflict upon an individual. It's titular entity seems to feed on the depression and suicidality it instills in it's victims, as it slowly isolates them and convinces them there is no hope. The nameless thing almost seems to be hopelessness incarnate. It causes hallucinations and tricks it's prey into either isolating themselves, or believing they are alone, seemingly the only way it can devour them. Many viewers seem irked by the lack of a name, or face given to it's intangible terror, but this is a film in which one must feel, instead of seeking straight answers. It's easy to see what the entity wants from it's victims, and what it drives them to. We need not know exactly what, or who it is, the horror is in what it wants, and what it does.The direction and cinematography are low-key, atmospheric and tinged with greyish-hues, blanketed by darkness. The film looks, and feels as bleak and melancholy as it's character's mindsets. It builds up slow, subtle horror, before presenting it's viewers with disquieting, uncomfortable visuals and well earned jumps. Even the sound design will have you awaiting the sound of invisible footsteps, creaking floorboards and raspy breaths. It's truly a frightening experience. The acting is good, with purposefully under-stated performances from the small cast. They don't over-act during the more emotional moments, which makes the tour de force ending more effective. There isn't much character development, and though this is easily seen as a stylistic choice, a bit more backstory wouldn't have hurt. Still, we glean enough from conversation to know that this family is estranged, and how they are such perfect prey.This isn't in your face horror. It doesn't have a tight story. It's all about the feeling, the atmosphere, the dread and isolation. It is nothing more than the tale of a demon, a thing, that feeds on the lonely, the hopeless and the ill. There is a lesson, a meaning to be gleaned here. This is horror for those who can appreciate slow burns, psychological scares and strong atmosphere.",The Dark and the Wicked

62,airsnob,"Well... it's a high quality film production, but..",6,30 November 2020,"So good acting, some interesting scenes, some gore, and a general feeling of dread.
As far as plot- two siblings ( maybe half? What was that phone call to the preacher in Chicago about?) come home to take care of their dying dad and sad mom and find their house is possessed by the devil. And that's it.
There is no why, there is no how, there is no resolution. There is no battle of wits or morals or even good and evil. There isn't any reason, or background. You're just thrown into it, just as the characters are.
But this is Hollywood after all. We don't want films that reflect life or reality ; esp when they're about paranormal events.
This I suppose is a realistic take on a family being haunted by a dark and wicked thing.
But as far as entertainment ? As far as a film goes? We want some of that Hollywood flair or else it just falls a bit short - because we have all been programmed to a certain degree to want resolution, to want the why and the mystery solved in a sense.
So when a film gives us none of that ? It just feels shortchanged. Sure we can fill in the blanks.
This could have been a great film. This had all the required ingredients. Of the Highest quality. It just needed a little more flair, a little more story after all-
Sure there is ""art house"" film, that's like a painting on film. They don't usually have a whole lotta story. But beautiful images and messages in those images. This film isn't an art house film. Not by a long shot. There isn't any if at all messages in this film. It's pretty straight out. Nothing to tinker on.
So if you're not an art house film, then you're a story above all else.
And it almost makes me angry when the writers and directors ""forget"" that. Because to me, it kinda feels like a cop out. Like we are unwilling to risk failure so we chop the story- because the story after all, is the hardest part to create.
Most films now are redone, or based on books- because real story's are so hard to tell. To create. To be original.
Any college grad can tell you what a good story needs. And this story is missing some major parts.
And in that way, it fell flat.
I hated the strangers. I feel like I should probably say that. Because there was a whole lotta people who loved The Strangers and thought it was the greatest horror film. I was bored to death in the beginning of it and felt like I was drowning in useless back story, and then the end of the film just confirmed that for me. I'm just not impressed with violence ; any one can do violence. It's sort of like sex. Anyone can do sex. A film weighed down with too much of either isn't going to be good, because it's cheap and we all know it. Both The Strangers and this film are fundamentally, inherently vapid.
I guess I saw what could have been here with just a little more effort, little more creativity, little more story. And over all? It was a let down.",The Dark and the Wicked

66,fairlesssam,Finally something really freakin scary!!,10,27 March 2021,"Wow! This film absolutely floored me. I am an avid horror lover, not much unnerves me. I knew nothing about the plot or storyline before I watched it. Yes, this storyline has been done before, BUT this one did it better than any of its predecessors.A grown up brother and sister meet up at their parents rural goat farm, to help their mother care for their dying father. Their relationship seems strained/distant but they obviously love one another. Small talk is absent, the atmosphere, cripplingly tight with unspoken, pent up feelings, grows into a claustrophobic nightmare.Something is not right, the siblings feel it but cannot pinpoint the source. Their mother is behaving strangely, even though she is under considerable stress with the impending death of her husband, this doesn't seem to be the root cause of her weird demeanour.The cast and crew manage to ramp up the tension to extremes I didn't feel I would have the pleasure of witnessing again. To a horror lover this is pure bliss. I was scared!The characters are likeable, even with their strained and sometimes minimal dialogue the actors portray the siblings fear, confusion and suffering with the force of a mallet! The punches of emotion, fear and trepidation are many as the story unfolds and events progress.This movie left me anxious as hell! Palpitations, a brain full of questions, desperately wishing I could have experienced this at the cinema as it would have completely destroyed me!!I highly recommend going into this film with no expectations and no preconceived ideas. Watch it in the dark, at night and enjoy.",The Dark and the Wicked
67,seveleniumus,Decent atmospheric horror,7,15 December 2020,"It's always refreshing to come upon a horror movie, which relies on it's atmosphere and building tension rather than cheap jump scares.The only thing I didn't like about it, is main characters being very stubborn and very helpless.

68,ryan_sy,Dark and Wicked Indeed!,7,17 November 2020,"What a great film! The story was interesting, the acting believable, the pace was right on, and the scares were well placed. While the plot was nothing original, it was definitely a well made story.The cinematography displayed some real creepy imagery that enriched the overall sense of dread and despair. Imagery that approaches the scare level of the film Hereditary. Truly disturbing stuff.The actors playing the brother and sister did a phenomenal job conveying their grief and fear while dealing with their less than ideal situation.

It is much better than Hereditary and it doesn't descend into a ludicrous ending like Hereditary did. It builds up a good sense of dread and that dread feeds the actual scary scenes. Just as the couple's tension toward each other did in the Strangers the despair and grief felt by the siblings in this one adds to the horror of what is happening around them. It is simply done and really effective. There isn't a lot in the way of over the top, big budget special effects, just a scary, isolated setting, an unsettling dreadful feeling of approaching horror and the grounded realization of two skeptics that something terrible has come for them with no reason or purpose other than ""because it can"". This is one of the rare ones where after I watched late at night and had to take the dog out afterward I felt a sense of unease and of being watched when I was out in the dark night.

The expectation of what'd happen next was also gripping, the nailed the mystery as well. The acting was also really good and the two leads sold the performance of two tortured siblings very well.The biggest problem with the movie as a whole was the lack of proper exposition. Why was the entity haunting them? What was it? Where it came from? Nothing gets answered and the movie just ends on a cliffhanger of sorts without giving you any proper closure. The story could've been fleshed out definitely.

94,ethantoy,Classic Horror in a bottle,8,24 May 2021,"The Dark and The Wicked, was such a welcome surprise and addition to my horror film collection. I loved practically most, if not all of this film. It is a instant classic gem in my eyes, and I truly believe this movie will be recognized as a good horror film in the time to come; it's not necessarily as generic as a typical horror movie can get, but it is as cliche as a horror film gets.With that being said, I will say that this isn't your standard run-of-the-mill horror, that most audiences will see. It's paranormal, and that's as far as it goes within the horror genre. Perhaps it's because I felt that it's been a long time since we've all had a good paranormal horror film, since it's such a redundant and overused sub-genre of horror nowadays. What I feel in essence to the film's identity is its appropriation to distinguish itself as a vastly different horror film from what you know and have seen, it chooses to make decisions that you're not anticipating, and executes them very well.The actors themselves are decent at best, and it seems they're fairly new to the realm of acting. I don't have much complaints with the actors themselves. They're just super fresh, and you can tell by that in the film.The premise of the movie is very reclusive and minimal, it's hard to get a full grasp on what's really occurring in this movie other than what it shows you- I'd say it's self-explanatory, but the movie takes some twists and turns that really can be head scratching to say the least.Effects are great! Most of the film uses practical effects and it still looks as amazing as it would've back in the day. I think it's pretty uncommon nowadays to see practical effects used. But it works elegantly with this movie.All in all, I'd say The Dark and The Wicked is a truly mesmerizing horror movie with a dark theme, a huge set of lore behind it, and it will develop a following overtime. It holds a lot of secrets that the director wants you to conceptualize yourself and mark as your own understanding. Majority of people will not see this eye-to-eye, as most audiences like to be given this information off the bat (spoon-fed to say the least) and that's just the way films like this go. Indie horror has come a long way, and The Dark and The Wicked is an excellent contender in this category. You can't go wrong with a classic, 90-minute runtime of a horror movie that has uniqueness to its name. It's a great movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants some new horror in their free time. It's a classic!",The Dark and the Wicked

103,ReaLMoisan,No Coherent World Building,4,16 November 2020,"This movie has all the elements for a great horror film, except for a plot with logical and consistent world building.So the devil is after the fathers soul, and slowly kills him after years of ailing from some degenerative condition. So far, so good. You have an evil entity that slowly drains the life from someone to get their soul. But here's the issue; this same entity kills everyone else with ease.The devil kills Louise, Micheal, the mother, the nurse, the priest, and rips apart dozens of sheep too. So this devil can kill, but it takes years to kill the father, ...for reasons. It also haunts the mother for years too, yet Louise and Micheal for only a week. Why? It's never explained or even hinted at.This is an issue with many horror movies, especially ones with a supernatural element. Why does the evil antagonist toy with the characters, when the desired goal is their death, and this can be accomplished with ease. Some movies explain why: like feeding on fear to gain power, or fear makes victims taste better when consumed, or needing time to manipulate characters to release or summon them, or one of dozens of other explanations within the genre. This movie does none of that.The audience needs to know the rules in a horror film, that's what creates the tension and anxiety. Rules let the audience know what's possible and what's at stake. If anything is seemingly possible, like an unstoppable devil that can kill anyone with impudence, then what are the stakes. It's an unfathomable force that kills half a dozen other characters at a whim, yet takes years to drain one man. There's no rules and no motivation given.If you edited this movie to just have the ""scary"" scenes left, nothing would be lost. Realistically, you wouldn't even miss out on any real plot or context either. No motivations, no stakes, no rules, no plot: just scary things happen for unexplained reasons, the end.",The Dark and the Wicked

It plays out well through symbolism, which is great, but it lacks story details, which to me turns out to be it's main drawback.

109,peeps_ahoy,Atmospheric but not coherent or that horrific,6,4 March 2021,"This has an extremely promising premise and the first act is quite good. However, as things build, more and more questions arise which are never answered, and it is not as scary as reviews here depict. In the end, it's all up to interpretation and the ending itself is extremely abrupt and unsatisfying. This is by the same guy who made The Strangers, and it kind of shows, though The Strangers was better for exploring the random evil in human nature. This is just ""here's random evil from.. the devil!"" There are a lot of very predictable jumpscares, which are unfortunate since I feel it clashes with the solemn and grim atmosphere. There are some creepy-in-the-background things, and one scene in particular, that actually achieve a horror effect without being signaled beforehand.In the end, I thought a lot of ""The Lodge"" in its similarity of cabin setting and feeling of grim isolation as things go weird and tragic, but The Lodge is a farrrrrr superior film and has a different route in its plot.It's worth a watch, but I would not watch it again. If it wasn't for all the unsatisfactory loose ends up for interpretation, I wouldn't be thinking about it still. I'm sure that's the intention, but I feel it's a bit cheap. (No I don't want to be spoonfed answers, I just want to feel invested in a movie.)Most importantly, the movie does not have the scares people claim it does. There are a few scenes that are scary, but only one will stick with me, and it's the one that was actually a surprise (if you watch it, you'll know the one). Everything else is basically generic suspense>fake out scare>suspense>jumpscare kind of formula, which is not fun to sit through for me, and I found myself wincing and waiting for the oncoming jumpscare and wanting the scene to end already. Jumpscares are cheap.I almost gave this a 7/10 but decided that was probably too high for how I feel. I wanted to like this. It had good elements. If you have time to burn, it's not the worst option. Just wasn't to my taste in the majority of regards.",The Dark and the Wicked
110,med-01081,The dull start the wicked middle and the dreary end,5,13 November 2020,Gave this one a go as the trailer looked decent for a friday night horror so i never go in expecting much from these shudder horrors as the trailers tend to be better than the movie itself. Starts off slow with minor character development over a long period with nice shots of the farm scenery that the story is based around. The family story and background wasnt very engaging and deep enough and i struggled to understand some of the muffled talking from the actors. When we finally get to some horror and jump scare parts its actually good and starts going somewhere so you strap yourself in for ride that never quite climaxes. This had a lot of potential as the location could have done a lot more for the product. A creepy farm with antlers everywhere and a haunting entity that is relentless could have been pushed a bit further. By the end i was left disappointed by the over the top predictability of the plot. The acting was ok at best and the highlights come from the priest and the mother. A missed opportunity for a devilish farm movie but still worth a one time watch if you like anything horror related.,The Dark and the Wicked

The Dark and the Wicked is such a film.The slow burn pacing of the movie is exquisite. This is a character and story driven production that doesn't rush to its conclusion, providing edge-of-your-seat moments and hold-your-breath anticipation in resolving certain scenes.and wondering what comes next. Kudos to a fine acting ensemble that stays on point and doesn't ham it up.The themes are old, but have the viewer thinking about religion, the devil, biblical dogma and redemption in a different way. The isolation.of the ranch spawns a type of claustrophobia, as does the potential of dying alone. In this way, it touches the unease we all have about ""the end"" and what to expect when it comes.Young people will probably not appreciate this film, as it doesn't present the internet pace of modern life or the modern horror movies that are.analogous to it.",The Dark and the Wicked

119,SJinSeaTac,Stick to producing,1,22 March 2021,"Bryan Bertino started his career with a small film called the Strangers. With a modest budget, the film was a huge financial success for Universal. Since then he has pulled away from the director's chair, choosing to write and produce content instead of directing. In the wake of the Strangers release, many wondered why with such a huge success would Bertino stop directing. Well, I think this film shows pretty clearly why that is the case. Without a major studio to rein him in, Bertino has little to no command of his own material, relying on several ""made you look"" death scenes to convey the cruelty of his narrative structure. This is not new territory to horror, and Bertino wastes Marin Ireland in a lead role (which she elevates above and beyond the material on the page), meandering around, creating atmosphere over plot, resulting in a tired, boring, run of the mill art film with nothing surprising up its sleeve, and nothing to say about the family dynamics of the characters that it purports to know so well about.

The visuals are solid and the audio score works as well. Acting job also hits its mark. The horror in this movie is a mix of jump scares combined with more lingering imaginary of unexplained phenomenon. The problem however, is that it all gets a bit dull until the end, as all the horror elements pretty much stays the same throughout the runtime. Even though the film can be categorized as a slow-burner, it ain't exactly holding back with its delivery of spooks either. This means that all the scary stuff starts to feel a bit diluted. I kept on expecting some fresh elements and alterations of course, but sadly there wasn't any.

Won't say anything else but what follows is a slow build up to an intense series of days in which the brothers beliefs and sanity will be tested. Slow doesn't mean boring, all scenes are relevant to the story and to me, the climax was tense and very efficient.At first I thought this would be a typical haunted house flick, but it avoids religious pandering and kept me glued to the chair, there are many truly creepy moments, strong recommend to any fans of the genre.",The Dark and the Wicked

The gore wasn't over the type, but used sparingly in the right places. I think my only complaint is the ending seemed really rushed.

Great super scary horror about the devil trying to steal souls by using sight and sound to tempt you to darkness.I am giving it a 9 instead of an 8 like I should be. However if I don't give it one higher than I want to rate it, it will likely place lower than it should do the extreme reviewers that give 1's if they don't like a movie.

133,chrisgilmer,"Okay, not many reviews on this one yet, so here's my take...",8,7 November 2020,"Acting: actually very, very good.
Cinematography: again, A+.
Special effects: that all depends on your taste of blood and gore. Personally, I thought it had some gruesome parts, but not over the top.
Here's why I only rated it an 8 out of 10: scare factor. In the beginning of the movie, the mystery of the entity is definitely malevolent and seems to enjoy taking its time before a kill. Cool concept.
But as the movie moves along, the scares become more predictable and the main characters, as seemingly level headed as they are, don't act rationally, in my opinion, and then the movie becomes a house of cards at the end and collapses without a proper ending.
I'm trying not to give too much away because I don't want you to think it's a bad movie. Just could have been better, and that was disappointing. I would, however, recommend it as there are not many options for good movies period right now. Compared to some of the other junk I've had to endure lately, this is like the Hope Diamond.",The Dark and the Wicked
134,rageinblack,This is a pretty awful horror movie,5,3 December 2020,"I'm not gonna lie, this horror movie was pretty awful. It is boringly slow and features a lot of snoozing silent scenes that are soon broken up by loud screams, to wake you up from snoozing, and even louder telephone with the most annoying ringing that no one ever answers. So typical from horror directors they literally enjoy torturing your ears, it's obvious at this point.But not only that, the story itself that is just ugly, and also kinda artsy-fartsy and cheap. Cheap, in the sense that there has just not been put much effort to make the movie somehow meaningful and, god forbid, entertaining. Everything is just so easily solved with some demonic hallucinations that come out of nowhere and this happens all the time. It's a movie that makes you feel bad, almost insulted, like the director is toying with your attention and perception all the time. It's not even entertaining, because inevitably you will start hating him.I don't know why anyone would enjoy watching such a movie. It's an ugly story with an ugly rural and dark setting full of depression and desperation. It also features that, now cliche, annoying ugly woman with her crying face on all the time, that makes it so much harder to watch. Kinda like The Babadook, but overall, also very strongly reminecent of movies like the VVitch and Hereditary.However the quality of the movie is good, the actors are decent, the camera work is interesting, and the movie is definitely trying hard to be serious, so props to that.But did I actually enjoy the movie?

There are dark and wicked things in this world for whom death, suffering, manipulation and torture is pleasure. The director relies on this foundation to deliver an atmospheric and emotional horror movie. The jump scares are scarce yet there is all pervading menace and terror in every frame. Each movement of shadow is harbinger of fear. Never have the howls of wolves inspired such dread and anticipation.As far as story is concerned it moves within the narrow confines of its characters. The characters themselves are limited: basically on a need to know basis. Where the movie scores is the interplay between the characters. The vulnerabilities of characters are exploited and they are manipulated.The acting is very good by all. The cinematography and sound is exceptional. The direction is excellent. The director builds up an atmosphere that is claustrophobic and drips with helplessness.

149,MelliDan,A mixed bag (rating: 5.5),6,20 March 2021,"Director Bryan Bertino (The Strangers, The Monster) certainly understands the importance of creating a dark, brooding atmosphere in horror cinema. It's a huge contribution to the art of terror. That's the strongest trait that The Dark and the Wicked has going for it - the old, dark house and surrounding family farm with shadows lurking around every corner.The film starts out promising, considering the setting I mentioned, combined with a set of offbeat but fairly interesting characters which comprise this strange family dynamic. The brother and sister are in the position of parenting their parents, really, as the father is terminally ill and the mother is emotionally unstable. So, the setup is very decent, and we as the viewer know there is a looming danger in the house, however it's not revealed right away.As the film goes on, there become too many jump scares to keep up with. Which is a shame, because there are actually a lot of scenes with high tension to begin with, but for me, it doesn't pay off because the scares become too formulaic and predictable. All in all, this is a film revolving around the paranormal that doesn't really ever reach its full potential, as the elements of horror have all been explored before, and better. If you like slow-burn psychological horror, I'd say you can expect that in the first quarter of the film, but the rest of it just doesn't carry that same momentum.",The Dark and the Wicked

The biggest problem; the movie is too vague and because of that the pieces don't really come together in the end.

Nope, the film just...stops.Quick breakdown of the story: Siblings Louise & Michael come home to help out their mom on the goat farm when their father becomes deathly ill. Spookie things begin to happen. People died who ain't the father. And then it ends.Positives, i got some positives for the film. Overall the production side (lighting, camera work, etc) is really good. Bryan Bertino and his team really built this haunting atmosphere that grips you from the beginning and holds on without letting up. There are several scenes throughout the film that are effective in scaring the audience without a jump scare. Marin Ireland (Louise) 's performance was really good. She felt natural for the role and gave a hell of a performance. Also gotta give it up for my man Michael Zagst who was able to act like a man asleep on a bed for a majority of the film.Negatives, some hard negatives. The story isn't great. It's basically Bryan Bertino's earlier film ""The Strangers"" but with a demon. I've seen people compare this film to ""Hereditary"" which is asinine. I hoped that the film would reward the audience for paying attention to backgrounds, props, just anything so that you get environmental storytelling about why this is happening, like ""Hereditary."" But it doesn't. To be fair, there is some environmental storytelling but it is mainly for characterization that doesn't explain why this spooky dooky stuff is happening.The demon power is also confusing and nonsensical. Sometimes it just wants to move chairs around and grunt over the sleeping husby. Sometimes it wants the characters to hurt themselves and then kill themselves. It goes after anyone and everyone, which reminds me of the ghosts from Ju-on. But is this a curse brought on to the dad? Is it a curse brought on to the family because of the dad? Why is this happening to the family to begin with? You don't know why, and apparently that's the point. Bad things happen without reason and you have to deal. What a load of b.s. You can have a nihilistic film but still have a cause and effect to show the audience why this is happening to the main characters. Look at ""No Country for Old Men,"" the main character takes money from a cartel shootout and now the devil comes to collect his dues.What's bad is that there is a legitimate good story somewhere in this mess but the director is too pretentious to even put in effort.I could say more but this is already 494 words long. There's good things about this film that would work great if another director were to use them, but with a disappointing story that leaves you wanting, I can't recommend this movie unless it's free or you're bored.",The Dark and the Wicked

It was just nothing but these little shock moments followed by slow, boring storyline that didn't even really make sense or even really matter. It just kept dragging on and on and the same things kept happening over and over again. The ending was absolutely a slap in the face.

You can tell immediately that the film is about a wife taking care of her dying husband when their children come to visit as his end is obviously near. What happens after that is some of the best horror I've seen in a long time.

There are a few jump scares, but the building of tension is the main source of the scare factor. I wasn't a fan of the ending but to each their own. The film certainly wasn't done a disservice by the ending, just not my cup of tea.

Don't expect a standard, linear plot with lots of dumbed down exposition - this film just 'is' brutal, unrelenting and really gets under your skin.The cinematography is beautiful and the actors all deliver above average performances but the real star of the show is the audio. The sound design elevates the film significantly, to the point where you probably won't get anything like the full effect if listening via TV speakers (or worse). There's a lot of very quiet detail going on in the sound mix that I fear some viewers will miss out on completely.Only minor fault I can think of is some less than realistic CGI in goats/field scene.Other than that, It sets you on edge from about five minutes in and doesn't really let up at all.

There's not much in the way of a back story, but you figure it out as it unfolds. Unlike many modern slow burn arthouse horror (Hereditary, The VVitch, etc) this is a slow burn that's never boring. The score is a tense masterpiece, and the acting is superior to anything in any other horror film of the last 10 years.

In scene after scene, the viewer is multiple steps ahead of the characters, what accounts for a plot, and where the bogeyman is hiding.

176,artistwriter-54705,Sometimes It's Simply Better To Stay Away.,8,29 January 2021,"I am going to do my best to write a spoiler free review, and please bear with me as this was one of the best horror films I have seen in about the last 3 to 5 years.Let me start off by saying earlier today I bought a smart watch with a health tracker that I synched up to my tablet and during the span of watching that movie, my pulse rate went berserk numerous times. While this may not be much of a testament to either my health or the watch, I can tell you that this movie does have its share of very scary and a lot of WTF moments.There are a couple of tropes that I am very very tired of seeing and having grown up on a farm there were some things conspicuously missing from this movie. While those things had they been in the film would have simply added more tropes, their absence made the movie all that much more terrifying as those missing things give you a real sense of what is happening.A brother and sister show up at the mom's house with their ailing father at death's door, and out of the gate some truly weird things start to happen, even before the kids arrive. As the movie progresses through its story, you have absolutely no idea where it is going and by the time you get to the end, you've just got more questions in your mind.The tropes that I mention were a detractor, however the biggest detractor were two actors who chewed the scenery and a third actress who really didn't have much of a reason to be there other than for some kind of shock value. When you see the movie you'll know better what I mean.There is a story, and a few threads that are thrown out there that make you wonder what in the hell is really going on, and what is the worst part about those threads is that while they have no real rhyme or reason, they fit together to form the true nature of creeping evil there is.Again, you have to see the film to know what I mean. I have given this movie 8 stars because 7.5 isn't really possible with the rating system on this page. What I can tell you is that it is a good film well acted, and well crafted. The problems for me were very very small, and while we have all seen the obligatory remote farm house supernatural film, this one left me with a lot of questions unanswered and that is what the true nature of horror is.Horror isn't seeing a dead body or a bloody axe, it's lingering questions and wondering what really happened, and if it's actually worse than one can imagine.This movie actually scared me for a lot of reasons other than the obvious because I have seen some things and have lived a life that has taken me some places that I never thought I would be. That said, for those who are over 40, this movie might hit close to home, and for those who have dealt with ailing parents, this might not be the movie for you.All of that aside, it is a fantastic horror film and I honestly think any negative reviews are by people who probably haven't lived long enough to know what real fear is.",The Dark and the Wicked
177,Plasticbender,"Not a bad movie, watchable",6,14 January 2021,"This is not a good movie, at the same time not bad at all. It is a small budget haunted house indie movie. Atmosphere, acting, slow burning makes this movie watchable. Bad things are characterization, story plot, and some cheap jump scares. The movie starts very good, as it continues, nothing new, it is repetitive and falls flat. Many of reviewers who rated this high are comparing and praising this movie with hereditary, which is insane. This movie doesn't have that much newness in it.",The Dark and the Wicked
178,suzasailor,The Ultimate review to The Dark and The Wicked,6,2 March 2021,"This movie seems to have most of the internet divided. Some same its a horror masterpiece and others calling it dull spook fodder. I think they are both right.The plot if you don't know. Two sibblings visit their parents after their father seems to be in coma bed redden state. Its not explained if its a terminal disease or what. Afterwards the spooks begin to happen.I will say this movie is excellently shot and the music is low key perfect for this story. There is a overall eerie sense of dread to the whole movie. Everyone looks like they're at their wits end and tired of life. I belive this helps and hurt the movie in some ways. It does set a mood but it depends if thats what kind of mood you wanna be in.There is ambiguity a foot in much of the run time. You wont know why are how much is happening. This is fine for some but may annoy others. The acting is overall pretty strong. But the writting is questionable in some places, especially towards the end.Overall this is a very depressing movie with some much over used of jump scares. That might be enough for some. Like I said it is well acted and looks great and above average sound design and score.But at the end of the day, can I recommend this?
Its tough, there is talent behind it, but overall a hollow emptiness you feel after watching it. If you want to have a feeling of sense of dread and not mind a slow burning film, I say its for you.
But if you want something like a entertaining horror masterpiece?This aint it.Its a pretty and dark but flawed film that doesn't find its footing and can't stand on its own from all its unnecessary ambiguous horror tropes.6/10 worth one watch but its hard to see myself coming back to it.So overall its not a masterpiece and its not a trainwreck. Its a little disappointing because you feel it truly could have been great. But it does have some merits worth watching.",The Dark and the Wicked

It had some horror movie tropes in it, but they were done so well that I looked past the more predictable moments. I really appreciated the background details that were there like quick glimpses of the demon and shadows, they added to the dread and creepiness factor of the movie for sure. The score was great also, the tension it builds throughout the movie kept me on the edge of my seat despite this being more of a slow burn film. The special effects and cinematography are done so well and look spectacular. The acting is stellar and creepy. I see people complaining about the lack of story and reasoning behind whats happening, but its not about that, at least not the way I see it. It's more about the dread and unnerving reality that sometimes, bad things happen to good people for no reason at all, which makes it all the more frightening. Overall great movie and I definitely recommend it.",The Dark and the Wicked

Its like a movie that wants to scare you and it does but there is absolutely no reason or logic why things are happening the way it is.The two siblings start acting and doing stupid things and then the last 5 second was even as bizarre as it gets.At least throw in a history of the farm or the father's past to let us know why events unfolded as it did. Sorry but 1 star out of 10 for story. For scares it is a 8 out of 10.

I won't spoil anything from there, but they soon start to realize that something isn't right with their farm.I enjoyed writer/director Bryan Bertino's previous film, The Strangers, and like that movie he uses the eeriness of the farm settling to build atmosphere and tension. And just like The Strangers, this film also features unwanted visitors, but just in a different way.It has a lot of quieter moments to build tension and it does payoff when some of the scares come into play.

Clearly it's a possession type of movie, but how they play out the plot is really unique and suspenseful.

Presentation over substance. It's shot well, acted well, but a STORY would help a great deal so that we too can care about the characters as much as the characters are presented to care for each other.
The main characters, a farming brother and sister with a bedridden father and a mother who may have dementia, encounter terrifying events, each one worse than the next, and each one presented as a warning to LEAVE, GO, GET OUT, etc., similar to the original Amityville when the house itself demands that the family GET OUT.
But, as always, and why it's so hard to find great, original horror, if the characters made wise decisions the movie would be over in ten minutes.
If you're one to get annoyed by characters who seem to ask for it or who can't make one logical or rational decision because that wouldn't serve the plot, skip this.

People pan the movie because of its lack of resolution but I think that the only thing that causes this movie to ever so slightly miss the mark is because we are not given any backstory as to how any of this started and how the mother knew what she knew. I think if these areas were a little more flushed out, I think the story would have had a more satisfying (even though open) conclusion.

There are no stakes, no way to win. You are just watching people getting the worst possible hallucinations they can until they lose it.
First half was decent, the usual creepy noises and shadowy figures, and then it never progresses, it just goes on until everyone is dead.
What am I supposed to be invested in? What should I be rooting for? It's not that characters try to fight the evil but fail, they don't even try, hell they don't even DO anything other than get abused by that evil thing.
Acting was good, camera was good, sound was great, just no script. Watch it if you like seeing people being miserable, other than that, it's a waste of time.",The Dark and the Wicked

If you're gonna make a movie with next to no dialogue or audible story, you better make it visually engaging and telling a story through cues - like Aster or Van Trier do so well (or hell, Oz Perkins).

City of the Living Dead, Zombie, House by the Cemetery, Beyond and the Sentinel (1977) are some of my favorites. I like most any Horror before 1989 as long as it is decent.

225,lotfeeat,Excellent horror movie,8,8 December 2020,"I think The Dark and the Wicked is an excellent horror movie in spite of the story of the movie isn't new to me as a viewer.
I think the movie is not just an evil spirit in a haunted house that kills people, it is also a psychological movie and I disagree with the people who say the movie is meaningless, I think it is suitable for fans of psychological horror as well as fans of paranormal horror.
There are some interesting points in the movie that make me see it as a psychological horror movie such as :
All deaths that happen in the movie are suicides, the devil's origin is never mentioned, and a reason for its appearance is never given besides, that the movie focus on the relationship and emotions between parents and children, Louise and Michael feels guilty of leaving their mother to look after their father on her own. That leads me to ask are the visions real?points I liked in the movie : the atmosphere of the movie is creepy, cinematography and colors are excellent and very good acting.",The Dark and the Wicked

This movie is nowhere nearly as creepy/unsettling and there's basically no storyline. It maybe could have saved itself by having a twisted ending but instead, the end scene sucked even more that I could have imagined.
I enjoy GOOD slow burner horrors/thrillers, but this was just slow without any reward. Do not spend money on this.",The Dark and the Wicked
229,charlie_red,Ignore all the poor reviews-this is terrifying!!,10,8 March 2021,"I don't understand why people mark down horror films that don't give a background story. Why do we as viewers need to know everything? It adds mystery and adds to the scare factor. We don't know what they did (if anything) to attract this evil, which leaves you feeling it could happen to anyone, and definitely leaves you looking over your shoulder.
I'm not a lover of overdone CGI effects. This uses simplicity and slow creeping terror to chill you to the very bone.
If you liked the fear that Hereditary roused in you, but like me thought the ending was way too OTT and became silly, then this film is for you.

232,joeyyyvela,Extremely Disappointing,3,29 December 2020,"I'll preface this by saying that I enjoyed Bryan Bertino's debut, the Strangers, and I've now seen three of his four films (the Monster being the only one I haven't checked out). This movie is basically the Strangers all over again, but instead of a man and a woman being terrorized by masked strangers in a home invasion movie, it's a man and a woman being terrorized by the devil in a haunted house movie. You have the setting of a lone, isolated house. You have the complete lack of a cohesive plot. There's jump scares and other clichés. The cinematography and shot composition are identical, and you also have a similar bleak tone.But the big difference is that the Strangers was a simple and effective home invasion movie, and it knew what it wanted to be. It wasn't a confusing, jumbled mess that brought forward a million questions and answered none of them. It's clear that Bryan Bertino isn't interested in storytelling or having a fleshed out plot. He wants to create a dense atmosphere and suspenseful set pieces. The only issue is that you can't make what is essentially the same movie again, using the same bag of tricks, and expect to invoke the same emotional response (except for the record player playing country music during a suspenseful scene, I dig that). And outside of that bag of tricks, there just isn't anything that this movie offers.Sure, there's some subtext you can attempt to read into, about how the entity is maybe an allegory for people not being able to accept the loss of a loved one, and wanting to pin the blame on something supernatural and out of their hands. Or about how religion is an unreliable outlet to find comfort or answers about death. And while I like these themes, the problem is that they aren't actually explored in the movie, and they don't add anything of substance to it.Plot-wise, the movie is just a mess. There are things introduced that you think are going to be important plot points, but they aren't. They're just random things that are never brought up again. The biggest offender, without spoiling what happens, is a scene where the main character talks to Xander Berkeley over the phone and he says something genuinely interesting, and you think it's leading to a twist, but it never comes up again. On the subject of characters, Xander Berkeley is completely wasted in this movie. He just shows up out of nowhere and he serves no purpose in the story, and then he goes away. There's also just no reason we're given to care about these characters. Things start happening immediately and nothing gets developed with them. The characters don't really do anything, and they don't learn anything. They just stumble around confused for the entire runtime, and then the movie just ends on a jump scare. No closure. No payoff. Was that intentional? Was that intended to be a message about the mysterious, inevitable nature of death? I don't know, it's more likely that I'm just putting in more effort than the movie did. And even if it was intended, it's still just incredibly unsatisfying and anticlimactic.There are some things to like about it, and it's okay if you enjoyed it. I'm glad you did. But I can't believe some people are looking at this movie as if it's some kind of deep, profound art film. It's painfully textbook, and there's nothing innovative or exceptional about it. Not with the story, the cinematography/presentation, the structure, nothing. If you want a good, recent, ""arthouse,"" horror movie, I'd recommend the new Suspiria, Midsommar, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, Mandy, Climax, and the Lighthouse (as just a few). If you just want a good haunted house movie, His House is another one that came out this year and is better in every way. It's also free to watch on Netflix. There's also We Are Still Here, which is free on Prime Video. Just watch one of those instead.
tl;dr:
+ It looks fine; the cinematography isn't bad
+ The music creates some nice ambience at times
+ Decent atmosphere, I guess
+ One or two pretty good scenes

I watched this in the middle of the day, but that didn't stop the fear from completely taking over my body and soul. Sounds dramatic, maybe cause I was hungover and feeling extra sensitive, but my god, I was so disturbed and upset. Honestly, I cried a little after because I felt so traumatized and afraid that I wasn't going to be able to feel joy again? LolThe acting really took me for the ride and was the reason why I was so afraid. The characters were so helpless, inconsolable, and exhausted because of their fear, and therefore I was as well.

Theres some really creepy parts to this movie and the music keeps you on edge, the acting is brilliant and you really feel for the characters. One of the creepiest movies up to date and it takes alot to freak me out!! It's no hereditary tho as hereditary is the best horror of this generation in my opinion. The reason I gave this 6 stars is there is a few moments where I thought there could've been improvements and the ending could've been better. Abit of history into the characters maybe!!!

Hunting phenomenons are emblematic of this conundrum and this movie encapsulates that fact and enhances the erieness, heightens the senses as we try desperately to make perfect sense of the senseless. Some of these reviews harp on the notion that every film is suppose to follow a nice and tidy storyline, something they can easily process, but this particular subject is full of shadows.

Why kill yourself if nothing matters anymore. Aren't you just playing into pure evils hand??Quality of the film, acting, effects and otherwise are completely on par.

268,utdrew,Flawless until the ending,8,27 December 2020,"Spoilers will be clearly marked at the end of this review.I absolutely love slow burning atmospheric horror, and this is quite a masterpiece in the genre. The acting, direction, and score are all excellent. The mood and tension are, in a word, flawless. The story is a bit bare bones, but that doesn't bother me in a horror film at all.This is one of the most relentlessly bleak, nihilistic, and downright sinister films I've ever seen.Many reviewers have criticized the absence of a backstory or explanation for why the events of the film happen. As with The Strangers (""because you were home""), I find the absence of any real reason for why the victims of the evil deeds were chosen greatly enhances the unsettling nature of the story. Isn't it more terrifying to feel that you could be next and there are no rules to follow to avoid that fate? This is also consistent with the nihilism of this film.As great as the movie was, it ends with a thud in my opinion. The climax as a whole is pretty good; it was merely the very last scene that left me cold. There were so many great ways to end it, and Bertino chose very poorly here. However, it wasn't so bad as to ruin what was otherwise a fantasticly dreadful (in a good way) movie experience. Some horrible endings, especially twisty ones, absolutely can manage that, such as the all too common iT wuZ alL a DrEaM ending.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSI've seen one reviewer complain that the film has no internal logic in that the father is possessed very slowly over the course of the film while several characters around him are possessed with ease. I have no problem with this at all. First of all, it's pretty clear that the entity is pure evil, and as such is concerned with nothing other than inflicting not only physical pain, but also profound amounts of all the worst kinds of emotional pain: namely terror, horror, despair, grief, anxiety, and disgust. The way the story unfolds here, it seems to me, is among the best ways to inflict that pain on the maximum number of people in the father's orbit.",The Dark and the Wicked
269,sugianes,Where's the story?,1,22 February 2021,"So many plot holes in this movie:
1. Why the devil doing this? As if they (the mom and dad) were making some kind of pact with the devil and now is the due for the devil to claim their souls or whatsoever.2. What's whit the ""priest""??? Why and what's the point introducing him into the movie? He talked about helping the mom blahblahblah and suddenly he just an apparition of the devil? Come on it's so lame!3. Why Charlie had to call their house at 3 a.m? Why Charlie wear a tie and in such a formal attire while in his own house at 3 a.m? Why there is an apparition of Louse haunting Charlie and said ""you did this to me blahblahblah"", why?? Another pointless scene? Come on this movie so stupid and it makes my goddamn head ache!Like I asked on the title, where's the story?? Here let me fix this movie for you and make this movie watchable, first, the mother and father did some pact with the devil, and now it's the time for the devil to claims what is his, the priest is trying to help the mother but then he failed, its revealed then that the father and Charlie did something terrible in the past, maybe some kind of abusive relationships with his own daughter (Louise) for offering to the devil (explains why Charlie felt guilty about that and ended killed himself!), that's what you need! The twist! The EXPLANATION! This movie is empty, 1 out of 10 is generous enough tho",The Dark and the Wicked

some really good scary moments, stuff that you will rememberacting is good, not really anyone i recognized but they did wellscenery was greatagain, i have to mention the scary parts one more time, some of them were REALLY good, for this reason alone its worth watchinggreat mind bending scenes that will mess with your headgood buildupCons:
a few moments that were meant to be scary, were not scary at all (the beginning)felt like they were trying too hard at timesthe title of the movie, i don't get it, doesn't seem to correlate with the movie that wellmy biggest issue with the movie: there is no backstory as to why this farm/home is being haunted. there is a brief scene with a priest that talks to the kids and provides a little information but its very vague. what or who exactly is haunting them? when did it start? where did it come from? WHY is it haunting them? some of you may say the priest explains this but its just not fulfilling enough at all. how do we know that the family didn't deserve it? what if they were horrible people? why would some farm out in the middle of nowhere get haunted? if they took an extra 10-15 mins in the movie to talk about or show some of this, this movie would earn another 2 stars from me.",The Dark and the Wicked

278,wraithchan,"Bad ending, but good atmosphere",2,3 December 2020,"I am so thoroughly disappointed in how the movie ended. The atmosphere and the feeling was there, but the ending was just too unrewarding that I hate myself for spending my time watching this.",The Dark and the Wicked

280,anshulsharma-70972,"Thumbs up for the story, acting and scares - My review",9,13 December 2020,"The film has an engaging story with top-class acting. It straightaway gets to the point and doesn't waste any time. We are introduced to the devil entity and the story around it in the first 10 minutes. Bryan Bertino certainly knows how to develop tension and fear among his viewers - something he did in The Strangers (2008). Marin Ireland and Michael Abbott Jr. are able to convince us about the fear lurking in the house. The music by Tom Schraeder instills chills along with Bertino's direction.
Everything about the film just feels right. Pacing and run-time of the film are apt, given the story. If the pace had been any more slower or faster, it would defeat the purpose of the story. The scares work in favor of the film. Even the ringing telephone or knock on the door knows its purpose. The film has no hero or change-of-heart type character. This is a good cold-night-lights-off watch.",The Dark and the Wicked

It is so dark and relatable. The acting is excellent, not just Marin (Louise) but all of the actors. Jump scare movies are fun and all but dark, terrifying movies that seep deep into you're psyche and make you hope you're good with the man upstairs, now that's something else all together. It just goes to show how true directing artistic talent doesn't need special effects or big box office names.",The Dark and the Wicked
283,jmbrown-66225,Rated a 7 but very well done fun,7,8 February 2021,"So here's my thoughts on the dark and the wicked.. the name fits.. I enjoyed it though I get why some people dislike because it moves ""slower""... I definitely would suggest if your in the mood for a horror movie that actually tells a story rather than being in the mood for nonstop scares but this movie still delivers plenty of scares... I'm personally glad to have added this to my horror collection... I'm gonna give it a strong 7 rating but very well done",The Dark and the Wicked

285,ledmfaria,Poor movie,2,7 February 2021,"The film appears to be one of those that brings out all the characteristics of a good horror film. But, unfortunately, it only gets small, bouncing, very small moments of terror. The plot is very weak, it misses at different times, bringing practically no linearity or even logic. The end is simply a failure.",The Dark and the Wicked
286,lucasadand,You can so much better with 90 minutes,1,28 February 2021,"90 minutes might not seem like a long time, but when the credits roll on this movie, you suddenly realize all the things you could have done with that time that would have been better. This movie has some good performances, and it looks good, but those are the only positive things I can offer. There is no real plot, no real substance, nothing to invest yourself in here... this movie is like an old pickup truck that is fully restored cosmetically but has no engine. It's pointless. This movie is a meeting that could have been an email. I feel like I would be doing you a favor by spoiling the ending, but there is no real ending to spoil. This movie caused me to cancel my Shudder subscription. I'm currently seeking legal counsel to demand compensation from all parties involved in the creation, production and distribution of this film. Please find a more productive and enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes of your time. Arrange your shoes alphabetically. Try to convince a stranger that you're Emmanuel Macron. Try teaching yourself telekinesis. Anything is better than watching this movie.",The Dark and the Wicked
287,spiroschuring,Overused movie tropes that don't serve the story combined with a cheap story,3,4 May 2021,"I see many good reviews for this movie and I have to say...I SURE WONDER WHO THE H*LL PAID THEM OFF TO WRITE SUCH A POSITIVE REVIEW. The movie is full of edgy over used horror movie tropes, a spider, the walking corpse, white eyes, the random phone ringing, the nightmare, the random deep voice coming from a female, the shadows making funny movements and most of all edgy suicides with dull objects that hardly enforce the story. It's just a cheap shot at making you feel quite nasty. If this movie was a dish and the nasty things where mayonaise, the movie would be a plain slice of white bread covered in mayonaise. It's the ultimate version of the ""everyone died, THE END"" type of stories a kindergartner would think of. It just takes all the most effective elements of the classics and blends them together and pours it in a bowl of cheap story as an excuse to hit you with contextless cheap thrills. Sorry, but this wasn't it for me.",The Dark and the Wicked

290,Jimsalabim83,creepy atmosphere but lack of story,5,27 November 2020,It starts out pretty creepy and there is one good scare effect. Overall the atmosphere was pretty dark so points for that. The problem was mostly the lack of a good immersive story to pull you in. Actors were not that great either but not that bad for a horror movie. Also the christian woman who pierced her eyes has her eyes still intact in the next scene (what a shame). all in all it's worth a watch but don't expect a great story.,The Dark and the Wicked

The writer and director should never write and direct anything again! The writing is terrible the screenplay makes no sense at all, the dialogs are awful with no meaning the acting is so so considering the bad writing. The movie is not scary at all, it was a boring senseless torture of the mind that I was waiting to be over. How it got 6 rating is beyond me.",The Dark and the Wicked

Well, this movie has a new dark and creepy guy, The priest played by Xander Berkeley really just adds to the weirdest of this film. Some parts are slow and I felt a litt drawn out but for the most part it's scary. Not scary as in you will not sleep for weeks, well maybe a few spots but it's enough to make you get the chills.I would recommend this movie, it's really nice to see a horror movie like this again.",The Dark and the Wicked
298,vsanthony,Deeply disturbing and thought-provoking. Not your usual horror drivel.,8,27 November 2020,"I'm not typically drawn to devil tales, but this is subtle, well-written and acted, and contains a few scenes (not the gory ones) that will stay in my head forever, for better or for worse. Hopefully they won't reappear in my consciousness when I'm facing my own death...
I'd love to see Bryan Bertino do a ghost movie - But I think he should limit the gore and work with atmosphere, which he does very well. He's capable of writing well, and choosing good actors. Just fyi, one of my other fairly recent horror movies is the American version of Let Me In (Haven't seen the original yet) - I love the horrors in the mind, more than the blood and gore. Violence isn't scary. SPOILER ALERT: In this film, the image of the devil creeping up the dying man's bed, with that smile on his face - Classic, truly disturbing. Also, the dialogue between the woman (it's been awhile so I forget names) and the young granddaughter or niece: When the girl suddenly smiles and says, ""Can you smell him?"" - A perfect piece of writing. The movies' not for everyone, but I thought it was terrific.",The Dark and the Wicked

309,bilgenturk,Disturbing,8,13 November 2020,I'm a real horror movie fan and I can apart this movie from it's similars. Because it has very good cinematography and acting is pretty good. I can see clearly the desperation in their faces. Nothing positive happened in this movie. I was excepting somehow happy ending like her father will wake up in the end. But I liked this one better. The environment looks like very dark and lonely. It's sound effects are okay. I hear the same violin effect in many horror movies recently. I think Hereditary was the first time I noticed it. But I like it. I still feel sad about their animals. Lol,The Dark and the Wicked
