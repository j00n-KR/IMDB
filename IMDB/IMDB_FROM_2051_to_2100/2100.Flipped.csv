0,MartinHafer,Exceptionally sweet...,9,28 August 2015,"I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.",Flipped
1,bkoganbing,Is he the one?,7,19 March 2014,"With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.",Flipped
2,SnoopyStyle,cute coming-of-age story,7,25 January 2016,"It's the summer of 1957. Bryce Loski and his family move into the neighborhood before his second grade. Juli Baker clings onto him but Bryce is annoyed by her. In the sixth grade, he tries to shake her off by asking out Sherry Stalls but they break up after a week. Juli loves sitting in a tree. One day, landscapers come to cut down her tree. She tries to save it but Bryce abandons her. She starts raising chicken. She gives eggs to Bryce. Two weeks after the tree got cut down, she discovers that Bryce is throwing them out. Her feelings for him flips. Bryce's feeling for her also flips with prodding from his grandfather.Madeline Carroll is adorable. Callan McAuliffe is a little stiff although that's his character. The constant narrations should stop somewhere before the middle. Rob Reiner has created Norman Rockwell nostalgia and added melodramatic problems. The effect is partly endearing. The flipping between the two points of view is compelling. It's one of Reiner's better movie in his recent years.",Flipped
3,nogodnomasters,IT'S ALL ABOUT JULI,9,12 December 2018,"The story consists of first person narrations. First his story, then her story. As always things are never as they seem. It is 1957 when Bryce moves next door to Juli. Juli is forceful, even at age 7. Bryce has great hair, eyes, and smile. Juli is bright and has personality. Byrce's family is somewhat shallow, except for the grandfather. Juli's family is poor by comparison but they have different priorities. The story quickly moves to the seventh grade when Juli realizes that Bryce, while good-looking, may indeed be shallow and not the person of character she should be seeking. Meanwhile, Bryce realizes his short comings and sees that Juli is a person of substance. In addition to the good back and forth for what may be expected for kids that age, it includes as a bonus a good father-daughter relationship film as Juli learns what she needs to know about life from her father. What is good about the movie is that the characters are real. They are not all good or all bad, but human beings attempting to do what they think is right in spite of their flaws.This movie has an indie feel, and is enjoyable to the young at heart for people of all ages, but may be especially enjoyable to seventh grade girls.Rebecca De Mornay is barely recognizable as an early 60's mom.One scene of ""violence"" when Bryce's dad slaps his teen daughter for calling him an a-hole.",Flipped
4,Calicodreamin,Cute,8,1 June 2021,Such a cute movie from beginning to end. The storytelling is unique and flows seamlessly. The characters are well cast and surprisingly well acted. An honest look at adolescence. A secret fave of mine.,Flipped
5,phd_travel,Insightful - worth watching.,8,16 January 2011,"This is a refreshing and involving look at relationships and how boys and girls feel differently at different ages. Its a grown up movie about children's relationships, not a movie just for kids. The different perspectives of the leads is fascinating to watch. The screenplay is thoughtful and has some good insights into human nature and family dynamics.Its good to see the high caliber supporting cast as the family members: Penelope Anne Miller, Rebecca De Mornay, Aidan Quinn and John Mahoney. Anthony Edwards is a standout.The 2 young leads are very competent. Callan does a good job. But sometimes you don't see his expressions reflecting the inner monologue. Madeline Carroll acts well. Never thought she was one of the more likable young actresses but she is suited to the role here.Worth watching and quite touching.",Flipped
6,StevePulaski,Reiner does it again,10,14 April 2011,"Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.",Flipped
7,ThomasDrufke,"When Life Was ""Simpler""",7,17 September 2019,"While the movie overall didn't completely land with me emotionally, I love a story about the time in your life when things were simpler and your world view was small. For Juli Baker and Bryce Loski, a childhood crush was life or death. With that, Flipped is a lovable story about your childhood love and perhaps the judgements you make about people before you really know them, something everyone is guilty of when you're young. The bow that gets wrapped at the end doesn't necessarily feel earned, but it's a pretty sweet little film that not many have seen, and that should change.7.0/10",Flipped
8,A_Different_Drummer,One of those rare movies that works in spite of itself,8,24 October 2016,"Reviewers' Notes: 1. A number of mainstream reviews noted that this was Reiner's most ambitious project in almost two decades. That is a ""back-handed compliment: and it is as much a comment on how he has been coasting for years, as it is a nod to this specific effort.2. The flaws in the film are -- ironically -- typified in the official poster for the project, where the artwork has the two leads sitting in the (infamous) tree on the same branch. Of course in the actual story they are never actually together in the tree. For film buffs of the future, this raises the question of whether the script was rewritten (and no one told the promo dept); or if simply someone inside the production company was trying to express what the film should have been...? 3. On the plus side, it is remarkable how much mileage Reiner gets from the shopworn devices of voice-over and double-POV. That the viewer comes to expect and get involved with these tricks is a big plus.4. The supporting cast is solid but not solid enough to overcome any shortcomings in the performances from the two young leads. The good news? There are no such shortcomings! The two young leads essentially pick up the film on their backs and carry it to the finish line.5. Reminded me in some ways of the original Korean MY SASSY GIRL (recommended!) which remains the most powerful rom-com of the last few decades. And that is not merely a back-handed compliment, that is the real deal. To suggest that love can blossom in such unlikely circumstances is, at the end of the day, what makes this film memorable.",Flipped
9,matthewssilverhammer,An Emotional Trainwreck,2,21 March 2018,"Rob Reiner is a dude who made actual movies, movies with an interest in being engaging and unique and entertaining. Spinal Tap was a groundbreaking mockumentary. Princess Bride helped turn the fantasy genre on its head. When Harry Met Sally and Stand By Me were incredibly personal and relatable. Few Good Men is fast-paced and wonderfully written. Flipped, on the other hand, is nothing but an emotional trainwreck that takes a unique structure conceit and goes nowhere with it.",Flipped
10,BeneCumb,Pleasant youth attraction story from the post WWII U.S.A.,8,11 September 2013,"Although my (pre-)teen years were decades ago, it is sometimes nice to remind and compare - in particular, if script and directing are good. In Flipped, it is so indeed, plus a good choice of child actors provides additional value to the movie. Unlike many youth films made in this century, the story here focuses on human values, generation ties, friendship etc, not on ""cuteness"" or being popular on account of personal wealth. The two neighboring families depicted are different (creative vs. formal), and those differences bring interesting angles and twists into the storyline. The cast is evenly strong as well, the grown-up characters are performed by Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn... The latter was the most interesting to me and his presence on screen was more frequent as well. Kevin Weisman performs a small, but very difficult role of a retarded person.Recommended to all families with children, although contemporary minor might consider the events as too naive from distant past... But family life can be without constant swearing, drugs, sexual hints etc. as well.",Flipped
11,ks-60500,Wow,7,25 April 2021,"Thanks netfilx bring this movie home and I watched in 2021, 11 years after the movie being shown. I'm not a person into romance story especially teen one. It's native and not sophisticated and just lame. But this movie changed my view and probably the most charming teen romance I ever watched. It just reminds me that who hasn't been through that time in life? Things back then just so pure and non-sexual. Story was just interesting.",Flipped
12,lewiskendell,An unexpected gem.,8,22 December 2010,"""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.",Flipped
13,saadgkhan,it was one of the most charming movies of 2010 and I can't wait to see it again.,7,19 December 2010,"FLIPPED – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Flipped is a simple, charming & adorable story about two teens in a he-said she-said style where both characters alternately presents their perspective on a shared set of events. I loved the whole idea; it brought the utmost needed freshness to teens movies. Its really sweet how the movie progresses and in the beginning Boy ""Bryce"" (Callan McAuliffe) running away from Julie (Callan McAuliffe) though as the time passes by Julie starts to cut off from Bryce & Bryce falls head over heels for her. The best part of the movie was Two sides of the story, that's how we know what was actually happening in both teens head while certain seats of events were happening. I have never seen anything like that before and it was really fascinating for me. Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll brought the utmost freshness on screen. Callan McAliffe and Madeline Carroll are defiantly the stars of tomorrow. They were sweet, lovable and adorable, if we couldn't relate to the characters the movie would have fallen on its face because obviously it's all about emotions, thoughts and feeling on very simple story line. Morgan Lilly as young Julie was the cutest thing on planet. All the supporting cast was simply great and the cinematography was awesome. There were few little things here and there which could have been better, for example I didn't find Bryce's mother very convincing as an actress plus in the entire movie the Julie waits & dreams about kissing Bryce but that kiss never happens though in the end Julie did say ""that he was still walking around with her first kiss, but not for long"" but still if they would have shown the kiss, it would have more impact. Nonetheless few flaws here and there it was one of the most charming movies of 2010 and I can't wait to see it again.",Flipped
14,napierslogs,"""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love",8,13 December 2010,"Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.",Flipped
15,KnightsofNi11,The joys and pains of growing up,8,13 July 2011,"After a less than impressive run of films from 1999 to 2005 I think Rob Reiner may be gaining back some of his lovable and charming talent he laid out in the 80's. Flipped is his most recent effort and it is a nostalgic look at the simpler times of a complicated adolescence. The film is told through the perspective of two eighth graders who begin to have feelings for each other after a long and complicated relationship that began in second grade. Part of the story will be told through the eyes and narration of Bryce Lovski and then we will see the same events reoccur from the perspective of Juli Baker. The film is practically overflowing with nostalgia, but it is also a sincerely heartwarming tale of love and growing up.My perception of the early 60's time period seen here has formed solely through movies I've seen and stories I've heard, but I really do feel like Reiner has captured the positive side of this time period so well. He combines it with the innocence of adolescence along with the complexity of growing up and has made a film that feels very personal and obviously means something to Reiner. And I feel like the emotions which this nostalgia brought about in him were transferred excellently to me and I felt a kind of honest sincerity coming through the atmosphere of this film.What's so pleasantly satisfying about this film is its utter devotion to its story. It tells such a meaningful and human tale of two lovable characters. This is a movie that tells the age old story of two unlikely people falling in love, but with such a unique twist. The narrative is different and fleshes out the story very well, and the story is not just a love story. It's a story about growing up and it emphasizes the influence of those around us. Flipped has a great supporting cast of characters, all different and special. They all influence our two main characters in their own ways, all possessing some sort of meaningful life lessons or words of wisdom. This is a pattern that is a little melodramatic but fits in place with this coming of age tale in a way that doesn't make it seem ridiculous or forced.This is a film that fits a specific kind of mood. It's sweet but idealized, honest but preachy. But it delivers what it has to offer in respectful moderation so I don't feel like I'm having emotional responses crammed down my throat. Flipped is a film we've seen before but not like this. The funny thing is I really didn't want to love this film, and yet I couldn't help myself. Rob Reiner films are becoming my guilty pleasure with films like this, The Bucket List, and When Harry Met Sally. I have to confess that I enjoyed Flipped so much. It is a very well done film with enough charm and wit to put a heartwarming smile on anybody's face.",Flipped
16,Quietb-1,Flipped and flipped out.,8,6 August 2010,"Juli flipped over Bryce. Bryce's dad flips out. Mom and sister wear their hair in a flip.Charming tale told in a ""he said she said"" often voice-over manner. Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.",Flipped
17,meydiana-65242,It brings me nostalgia with my first crush.,10,16 August 2021,"I stumbled on this movie while browsing through Netflix, and only decided to watch because it was a Rob Reiner film.I have to say that this was a wonderful film and definitely filed under ""rewatch again in the future"". If you've ever been in love for the first time, this movie will bring back a lot of those feels. I also loved the 50's setting that brought a nice ""Wonder Years"" vibe to the film.Anyone who gave this movie a 1 star rating is probably a ""flat"" person and has the same deep down emotional turmoil and prejudice as Bryce's dad. For everyone else, this movie will not disappoint.",Flipped
18,theinaniloquent,"""You never forgot your first love""",5,4 May 2012,"Before I begin, I haven't read the book. So if your looking for in-depth comparisons look elsewhere. I'm hear to express my thoughts on the movie itself, and it's quality. Not the books. Thank you.Listen to me carefully: the movie is not bad. It's well-translated from the book, it's *sometimes* well-acted, and it's well-directed. The movie has loads of heart and sorts of warmheartedness. So your probably asking yourself why this film stands with his 5. Well, I'll tell you. The movie is firstly contrived. I suspected it the moment I saw it. The most unique thing the movie does is it's narrative. You're are getting the guy's side to the story but then also the girl's side. It was actually quite nice. But aside from all that sappy stuff, the movie reaches too far and ends up being formulaic. Sure. It has that unique narrative side to it, but the other side? They tried to fill it up with as much clichés as possible, and by the end, it was about to explode. Next? The movie is sometimes really badly acted. Some of it seems like the two main characters are just running through it, waiting to the get to the finish line/money. But the main thing that bugged me was two characters. One is Bryce's dad Steven Loski played by Anthony Edwards. He was a complete asshole, but his attempts at trying to be an asshole are easily laughable. He has no reason to be an asshole either, he just goes on and on and on, and you're not believing one bit of it. The next is Juli's cousin Daniel Baker. When I first saw him, I thought it was a joke. Seriously. He was apparently brain-damaged from birth? I know people like that, and it wasn't anything like that. The movie tries to express something it really can't, but it tries so I give it credit for that.. So with all that said, Flipped is just another film. The director has made some profoundly great films, but Flipped seemed to be a film made in the duration of his mid-life crisis. I was entertaining, and found the movie had potential, but it didn't do anything new. And new is good. So the movie was bad.. Anyways, I recommend the movie for people who aren't too biased on movies that aren't trying to be something it's not. But, for me, this movie just doesn't do it. 5/10.",Flipped
19,aheaven2005,Not so efficient storytelling mechanism,7,10 January 2021,"Maybe it was me coming in with too much expectations about this one considering how much I love Rob Reiner, but I felt pretty much let down by it.

Flipped is a cute movie about the love of a girl for her neighbor: a boy who clearly doesn't feel the same way about her. However, as they grow older, the tables will turn slightly and the boy will start to develop a crush for her. But will it be too late? Will she still be interested in him? I'll let you watch the movie to find out. Don't expect a mind-blowing cinematographic experience, but for a day at home with the family, this movie might just be a decent enough choice.",Flipped

24,neenahhh,Such a refreshing addition to the romance genre,7,5 April 2011,"'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'.

The best part is you can watch the movie with your whole family. The soundtrack is really good. It's got some of the best 50's music I also like how Rob Reiner changed the setting to 1950's . Kind of makes more sense that back then people were more concerned about how presentable their houses looked.,Flipped

29,Suradit,Falls Flat,4,26 October 2014,"I like most of Rob Reiner's work. ""Stand By Me"" is one of my all-time favorites. This, however, was just tedious. Most of the drama and ""touching moments"" were ridiculous, trite and not even on a par with a mediocre soap opera. At times it seemed almost to be a parody of preachy after-school-specials. Too many things were going on, none of them developed beyond the most superficial level. It almost felt like it was put together from bits & pieces only loosely connected. Way too many segments were literally repeated, supposedly so we could see the same thing first from the boy's point of view, then the girl's. But it was essentially watching the same things happen twice with nothing gained from the additional waste of time.Given the film's director and some of the cast this was a major disappointment. If you want to watch something truly evocative of the 50's & 60's and genuinely coming-of-age, get ""Stand by Me"" and watch that (again). Give this a pass.",Flipped
30,InlyCii,about julie,8,16 March 2020,"I like and admire Julie, this stubborn little girl's insistence on things she loves is beyond my reach. Because of laziness, because of cowardice, because of frustration, because of reality, we always give up our minds and things for various excuses. When I think about it, there is always a girl who climbs a big tree while waiting for school every day. She will tirelessly report to us the direction of the school bus. I suddenly discovered that if I was twelve or three years old, I could not help but think that this girl was probably ""ill"". A girl climbing such a tall tree was dangerous and rude. I think I would also talk to her friends around me and hate her, but I would not understand her. You see, how ironic, I think the girls in the film are beautiful and romantic, and the boys are mediocre and boring, but if this plot does not happen in the movie but in life, I will become as distasteful as a boy girl. This made me realize my growth. Growth is disappointing and mature.",Flipped

Remember those days where much of your thoughts and actions were invested in trying to spend time with your special someone, while that person diligently avoided you, or vice versa? Well, if no, ""Flipped"" will be more than happy to take you back to that point of your life where the world isn't much of a concern, where responsibilities were minimal, where feelings were everything.Most of ""Flipped"" takes place in the year of 1963, a time where kids are required to talk to each other in order to achieve an actual conversation. (""What is this In-ter-net?"") Young Bryce, and the rest of the Loski family, has just moved in to a different neighborhood. And a new home comes with new neighbors. Bryce is getting ready for second grade, who believes that it will be torture because Juli Baker from across the street is publicly in love with him. Juli is trying to get Bryce to like her while Bryce is trying to get Juli to leave him alone. Now tell me, when you were younger, were you a Bryce or a Julie?We see that these kids act out their immediate emotions, and we know that they have yet to understand the depth and reasons behind them. What's to adore other than Bryce's dazzling eyes? So what if Juli likes to spend hours on top of a tree? These kids didn't really ask these questions to themselves, but they didn't need to. They are in the second grade, and are reasonably immature. But, as Bryce and Julie grow older, more mature, they start seeing things at a deeper, more curious perspective. A few years have passed, and Bryce and Juli notice things about the other that were invisible to them before, and their feelings start to flip.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/flipped/",Flipped
32,dishlady69,Teen Nostalgia meets Romcom,4,14 August 2017,"Rob Reiner's nostalgic romcom doesn't quite hit the mark the way his other films have. While the movie does convey the general awkwardness of being a teenager in the 1950s. Unfortunately, it also drags out the ignorance of a generation out along with it. Rebecca De Mornay and John Mahoney are thankfully around to save us all from the overwhelming ignorance conveyed by Anthony Edwards (who loses quite a few brownie points in my book for taking this part in the first place).Madeline Carroll is an incredible find, though her character is a little overdone, and Callan McAuliffe is convincing as the awkward teen as he most likely had just survived his awkward teens when cast for the film. It's a film you REALLY WANT to like if you're a fan of Reiner's work, but in general the film drags on a little too much, highlighting comments of VAST ignorance that the mixed audience viewing the film with me found very offensive.",Flipped
33,YJLcool,"a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film",8,15 March 2014,"Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

This puppy love definitely refreshed my eyes! Their warm heartening love was developed with logic, the flipped went with the flow, it has nothing like a crazy drama. Yet this romantic story still captured my eyes with its heartwarming moments.Besides the movie storyline, this movie really shows the difference between boys and girls inequality in mental maturity. I remembered I watched a video about an experiment, tester made some terrible taste juice and asked kids' options with a guilty face because of her terrible cooking skills; the experiment reflects the difference between boys and girls in young age 3-5 years old. Boys would honestly speak the truth of nasty taste, yet girls would show their compassion in young age, they would try to comfort the tester that her drink wasn't too terrible at all. That experiment was interesting, it just shows that girl naturally has better social skills development compared to the boy.Therefore Juli started her consciousness in age 7, and experienced some thoughtful thoughts about the ""complete painting view"" in her young age, and in the same age arrange, the boy, Bryce Losk just flipped.

37,GethinVanH,Same old same old,3,15 December 2010,"The last good movie Rob Reiner directed was ""Misery"" in 1990, nearly 20 years ago. Since then he's been pumping out a lot of crap like ""The American President"" and ""The Bucket List"". Flipped falls into the same category. It's a movie about a suburban, middle-class white American kid who comes of age. To top it all off, I discovered that Flipped is based on a book which takes place in the 2000s. You've seen this movie if you've seen 'My Girl' or 'The Wonder Years' you've already seen this movie.American Graffiti and Hairspray are at least more challenging and add something new. 'Flipped' adds nothing new except for a dual-narrative from both the teen boy and teen girl. This is interesting but since the male character is so utterly devoid of any charisma I couldn't stand listening to him. Reiner got it right with 'Stand By Me' by using an adult narrator (Dreyfuss) who could actually handle the task. The young actors are pretty bad narrators.There's nothing new here and it's pretty much an all-white cast. This is not a time to be sentimental about with it's lack of diversity and sterile environments. Reiner had the option of having the film take place in the 2000s and obviously rejected it. He prefers to work in the cocoon which is the 1960s coming of age story.",Flipped

40,sunraider,Freakin' Boring,3,27 November 2010,"I decided to ""rent"" this ON DEMAND because I recalled an interview Rob Reiner had done with conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt to discuss this movie at the time of its initial theatrical release. The way this film was talked about made you think it was another ""Stand By Me."" NOT! I hate to give this film such a low rating because there's nothing offensive about the film, but it is boring, slow and just plain uninteresting. I can't even bump up the rating because of chemistry, acting, or even soundtrack. There's simply nothing to recommend this film. The plot is so tame and clichéd, and yet the filmmaker does nothing special to make it seem fresh or inventive. The lead characters are uninteresting and while I don't expect young teens to generate sexual tension, I do expect them to have some chemistry or connect in such a way that makes you want to see the two together. At the expense of any real character development or even a semblance of a strong storyline, we get near-constant voice-over narration. Screen writing 101: show us, don't tell us! From the interview that Reiner gave, I understand that the original book on which the film is based was set in recent times, but Reiner decided to push it back to the early 60s. That would be OK if not for the all too modern expressions that come from the characters. The family worries about ""salmonella poisoning"" from the neighbor's eggs? Was the general public even aware of that issue in 1963? The young male lead complains about his neighbor ""stalking"" him and she in turn refers to him as being ""visually-challenged."" Had terms that those even been coined by 1963? The young teens casually throw out words like ""bullsh#$,"" ""jacksh#$,"" and say things like, ""are you freakin' mental?"" OK, I was born in the 70s so maybe these terms and phrases were common in 1963, but I can't recall any film made during that decade that had characters that sounded like these people did.

Doesn't really take hints and like to do things straight. Bryce, Juli's BFF, is the polar opposite. As shown through the beginning of the film, they develope feelings for each other and go through events.In Flipped, we follow through Juli and Bryce's narrations. Story's told from their perspective. The writers perfectly presented how a teenager's (or in this case, teenagers) mindset of falling in love is like.Now it does become draggy towards the second act, in which it feels like a family movie more than a romance one. The narration could also be reduced a little. On a technical aspect though, Flipped is a well crafted picture with the decent direction and unique colour-grading.Despite some minor flaws, Flipped is still a warm little entertainment.

I find that stories and romances like this always work better set in an older more innocent time period.I didn't realise until after that Rob Reiner had directed and in all honesty it wasn't too much of a shock. He did after all direct Stand By Me which is probably the daddy of coming of age stories.As in the title, what I liked about this film was when it 'Flipped'. We'd first get Bryce's take on something that happens after which the same series of events would be told by Juli. It's a simple story - girl likes boy, boy doesn't like girl and only realises he does just after the girl begins to not like him. It's nothing new or original but it told with a simplistic charm and works wonders thanks to the two leads and outstanding supporting cast.This is a nice film. One of the type that will put you in a good mood and make you long (if you don't already have it) for a true love story of your own. My only complaint is the running time which seems way too short. There's so much build up to the inevitable between Bryce and Juli that when it comes, that's it - end of film.I'd like to think that a sequel could be made to continue the story but it probably won't happen.",Flipped
55,PandoraProductions4,lovely film,8,17 August 2015,"Flipped is one of those gems that slip by, comparatively unnoticed. Slammed by critics upon it's initial release, it was a box office failure, barely making one fourteenth of it's budget. Years later, it has garnered a small but loyal following. The fact is, the movie is very good. One of 2010's best. It's not a standard teen flick, it occurs on the threshold of adolescence. Bryce and Juli are longtime neighbours. Juli has been obsessed with Bryce for years, but Bryce has never been interested in her. The movie's title is clever. As Bryce begins to become more keen on Juli, so she begins to lose interest in him. So they flip in their opinions of one another, basically. Being told from two perspectives- Bryce's and Juli's, adds to the ""flipped"" aspect. It's highly entertaining to see how their interpretations of the same events are different. Callan McAuliffe, who plays Bryce actually looks like a kid from the 50's (which is the movie's setting). Madeline Carroll's as cute as a button, and also gives a great performance. Unusual for a kids movie, the adult characters are also quite nicely fleshed out. It's Rob Reiner's best movie since ""A Few Good Men"".

The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra.

It's too light to be fully memorable, but it is endearing enough to enjoy. Bryce and Juli are two neighbors whose parents don't think too highly of each other. They've grown up together, and she had a crush on him throughout elementary school. Now that they're in middle school, they finally have the guts to tell each other how they really feel. But many events, such as those involving a sycamore tree and a hatch of chicks, mess with all of their emotions. Are they really into each other? Will their love last? The journey to the answers to these questions is sometimes awkward but still interesting. Rob Reiner's directing style suits the film well, but the script contains too many awkward moments which can distract from the sweetness of the film. The narration of the protagonists eventually becomes grating and excessive. The movement of the setting from the 2000s to the 1960s causes the film to feel too safe and clichéd. As a result, the movie wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without Madeline Caroll and Callan McAuliffe in the two lead roles. Their chemistry really is lasting, and their performances are really sensitive and emotional. Caroll's scene in the sycamore tree will leave you affected to the right degree. McAuliffe does a great job of portraying a sensitive but determined character eager to set things right, even though he is not brave enough to express his actual emotions. The music and score are also brilliantly crafted and fun to listen to. Flipped may not live up to its beloved source novel, but it is a charming and entertaining film.",Flipped

Bryce, however, feels that she's a pest and constantly tries to avoid her. But eventually the story ""flips""--Bryce starts having feelings for Juli and tries to express them.Overall, the story was great. The setting was changed from the more modern setting of the book to the late '50s and early '60s because back then it was harder to get hold of someone, making the whole romantic situation more awkward. There was one thing that confused me a little, but I won't say it because it'd spoil an important point in the story. If you're paying really close attention you'll notice it.The acting was great, Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe are definitely two to watch. I still remember that Subway commercial that Madeline did and she's grown a lot. The two do have a lot of chemistry and they portray the awkwardness of romance and just being a teenager very well. For the most part, character development was good. Some of the minor characters weren't developed as well, but hey, they're minor characters for a reason.I think the ending was the most beautiful part. I wasn't expecting it at all, and it was really moving. There's a reason this movie won the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award.I've watched this movie multiple times, and every time I find myself with a huge grin that I just can't seem to get rid of afterwards. I can't get enough of it. I guess you could say I flipped over Flipped.",Flipped

66,WHYeat,Excellent. Better than I expected.,9,6 August 2010,"iridescent - adjective: showing luminous colors that seem to change when seen from different angles When I hear ""romantic comedy"" I think of 20 something year olds in New York swapping corny lines via Twitter at a bar. Flipped takes a more adolescent perspective on love in a quainter town and in a quainter time. Interestingly enough, even though the main characters are children, the movie targets an adult crowd. Not because there is adult content, but because it takes an adult who has gone through life's lessons to appreciate the complex and pithy analogy and irony. Although in one intense scene a mom ushered her children out of the theater, don't bring your 4 year olds.Flipped is a story about Bryce Loski and Juli Baker, both of whom narrate the story. The movie begins with Bryce's perspective.Bryce's Perspective: He just moved into town. He's in the moving truck helping his father with the boxes until Juli interrupts and tries to help. His father emphasizes that there are valuables in the boxes, but she can't seem to take a clue. ""Shouldn't you go help your mother in the kitchen, Bryce?"" After a second, the confusion on his face vanishes once he understands his father's ploy. He hops out of the truck and Juli follows closely behind. She puts her arm around him. In defense against cooties he flails his arms, but she somehow gets a hold of his hand. He looks right at her face in disgust. Fortunately, his mom comes out. He resorts to his only defense for a boy his age - he hides behind his mom. Juli is so annoying! Juli's Perspective: Bryce just moved into town. Attracted by his ""dazzling"" eyes, she offers to help, but not 2 minutes pass and his father sends him into the house. She could tell from his face he didn't want to go, so she went after him to see if he'd like to play for a bit before he got stuck inside. To her surprise, Bryce takes her hand and looks lovingly into her eyes. Unfortunately, his mom comes out. Embarrassed about his feelings for her, Bryce hides behind his mom. Bryce is so shy! The entire movie follows this pattern. Bryce and Juli take turns describing their thoughts and motives. It's interesting to watch their contradicting thoughts converge into a single stream of unfolding events. The audience also gets a sense of Bryce's and Juli's personalities. Although Bryce is the handsome young kid at school their vastly different narration proves which of the two has more character. The first scene, Bryce's and Juli's first encounter, gives the false impression that Flipped is a love story. It kind of is. But although the thread that holds everything together is the love story between Bryce and Juli the fabric of the story is substance. The substance of character. Each character's role provides a perspective and a life lesson. The fulcrum upon which these morals are balanced is best represented by the sycamore tree - the gem of the town.The sycamore tree has many symbolic interpretations - all of which are equally appropriate for the story and its characters. Vanity. Juli is enthralled by those ""dazzling"" eyes and is irrationally in love with Bryce. Bryce is equally irrational in his disdain of Juli. Bryce's father is especially guilty of this sin. He washes away the pain of lost aspirations with bourbon and takes comfort in condescension. He refuses Juli's fresh eggs produced by her hens simply because of the Bakers' disheveled front yard. However, the sycamore tree could also represent divinity, protection and strength. Juli's favorite spot in town is the peak of the sycamore tree. Here she reveled in the sunset igniting the surrounding clouds and the wind kissing her skin. She suddenly understood what her father meant when he said the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Juli could see it in the landscape. She could even see it in Bryce, but is he greater or less than the sum of his parts? When the tree's owner decided to cut it down, Juli defended it by remaining in the tree. But when it eventually came down, her vanity, her irrational love, began to come down as well. Juli questions the whole that is Bryce Loski. Likewise, Bryce begins to see Juli from a different angle.Flipped is a gem in itself. I laughed. I cried. No I didn't, but it was very moving. And the writing is pretty good. If you enjoyed The Wonder Years or if you ever daydreamed about that one girl you kissed when you were 13, you'll get a nostalgic kick out of Flipped. If you don't know The Wonder Years and you've never been kissed, you'll still love it. It's flippin' great.Read more chick flick reviews for men @ RatedChick.com",Flipped

The cast, the production, the story line, the ambient feel seem to work together so well. The girl looked weird and annoying in the first scenes but eventually she will grow on you as story going. I saw some comments about the choice for 50's-60's theme was unnecessary. I totally disagree. It is the major part of what made this movie so heartwarming. It would not have worked in present time line. No girls would feed her chicken in the backyard. The boy would not have been so nice to her even if he does not like her. In these days, if you annoyed a girl you just post something to embarrass her in social networks or just try to take advantage of her. So it is a solid reason to go back in much nicer time.

79,GeneralUrsus,Flopped,1,23 May 2011,"From the opening frames this film had a cloying, cutesy ersatz sweetness that was annoying. The movie's look and feel resembles a television episode. Flipped which is based on a novel seems like a watered down, rip-off of television's The Wonder Years. However this material is neither funny, heartwarming or memorable on any level.The acting across the boards is stilted, forced and borders on caricature particularly from Anthony Edwards as a belligerent father who's abusive qualities stem from his unfulfilled desires to be a musician. The only decent performance in the film is from character actor John Mahoney. His sweet, endearing portrayal as a grandfather is honest, moving and presents the only flowering hope that this film might blossom.What really destroys this film though is the constant use of narration. At least 80% of the movie is narrated in dull, garbled monologues from both of the two main characters. Another major flaw is the endless ping- pong, story telling device where we see the same scene over again from the perspective of each of the two main characters.We witness entire passages of this film devoted to nonsensical issues like whether or not to eat the neighbor's farm fresh eggs because they might be tainted by salmonella. The film does not draw us in, the characters are bland, the situations are ridiculous and the pacing is monotonous. I have seen Folger's Coffee Commercials that were more uplifting than this drivel.

The presentation of the movie is so practical and the expression of love at a tender age has been brought about in such intricate detail, it can very well question the understanding of love we adults claim to have.Each scene has been given the right amount of time and attention in a relaxed pace without making the story look either stuck anywhere or rushed towards the end. Since it has been given a narrative structure, almost every major event in the story is shown from both Juli and Bryce's perspectives, giving the audience total freedom to decide which side they relate more to. Family conflicts, problems often faced by middle-class households, and social differences prevalent in the society have been very sensitively showcased.Some more scenes describing the kind of relationships Juli and Bryce had with their respective siblings could have made the story fuller.

All the happy moments and all the emotional roller-coaster that came with it. My problem are the voice overs. The ENTIRE movie format is based on them. We're already seeing whats happening so we don't need the protagonists explaining it to us. Maybe some small bits would've worked. But not every single step. Not the full time. It gets tedious.

85,blackfirepro,"Chickens, Tree Sap, and First Kisses",8,26 July 2010,"Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com",Flipped
86,user1089r,Visually gorgeous with fatal flaws,6,24 December 2010,"Reviewed from DVD.No interactive menu. Navigation problems: each time you start the movie, you must fast-forward through all six commercials, one at a time. No chapters; if you want to reach the spot where you left off, you must fast-forward to it. There are subtitles, but the English ones are thoroughly hidden: surprisingly, you must hover over ""Español"" to see ""English"". And this is a Rob Reiner film? This can turn out to be important (see below).Very lovely video quality. This is simply a very beautiful movie. The protagonist in particular -- also the narrator of the story -- played by Callan McAuliffe, does a fine job, especially for a fourteen-year-old. Unfortunately, this is not the case for his wannabe girlfriend, played by Madeline Carroll, a very unfortunate choice.Since the plot is for the most part pretty drab, it is up to the director and the actors to make up for it, but Ms. Carroll's performance in a prominent role is truly annoying, making the film almost unwatchable, which only adds to the problem. After half an hour, I actually turned on the subtitles and muted the sound, so that I could avoid listening to her voice. It must be said, however, that the teenage girl she played is more than a little aggressive, which only aggravated the problem with her speaking voice.I repeat, this is a visually very beautiful movie; I would even say stunning. If you feel you can somehow tolerate the annoyance of Ms. Carroll's interpretation of the protagonist's girlfriend and the unimaginative storyline, give it a try.",Flipped
87,Starlitelet,Purity and simplicity at its best!,9,27 May 2011,"I was in the mood for some romantic comedy film and luckily came across Flipped. I was sceptical at first, since the casts are not very known (even though they are young) and I did not see any promotions of movie. So I decided to watch the trailer. I caught a glimpse of Callan McAuliffe. He looked awfully familiar until I remembered seeing him in I Am Number Four. I Am Number Four was not a memorable movie, but I remember that Callan McAuliffe caught my attention more than Alex Pettyfer. Acting:I was curious to see how much Callan would be able to offer to Flipped. Needless to say, he stole my heart. A child actor (he was 15 at that time) was able to make me reminisce and feel nostalgic about my childhood crushes. He did not do much, but his simple emotions and gestures gave so much depth to his character, Bryce Loski. He was so pure and innocent, yet trouble minded. This guy can definitely act. He successfully wins the hearts of the audience. His performance is on the same level as Madeline Carroll, who is Juli Baker, his puppy love. They both go hand in hand because when they are alone, you feel their pain or happiness. However, when they are together, they shine even more. Juli plays the witty and adventurous girl with just the right amount of purity. I am amazed by their acting because their acting seemed so real and genuine.As for the other actors, they did not make the movie better. I was not astound by any of their performances because anyone could have played them, really. Their roles did seem realistic and allowed the storyline to flow smoothly. 9.5/10Storyline:The plot is extremely simple, yet beautiful. It seemed a little too simple for me when I saw the trailer. It is like the boy having this crush on his next door neighbour and they start blooming. Nevertheless, it was much more magical than this. Even though the plot still remained simple like how I originally thought of it, there was a huge pathos factor attached to it. I really believe it is hard to create these type of genres and make the audience feel attached to the characters. It takes a huge amount of work for the actors and director. I really liked how we saw from both of their perspectives. In other words, they played the same scene twice to show each other point of view. It definitely did not get redundant, and I thought it was the one of the film's strong points.There were some minor cons that I thought could have made the movie better. Like, they should have delved more into Uncle Daniel. That being said, there should be more development between the two families and why they are like that. There were moments where I asked a lot of why and how questions. One of them being why did Mr.Loski have apathy on the Baker's family. Entertainment:On a side note, Flipped reminds me of 5 centimetres per second. It is a beautiful anime movie. Not many people appreciate the movie because it is too simple and boring. However, I enjoyed that anime and perhaps that is why I enjoyed or loved Flipped. They carry a lot of emotions and depth on a different dimensions. In other words, not everything is explained in black and white. Emotions cry louder than words. These two literatures delve into the main character's development in life in such a realistic manner that most people can relate to. It has probably happened to us. This is no typical comedy movie, but it was way better than the sappy comedies I have seen recently. It made me smile and sad at the same time. I think this is appropriate or should be appreciated by any age group. It makes adults reminisce, whereas teenagers get a glimpse of what love is about. I hope to see more movies like this one!9.5/10",Flipped

92,brettster,"Winning, beautifully moving and well-acted coming-of-age story",10,14 August 2010,"Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters.

103,cleu_fergie,A true gem.,10,25 August 2011,"To be completely honest with all of you, I haven't taken a liking to many of the recent movies, considering they're either about giant robots, aliens, or a terrible prequel to a classic. This movie came out just last year, and it's now one of my favourite movies. For a movie to get into my 'Favourite movies list' it has to have great acting, a believable storyline, characters that make you feel a connection with them and most importantly, the ability to make me think. To have this movie make it onto that list alongside titles like The Shawshank Redemption, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas and Little Miss Sunshine, well then, this movie is amazing.The two leads are about 15 and 16 this year, which is roughly my age. I'm going to tell you the truth, I really do not like the new face of Hollywood. The acting is blunt and the actors aren't being the characters. However, McAuliffe and Carroll have brought their respective characters' personalities out. They've put it out for all to see and sympathise with, taking the audience on a beautiful journey in their lives. I loved the two characters from the very beginning, and was intrigued by how practical and down to earth they were. What I loved was how the storyline unfolded. Both sides of this childhood romance was shown, both parties able to tell their side of the story. Typically, a romance is told in such a way that there's always one victim in the situation, and s/he cries until the other welcomes them back with open arms. Well boo hoo. In Flipped, both Bryce and Juli's sides were told from the first person point of view, which allows the readers to feel for the two characters as though they were part of the romance. The technique used was such a personal one, one which connected the audience with the movie. The audience was allowed a trek inside both their minds, all the while just thinking 'Oh, just get together already!' It made me want to reach into the screen and yell 'Now, elope.'Flipped will forever be on my 'Watch Forever list'. A timeless, innocent romance of two young loves which will be enjoyed by all. A definite 9/10.",Flipped
104,sabrinatheblogster,"Oh but the food! (Secretly sniffing someone is not okay, mkay?)",4,24 January 2014,"The thing with this movie is: it's a decent story but it's wrong on so many levels.First of all, in the story these kids don't age beyond, what, twelve? They should not be thinking about love. They should be thinking about having fun, being creative, doing things, making friends, and so on. This drama does not fit into the lives of such young people. It's not romantic, it's unhealthy.Second, when a guy stalks a girl like that it's creepy, but when a girl stalks a guy like that it's cute? Geez talk about double standards, let alone the message this sends out to young people. Just chase a person long enough and he/she will fall for you eventually. Spoiler: that's not the way it works, folks. If he or she is just not that into you, move on. Also, don't stalk people. It's wrong, mmkay? And take no for an answer, mmkay? Aaaaand don't go secretly sniffing people, no matter if you're a boy or a girl, and no matter if he/she smells like water melon, cheese sticks, or old books. Just don't. do. it. It's f*cking creepy and NOT cute. Mmkay? Third, as one of the plus sides, this movie totally made me discover something about myself. When they have the Boy Auction - or whatever (again, at that age?! And holy sh*t, talk about shallow standards) - there's a boy being auctioned as the first of them all. He seems so very uninteresting but then we find out he's carrying a basket with chicken salad sandwiches, onion dip, and cherry pie. That's when I went: 'hell that's my kind of guy. I'd date him.' So there's that standard, reaffirmed by the next scene where Bryce asks the blonde if they can please talk about something else than tans or food. Tans, yes, but food? You no like to talk about food? Go f*ck yourself, Bryce Lovski, food is awesome. How boring is he? Also, 'Bryce Lovski'? Does anyone notice the resemblance with 'Kyle Brovlovski'? South Park fantasy maybe? Last but not least, in the last scene Julie goes 'and then, for the first time we really talked' (or something). Why on earth would you chase a guy for so many years if you don't even feel like you've had a decent conversation with him? It's so stupid my vocabulary doesn't even suffice to describe it.Stupid movie, stupid priorities, stupid standards, loved the food.",Flipped

The movie has a really beautiful storyline. It is honest and real.
Flipped, is not like another love story. It is about seeing the other picture, not judging the book by its cover. I found the two side story telling entertaining and eyes opening. Young and innocent love, different backgrounds.. Flipped showed us exactly how it should be, that no matter what, we are all different but love is the same. Love is beautiful and has no borders.

This movie was one of those stumbled upon gems that sneaks up on you and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Some heavy hitting actors and Rob Reiner's gifted writing and oversight help raise this movie up from what at first glance looks like another sappy coming of age movie. But what really makes this movie stand out is the charming performances of the two adorable, perfectly cast middle schoolers whose lives we get to follow.

She pursues him tirelessly and he continually rebuffs her. This is a great piece of scripting, directing and editing, as you see significant events between the two twice. Once through the eyes of each with often different recollections. The younger Juli is played charmingly by Morgan Lily. The older one, around 13-14 played by Madeline Carroll steals the show. Carroll has true acting chops and one would hope that there will be opportunities for her in Hollywood. Callan McAuliffe is an absurdly handsome young man as Bryce, Juli's obsession. He conveys Bryce's feelings well and he takes you back to that age convincingly. He is a confused adolescent, trying to fit in and please everybody. The rest of the cast is first-rate led by old pro John Mahoney of ""Frazier"" as Bryce's grandfather. Juli's parents are played nicely by Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller. Bryce's mom is Rebecca DeMornay and his unlikable dad is played well by Anthony Edwards. How nice to see a movie with characters I care about. A nice little yarn.",Flipped

I was left wondering my days back in elementary school, the teenage love, mood swings, unpredictable behavior and the never ending saga of changes. Although there are some parts that I suppose can add more substance like the character of professor Simon. After watching the movie I was left quietly sitting in our living room area and just stare blankly and I was smiling (sounds crazy but it's true).

There were a lot of happy moments, some sad moments. I really liked that the plot constantly shifts from the guy's point of view to the girl's point of view so we can better understand everything that's going on. It has its fair share of drama and sweetness that really brought back some childhood memories. The premise of first love kind of movie really got me on board with this film. It also shares some truthful life lessons with us and lets us relive all of those first love feelings.

123,LitCritChas,"Nitpick if you want to, but it doesn't change the story...",8,7 March 2011,"I picked up the film when I found it on sale in a Blockbuster that was having a ""going out of business"" sale. I was not dissatisfied with what I bought in the least. It was both a cathartic and feel-good film all at once. Through watching it, you can be transported back to that time when you had your own first crush and were that guy or girl with a crush. It also did a beautiful job of showing the maturation which occurs from the initial crush to the actual budding of love. I felt the challenges set forth in testing the character strengths of both protagonists and pushing them to become better individuals and partners for one another. Rob Reiner did a wonderful job in direction and casting prodding the actors to grow and develop in a realistic manner over the course of the film. The supporting adult cast was well cast and artfully played, giving subtleties that made me appreciate them & their handiwork. They also developed their characters in a manner that didn't distract from the main protagonists. I wish the same could be said about the other young teenage actors who almost all came out as cardboard cut-out stereotypes that have been rehashed from young teenage movie to young teenage movie.Now for my nitpicks: An interesting thing I noticed was that Rob Reiner takes the novel out of the time period it was originally set in: 1994 - 2000 and puts it instead in the ever nostalgic 1957 - 1963 time period (when he himself was the age of the protagonists). After discovering this directorial choice: the two issues I had with the film were immediately explained and made sense.First, the critique of government run facilities that exists in the film wasn't as vocal at the time. I'm sure it existed, but overall there was a general trust of the government & its facilities--the expansion of which through the New Deal had just helped the nation get through the Great Depression & WWII--or at least that's what the commonly held belief was at the time. It isn't until the fallout from Carter's presidency & the emergence of the Reagan Revolution that this trend would be reversed--and a distrust of government facilities would begin to appear and become more popular. So the 1994 - 2000 setting of the book makes the existence of this critique make complete sense in a way that a 1957 - 1963 setting of the film does not.My second nitpick was with the incongruity of names with the generations. Grandpa Chet would work out to be in the book part of the same cohort as Lynetta, Skylar (a name that according to most name graphs indicates wasn't used in the US until the 1980s--when the original character in the book would've been born), Matt, & Mark have been ""aged back"" to--i.e. he was born in the book during the early - mid 1940s as his name suggests. It also wasn't just Chet & Skylar but nearly all of the other characters who had names that were less popular during the time period the film was recast in (for their specific generations) than in the original time period of the book. However I doubt most people would notice such minute details or even care about them, not when presented with such a heart-warming coming of age story set to some of the best music Doo Wop has given us.Overall, I'd say that you really have to nitpick (like I did) to find fault with Flipped--or be a confirmed cynic.",Flipped

Only that these 2 movies I have mentioned are on 2 different genre.I love the idea that the scriptwriter has managed to make a story that is completely different from others. Sure we have watched many narrated movies, but narrated by 2 different people with different perspectives? That was priceless, seriously. I have never seen something like this.Love does not come in a blink. Sometimes we have to undergo the very same process that Juli and Bryce did and their story was very lovely and made me think that we have to appreciate what is already there for us.

130,kpellerin,Flipped - A Heartland Truly Moving Picture,10,9 August 2010,"This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way.

141,kathy89996,"A Stumbled Upon Movie, and So VERY Grateful",9,30 June 2011,"I forgot how I ended up finding this movie, I had assumed it was like any other romantic movie, Flipped however is so much sweeter and with more individual and original characters, each with their own unique personality and individual quirks. The way the film is structured and narrated from each protagonist makes it even more heartwarming. It is unexpectedly different, original even, in comparison to the regurgitated romantic comedy movies that have no depth. It is a movie for all ages as Flipped explores each family member and I assure you, you can definitely relate to one of them in someway and feel comfortable and warm watching this movie. I fell in love with the cast, each actor fitted in their roles perfectly.It has its funny moments, cute, heart-throbbing and sad moments; it's Truly Wonderful, Original and sweet. A Great family movie. With an original storyline and a lovely portrayal of one family's bonds.",Flipped

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.",Flipped

(a mistake on my part, I hadn't paid attention on the DVD cover, and for a European family, the language and the accent of the French-Canadien dubbers is simply horrible, the translation of the original dialogue is too weird for us, scriptwriters write the texts in Canadian-French almost word for word. For exemple : ""for real"" in English become ""pour vrai"" in French-Canadian, but in French from France or Belgium, ""for real"" is translated by : ""pour de vrai ou vraiment !"". So, because of that, the film was, for us, not as so beautiful as it had to have been. It's a cute film, but I will have to see it a second time in the original language to make a real and good review.
And for my friends from French Canada counties, no worries, I love you, I love your accent, I love your expressions so naïve... Then ""Tabernacle"", try to do good translation from English (not a word to word) and you will be great in all over the world for the French people :)

147,kwqd,Very enjoyable movie,9,26 December 2010,"I really enjoyed this movie. As a matter of fact, it is the first movie I immediately watched again (DVD) since the 1970s (theater). As noted elsewhere, this is a refreshing departure from the standard special effects vehicles. It captures the mood and pace of the 1960s nicely. The alternate perspectives of the two main characters worked well, and the development of the characters is adroitly done. I actually did not recognize Penelope Ann Miller and Rebecca DeMornay until the end credits. This may be because I had not seen either actor in a movie for some years, but also probably equally due to their makeup and clothing. Their portrayal of 1960s housewives was very effective. Overall, visually, this movie does a great job of putting the viewer into the 1960s. Not sure how effective this would be for someone who did not experience the 1960s. Highly recommended.",Flipped

I had no idea what the movie was about before I saw it the first time. Went blindly for it putting my complete faith on my sister's recommendation which mostly would be great. And then it was altogether a heavenly feel. Was a bliss, every dialogue and the importance of each character and the emotional touch that binds everything together has been done brilliantly. It never happens but I loved the movie so much that I saw it twice back to back without a break. Most movies have a fixed plot but the drama is a genre where the director can explore things way beyond the story and give serious importance to granular emotions. This kid love story is no way lesser than the masterpiece trilogy ""Before Sunrise...."". This is one of the best feel-good movies that anyone would love irrespective of age and taste. It sometimes feels like the IMDb that once was alive before 6 years is completely messed up now. There is no correct way to differentiate good movies from the bad ones when the superhero movies usually get 7 and above rating. This one should definitely be an 8 pointer and above, also surely deserves a strong place in TOP 250 when ""Inside Out"" can be in.",Flipped

There are a few swears, when they are talking about Julies eggs from the chickens in her science experiment, when Bryce is laying in bed after that thinking that his friend didn't know anything about chickens, one during the basket boy scene.

The way the emotions of both sides of coin ( the boy and the girl) have been portrayed is very connecting. At all point of time while watching the movie one can actually put herself/himself in the shoes of the characters. Family ties, childhood notions, societal upbringing and school for teenagers have actually been brought to life.A must watch for audience appreciating deep emotions reflected via a common man's life. Its a dive into everyone's childhood dreams. A reflection of how children learn, grow and love truly. Callan and Madeline have given a clean soul to the characters visualized by Rob Reiner.

151,nep-5,Memorable feel good film!,10,18 December 2010,"I'm usually more into sci-fi or horror flicks so wasn't expecting much from a love story. The trailer reminded me a little of when I was a kid and first watched the film Stand By Me which is still one of my all time favourites, maybe it was just the music. I decided to watch Flipped because I've seen every other film thats been released over the past few years and felt I'd ran out of options of decent films to watch so thought what the hell it can't hurt to give this a try. As I began to watch the film I was drawn into the magic of the story like I was a part of it. I could imagine myself at that age and lots of happy memories began to flow back and perhaps some regrets too, things I wished I'd done at a younger age but was now too late. I loved how the film flipped from each perspective giving me an insight into one another's thoughts. I quickly realised that this film was one of the best feel good films I'd seen in along time, one which I'll enjoy talking about and recommending to my friends for a while and surely a film I'll never forget. I can't describe it other than the film has a magic feel to it that one doesn't see in films anymore. The director and everyone who took part in making this did an excellent job and the acting was superb. I hate to admit but I enjoyed the film so much my eyes began to water a little, sad I know but inside I feel happy enough to write this review to spread the word of how truly magnificent the film really is. Watch with your partner or alone, either way you'll be happy you didn't give this film a miss... Enjoy!Long live the sycamore tree! :)",Flipped

We should keep in mind that even a saint will make faults, as long as he would showed his repentance and made an apology to who he loved and cared.Thanks to Juli, she forgave the man who she pursued for a long time,and finally accepted him.Not for his family's wealth , but for his own kind heart and true love for her",Flipped
153,Eitakda,Waste of time- a slaughter of character development,2,8 August 2020,"This film had great potential to be beautiful but the character of Bryce was too inherently dislikable, and I did not wish him a happy ending. The reason why he was that way was not explored enough (the subplot surrounding his father) to forgive or even try to understand his behaviour. Juli was a beautifully spirited character and the film followed her journey of realising that Bryce was not all she first saw in him. Therefore, the ending was out of place, and frankly a bit of a cop out.I came for a wholesome coming of age film and left feeling empty and like I'd wasted my time.",Flipped

The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie.

Does Flipped compare to other similar Reiner films, like Stand By Me? No. But what Flipped does, it does well. The acting is genuine, and manages to capture a semblance of the timeless facets of youth that seem unburdened by time. Although the film can err on playing out like something out of a 50's TV series, Reiner manages to blend the cutesy kitsch with touching moments that keep this film from turning into a sugary mess. One could argue the film is slow and uneventful, and to a certain extant I agree. Despite this, Flipped manages to intrigue and make you feel all fuzzy inside. 8/10. Great movie!",Flipped

This movie though I couldn't get into as much as I really wanted to. The thought that continuously crept into my head was how big of an arrogant a-hole Bryce was. He is the stereotypical douche that we all knew in high school who was mean and rude to people because he thought it made him look cool. Then finally he decides what he wants and thinks he deserves it. Goes the whole movie being just a crappy person then decides he wants juli now and decides he will start being nice to get what he wants.I get what they were trying to do with this movie but I think the execution was poorly done. Especially with Bryce's character.In conclusion there will be plenty of people that will love the movie but I couldn't get over my hatred of Bryce and his character to enjoy this movie.",Flipped

Therefore, he has always treated the heroine with the arguments of others, not daring to tell his true thoughts.And Julie is different. She has the courage to express her emotions. Even if she fails, she will continue to work hard. She is obsessed with what she loves and will not give up until the last moment.There are also some very beautiful sentences in the movie, like
""Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare. ""

This movie makes one appreciate the innocence and spontaneity of children and how adults can either foster this creativity or block it. It is a deep movie which gives meaning to appreciating the simple things in life, and not take things for granted. It is also an example of how children can often be the real teachers rather than the other way round. It is an example of how being open to others' differences may lead to opening new doors and how bitter and lonely can some people become when they are set in their own ways. I thought the way the narration switched between the 2 child protagonists, was brilliant. We always want to hear both sides of a 'love' story, and this film gives you that. This is not just a story of love at first sight, but it is a chance to ponder on different characters who represent the persons' next door. Who ever seems strong may be weak, and who ever seems cuckoo may be the trend setter. ""To each his own"" - Who are we to judge?",Flipped

Was not disappointed.Like some of Hayao Miyazaki's films (and Makoto Shinkai's too), this tells young love effectively. It makes viewers reminisce and look back to their sweet years of childhood. That nostalgia is what makes the film exceptional. It made me wish I had seen the bigger picture back then. It made me wish I had been a little more mature.I fell in love with Flipped right away. I saw a part of myself in there, and I'm sure viewers will somehow relate to the film as well. We all fell in love; some of us very young, some even a little late. But the point is you fell in love the first time and you won't forget the feeling . . . ever.And what makes Flipped even more beautiful is that shines a light on family. It somehow explains why parents behave like they do, why some of them are cold and bitter, forgiving and kind.Flipped is a feel-good movie sure to give you a trip down memory lane.",Flipped

The film itself is a coming of age story set in America in the 50's, following the story of two young teens as they mature and age. This is just a very brief outline of the film itself, but overall the film includes comedy, romance, drama at points, and really just a heart felt story. It was thoroughly enjoyable to watch and leaves you feeling happy! It's also easily relatable as we've all lived through those years of having to grow up and mature and it's also interesting as the film looks at the female and male perspective of a situation, which is funny when comparing them. Anyway, I'm blabbering, but this film is WELL worth watching, it's a good family film and can be watched between friends! It deserves more praise! Hope I helped!",Flipped
167,kimberkreation,My Review of Flipped,9,19 August 2010,"This film takes a more adolescent perspective on love The story is set in the late 50s to early 60's.It starts off when a new family moves in across the street.The young girl played by Madeline Carroll named Juli Baker,who see's the new boy across the street played by Callan McAuliffe named Bryce Loski and has the most stunning eyes she has ever seen. Rob Reiner did a superb job telling it entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters Bryce and Juli tells each side of the story from each point of view. Sometimes the views are not the same. Juli's favorite spot in town is the top of the sycamore tree which is cut down by the yards owner. Juli starts to questions the whole that is Bryce Loski. Likewise, Bryce begins to see Juli from a different angle.Bryce's father played by Anthony Edwards is a typical father of the late 50's. He cares more about the outside appearance then what is really within. He has a darkness inside of him. The wife played by Rebecca De Mornay is susie home maker type of role. The grandfather father played by John Mahoney is a soft speaking man, who moves in with the Loski family tries to get Bryce to see the world with open eyes.It has a great use of that periods music that is well thought out. All-in-all this is a wholesome family film. Highly recommend to see it.",Flipped

The plot is genuine and I'm sure it'll take you back to your teenage years, when you had that first seemingly ever-lasting crush and you'll savor every second of it.

169,julie-anne00,Beautiful and moving; an adaptation truly worthy of the novel,9,16 June 2011,"Alright, I admit, my opinion on Flipped is biased. The book came out when I was young and it quickly became one of my favorite adolescence books. I'd always wished for a movie based on it, but I never really expected one... which is why, to my surprise, when looking through movies on demand today, I saw it! Of course I immediately had to watch it.I wasn't sure what to expect when I started the movie, but by the end I was thrilled. In my opinion, the movie is a near perfect adaptation. It does not try to be more or less than the novel itself. To me, it was exactly what I'd always pictured a film adaptation to be; a story visualizing the touching, vibrant, and stunning images I'd always imagined in my head when reading Flipped for the first time, and more. The changes, (thankfully few), such as the change in time frame from the novel, add to the story instead of distracting or detracting from it. There are strong performances by the lead actors and actresses all around, and the feel of the novel is apparent and alluring as ever throughout the entire movie. It was impossible not to feel a dreamy sense of nostalgia while watching it; the same words I remember reading years ago, paired with the fresh, crisp, and beautiful directing of the movie left me feeling completely satisfied as the credits rolled at the end. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, no; just as Flipped was not the best book I've ever read. However, that's not to criticize either in any way. Both tell the realistic, raw, sometimes heartwarming and sometimes bittersweet story of the relationship between a boy and a girl as they grow throughout childhood and adolescence, learning about what is truly important to them every step along the way. It portrays strong feelings and opinions that touch the viewer (or reader) without being in your face. It tells and reflects on many important issues; from courage and independence to prejudice and loss, the story of Flipped is definitely one to be remembered. In short, I loved this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody, especially those who were fans of the book. It's as refreshing and original as the novel, creatively shot while staying true to its roots, and excellently executed as a whole.",Flipped

Did you behave in some similar ways ever?I do admire that it arouse me some thinking about love not only for adolescents. It's quite amazing that Julia flipped at the first sight on Bryce by his dazzling eyes. It is incredible that you can find something distinct on your lover, i means, you will appeal to some attributes your lover possess. Also, i believed this story only can happen in America. Since the parents in China will allow the relationship by no means in school, they nip it in the bud.I think it was quite good to depict every scene from two different views, one from Julia and the other one from Bryce, since i felt curious about what he or she was thinking as well as that did he or she feel my love every time i watched or listened to her or his narration respectively. I'm sure that anyone who falls in love will has the same feeling as they have in the movie. However, i also feel happy about they love each other and disappointed about it's a friction story only happening in movies. You still find it great funny there are some discrepancy between their views, for example the first time when they met.I am delighted to write down this reviews because i watched the movie with English script throughout instead of Chinese script.",Flipped

If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.",Flipped
172,dada1994,Let Down,4,26 February 2011,"As a big fan of the book, this movie was a major let down to me. I know movies can't include every detail of a book, but some scenes were changed in a way that removed all the emotion the book created. (When Chet told Bryce why his mother was crying and whenever he spoke to him it wasn't as if they never spoke.) When Bryce told him family about the chickens, instead of telling them he didn't actually ask Juli, he simply lied and let them think he did. The fact that the actual story doesn't take place in the late 1950s also makes it completely different. I disliked how Bryce only had lunch with one girl on the day of the auctions. I did not finish watching the movie, but as a person who enjoyed every word of the book, this movie was a major let down.Pros - Juli and Bryce narrating their sides of each story, good technologyCons - strayed away from book too much, Bryce's mom and sister looked too alike (I got them confused and I disliked his mother's hair), being set in a different time (I would understand '90s but '60s is too much).",Flipped

They come to understand some of the struggles that have come to rest with their families, and how their families are different, yet struck with unspoken challenges nonetheless. Each step of the way, they learn more and more to cherish friendship, family and love. Rob Reiner brings the story to life with charming leads, brushed with innocence.

176,GAStrachan,This is the first time Rob Reiner has ever truly let me down.,2,11 September 2010,"I didn't know anything about this book or movie when it appeared at my local cineplex, but some quick research showed me there were some quality people associated with it -- Aiden Quinn, John Mahoney, Anthony Edwards and, most especially, Rob Reiner. Reiner has made some of my favorite movies of all time and shown, perhaps, more diversity than any other director working today (could you get more different than This is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, A Few Good Men, and When Harry Met Sally?). At his best, his films are a home run, and even his worst films were solid base hits, but I guess everyone has to strike out once in a while.As I watched this story unfold in a very straight forward, obvious and uninteresting way, I struck by the uniformly poor acting from everyone (with the possible exception of Mahoney). Then it dawned on me -- it's not the acting, it's the characters. Each was a simple stereotype and barely even 2 dimensional. The actors were doing exactly what was being asked of them and the only fault I can really find with them is their poor choice in choosing this project in the first place. And the worst part of it is that the story itself was not that bad. It was just poorly executed.I have not given up on Rob Reiner as filmmaker. He has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment over the years. So I'm just going to try to put this clunker he phoned in out of my mind and will go back and watch The American President for the 20th time.",Flipped
177,jp_cpa_paradise,I care not on negative reviews,10,1 February 2012,"I really can't get those who rate this as rotten or awful. Seeing this movie brings back memories and I'm sure for all of you too. I really can't resist to smile every time Juli and Bryce have their talks.The movie was really great. Recommended for all ages.. Why all ages? Well you must all admit that you too experienced we had our first love way back years ago. How i wish life is still as light as before. Can you imagine the story happening on present year? Cellphones, emails, Facebook.. Surely the excitement factor will not be as great as compared to 60's 70's 80's or even early 90's...I'm rating this 9.9 out of 10... I just don't like that the kiss dint pursue... ha ha.....",Flipped
178,iralarry1,This is what movie making was invented for-Story telling.,10,16 April 2012,"I have been a fan or Rob Reiner since I was a kid watching All In The Family. There must be dozens of episodes I specifically recall Reiner in. This movie, Flipped, is exactly why I love the movies. A beautiful story told in a beautiful and emotionally memorable way. It was engrossing, well cast, excellently acted and marvelously directed. Reiner, as far as i am concerned hit it out of the park. A tender and anxious telling of early teen love from the perspective of both protagonists, young Julie and young Bryce. They live across from one another in suburbia and over time, redefine both their relationship and themselves in a scenario of self discovery and understanding.",Flipped
179,sanamsingh93,"a serene take on love, relations, and life. Not one to miss at any cost .",7,14 May 2012,"I was just surprised by this movie. It will engross you, make you feel excited, and leave you smiling and wanting more. The direction is beautiful. It brings a new style of narration, where the same story is told both by the male and the female leads, leaving us a contrast that is sure to be enjoyed.As for acting, the cast couldn't be more perfect. The child actors strive to impress. Me, being a John Mahoney fan, loved the movie all the more. Every scene, he's in, he'll help you stick a smile through out. Overall, its a must watch. My words! :)",Flipped
180,garima-cha,Coming of Age Couldn't make more Sense,8,10 June 2015,"A Beautiful, well written, impeccably acted and wonderfully directed movie. What makes it more charming is that it is based in the 1950s and the early 1960s, which adds a hint of class and drama to all the characters. There is a separate genre of coming of age movies, as how one finds him/herself under the various circumstances. But Flipped gives you more sense of things in not so obvious sense. It touches so many aspects of life and connects with you at so many level. The Story uses the teenagers as tools to give you an enlightenment on perspective, prejudice, character, Morality, Love and Life. The movie stays with you and will leave a smile every time you will hear the word ""Flipped"".",Flipped
181,baileycraig2014,Amazing Beautiful Tear Jerker,10,24 May 2013,"So few films can make my face shiny with tears by the first 15 minutes, I was expecting a cute little kid film. This was so much more, it was intellectual, witty, and it captured youthful beauty and the essence of what life should be. This film was captivating, the characters were played eloquently. I would highly recommend this to anyone of any age. Spectacularly done, the dark side of it appealed to greater audiences. This film moved from wistful youth, wise elders, and regretful adults. It is a movie that can flit you through a lifetime in an hour and a half. I personally cried throughout, it filled me with happiness watching it. This film is superb, a real gem. If you love witty, funny, and beautiful film this if defiantly one you need to see.",Flipped
182,duchoa22,The journey between two teens that fell in love.,7,25 November 2012,"*May Contain Spoilers* *May Contain Spoilers* *May Contain Spoilers**May Contain Spoilers**May Contain Spoilers**May Contain Spoilers* To start off, I would like to state that I am not a professional critic. I am just an ordinary person who LOVES classic romantic/ romantic comedy movies. Anyways, I rate this movie 7 out of 10 stars. As a lover of movies, I basically seen MOST romantic movies. This movie was some-what predictable, however, this movie provides an awesome warm spectacular feeling when you watch it. This movie consists of very good actors and screenplay. This movie was also unique on how it was presented. In the movie it shows the two perspectives of the two lovers and their interpretation of the same event. The event of both of them falling in love. I recommended this movie to the ages of 16 and older. However this movie can easily be recommended those younger. This movie can totally relate to you if you ever had your ""first"" love. :D",Flipped

But it has his negative side.We wont know close nothing about family members,of their life,thougths. Dad of the boy is so antipathic and wont know why?Why is he so sh*tface,Sorry but he is a real idiot.And you must hate it. So its good,amazing,but it could be better.

This movie was truly a breath of fresh air.",Flipped
185,aayush-mudgal,Flipped : A flipping love story,8,16 August 2014,"Flipped is a unique coming of age romantic comedy movie based on the novel ""Flipped"" by W. Draanen. The movie captures a beautiful transition and flip in nature of two second graders. It's a bit too Wonder Years at times, but the odd two-narrators gimmick plays right into the film's ""flip"" in structure.It's a surprising-engaging and beautifully-told story about young romance though being static for few moments in the middle. The story revolves around Bryce Loski and Juli Baker, young children who are brought together with the strong bond of love. Juli falls in love at first sight with Bryce who has a weird feeling of attraction and isn't too sure of his love for her. From the very first day he tries to keep her away, at times insulting her and letting her down, but she is never angered or agitated.. She repeatedly tries to forget his behavior, but it's when this stacks up so high, and she feels that she might be wrong for him that at this time, Bryce starts experiencing a deep sense of love and affection towards her. He repeatedly tries to contact her, talk to her, and makes all possible attempts and pleads her for forgiveness. But when she realizes that Bryce has redeemed himself, they both share a smile and continue and hold each other's hand. This flip of minds is beautifully portrayed in the movie.It's through their experiences that they get to know about themselves and about each other. Despite being opposite in all sense they both fall in love with each other.The importance of understanding varying perspectives is always worth communicating, and Flipped, despite its cloying approach, manages to deliver this idea with a decent amount of sincerity intact.If you want a ultimately feel-good film about young love, this is a movie to watch. !",Flipped
186,chaitiagrawal,Must Watch,9,29 April 2015,"""Flipped"" is an awesome movie. It is one of the best movies i have ever seen. The story is narrated in such a way that you can feel both side of the relationship. You can easily relate to the two characters Juli and Bryce. I liked the switching of points of views between Bryce and Juli. This gave the movie an extra niche. The kids and their parents both played their role excellently well. Each character played its own part in building the character of the two kids. The role played by John Mahoney was important and critical for the story too. This movie can be very touching . I would really recommend this movie as it has a great story and with astonishing narration. You will love the time spent watching this movie.",Flipped
187,vincejesus,Cute Fun Creative movie,9,25 May 2020,"This movie is fun to watch the character development and see different perspectives of the same key situations of life. Rob Reiner is a master story teller throughout the film. He knows how to make you laugh and to make you cry. This movie has both. It is so fun to relate to growing up, having crushes, and having courage to stand up for what is right.",Flipped
188,siropetto,The beauty comes from the simple story,10,3 January 2017,"It is not the first time I watch this movie, even I know I should write this review immediately when I first watch it. I also never write any movie review before.I feel the same no matter how many times I have watched it, even I remember every detail and every scene like the end when they realize they haven't had any actual conversation and the background music Let it be me starts. The director did really good job when combining the two main character's perspective. It is same as love in real life, we never know what the other people think and it confuses us and misled us. We did embarrassing things, we screwed things up. It is also brilliant to see how Bryce grown up, mentally to understand what his grandfather said : ""Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss...."" He turned to me. ""But every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare."" I was moved by this movie but it is not cliché. It is just because I find the beauty in the simplest thing, not in marvelous scenes, beautiful casts or significant story but in Flipped.",Flipped

This movie defines romance. This is what romance genre supposed to be. I don't know what's wrong with rating, not as famous as it is supposed to be but this movie must be watched by everyone who are willing to watch these sort of movies(teenage crush). After watching this became my favorite. All the cast acted very well. It becomes more attractive when the movie shows point of views by both girls and boys. Although,I haven't read the book neither do I want to I afraid I might disappointed. I look forward to watch more of these kind of beautiful movies.",Flipped
192,mdlcbfla,"Too melodramatic, maybe Reiner's worst",3,11 June 2011,"The premise had such promise, and the structure (alternating perspectives) was a great way to tell the story. I have to blame it on the director. There's no way this many halfway decent (or better) actors could turn in such superficial performances. The family yelling scenes are pathetically bad, no nuance at all, suited for film-making 30+ years ago. Everything the Anthony Edwards character does is cringe-worthy and over the top. Look at the gestures the characters make. It's like nothing was suggested to tone down the melodrama. Only Madeline Carroll shows exceptional acting ability, and even that is not consistent. Also, listen to the diction in the dialog. This was supposed to take place in the early 60s, but the words and phrases used are colloquial from today. It ends up being a cross between an After School Special and something on Lifetime. It's not unwatchable, but only as a last resort.",Flipped
193,tragedydq,"A heartwarming, simple, and lovely coming of age movie",8,30 November 2016,"First of all, I love this movie so much and I would like to appreciate Rob because he reminds me of my first love via this movie. The movie is processing with two main characters – Juli and Bryce. Juli is a very beautiful girl: Long chestnut hair, big green eyes, like a melted ice cream in the summer. However, she is pretty naughty. She is ready for a relationship when she is 7 and she even hit the newspaper's headline because of hampering her neighbors cutting the tree. She is entangled his new neighbor which is a little handsome boy Bryce. Bryce doesn't like to stay with Juli and so does his father Steven. Steven thinks Juli seems to be too animated and he hates Juli's father too! Steven thinks Richard is a jerk because of his ugly painting and ugly courtyard. In short, Juli's family is a freak in the neighborhood. With the age growing up. Juli and Bryce's life are slowly and subtly changing. Their views of the each other and also the world are changing too. In this process, Bryce's grandfather Chet plays an important character. He is the first guy to helps Bryce finds Juli's unique and helps Juli in obscurity. Moreover, the most interesting thing of the story is that the director uses the linear narrative mode, it also has a sub-mode of repetition and contrast. In this way, I can clearly feel the difference, contradictions, gaps between the boys and girls. It just sent me back to when I was young and reminding how much I avoided girls and how many tricks that I put on them.My favorite part of the film is the experiences of the main character's growth. Most of the coming of age genre movies are event driven not personality driven, the psychological changes and behavioral choices are often driven by some sudden events. However, Flipped describes the processing of the growing and maturing in the daily life. Juli doesn't love thinking since she was young. She realizes the beauty's difference of the appearance and the inherent when she pursuits the true beauty. Bryce also becomes a warrior from a cowardly kid step by step. Rob leads us to flip from Juli's view to Bryce's view to shows us the true nature of their friendship and love, their love and respect to each other and ends this story with a lovely and sweet ending. All in all, I enjoyed this movie and would like to recommend it!",Flipped

Just an impression i liked to share, not exactly a review.",8,25 December 2011,"Though it might sound another sensitive and light entertainment at first, it had been a joyful experience from beginning to end to me. Then again, I love and admire almost all of Rob Reiner's work. He achieves to imprint a soul to the story and their characters in his movies (rare to find in an American reel), blurring the gap I feel there is in the way of telling a story (regarding European approaches e.g.), and gets the best of both worlds with a true original. If I ever get into this business as I've been dreaming since my kid years', I would love to follow his example.My deepest thanks to his work, and very best wishes he keeps on making these worth watching films.",Flipped
