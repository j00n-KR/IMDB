0,bkoganbing,The Future Is Not in Rustbelt Pennsylvania,10,28 June 2007,"As Stefan Djeordjevic, Tom Cruise wants to move out of Ampipe, Pennsylvania as badly as George Bailey does from Bedford Falls. He plays football, but harbors no illusions about a career in that direction. The pros won't take anyone his size so he just wants to get to college to study engineering. His working class father and brother can't get him there and as a B student no academic scholarships are in the offing. Football really is his life.The difference between Bedford Falls and Ampipe is the difference between a rising and falling economy. If you remember in It's A Wonderful Life, George Bailey gets Sam Wainwright to re-open the old glass works for a plastics factory instead of locating in Rochester. There's a future in Bedford Falls, like there is none in the Eighties Ampipe where industry is relocating to the south and even out of the country. The future is definitely not in rust-belt Pennsylvania. Everybody wants out of that place except those with no future. Cruise's girlfriend Lea Thompson is jealous because as a band-member there ain't no scholarships for him. The coach Craig T. Nelson wants a winning season so he can get a prize college coaching job. All his other players have ambitions like Cruise.All the Right Moves was Tom Cruise's sixth film and first dramatic lead, it's the film that made him a star. He was first billed in Losin' It and Risky Business, but this one showed what a good actor he was. If it wasn't for All the Right Moves, Tom Cruise's career would have faded with the eighties. Lea Thompson gives good support to Tom and Craig T. Nelson is far from the coach that we see in Coach. He's a bitter driven man and not happy when some in the town toilet paper his house after a loss and he sees Cruise on the scene.Paul Carafotes and Christopher Penn are a couple of other football players whose lives take an abrupt change in direction by other reasons than football. Best supporting player in the film though is James Battico who's stayed all his life in Ampipe. He turns out to be a malevolent creep, very similar to Robert DeNiro in This Boy's Life.Ampipe stands for American Pipe&Steel. The town, the high school is named it. But the very name I'm sure gives rise to other less flattering nicknames that I'm sure anyone reading this will come up with.All the Right Moves is one of the best coming of age films ever made and should never be missed when broadcast.",All the Right Moves
1,SnoopyStyle,teenage desperation,6,20 August 2015,"Stef Djordjevic (Tom Cruise) lives in poor Pennsylvanian town Ampipe, a company town for American Pipe & Steel. He is the high school football star defensive back. He has his girlfriend Lisa Lietzke (Lea Thompson) and dreams of a college engineering scholarship. After a lost, Stef fights with Coach Nickerson (Craig T. Nelson) and is kicked off the team. Nickerson's home is vandalized and the coach blames Stef. Stef finds himself blacklisted from colleges. His friend Brian (Chris Penn) is forced to marry his pregnant girlfriend. The mill lays off his brother and he's desperate to escape the town.It's a very traditional small town kid struggles. Tom Cruise makes it better than its simple premise. He's full of himself and full of angst. It's also interesting that Craig T. Nelson isn't a simple character. Lea Thompson probably plays the most endearing and compelling character. Her talk with Mrs. Nickerson is fascinating. The teenage desperation is palpable although some of it is bad cliché. It reminds me a little of 'Friday Night Lights' but nowhere near as good.",All the Right Moves
2,lee_eisenberg,"Like they said in ""Scream"": if you pause it just right...",7,2 May 2006,"OK, so there have been many movies about someone struggling against seemingly insurmountable odds to make something of him/herself. In this case, Tom Cruise plays a Pennsylvania teenager hoping to get a football scholarship. He does a respectable job with the role, considering that it's really nothing that we haven't seen before. What makes this movie really good is that it shows how the company that employs the men in town is laying everyone off, so people are having to look for opportunities elsewhere.All in all, this is a pretty good movie. I've always thought that Tom Cruise was better in his earlier roles than in his later ones. Also starring Craig T. Nelson, Lea Thompson and Chris Penn.I have to admit that I learned about ""All the Right Moves"" from ""Scream"". You may recall the line about pausing the movie just right, and what you can see as a result.",All the Right Moves
3,Woodyanders,Touching small town drama,8,9 January 2009,"Eager and ambitious high school football player Stefan Djordjevic (an excellent Tom Cruise in an early lead role) desperately wants to leave his dreary Pennsylvania home town, but needs a sports scholarship in order to get into college. Problems arise when Stefan locks horns with the hard-nosed Coach Nickerson (superbly played to the steely hilt by Craig T. Nelson), who also aspires to getting out of the dying rustbelt community. Director Michael Chapman and screenwriter Michael Kane deliver a compelling and authentic slice of working class American life with an especially strong and naturalistic grasp of the everyday people with dreams and desires to make something out of their lives. Moreover, the bleak and hopeless blue collar atmosphere is quite nicely evoked by Jan de Bont's gritty cinematography and the grimy eastern Pennsylvania locations. Cruise brings a winning blend of courage and vulnerability to his role. Lea Thompson contributes a lovely and affecting performance as Stefan's sweet, selfless and supportive musician girlfriend Lisa (their love scene in particular is very tender and touching). Plus there are sturdy supporting turns by Charles Cioffi as Stefan's proud father, Chris Penn as lovable lug Brian, Paul Carafotes as the hot-headed Vinnie Salvucci, Gary Graham as Stef's weary older brother Greg, and James A. Baffico as arrogant blowhard Bosko. Longtime favorite character actors Dick Miller and Terry O'Quinn appear briefly in nifty minor parts. A solid and moving little film.",All the Right Moves
4,rmax304823,He Gets to See California.,5,19 November 2009,"I was about ready to log off on this movie by the end of the first half hour or so. A teen movie that takes it characters and values seriously. The coach of a high school football team, Craig Nelson, in western Pennsylvania must lead the team to victory to land a better job. Tom Cruise, the star of the team, needs to finish high school with an unblemished record in order to win a football scholarship to college and leave Ampipe. (That's the name of the industrial Appalachian town -- Ampipe, as in American Pipe and Steel Company.) Oh, there are all sorts of conflicts. The coach has no tolerance for failure. He calls it quitting. And he thinks in nominal scales -- you're either with the team or against it. And he really believes this crap. And Tom Cruise has an attitude problem. He loses his cool when he's angry and shouts impulsively when he should be keeping his mouth shut.Then there is Cruise's girl, Lea Thompson, a tiny thing who loves Cruise as much as he loves her. But they have a problem too. She believes that if Cruise leaves high school for a distant college, while she is still a junior with another year to go, she'll lose him to someone else. Further, she's envious of Cruise's chances of getting a football scholarship while she, a musician, has little such hope.I said the coach believes the stuff he shouts to the team in the locker room and he really does. He gives pep talks about quitters being losers and we're all in this together. The context of these scenes seems to encourage the audience to accept this adolescent nonsense. And when Cruise's father is in a bar and someone spits in his face that, ""Your son cost us the game!"", and the old man pops the impudent natterer in the nose, we are clearly meant to cheer the petty violence.But then, the second half of the movie, while still groveling in corn, gets a little more interesting. Some sympathy is extended to the coach -- I won't bother describing it in detail -- when his house is trashed. Cruise who was peripheral to the incident apologizes but the coach has him pegged as a quitter and fires him from the team, causing a blemish to appear on Cruise's heretofore spotless record, and jeopardizing his chances of being awarded the scholarship that will free him from the hellish community he's part of.And what a dreary place it is. The drizzly weather, the shabby wooden tenements, the Gothic woods, the dripping hills, hover over the whole movie like a leaden cloud. You can practically smell the dismal rooms and trailers. See ""Slap Shot"" or ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" for other examples. Give me the studio-built, fairy-tale Appalachia of Howard Hawks' ""Sergeant York"" any day.The performances are neither outstandingly bad or unusually good. Lea Thompson is appealing enough with her girlish voice. Tom Cruise still has that piping high-schoolish voice and spends a good deal of time standing around open mouthed. Craig Nelson has the kind of presence that ought to lend itself to high morality or terpitude but the default position of his features is a simple frown. He's never able to get past that frown.Enough. Everything in it is predictable, including the happy ending. The coach is offered a job at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo and offers Cruise a scholarship there. I don't know how a newly hired football coach can offer anybody a scholarship, but there it is. The old fixeroo is in. You know, I'm not sure whether the coach was hired at Cal Tech or Cal Poly. Can't remember exactly. I hope it was Cal Poly because the campus is situated in such a pretty area -- the coast of central California -- and they have a marvelously comprehensive library. I managed to locate a book of mine in the card catalogue. Yes, a nice place.",All the Right Moves
5,blanche-2,When getting out is all that matters,7,2 August 2005,"A younger, different looking Tom Cruise (old jaw/nose?) stars in this movie about a high school student aching to leave his dying steel mill town and study to be an engineer on a football scholarship. He watches his best friend, also on the team, marry his pregnant girlfriend; another member of the football team is arrested for armed robbery; his brother gets laid off from the mill; and his girlfriend (a young, fresh Lea Thompson) complains that no one gives music scholarships, just football ones, and she's going to be stuck in the town. After turning down initial scholarship offers to middle of the road schools, Cruise finds himself blackballed after an incident at his coach's house with which he was only peripherally involved. Off the team, and with the word out that he has an ""attitude problem,"" he sees his dreams turning to dust.Craig T. Nelson plays the coach and does his usual fine job, and Lea Thompson is a vibrant, passionate Lisa. Cruise here gives a truer performance than usual - I usually find him a very external and not terribly believable actor. In ""All The Right Moves,"" he's sympathetic and heartfelt. I much prefer this to the perfectly handsome, glossy figure he is today. Time to get back to basics, Tom, and get some of those right moves back.",All the Right Moves
6,edwagreen,All the Right Moves- A Jock Movie that Works ***1/2,9,14 October 2009,"Another part made for Tom Cruise, the young jock with aspirations for college to pursue a career in engineering. He needs to win the football scholarship to attain his dream. Otherwise, he will be locked into that Pennsylvania steel-mining town. While this is a familiar theme in films, it works well here thanks to the presence of Cruise and Lea Thompson, his young girlfriend who wants to pursue a career in music.Craig T. Nelson really steals the film in a part that he has relished playing-that high school coach!After losing a heartbreak, Cruise loses it and in one brief moment after drinking, he does something that can adversely affect his changes for college and his career.This is basically a story of people who want out of this hum-drum existence and aspire to better things. It is also a story of redemption and ultimate fulfillment of your life's dream. It is masterfully done.",All the Right Moves
7,wes-connors,Cruise Control,5,1 November 2009,"""The only way football star Stefen Djordjevic (Tom Cruise) will avoid a life in the blast furnaces of his bleak Pennsylvania hometown is by winning a college scholarship. Even his coach (Craig T. Nelson) dreams of parlaying a winning team into a college job far away from this graveyard of the American Dream. But it's not long before the two virtually ruin each other's chances for escape and their door to the future starts to close. Lea Thompson and Christopher Penn co-star,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Mr. Cruise is back in high school, after his successful ""Risky Business"" - still playing at a theater near you! in 1983. Cruise looks the part of a bulked-up football player. He and Ms. Thompson (as Lisa Litski) have a sexy nude scene. The supporting cast, including skinny Chris Penn (as Brian), perform noticeably well. And, it's nice to see Gary (""Alien Nation"") Graham in an early role. The story is mildly engrossing. How Paul Carafotes (as Vinnie Salvucci) made his desk rise, in those tight jeans, is debatable.***** All the Right Moves (10/21/83) Michael Chapman ~ Tom Cruise, Craig T. Nelson, Lea Thompson, Chris Penn",All the Right Moves
8,sunwarrior13,A Good Blue Collar Film,6,7 October 2011,"All The Right Moves is a film about a headstrong high school football star of Ampipe High,Stefen Djordjevic,who dreams of getting out of his small Western Pennsylvania steel town with a college football scholarship. It also results with a head-on collision with his ambitious coach,Coach Nikerson,who also aspires for a college position, resulting in a conflict between them.Definitely,it was one of the better blue collar films made in the 1980's.Djordjevic,played by Tom Cruise in his first dramatic starring film,is a high school defensive back seeking a college football scholarship to free himself from the economic hardship that small Pennsylvania town of Ampipe,a town struggling through the downturn of the recession of the 1980's.While Ampipe High appears headed to win the game,a fumbled play in the closing seconds leads to a Walnut Heights victory.After the game, Coach Nickerson,played by Craig T. Nelson, lambastes the fumbler in the locker room, telling him to quit the team. When Stefen retorts that the coach himself quit, the coach kicks him off the team.After the game,some angry Ampipe fans vandalize Coach Nickerson's residence. Stefen is present and is a reluctant participant, but is nonetheless seen by Nickerson as the vandals flee. From there,Stefen deals with personal battles,including dealing with the coach who bans him among colleges because of his attitude and his relationship with his girlfriend,Lisa,played excellently by Lea Thompson.Stefen,frustrated by his current situation,confronts his former coach and his girlfriend whom he has set aside as his aspirations of getting out of Ampipe has become a big part of his life.At the end of the movie, Nickerson,with the help of Lisa,realizes he was wrong and offers Stefen a college scholarship for playing football at CalPoly where he works on a college position,which he accepts.The movie was simple and ordinary.The story was predictable.What stands out is the acting of Cruise,Thompson and Nelson.The direction of Michael Chapman was also commendable. Also,the movie has great original songs namely: ""All The Right Moves"";""The Last Stand"";""This Could Our Last Chance""; and ""Blue Skies Forever"".Overall,the film was good but not great.Highly recommended for people who loves Tom Cruise and Back To The Future star,Lea Thompson as well as people who wants to reminisce their great memories of High School.",All the Right Moves
9,ThomasDrufke,Doesn't Really Know What it Wants to Be,5,6 September 2016,"Sports movies are often stuck in the same old clichéd formula, but more often than not, they work. To All the Right Moves credit, it doesn't follow that winning formula, but it also doesn't necessarily create its own well-strung story.In one of his first acting roles, Tom Cruise stars alongside Craig T. Nelson and Lea Thompson as his coach and girlfriend respectively. If for nothing else, this film is worth a watch just for those performances alone. Cruise and Thompson prove to be fearless in their risqué high school roles, and Nelson plays a great antagonist and obstacle for Cruise's 'Stefen' character. I can't speak too highly on the film itself, but those performances are certainly worth 90 minutes of your time.The biggest issue with All the Right Moves is that it actually tries to make too many 'moves' with its story, pun intended. It doesn't really know what it wants to be. On one hand, it's a nice coming of age story with Thompson and Cruise. The next it's an intense football drama between two schools. Or even a film that tackles the heavy themes of class struggle and sexuality, just to name a few. There's just no real focus here. The minute you start to get invested with what Nelson's team is doing, led by Cruise among others, it changes its course to another plot point entirely. I appreciate the film's intentions, it just didn't hit home the ideas that it set out to, and it suffers because of that.What I can say is that this film was probably more of a product of its time. The soundtrack is blatantly filled with slow and smooth 80's tracks that can be distracting. The sound editing as a whole is pretty poor. The football sequences are borderline amateur. And some of the plot points have been done much better in more recent years. Sure, that's not the film's fault, but it does hinder its re-watchability to an extent. It's fun to watch a young Cruise and Thompson share great chemistry, but there's not a lot beneath that.+Cruise shows promise+Attempts to explore deep themes-But fails at most of them-Misguided direction56/100",All the Right Moves
10,slightlymad22,"Watchable, But Nothing More",6,14 September 2017,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to to his third and final movie of 1983, All The Right Moves.Plot In A Paragraph: A high school football player (Cruise) desperate for a scholarship and his headstrong coach clash in a dying Pennsylvania steel town.Like with Risky Business, this is another movie that I don't get people's love for. I find it watchable, and nothing more. Cruise is OK, everyone's favourite TV coach, Craig T Nelson is his usual reliable self, and Leah Thompson (who shares the most unsexy and uncomfortable life scene I have ever witnessed) looks cute, but doesn't really bring much. One plus is, it has a decent rock soundtrack, which is usually listed first in the end credits with each song stating what scene it was played it. This was the first movie Tom Cruise's name appeared above the movie title on a poster.All The Right Moves grossed $17 million at the domestic box office, to end the year the 42nd highest grossing movie of 1983.",All the Right Moves
11,Dr_Coulardeau,Slightly too moralistic,7,27 April 2014,"Curiosity may kill the cat but it does not kill nostalgia. To discover today this thirty year old film with a Tom Cruise who must have been hardly out of his teens at the time is funny but interesting to know what an important actor today was at the beginning of his career. You may recognize some of his facial and attitudinal ticks but he sure was young.The film itself is nothing to brag about. A High School football film again. Stef is a promising football player who could easily get a football scholarship in any college or nearly, if he could finish his senior year on the football team and even take the team to a victory.He does not because he makes a mistake he had been warned about several times on the last game he plays (the last but one of the season). In fact his team loses the game because he attacks a player who had the ball after he had passed the ball away. He was attacking the man instead of following the ball. Penalty and the game is lost. The coach is furious of course after the game but Stef is aggressive and in fact attacks the coach and makes him responsible. From this point to the catastrophe there was only one step and Stef crossed it. He is dropped from the team. Then he has to walk home, quite a good distance. So he thumbs a lift and is picked by a band of loafers from his city who decide to go spoil and soil the home of the coach and his cars. They manage to get Stef along and he is considered as responsible for it.He is dropped from all prospective colleges. Since he is from a steel industry city in Pennsylvania, he has no future except working at the mill. The film is supposed to teach us a lesson, just the way it does to Stef: apologize and forgive, but that's hard when you were wrong in the first place, though it is also hard when you get even with someone who is wrong by being wrong yourself, i.e. not forgiving and/or not apologizing. At the same time apologizing and forgiving may become a sort of encouragement to other people to go on being obnoxious. Life at times cannot go without some strife and tension and people have to learn to step over it and just put it behind. But fear comes back into the picture. When you are afraid of life you tend to look back behind yourself and then you cannot put the past behind. If you try too hard it might backfire, at least in your dreams.The myth in the film is that such strife and tension is typically masculine and it takes women to soften the situation: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and the medicine goes down. Really? I am sure I will trip my foot in the carpet if I tried that magic potion.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",All the Right Moves
12,helpless_dancer,rah rah rah blah blah blah,5,14 February 2004,"While this wasn't a throwaway it didn't garner any extra points with me either. Most of the characters aggravated me to no end; the little girls who were 'in love', the jock who impregnates his girlfriend[read: slut]and then blathers 'it is what I really want'[this pea brain has no clue to what he 'wants'], the stupid townies who go ape over their team getting the big win, and the typical 'coach'[read: sadistic dumbass] whose sole objective is winning, winning, winning.

13,MarieGabrielle,"My brother, (now a surgeon) envied Tom Cruise....",10,10 September 2006,"I will also add that that is not the case now....Be things as they are, when this film was made it showed a good side of Tom Cruise; neighborhood kid trying to get ahead- no guidance from his father; no trust fund or relatives to give him a hand.It is somewhat sad to watch this film, or ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (an excellent film, also) and be misguided by PR trash magazines and gossip. When he was younger, Tom Cruise deserved credit as an actor. I myself would like to write purely about film, but it is sad that, in the U.S. the rumor mills spread gossip and hatred to all areas; suffice it to say, this film has a good story, and Cruise was not as famous at the time, so it is well worth watching. 10/10.",All the Right Moves
14,questl-18592,All the Same Moves,4,31 December 2020,"Holy Generic Sports Movie, Batman!There's really not much to be said about this because everything in here has been done a million times before and honestly been done better. This just happens to exist. What makes me drop it to just below average is the ending. It nearly had something there, it nearly showed us the rarest of things, a sports movie that ends on a super depressing note about someone being churned up by the system and just tossed aside. I would have LOVED that! But nope! At the last minute we have to pull some nonsense to make sure everyone gets their perfect fairytale ending. Nope. Hard pass.While this isn't awful, there is nothing here that's worth the time to watch it. If you're already watching something and this just happened to come on after it and you're too lazy to change the channel (not knocking it, I've seen a few movies that way) then sure I guess but that is the only reason anyone should waste time on something this generic.",All the Right Moves
15,p-stepien,A few turnovers too many,5,28 September 2012,"In small Polaco-dominated town Ampipe the mill is the only stable source of income, now increasingly struggling due to the industrial crisis rumbling through America. Most teens dream of leaving the town - one way or the other. The non-Polish named, but Polish speaking Stefan Djeordjevic (Tom Cruise) is a star player in the local football team, one coached by the inspirational, crafty but simultaneously overly demanding Nickerson (Craig T. Nelson). Stefan dreams of a football scholarship and has placed all his hopes on one key game against the unbeaten team of the division. Backed by his girlfriend Lisa (Lea Thompson) nothing can go wrong...A curious case of a much entertaining drama, which registers several touchdowns in the first period, only to give the ball away later on and then unforgivably flopping in the dying seconds, much like on the key play of the movie. Tom Cruise has magnetic presence and wallops his charm throughout, showcasing why he was soon lifter to fame. Despite that the dramatic build-up about the hopelessness of such small-time community life, fails to direct its attention to a more thoughtful resolution, instead delivering a sequence of gimmicky clichés to deliver a happy ending (especially one laden with non-sensical plot jumps featuring a fired factory worker happily going about his job several scenes after being ditched). In hindsight an promising premise gone astray and ultimately reeping benfits off of Cruise's charm, not cognitive content or coherence.",All the Right Moves
16,PredragReviews,"""Scholarship here, no scholarship here, who the hell gave you that power?""",7,16 October 2016,"This is a very coming-of-age movie and focuses a lot on teenagers and issues that they have to deal with as well as on people, who are ""stuck"" living in small towns or poor areas with limited future prospects. Stef, played by Tom Cruise, has to perform well in football games, impress scouts from universities, and deal with his loving girlfriend Lisa. Other minor characters in the movie are teammate Brian, who unintentionally impregnates his girlfriend which destroys his plan to attend USC on a football scholarship, and Vinny Salvucci, who gets involved in crime and winds up behind bars. The plot peaks in the movie when Stef gets into a conflict with his coach, who, as a result, uses his influence to discourage other colleges from offering Stef any scholarships. Can Stef still make it out of the dying mill town via a scholarship or will he be stuck in a factory for the rest of his life? ""All the Right Moves"" proves that Tom Cruise had tremendous screen presence from the very beginning. His scenes with Nelson and Thompson provide dazzling hints of greater things still to come. Nelson, who may be better known for his comedic side, turns in an especially strong supporting performance as the coach who is both Stefan's tormentor and supporter at the same time. The story of the small-town kid dreaming to escape his surroundings for better things has been told so many times on television and film in so many different ways that it would be easy to dismiss ""All the Right Moves"" as just another tired re-telling. However, a familiar story is still engaging if told well and this film is proof of that.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",All the Right Moves
17,Sandcooler,Knows highs nor lows,5,28 June 2009,"The most noteworthy thing about this movie, and probably the only reason why it's still around, is that it has Tom Cruise in one of his earliest starring roles. Aside from that, there isn't really much to it. It's not bad I guess, but it's just all so plain and mediocre except for some of the acting. This script is one of the most predictable things ever written and just hums by with no surprises of any sort. You can't bring a lot of variation within the formula of a small town drama, but for the love of God, try a little. Often it just really needs to get to the point, because things get pretty boring if you already know the ending an hour beforehand. The raw, realistic filming style of the movie is in fact pretty good and really expresses desperation, but it just doesn't make the story any more interesting. As far as very young Tom Cruise goes, it's ""Risky Business"" all the way.",All the Right Moves
18,DunnDeeDaGreat,Varisty Blues 1983,8,26 October 2001,All The Right Moves is basically just like Varisty Blues. The only difference is it's set in a steel town. All the players are trying to get into good schools and the coach is an a**hole. Tom Cruise is great in the lead role and the football scenes are great.,All the Right Moves
19,hall895,Very few of the right moves,4,27 June 2005,"Nothing here you haven't already seen many times before. All the Right Moves is one big cliché from beginning to end. The small mill town where nobody ever amounts to anything. The high school football team that the townspeople take much too seriously. The kid who sees football as his only way out. The girlfriend who is not appreciated because, well, she doesn't play football and nobody in this town cares about anything besides football. The big game that the team just has to win. The setbacks before that big game that will make it much harder for them to do so. The conflict between players and their coach. Secondary characters (but not our hero heaven forbid) making terrible decisions which will destroy their future. The problem our hero faces and the inevitable way that problem will be dealt with. If you can't see very early on how all this is going to turn out, well you obviously haven't seen too many movies. This is about as predictable as movies get.About the only thing which makes this film even remotely noteworthy are the actors playing the key roles. Tom Cruise is the young football star, Craig T. Nelson his coach and Lea Thompson his girlfriend. Cruise, Nelson and Thompson were obviously destined for bigger and better things. Here, their performances are all fine, with the more seasoned Nelson unsurprisingly being the most convincing. Cruise and Thompson have a rather awkward romance (capped by a rather awkward love scene) but as they're playing young, naive high school kids the awkwardness actually seems to fit. Unfortunately though in the grand scheme of things the actors really don't have much to work with. The characters are unoriginal and clichéd. The story is one we've seen in various incarnations many times before. There's really nothing of note to keep your attention. And the whole thing comes with a sense of inevitability to it that lessens the sense of drama one might otherwise feel. This one will not live long in the memory.",All the Right Moves
20,khanbaliq2,An unexpectedly moving drama which got lost among the sugar-coated teen trifles of its time.,7,7 February 2018,"I've got to say that I'm not fully satisfied with my video about the best teen movies of the 1980s. There are at least two movies that I should have included. They are Footloose (1984) and All The Right Moves (1983). I myself wouldn't call Footloose an '80s classic, but it's still good enough to have made it to my list, though it wouldn't have been in the top 20. Footloose is an epic story about one teen's struggle to... dance and listen to pop music in some American backwater town. Footloose does have a good soundtrack, which is one of my favorite soundtracks of the 1980s. The movie itself isn't bad, and it has some good performances, but it's the soundtrack that I really like. The one movie that definitely should have made it to my list is All The Right Moves, which is easily one of the better teen movies of the 1980s. Unfortunately, I somehow forgot about this movie while I was making my list. What a bummer. First of all, there are good performances from Tom Cruise, Lea Thompson, and Craig T. Nelson. But every performance in this movie is solid. Then there's a good story with a message, which is actually not an uncommon message in Hollywood movies. No matter how hard life gets in the US of A, you can still pull through and triumph if you really try. Well, you can believe that if you want to. Unfortunately, there are a few things that, for me, weigh down this commendable, realistic look at life. One is the presence of sex jokes. The other is the presence of American football. The sex jokes kind of cheapen this otherwise good movie, and I've never been a fan of American football. These two things are staples in many other American teen movies. By the way, All The Right Moves was available on Netflix for a while, but it later disappeared.Now, let's get to my thoughts about Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I have not seen this movie, and I'm not planning on seeing it because I learned my lesson after seeing Star Wars: The Force Awakens. But the controversy surrounding this movie is quite interesting. Of course, as I predicted, The Last Jedi, while not being a good movie, got showered with praise by paid movie critics, just like the awful The Force Awakens was showered with praise. Many ordinary and honest people, however, said that The Last Jedi is even worse than The Force Awakens and that it ruins the legacy of Star Wars. Some grown men even said that it made them cry because they had to sit and watch their favorite franchise being ruined by Rian Johnson and Disney. In other words, the peasants rebelled. It seems that not all Americans are brainless consumers yet, as the people at Disney may have thought. The Disney propaganda machine and its buddies in the media and on the internet decided to fight the backlash. Numerous articles began to be released online claiming that the people that don't like The Last Jedi are either obsessed fans or grown men who live in their mothers' basements. Even more favorable reviews of The Last Jedi by Disney's buddies and army of paid critics appeared as well, claiming that The Last Jedi, though certainly not being a good movie, is still kind of original and that it tries something new. But, wait a minute! Didn't the people at Disney say that these new Star Wars movies are for the ""fans""? Now, all of a sudden, they're saying that these fans are annoying crybabies and that the movies are really for children (because children often don't care about the quality of movies and because the propaganda in Disney movies is meant to influence children). But Disney and its numerous partners in crime are going even further. The popular website Rotten Tomatoes has recently announced that it won't tolerate users who are intentionally voting down Disney movies because of their anger with The Last Jedi. The reviews and ratings of such users will be removed from the website. Criticism of the Disney monopoly and its bad movies will not be tolerated. In addition, the popular website IMDb recently changed the way user reviews can be viewed. Yes, you no longer have the option of which reviews you want to read, be they old or recent, negative or positive. Now all reviews are in only one section and only the most popular reviews can be viewed easily on the website. Still, even this measure didn't prevent the fact that user reviews of the The Last Jedi on IMDb are almost all negative. But let's not forget about Google (the owner of YouTube), which is another popular American website that's heavily involved in censorship online. Try finding a negative review of The Last Jedi by using the Google search engine. You'll have a very hard time doing this because only reviews that praise The Last Jedi are easily found on Google. Honest reviews by ordinary people are intentionally pushed back. You can still find such reviews, but it'll take some time and effort.It's worth pointing out that I'm not a hater of Disney or of the messages in its movies. I wisely didn't even go and see The Last Jedi in a theater because, as I've mentioned, I learned my lesson after seeing The Force Awakens. I didn't see The Last Jedi simply because it's a bad movie. But what Disney has been doing (releasing unoriginal remakes of beloved movies and crushing dissent) is biting. But this sort of behavior is typical in the USA. Of course, Disney isn't the only Hollywood studio that's releasing bad and unoriginal movies nowadays. What still surprises me sometimes is that some people still think that The Force Awakens is a good movie, though they didn't like The Last Jedi because of its obvious flaws. Well, this just shows that not everyone is rational and informed. Many people are mindless consumers who just want to watch CGI and explosions on the big screen. My younger sister, for example, is such a person. I'm sometimes stricken by the irrational things that she says. And, yes, she does own an iPhone, like many other mindless consumers. Well, such are the people that are being brought up by the capitalist system. They don't question the system or the authorities, and they live for mindless entertainment and consumption. That's why those awful Transformers movies directed by Michael Bay made hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office.",All the Right Moves

It moves along at a good pace, it does a good job of focusing on a few flawed, but reasonably likable characters, and the story has a feel-good ending.  Unfortunately, I was never really able to get into this movie.  One of the bigger problems is the entirely predictable ending, and so I spent much of the film just waiting for the inevitable reconciliations and the bright futures for all of the main characters.

23,Isaac5855,Cruise proves to be more than a flash in the pan...,7,5 April 2007,"Tom Cruise followed up his smashing success in the classic RISKY BUSINESS with ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, a quiet and moving drama in which Cruise plays Stefan Djordjevic, a somewhat sexist and dim-witted high school senior whose convinced that his prowess on the football field will allow him to go to college anywhere he wants, providing a one-way ticket out of the tiny, sleepy mining town where he lives where the entire town attends every game. Stefan's college plans get derailed when, after a confrontation with his coach (Craig T. Nelson), Stefan gets thrown off the team and the coach has him blackballed to the point where no college will talk to him. Cruise's interpretation of Jorjevich is quietly impressive because this character is nothing like Joel Goodson, his character in RISKY BUSINESS. Stefan is cocky, sexist, self-absorbed, and not terribly likable, but Cruise still manages to infuse the character with sympathy. Nelson is solid as the coach (nothing like his TV coach)and strong support is also provided by Lea Thompson as Stefan's girlfriend, the late Christopher Penn as Stefan's buddy who has to give up his football aspirations when he gets his girlfriend pregnant, Charles Cioffi as Stefan's dad and especially Paul Carafotes as Stefan's explosive buddy, ""The Vooch"". Nothing earth-shattering here, but it did prove that Cruise had the range to play different kinds of character.",All the Right Moves
24,romanorum1,Those Steel Mills Are Largely Gone Now,6,9 May 2016,"Ampipe (Johnstown, PA), a depressed and gritty steel town located just outside of Pittsburgh is in obvious decline. It had been founded long before by Ampipe Pipe and Steel when steel was big. In the old days young men left high school, acquired a job at the mill, married, fathered children, and bought a house while they were still young. Most of the local men still work at Ampipe, but layoffs are increasing. Enter Stef Djordjevic (Tom Cruise), a cornerback for his Ampipe High School football team (The Bulldogs), who wants a college scholarship to an engineering college, his ticket out of town. He displays his Penn State pennant on his bedroom wall. Stef resides with his father (Charles Cioffi) and older brother, Rick (Gary Graham), both of whom work in the mill.Stef doesn't always act in a nice way but is generally likable. His problem is his attitude, which drives his Coach, Nickerson (Craig T. Nelson), mad as a hatter. Stef does not always listen to his coach's teachings. Stef maintains a B average at Ampipe High, not good enough for a college scholarship. So he needs football as his meal ticket. Stef happens to be a very good defensive player, although he is not the star of his team. Meanwhile Coach Nickerson too is looking for a way out of Ampipe, as he has a chance to become defensive backfield coach at Cal Poly. The coach is tough and no-nonsense, and really works his players hard during the practices. He is less than perfect, and when players make mistakes, he considers them as quitters on the team.Even though the movie revolves around high school football, it is more about inter-personal relationships than about the gridiron. In fact, the big game against the Knights of Walnut Heights, a richer school undefeated and ranked number three in Pennsylvania, occurs only half-way through the movie, not at the denouement. And yet an interesting well-filmed piece does involve the road game: the long bus journey to Walnut Heights with the players thinking their individual thoughts, the tensions in the locker room, the pre-game prep talk, the long spiral football spinning through the air, the hard hits and grunts in the rain, and the eventual heartbreaking loss.Nevertheless, the important matter is the story of life, as when the two teen-aged protagonists (Stef and Lisa, Lea Thompson) finally get around to expressing their true feelings. Secondary characters have their stories to tell. There are the men, laid off from work, who drown their sorrows in the local gin mill. One young man in financial difficulty becomes desperate enough to commit a robbery. A life-changing event involves a cheerleader who becomes pregnant. Then there are the antics of a bar room bully. Stef himself becomes tense as his expected football scholarships fail to materialize.In summary the plot is decent, and even though the movie is not a great one, is still worth watching.",All the Right Moves

27,dansview,Worthwhile Elements,7,12 September 2012,"Please remember that a film doesn't have to be perfect, or even close, to be worthwhile. If it contains some interesting and memorable elements, than it has lasting value. Having said that, let me address this one, and refute some of the accusations of ""cliché."" Let's start with the setting. The opening sequence around town, and the football practice scenes, portray a combination of gritty urban reality and unrefined sylvan ambiance, with remarkable effectiveness. Interestingly, I don't necessarily think that living in a small, woodsy town, having close family and friends, and working with your hands, is such a terrible fate. If your mill closes down, there are other towns within commutable distance, to work in. What if this movie was set in the Spring? Maybe that part of the country is lovely in Spring. So we are shown the region with a slanted spin, as it is set in the Fall. I lived in a depressed logging town at about the time of this movie, but the difference is that it was totally isolated. Conversely, Ampipe, the town in this movie, is not far from Pittsburgh and its' suburbs. Nevertheless, I get the basic depressed vibe, and I'm sure it existed. Tom Cruise brought heart to this role. There's a scene where he is no longer the cocky jock, but rather simply a boy, in need of a mother, and seeking refuge in the reassuring arms of his father. What a uniquely gentle moment for a film about a high school football player. There was nothing cliché about it, and Cruise pulled it off with savvy. For the record, no one is ""stuck"" in any town in America. What about Junior College, what about just moving to a bigger town? So of course I don't buy the clichéd ""stuck in this town without a way out"" theme entirely. The gentility of the young couple's sex scene, where they lose their virginity is not clichéd. It is tasteful, sensitive, and totally believable. Tom Cruise's character looks a bit scared, in awe, and very conscious of the significance of the moment. Again, beautifully played. Lea Thompson is lovely in this film, and does a masterful job of portraying a teen in love. She sees that her boyfriend is self-centered, but she has the sixth sense of a small town girlfriend, that helps her see his the finer aspects of his character. We used to rely on real ""girls"" to provide balance in society, and bring out the best in a man. The music is simply great. ""All The Right Moves,"" and ""Blue Skies Forever,"" are 80s gems, and convey the optimism of a unique cultural time period. There are two apology scenes by men, that are done nicely, and with simple conviction. It's fresh to see men say they are sorry, and to really mean it. Cruise's best scene involves confronting his stubborn football coach in an alley and intermittently sprinting away, while throwing his hands up in confounded ire. Beautifully executed. He has talent, and perhaps should have pursued more gritty underdog roles than he has. What I loved best, was the portrayal of the mixture of hope, potential, vitality, sexuality, and angst that color one's last two years of high school. To be an upperclassman, athletic, in love, invincible, and free.",All the Right Moves
28,rlcsljo,Mostly dreary athletic drama with a few bright performances,6,10 September 2002,"The events leading up to the ""big game"" captured the spirit of heightened expectations more than any other athletic movie I have ever seen (The cheerleading sequence at the pep rally may have been the best ever filmed!). But after the game, the director did not seem to be able to handle the inter-personal relationships very well and I just kept saying to myself: ""When are they going to do a story on those outstanding cheerleaders?"".Lea Thompson does her usual under appreciated job as Tom's main squeeze. Her nude scene and a little girl awaken by some football team hijinks steal the show.For the most part, we have seen it all before.",All the Right Moves

He needs that athletic scholarship, but his attitude is a problem. His coach, Nickerson( Craig T Nelson), wants a winning season so he can get that big college coaching job. Stefan wants to make something of himself, and doesn't want to be stuck working in a steel mill like is father, and brother Greg ( Gary Graham). His friend Brian, ( Christopher Penn), gets a full ride to University of Southern California, but something unexpected blows his chances. Vinnie Salvucci ( Paul Carafotes), just doesn't get much playing time. When he does, it's only as a back-up. Stefan's girlfriend, Lisa ( Lea Thompson) wants out too, she has ambitions just like he does. . She wants to study music, but the only scholarships that are offered are to football players.When the big game comes between Ampipe and the third ranked team in the state. Stefan and Nickerson see this as an opportunity. The game goes down to the wire, but a costly fumble cost Ampipe the game. In the locker room, Vinnie who fumbled, is crying. He knows the winning the game was on his shoulders. When Nickerson comes in, he balls Vinnie out. Stefan Steps in and a shouting match ensues. This cost Stefan, and he his tossed off the team.

The others go way too far and trash Nickerson's house.Stefan confronts Nickerson, about what happened. He had no idea it would go as far as it did. Lisa even tries to help, by talking to his wife. Stefan knows he screwed up, and discovers his brother just got laid off. Later that night as he is leaving; he apologizes to Nickerson's wife when they are having dinner. The coach confronts him outside, and words are exchanged. Stephan talks about where most of the other on the team are going; and bringing up the fact that Nickerson landed that great coaching job. Stephan will be stuck in Ampipe working at the mill.The next day after working at the mill, Stephan sees his girlfriend; and notices Nickerson there. Lisa tells him that Nickerson is offering him a full scholarship to Cal-Poly. Stefan will be able to embark on a great future.I like this movie and I'm not a Tom Cruise fan. The main reason I like the movie is it's all about sports, and one I love football. I was a varsity athlete and I've been there. You do all you can to be the best. A coach can make you or break you, making all the right moves is what it takes. This is a good film, but it falls short compared to Remember the Titans.",All the Right Moves
30,ereinion,Passable teenage football drama,7,6 October 2006,"Tom Cruise's first leading role. He does very well considering the fact he's only 21. Chris Penn also delivers well. Others are so-so. Craig T. ""The Coach"" Nelson really couldn't avoid getting type-casted as the coach type after this. He plays the role so convincingly with his stern and authoritative appearance.Apart from the setting in the grey steel worker town in the middle of nowhere, this movie has no strong story or issue. Its a standard 80's fare. Stefen is worried about his future in a sport that is dominated by big and often black men, while he himself is short and white. His brother loses his job and his teammate and best friend (Penn) makes a girl pregnant and has to give up his promising career. Meanwhile, young Stef goes face to face with the coach after an upsetting loss and is thrown out of the team. Upset and hurt, he does something stupid to retaliate and things get even worse between him and the coach. Not only that, but he worsens the relationship with his all so supportive girlfriend.Save for the corny title song, the stupid locker room scene at the beginning and Cruise's grinning, this is a quite enjoyable film for those who like such teenage situation dramas. ""Action dramas"" as I'd call them. And things work out well in the end, as they always do. This is perhaps the first movie where Cruise showed potential as actor. His other movie of the same year was a total bomb, made only for money. This looks like something, but sometimes is hard to take seriously because of its teenage bubblegum nature. Still it could have been a lot worse.",All the Right Moves

33,spencer-w-hensley,Good performances from Cruise and Craig T. Nelson are not enough to make this cliche-filled storyless movie work,5,26 January 2019,"I was really looking forward to this film for two reasons: 1. It was one Tom Cruise's earliest film roles 2. I love Craig T. Nelson and his sitcom ""Coach"", and when I found out he also played a football coach in this film, I was actually kind of excited. And then I watched the movie. While Cruise and Nelson give good performances (even though Nelson is basically doing a poor man's version of his Hayden Fox character that he would portray on ""Coach"" years later), it is still not enough to make this movie satisfying, as there really is no story, or at least a very interesting one at that. You have seen it all before a small town football team can't win against their undefeated rivals. Cruise plays the hot shot football player who can only to go to college on a football scholarship. Nelson doesn't like his disrespect for authority, and kicks him off the team.... This movie could be the textbook for film students on film cliches. Another problem is Lea Thompson's performance as Cruise's high school girlfriend. Her performance is so unbelievably wooden. Unfortunately she does not get to show the charm that she would go on to show as Lorraine Banes McFly 2 years later in ""Back to the Future."" She was wonderful in that film and proved she could act, but here the character is just a cliched stereotype and her dialogue as well as the direction of her performance is unsatisfactory. Also, another distracting and frankly unnecessary subplot involves Chris Penn as Cruise's teammate and best friend getting his girlfriend pregnant, then doing a shotgun wedding and turning down the opportunity to attend USC to father his child. Another obvious cliche that doesn't do the plot any justice. Additionally, Penn who would go on to do wonderful work in Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", is underused and practically has nothing to do with very little character development. Additionally, there is another stupid subplot about Cruise being blackballed by Nelson because he was at Nelson's house when it was vandalized by a townsperson. And when Cruise confronts him about the vandalism the movie abruptly decides he is some sort of villian and then totally forgets about it. There is also a subplot of one of Cruise's teammates being arrested for armed robbery and that goes away quicker than the snap of a finger and nothing is really explained in detail. It makes you ask the question: ""what was the point of that scene anyways?"" Aside from the two main performances there is nothing here to really offer in the way of genuine entertainment. What's left when it is all said and done is a movie filled with cliches, no character development whatsoever, and a story that acts as if it knew all along that it never really had anything that entertaining to offer its audience to begin with.",All the Right Moves
34,TC-Batsy,A Very Underrated Teen Movie,10,25 October 2012,"All the Right Moves is a wonderful classic movie from the 80's about a group of teenagers from a small mining town in Pennsylvania who want to secure their future by getting scholarships so they can go to the best schools in the country. Stefan is a skilled football player who dreams of becoming an engineer instead of working at the mill like his father and brother, his girlfriend Lisa wants to study music but unfortunately their high school only provides football scholarships to its students. When the Ampipe High School team loses the football game to the Walnut Heights, all the players are depressed by the loss. After Stef clashes with Coach Nickerson over the players' performance, he kicks him out of the team which makes things worse for the ambitious youth. Tom Cruise at the age of 21 was excellent in the role of Stef which came after his success in Risky Business that later made him the world's most richest and prosperous movie star. Lea Thompson was perfect as Lisa, the gifted musician who knows she can't go to college and at the same be with Stef whom she loves.",All the Right Moves

37,leczorn,The best high school sports movie ever!,9,3 July 2011,"It took me 28 years to finally get around to seeing this high school football drama, but it was well worth the wait and probably for the best, since I appreciate it far more now at 40 than I could've at 12.I remember when it came out in late 1983, a few months after Tom Cruise became a star through ""Risky Business."" Despite a solid publicity campaign, ""All the Wrong Moves"" failed to reap a huge benefit from Cruise's presence. The movie grossed a modest $17,233,166 at the American box office and quickly faded into obscurity.Then I saw it in the $3 bin at Big Lots and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did, because it's a diamond in the rough; definitely the best high school sports movie I've ever seen. Rather than the usual sports movie clichés, such as the focus on ""the big game,"" this is a heavyweight drama that's about football on the surface but life at the core.Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic (played by Cruise) resides in the blue collar town of Ampipe, Pennsylvania, where he plays cornerback for the local high school football team. He resides with his older brother, Rick (Gary Graham), and their father (Charles Cioffi), both of whom work in the local steel mill, as does seemingly every man in town. Stef's and Rick's mother is dead and the three Djordjevic men seem to all have a pretty good relationship with each other. And at a couple of points in the latter half of the movie, the father shows great support in the midst of his son's hardships.Now a senior, Stef is a moderate college prospect and has realistic expectations. Being a mere 5'10"" (178 cm) and white, he has no illusions of making the NFL, and being a B student, he has no illusions of getting an academic scholarship. But he hopes to attain a college football scholarship and earn a degree in engineering. Still, he's uncomfortable with the possibility of being far away from his beautiful cheerleader girlfriend, Lisa (Lea Thompson), a junior who adores him, even though she's not a football fan.Ampipe's next game is at Walnut Heights, who is undefeated and ranked #3 in the state, as well as located in a much wealthier area. Stef and some of his teammates view the game as an opportunity to impress college scouts and break away from what they see as a dead end town. Ampipe is economically struggling and the steel mill is laying off many workers. And the team's tough, no-nonsense head coach, Nickerson (Craig T. Nelson), is also looking beyond the town, pursing college assistant coaching jobs.Late in the game, with Ampipe trailing 10-7, Stef intercepts a pass and returns it for a touchdown. But shortly afterward, while disobeying Nickerson's order to go after the ball instead of the receiver, Stef commits a crucial pass interference penalty that contributes to his team losing. In the locker room right after the game, he and Nickerson have an argument that results in Stef's dismissal from the team. Nickerson won't even Stef ride home on the team bus and tells him to ride with the cheerleaders.Instead, he hitches a ride home with some Ampipe fans, who stop at Nickerson's house and vandalize it. Not realizing what they were going to do, Stef unsuccessfully tries to stop it. Nickerson's daughter hears the vandalizing and tells her father, who goes outside and sees the vandals fleeing. It's initially uncertain whether he got a close enough look at Stef.But the next week, Stef visits Nickerson at a football practice, apologizing for his role in the argument and asking for re-instatement to the team, which has only one game left. But Nickerson says that he saw Stef at Nickerson's house that night after the game. Stef insists that he did none of the vandalizing but Nickerson doesn't believe that.The day of the game, Greg and 700 others get laid off from the steel mill. In his ensuing depression, he goes out and gets drunk. While he's gone, Lisa comes over and she and Stef have sex for the first time.The next few weeks are chaotic for Stef and his teammates. Brian (Christopher Penn), having just accepted a scholarship offer from USC, learns that his girlfriend, Tracy (Paige Lyn Price), is pregnant. They keep the baby and get married. Vinnie Salvucci (Paul Carafotes) gets arrested for armed robbery. And Stef's previous scholarship offers are revoked, leading him to believe that he was blackballed by Nickerson. And though Lisa is bitter about athletes getting scholarships while other deserving students don't, she goes to Nickerson's wife and tries to intervene.And without revealing the ending, I will say that it has great messages of forgiveness and the selflessness inherent in pure love.""All the Right Moves"" mostly lives up to its title. All of the performances are top notch and both 80s small town high school life and the atmosphere of big time high school football are portrayed flawlessly. I also like that the school has a good mix of blacks and whites and that people of the two races have much positive interaction throughout the movie, both on and off the football team.In addition, the scenery brings Ampipe powerfully to life and the rock dominated soundtrack, while not one of the best of the genre, further cements the movie's early 80s feel. And don't be turned away if you're not a football fan. The movie actually contains only one game scene. While the surface theme, as I said, is football, many other surface themes could equally be used to teach the same lessons.The movie is a fairly heavy R, mostly for language and a couple of semi-graphic sex scenes, but if you can tolerate that, it's hard to find a better teen dominated drama than this.",All the Right Moves
38,TheSteelHelmetReturns,"All the right moves is alright. <- That's your pun, the review is below.",7,6 November 2010,"All the Right Moves begins with the triumphant synth rock melody of David Campbell's score accompanied by shots of grimy working class settings of train terminals and factories indicating that viewer is in store for a blue collar John Hughes films that has one foot in eighties cinema and the other still dipped in the obsessions with 70s New Hollywood. Tom Cruise is quite convincing as a working class jock while Lea Thompson as she only helps to bring up connotations of herself in Back to the Future and would seem more appropriate in a world of upper middle class WASPs like Growing Pains or Family Ties rather than the lurid Welcome Back Kotter universe of All the Right Moves. Perhaps Cruise needed a girlfriend who seemed a little sluttier but still had Thompson's vulnerability? Ally McSheedy? Chris Penn plays Cruise's less attractive jock pal and Craig T. Nelson establishes his typecast as a humourless coach and all three characters express similar desires very early in the film about 'moving on' and escaping their working class background. Knowing the direction that the manufacturing industry would take in the 80s this is probably an understandable goal. However, each character have obstacles preventing them from establishing that dream - some of which are intertwined. Lea Thompson contributes to this story by making Tom Cruise sexually frustrated during awkward love scenes. High school football is used as a metaphor for cooperating to exceed ones limits as detailed by Craig T. Nelson in a pre-game speech that would lead to him being fired if it were uttered today let alone ten years ago. It's at this point of the review, I wish to remind the viewer I have no idea how American Football works - all I know is people jump on each other and touchdown is a good thing. Anyway some play happens in the game that causes Cruise to be thrown off the team for disciplinary reasons and this all leads to a descent that includes being falsely framed for terrorising the neighbourhood and the last half hour of the film covers a number of other plot twists that occur from that one prior conflict along with a short resolution. With just under ninety minutes of run time All the Right Moves is a satisfyingly short rise and fall and rise story with an interesting mix of New Hollywood drama and the emerging 80s teen film genre.",All the Right Moves

Clichéd dialogue / story lines, and amped up dramatic background music (turn volume to 11!) do not a good movie make.People in this movie look overly self-conscious that they ARE in a movie, even background people (eyes shift nervously everywhere, BUT toward the camera, which made this viewer conscious that they were trying oh so hard to not look at the camera! very distracting!).Cliché, cliché, cliché... like being forced to watch Iron Eagle.. yuck.way too much like An Officer and a Gentleman in Pennsylvania!probably why this guy never directed another major movie after this and Clan of the Cave Bear (1986)...He and/or his bosses must have realized he was out of his element.",All the Right Moves
41,flpianomusic,Good film,9,5 September 2020,"Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors. This film is one the first that he starred. It is nice to see real America, real working class people, tough, hard working, honest people. People were the backbone of the country's economy, industry, people who can take life at its challenge. I was sorting my VHS, and this one is definitely a keeper.",All the Right Moves
42,tigersontop,Think-Allentown PA/Billy Joel Song,7,6 November 2001,"This movie came out around the time the Billy Joel Song Allentown was released.  After viewing the movie for the first time, the words from that song seemed to describe the situation perfectly for the working class in this movie.Cruises Character is an intelligent,driven yet stubborn teenager who clashes with his High School Football Coach.  He is a star High School football player whose best hope for attending college is an athletic scholarship. What I liked about this movie was you saw life through the eyes of a 17 year old living in a very real adult world. One that isn't always fair and cruel. It paints an accurate picture that the choices one makes at 17 can effect your entire life. Chris Penn's character is an example of this  as well.Early appearances by Lea Thompson, and a strong performance given by Craig T. Nelson anchor this film as well.  Very good soundtrack boosts this film as well.  7/10.",All the Right Moves
43,buccoman11,Cruise's unknown masterpiece,10,16 August 2003,"Im my opinion, this is Tom Cruise's best film.  This film not risky business is what really put him on the map.  Craig T Nelson also did a great job as Ampipes football coach.  I live in Western Pennsylvania I can tell you that the townspeople are really that obsessed about high school football.  This is one of the best unknown classics and I give it my highest recomendation.10/10",All the Right Moves
44,Vivacious_J,Tender but rough story about high school football,8,31 October 2002,"I saw this flick a few months ago and would rate it as a 3/5. Although the whole ""trials and tribulations of smalltown high school football"" thing has been played out a little the last twenty years, I still think that this film can stand on its own because of some heartfelt and rather convincing performances from its actors, particularly, Lea Thompson and Craig T. Nelson. Craig has mastered the art of playing the role of a coach and yes it is typecast but he does it better than anyone else can so I give the man props. Surprisingly, I remember feeling worried and almost half-convinced that Stef might not receive a scholarship and that the movie would end on a sad depressing note reminiscent of the condition of the town it happens in. However, Cruise does get his scholarship so all is well in football land.Speaking of the football, this IS the reality of a small western PA town i am from Eastern ohio (10 mins from PA) and have seen this ssame type of attitude and spirit that an entire town can pay a team that gives them some hope and makes them feel like everyone can win even if it is vicariously through others. But what I really wanted to note on was the chemistry, accuracy and tenderness that was created between Cruise and Thompson during their ""love scene"" when they both lose their virginity. I thought it was so well done and sincere compared to similar scenes I have scene. It ranks among the best to show the vulnerability mixed with desire that this kind of moment possesses. Good but not great movie.",All the Right Moves
45,secretdomineux,"""WORKING"" America",9,4 November 2010,"I really liked this film, oddly, more now, than twenty five years ago. I saw that someone interpreted the goofing off in the dressing room, as ""gay"". If you are, or have been an varsity athlete, you'll know that teammates, will do things in front of each other, that they wouldn't do in front of anyone else. Even more so, if they have all grown up together, through elementary, little league etc. Remember the ""pat on the ass"" in days past, before some said; that looks gay. Don't get me wrong, I know there are, and have been gay football players, which I WAS SURPRISED to learn, but to describe the scene as ""gay"" I found distasteful. I suppose I like this film, because I've always, loved that part of this country, and what it meant; hard working families, cradle to grave employment, and the best quarterbacks EVER. My Great Grandmother was born and spent most of her life in Homestead, and the girls from there that I've had the pleasure meeting, have been sweethearts, cuties!",All the Right Moves
46,jagardner66,So I'm at my parents house the other day.....,7,25 May 2005,"Ah, the classic 80's film, the big hair, the bad lighting, the lame music, everything that embodies the great American films of 1983. And ""All the Right Moves"" is no exception. I'm 24, and just viewed this movie for the first time last week by stumbling upon it at my parent's house while I was visiting for the weekend. Why do you care? I live in Johnstown, where this movie was filmed (as was 1977's Paul Newman classic ""Slap Shot"") and I had never heard of this film! So, I find this dusty VHS copy and take it home with me to view. As i pull it out of its slip sleeve, a yellowed napkin falls out; with Tom's autograph on it! Turns out when I was about 1, my parents brought me down to Johnstown to ride on the Inclined Plane, and I was introduced to Tom Cruise. I never knew?! So knowing that, I had to give the movie a thorough watching, and I must say, I have a little pride that that film was shot here. It was an enjoyable movie, although the ending was a little dry. The sad part of the film is, all the activity and energy that takes place in the movie with the steel mills is no longer here. The mills have been shut down for about 20 years, and the city is pretty much in a depressed state. It's good to watch the movie just to get a glimpse of what this area use to be. So watch it, enjoy it, heck, you can even rent it from the rental place a block from my house. That place is called ""All the Right Movies."" Enjoy! P.S. For the Kid's sake, It is rated R for strong language and some intense nudity.",All the Right Moves
47,cruise1188,Tom Cruise's first best,10,4 June 2000,"The title says exactlly what it means. This is Tom Cruise's 3rd movie and we all know that he has many best, and this is defintly his first best.It tells the story of a football playing high school student who wants to be an enginer, and is in a way ""using"" footbal to get a into a good school ""using"" his football schorship. i must say even if the story sounds boring, it is a classic story of hanging on to what you want. And in the clear spirt of movies like ""Footloose"" and ""Sixteen Candles,"" All the Right Moves is a classic 80's film with an orignal plot, but still has that  one thing that is excatly the same in every 80's movies about teens. Whcih is pretty much every 80's movie.",All the Right Moves
48,Chill cat,Movie chronicles the struggles of a small town football player.,9,20 May 2001,"While this may not be a top 250 movie it definetely deserves more credit than it gets.  When being compared to other movies related to the same subject,(ie. the program, Varsity blues) the real life stance this picture takes should not be overlooked.  Other football movies have never shown the difficulties that athletes can go through with their own coaches throughout the recruiting process for college.  This movie shows some of the actual themes that many highschool athletes have to deal even to this day.",All the Right Moves
49,sugarhigh01013,The summary of the movie?,7,5 February 2005,"I love this movie, because tom cruise is just so young and hot in it, and it took place in ""J-town"" (Johnstown) where i currently live. Well i live in Richland, which is the higher part of Johnstown (that didn't get hit by the floods :-P) And it seems so neat just to look at it and be like wow Tom Cruise was in the old Jtown high school, and he was by central park closer to the end (where he is yelling at his coach and starts running, where he starts running, that is central park) My uncle was also in this movie. He used to work at the steel mill but they got laid off so he now works at an elevator service, but when they are walking up the steps, and tom cruise and lea Thompson (sp?) are talking, you will see a guy with a reddish color hair and really ugly glasses, and that would be my uncle. ha ha its kind of scary actually, but don't worry, he looks better now :-P",All the Right Moves
50,CreekerMom,Classic Movie- I am in it :),10,26 March 2006,"I voted this to be Excellent as it is a great movie especially from the 80'sAnother reason is because I was in this movie as was the rest of my Senior Class at JHS 1983. It was an awesome experience that has lasted a lifetime. It is one of the rare movies that I can watch and actually enjoy over and over again.If you haven't checked the movie out, I personally encourage you to do so it is a classic Tom Cruise Movie. Sad thing is I liked him so much better way back then.:)Valerie (Zabala)",All the Right Moves
