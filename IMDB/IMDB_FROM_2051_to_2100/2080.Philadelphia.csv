0,MartinHafer,Hanks is amazing...I can see why he got an Oscar for this one.,9,25 January 2019,"Although ""Philadelphia"" debuted decades ago, I only got to finally seeing it today. Why? Well, the film is incredibly depressing and I kept putting it off...and that might explain why you might not have yet seen it as well. It is sad...but also exceptionally well made and worth your time.Tom Hanks stars as Andrew Beckett, a hot-shot lawyer at one of the top law firms in Philadelphia. Despite having just been made an associate (a reward for excellent service), he suddenly finds himself fired. The firm uses an excuse--blaming a mistake he supposedly made on one recent case. But this would not account for the firing and he appears to have been fired because he's ill...suffering from AIDS. Beckett has a hard time finding a lawyer to take a wrongful termination case for him and he's too sick to do this alone. Eventually, he finds a rather homophobic lawyer (Denzel Washington) to take the case...and the second half of the film is the courtroom battle to bring justice to Andrew.Unlike many films, this one was filmed sequentially. This was important to do because Tom Hanks starved himself and as the movie progresses, his weight loss and excellent make up made it appear as if he was suffering the progressive effects of the disease. Hanks truly put himself out for this role...and it's among the best things he's ever done. Apart from that, it's a well made film...worth seeing and very touching. It's also fascinating to watch to see how far thinking has come regarding gay people and HIV/AIDS.",Philadelphia
1,TheLittleSongbird,A ground-breaking film and a splendid one,9,5 June 2015,"Philadelphia is ground-breaking for being the first major Hollywood film about AIDS and for Tom Hanks receiving his first Best Actor Oscar. The good thing is that Philadelphia is a great, no splendid, film that handles a difficult subject remarkably.It's a well-made film, not one of the most beautiful-looking films ever but it's nonetheless shot with style and grace and the close ups look good and don't feel overused at all. It's also beautifully directed by Silence of the Lambs' Jonathan Demme, he ensures that everything looks good, that the characters remain interesting and that the drama is fully allowed to resonate emotionally, with some lovely subtle touches like in the family scenes.The music fits like a glove, not just the soothing resonance of Howard Shore's score but especially the song choices. Two song choices stood out, the Oscar-winning and very powerful Streets of Philadelphia by Bruce Springsteen and in particular the near-definitive Maria Callas rendition of the sublime La Mamma Morta from Andrea Chenier accompanying the opera scene. The script is very thoughtful and enough to stir up plenty of emotions, it is a touch heavy-handed on occasions but considering the subject matter there was always going to be a chance it was going to happen. Philadelphia also has a hugely compelling and deeply moving story, and that is not just because of having a sensitive subject and dealing with it as intelligently as the film did, but also the numerous powerful scenes. The final scene, Miller intervening when Andy's discriminated against in the library, the 'children on the back of the bus' line, Miller's speech on breaking the law and Andy's expression as he steps out of Miller's office after being rejected are all really well done scenes that get even better on repeat viewings, but the standout is the opera scene, not just the perfect choice of music but it's also such an emotionally powerful scene, due to it being a master-class in close-up acting and how life-affirming it is(not just for Joe in his epiphany moment but for the viewer as well).Philadelphia has a top-notch cast who all give wonderful performances thanks to interesting characters(Miller being the one that progresses the most)and powerful material. Tom Hanks fully deserved his Best Actor Oscar, not just because of the truly brave nature of the role but also, and especially so, the amount of emotional connection Hanks puts into it, not filling the 'gay stereotype' at all. He is especially brilliant in the opera scene and at the end. Denzel Washington has the meatier role and plays it with such authority and compelling poise, also showing excellent chemistry with Hanks, while I appreciated the subdued performance of Antonio Banderas and Joanne Woodward's nuanced turn as Andy's mother. Jason Robards also stands out, underneath the bluff his character is a complete reptile which Robards plays to bone-chilling effect.All in all, splendid film and more than just a ground-breaking film about AIDS. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Philadelphia
2,bkoganbing,Another Philadelphia Lawyer Fights For His Life And A Life With Dignity,10,28 January 2010,"Have you ever wondered where the term Philadelphia lawyer comes from? It dates back to our colonial times when in 1735 New York newspaper editor John Peter Zenger was arrested for libel when he printed some really unflattering things about the colonial governor. As counsel he retained Andrew Hamilton who came from Philadelphia and with the court really stacked against him, Hamilton pulled out a victory. The term then entered our lexicon to mean a really sharp attorney that's totally up on his game.Young promising attorney in a white shoe law firm Tom Hanks is terminated abruptly and rather clumsily when its discovered he has AIDS. Hanks had been a shining star in that firm, but he'd been in the closet because as he later testified he saw a rather homophobic atmosphere among the old partners in the firm. When one of the partners spotted the telltale lesion that signifies Karposi's Sarcoma, Hanks was set up to take the fall.Hanks is deteriorating rapidly and is a believer that a lawyer representing himself has a fool for a client. The man he eventually chooses is Denzel Washington, one of those guys you see advertising on television. Washington knew Hanks from previous cases, but is as shocked as everyone else to find out about Hanks's sexual orientation. Washington has a few issues of his own with gay people as well, but he gradually comes around as a believer in his cause and a believer in Hanks's worth and dignity as a human being.Tom Hanks won the first of two consecutive Best Actor Oscars with Philadelphia which was only done once before by Spencer Tracy. With the use of some creative makeup which also was nominated, Hanks turns in a perfect performance of a man deteriorating because of the various illnesses besetting his immune system. It's real, I've certainly seen it enough with people I've known. That's one of the horrible things about AIDS. I know people who were diagnosed with it back in the middle Eighties and are still with us. I've also known those who have deteriorated literally within weeks of getting the diagnosis. Seeing Hanks on the screen mirrored so many people who have passed in and out of my life.Denzel Washington proves one thing about acting said by people like Spencer Tracy that half the job is listening and communicating the fact that you are taking in those words the other player is speaking. When the opera loving Hanks talks about an aria that Maria Callas is singing watch Washington's expressions. Without a word of dialog he's telling the audience what a seminal experience he is having listening to Hanks and how his view of him has come around.Jason Robards and Robert Ridgely play two of the smug senior partners who are really grilled on their homophobia by Washington. Another standout performance is that of Mary Steenburgen who the white show firm retains as counsel. She's a deadly cross examiner and a real match for Washington in court. And Antonio Banderas is touching as Hanks's loving partner who Washington promises to Hanks he'll get the best probate lawyer possible for him when the time comes.Of course the film got the official imprimatur of having none other than the Mayor of Philadelphia, Edward Rendell, make an appearance. Rendell went on to be Governor of Pennsylvania and Democratic National Chairman. I recognized quite a few of the locations in center city Philadelphia from some of my trips there. Philadelphia got one other Oscar for none other than Bruce Springsteen for his original song The Streets of Philadelphia. It was nominated for Best Makeup, Best Adapted Screenplay and for another song entitled Philadelphia by Neil Young.Tom Hanks became the face of AIDS for America and for the world with this film and the Oscar he won for it. And this review is dedicated to a young man named Robert Lynn who was a bartender I knew way back when in Brooklyn Heights who was the first person I know to die from this terrible plague. Back then it was the 'gay' disease and government was frozen in indifference toward those who had it.It's no longer a 'gay' disease, lots of education went into making that fact rather obvious. Lots of people like Robert Lynn and so many more I've known went into the ground before their time before the medicines to control the disease and how it attacks the immune system had to unnecessarily happen. Let's have a film showing the final cure for this terrible thing and in the near future.",Philadelphia
3,Leofwine_draca,Moving drama with some top actors,6,15 September 2018,"PHILADELPHIA is a legal drama filled with emotion and based on a true story. It's also one of the few Hollywood films to look at the AIDS epidemic that was prevalent at the time. The film stars an Oscar winning Tom Hanks as a man dying of AIDS who finds himself unfairly dismissed from his place of work; he decides to sue his former employers and employs a brash lawyer, played by a youthful Denzel Washington in a star-making turn, to help him. Directed by Jonathan Demme, PHILADELPHIA is a thoughtful human drama which takes a look at bigotry in the workplace and champions a liberal agenda. Hanks, almost unrecognisable as the lead, delivers an affecting performance but it's Washington who really shines as the entertainment here. Generally this is understated and moving, aside from the over-the-top sentimental stuff at the climax.",Philadelphia
4,SnoopyStyle,Terrific performances,8,2 September 2014,Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is a gay lawyer with boyfriend Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas) who finds out that he has AIDS. He gets a new big client. He finishes the work in time but has to go to the hospital. His boss Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards) fires him blaming it on the work when all of it mysteriously go missing. He tries to hire ambulance chaser Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to file a wrongful termination but he is too homophobic to take the case. He decides to take on the case after witnessing some discrimination.Tom Hanks hits it out of the park. The way that director Jonathan Demme follows Hanks' hands as he touches everything in Joe Miller's office is just terrific. Denzel Washington takes an interesting character and gives him life. And Jason Robards is a powerful villain. The acting is superb all around and the story is compelling.,Philadelphia
5,Hitchcoc,A Story of Human Endurance,10,1 January 2017,"I know it's already been said, but I need to repeat that this is a story about the courage of a person who needs to put closure to his life. Of course, he is gay and a victim of AIDS. He has been let go from his job because the higher ups in his firm think he will transmit his disease to others. It is filled with misinformation and prejudice. But it was really common when this was made. It is played to the hilt by Tom Hanks who puts an incredible signature to the role. He obviously studied the disease and its manifestations. I'm aware that some have said that this movie leads to judgment of the gay community, defining by the AIDS epidemic. But, it is my belief, that it took on the issues that were used to persecute these people. Hanks' character is strong and unyielding, willing to use what is left of his life to fight the forces that are working to crush him. An excellent film.",Philadelphia
6,Prismark10,The voices of friends vanished and gone,6,2 November 2018,"The critic Mark Cousins interviewed Jonathan Demme in 1999 for a BBC television series where they went through the directors work. Cousins had the gall to tell Demme to his face that he was going to skip discussing Philadelphia because he disliked it so much.Demme later admitted that he was trying to reach out to people who couldn't care less about people with Aids. In the early 1990s homophobia was more overt in the USA and western Europe than it is a quarter of a century later. There was certainly more antagonism and discrimination against people with Aids.The film opens with a sublime song by Bruce Springsteen and ends with a haunting one from Neil Young. In the middle you get some awful long operatic scene which really does not work.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is up and coming hot shot lawyer for a top law firm who has Aids. When one of the parter's in the firm discover a lesion on his face Andy gets fired. The partners tell him that his work was not up to scratch and he had an attitude problem.Andy sees it as discrimination, he knows some of the partners are homophobic. The firm had earlier had given him an important case to litigate. Andy tries to hire ambulance chaser Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to fight his wrongful termination claim after other lawyers had declined to take his case on. Miller also turns him down, he too is uncomfortable with Andy's sexuality and illness but later changes his mind.The film can be applauded to bring the issue of Aids discrimination to the forefront. It also had several people in the movie who had Aids or HIV.However the film suffers from clunkiness and mawkishness. Some of the courtroom scenes were jagged. Some of Andy's ex bosses came across as creepy old men in the witness box.It is still an important film in gay cinema despite actually being timid in showing Andy's relationship with his lover as well as having straight actors in the main roles.",Philadelphia
7,gavin6942,Great Film at the Right Time,8,4 November 2015,"When a man with AIDS (Tom Hanks) is fired by his law firm because of his condition, he hires a homophobic small time lawyer (Denzel Washington) as the only willing advocate for a wrongful dismissal suit.I absolutely love seeing Roger Corman on the stand... thanks, Jonathan Demme for letting Roger appear in your films. Maybe the average viewer doesn't appreciate the nod, but it's not lost on the rest of us.Strangely, as Tom Hanks' disease progresses, he looks increasingly like David Hyde Pierce. Coincidence? Hanks was rightly praised for this film, but it seems that the real strong performance came from Washington. We has a wide range of hatred, fear, grudging acceptance and more... it is a nice roller coaster.",Philadelphia
8,lee_eisenberg,Hanks gives his best performance ever,10,5 October 2005,"""Philadelphia"" may be the movie that changed Hollywood. For so many years, they portrayed gays as sissies, but this movie forced them to change. Tom Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime as AIDS-afflicted lawyer Andrew Beckett, fired from his law firm after they discover his condition. Equally good is Denzel Washington as homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, who is forced to ignore his own stereotypes in taking Andrew's case. Good support also comes from Jason Robards as Andrew's vicious ex-boss, Joanne Woodward as Andrew's ever-loving mother, and Antonio Banderas as Andrew's companion.Maybe this is just me, but I think that ""Philadelphia"" was released at just the right time. Think back to 1993. We had just come out of the Reagan-Bush years and we now had Clinton. Maybe he wasn't openly pro-gay, but he did change the military's policy towards gays. Moreover, Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are analogous to Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier: the embodiment of the new era under a new president (in Newman's and Poitier's case, it was Kennedy; in fact, those two co-starred in ""Paris Blues"" the year that Kennedy became president, much like Hanks and Washington were starring in ""Philadelphia"" the year that Clinton became president). But let's not get sidetracked. This is a great movie, and I recommend it to everyone.",Philadelphia
9,jboothmillard,Philadelphia,9,15 September 2005,"Director Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs) has created an emotional story, and it was the first major Hollywood film about the incurable disease Aids. Basically Andrew Beckett (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Tom Hanks) is a homosexual lawyer infected with the disease, and over time develops lesions. He is unexpectedly fired from his job, and he is suing them on the grounds that they feared contracting the disease from him. He is hoping to win the case with the help of homophobic lawyer Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), but over time, he sees that he is like any other (straight) person. As the witnesses give their opinions with Andrew's work, behaviour and health, Andrew's health is declining more and more, to the upset of both Joe and Andrew's partner Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas). Towards the end, Andrew is taken into hospital, just before his victory is concluded, and not too long later, he dies very tragically of his disease, with Joe and Miguel by his side. Also starring Jason Robards as Charles Wheeler, Back to the Future III's Mary Steenburgen as Belinda Conine, Ron Vawter as Bob Seidman, Robert Ridgely as Walter Kenton, Charles Napier as Judge Garnett and Joanne Woodward as Sarah Beckett. Washington is fantastic as the defending lawyer, the supporting cast all do their part too, but of course Hanks steals the show with his deserved award-winning performance. He really makes you believe in his struggle and it affects you so much that you want him to succeed, and his most remembered scene is his praise for an operatic song with passionate gestures. It won the Oscar (and Golden Globe) for Best Song for Bruce Springsteen's ""Streets of Philadelphia"" (it was also number 68 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and it was nominated for Best Makeup, Best Song for Neil Young's ""Philadelphia"" and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Denzel Washington was number 28, and Tom Hanks number number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Washington was number 40, and Hanks number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, Andrew Beckett was number 49 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was 27 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",Philadelphia
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Well-Acted, Involving Propaganda Piece",6,9 November 2006,"Who can argue this isn't a superior-acted film and a powerful story.....but, sorry folks, it's the wrong message. This is nothing but a pro-gay agenda propaganda flick. It just packaged slickly.Granted, no one should be fired from their job just because they are gay or have AIDs, for that matter, but this movie only portrays gays as wonderful, caring people while showing people against that lifestyle as mean-spirited. This is just so typical of the ultra-Liberal entertainment business. Talk about ""stereotypes!!!"" Anyway, all the characters in the movie are interesting ones, especially the two leads, played by Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, two of today's best actors and closet Liberals. It's an interesting story, too, which begins with an excellent Bruce Springsteen song accompanied by some nice shots of the city of Philadelphia.",Philadelphia
11,moonspinner55,Serious sentimentality,6,18 June 2006,"AIDS-infected lawyer sues the company that fired him. Director Jonathan Demme, perhaps doing penance for making transsexuals look bad in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", wants to walk the fence throughout ""Philadelphia"", determined to show all sides and give every voice an opportunity to be heard. That's fine, but there's so much sentiment poured into the mix that it's clear Demme wants us to love and adore the Hanks character. I saw no reason for it. As tragic as the illness is, the character as written isn't very interesting or sympathetic. His family (devoted sweater-wearing types who live in a Norman Rockwell world) and his love-interest (Antonio Banderas) aren't terribly believable (Banderas is just kept around for a dance and a pat on the hand; we get little evidence of their commitment as a couple). The film looks fine and is well-made (except for those extreme close-ups of Jason Robards' snarling face: ""For Chrissake, someone call a doctor!""), but it isn't an exceptionally moving picture. Instead, it's solemn, sobering, and a bit stand-offish. **1/2 from ****",Philadelphia
12,Quinoa1984,A powerful film about a important subject,8,22 February 2001,"Many people are homophobic (or aren't even afraid, just don't like) and do not like people with AIDS.  However, I think that even for the most puritan of people, they might have the first step of changing they're minds, especially if they are fans of the actors.  Philadelphia is a usual courtroom drama, however it has a topic on it's side (2 to be precise) that probably no other film before 1993 had- gay people with the AIDS virus. 
Tom Hanks plays a lawyer here who gets supposedly fired by his firm due to the fact that he has aids.  He then gets another lawyer, played in a good supporting role by Denzel Washington, to defend him and sue the firm.  While it can sometimes get sidetracked, the film is often on track and takes it process smart-like, mainly by director Demme.  One of the better films of 1993.  By the way, I was surprised (considering I saw this film a few years ago after Seeing Desperado) that that is Antonio Banderas as Hanks' lover. A",Philadelphia
13,sunwarrior13,A Landmark Movie On AIDS,10,28 December 2011,"Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction.It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.",Philadelphia

15,hitchcockthelegend,"What do you love about the law, Andrew?",9,14 July 2009,"Andrew Beckett is a gay lawyer infected with AIDS, who in spite of being his law firm's rising star, is fired on a trumped up charge of negligence. Refusing to accept defeat, Andrew manages to enlist the help of homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, whom it's hoped, can prove that the firm acted disgracefully out of fear of Andrew's illness. But can Joe throw off his own prejudice? Can Andrew keep it together as AIDS starts to take a hold?Philadelphia was the film to really bring the horrors of AIDS to the masses. Though certainly not the first film to deal with the subject, films such as ""An Early Frost (1985)"" and ""As Is (1986)"" had led the way, Philadelphia is certainly the most memorable of all the mainstream films dealing with the subject.As the years have rolled by, the film's standing has waned some what, gays have renounced the film as over sentimental gloop and various other cinema critics have accused the film of confusing its aims. The truth is that Philadelphia is only really guilty of playing it safe. Andrew Beckett is clearly wronged, and he's clearly a lovely and special man, supported by a complete and loyal loving family. It's the character set up that never really puts the film in any real danger of becoming edgy, even the strand dealing with homophobia is only briefly given credence. However, where the makers do achieve their aims, is with the emotional aspects, something that lifts Philadelphia to a far higher plain in the pantheon of emotional kickers.The tone of the film is set courtesy of Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning ""Streets Of Philadelphia"", which acts as a sombre portent of things to come during the opening credit sequence. From here on in the story is content with gnawing away at our heart strings and breaking down prejudice barriers in the name of fair play and adult fallibility's. Part court room drama and part human tragedy, Philadelphia is never found wanting in the engrossing department, something that is in no small amount due to the work of a firing on all cylinders cast.Tom Hanks is always pretty safe company to be in as a rule, but tackling the role of Andrew Beckett required much more than merely charm and a homely appeal. Hanks, winning his first Best Actor Oscar, steps up to the plate here and delivers one of the best performances of the 90s. As AIDS ravages his body and soul, Hanks as Andrew reaches deep down within and has the audience with him all the way through his ordeal. Alongside Hanks is Denzel Washington as Joe, who if anything has the more prickly role to contend with. It's probably not much of a surprise to most followers of his to say he's on his usual great form here, with a shift in his character's fortitude showcasing the best of the New Yorker's ability. Rounding out the cast, and with equally fine performances are Jason Robards, Joanne Woodward, Robert Ridgely, Mary Steenburgen and Antonio Banderas. Then as surely as Springsteen's opener had set the mood, Neil Young closes the film down with his own heart achingly brilliant ""Philadelphia"", playing alongside some video footage that finally seals the deal as to why Philadelphia as a movie exists.Revisits to the film show up its minor flaws, but as someone who remembers how he, and the other multi sexed audience reacted on leaving the cinema back in 1993, it's the kind of impact that to my mind can never be understated. 9/10",Philadelphia
16,Doylenf,Brilliant work by Hanks and Washington...but film is not flawless...,7,26 February 2005,"While I was tremendously impressed by PHILADELPHIA when I watched it recently on cable TV, there were some things that bothered me. I thought the courtroom scenes were extremely well done except when it came time for TOM HANKS to take the witness stand. His scenes on the stand, instead of being as dramatic as the other witnesses, merely showed that he was becoming too ill to really give any insight into his character and motivations. Nothing was really revealed about the man himself.Having said that, the other obvious weaknesses were in the script which was a little too contrived at times. Furthermore, Denzel Washington's willingness to overlook his homophobic attitudes and become a buddy to Hanks was just a little too implausible. Then too, the final hospital scene with all of the family gathered around Hanks was not quite convincing.But credit must be given to Jonathan Demme's tasteful direction and to the very fine performances given by the large cast. Jason Robards, Jr. is a standout as the executive seeking to have Hanks dismissed. The only actor shortchanged by the script seems to be ANTONIO BANDERAS who is given little to do and does not really seem a plausible partner for the Hanks character. In other words, they have no chemistry together.As for TOM HANKS, he surely deserved all the awards he received as the lawyer determined to find someone who will fight for his cause. DENZEL WASHINGTON is equally effective in a difficult role, demonstrating once again that he is an actor to watch as he matures with each characterization.Absorbing all the way through--thoughtful, provocative and guaranteed to stir your interest in its delicate handling of a difficult subject.",Philadelphia
17,preppy-3,Dated and dishonest,6,11 March 2002,"I hate to blast this movie because Hanks was so great but...As a gay man I was both horrified and pleased by this film.  For one thing, it dealt with AIDS--I believe this was the first movie like that from a major Hollywood studio.  Also Tom Hanks was absolutely great in the movie. And it looks good and treated gay men rather well (considering it's a major studio film).  Still...this movie does NOT show AIDS as it really is.  I've seen friends die of it so I know what I'm talking about.  Also there is NO affection shown between Hanks and Banderas (they play lovers).  There's one quick kiss and a little hugging--that's it.  Heaven forbid we show them kissing!  That would disgust people!  Also Hanks family being behind him and so noble--COME ON!  NO family like that exists!  They hired a bunch of great actors (especially Joanne Woodward) but I didn't believe them for one second.  Also the anti-gay remarks got to me.  Yeah, I know they're trying to make a point but still...  And all the gays being stereotypically swishy or noble got annoying.  And AIDS is no longer an automatic death sentence.So, the acting is great except for Denzel Washington.  It was a good piece of casting (Washington has admitted that he's homphobic) but he's terrible. Maybe it was hitting him too close to what he's really like.If you want to see a true picture of AIDS get ""Longtime Companion"" or ""It's My Party"".  If you want to see a sanitized, stereotyped, incorrect  version of gays and AIDS, by all means see this.",Philadelphia
18,LeonLouisRicci,Delivering A Safely Packaged Message,7,7 March 2014,"This is one of those Time Capsule Films that is Stuck in the Era when it was Made as Attitudes and Awareness of the Subject, Homosexuality and AIDS, have Changed Dramatically. It was the First Major Hollywood Attempt to Illuminate the Gays and the Disease and in doing so Felt it Necessary to Package it in a Viewer Friendly Picture that Distanced Itself from some Very Disturbing Horrors.The Physical Decrepitation that the Disease Ravages on the Body and the Societal and Personal Prejudices are Touched on Rather Lightly to make it Acceptable for the Main Stream and at the Same Time Deliver some Insight into the Plight of the Lifestyle and some of its Unfortunate Victims.Tom Hanks, Receiving the Oscar, is Shown for Example, as a ""One Partner"" Gay who Strayed Only Once, and not a Multi-Multi Sexual Partner, that Many Homosexual Males Engage in with Sometimes Hundred of Lovers. Of Course this Ups Our Sympathy for Him. Adding in a Safe and Familiar Courtroom Drama to let the Story Unfold is Another Easy Way Out.But Again, this is 1993, Only a few Years After the President, Ronald Reagan Refused to Even Speak the Word AIDS. So it was still a Very Naive Period to Explore these Things, Especially if a Wide Audience was Expected. Overall it is a Noble Mainstream Effort with a Strong Cast and it was Successful in Shining towards that Dark Corner of Middle America where No One Wanted to Look. Today, the Movie seems Even More Safe and Held Back. That is because there has been a Growth of Consciousness and an Evolution of Thinking that was Mostly Absent in Mainstream Thought. The Film can be Given some Credit, for a Small Contribution for Part of that Education.",Philadelphia
19,grantss,Superb,10,19 April 2014,"Superb movie. Moving, intelligent, insightful, and very socially relevant. The central plot may be predictable, but the sub-plots, moral, legal and ethical issues, and pure human drama are far from unoriginal. Moreover, director Jonathan Demme's telling of the story is very sensitively done. Direction is perfect - camera angles (lots of facial close-ups), pacing, editing (no excess scenes, and no spoon-feeding of information) - all are spot-on.Casting is perfect, and the cast delivers in spades. Tom Hanks delivers probably the performance of his life, and considering his incredible acting talent and body of work, that says a lot. He well deserved his Oscar.He is well supported by Denzel Washington, Jason Robards and Antonio Banderas.Surely one of the most socially relevant movies of the 90s, if not of all time.",Philadelphia
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Very powerful and beautiful drama,8,22 June 2004,"Let me start this off by making one thing absolutely clear; I love law movies/court scene films, whatever you want to call them. This film reminded me that something that's even more important than entertaining court scenes in such a film, is an involving subject, to make you really feel that this case is important, crucial; this film shows, once and for all, that a good story, an important subject, makes a good film if executed properly. This film has everything a good film needs; an interesting and emotionally involving plot, a great cast and good cinematography. The plot is great, and it really makes you care about these characters, as they are likable and humane. The acting is all top-notch, especially by Tom Hanks, who gives a stellar performance as the homosexual AIDS-infected lawyer who is fired shortly after being promoted. Denzel Washington also gives a very good performance, portraying a homophobic lawyer. For the reasonably few scenes Antonio Banderas had, he also gave an excellent performance, as Tom's characters boyfriend. The characters are well-written, credible and most important of all, well-played. They are also very well-developed. The film has a very powerful message, and it delivers it well. It takes a very important subject, and shows us both sides of the argument, something reasonably few films do, and even fewer does it as good as this film. It treats the controversial subject with complete respect for both sides, both views. It's one of the most moving films I've ever seen. I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, and pretty much all fans of serious dramas. 8/10",Philadelphia
21,view_and_review,Mayweather/Pacquiao as it should have been,8,7 October 2015,"Philadelphia was an excellent movie but you don't need me to tell you that. It starred two heavy hitters in Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington; so really, what needs more to be said? At that time Tom was sizzling hot. He had done A League of Their Own and Sleepless in Seattle then Philadelphia. He would go on to do Forest Gump, Apollo 13 and others. So, needless to say, Tom Hanks crushed it. He played a challenging role and he played it well.Denzel is Denzel. He may not have a trophy case full of the big awards or the box office dollars that some other lesser actors have, but that's due to his qualitative selection of roles, not his inability to act.I'm just glad I was able to see two heavy weights be on the screen together in their prime. The subject matter was jarring--homosexuality and AIDS--and Hanks and Washington put on a clinic. Only if Mayweather and Pacquiao could've done the same.",Philadelphia
22,evanston_dad,One of the First Mainstream Attempts to Discuss AIDS,7,10 February 2009,"People really look down on ""Philadelphia"" now for being a heavy-handed liberal Hollywood attempt to deal with a ""gay"" issue. But I think it deserves a break. It is heavy handed to be sure, but this is one of the first big mainstream movies with popular mainstream actors I can think of to deal with a topic most of mainstream America wasn't remotely interested in hearing about. It was a pretty big risk for Tom Hanks to ""play gay,"" as that's something that's been known to ruin the careers of others. And say what you will about the movie, it's hard to find fault with Hanks' performance. Though much of the material he was given to work with is sentimental, he navigates it ably and manages to give an affecting performance regardless.Grade: B+",Philadelphia
23,AlsExGal,"Hey, Mr. Hanks, when you are through with that family can I borrow them?",8,4 July 2017,"Seriously, the thing that stood out for me in this film was Andrew Beckett's (Tom Hanks) great family straight out of a Norman Rockwell illustration. His parents are still together after 40 years, he was raised in a large home in a good suburb, he has numerous siblings and numerous nieces and nephews, and all are accepting of his being gay and supportive of his lawsuit when he is apparently sabotaged at work and then fired for incompetence when he believes the law firm partners actually fired him because he had AIDS and was gay.This film was made almost a quarter of a century ago, and I guess to make Beckett sympathetic in those times there had to be nothing negative in his background. Thus the great family, his great intellect and passion for the law, and the solid long term partner in Miguel. His only failing - unprotected sex once in a gay porn theatre while in a relationship with Miguel. Thus the AIDS.There really is no leading lady in this film. Instead, there are two leading men. Andrew Beckett as the plaintiff who cannot find a lawyer to take his case, and Denzel Washington as the attorney who ultimately takes his case, although he is initially scared of Andy, scared of AIDS, repulsed by the idea of gay people. Washington as attorney Joe Miller is portrayed as a devoted family man and flamboyant personal injury lawyer who thinks no plaintiff is too stupid to defend - numerous warning signs, plaintiff ignores them, plaintiff falls into manhole, for example. Yet he will not take Andy's case, initially. It's only after he sees a connection as to how he is treated at the public library for being African American and how Andy is treated there for being obviously ill of AIDS does he change his mind.Where the great acting lies is in the growing friendship between Andy and Joe as they work on the case together. It is a subtle gradual shift in Joe's outlook until at the end, he buys a bottle of Dom Perignon to give to Andy in the hospital when, due to the price, he would not buy a bottle of that same champagne to celebrate the birth of his own child at the beginning of the film.Honorable mention to Jason Robards as the chief partner of the law firm being sued who is more upset about the indignity of being hauled before the Philadelphia legal establishment as a civil defendant than he is about any possible loss of money, and to Joanne Woodward as Andy's mom who keeps a stiff upper lip in front of her son, yet the fact that he is dying in front of her is tearing her up. Sorry Mary Steenburgen, you are a great actress, but you just don't have me believing that you ""hate gays"", but you do have me believing you are a great attorney.Today, lots of the characterizations may leave you feeling like you were hit over the head with a sledge hammer by Captain Obvious, but remember the time frame. People still had preconceived notions about homosexuals as in they must be deviant or have had something in their past that made them ""that way"", and they were definitely scared of AIDS and still not sure it was that hard to contract. Stick around for the great acting by Washington and Hanks and a host of supporting players. And also stick around for the final scene. It will jerk at your heartstrings.",Philadelphia
24,zetes,Pretty bad movie,5,23 April 2001,"You'd think a film with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington would be a pretty good one, right? Well, I know there are plenty of people who hate Tom Hanks, and I was one of them for a long time. Philadephia was actually why I hated Tom Hanks.People are right to call this movie propagandistic, although several of the commenters below are glaring homophobes (what many others don't realize is that propaganda is important, and that most people believe what they believe through propaganda).What I have not seen anyone mention is how terribly homophobic this movie is. I can't believe intelligent people like Jason Robards, Tom Hanks, and Denzel Washington would ever lend their names to Philadelphia, let alone accept an Oscar because of it. I'm talking about two scenes in particular: the scene where we see Tom Hanks contract AIDS (by having sex in a gay porno theater with the man who is sitting next to him) and by having Hanks's character bring Washington to a homosexual party where everyone is dressed in drag. Philadelphia is basically telling the majority of its viewers that, while homosexuals may deserve rights, they are still icky people who do weird things to get their kicks.",Philadelphia
25,Mr-Fusion,Still resonates,8,6 October 2015,"It's hard to ignore the idea that the primary thrust behind ""Philadelphia"" is an entreaty to have a serious talk about AIDS; which meant a lot more back in 1993 when the fear was more palpable. But you can't talk about that disease without also discussing homosexuality, so the movie hasn't lost its compelling edge. And the really nice thing about it is that it plays the material straight and doesn't overdo things (even during the more dramatic moments). This could easily drift into Oscar bait, but it never does (at least, to me). Sure, a lot of it's hard to stomach, but it's some powerful stuff, and characters aren't just cardboard cutouts just dropped in there for the convenient teachable moment. And it's funny how the Oscars work; it's evident that Tom Hanks gave an award-worthy performance (transformation and all), but I was genuinely surprised that Denzel Washington was completely looked over by the Academy. This is one of my favorite Denzel performances.And on the whole, a pretty great movie.8/10",Philadelphia

True Stories on celluloid are magical, because, you witness a true situation in the from of dialogue, and some cinematic liberties.'Philadelphia' is based on the issue mentioned above, and here comes a film that is memorable, sensitive and compelling. Helmed by Veteran Filmmaker Jonathan Demme.Some stories are emotional and Andrew Beckett's story is amongst those. You watch a talented man sulking from AIDS and humiliation, and then fighting for himself. You support him in each step he takes, and try to hold him when he falls down. Your relationship with the would-be-deceased is intact throughout, which makes this saga a memorable watch! Demme's direction, like always, is flawless. One of the most talented filmmakers in recent history! Screenplay by Ron Nyswaner is brilliant, the dialogue are superb. The Soundtrack is legendary, with ""Streets of Philadelphia' by Springsteen and ""Philadelphia' by Neil Young standing out.In the acting department, Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett, in a Multiple Award-Winning Performance, is Incredible. Without a doubt, his careers finest performance! Denzel Washington is superb. It's surprisingly to know he didn't even get a Nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy-Awards! Antonio Banderas also does very well. Mary Steenburgen is wonderfully restrained in her part. Jason Robards is remarkable, like always! Joanne Woodward is efficient.On the whole, 'Philadelphia' is a winner all the way, one of the most memorable films from the early 90's. Two Big Thumbs Up!",Philadelphia

Obviously I can't just give her this website and hope she'll see my review. *giggle* ""Philadelpia"" is a wonderful story. It really has me very impressed with Tom Hanks. He is an amazing actor. Him and Denzel are an incredible duo in the film. I think another thing that gets me so moved about the film is because I have a few homosexual friends who have a hard time being one with the world. So I felt like I could relate somewhat to Denzel's character towards the end. This was a wonderful movie to watch. I would highly recommend it for anyone.10/10",Philadelphia
28,blanbrn,Touching and emotional eye opening legal drama that shows fight for your rights no matter who you are!,9,28 February 2016,"""Philadelphia"" might be 1993's best film for one it's relative for the fact that it was based on a real life case in the city during the 1980's and it's theme of AIDS, discrimination, and homophobia, is downright appealing. And the performances and acting from both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington makes the film a winner as their chemistry is unmatched. From the opening scenes of the city the song from Bruce Springsteen called ""Streets of Philadelphia"" really draws you into the movie.Based on a true story in the city of Philadelphia, Pa Andrew(in Tom Hank's best role)is a hot young lawyer at a big high dollar firm and after years of being with the firm he's suddenly let go. The law firm members claim because of on the job performance yet it's much more it's discrimination and it's because he has AIDS the horrible new disease on the block for gay men especially. So it's a visit to Joe(in a wonderful supporting turn from Denzel Washington)a tough and macho type money hungry ambulance chasing lawyer who takes his case of discrimination by bringing a lawsuit for personal and emotional damages against the high powered law firm. Overall this legal drama turns into a case of courage to overcome bigotry and corruption. The performance from Hanks is one to remember as he proves stand up and fight for rights and equality no matter who you might be.",Philadelphia

30,sddavis63,Brilliant Treatment Of A Sensitive Issue,9,24 June 2002,"An absolutely riveting film starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, who are both superb in this account of a lawyer fired by his law firm because he is a gay man with AIDS.Hanks plays Andrew Beckett, the young hot-shot superstar lawyer who is dismissed by the most prestigious law firm in Philadelphia on a trumped up charge of incompetence after one of the managing partners notices a lesion on his forehead that he recognizes to be caused by AIDS. Forced to take legal action against the firm in what appears to be a no-win situation, Beckett manages to retain the services of Joe Miller (Washington), a somewhat sleazy lawyer who makes a lot of money by hustling personal injury cases. Originally disinclined to accept the case because of his own distaste for homosexuality, Miller becomes committed to the cause and offers a brilliant courtroom performance, while all the while we watch Andrew get sicker and sicker.A strong supporting cast featuring the likes of Antonio Banderas as Andrew's lover Miguel, and Jason Robarts as Charles Wheeler, the head of the firm that fired Andrew, makes this a truly must-see movie. It deals unashamedly with the stereotypes of the day around AIDS and homosexuality. The only weak part of the movie in my opinion was an unnecessarily long scene in which Miller and Beckett are going over testimony, and Beckett is playing opera and interpreting it for Miller. This, I thought, was overdone, but it was the only weak part of the movie I can see.Absolutely brilliant. 9/10.",Philadelphia
31,thesar-2,"Goodnight, AIDS and 20 Years Pass",8,20 June 2013,"While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word – no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The ""fear"" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993.In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals.Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human.Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them.As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew.I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that.It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change – sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark.The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale – yes, I cried""Goodnight. See you tomorrow"" and the Bruce Springsteen song, ""Streets of Philadelphia."" Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music.While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild – I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.",Philadelphia
32,Lejink,Flawed but fascinating social protest movie,6,20 July 2009,"Earnest, engrossing and certainly brave but in my opinion flawed film giving us mainstream Hollywood's reaction to the AIDS outbreak amongst the gay community. The film makes a strong case against bigotry in general, but for me at times fails its subject somewhat by occasionally using too broad strokes in making its points.I'm obviously watching this film some 16 years now after its original release and would like to think that society has moved on at least a little since then so that some of the repulsive prejudices here wouldn't be tolerated today, but the film maintains its relevance, mainly of course because society hasn't and in all likelihood never will full accept the gay community as equals (consider the US Army still refusing to recruit openly gay soldiers).The movie opens with an almost guided tour of different sites of the city of Philadelphia where people gather, to no doubt bolster the image of the cultural diversity and tolerance of its reputed broad minded populace. It's against this backdrop that Tom Hanks' AIDS-afflicted upwardly mobile city lawyer makes his brave stand against an obviously contrived dismissal. Turned down by every other legal practice in the city when seeking to prosecute an unfair dismissal case, he eventually hooks up with an old adversary, an ""ambulance-chasing"" litigation-specialist lawyer, the overtly homophobic Denzel Washington to take on the venerable partners of his old firm, in particular the formerly patrician senior partner, played by Jason Robards.Whilst the movie held me throughout and was never less than entertaining, I have some major caveats with the portrayal of some characters and some of the scenes depicted. It's noticeable immediately of course that the director felt unable to show any physical intimacy between Hanks and his lover Miguel, played by Antonio Banderas. That said it took Hollywood another 15 years for its first gay-kiss between men in ""Brokeback Mountain"" and if to turn a cliché, a journey of a hundred miles starts with a single step, then ""Philadelphia"" played its part, especially when prejudices were arguably more ingrained than today. I liked the idea of Hanks' case being taken on by a black man, obviously no stranger to discrimination but with deeply held bias of his own and enjoyed the movie best in the courtroom scenes, well played by all the principals.The device of the prosecution and defence attorneys directly addressing the jury and hence we the viewers face-on was also effective but against this we get Hanks' frankly embarrassing ""drip-dance"" to the strains of Maria Callas which is overplayed in the extreme. I could have done with a little of the similarly over-egged family scenes, (especially the ""home-movie"" footage too obviously tugging at the heart-strings. Worst of all was the over-dramatic collapse of Hanks' character at the crux of the trial, Hollywood betraying its predilection for melodramatic climaxes.Take nothing away from the actors however. Hanks in particular deserved his Oscar for a well-rounded depiction of, if not an ordinary average guy, (an opera loving, city slicker lawyer, anyone?), certainly a believable character, not without fault (tacitly highlighted with revelation of Hanks' one-night stand while still in his relationship with Banderas). Washington, in the less showy and less well-written role of Hanks' defence acquits himself well and the heavyweight turns by the likes of Robards, Joanne Woodward (who doesn't get much to do in all honesty) and the under-appreciated Mary Steenburgen.There are many interesting minor-characters on show whose stories might have borne more scrutiny, not least the sole senior partner who displays remorse for the corporate decision and Hanks' erstwhile colleagues caught between a rock and a hard place in giving their difficult testimony. Special plaudits too must go to the rock stars Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young who contributed the two telling songs which book-end the movie so effectively. Springsteen's lyric, in particular demonstrates a potent empathy (...and my clothes don't fit me no more..."") with the subject which often eludes the director on the screen. All in all then, certainly an epochal movie, let down in terms of credibility and ultimately as entertainment by too obvious concessions to the considerations of on the one hand the box-office and on the other, the censorship laws of the day.",Philadelphia
33,ElMaruecan82,Inspirational message about the values of life ... and the value of life ...,9,1 August 2012,"If I could describe ""Philadelphia"" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: ""modern society's general intolerance against AIDS"" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, ""Philadelphia"" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding.And that's why ""Philadelphia"" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. ""Philadelphia"" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life.These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward ""Philadelphia"", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful ""Silence of the Lambs"" two years later). The fact is that ""Philadelphia"" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic ""Streets of Philadelphia"" and Neil Young's tear-jerking ""Philadelphia"" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is ""Philadelphia""'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people.And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of ""Philadelphia"".",Philadelphia
34,ThomasDrufke,Hanks and Denzel Give Legendary Performances,8,23 March 2014,"Impression- Being one of the first mainstream movies to tackle the AIDS/Homophobic topic, it does a great job at bringing both sides to the story. It shows the reality that there were quite a few people not okay being around Gay's. This is an issue that still exists today, which is why the movie will live on for many years to come. It also didn't remind me of any other AIDS related movies, which makes it unique.Praise- This movie contains 2 of the best performances that Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks have given in their career. At the time Hanks wasn't known for many dramatic roles as he was primarily in comedic roles. Obviously now we know him as one of the greatest actors of all time. Hanks really does pull off the emotional side very well. As for Washington, I really liked that they didn't just make him right away erase his homophobia. For a man who was raised a certain way I would have had a hard time believing him automatically accepting the case. So I'm glad that even at times during the case he admitted he's still bothered by homosexuals. Antonio Banderas was decent with limited screen time, but the real stars were Hanks and Washington. I'm very surprised Denzel wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year. Could have been because it rarely happens that 2 actors from the same movie both get lead nominations. Considering this movie involves him as much as it involved Hanks.Complaints (Minor)- Throughout the movie there are weird camera angles. And I actually found myself distracted at times. it seemed like the director/cinematographer decided they wanted to shoot this movie with as many close ups as possible on each actor. It was like in TV shows when actors look directly into the camera and break the 'Fourth Wall', well this movie often showed the actors looking into the camera probably for dramatic effect, which didn't really add much. Another minor complaint was the pacing. I felt it started off intriguing but then for a good 30 minutes it felt slow and barely involved the lead character. Jonathan Demme is usually good with this, as in Silence of the Lambs, its paced perfectly.Final Thoughts- It's a very good movie, with legendary performances from the lead, but wasn't perfect. Its good for anyone who likes Tom Hanks, or was interested in the story of how some people with AIDS were mistreated. 8.1/10",Philadelphia

I heard of this movie before, but I never had the intention of seeing it despite two of my favorite actors playing leads.

He turns to Joe Miller to help him win a lawsuit against his former company.The acting is marvelous. Tom Hanks has been a very good actor for many years. The same can be said about Denzel.

36,lesleyharris30,"Dated and Cheesy, but the Performances Shine,",7,20 February 2016,"Philadelphia is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. The highlight of the film and the thing that holds it all together is without a doubt the performances, Tom Hanks is a down on his luck homosexual, he is believable in every moment, a well deserved Oscar win. Denzel Washington also shines as his homophobic lawyer who is still willing to win his case, the bond that forms between them throughout the movie is terrific and the main reason I did not rate this lower. My main disappointment was that it was, to put it bluntly, cheesy, we are expected to care for these characters before we even know anything about them, and it was clear that the director was hoping to have us in tears. The delivery of the emotional scenes was too straight forward that you could not get teary eyed. This may not be a problem for some viewers, but I found it very dated, it's hard to get sucked in to a story about gay rights when that has improved so much today, as well as that it portrays AIDS as a deadly disease, which of course it was back then, but today it's not a big deal which makes it harder to feel genuine concern for Andrew. While it has many imperfections, the performances are terrific and if you're a fan of Hanks and Washington, which you certainly should be, then it's worth the watch. When a gay lawyer is unfairly fired from work, he hires a homophobic man to take the case. Best Performance: Tom Hanks",Philadelphia
37,secondtake,"Once an important movie for its content, now mostly notable for Tom Hanks, who goes for broke",7,3 May 2010,"Philadelphia (1993)Tom Hanks pulls out all the stops in this performance as a man, Andrew Beckett, dying of AIDS in the 1980s. If the courtroom battle about his rights to keep working is the driving plot, the real drama and tragedy is in the decay and death of this talented, likable man. Coming to his legal aid is Denzel Washington, who could charm the slippers off of Dorothy, and he does his best to win over the jury. But more important than his lawyering is his openly anti-gay feelings, which he has to face in himself as he gets fully absorbed in the trial.Director Jonathan Demme is a quirky director coming out of the independent film atmosphere of Roger Corman in the early 1970s, but this is a conventional movie in every way. Even his Silence of the Lambs two years earlier had a filming style and some plot elements that pushed the medium a little. So it's safe to say that there is no distraction in Philadelphia from the one thing that matters, the struggle of Beckett to survive, with dignity. In fact, it depends on its utterly ordinary feel to succeed among a wide audience.Like Brokeback Mountain (an Ang Lee film), Philadelphia is a breakthrough for the ordinary person. The themes in both films (being a gay cowboy, or dying of AIDS) were things not easily talked about or understood by many people, and many of these people went to the movie and had to come face to face with it. By not making Philadelphia sensational in any way (gay sex, for example, is only mentioned in passing), it became completely mainstream. And the two leads and the director are not homosexual, so it isn't a ""gay"" movie. For that large audience, at that time, the film was really important and probably a deep experience.But for many others who have already absorbed the facts and meaning of the content of the film, the man dying and the trial, the movie is more ordinary, with some common plot advances and side events. Time has made these facts a proved history, and they lack controversy. On its own, Philadelphia is a well made but formulaic movie. But Tom Hanks? His performance really is extraordinary, and that will stand the test of time.",Philadelphia
38,Irishchatter,A very inspiring movie about Aids...,9,26 July 2015,"You can easily shed a tear watching this because it's so sad you were fired because of homosexuality discrimination involved in the workplace. God I felt so sorry for Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett, he had a lot on his plate. He was a tough cookie in all of this stress that he's been through with.I also was astonished but relived that Denzel Washington's character Joe Miller took on the case because he really used a lot of name calling and he dismissed Andrew the first time he requested this case. My god, the poor fella was dying, he didn't need to be denied, he needed to be accepted just like any client that Joe backed up for!I have to say, this film makes you think that you should look into more information about Aids and that you should never ever diss anyone who has aids.",Philadelphia
39,ironhorse_iv,"I adore, the City of Brotherly Love. Philadelphia is a heartfelt and beautiful movie.",8,23 March 2016,"This movie made me cry like a baby when I first saw it, and still does now. It shows humanity, compassion, love and loss. People really can be beautiful if they try just a little. This ground-breaking, historically-significant, and realistic film from director, Jonathan Demme was one of the first major mainstream studio produce films to confront the AIDS issue from a medical, political, and societal point of view. Inspired by the true stories of attorneys Geoffrey Bowers & Clarence B. Cain, who, successfully sued the law firm that fired them in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases of wrongful dismissal. The movie loosely create a similar fictional story of a gay lawyer, Andrew Becket (Tom Hanks), having to sue his law firm over job discrimination when he got contracted with HIV/AIDS virus, with the help of a personal injury lawyer/friend, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington). Written by Ron Nyswaner, the movie had some controversy when it was first released, because how similar, the fictional story of Philadelphia was to Geoffrey Bowers. The family of Bowers, sued the writers and producers of the film, because of this, but it was quickly settled out of court. Although this movie was well-intentioned and compelling, it was also criticized by gay groups at the time, for the studio trying to attempted to block the casting of the HIV-positive, actor Ron Vawternote , until director Jonathan Demme pointed out how hypocritical this would be in the face of the film's message. Another thing, that got gay groups mad, is downplaying the affectionate romance between Andrew Becket and his lover, Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas); as well, as not allowing the character to seem like anything less than the patron saint of AIDS victims. Yes, the character seem like American Boy Scout, however, in my opinion, I don't mind, the many compromises for mainstream audiences. After all, it got me, to watch the movie, when I wouldn't have watch it, otherwise. If anything, the main character of the film is arguably Joe, as he is the one to go through character development. It's nice to see him, warm up to the idea of helping Andrew, without feeling too preachy. Coming after HBO-TV docu-drama, 'And the Band Played On' about the growing AIDS crisis. The presence of two major American straight actors, Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington really helped to broaden awareness about the problematic disease. It also help bridged actor Tom Hanks' earlier career as a comedian to the more sober and serious side of his dramatic career. Tom Hanks is amazing in this role. The fact that Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role, shows how committed he was, to the role. He really gave a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar. I'm pretty glad, he did win, Best Actor that year. I also love the fact that Hanks' Oscar acceptance speech, also help inspired the conflict in 1997's In & Out. It's also funny to hear that Denzel Washington, on the other hand, was asked to gain a few pounds for his role. Washington, to the chagrin of Hanks, who practically starved himself for the role, would often eat chocolate bars in front of him. Wow, what a joker! The drama also made effective use of the music. 'Philadelphia' has some of the best music, made for a film. Composer Howard Shore's 'Precedent"" is still one of the purest track I have ever heard. Then, there are the fans and critic's favorite song, 'Streets of Philadelphia' by singer, Bruce Springsteen whom music video and the opening of the movie, able to shows the city in all its aspects — both the bright, shiny downtown landmarks, and the poor areas — minority, homeless, urban blight, and decay. While, it is a tear-jerking song. In my opinion, the song that deserve the Oscar, wasn't Bruce Springsteen, but music artist, Neil Young's song, 'Philadelphia'. In my opinion, the film without Neil Young's song, wouldn't have touched as many as it did, because of it. That song still makes me cry, when I hear it. It's such as a beautiful journey of emotional. Overall: This groundbreaking and moving drama is absolutely astonishing. A must watch for anybody with a heart.",Philadelphia
40,slightlymad22,This Movie Changed Tom Hanks Career,9,8 December 2014,"This movie changed Tom Hanks career from silly (but enjoyable) comedies to Oscar winner and candidate for all the top scripts, Plot In A Paragraph: When successful Philadelphia lawyer Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is fired for alleged incompetence, he believes it is because his employers found out he had AIDS. When nobody will take his case, he turns to homophobic, small time TV lawyer Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to sue for wrongful dismissal.What needs to be bared in mind when watching this movie now, if you have not seen it before, is that when this was released AIDS was still a death sentence, it was an incurable disease that had recently claimed the life of rock legend Freddie Mercury. The discrimination, fear, prejudice and panic reaction was really what it was like.Giving a career best performance, Tom Hanks deservedly won the Oscar for this movie, and in reality he could have won it in many other years too. His performance is THAT good. Denzel Washington, who I'm not really a fan of, because in every movie he is in, race comes in to it. And this movie is no exception and it is the fuel behind him taking Beckett's case, after initially turning him down for ""personal reasons"" as he sees Beckett receiving the same kind of discrimination he has faced all his life. Ron Vawter (who was actually dying of AIDS himself when he made this movie) is also excellent, as is Antonio Banderas (in his first good role) as Miguel, Beckett's boyfriend.Bruce Springsteen also deservedly won the Oscar for his brilliant song ""Streets Of Philadelphia"".",Philadelphia
41,Dr_Coulardeau,This film cannot age,10,18 September 2013,"The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it.A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible.The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination.The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions.The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it.The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script.This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people.And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Philadelphia
42,zkonedog,"Not Quite Epic, But Will Make You Think",7,11 March 2017,"Over the last few years, I have been churning my way through the films of Denzel Washington. I love the intensity and passion he brings to his roles, plus the fact that, ""Manchurian Candidate"" aside, he hasn't really been in any bad films. For whatever reason, I had not yet seen ""Philadelphia"", which is hailed by film critics and garnered Tom Hanks a Best Actor academy award in 1992. After viewing, I found it to be not as epic as some would have me believe, but still an interesting two hours nonetheless.The basic plot of the film is the story of two lawyers (Denzel and Hanks). Hanks' character contracts AIDS and enlists the help of ""Washington"" to help him file a discrimination lawsuit against the company that fired him (supposedly due to the disease). Along the way, the plot actually morphs to become more of a ""panel discussion"" on the treatment/perception of gay people in the United States.In dealing with such a sensitive topic, the film is able to lay out its message without sounding too crass or too offensive to either side. Basically, director Jonathan Demme knows that viewers will obviously have pre-determined attitudes about the issue before viewing the film, and thus doesn't try to sway any perceptions. Instead, through the legal, court-room setting, he just invites both sides to think about the issues at hand and consider possible scenarios. I liken it to a more recent Denzel Washington film entitled ""The Great Debaters"", which discussed the issue of the Jim Crow south through a high school debate team. Some pretty meaty issues were thrown around, but under the guise of ""debate"" the viewers don't really feel any compulsion to take a side, instead just being privy to the information. A similar factor is what I believe is the true brilliance of Demme's film...he treats the viewers like a jury and allows us to come to our own conclusion about the issues he is discussing.Thus, unless you have incredibly strong feelings one way or the other about the issue of gay rights (then the film is bound to upset in its generalization of the topic), I would recommend this film to pretty much anyone. While it may not live up to critical hype (likely due to the fact that critics are usually bonkers over artsy or heavy-themed films), it will give you some things to think about.",Philadelphia
43,Red-125,Still a powerful movie after 25 years,10,22 October 2017,"Philadelphia (1993) was directed by Jonathan Demme. The AIDS epidemic started in the early 1980's, and movies about AIDS started to appear in the mid-1980s. However, to my knowledge, Philadelphia was the first high-budget, mainstream film about AIDS to appear on the screen.TriStar certainly provided the funds to attract an all-star cast. Tom Hanks portrays brilliant lawyer Andrew Beckett. When Beckett is fired from his high-prestige law firm, no lawyer wants to touch his case for wrongful dismissal. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller, who agrees to represent Beckett. (Joe is himself uncomfortable with AIDS. However, he knows injustice when he sees it.) Antonio Banderas plays Beckett's loving partner, Miguel Alvarez. Jason Robards is perfectly cast as Charles Wheeler, Beckett's mentor until he becomes Beckett's enemy. All four men are superstars, and it's easy to see why.The film doesn't just have star power in the leading roles. Great actors like Roberta Maxwell and Joanne Woodward have small supporting roles.The movie is courageous in facing AIDS directly. In the 1980's and 1990's, people distinguished between ""good AIDS"" and ""bad AIDS."" Good AIDS was AIDS that people contracted from blood transfusions. So, the thought was that these people were innocent victims.Bad AIDS came from (mostly) men having sex with men. In retrospect, we can see the moral error in this good vs. evil judgment. But, at the time, gay sex was considered evil, and many people thought that gay men with AIDS deserved the disease. How this prejudice played out inside and outside the courtroom represents the plot of the movie. It's very strong and truly heart-wrenching.We saw this film at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY. It was shown at Rochester's wonderful ImageOut, the LGBT Film Festival. Almost all of the movies shown at ImageOut are new, cutting-edge films. Philadelphia was shown under the heading, ""ImageOut of the Archives."" The movie was made almost 25 years ago, and it's being shown again to mark that anniversary.Philadelphia is an important film, and shouldn't be missed. It will work very well on the small screen. Find it and watch it. (Or, as I did, watch it again.)P.S. Mary Steenburgen has a supporting role as Belinda Conine, the attorney representing Beckett's former law firm. I can't remember when an actor has made so strong an impression in a relatively small role. She's just what you'd expect in this context--brilliant, eloquent, with a heart that has no room for conscience or remorse. She knows that the law firm had dismissed Beckett because he had AIDS. However, that's not going to stop her in the least. It's not even going to slow her down.",Philadelphia

45,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Both a touching and pioneering courtroom and human drama,8,1 September 2008,"Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, perhaps the most revered white and black male actors of their generation, respectively -- in a film about homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic. That's the easiest thing to overlook and perhaps the most brilliant part about ""Philadelphia:"" Never once do you feel an ounce of racial tension between their two characters in this film. It's as if to say that we've broken a social barrier like this before and we'll do it again.The film follows Hanks as Andrew Beckett, a young stud lawyer in a major Philadelphia firm who learns his HIV has become AIDS just as he is promoted. Before long, Beckett finds himself fired for incompetency, though he believes it is based on his disease. He seeks the help of Joe Miller, a civil attorney, who at first turns him away due to his own homophobia, but later accepts. The film sort of baits us on our interest in courtroom drama and challenge us with some reflective, personal, human moments. While the film is about this legal battle, ""Silence of the Lambs"" filmmaker Jonathan Demme makes sure to remind you that its really about a man and his family struggling with a terrible disease.The genius of the script is that it blatantly plays on American prejudices about homosexuality and AIDS, reminding us of our ignorance about the virus and its disease in the way that it is contracted most specifically. We are supposed to come at it from Joe's perspective, slowly coming to understand that our homophobia is unfounded. It's not flawless execution as some of the ignorance feels artistically forced, but most of it is very real. This is one of those movies that uses such a sharp societal lens that it will leave you with ""shaken head syndrome' where you can't help but shake your head based on how terrible and prejudiced some of the things said and done in this film are.""Philadelphia"" definitely seems to be on the upward portion near the climax of the illustrious acting careers of both Hanks and Washington. While best actor awards tend to make people think of the most dramatic performances, it is the way Hanks shows the debilitating effects of the disease through the course of the film that makes him Oscar-worthy. Washington's performance is familiar, but what makes it stand out a bit is that transformation in perspective we see him undergo.This is a story driven by content and meant to play toward emotions. It is meant to be sad and uplifting, both of which it is. It is a landmark film in its willingness to address AIDS and homosexuality in the ""pre-RENT"" era of entertainment. While it is a courtroom drama and meant to handle a serious subject matter, its more simplistic and raw than profound and artistic. ""Philadelphia"" is a very important story sandwiched between a great Bruce Springsteen song and a good Neil Young song that belongs among the library of issue-focused films",Philadelphia
46,imseeg,"Sentimental Hollywood drama. Too much sugarcoated for my taste, but excellently performed by Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington.",7,11 August 2018,"Slowburning courtdrama about Tom Hanks sueing his boss for being fired because he has got Aids. Not suited for those who want to see a cheery Tom Hanks movie, because ""Philadelphia"" is serious stuff, but very enticing nonetheless, for those who like hours long of courtroom dialogues intermixed with sentimental scenes of Tom Hanks dying of Aids. Despite this seemingly depressing story it is still a feel good movie, but one with a few heartwrenching tears.Acting is really terrific. I think it is one of the best dramatic roles Tom Hanks has ever played. Because of that I have to skip some parts of the movie because I would otherwise get to emotional and teary eyed. There are some really grand dramatic scenes which give me goosebumps just thinking about them. Director Jonathan Demme really made one of his best work in his entire carreer with ""Philadelphia"". His other masterpiece would be the well known ""Silence of the Lambs"". Jonathan Demma has got the talent to make characters become real life like. And in ""Philadelphia"" that means that we get to share the struggle of Tom Hanks close up, as if we were his family. Very touching.
You gotta understand that this movie was released in the nineties, a period in which Aids was still often wrongfully being associated with homosexuals. Lots of fear and repulsion of Aids expressed by characters in the movie doesnt make sense nowadays anymore. Everybody now knows Aids is not a disease of homosexuals solely. Everybody knows that you dont get contaminated with Aids by just shaking hands or hugging. But all these negative prejudices were still floating around in mass media back in the nineties. For that reason this movie has become a bit dated now, although it was rather groundbreaking back then, certainly for Hollywood standards. How many big box office movies about homosexuals are out there? Just a tiny few. This fight for equal rights for homosexuals which is portrayed in this movie still makes it worth watching nowadays, because discrimination is still rampant. My only real criticism of this movie is that it still remains a cliche Hollywood movie which has to be sold to the masses and therefore a lot of sugarcoated melodrama is added to the story. Although the balance between sugarcoated sentiment and real drama is balanced fairly enough to please both the feel good loving masses and those who long for more true to life drama.",Philadelphia
47,jzappa,An American Story,10,12 October 2010,"When it's used in a statistical sense, the term ""minorities"" refers to what is small in number, less than the majority. Over time, it's become a handy awning tag under which many groups can be filed. But it's a deceptive categorization. It deludes those accepting the pigeonholing into viewing people called minorities as small not only in number but also in significance. In a democratic nation based on majority rule, such a classification can make the benefit and concerns raised by minorities seem less significant than those of the majority. Besides, more and more the label is not statistically truthful. For example, depending on how one adds together a given demographic in certain cities and states, there is no single majority.At the same time it was the height of what is already being considered manipulative emotional effect and sardonically designed buoyancy, 1993 seemed to foreshadow a progressive fashion in Hollywood, after the pervading Reaganite camp of the 1980s, which met audiences head-on with real and communal truths having to do with things the majority would rather not think about so much. Released the same year as Spielberg's Schindler's List, yet the most critically and commercially extolled konk on the head for everybody to truly take a hard look at what happened during the Holocaust, came this impressively directed effort, more than ten years after ""gay cancer"" first became public knowledge. There had been extremely good films made about being gay in America during that time, like the deeply touching Torch Song Trilogy or the heartrending Longtime Companion, as well as quite a few before the AIDS epidemic, but they hadn't reached an audience as wide as Philadelphia. Inspired by the story of an HIV-positive attorney who in 1987 sued an international law firm for unfair dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases, the film was the second big-budget, big-star Hollywood film to tackle the issue of AIDS in the U.S. and also signaled a shift in the early 1990s for Hollywood films to have more realistic depictions of gays and lesbians. And yet somehow, as Hanks remarked in an interview for the vital 1996 documentary The Celluloid Closet, some scenes showing more affection between him and Banderas had to be cut.Jonathan Demme is an influential director across an array of genres, and whereas his previous films seem to have been about embracing life, Philadelphia is preoccupied with death and dying, but he nevertheless infuses it with authentic joy and generosity, as well as his eye and ear for music. This is a Hollywood production that would've fit right in with its era of pat sentiment and cynically calculated optimism, but Demme makes it all feel genuine and moving. His use of music allows for the pleasure of the story to be individualized and shared at the same time. Grabbing at the soul of each moment with his trademark use of characters looking straight into the camera, Demme uses the emotional meaning of every shot, not just manipulating the temporal length or rhythmic characteristics of the cuts. He elicits a reaction from us even more complex than if he were to paste one static shot to the next based on the literal beginning and ending of each.The performances in Philadelphia all seem to reflect the personal histories of each character, perhaps because each scene gives them another situation to respond to, changing the course of their thoughts, feelings or actions. Everyone is human here. Maybe that's why, as a classic contemporary Hollywood feel-good tearjerker, it transcends so many of those corresponding conventions. No one's there to be a prop to act upon the ""good guys,"" who themselves are far from perfect. Everybody---from the underdog hero to the friends and families of the central figures, from the ignorant but humanist attorney to the smallest player in the courtroom---has opinions and feelings, consequences, they change, they carry things forward, such is life.Demme's best films hum with that loving vibe that everyone knew they were all making the same film. That they were allowed to make mistakes, that they were allowed to try things. The acting is strong because it's fresh, simple, honest, emotionally alive, moment-by-moment. And precisely and equally so is Demme's camera. It never just rolls. It's never just coverage. It's always specific. It captures the essence of each moment, stops time, changes space, defines characters, creates beauty, ugliness: It truthfully and sensitively tells the story. And it leaves a residual warmth in your frame of mind for some time upon finishing it.",Philadelphia
48,Turfseer,Slightly sanitized tale of corporate attorney suffering from AIDS still hits the mark as welcome plea for tolerance,6,25 April 2020,"Philadelphia! The old chestnut starring Tom Hanks in his heyday-a film in which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. With the late Jonathan Demme directing, it's an earnest ""feel-good"" but bittersweet movie about corporate lawyer Andrew Beckett (Hanks), who sues his law firm after being fired for allegedly almost bungling an important case by misplacing some important court documents. It's all undoubtedly a set-up as the partners at the firm led by the mean head honcho Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards) really have it in for him because he's gay and has AIDS.Despite being well-regarded at the firm prior to the inciting incident where he misplaces the court documents, Beckett is unceremoniously dumped by his superiors in a brief meeting. Beckett then searches for an attorney to represent him in a discrimination lawsuit against the firm. After going through numerous attorneys who have no interest in taking his case, he finds Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), an African-American, somewhat homophobic personal injury attorney, who is well known in the city as an ""ambulance chaser,"" through numerous TV ads.You might guess that Miller's character arc leads to an epiphany about gay people as his disdain transforms into mutual respect as he gets to know Beckett. Washington perhaps has the more interesting role as his transformation is visible. Hank's character is more static, eventually ending up succumbing to his illness. Nonetheless Hanks does well in eliciting sympathy for Beckett, who comes off as a ""regular"" guy. This is important as Hanks' performance did much to promote the idea of tolerance, especially in reference to gay people at the time, many of whom were discriminated against due to being afflicted with a widely publicized ""malevolent"" illness.Still, the narrative appears to be sanitized a bit to present Beckett as a little too ""clean."" During the trial, it's brought out during cross-examination that he had a sexual encounter on only one occasion at a gay movie house, which is perhaps the only significant reference to his sexuality. Little is made of Beckett's partner Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas) who's seen only giving Beckett a peck on the cheek (and not even one passionate kiss!). I understand a scene of them in bed was cut.The most compelling part of the film involves the actual trial in which Beckett's old law firm argues that ultimately he lost his edge as a young, crackerjack attorney, to the point where he became incompetent. Witnesses are unable to tarnish Beckett's image of true competence, despite the performance by Belinda Conine, the firms's pitbull-like attorney played by Mary Steenburgen (at one point we hear her sotto voce exclaiming how she hates her job going after Beckett during the trial-as if the real Mary Steenburgen requested the line be put in, to remind people she's not homophobic in real life!).Jason Robards tries his best to humanize Charles Wheeler, the awful misogynist and homophobe, but he's really too much of a villain to be taken as a rounded out character (a little more complexity might have been in order, despite the fact that some of his utterances have a familiar, despicable ring).Still, despite its imperfections, Philadelphia's plea for tolerance was a welcome statement at the time. Despite the obvious sanitization, Hanks creates a believable portrait sticking up for his rights during a time of true suffering.",Philadelphia

(Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms.

It holds our hand a bit more than is really necessary, and tirelessly beats us over the head with its point, but it feels like that sort of treatment was somewhat necessary for such a controversial issue in the early '90s. Tom Hanks is revelatory in the lead role, balancing his usual bubbling vat of character with a potent, hard-edged determination to fight for the justice he's due. Not to harp on the morality of the times too much, but I don't think it can be understated how important this casting was, both for the film and its lead actor. The level of good-natured, approachable personality that Hanks wears on his chest is crucial to humanizing the character, making him more than just the sick, faceless member of an alien culture. That we'd laughed with him so many times already makes it all the more powerful to see him near death, struggling to remain upright in bed as the disease ravages his body. Denzel Washington fails to keep pace as his moderately scummy, though well-spoken lawyer, an awkward personification of the ugly, ignorant target audience, but he nails a few convincing courtroom speeches and has his come-to-Jesus moment, which is all we really need from the role.

Denzel Washington plays alongside Hanks as the personal injury attorney Andy has enlisted to represent him in a case of wrongful dismissal he intends to bring against his former employers. The two leads do give quality showings, but both have been much better. Jason Robards and Mary Steenburgen lend support equally worthy of praise.While Ron Nyswaner's script tackles an interesting issue, it is the controversial topics it seemingly neglects that really let it down, such as the issue of family acceptance which appears to be totally ignored. The Beckett clan seem to wholeheartedly accept Andy for what and who he is without question, hardly a likely scenario. The other disappointment of course is director Demme's failure to create a powerful and impacting movie from the potentially devastating material which he had at his disposal.""Philadelphia"" is still a good movie however, as it grapples with a subject which was long overdue an audience.

Films involving prejudice weren't that usual in nineties, and fortunately this one has been done-- and in good style. Whilst several of the decade's courtroom dramas were centered in corruption and crime, this one used the subject prejudice to have an employment suit. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are very believable in their roles, thought Banderas wasn't that good. In the end the filmmakers chose for the easiest way to make the audience cry; when the protagonist died, they exposed old pictures and videotapes of him in the beach with his family, giving a nostalgic feeling that will probably make you cry or be depressed for big time.

63,philip_vanderveken,Thanks to the strong performances and the story this movie has become a classic in the genre,8,11 January 2005,"Philadelphia could have been just another court room drama and then no-one would have noticed it if it hadn't had such big actors in its cast. But this one is different thanks to its subject.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is a gay lawyer with AIDS who has lost his job at a conservative law firm because of his disease. He knows he has a case against his former employer, but no other lawyer dares to defend him, except for one. Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) is a homophobic small time lawyer who decides to defend him anyway, only because the law has been broken, not because he likes Beckett all that much.Like I already said, this movie could have gone by unnoticed, but it didn't. I guess you have to be extremely homophobic or you've got to have a heart of stone if you aren't touched by it. Not only the story, but also the images are very powerful. You see how his health gets worse as the story progresses and you can almost feel his suffering. This movie would have been OK anyway thanks to the good direction and the story, but it is thanks to the great performances of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington that this movie has become an icon. Even Antonio Banderas, who isn't know for his excellent movies, was more than just good in this one.All in all, thanks to the strong performances and the good story this movie has become a classic in the genre that should be seen by everybody.

64,screenman,"So Very, Very Right On",5,16 June 2009,"This movie was made when AIDS was still regarded in the light of the 'gay plague' that statistics suggested it to be. The statistics were entirely plausible, but things have moved on.Tom Hanks plays, very convincingly, a young, homosexual, hot-shot lawyer who steadfastly does not want to 'come out' because of the inevitable prejudice, but is forced to do so because of his being infected with HIV and the symptoms becoming evident. Somebody at the office tips the wink and a scam of incompetence is set-up as justification to sack him. He thinks that's unfair.He goes in search of a lawyer to help him, but finds closed doors until a small-time ambulance-chaser - played by ever-reliable Denzel Washington - takes pity and offers to represent his efforts. Cue a court-room drama.Although the movie is well directed, edited and equally well-paced, with largely creditable acting performances from lots of old, familiar regulars; it has an extremely banal script, whilst the plot itself is a predictable done-deal. Formulaic hardly describes it.It looks as though somebody has gone to the props department, taken the sack marked 'cliches' and poured the contents out all over the screen. You know just how it's going to end from the sight of Hanks' very first lesion. The court case is inevitable, and he must win. Though it'll be a pyrrhic victory because he's going to die. The initially prejudiced lawyer will overcome his bigotry and learn to love homosexuals. Instead of just fighting the case for money - he'll begin fighting for JUSTICE! Yeah, man; right on. Everyone in the courtroom (and presumably the audience) will have a 'Damascus' moment.We are shown how sensitive this homosexual man is, by his almost tearful appreciation of a tragic operatic aria, which Washington - being a heterosexual - doesn't understand. His testosterone has apparently deprived him of an interest in opera. We are shown how Denzel Washington's seemingly rational fear of catching a terrible, infectious, and fatal disease is, in truth, just an irrational distaste for the act of buggery. And so on. I have watched this movie 2 or 3 times now, because I like the intellectual conflicts of courtroom drama, but it has become evident how the entire script and conduct of the case has been predicated to emphasise its right-on message, reinforcing the apparent narrow-mindedness of heterosexuals. To this extent it is almost a subtle piece of propaganda. Every effort is made to highlight the hypocrisy of Hanks' former colleagues and in doing so that of (straight) society as a whole. Very little is made of the fact that this 'victim' caught the disease as a result of his own reckless behaviour, participating in lewd conduct with complete strangers, whilst living (and engaging in sexual activity with) a male partner. The partner did not himself become infected. But that was no credit to Hanks' character. He might also have been facing a hideous death as a result of this man's cavalier irresponsibility, his contemptuous and cynical disregard for another's safety. So; it would seem that he can betray his best friend to the extent of perhaps forfeiting the friend's life, but his employers can't betray him to the extent of forfeiting his job. No hypocrisy there then. On another occasion, Denzel Washington, as lawyer, makes a comparison with a paraplegic (the law, it would seem, having inexplicably defined AIDS as a disability). But no counter-comparison is made of the fact that paraplegia is at least neither fatal nor contagious. Hanks's character has also breached the terms of his employment contract by failing to advise the company of a change in his medical condition, but it seems we can draw a veil over that as well. I could go on. At the very least, Hanks' character should be facing charges of reckless endangerment with respect to his partner. Whilst his employers should be free to countersue for breach of trust. But the subject matter of this movie is such that anything less than its wholehearted endorsement is likely to be lambasted as an expression of so-called 'homophobia'. It nevertheless has more the appearance of an advocacy rather than entertainment. I, for one, don't much care for being told what to think.Worth a watch, but far better movies of the genre are to be found. My favourite (at the moment) is 'The Rainmaker'. The case is more convincing and the lawyer jokes are better.",Philadelphia

Unable to find an attorney due to his condition, he enlists the help of a personal injury lawyer Joe Miller (Washington) to assist him in the case.Philadelphia fell thoroughly nothing short of a timely and deeply riveting story, and succeeds at both a courtroom drama and a family drama. This film boasts some enthralling performances from a stellar cast including Antonio Banderas, who plays the love partner of the main character. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington deliver some vibrant performances. These two demonstrate amazing chemistry, the bond between their characters felt so strong and realistic. Over time, you learn to gradually care for these characters more and gain a strong feel of their emotions, and the script does an amazing job with this. It is no surprise that Tom Hanks landed his first Oscar for his performance. It is surprising however, that Washington didn't receive a nomination for this genuine performance. The story is very beautifully written and moves so well, while both managing its main plot line dealing with the court case and the subplot about Hanks's character forming a bond with his family when they learn about his terminal illness. There is no doubt that this very powerful, very moving, and does not fail to grab at your heart strings.Philadelphia is one of the best films with Tom Hanks as well as Denzel Washington.

Take whatever conventional wisdom you have about courtroom dramas and throw them out the window, because Demme wasn't interested in them here. It is above and beyond what it ever needed to be for it to work. It's an intimate portrait of so many things. A beloved American city, a man's desperate final journey for justice, a young swashbuckling lawyer's first high-stakes case, a misunderstood community of people and the elite powers that try to crush them. All interwoven to tell a classic American story as only Demme could tell it. For filmgoers who carefully examine cinematic technique, Philadelphia is an entire encyclopedia of the Jonathan Demme style of filmmaking. His style brings this film alive. Close-ups, whip-cuts, flashbacks, POVs as well as tricks with lighting and editing. Demme puts on a clinic in how traditional stories can be enhanced in a gratifying cinematic way. The Opera scene sticks in my mind as the most beautiful and haunting moments of the entire film. For just a few minutes, Andrew Beckett's love of opera sends him into bliss, and so does our film.

Knowing that he was fired because he has aids, Beckett hires Joe Miller to represent him, and gain justice.Hanks has been dazzling our screens for over 20 years now and his portrayal of an intelligent man who is suffering from aids has to be one of his finest to date. His role in Big was a challenge and a complete contrast to the type of character he plays in this 1993 drama, and come the end of the film, you will have really associated with Beckett, and will be close to weeping.Hanks is helped along by an equally impressive performance by Washington (Glory) as Beckett's lawyer, who has his own personal issues to deal with.The on screen pairing is excellent, and no other two actors could have created such a dramatic relationship and storyline, which was essential to drive the issue of homosexuality to the audience's attention.Set at a time of gay prejudice, Philadelphia grabs hold of the issue and shows audiences how sexual orientation affects everyone, your colleagues and your friends, and does so in a controversial fashion.The script is excellent, and the idea of homosexuality being difficult is driven by Hanks, and the effects of aids and being gay are very powerful and dramatic in the context of this film, making Philadelphia a very thought provoking drama.This film is a true testament to standing up for your beliefs and gaining justice for what you believe in and the context of the situation is exceptionally powerful.After seeing this film, I was shocked to believe that these issues ever took place in the work place, and other people had such thoughts about sexual orientation.Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning ""Streets of Philadelphia"" truly sets the tone for the film and will gear you up for one of the most controversial and thought provoking films of the 1990's.",Philadelphia

It's only three words but they leave an impact so great that nobody could possibly prepare for the consequences. These are the three words which define Philadelphia when Tom Hanks says them to Denzel Washington. The movie is about Andrew Beckett (Hanks), a homosexual man dying of AIDS, who feels he was fired from his job as a lawyer because of discrimination against him and his condition. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller, the attorney who takes Beckett's case. He makes it clear from the start that he does not like homosexuals, but he does love the law and will put aside his prejudices to uphold justice. It isn't a bad thing to say that the highlight of this film is the performances given by these two fine actors.Philadelphia is an emotionally moving story, and Hanks and Washington deliver tenfold in their conflicting roles. Watching their relationship mature throughout the film is a heart wrenching delight for the audience. Because of these two immaculate characters, who seem to be completely opposite but are actually very similar, the film serves as a fantastic emotional treat. The story is rich with moral debate that deals with human nature and our prejudices against those who are different. The law firm that Beckett is fired from claims that they fired him for his incompetence and inability to act accordingly and to the best of his ability. But Beckett firmly believes that it is a deep seated bigotry that got him fired when the managers of the firm found out he had the deadly AIDS virus. This film beautifully raises awareness against prejudice and discrimination and makes a wonderful social statement that needs to be heard. And it is all done by the excellent and believably heartfelt performances from Hanks and Washington.The acting and social statements are the driving force behind Philadelphia. Most other aspects take a relative backseat to the important message brought up in this film. The direction and cinematography of this film seems odd at times and for some reason the director has an obsession with close ups. Hanks and Washington drive the character development of this film and the supporting cast, albeit necessary, don't seem to have the same richness and prevalence as the two leads. I said this is an emotional film, and it is, despite there being a few scenes that seem forced and only established for the purpose of having emotion, almost giving the feeling of force fed emotion. All of these are minor complaints that do not undermined the true integrity of this fine film.Philadelphia is a beautiful film that will be relevant for a long time to come. It has a strong heart that emanates an important message about discrimination and human rights. A great watch, if only for the fantastic performances and the strong ideals.",Philadelphia
75,TOMASBBloodhound,Fine film doesn't seem as groundbreaking now.,8,4 March 2009,"Hollywood hadn't done much up to this point with mainstream gay characters and the subject of AIDS. And really there hasn't been all that much done since in terms of landmark cinema, save for maybe Brokeback Mountain and maybe a few others. Maybe it took some serious talent like Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington to drag the general public into see something like this. Now, over a decade later, it doesn't seem nearly as edgy. Is this because society is warming up to gay people, or is it because people have stopped caring as much about AIDS? Maybe both. There is no question that gays seem to be gaining more and more acceptance, but there is also no doubt that AIDS is still taking its toll on society. Though we are closer than ever to finding a cure, it is still taking many, many lives from us. But a cure will be had some day.The film deals with Tom Hanks as an apparently bright young lawyer who is battling AIDS. Early in the film he is given a promotion at his ultra-prestigious Philadelphia law firm, and also assigned a very important case. But no sooner does he get promoted, than one of the senior partners notices a probable Kaposi's sarcoma lesion on his forehead. Hanks begins getting sick and missing work, but he still seems to have the case under control. However, just before the statute of limitations runs out on the case, his work turns up missing. Of course they find it just in time, but the chaos is used as an excuse to fire Hanks. He obviously suspects he is being fired for having AIDS and plans to sue his old firm. Since they are so powerful, and probably due to his advancing symptoms and appearance, nobody but a low-rent ambulance chaser (Washington) will take his case. The rest of the film deals with the lawsuit, and Hanks's deteriorating condition and his relationships with his family and lover.The film works best when it deals with Hanks as a person. His Andy Beckett is an all-around great guy and you will really feel sorry for him. The part dealing with the trial is less convincing since it is so blatantly a case of discrimination that the firm should have just settled it out of court and tried to bury the whole thing. The senior partners are portrayed as basic curmudgeons who could not possibly win over a jury. Another misstep is with Washington's initial homophobia. Any man who really felt this way about gays (especially ones with AIDS) would have likely never taken Andy's case. And there is a really embarrassing scene where a gay man tries to pick Washington up in a drug store. The guy has a football jersey on and is carrying a ball while hitting on Washington. As if the film is screaming at the audience..""See, look! Gay men play football, too!"" Really? Never would have guessed that. Anyway, the film is powerful enough, and it is one of Jonathan Demme's better efforts. And Hanks deserved his Oscar.

Surprisingly it is quite poignant and lacking much of the cheese and careful presentation of new and potentially risky things that has made Hollywood famous. There are few stereotypes and even the ""corporate slime"" characters get a fair shake at being shown as merely human beings. They may not be the most likable, but still it shows them as people and, as we all know, people are far from perfect.However, the film's most interesting element would have to be Joe Miller. Hanks does give a great performance as a gay man in a difficult situation, but it is with Miller that most people will be able to directly relate. He is the guy initially unsympathetic to and even disgusted with homosexuals. There are several scenes which Miller has many internal and external revelations that are particularly strong.

Quite apart from the subject matter itself, the two principal actors, Tom Hanks (enjoyed his `Forrest Gump') and Denzel Washington (memorable performances in `Cry Freedom' and `The Pelican Brief'), were stupendous, well worth their Oscars (if how many of them are anything to go by to judge a film..........). I cannot help thinking that a third Oscar was justified: Jonathan Demme showed us once again that he has a maestro's hand for this kind of film, just as in `The Silence of The Lambs'. Nowhere is this better perceived than in the scene with Hanks and Washington while the former explains and translates an aria being sung by María Callas; and the ensuing few minutes when the latter arrives home to his wife and daughter. These 12-15 minutes must rank among the best pieces of North American cinematography of all time. Simply superb. My only snuffle is that it might have been a good idea to have used another soprano, like Joan Sutherland for example; everyone has a favourite soprano, I suppose: María Callas is not mine.Excellent film, well worth renting if you missed it: I give it 8 out of 10, a bit higher than the present IMDb voting average. I can't wait to see `Cast Away'...........",Philadelphia

85,braddugg,A significant film in the history of America and even the world over.,8,8 September 2014,"A significant film in the history of America and even the world over. It's an important film in terms of Gay rights and even the discrimination for the AIDS patients. Never before this movie was such a strong case was build up for the fight against discrimination of AIDS patient. Based on a true story, PHILADELPHIA is movie that is made well and made throughly engagingly and is completely empathizing the victim of discrimination and the victim of AIDS. Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett gave a great performance, with all the nuances touching the notes of perfection, and making me empathize with him. It;s not sympathy, people like him need, it's empathy. They don't tear drops they need people who stand by them. Denzel Washington as Joe Miller, fought his case and fought it hard to win not just compensation for Beckett, but also glory fro him and he made history with this. Kudos to Jonathan Demme, to have made it with a poise that deeply moving and at the same time having a reality check completely in place so that it is not dramatized out of proportion. It's a case that's well fought with an ardor and decency that we see in good cases fought between good people. Andrew Beckett was good but he was Gay, his partner is Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez. Antonio gave a subdued and a good performance. Indeed everyone played their part well, be it the kids of Joe Miller too. I liked the acting of everyone, but it was a Tom Hanks movie. Yet, I loved Denzel Washington's poise more than anyone else, in the film. Now, coming to the production, firstly kudos to the studios Tristar to have accepted a subject which in 1993 was still considered a taboo and bring out a brave film. Thanks Tristar for trusting in Jonathan Demme, a master in his own way who had to struggle a lot to establish himself as director.Now, the dialogs are good. The case was terrific I must say, mostly convincing arguments, it just goes to a peak when Miller asks Beckett to open his shirt. Rest all was great in a very very important trial and a historical case. A great movie that has a relevance of taking up a social issue and fighting it to the core. This is a for sure 4/5 from me.",Philadelphia
86,christophe92300,Necessary,5,11 November 2014,"This drama coldly and strikingly reminds us of how the disease was, in the early 90's, still very unknown to the public. The nature of the premise is inevitably appealing but unfortunately the script is very academic : statement of the facts, trial, verdict, done deal. Scenes follow each other very linearly, without much tension, and despite high stakes you never really get carried away by story whose mise-en-scène is sometimes too melodramatic. Hanks first major performance, though awarded an Academy Award, feels quite insipid, as is the whole cast in fact and the movie in general, necessary but far from being a top drama.",Philadelphia

That's right, so this movie is about discrimination, no doubt's there and every ""inspired by true events"" TV movie talks about this same theme. So, what, or let me rephrase that, who keeps this one from being standard fare? Demme. Springsteen. Callas. Denzel. And above all them a man which rises up to perfection as he lives with the character and makes us cry when he reaches his summit. A man which achieves a stature few manage to, a man which gets out of his body an inhabits another one like few can, and a performance to live in history. Since the beginning to the very end, Hanks is the depiction of the ordinary man who becomes extraordinary by the consequences of our acts and the acts of others. At the final moments we know Hanks wouldn't be the same no longer. He would be someone who rose to the top in only two hours of life.  And this is rare. Incredible film, which goes straight to our insides and, from within, makes us tremble. A hommage to millions of lives lost.",Philadelphia

91,patriciogl10,A moving story that deeply resonates within.,8,1 November 2019,"I can't begin to imagine the historical significance this film must have had in the early '90s, when AIDS was at is peak of its awareness, but I get a sense of it from watching Philadelphia and other related entries on the subject matter. To make this film stand out they needed powerhouses to carry and elevate this effort into a moving, compelling and poignant story of injustice, discrimination and intolerance. It is quite sad the notion one gets when sees Andy Beckett so desolate in his own battle, which paints a pretty bleak picture of what every homosexual suffering from AIDS must have gone through in those days. Tom Hanks is unbelievably good in his portrayal of a sick and hopeless man, played with the ease and seriousness the role demanded. Denzel Washington also provides a splendid performance as the determined lawyer willing to help Beckett stand against the law firm that discriminated him and left him without a job.The soundtrack feels crucial, it is so beautifully embedded to the film that it is like it cannot belong somewhere else, particularly Streets of Philadelphia by the Boss, Bruce Springsteen, which is a fantastic song. It reminded me of Berlin's Take My Breath Away in Top Gun; you hear the song, you remember the movie or either you watch the movie and remember the song. That's how powerful the film-soundtrack relationship is, and it proves how successful and unforgettable can a film be when you combine many appreciable elements that seamlessly flow together.This is Philadelphia, an inspiring feature that doesn't have any reasons to let you down. You'll be pleased with it.",Philadelphia

The film came at a good time; the 90s were a changing transitional period, where AIDS was on the rise, particularly to homosexual sufferers.However, this film is about so much more. Is about relationships, human bonds and emotions, brought brilliantly through the spectrum of Academy Award Winning director Jonathan Demme and the acting abilities of an outstanding cast, with Tom Hanks (who is mesmerising in his first Oscar Winning performance) and Denzel Washington providing a powerhouse, dynamic performance as the slightly unconventional lawyer who finally defends the character of Tom Hanks.""One of the top 5 films of 1993. 4 stars"" ""A powerful film"" 8/10",Philadelphia

94,fimimix,..if you had done a little research on AIDS..,10,4 June 2006,"....you may have had a different opinion of this movie, and you CERTAINLY would have written a different commentary.I was shocked to learn of AIDS, even though it was discovered right here in Los Angeles by Dr. Michael Gottlieb, via ""Patient O"". Believe me, the ""world-class"" LOS ANGELES TIMES could have played a much bigger role of notifying the world on this pandemic. There were so many ""causes"" to identify: when it was finally decided it was a virus, I was further shocked to discover how public officials were so unconcerned, that it would only infect gays. THAT made me think that the common cold is also a virus: does it infect only a certain segment of society? Get real !! Because I made my living for so many decades as an entertainer talking face-to-face with people, I talk a lot. I did just that, for about 15 years. I couldn't fathom that scientists could be so dumb, so I started from scratch - not knowing which way to turn - to expose those who were making ""take-it-for-granted"" statements.Some way or other, I got my foot in the door - you'd be surprised how many scientists and high-office politicians helped. I learned a lot, right quick. I went to public symposiums held by the doctor who discovered how a certain group of gay men were all infected by a single individual. I particularly remember a symposium I attended - in the then newly-created city of West Hollywood - for nurses and health-care providers. The main topic it was discussing was ""what do gay people do, sexually""? In the city of ""Boys Town"" and heavy hustling on most of its streets? You can be certain I shocked them all by stating ""the same things you and your sexual partners do, sexually, but aren't talking about it here"". I eventually gave-up - I was writing to scientists all over the world; I had contacts in CDC, WHO, Institut Pasteur (where the virus was originally discovered); Congress; state legislatures - I just had too much data to comprehend.....and knew that by the time I was ready to do the exposure, it would be years down the road, and too late. FINALLY, THE LOST ANGELES TIMES has printed an article about Dr. Tony Fauci at NIH that advises EVERYONE under 64 be tested - 250,000 Americans do not know they are infected. I know people who have been infected for 25 years......still healthy....I agree that ""Philadelphia"" came too late in the pandemic, also, but knew millions of people STILL are ignorant about it - denial ! I've read every comment. I am going to watch the film again tonight, although it is vivid in my mind. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar simply by having the courage - or being paid so much money - to do the role; not too much acting going-on, but effective. Can you believe that Banderas, today, isn't even listed in the cast of IMDb.com? I thought he was excellent in the film, as was Joanne Woodward playing the stalwart mother - the whole family was played so well. Those family-members who disown a member simply because he's gay need to see a shrink. How could ""Scubergmu"" definitely know that gays don't have supporting families ? On comments on Washington, many of them got his character right as being homophobic. However, they missed the point of the library scene - after hiding behind books and seeing Beckett being harassed by a librarian - ""did you find a lawyer?"" - ""I'm a lawyer"". He became hooked to take the case by the brilliant understanding Beckett had of the legal data. He didn't suddenly become friendly - he may have even determined this would be a big case and he wouldn't have to spend so much money on TV-ads. His character developed from that point, with the compassionate help of his wife. Washington was superb.Demme's direction was right-on. Is anyone so naive to not know that Hollywood is well-versed in homosexuality ?....after all their cover-ups ? No matter how late in the pandemic this film appeared, it's still a powerful story. That this group of people finally found the gumption to release it deserves whatever awards it earned. Someone wrote ""the party"" scene had no drag-queens: did you miss ""Mona Lisa"" ?I could write forever about this film, but feel everyone should get it and study it. One viewing can't give you an enlightened viewpoint. I give it 15-out-10 - so frightening this scourge is spreading, rather-than being defeated. Watch this movie with an open heart.",Philadelphia
95,ivanmessimilos,Great but not perfect movie,7,25 July 2021,"A very brave move was to make a film on this topic at the time. I even think that a film like this today would be completely different because times have changed in the meantime. Personally, I really like movies where the action takes place in the courtroom, so in this movie, such scenes are the best for me. The Hanks-Washington acting duo, as expected, carried the entire film. I liked that they were opposed, even though both lawyers are on the same side, Hanks is gay (and without clichés), and Washington is a black man who doesn't even like homosexuals, but accepts the case for personal fame and media attention. The rest of the cast was neither special nor important. However, I didn't like the rhythm in the film because it wasn't equable. Almost all the scenes outside the courtroom were not so interesting to me. I find the film a little too critically acclaimed so I wasn't impressed when it ended because it has its flaws. Of course, the introductory song is perfect.I have to mention how this film changed Tom Hanks 'career. He used to make good films, but those two were either comedies or romantic films (or even both). The Oscar was followed by films and roles that we can rank among the best in his category and he became one of the best living actors.",Philadelphia

In this film you get two amazing performances from both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. Indeed this movie displays acting at its best.Hanks portrays the hero of the film, Andrew Beckett, who is fired from his lawyer job due to the fact that he has aids. This is one of his best jobs as an actor ever. Many will say this is his best, I prefer his job in Cast Away and Forrest Gump, and they are not far off. He does a great job of playing a guy who has aids and still wants want is rightfully his.Denzel Washington for me was the star of the film. The fact that his character is homophobic and yet helps a gay man get justice in the end shows great acting. He does a great job portraying a homophob and a great lawyer at the same time.This review is short, but overall I think this is one of the best moview ever, definitely one of the best court films.

He insisted that he was not a homophobic and that is how this film emerged. Any film that a filmmaker uses to prove himself contrary to popular belief is bad because the filmmaker is using the film to his own justice. Despite this factor working against him, Demme provides a strong story with Hanks's best performance to date and Washington in great form as well. The acting is what pulls this contradicting act by Demme across and Demme mostly conceals his urgency to not be called a homophobic.",Philadelphia

His partner isn't very believable however, and their relationship isn't really explored.

100,frankwiener,City of Brotherly Love,9,31 January 2019,"For me, this is a film that actually improves with time. I'll never understand why a film should be penalized because it happens to portray life as it existed at the time it was made. While views of homosexuality and of the disease AIDS apparently have changed since the film was made over twenty five years ago, why should that make a difference to the quality of the film as a work of art? I was disappointed by the number of IMDb reviewers who lowered the film's rating only because they considered its subject ""dated"". We can and must learn from history. Today isn't everything, folks.The film's excellence is the product of its overall direction by Jonathan Demme (""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Something Wild""), an outstanding, carefully compiled musical score, superb photography by Tak Fujimoto (""Badlands"", ""Melvin and Howard"", ""Ferris Buehler's Day Off"", ""Silence of the Lambs""), and exceptional acting both by the leads and a very talented supporting cast.Fujimoto's unforgettable opening sequence that captures a city consisting of so many contrasting elements and different faces is one of the best film beginnings that I can remember. The lively beat of Bruce Springsteen's song ""Streets of Philadelphia"" provides the perfect accompaniment to the visuals. I also loved the later, aerial shot of the William Penn statue at the top of city hall as a dramatic reminder of the city's important role in our history as a nation that was founded on the principles of protecting the fundamental rights of its citizens.Demme selected the musical items very carefully and very prudently. Unlike other reviewers, I feel that the mournful sound of Maria Callas singing ""La Mamma Morta"" (""They Killed My Mother"") significantly contributes to the tragic atmosphere of a heart-wrenching story. Neil Young's stirring ""Philadelphia"" ends the film with the perfect sense of quiet, spiritual reflection. After such a tragic story, that is all that remains for us.Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks both deliver stellar performances, and I don't know why Washington was not recognized for his first-rate portrayal of Joe Miller, the homophobic ambulance chaser who suddenly realizes that Andy Beckett (Hanks) is a victim of the same discrimination that Miller might have experienced at some time in his life as an African American. The dramatic change in Miller is handled very adeptly by Washington. Although Mary Steenburgen's name, which appears far down the list of acting credits, can easily be overlooked, her powerful performance as the brutally cold leader of the legal firm's defense team cannot possibly be ignored, no matter how she personally loathed the part. Antonio Banderas and Jason Robards, among others, provide outstanding support as well.",Philadelphia

It's incredible how powerful human beings are and same goes for Joe that in first was repelled by Andy and after seeing how he is ready to fight for himself, he decided to help him. Nerves and will that Andy put into this case were humongous and he brings every little emotion to screen and puts quite a experience for everyone watching. It shows how people are treated as not equal and that there are so much judgment in a lot of humans. Some of the scene were a little choppy and maybe tried to be bring some feeling but didn't quiet succeeded. Magnificent and moving performance by Tom Hanks which just left mouths shut and projected so much emotions, pain and fight for right things. Denzel also puts up a great performance and shows how humans are great and willing to fight for another. Musical piece that played is also very refreshing and amazing. 3.5/4",Philadelphia

Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington carry this film with astonishing performances that are a trademark in both careers.A homosexual man with AIDS, (Tom Hanks) sues his law firm for unfairly firing him because of his condition, with the help of his homophobic and germaphobic lawyer, (Denzel Washington).It's corny, canny, and patriotic, exploring several themes of HIV discrimination, homophobia, and law corruption. It stays focused on its message, serving it proudly and strongly. As soon as the beginning starts up some Bruce Springsteen, you're immediately surrounded by the Philadelphia environment.Even though I like Tom Hanks's character in Forrest Gump more, I think this is the better performance, possibly in his whole career. He displays the process of sickness in the most gripping way possible that will make you not be able to stop watching. At the same time he's incredibly inspirational as a character who cries out for homosexual and AIDS support. Denzel Washington is super supportive. Very unlikable at the beginning, but learns to overcome his fear of gays and AIDS to understand the importance of friends and the friendly nature of people.All the scenes with Tom Hanks with his family and friends just make the ending all the more sad. I put the spoiler warning on here just in case, though most people should get that he dies in the end because it's AIDS. With that said, the ending is literally unmatched in how sad it is. It's not a struggle because you instantly lose as soon as that Neil Young song starts playing. Don't fight it, you will lose.This film doesn't try too hard to hammer in its message.

Denzel Washington is so good in this role specially the scene where Hanks get him to listen to his favorite opera. This scene is just stunning. Everyone of us has his/her own pains and this piece of music with Washington almost tearing, really gets your goose pumps. There are so many special moments in this movie other than the opera part. There is for instance, Denzel's famous line ""consider me a three years old kid"", the last court scenes and the over all goal of the movie which is to say that no body has the right to judge you, destroy your career even if you are dying, and most importantly consider himself a God above your sins no matter what were they and chooses to treat you like shiiiiit.

113,cstotlar-1,"Wonderful material, usual treatment",4,31 January 2011,"The premise to the film is extremely promising - a victim of AIDS fired from work - but the treatment is heavy-handed. It reminds me of an up-dated Frank Capra with the bad guys (rich and powerful) pitted against the good guys (poorer but Simon pure). The emphasis is for the underdog, quite transparently, and the villains of the piece are portrayed in two dimensions only, rather like Eisenstein's gargoyles. The constant reaction shots during the trial play on the emotions of the viewer and the episode with Callas opera aria is downright embarrassing to watch. As Shirly Booth put it in ""Sheba"". ""all but the bloodhounds yappin' at his rear end"". Where's Otto Preminger when we really need him? Curtis Stotlar",Philadelphia
114,DanB-4,Moving and poignant without being preachy,8,8 August 2001,"In 1993, not many films major films with top stars had taken on the AIDS as a topic, so Jonathan Demme really was taking a risk here. He made the smart move about keeping the movie true to the story and outlining how all of us are prejudice in one form or another. He also made a film about a man dying from AIDS, plain and simple.Philadelphia does not stand on a high horse as a gay rights film, and if it did its mass appeal may well be ruined. I am very conservative by nature, but still this film makes me cry and reminds me that above all, people die a horrible death.Hanks won a well deserved Oscar here, and I think he won mostly for the brief but pivotal scene where his lawyer (Denzel Washington) re-directs a line of questioning about skin lesions. I will not spoil for you, but if this scene fails to move you then nothing will.I love courtroom dramas and this a great one. Denzel Washington is key - you see his character change over time from a greedy lawyer with prejudices to a compassionate friend. I do not think that the his character ever overcomes his prejudice, but grapples with it and learns what is right in spite of himself. Denzel gives a Oscar worthy performance as well.A wonderful film.  ***1/2 out of ****",Philadelphia
115,fubared1,The most dishonest movie ever made about gays and Aids,3,19 July 2001,"This piece of Hollywood trash is totally worthless in terms of presenting any truth about gay life and dealing with AIDS.  Now I can see why a director like Spike Lee would object to Spielberg making 'Amistad'.  He just doesn't know or understand anything about the subject matter, and I doubt the director here knew much about gays or AIDS.  At least he didn't demonstrate to me that he had any more knowledge or empathy than Denzel Washington or his character did.  And as for Hanks playing a gay man, well, it was much like Jimmy Stewart in 'Rope'.  He had no idea what he was doing. Banderas, who has played a gay man in his films with Almodovar, at least seemed to have some idea.  All the other 'gay' men were simply the usual Hollywood stereotypes.",Philadelphia
116,kevin142,Love is important,8,21 September 2005,"The company fired suddenly AIDS patient Andrew. So Andrew decided to sue the company for discrimination. His previous adversary Joe became his defender. At first Joe was cautious to Andrew. With their frequent meeting, Joe learned more about Andrew. The most touching scene was that Andrew explained emotionally the meaning of lyrics to Joe when they were listening to Andrew's favorite opera. If you watched it, you could feel the power of love.Although the case was the main line, it also showed us the importance of love. So I would take it as an excellent family drama. It makes me feel that love is so important in our daily lives. After finished watching the movie, I will love my family more than before.Tom Hanks deserved fully his academy award (the best actor). No doubt he is one of the best actors in America. His good works are countless. Just name a few I liked most. Forrest Gump, Saving private Ryan, The terminal.Highly recommended. 8/10",Philadelphia
117,Derek237,A very important film,10,25 March 2003,"More than anything, Philadelphia is a story simply about people and the human nature. As the opening credits roll with Bruce Springsteen's ""Streets of Philadelphia"" playing, there are several shots of the camera going by many different people in the streets and inside buildings. They are doing different everyday different things like working or walking with friends. Then as the credits and song end, the attention and focus almost randomly stops at the story of two lawyers played by Hanks and Washington. They are rivals in a case, and seem like two complete opposites. Minutes later we learn that Tom Hanks has AIDs, and about 20 minutes later we learn he got fired from his job. He believes that he was fired only because his employers somehow found out he had it, and discriminated against him. He seeks the help of Denzel Washington, his last resort, and he eventually and hesitantly takes the case. By the end they actually become close friends. A lot closer than Washington's character would probably like to admit.Even though it's barely even 10 years old, Philadelphia seems a bit dated. It was made at the time when AIDS was increasing, and new things were being learned about it all the time. It used to be believed that only gays could get it, but now we know that's just not true. The employers that fired Hanks spout out clichéd lines that any prejudice person would. They seem like cardboard cut-outs. But none of that matters. It's not a political movie. Like Hanks says to a reporter in one scene, ""I'm not a political man. I just want justice to be done."" Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are great. Hanks obviously steals the show, but actually not by too much. It's a great performance and this is the movie that made me a Tom Hanks fan for sure.My rating: 10/10",Philadelphia

119,gottogorunning,Wonderful Moving Film!,7,9 August 2005,"I saw this movie when it first came out. As i grew up in the Philadelphia area ,it hit home quite well. The scenes ,the locations all incredible and moving . Tom Hanks portrayal was so moving, I cried. The opera scene may have seemed too long but think about it.In reality can you put a time frame on someones expressions . It was beautifully worked. Denzel Washington was good in this movie and the scene of him being come onto in the drug store was real . I know that scene and have been in it myself and it showed how most heterosexual people handle it by getting upset rather than saying excuse me I'm sorry I'm not gay . I mean if a woman hit on him and he wasn't interested would he yell at her. The family was depicted honestly , I know gay men who have wonderful loving families who overcame prejudice and loved their children no matter what . So you critics who say that the family was too good to be true ,take note, I'm sure that in real life a family like that it took years to get to what they portrayed in the movie. they loved their son no matter what. Jason Robards was wonderful as the opposing lawyer and I'm sure that this has happened a lot in real life before laws have become stricter on firing because of orientation.We all know how his character felt . betrayed , sickened ,like he had to go run out and get tested and take 1000 showers. And what a shocker to see sweet Mary Steenburgen type against cast as a ruthless defense lawyer . She is so a comedic actress that it was wonderful to see her stretch her acting skills. A few goofs not noted . Jason Robards mentions to his defense team to find out about gay bars that Hanks' character frequented on Chestnut St.At the time of filming there were no gay bars on Chestnut St. And also the gay porno theater where he had his anonymous encounter with another man is not in Philadelphia but rather I believe in LA.

All that courtroom crap was baloney. I couldn't stand it. I almost admired the few who had the balls to say they didn't like homosexuality, et al.

121,matlefebvre20,"This movie has AIDS, but it will never die",9,23 August 2006,"I'm gonna explain you my review like if you were six-year-old.OK, this is just a joke. It's just that in every movie, there's a quote that is more outstanding than others. In ""Philadelphia"", it appears that Joe Miller's favorite expression (although he alters ages sometimes) is the trademark.""Philadelphia"" stars two of the most impressive actors of today's cinema: Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. The movie is directed by Jonathan Demme, who previously gave us the multi-Oscar winning ""Silence of the Lambs"". Demme proves once again that he is one of the most skillful filmmakers of this generation and his profound humanity and powerful emotional moments give to ""Philadelphia"" a huge greatness.Even if it was made in 1993, ""Philadelphia"" still looks very revealing in 2006. Homosexuality still is a very present form of discriminatory in today's society, especially in North America. The movie is a powerfully realistic, if not shocking mirror of modern America, especially towards the homosexual question.The movie is about Andrew Beckett, a brilliant and opera-loving Philadelphia lawyer played by Tom Hanks, who is brutally fired from his law firm. His superiors invoke professional reasons, mainly the near-loss of an important file, but Beckett is certain that he was fired because of his homosexuality and because he contracted AIDS. Beckett wants to sue the firm and he wants Joe Miller (played by Denzel Washington) to represent him.At first, Miller refuses, because he is a homophobic. And 'phobic' is not an exaggerated term, because we quickly see a paranoid Miller who believes he could have been contracted AIDS simply because he shook Andrew's hand and he also tells her newborn daughter to never come across homosexuals.However, Miller puts his own prejudices behind and accepts to take on Beckett's case, also because he feels that the law has been violated. The movie then becomes a legal drama, where much of the action takes place inside the tribunal.The choice of Philadelphia as the city where the action takes place is not a coincidence. As explained by Miller, Philadelphia is ""the city of brotherly love, the birthplace of freedom"" and where the Declaration of Independence was signed, this document that says that ""all men are created equal"".To make ""Philadelphia"" such a great movie, director Demme used the most powerful weapon of all: emotion. Emotional moments are present during the whole two hours of the film and each actor, even the smallest one, delivers a solid performance.Hanks and Washington stand above the others and the chemistry between both of them is undeniable. Hanks' Oscar-winning interpretation of Andrew Beckett is almost unbelievable, due to his emotional personality, his physical transformation and the conviction he puts into his role. Washington is almost as remarkable. His sense of humor and irony has been largely noticed, but his transformation from a homophobic TV-advertising lawyer to an almost Martin Luther King-like figure of gay & lesbian rights is the strongest point of his performance.There also are some special scenes which must be highlighted. Beginning with the living room scene in Andrew's parents house. We can feel the interaction in the discussion between the family members. It's very heart-warming and executed with solid professionalism. The hospital scenes where a dying Andrew lies in a bed, barely conscious, and wearing a respiratory mask. And the final scenes in Andrew's apartment where the funeral party takes place and where multiple candles are meticulously placed.There are very special camera shots in this movie. The opening credits are shown over multiple ordinary events happening in Philadelphia. Notable shots include Miguel's filming inside the parents house with a camcorder, which makes it closer to the audience and more personal. There are also Andrew's blurred visions when his disease strikes him in the tribunal.Musical highlights include Bruce Springsteen's opening song ""Streets of Philadelphia"" and poignant scenes in Andrew's apartment where he is absorbed by the sounds of his favorite opera, Andrea Chenier from Giordano.""Philadelphia"" is a powerful opera, with very high notes and its lot of strong emotional moments. It is one of cinema's hidden masterpieces and its heavyweight message makes it an excellent ambassador of today's society and its views on the people who are 'different'.",Philadelphia
122,mrbluto,One of the Best Movies of all Time,8,19 June 2003,"First let me say I waited 8 years to see this movie because of the death of my brother from aids. Philadelphia is a very moving personal story, of a lawyer with aids who is wrongly fired from his firm, this is a true story and to this day the law firm still has not paid up for losing the case. Philadelphia is Tom Hanks best film by far and he well deserved the Oscar. A great cast a great story and a great director. 9 out of 10Now lets get to the knuckleheads. I read one review of Philadelphia saying gay people are a myth like aliens. What a moron. My brother was not a myth, he was a hardworking man who did not know his lover was cheating on him, he died 6 months after finding out he had aids. He and the millions of gay people around the world are not a myth.A couple of other reviewers said Philadelphia was propaganda, ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!!! The Reagan administration called it gay cancer first, then after 15 years they admitted it affected non-gay people also. The republicans still think if they ignore aids it will go away. That is not propaganda it is the truth. People staring at a sick man wondering if he has aids is nor propaganda it is the truth. Insurance companies denying gay men health insurance is not propaganda it is the truth. Some Americans can't accept other races how can we expect them to accept gay people.

123,jofitz27,A superb poignant drama,9,21 February 2005,"*This may contain a slight spoiler*Jonathan Demme steps into the director's chair here to direct a film targeting the social prejudice of aids and race. I heard many things about this film before I watched it, how sad it was, how good it was. And I'd have to agree with both. It really is a good film. Starting off with a superb introduction (Bruce Springsteins ""streets of Philadelphia"") we are entertained by a comic scene between Andy (the ever superb Tom Hanks) and Joe Miller who later fights for Andy's case (magnificently played by Denzel Washington). It really is a true and deep film, accurately portraying all the things society looks down on yet still does sub-consciously themselves. Particularly in a scene where he is fired, it really shows; prejudice is an unwanted part of society and natural reaction. Yet it is still there, deep beneath the surface. This film has everything. All in all, it is a poignant, scarily accurate drama that is powerfully spreading the word of peace and acceptance. It is only weighed down slightly by one ludicrous opera scene.Overall: 9 out of 10",Philadelphia

It also showed how people are prejudice and also discriminate. The story of the film also fascinated me. Every time I watch it, it always nearly makes me cry at the end of the film.Tom Hanks really does deserve his Oscar award and Densel Washington definitely deserves an award for best supporting actor.

126,philip-ct,Springsteen's song is the only thing worth anything in this cliched insult to gay men,1,23 October 2001,"In this wonderfully kleen-ex-ed, sanitised film for the 'masses', Demme, Washington, and Hanks have sold out. I still maintain that Tom Hanks' best role to date has been in Big; it is a travesty that he could have garnered a best actor award for this role. His acceptance speech at the Oscars was better acting (surpassed only by Gwyneth Paltrow for Shakespeare in Love).Denzel Washington, fiery and at his political best, in Lovefield does not convince as the initially-homophobic-man-becoming-agay's-best-friend.And Antonio Banderas ... well, convince me that you can have a relationship with a special person and not kiss. (Hang on, Demme sanitises the ugly for Hollywood mainstream.) This film is a masterpiece of cliches - it trivialises the important issues, sidestepping them and masterfully avoiding issues. We are left realising that the central character - the opera-loving, former porn-cinema-cruising Hanks - has contracted the virus through some sullied means and can relax. After all, the sub-text of Philadelphia is, 'Shame. It doesn't happen to us.'  Us - being the diehard heterosexual population.It is a film that offends deeply. If you want to see a good film about AIDS, try 'And the band play on.'  If you want to feel OK about gay men but not have to cope with more than a hug, this is a film for you. You can wipe the tears from your eyes and be happy you are not one of 'them'.On the whole, a divisive, limp-wristed, indefensible film. Make money from illness. Make money from the fags. Be queer friendly. Be oh so liberal. See Philadelphia. Watch the gay man love opera, see him touch his partner on the shoulder. Later see them dance. Be liberated. Be safe.

127,KillerLord,A Movie That Will Forever Change Your Perspective!,10,9 October 2008,"Tom Hanks is among the best actors in the history of cinema and his name always arises in a discussion among seasoned movie watchers when they discuss about the best actors ever. And when one is talking about Tom Hanks, the first two or three movies that one talks about will contain ""Philadelphia"" as one of them. This is truly one of the most influential movies I have ever seen in my years spent watching movies. The story is about a lawyer named Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) who is a gay and has contracted the HIV infection. He is eventually fired from the firm where he works because of this and the movie showcases his battle for justice.When the law firm comes to know about the truth that their top lawyer Andrew is a gay, often visits the gay clubs and in this process has acquired the HIV, they decide to find an alibi in order to ""clean"" their firm off Andrew. Andrew knows the bitter truth and wants to fight for his rights. And he finds a lawyer Joe Miller(Denzel Washington). One can say that essentially see the movie from the perspective of Joe Miller. He is homophobic and just like most of us, he thinks of them as inhuman people.He is motivated by the magnitude of the case to take it up. He finds himself studying Tom Hanks and his surroundings and then begins to understand that all his inhibitions about gays are so very false. He finds Andrew to be a human being just like any other with the same level of commitment, passion and sincerity. He is exposed to the world of gays and gradually begins to understand them. And as he does, so do we. The movie's biggest strength is change our perspective about gays. The movie transforms our perspective of them from that of seeing them as senseless and stupid to seeing them as human beings just different in certain aspects. We are also taught by this movie as to how this difference between them and us is ignorable.In the middle of the movie, we are show Andrew's lover played by Antonio Banderas. I found this part of the movie to be most beautiful. The bond of affection and love between Antonio and Tom is so wonderfully portrayed with perfect control. There are no hard scenes which could have destroyed the movie. Instead, there is the most difficult to showcase aspect called body language. It is all body language! The relationship between Andrew and his lover is understood from their body language and it teaches us that it is hardly different from the kind of love and affection we all share for each other. We are also shown their families and get a peep into their feelings and attitudes.There are some really powerful scenes in the movie. The scene where Andrew indulges in the opera, the scene where Andrew loses his consciousness in the courtroom. And the last scene really leaves you with tears filled in your eyes. This movie dares to move on tough grounds. And it does a wonderful job. This is a must watch for all people. A very powerful movie indeed!",Philadelphia
128,andrewburgereviews,It had to be done,8,23 October 2019,"Under the watchful gaze of the corporate/industrious Jonathan Demme, ""Philadelphia"" is a by-the-book, presentable, respectable and especially necessary courtroom drama. This was released during a time when AIDS was, understandably, a scary thought. So, Demme took no risks and got the idea through and through.Despite ""Philadelphia""'s formulaic approach, the film succeeds due to its powerful emotional punch, poignancy and top-notch screenwriting and acting. While these things are inevitable and obvious, they do work. Bruce Springsteen's soundtrack laid against the city noise make for simple but beautiful audio-visual experiences. Add to that great performances by Tom Hanks as the lead--Andrew Beckett, a big-time homosexual lawyer at the biggest law firm in Philadelphia and fired due to discrimination because he is infected with HIV AIDS and Denzel Washington as Joe Miller--a homophobic but professional and fair small time lawyer who advertises himself on commercial breaks--the ""TV guy"".With these two, you can immediately see the formula. And while it works strictly in its boundaries, it does so in a hard way. Miller, despite admitting several times his homophobia, he is truly just and puts the law above anything else. He is reluctant to take Andy's case but soon he accepts. You cannot help but think that being an African-American he must've been victim of another type of discrimination himself. And indeed, he is, although really brief. There is a scene in which a library guard takes a long hard look at Miller as he passes by. The scene, while short, is long for what it contains but it gets the point across.And so does this entire film. No accident is been set in Philadelphia, the city where, essentially, American principles were born. The film throws PC messages all around but that is exactly what it needs to do. It does not act as a sermon--it simply enforces the already existing American Constitution. Not as much of a lesson as much as it is a reminder of normality. The movie's notion of normality also seems very impartial--anything which is not directly of intentionally hazardous to humanity is normal. This contains homosexuality which is fair but also aims to pass the spread of AIDS as simply an accident--which, actually, it is! I love its boldness and its openness in facing fears.Because, beyond hatred, it is fear that causes discrimination here. You can almost understand the corporate big-shots ruining Andy. They didn't discriminate against him as much as they were trying to protect themselves from an admittedly deadly disease. But while Hanks might convey the propaganda, it is Washington who Demme puts most of his weight on. He feels like a safe place for the audience, he is a family man with a newborn daughter and, most importantly, he is fair. ""These people make me sick... but a law's been broken""--this line sums him up. I appreciated him even more knowing he did not let his professional stance become tainted by any personal beliefs. It is yet another concept in this movie which I feel is overlooked by many. Seeing him struggle with his morality really gave me the feels--I almost forgot he is not the victim here.Despite its occasional melodrama, ""Philadelphia"" is a very good movie. One which we should be thankful for. Not only because of its contribution to modern progress, but also for its humanity represented so purely by Beckett's family and Miller's exemplary and inviting personality. Sure, everything here is self-righteous but it had to be--this had to be done.",Philadelphia

I really enjoyed watching this movie because it made you laugh and cry and very few movies do that. Tom Hanks is the only actor to win two consecutive ""Best Actor"" awards (Philadelphia and Forrest Gump) and I think Philadelphia was the start of his superior career in acting.

And who comes to the rescue? the black guy. Puhleeese. The gay party scene was pretty sickening. And by the way, why doesn't Hanks' ""partner"" have the virus? I noticed that the GLAAD people have posted like crazy that this is the best film since ""Citizen Kane."" I also noticed all the usual Hollywood lefties (or should I say ""fellow travelers""?) particpated in this film: Joanne Woodward, Tom Hanks, Mary Steenburgen, Bruce Springsteen. I guess Ed Asner, Mike Farrell and Jane Fonda weren't available. Demme should stop the politics and get back to entertaining people. As the L.B.

133,Supachewy,A Great Film About A Heartbreaking Story,8,26 August 2010,"The courtroom drama Philadelphia is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, and Antonio Banderas. The film takes place in modern day Philadelphia.The film starts off with Andrew Beckett (Hanks) and Joe Miller (Washington) working together in some sort of law meeting, they do not know each other before this and are for some reason in a meeting together. Beckett works for a big law firm and is promoted to become a senior partner, but at the meeting where he is congratulated one of the partners of the law firm notices a mark on his forehead. The film then cuts to I believe a month later where it is revealed that Beckett has been fired and is requesting Miller, a fellow lawyer, to help him sue the law firm that he worked at because he believed that he was fired due to the fact that he was a homosexual and had AIDS. Miller says that Beckett does not have a case due to the fact that he does not have enough information to make that conclusion. After some time it shows how Miller has a daughter and then the two men are at the public library. Miller at first hides from Beckett but then sympathizes for him because a librarian is asking him to go to the private section due to his illness. That is when Miller offers his services to Beckett and the highly emotional film starts to get the wheels turning.The screenplay for this film was highly moving. The characters had much depth to them and I understood how each the leads were feeling. I could feel how Beckett was not only suffering from his terrible illness, but from the people around him who thought he was disgusting and unnatural. Yet I also understood the reasons to why Miller disliked homosexuals and his reasoning for that dislike, but I respected him greatly for putting his personal beliefs to the side and doing what the law says to be correct. The film has some great comedic moments along with its memorable emotional moments. The only problem was that it was somewhat predictable, but that really did not make the journey the film brought me on less enjoyable.The direction by Jonathan Demme was very good for this film. The shots in general were really nothing special, but they got the job done, he succeeded greatly in bringing so much emotion into this film. He has proved that he can get amazing performances out of his actors and has gotten three of the actors he had worked with Oscars. It was not as well directed as The Silence of the Lambs, but still with these two back to back great films one would think he would have a much more successful career.The acting in this film was phenomenal. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar he received for his performance as Andrew Beckett and this performance is one of the many reasons why he is considered one of the greatest actors. He was just a purely lovable character and I felt so deeply for him. Bravo, Mr. Hanks, too bad you haven't acted this well since Cast Away. Denzel Washington was absolutely fantastic as Joe Miller. He is the most relatable character and was great in every aspect. His performance not getting nominated for an Oscar is another of the greatest snubs in history, yet I do not feel as bad for him since he did end up earning two Oscars so far in his career. Antonio Banderas has a minor role of playing Andrew Beckett's partner and plays it to the best the role can be played. Wonderful performances all around.The score for this film was as well brilliant. It added all the emotion whether it be light hearted or heart breaking. The song by Bruce Springsteen won an Oscar as it should have and the whole into score is exactly how such an emotional picture should be done.Overall I give this film a strong 8/10 because it is very good in every aspect. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas or films that are about social problems that are faced in the world.",Philadelphia

It has one of the most important subjects you can discuss, and I really think the movie really maid a point, that most people still can't get.The performances from Denzel Washington and Antonio Banderas was nothing special, but I expected a little bit more from Washington, being that he'd won an Oscar, that by the way I didn't think he deserved. But this is a great film with a great actor and a great subject. And it has one of the most greatest scenes I've ever seen.Thumbs up for Tom Hanks and one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks.",Philadelphia
135,Netscape_Navigator,yet ANOTHER overrated film,4,17 July 2005,"This movie had the potential to tell a compelling story, but they did it all wrong.The movie had good believable acting from Hanks and Denzel Washington, but they completely failed in the way they chose to tell the story. There's just too many courtroom scenes and not enough character development, and that gets very boring and repetitive, very fast. You can't give the movie credit for the story it's TRYING to tell, because as far as I'm concerned, the story it DID tell was not told in an entertaining way, this should've been more character driven.The two main characters weren't developed enough. For one, the transformation of Denzel's feelings about gay people was not believable, there just wasn't enough shown on screen to make the viewer believe that he would have any reason to change his feelings. The way it was directed, it looked as if that opera scene is what changed Denzel's feelings about Hanks, and that's ridiculous to have someone's lifelong feelings that has been etched into their persona be changed almost because of a single incident (like I said, the way it was directed implied this). They should've shown a gradual change and made it interesting, maybe throw in a scene where Denzel protects Hanks from ridicule or something, I don't know, just show some sort of growing relationship to make the viewer care.",Philadelphia
136,compi24,"Review of ""Philadelphia""",10,12 July 2011,"""Philadelphia"" is the story of Andrew Beckett (Hanks), a promising young lawyer at an upscale law firm. When the homosexual Beckett suddenly contracts AIDS he is fired unfairly fired from his workplace. Beckett then seeks the help of a small time homophobic lawyer, Joe Miller (Washington), to establish a wrongful dismissal case. Now from initial premise and the fact that I had heard Tom Hanks earned a Best Actor Oscar for his performance, I was expecting a fairly memorable movie. And I got one. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best and most moving performances with his portrayal of Beckett. Probably one of the most dynamic roles I've ever seen Hanks take on. He starts out as such a vibrant young man, yet as the film progresses, Beckett's illness does as well. Consequently, the audience witnesses the decline of a seemingly healthy man to a man who's body has been ravaged by an incurable disease. It's really quite heartbreaking. Tom Hanks worked well for this Oscar. Along side Hanks is Washington, who also gives a fine performance as the conflicted lawyer Miller. Like Beckett, Miller goes through a significant change as well - only his soul changes, not his health. It's really quite interesting to see Washington and Hanks work together on screen, as I've never seen it happen in any other film. The film also features a very well written script and a very nice direction from Jonathon Demme. The ending of this film is really quite something, and. . .yeah, I'll say it - the conclusion of this film was really intense for me to watch. Pretty emotional stuff. Overall I felt that ""Philadelphia"" is a poignant tale that succeeds in addressing many issues that have often been neglected in our time. I felt that it was filled to the brim with fine performances and palpable pathos. It's a great movie that I won't soon forget. Awesome.",Philadelphia
137,Colonel Ted,`Politically correct to a fault',6,19 February 2000,"I can scarcely believe it myself, but for once I entirely agree with something that Leonard Maltin has written. Indeed it was perhaps sadly inevitable that Hollywood's first film about AIDS would be an exercise in the politically correct that constantly watched its back. That is not to say that Philadelphia is a bad film. In fact is quite a good one. Director Demme should be credited for crafting an interesting and entertaining film that at least doesn't fall into the trap of being patronising to the point of insulting. Hanks is brilliant as the lawyer who is fired by his firm for having AIDS. In his first role after spending his career making comedies, he gives his `every man' routine its first outing, a style that he has been feeding off ever since with Apollo 13 to Saving Private Ryan. Washington too is great as the lawyer who loathes homosexuals, but worships fair play and eventually takes on his case. However the film stumbles over the script, which prevents its from reaching the great heights of profundity which it clearly aspires too. The characters are pretty much all caricatures. Hanks as the innocent, almost saintly gay lawyer out for simple justice from his evil heterosexual superiors (`He brought AIDS into our bathrooms!') while Washington as the nice black lawyer attempting to put the World to rights. We simply don't know anything about Hank's background, his family and lover Banderas are too good to be true and the fact that the audience even sympathises with him is testament to the dignity of Hanks' performance. The film works well given its limitations of the standard Hollywood courtroom drama. But 7 years on, the time is right for a more realistic and gritty portrayal of the issues at hand. 6/10",Philadelphia

139,arichmondfwc,Carefully Inspiring,6,24 January 2005,"There is a moment in the film in which I looked into his character's eyes and believed that Tom Hanks was actually gay. The commitment in his performance is monumental. The film is an episode of ""The Practice"" and not necessarily one of the best but if I feel inordinately happy I put ""Philadelphia"" on. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes. I loved Hanks in the part because I believed him so completely. The casting of Joanne Woodward is a stroke of genius. What an extraordinary actress. Her much to brief but perfect, moving, beautiful portrayal adds layers and layers to Hanks's character. We complete our understanding of him because of her. Denzel Washington is great fun to watch and as good as he is I haven't yet warmed up to him. There is something there that confuses me. Convincing in ""Training Day"" Unconvincing in ""The Preacher's Wife"" Banderas is lovely even if it was difficult to imagine him in a ""Law of Desire"" scene with Tom Hanks. I'm sure that a bit more explicitness about their relationship could have lifted this good movie into a great one, but probably wouldn't have made as much money. I'm not sure if I made myself clear, I'm recommending the film. I am, the qualms are all mine. Pay no attention. Hanks at his phenomenal best, Joanne Woodward and Bruce Springsteen. Of course I recommend it.",Philadelphia
140,garage5inc,"Sad story with a deeper meaning, a must see.",10,29 December 2002,"Philadelphia is one of the first original screenplays to show us the effects of AIDS on people's lives. It strikes them first with the fact that their life will be significantly cut short, it alienates them from people and can make them an outcast, it slowly eats away at the person's body, and tragically kills them.Tom Hanks's Andrew Beckett is a lawyer who is gay, and contracted AIDS. His law firm, like most people at the early 90's are terribly afraid and phobic of AIDS and just want it out, they feel they have been diseased just because Andrew was around them, talked with him, and touched things. Tom Hanks convincingly plays the role, as he beat out Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis for the 93' Best Actor Oscar. As Andrew's condition gets worse threw the movie it just becomes more sad and pathetic. Denzel Washington has a great role as Andrew's lawyer. Philadelphia is a very important movie to watch, heart-breaking story, real life characters, and looking at society's predjudice against people with AIDS. 10/10 without a doubt for this movie.",Philadelphia
141,seeingbystarlight,A Wrongful Termination.,10,30 July 2018,"The more I watch movies that I've only seen once, or not for a long time, the more I'm of the opinion that (for the most part) you can't possibly get a good idea about a movie just by seeing it the one time.My opinion of Philadelphia has changed drastically since the first time I saw it several years ago.The first time I saw it, I liked neither the story, nor the screenplay, and the movie's only redeeming quality (other than the cast), was the theme song which won an Academy Award.Now, however, after seeing it two weeks ago, I'm amazed at what a really great movie this is.The issues it touches on are explosive, and controversial.I never really appreciated what a good job it does of bringing them out, the script having been written objectively, and with a great deal of class, and finesse.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is one of the best attorneys at the top Philadelphia law firm that employs him.His bosses, in fact, have so much faith in his abilities, that they are about to let him represent the most prestigious client ever to come their way...until one of them sees something on Andrew's forehead which gives away his contraction of AIDS.Suddenly Andrew is fired, after the staged misplacement of a document allows the partners to claim he's incompetent.The excuse is as flimsy as paper, and Andrew (unable to put this outrage behind him) is determined to sue.No lawyer he goes to, however, can see that he has a case, and after his ninth try, Andrew finally finds himself in the office of Joe Miller (Denzel Washington).In the past, Joe and Andrew had been rivals in court, and like other attorneys, Joe does not see that Andrew has a case.He is also putt off by Andrew's sexual orientation, and, more importantly, his illness which makes Joe worry about his newborn baby.But after encountering Andrew in a library, Joe decides to represent him.The two men form a reluctant friendship, as the case drags on, and Andrew's life begins to slip away.All the cast was excellent, Denzel Washington was great, and Tom Hanks, (I must say), really deserved the Oscar. No one could've played the character as well as he did.This is a surprising, outstanding movie, which may warrant a second or even third watching to be appreciated, but it's certainly worth it.Originally, Review #118Posted On:

143,Seersha1,Recommended,7,8 June 2010,"Looking back, this film seems a bit ahead of it's time. At the time when this film came out, it was probably considered quite a brave role for Tom Hanks to take on, or Denzel Washington for that matter. They both shine with amazing performances in this important and wonderful film. It follows a gay man who is dying from AIDS in a court case against his former employees for wrongful dismissal, illustrating the injustice and inequality that people who are gay or people with AIDs have to face. Tom Hanks is truly fantastic, it's no wonder he won an Oscar for this performance. I highly recommend this film to others, and it an important one as a stepping stone to other films and even today there is still a stigma around being gay in Hollywood.",Philadelphia
144,LivBrumei,A great movie about a reality..it could be anyone with a different problem but the same story,10,26 January 2014,"Where to begin? For me the most beautiful thing about cinema is the power to insert us in a reality that may have little or nothing to do with ours. If a movie succeeds on doing this, (with of course a touch of fiction that makes reality more, let's say intense and interesting to watch)than it's a great movie to me. I had heard of Philadelphia several times and what it was about, but I never seek to watch the movie. It just didn't click. But the other day it passed on TV and I decided to watch. It turned out to be a great decision! Happilly I never met or knew of anyone with HIV around me (thank God!), but as a young pharmacy student I've a small idea what it means. A small idea because no one that doesn't walk on this people shoes can really understand them. Despite that, Philadelphia led me through a reality of someone living with HIV and the reality of people around him. The story it's amazing and it's told very well. Tom Hanks performance it's just amazing. I don't think I've seen him doing something like this in the last few years, so it sort of explains where he stands now. Overall every performance, soundtrack and scenes put you in middle of this reality: disease,fear of the unknown, challenges, discrimination, above all this comprehension,friendship and love. This movie brought me into this reality, got me thinking and made me feel sorry and at the same time happy for Hank's character. Overall thoughts: It's nice to see that in the 90's some people we're already mind opened, but how much have we evolved since then? As I see it, not much. We know much more about HIV, but the fear it's still present. Concerning the movie, it's not about gay people, it's not about HIV people, it's about everyone who has something different in them and are put aside ""gently"" and discretely to avoid issues. How many of us wouldn't like to have an hero available to go against this? I certainly recommend it!",Philadelphia

This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across.

Tom Hanks' brilliant performance rightfully one an Oscar for best actor in a leading role, along with Bruce Springsteen winning an Oscar for the song Streets of Philadelphia. The excellent performances from Denzel Washington and Antonio Banderes give it a great feel; and the direction from Jonathan Demme makes you feel as if your on the set.

I didn't particularly enjoy the pacing of the film, especially leading up to the court battle, which in itself didn't deliver the gasps and tension typically expected of a courtroom drama. Tom Hanks is incredible throughout however and worthy of the Academy Award for best actor, although I maintain his career best performance is saved for Forrest Gump.Denzel Washington also plays his part magnificently well as Joe Miller, a conflicted father and lawyer who is institutionalised by a homophobic, AIDS fearing culture. His transformation of character gives the story greater depth, although after initially being appalled by the idea, his motives for taking on Andy's (Hanks) case are unclear and mar his compelling arc.Overall the soundtrack and class acting make Philadelphia worth a watch, but when it comes to courtroom dramas I've certainly seen better.",Philadelphia

This was actually one of Tom Hanks worst acting skills put on display in my personal opinion. From such a topic, I expected a tear to fall at some point and well, that just did not happen. Maybe it's the age of the film when acting was quite different than it is today.

163,scubergmu,"Compelling, but over the top",8,22 April 2005,"To me this movie is both a relevant and compelling story, as well as a model of overcompensation. I feel as though Philadelphia was trying desperately to show a touching, human side to the AIDS epidemic, but at the same time overly conscious of the lack of compassion much of middle America has for homosexual victims of AIDS. As a result, our protagonist Andrew Beckett is made to be a virtual superman. I would have had more respect for the film if they'd made him more like you and me. If he had been a bright, successful lawyer with friends, a loving family, and a serious relationship that would have made him someone we could really relate to. Instead, Andrew was a legal phenom, THE rising star, future senior partner, the future leader of the law firm. And in his personal life, he was the most popular person at his firm, beloved by all. More than that, he was the most popular member of his whole family, he was brilliant, affable, going straight to the top, simply AMAZING!!! Doesn't it seem like they tried too hard to get us on his side? To show the human story of AIDS, show us an actual person, not superman. That is problem with Philadelphia.Having said that, Tom Hanks was fantastic, as usual. Denzel was also rock solid, his character basically representing all of us, the general public, the ones who don't empathize with gays because they either don't know any, or aren't conscious they know any, and fail to appreciate that they are real people and not merely stereotypes. His enlightenment with regards to this is one aspect of the movie I felt they came through on exceptionally. Philadelphia was an important story to be told, for just like so many other human tragedies, for us the unaffected to be able to see just one example up close and personal, it carries so much more weight than all the news reports and statistics in the world. I hope it had some positive impact in creating compassion among the general public. I just wish the film makers hadn't felt it would be necessary to go to superhuman lengths to give us a character we could feel for.",Philadelphia

Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends.  I could not buy any of these characters as real life people.   They were all caricatures.
The movie was totally predictable.  A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers.  Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case.  Guess who wins.  Guess who dies.  Guess who is sad about the death.
The pacing was very slow.  The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long.

Tom Hanks excelled even himself with his performance as an AIDS striken homosexual who is fired from his job simply because of his condition. It is Hanks, by himself, who makes the whole scenario in the film believable. Although this is Hanks's best performance of his career, he is very closely followed by Denzel Washington who gives a perfect performance as the only lawyer who will take on the case although he is a homophobe himself. The emotional strain of the film on the audience is immense and in the later stages of the film it is almost impossible to watch because of that. The make-up which gives the impression that Hanks really does have the terrible disease is perfect and the simple yet striking direction from Jonathan Demme(The Silence Of The Lambs) make this utterly compelling viewing although at times it is very uncomfortable.

166,emms75,Good bits and bad bits! (spoiler!!!),8,9 June 2004,"I saw this film for the first time last night on DVD. It's always been one of those films I felt I should watch, but somehow never got round to it. I've always been a fan of Tom Hanks, and was curious to see his performance in this particular role, being quite different to anything else I've seen him do. I was not disappointed by his performance, nor by that of Denzel Washington. I thought that both performances were very convincing. The movie overall, I felt was very good. It had a good story, and I cared about what the outcome of the trial would be. My only critisism was that I would have liked to have had more sympathy for Andrew Beckett. I did have a little weep at the end when he died, however I did have the entire film to prepare for that eventualitly as somehow I knew he was going to die at the end. The lack of sympathy I'm talking about comes from not having the chance to get to know the character properly, and not knowing enough about him to relate to him personally. I felt the film was rushed really, that there were large chunks of story missing. I'm not sure I liked the swift changes between events earlier on in the film where we are only really given facts about the character which are relevant to the trial later on. I suppose this may have been deliberate, as this would be similar to how facts are presented to a Jury in a courtroom. Before I saw the film, I knew that it was about a man with AIDS. I therefore thought it would either be depressing, or upliftiing. It turned out to be both. Generally a very good film that I would probably watch again.",Philadelphia
167,jsataluri,A movie that will never be forgotten.,10,23 February 2006,"When I watched this movie, I expected just the normal routine: guy getting fired because he's gay and has AIDS and he hires a lawyer to fight his cause and they win. But Philadelphia was more than that. It is a movie that makes us aware that gay people/people stricken with AIDS, HIV or any life-threatening disease are created equal as well. We are so frightened of gay people or people with AIDS that we alienate these people completely ignorant of the fact that they are part of the ""all men created equal"".Before Philadelphia was made, Tom Hanks was just a comedic actor. He appeared on sitcoms and SNL and performed in comedies like ""Bachelor Party"", ""Splash"", ""Big"". But all he wanted to do was to become a dramatic actor. Then this movie came and Hanks really pulled off the greatest performance of his life winning an well deserved Oscar. In the movie, Hanks portrays Andrew Beckett, a gay lawyer stricken with AIDS who is fired by his bosses. Sick and furious, he hires Joe Miller, a homophobic lawyer played by Denzel Washington to fight for his cause. But throughout the movie, audiences can see the pain and suffering Andrew Beckett is going through. In Joe Miller's office, when Miller says that he can't take the case, you can see the hurt in Beckett's face. During the courtroom scenes (particularly these scenes top A Few Good Men by a lot), Beckett is still in pain because of the sickness and angry. He looks at his bosses in loathing and Miller as hope. But the opera scene after the party is the real scene stealer as Beckett recalls his favorite opera. Audiences see the joy in his face that he had before he was fired. It didn't matter that he was gay, he was ecstatic, his life was fulfilled, HE HAD EVERYTHING. Upon his death scene, he is very happy to have won the case and passes away in peace.As mentioned before, Tom Hanks was never taken seriously until this movie and he gives his greatest performance ever, even better than Forrest Gump. This was his first dramatic performance and he really pulled it off, winning a well-deserved Oscar. Denzel Washington has always been a great actor and he does a superb job as the lawyer who sheds his homophobia to defend his client who in his eyes is as equal as all men. Probably Washington's best scene is when he grabs the young black guy who doubts he can succeed in the case and exclaims, ""I don't give a damn about what you think about me, I am a lawyer and I am going to win this case!"" His determination and commitment for Beckett's case are the most vital aspects of this film. These two titans of Hollywood are the best dramatic duo ever. Their chemistry is so well done that they are indeed the best actors ever in Hollywood. Also supporting them are Jason Robards as his boss, Mary Steensburgen as the opposing lawyer who gives a great villainous performance, Joanne Woodward as Tom Hanks's mother, and Antonio Banderas as Tom Hanks's gay partner.Director Jonathan Demme, coming off of a huge success in The Silence of the Lambs, does even more in Philadelphia. He does not try to show a true biopic, rather he is showing the portrait of a everyday man who happens to be gay and to have AIDS. The courtroom scenes are shot so beautifully that as mentioned, they surpass Kramer Vs. Kramer, A Few Good Men and many more courtroom dramas. Overall, this film is the best human told story ever. This is a great film which inspires everyone to take action against any prejudice. I applaud this film as a landmark to discovering that we must take action against discrimination and homophobia. Even those who are homophobic should realize the fact that everyone is created equal. We must not judge anybody by their skin, sex, diseases and homosexuality for that is wrong and unjust. This movie doesn't deserve a 10 out of 10. It deserves a 12 out of 10! A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!",Philadelphia
168,tenebrisis,Excellent interpretation,8,17 September 2017,"Hailed as one of the first big-budget films to address the AIDS virus, 'Philadelphia' relies on its top-notch cast to chart a course through difficult themes. At the emotional core, rather than a focus on the spectacular details of the disease, the film chooses to examine the discrimination and homophobic in-tolerances that those afflicted face. The real tragedy? The social demise and stigma of the individual which precedes physical death itself.Using the courtroom setting to stage its drama, 'Philadelphia', asks some difficult questions, but then in a puzzling reversal, it discards some of its more emotional elements and decides to play it safe. Some might argue that this quiet restraint is one of the film's strengths, but this seriously derails some of the film's emotive power.There is one scene in particular that drastically alters the tone of the film. Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, interprets his favorite opera to attorney Joe Miller, a self-proclaimed homophobia. The film seems to warp at the very seams as Andrew dramatizes the opera. It's an incredibly powerful moment and a sobering vision of what could have been.Nonetheless, the film accomplishes an imperative objective. Educating the masses and altering public perception and for this reason alone, 'Philadelphia' warrants celebration.",Philadelphia
169,SinaAwdijan,The saddest and one of the most brilliant movies,10,3 September 2019,"A movie for tough people because the topic is very serious. It made me cry so much and the actors did a great job playing so authentic, especially Tom Hanks who won his first Oscar for his role in this movie. The soundtrack underlined the tone of the movie perfectly. This movie is worth writing a review about it without a doubt. Philadelphia is a must- see!",Philadelphia
170,teacherlogan,Philadephia. A Necessary Film About Difficult Subjects,10,8 February 2008,"If Philadelphia were only a legal drama, it would be magnificent. It is more than that. It is a commentary of how the negative perceptions of homosexuality and AIDS permeated society. Some perceptions still do. These taboo subjects are seen as off limits in some circles. But all issues are worthy of serious discussion, however uncomfortable they may be. Under the veil disguise of a courtroom drama, Philadelphia makes that possible.Andrew Beckett is a talented young attorney at a prestigious Philadelphia law office. By his own account, he is an ""exceptional lawyer"" who has quickly risen up the ladder at his firm. Beckett is also a homosexual suffering from AIDS; details of his personal life he has kept from his employers. When Beckett is suddenly fired from his job, he attempts to bring a wrongful termination suit. After an exhausted search for willing counsel, he is finally represented by Joe Miller. Miller is an ambulance chasing personal injury attorney leery of taking on a homosexual client with AIDS.Jonathan Demme is one of those remarkable directors who is never locked into one specific genre. He has the comic credit of Married to the Mob, the psychological thriller Silence of the Lambs and the compelling social drama Philadelphia. Most directors find a niche and stick with it. Demme refuses to do so. Such daring film choice should be commended.What all his films have in common is strong characters, talented actors and compelling scenes to exhibit their talents. Demme sets the scene, puts his actors in position and allows their gifts to be displayed for the world to see. The results are breathtaking. The scenes between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs carried the film. Philadelphia had similar moments. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are two of the most talented actors in film, as their recognition by The Academy would indicate. Both were given opportunity to shine in Philadelphia. The courtroom provided Washington the stage to make his case against fear, hatred and discrimination of those 'different' from us. In the Courtroom it may be called grandstanding. In Philadelphia, Washingtons's scenes are powerful and resonate with the audience; the ultimate jury.With the multitude of outstanding dramatic roles now in his repertoire, one must remember that Philadelphia was one of Tom Hanks first dramatic performances. This, combined with the intense subject matter, made it an ambitious undertaking. Hanks is tremendous. Hanks' emotional performance in Beckett's apartment, with the Aria playing, is one of the great moments of the film and likely cemented his place as a sensational dramatic actor. The music, lighting and camera work only added to the power of the moment.Music was another key player in this film. Rock legends Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young open and close the film respectively with tender melodies that act as bookends for this powerful film. The Young song Philadephia together with the touching home movies, close out the film as emotionally as any in recent memory.At the heart of Philadelphia is the issue of discrimination. At one point in the film Joe Miller has to remind a colleague, despite what they both may think of homosexuality, ""a law's been broken here...you do remember the law?"". While Beckett's suit balloons into a landmark case, that is not his intention. He only wants ""what is fair and what is right"". You do not need to be a gay rights activist to support this notion of universal freedom from discrimination.Ultimately, Philadelphia brings the issues of homosexuality and AIDS discrimination to the forefront of conscience thought. It was the first studio picture to tackle these subjects. Beckett is a successful attorney with a loving partner. He has the support of family and friends. These are wonderful qualities, whatever your sexual orientation. Philadelphia reminds us that, at our core, we all have the same wants and needs. To deny us this is unacceptable. Philadelphia proudly takes up this charge and, in the process, gives us the pleasure of a truly outstanding film.",Philadelphia
171,gashmanflirty,Average Movie,4,16 May 2011,"The movie tried to be emotional, but it failed completely. This is because we were supposed to have sympathy for a man who contracted Aids by having gay sex inside a movie theatre with a STRANGER- not even his gay partner Miguel ( Antonia Banderes) It was a surprise to see him in this movie. I don't' think so ! I had no sympathy at all. The movie is a bit like the' Pelican Brief ' era, which also stars Denzel Washington. There just wasn't enough quality, and even though it is watchable- there is no great feeling to the movie. I think there was definitely a period around the late 80's early 90's when a load movies were made like this (lawyer movies, political espionage where some triumphed like ' Erin Brokovic' and quite a lot failed to deliver.",Philadelphia

There's a major reason why Hanks character was made out to be such a ""model citizen""...i.e intelligent, successful, hard working, compassionate individual, who makes positive contributions to society. That purpose was to show that bigotry is blind to all that is truly significant...the quality &/or ""soul"" of an individual. That is best shown & learned through Washingtons character. Once Wahingtons character got through his own hang-ups, concerning his client, he found out that Andrew Beckett was much more than a homosexual w AIDS...Beckett was a quality human-being,",Philadelphia

Its a a very emotional and sad story which touches your heart. If you are sentimental better have lot of tissues. Tom hanks as usual is at his best and this may sound a bit crazy but i really felt the make up was excellent.If u didn't know this it wud be quite a shock that tom has AIDS in the movie. He is fired becz of that and he files a suit against the company and finally wins the case. One more shocking news is he is a GAY. I know it may sound weird and crazy and u may just want to skip the movie but its really worth it and is a very nice movie with good sentiments.Don't expect any great twists and logical statements in the jury part .. its more of sentimental than logical fighting,Philadelphia

176,kitteh_harbls,Garbage. The bad kind of garbage.,1,26 October 2006,"There ARE good kinds of garbage (e.g. Gigli) that are so, so bad that they actually become watchable. But Philadelphia is the kind of garbage that is so, so bad in a BAD way. The movie just takes itself so seriously it's simply laughable. The director likely believes that the film is a humanitarian message.Let's get this out of the way: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington gave GREAT performances, especially Denzel. . Now, to the movie: the movie is so overly indulged in 'emotion' and musical cues that it becomes so embarrassingly sappy and unwatchable. I take solace in knowing that there are OTHER innocent people who were abused by such cringe-inducing scenes like the opera/red light scene, which counts as one of the most hideous abuses of ""director's privileges"" ever; an utterly embarrassing scene to watch any way you look at it. The movie is literally STUFFED with rubbish like that, like the defense attorney looks at Becket for a couple of seconds before saying, ""Andrew Becket is dying"", or the whole scene near the end where Becket has to take his shirt off to show the jury his lesions. The music, the bosses turning their heads away, the look on Hanks' face, Wow. The director is begging us to cry. Oh, I did feel like crying, but for a completely different reason. The only reason I feel content giving this movie one star (as opposed to the much sought-after zero stars, which exists in review titles only) is because of Denzel's performance. Avoid this piece of feces at all costs.",Philadelphia

Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, the Jonathan Demme and Tak Fujimoto. tom Hanks above all was 10005 convincing as the betrayed lawyer who must fight his disease and fight his wrongful termination. Demme made the decision to shoot the film simply and subtle, except for in-your face close-ups and Fujimoto made it so. But Denzel Washington was the perfect counterpart to Hanks' character. Many people don't realize it but Denzel is us, the audience. He represents our transformation as we build a bond built on understanding and empathy. We change as he changes and that makes him a pivotal character in the film. Denzel often doesn't get much love. He is highly underrated, even with his Oscar win. He's only has one or two $100 million dollar films, yet most of his performances have been critically acclaimed.Philadelphia would not be the same without him.",Philadelphia
179,DickNay,Extremely Depressing But Ultimately Rewarding,9,6 January 2007,"When comparing the Denzel Washington of old with the Denzel of today, it depresses me. In the 1980s and '90s, Mr. Washington sold himself as a great actor - and he was. These days, he plays characters that are extremely angry, for one reason or another. (I mean, for crying out loud, he made a movie called ""Man on Fire."" It seems that is the epitome of Denzel Washington today. Too bad.) But in 1993, Mr. Washington made a wonderful movie called ""Philadelphia"" with Tom Hanks, and Antonio Banderas. Denzel plays Joe Miller, a self-promoting homophobe, who also happens to be a lawyer. Mr. Hanks plays Andy Beckett, an AIDS patient, and a once up-and-coming lawyer who was fired from his prestigious law firm because he supposedly misplaced an important document, though Beckett maintains someone moved it, trying to implicate him. After much deliberation, Joe takes the case, but tells his wife the homosexuals still gross him out. The court scenes take up most of the film's two hours, and they are brilliantly executed by the director, Jonathan Demme (that's right, the ""Silence of the Lambs"" guy.) That is to say the court scenes are very intense, mostly because we have grown to hate Andy's ex-law firm so much. Jason Robards leads the team of evildoers, as Charles Wheeler, Andy's ex-boss, who has, to put it lightly, a problem with Andy's lifestyle. The movie is an emotional powerhouse, featuring exceptional acting from Mr. Hanks and Mr. Washington. The film remains fairly realistic, saving a few court scenes and the ending, penned by Ron Nyswaner. ""Philadelphia"" is a very depressing film, but it's a hell of a lot better than ""Rent.""",Philadelphia
180,LeBallz,Potentially Fascinating Subject Matter Squandered by Poor Directing,3,1 September 2019,"Coming out of retirement to review this hugely disappointing movie. Philadelphia is the equivalent of Schindler's List if it were directed by Michael Bay. In other words, it missed the damn point. As the story of a talented lawyer, wrongfully terminated because he has AIDS, it would seem extremely rich with thematic material. Unfortunately, the director focuses so much on the wrong aspects, specifically Denzel Washington's boring character arc and quasi path to enlightenment. The best directors know that with heavy drama you either get out of the way (like Clint Eastwood) or you elevate the drama through artistry (like Alfonso Cuaron). Unfortunately, Demme simply isn't talented enough to elevate the material and obviously cannot direct actors because every..single..character feels so hollow, so stiff, so one dimensional. Good guys are good (and love opera) bad guys are bad (and love money) and that's basically the only two buckets that exist in this alternate universe. The negative stereotypes of LGBTQ society run deep and become self limiting, forcing Hanks and Banderes (the best actor in the movie by far) into boxes they can't stretch out of. Even the court room drama is so reductionist that it's insulting to the audience. I guess Demme was riding high off of Silence of the Lambs and was given a free pass on this one. So much potential wasted by a director who chose narrow zeitgeist over timelessness.",Philadelphia
181,sisyphus-12,Propaganda Posing as Art,1,13 October 2000,"You really can't make a movie about ""being gay,"" or, more pointedly, ""being-gay-and-discriminated-against"" and not have the movie judged primarily as an agenda-flick, especially when the characters are as two-dimensional as they are in this story. Tom Hanks plays a gay man who for a brief, sad time in his life was sexually promiscuous. He caught AIDS.
His character doesn't work--he is a stereotype, or, rather, what the filmmakers would *like* to be a stereotype, I think: the sensitive, intelligent, put-upon Gay Man. His employers, who fire him immediately upon finding out he is gay and has AIDS, are stereotypical  Villains. They seem to have very little to talk about (particularly around poor Tom Hanks!) other than gays, which of course they do in a  coarse and insensitive manner. They are the Cold-Hearted Homophobes.Denzel Washington is Hanks' lawyer, the Homophobe-Who-Becomes-More-Human by knowing the Gay Man.Sound puerile? It is. What the filmmakers have failed to realize is that if you REALLY want to present a human drama, you can't keep the characters as two-dimensional as they are in Philadelphia. Hanks needs to be more than a Sensitive Gay Man. Jason Robards needs to be more than the Cruel Homophobe. And so on. In real life, people aren't that simple. This kind of b&w morality works in Hollywood adventure movies, but it doesn't work in art.
In addition to ignoring the complexities of human character, this movie totally ignores the complexites of the AIDS issue, and gay rights, simplifying them into a thin gruel of unthinking, maudlin, propaganda. This movie is a tearjerker if all you want is to have your position on the AIDS/Gay issue confirmed, but sorry mistake if you expect something with aesthetic merit, or thought-provoking content.",Philadelphia

At a time when uncertainty and fear surrounded this terrible disease, Philadelphia turned on a light. This is in my opinion Tom Hanks' best performance. He plays a HIV Positive homosexual, suddenly fired from his esteemed position within a business. Denzel Washington plays the lawyer that takes up his case. Apart from brilliant performances, the film glows with a skillfully driven narrative and beautiful cinematography. The score also compliments the film beautifully. The Opera scene is possibly the most powerful moment in any film I have ever seen. Many criticisms of this film lie in over-sentimentality, but I believe these views are unfounded - Philadelphia is tragic, but that doesn't make it a weepy. Ultimateley, Philadelphia is about the will to go on and appreciate every moment. Prejudism has no place.

He is undoubtedly the best actor in today's age.Denzel Washington's first reaction when he learns about Tom's disease and cautiously scrutinizes every item touched by Tom, exposes the prejudices of literate, educated people, mainly due to their own ignorance. Unfortunately, even today these prejudices exist. And the helpless, distraught look on Tom's face after being let down for the tenth time by another prejudiced lawyer is heart wrenching. The court room scenes are the highlight of the movie. The cruel, cold-hearted treatment Tom Hanks is subjected to is a lesson for all of us on the need to be sensitive to others state of mind. But even today, even when we all know who is guilty and who is innocent, we still need to prove it in the court of law. Having a supportive family is good, but we live in a society and we also need them to accept us for our distinct nature and individualism. Slowly, Denzel realizes that he is not just fighting for a law that has been broken, a lot more than the law has been broken and that is what he is fighting for.The songs at the beginning and ending of the movie are aptly worded and sung to perfection.All in all a beautiful, sensitive movie and a path breaking one too.",Philadelphia

Tom Hanks' performance was obviously worthy of his first Oscar for his portrayal of Andrew Beckett, a gay, AIDS-stricken man who was fired from his job for what he believes to be discrimination against his sexual orientation and disease.  Denzel Washington, in his portrayal of Joe Miller, the ex-homophobic who decides to help Andrew win his case, is excellent, deserving of a Best Supporting Actor award.

186,kevhol2000,Compelling Film about Human Beings,8,22 July 2002,"Yes, films like ""And the Band Played Slowly"" deal more factually about the issues dealing with AIDS. Yes, the film does ""sell out"" by depicting a homosexual character with AIDS who never seems to show affection for his male partner beyond a little hugging. Yes, the characters in this film are played by actors who are almost universally liked, and distract the viewers from the compelling reality that AIDS affects many people who engage in behavior that to many people is morally ambiguous. Yes, and most importantly, this film is flawed as a story because its plot is related to the status of courtroom drama.Yet, aside from these apparent roadblocks, ""Philadelphia"" is a beautiful drama. The beauty of this film lies in the way certain scenes captivate the soul, and unleash the universal patterns of humanity that most of us share. Take for instance, the scene where Andrew's boyfriend is angered by Andrew's apparent lack of interest in anything else other than work. The dialogue in this scene, the anger and compassion exhibited by Banderas, and the look of emotional tenderness by Hanks, is positively sublime. This scene exhibits the love these two characters share that is both tender and original. This scene is a better example of love than any make out session.There are also many other wonderful scenes. The scene where Andrew talks with his caring family, the famous opera scene with virtuoso performances by Hanks and Washington, and the final heartbreaking scene, showing Andrew as a child playing in the ocean.The theme of this film, I think, is spoken by a previous employee of Andrew's lawfirm who received HIV by transfusion. She states quite clearly that its not about who's fault it is, or why you got the disease, you just try to survive with it. Those naysayers of this film seem to miss this important point. We should all have the love of life that Andrew seems to have. Yet, we should all feel privileged to continue a life that people like Andrew lose every day. I think, what offends people the most, is that Philadelphia is not really about an issue. It is really about a human being who doesn't want to lose his life, but has bravely accepted it anyways. 8/10",Philadelphia

Demme wants to make clear that everyone of us is affected. For that reason he goes through the streets of Philadelphia and shows people from every social layer, in every spot, in every situation, to show that we all are equal when it comes to AIDS. And then, later, in the movie, the characters look into the camera every once in a while. Everybody shall be talked to, it shall be impossible to turn around and look away. Like Kubrick Demme uses the vanishing point perspective and pulls the spectator into the action of the story. And then there is that great song by Bruce Springsteen, ""Streets of Philadelphia"", the boss wrote a lot of great songs but this one will outlast. It is not able to criticize Tom Hanks' performance, which is simply stunning as is the rest of the cast. At very few moments Demme exaggerates a bit or is a bit too idealistic.

The acting by every single actor in this film was above amazing but i have to mention Tom Hanks. This is by far one of the best if not the best role i have ever seen him play, what an amazing and talented man. The role of Andy would have been a very difficult character to play, but Hanks completely nailed it. Denzel Washington was again amazing, and i must give mention to Antonio Banderas. Both were A+. At the beginning of this film, I was wondering how it was going to pan out as it was, as i mentioned at the start, focused on very sensitive issues and the social values at the time would have been vastly different to what they are today, but at the end I was nearly in tears because of the way the film gripped you into Andy's situation and how powerful the motif of friendship and compassion was. A very well made film. The character development was at its best and the plot and screen writing was very well done. I also noticed the Mise en Scene lighting in this film which gave the characters even more emotion. I am not quite sure how to put into words, how I feel about this movie and how it moved me. But overall it was a fantastic experience that I think everyone should see at least once in their lives, even if they oppose the issues dealt with in this film.

Tony Curtis was denied of an Oscar nomination for Some Like it Hot, and the movie was even banned in Kansas (what a surprise).  But then in the early 80's, a time when glam rockers were wearing makeup and had long hair, there was a surge of gender-bending roles, starting with Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie.  There was also Julie Andrews and Robert Preston in Victor/Victoria and John Lithgow in The World According to Garp.  Then, in 1985, there was in my opinion the greatest ""gay"" performance of all time, William Hurt in Kiss of the Spider Woman (I was surprised that the Academy actually had the guts to give him the Oscar that he deserved hands down).But then the 90s came roaring in, and people seemed to feel guilty about the open-mindedness, and a new wave of homophobia set in.  But there was also a wave of political correctness, and I think some ground-breaking films were made, like Longtime Companion in 1991.  Jaye Davidson also gave a phenomenal performance in The Crying Game.  But there still was never really a wide-release Hollywood film that dealt with homosexuality.  Then came Philadelphia.When I first saw this movie, there was no doubt in my mind that Tom Hanks would go on and win the Oscar that year.  First of all, it took a lot of guts for him to even take this role, because God forbid people in Hollywood think you're gay.  And there were so many phenomenal scenes that he really just nailed.  Like the scene when he's listening to the music (I don't want to give any spoilers), it was really just amazing.  Jonathan Demme, fresh off his Oscar win for Silence of the Lambs, also does a great job in directing.I really think this movie deserved a Best Picture nomination.  I also think Jason Robards deserved a Best Supporting actor nomination.  I know that his character was truly just an idiot stuck in the 50s, but a movie like this needs a villian, the absolute homophobe to round out the story.  There wouldn't be a movie without the homophobic dumb ass, would there?  I also think he is a great actor.So all you people who criticize this movie (homophobic, perhaps?) should really take into consideration the groundbreaking that this movie did.

The whole movie is just geared around making you feel sorry for someone that is persecuted for having AIDS and being gay.

191,daniel1974nl,Demme delivers once more,9,21 March 2004,"Its a long time that I have seen this move for the first time. They just released a new SE here on DVD which I thought I should watch again. Normally Jonathan Demme is getting (deserved though) all his credit for the making of Silence Of The Lambs, also a magnificent film, but I cannot stop thinking this indeed was his best film. Personly I think that Philadelhia was much beter, more toching and more close to reality. This one really maked you think about alot of things, and Im happy to see that Demme makes a firm political statement in discrimination and shows the audience its not allowed under and circumstance. A nice touch to know that Philadelphia is indeed the place where Washington, Madison, Hamilton (Jefferson was in Paris & Adams in Londen at that time) and the other founding fathers forged the most liberal state in the world. Their constitution surely would have aplied on this move. Or as Denzel Washinton is saying. ""All men are born equal.""I though Tom Hanks was as good as he always was and was acting on the level of Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Road To Perdition & Saving Private Ryan. The academy Award commitee occasionaly does seem to recognise real quality by giving the Oscars to the right person.",Philadelphia
192,Tenenbaum21,The most emotional drama ever written.,10,21 September 2002,"Philadelphia is a truly wonderful, unforgetting film that looks into the life of Andrew Beckett, a homosexual with the AIDS virus. This film particularly highlights the feelings and strong emotions of Beckett and his caring family. The film's main plot is about a homosexual with AIDS (Beckett played by Tom Hanks)who is fired from his law firm after gaining a big promotion. Andy Beckett claims that he was fired because his employers were prejudice towards himself and his disease. He decides to hire a lawyer to take his case to court and he finds Denzal Washington. Denzal Washington played a wonderful part in this film and deserved to be nominated by the ""Academy"" for Best Supporting Actor. However, Washington didn't win, but won for two other films. I don't believe anyone can say enough good things about Mr. Tom Hanks and his wonderful acting in all of his roles (especially Philadelphia). Hanks executed his character in an absolutely perfect sense. Hanks made you cry more than once in this particular film when he couldn't find anyone to help him go to court. The graphic scenes containing lesions, which were a result of the virus, made you cringe. The makeup on Hanks couldn't of been better. The ""Academy"" came through with this film awarding Hanks and the talented Jonathan Demme (the director) with Oscars. Different Oscars also went to other persons for this film. This film will make you cry several times and I would highly recommend that you rent this film for a cold, rainy afternoon. If you are worried about seeing gays kissing and hugging, don't worry. The homosexual sense isn't that bad in this film. Bottom Line- Philadelphia will never be forgotten in good cinema!",Philadelphia
193,prima-angkasa,excellent movie,10,6 March 2009,"Philadelphia was an amazing story to be told, for just like so many other human tragedies, for us the unaffected to be able to see just one example up close and personal. I hope it had some positive impact in creating compassion among the general public and can inspired us.Andrew's lover, Miquel, played by Antonio Banderas. I found this part of the movie to be most touchy. The bond of affection and love between Antonio and Tom is so wonderfully portrayed amazing and beautiful. It is all body language! The relationship between Andrew and his lover is understood from their body language and it teaches us that it is hardly different from the kind of love and affection we all share for each other. My favorite scene between them is when they dance, holding hand together, we can see how much Andrew and Miquel love each other, and the other hand, Joe miller looks at them and understand that love is universal. We are also shown Andrew's parents and family who loves him much.Tom Hanks was fantastic, as usual. Denzel Washington is so good in this role specially the scene where Hanks get him to listen to his favorite opera. This scene is just stunning and touchy. memorable quote ""consider me a three years old kid"", the last court scenes and the over all goal of the movie which is to say that no body has the right to judge you, destroy your career even if you are dying, and most importantly consider himself a God above your sins no matter what were they and chooses to treat you like crap. I guess this strong message was well delivered to all of us.",Philadelphia
194,weezer76,A Leftist View of Justice,2,21 August 2002,"Aside from the political biases that obviously motivated the making of this film, I thought Hanks' character was absolutely flat and showed little depth of emotion.  Denzel Washington's character was just a re-hash of all his characters from that era: strident, using the high-strung, clipped-speech, and contrived.  The other characters were obviously props to propel the non-homosexual writers' and producers' kid-glove vision of homosexuality, a major criticism that is supported by many of the pertinent reviews here. What was the point of this film?  To make us feel sorry for a character whose own immoral lifestyle choices were the proximate cause of his eventual unemployment (and undoing)?  The sheer audacity of such an approach made the performances of Hanks and Washington seem more contrived than they already were.",Philadelphia
195,The_Scientist-86,Absolutely astonishing!! Hanks' best performance!!!,10,23 August 2004,"I only saw this film recently after I saw the special edition DVD for sale at only £5.99. I bought it and watched it as soon as i took it home and I thought it was amazing. Jonathan Demme's direction was great too. but the two best things about it was Tom Hanks' performance as the lawyer with aids and Bruce Springsteen's song "" Streets of Philadelphia"". I always thought that Liam Neeson's performance in Schindler's List was what should've recieved the Oscar in 1993. But when I eventually saw Philadelphia a few weeks ago, I could see why Hanks won. Denzel Washington as the homophobic but supportive lawyer is also great. The three, Hanks, Washington and Demme make a good team. The film is wonderful.",Philadelphia

I never thought i would like it so that is why i never bothered to watch it all the way through. I finally decided to watch it so i didn't have to put up with my mother watching her stupid soap opera young and the restless. well anyways, at first i was kind of uneasy about watching it but i did, and i must say, I am EXTREMELY glad that i did finish it. it has to be one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, it just broke my heart, and after it made me think. Homosexuals are just like everyone else only they love people their same sex different. This movie made me cry, and i hate to say it, at times it even made me laugh. What broke my heart the most was at the end of the movie when they were all watching the little home movies from when Andreww Bekkett was just a little boy. i bawled my heart out. This was a great movie and i will most definitely be watching it again. The only regret i have about the whole movie was not watching it all the way through sooner.",Philadelphia
197,kel-8,"Moving, yet...",9,5 March 2001,"This was an incredibly moving film.  It makes you stop and realize some of the discrimination gays and aids victims go through.  But I found it a bit unrealistic on some levels.  Andrew Becket's family was way too understanding an compassionate.  I've never met a family that was so accepting of a gay member.  At least someone turns their back, or hides their children...  And I doubt the trial would have been won in real life in the 90's.  As time progresses, the law is getting behind more discriminated minorities, but not then.  The movie was wonderful, stirring, moving.  It left me with hope, that the world may get better for gays and aids victims. But it left me crying imagining my own child in that position.  I also speak all of this as a Christian who believes that the act of homosexual sex is a sin, but we are all sinners, aren't we?  I pray for a day when families are like they are in this film, and when people cannot fire someone based on anything which they fear--sexual orientation, color, race, creed, religion.......",Philadelphia

Before the film I was so anti-gay and with the opinion that AIDS was self-inflicted, but this film taught me to respect the gay community and be more sympathetic to the disease. Tom Hanks was starring in films such as ""Big"" only five years previous to this film, and to see just how powerful his performance is here is the mark of a truly great and talented actor. I have just finished watching the movie, and along with the bonus disc with the powerful making of ""People Like Us: Making Philadelphia"", this is truly one of the most powerful movies of the 1990s. It was 1993. ""Schindler's List"" was the Best Picture (according to the Academy Awards), but ""Philadelphia"" was my best of '93.

201,slipbyron,Philadelphia,9,24 November 2007,"Andrew Beckett is a University of Pennsylvania law-school graduate who works for the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia. Andy is successful, easy-going, secretly gay, and an AIDS patient. Because his boss Jason Wheeler has a strong prejudice against gay people, Andy hides the truth about his sexuality along with his life partner, Miguel Alvarez from the members of the firm. Though not a full partner in the firm, his legal performance is exceptional, and he is promoted to the post of Senior Associate (one step beneath full partnership) and he is assigned the most important case the firm has taken on.His condition has reached the stage when he has developed Kaposi's Sarcoma, a form of cancer marked by multiple tumors on the lymph nodes and skin. He has been using make-up to cover the lesions, but a member of the firm notices one that has appeared on his forehead. On the last day that they can file the papers in the case he has been assigned, he has finished the necessary forms for the case to be submitted. Leaving the paperwork on his desk in plain sight, he informs the clerk about it, instructing him to file them with the court, and he leaves. An hour later, the clerk phones him asking where the papers are  they are not on his desk. Additionally, all of the copies on his computer's hard drive have been erased. His work had been sabotaged and he is promptly fired from the law firm the next day.Andrew tries to hire a lawyer to take his case and sue the firm for illegal dismissal, lost earnings, and punitive damages, but nobody will take an AIDS patient as a client. One of the attorneys he attempts to hire is Joe Miller, a family man and injury lawyer against whom he had argued in an earlier case. Andrew's appearance is markedly different from when Miller saw him previously, and when Andrew reveals that he has AIDS, Miller's entire mood changes. Miller is homophobic and not knowledgeable about how AIDS is spread, fearing that Andrew's handling of objects in his office can spread the disease. Miller steadfastly refuses to take Andrew's case for personal reasons, and is so fearful that he later gets a checkup from his doctor.Ultimately, Andrew is compelled to act as his own attorney. They encounter each other again at a law library where Andrew has been doing research; people in the room are leaving the immediate area when they see him and one librarian attempts to persuade him to move to a private room. Miller is disgusted with the behavior he is witnessing  behavior he was guilty of when earlier discussing the homosexual lifestyle with his wife Lisa  and, after going over some of the material Andrew had already prepared, decides to take the case. After Miller gives the firm a summons during a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game, Wheeler and the other partners discuss wanting to find out if Beckett is a member of any LGBT rights groups and frequents gay bars.Andrew and Joe gain great trust and respect for each other as they fight a David v. Goliath case, much to the shock, admiration, and, for some, disgust of the population. Miller must show that Andrew is a good man, not a threat, and that his boss fired him under fraudulent pretenses as he begins to realize that gay and bisexual people are still human beings with feelings. As the case goes before the court, the partners of the firm take the stand one-by-one, and commit open perjury  smearing Andrew's name, claiming he was incompetent, and deliberately tried to hide his condition and sexual orientation. Andrew had planned to tell his employers about his homosexuality - but after hearing his coworkers and the firm's head lawyer, Charles Wheeler, tell a homophobic joke in their athletic club's sauna, abandoned the idea. Alleging that the partners learned of his illness from a lesion on his forehead, Beckett's case is proved graphically to the jury when Miller asks him to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand, revealing that his lesions were indeed visible and recognizable as such.Later, during Wheeler's cross-examination by Miller, Andrew has a blackout in court and goes into his final medical crisis. Andrew does prevail in court and the jury orders the firm to make a large payout, consisting of $140,000 in back pay, $100,000 for pain and suffering and $4,000,000 in punitive damages. He learns of the victory as his family gathers around him at the hospital. Andrew's head has been shaved, and he's been blinded in one eye by the vicious seizures and medication. He removes his oxygen mask to speak to Miller when the attorney arrives (to great Beckett family fanfare). When Andrew, at one time, struggles to breathe, the previously phobic Miller replaces the mask on Andrew's face, touching his skin in the process. Miller knows this is the last time he will speak to his client and friend, but yet says, ""I'll see you soon"". Finally, all the family says their goodbyes and Andrew is left to spend his final moments with Miguel. Miguel dims the lights in the room, and begins kissing the fingers of his lover. Andrew removes his mask and tells Miguel...",Philadelphia
202,mimi_murlough,"Leaves you asking for more, but not necessarily in a good way",6,27 May 2010,"First of all, I get why this movie was so praised and so famous, I really do. The subject was perfect for its time, the actors brilliant, and the message delivered sensitively. The writers carefully picked apart most of the prejudices that people still have towards homosexuals and AIDS victims in an entertaining way, they showed us what homophobia really is, and gave us characters that you feel deeply for. That said, there is no denying that Philadelphia is severely limited. Facts stands that this was made for the heterosexual public to deal with an urgent subject in 1993, and that is glaringly obvious, even though it was probably just what the doctor ordered.17 years after this was a burning question, and for someone who isn't a member of the straight target audience, that means that the central plot became much too simplistic for my tastes, and what did get me hooked on the movie was the promising conflicts that were, quite sadly, barely hinted at. Take Andy's and Miguel's relationship for example. They give more affection to friends and family than each other, yet nobody seems to acknowledge it. Then we have Miguel's obsession with nursing Andy clashing with Andy's denial and Andy throwing a huge party when Miguel asks for more of his time. On top of that we have the exposed infidelity, which combined with Miguel's near serenity right before and after Andy's death makes me wonder whether their relationship really survived that crisis, or whether it was the guilt of leaving a fatally ill man that kept them together. In other words, while the very overt kind of discrimination against homosexuals that is shown here is becoming something that we can relate to less and less, relationships in crisis and the impact that a fatal disease have on the people around its victim is something that most of us are going to live through.On the other hand, some of these hinted conflicts may very well just be a clear demonstration of how neglected Andy's personal life was. While it is apparent that the writers tried to create an impression of who he was outside of his career with the huge family and many friends, there are simply too many of them; the screen time is just not enough for us to get to know all of his siblings, nephews, in laws and friends. The result is that they become a faceless mass of spectators, and we end up learning nothing at all about Andy. And if you look at what I've written about his relationship to Miguel, the one that has received some care at least, you can see that it's badly inconsistent. How can the man who bosses his boyfriend's doctors around and get a minor breakdown over a missed treatment possibly have become the man who is passively listening to a doctor while looking no more than concerned, and then lets his lover die while barely blinking, all within a week? It seems that his actions are more based on what makes Andy look good than what fits his character, and as I've noted, that only make their relationship come across as suspicious. Andy's own personality leaves a lot of questions too, and with some unfortunate implications in their wake. Just how did a man raised in what seems to be a fairly traditional family, graduated from an old, prestigious university and working for a conservative law firm get so comfortable with having his stereotypical gay friends come over on a sick day á la the stereotypical ""framily""? How did he fit so well in with the rest of the community that he could throw a huge drag/masquerade party complete with a barbershop choir and a band? This seems to be two parts of his life that are different as night and day, and much like Miguel's behavior, we are never given an explanation of how he manages to tie them together. Once again the information we get about Andy only makes it seem like he has every personality and none at the same time.To sum up, this film could be seen as having two aspects of a story of good quality. The first would be what it was praised for in 1993, for picking apart a problem of society that was acute then and bringing it to attention. The second would be what could have made Philadelphia interesting for future generations and what could have spoken to the people that it was supposed to portray. But the scales tipped heavily in favor of the former aspect, making the film fade into obscurity when the novelty wore off, and leaves me wishing for a remake that would take pity on the potential wasted in this movie.",Philadelphia

However it is this scene when the leading role, Andrew, explained the opera aria from Andrea Chenir that makes me rediscover the richness of this film.In the anguish, Maria Callas sang ""Look, the place that cradled me is burning."" However, the music switched from sorrowful to extremely hopeful ""It was during this sorrow that love came to me."" and ""Live still, I am life. Heaven is in your eyes. Is everything around you just the blood and mud? I am divine. I am oblivion. I am the god... that comes down from the heavens, and makes of the Earth a heaven. I am love!... I am love."" Andrew's lawyer, Joe, had originally hurried Andrew to practice Q & A, but in the end, he was stunned by Andrew's expression about the opera aria. He then understood that Andrew had reached the state of mind that he had no regret whatever would happen because he had brought the earth love, like the opera aria had depicted. Influenced by this state of mind, Joe went home hugging his daughter and wife, and all the worries in real life were put aside at that moment.Andrew has overcome his unfortunate experience, and even death.",Philadelphia

Good things like the passion for music, the understanding in the couples, the friendship. Logic such as established prejudices (I'm not sure if I'm telling it right)and the idiosyncrasy of a kind of people. Bad things like pure racism and discrimination. But above all, the hope. The hope in the world that we live and its rights and laws.Speaking of rights, what a great decision was the Oscar prize, Tom Hanks were great, specially the part when you only see him and listen to the song, he doesn't speak but he doesn't have to either, just his face tells us everything.",Philadelphia
207,Angel-77,Gay Men Are Macho Too,8,13 December 1998,"Philadelphia is a truly amazing movie and a touching story.  Tom Hanks plays a lawyer who has been stricken with a horrible disease.  He plays a convincing role as Andrew Beckett, a man who knows the meaning of justice and knows what exactly his rights are.  What Mr. Hanks also accomplishes with this role is he breaks free from the stereotypes society has dictated on the average gay man.  Andrew Beckett is not feminine in any way, he does not have a flair for shoe shopping or hold his arms limp-wristed or talk with a lisp.  For these reasons, it has been said that Tom Hanks was not believable as a gay man.  I strongly disagree.  Andrew Beckett is a normal man who enjoys smoking cigars and takes joy in the law.  Who would think he was gay?  This is precisely the point the movie is trying to make.  A gay man may be walking among you, every day you may see him at school, may play raquetball with him at the gym, may work late hours with him at the office... but yet you'd never suspect he is gay because he does not wear loafers decorated with tassels and he has a low-pitched voice.  Men are men, whether gay or not, and should be treated as such -- gays do not deserve special treatment but they deserve equal treatment.  Because in most areas, gay men are just like straight men.  I commend Tom Hanks for showing the world that gay men can be just as manly as any other.  His Oscar was well-deserved and the movie was amazingly ground-breaking.",Philadelphia
208,evanxi,"Sad, but something everybody should see...",9,16 April 2006,"This beautiful, sad movie is, in my opinion, something everyone should see in our troubled times. A revealing story about the struggle of a man with AIDS, this movie was eye-opening. The movie stands strongly against discrimination, and in pursuit of law, order, & justice. The story is very well written, giving life and sincerity to a movie that could have easily been too political for the average viewer. With such a great story, and with the excellent talent of Mssrs Hanks, Banderas, and Washington, I would rate this one of the best hard-hitting dramas of the '90s. Cinematography was good, camera work was interesting, and the pace of the film was right on track. The musical score really stood out to me, adding depth and emotion to the film. Also, Mr. Banderas' performance in this film has increased my opinion of him as an actor ten-fold, and has helped me see things in other films of his. Overall, a touching, sad, and fiercely-charged movie, it is highly recommended and is sure to remain on the 'must-see' lists for a long time.",Philadelphia
209,drewpat,An unrealistic portrayal...,3,12 June 2001,"Tom Hanks' Oscar for this film really galled me.  As a gay man with HIV, I found his portrayal of Andrew to be entirely devoid of any hint of the inner - or outer - truth of a human being in this situation.  The film as a whole struck me as pablum designed to appeal to a mainstream (heterosexual) audience, disregarding the realities of the lives of gay men.  For a more realistic portrayal I'd suggest ""Parting Glances"" or even ""Longtime Companion;"" and for those who can take it - it is a truly devastating film - ""Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt.""",Philadelphia

I liked the song that Bruce Springsteen sings in the beginning. It's called ""Streets of Philadelphia"". I thought Hanks won a well deserved academy award ""Best Actor"". He also won it for ""Forrest Gump"". Although I also think Washington should have won the academy award ""Best Supporting Actor"", although he won that award for ""Glory"".

I'm talking about Antonio Banderas. Of course, he's a great actor, but to my opinion he has nothing to do in this movie. May be his role was too short and third-degreed to show up all the abilities of Mr. Banderas as an actor, but there were a number of roles in this film even smaller, but performed wonderfully. Beckett's junior brother, for example, drove me to tears in the farewell scene. But Antonio is totally unconvincing. It's not his kind of movies, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong - I have included my e-mail. And there is another thing that bothers me: Why ""Philadelphia""? I mean, what the creators wanted to say with this title? Surely, this is not a local problem. Even more, there's been shown very little of the city itself - all the action happens in the courtroom. So I think the film, so to speak, remains untitled. But again, correct me if I'm wrong.Finally, I gave it 9 out of 10. And who knows, what would I have given it, if Andrew's boyfriend was played not by Antonio Banderas. Anyway, like I said, it's a great film, and I highly recommend it to everyone.

222,dyg953,Great acting and important!,10,28 March 2005,"Why did I give this movie 10 stars? I must admit I was a little skeptic about the movie concept in the beginning, but when I saw the 2 actors together (Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington) I was blown away. Their chemistry on set is incredible. And the whole music part in this movie is great. No wonder Tom Hanks won the academy award, but in my book Denzel could also have received it.Antonio Banderas is also in the movie, and it is the first time the audience see him in a great movie, he is doing a great job, and I believe this film helped him become who he is today. I must say this is one of the greatest movies of all time, it is a must see. Watch the movie and enjoy a moment of greatness. The movie went right into my heart, and I will never forget it.",Philadelphia
223,onikawathefifth5,Mesmerizing and heart touching,10,27 March 2020,"Philadelphia is an amazing piece of cinema that mesmerizes your soul and touches your heart in every single scene. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington provide so much depth to their characters in their close-up shots and do an exceptional job of portraying the internal perspectives and conflicts of their own respective characters. Following Joe Miller, Denzel Washington, as he finds himself struggling in an internal fight between his old, bigoted, and homophobic views and his new found values of love and sympathy, not only for the familiar, but for all that deserve to be loved, and watching this new found value push him past discrimination and prejudice is a holy experience. At the same time, it is absolutely tormenting and heartbreaking to watch Andrew Beckett, Tom Hanks, fight AIDS and the prejudice against AIDS patients while he marches towards an accepted death. The La Mamma Morta sequence is without a doubt one of the most spectacular scenes I have seen in my life as Tom Hanks's performance and Denzel Washington's internalization of his character are magical. The directing choices of Jonathan Demme, rest in peace and may the soil on his grave be plenty, as well as his subtle use of instruments are fascinating and on point. I would recommend seeing this movie alone or with people whose company you truly enjoy to get the full experience.",Philadelphia

If I hadn't waited to see it, I wouldn't have the full appreciation that I have now. When the movie ended around 10 minutes ago, I had tears in my eyes. I don't get emotional for movies, but this one certainly warranted it. I was touched on a very deep level, even though I'm only 18 and straight.

I just watched it actually and, I'm still crying. Tom Hanks' role in the film was excellent; consequently, Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. The thought of a homosexual white man with AID's hiring a homophobic African American man as a lawyer was brilliant. It shows the comparison of the two worlds, and explains thoroughly how AIDS is a terrible disease. When Antonio Bandares is with Tom Hanks at the end in the hospital, oh my, that part was hard for me to watch. AIDS and Homosexuality is very abundant in our society today and I think that by watching this movie it will help people understand how serious this illness is. This movie , on a scale of 1-10 is a 16. Believe me, it is worth , "" GO buy it NOW!""",Philadelphia

Denzel Washington, a well acclaimed actor, supported him in a miraculous way. They both made Philadelphia! Touching the issue which wasn't much known or probably being avoided in 90's through Phialdelphia in this way is just splendid job. A well deserved ""Best Actor Award"" for Hanks as he left you in the end speechless. Watch this for Tom and Denzel as they unite in one movie but made is a memorable one. A highly recommended movie and it has to be on your hit list, only if you hadn't watched it. Now movie is in the league of other Hanks movies like Road to Perdition, Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, The Green Mile, etc and it could also be considered as one of the best performances given by Denzel. Denzel put an impact on the audience by putting life into his character. THumbs up for both of em and thumbs up for Phialdelphia.

The emotions expressed by him as well as Denzel have made this movie a masterpiece.They have done well in showing the public a look at the bias and prejudices towards Aids and homosexuality in the society and era when to even speak of such things was taboo.The movie is powerful enough to make anyone who thinks they aren't bigots against the issues in the movie take a good look at themselves to make sure it isn't true.,Philadelphia

He played it really very good, toy really believed that he was gay. I know he is not but in this role you really thought it. Denzel Washington was also very good. I loved the sense where Andrew listens the opera. The music is so beautiful. But I also liked was that Denzel said that people how use a wheelchair should leave it outside because it may affected the jury. The role from Antonio Banderas he was also very good and you really believed him.Over all every time I see the movie I cry and It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",Philadelphia
231,alexachell2003,Just watched this again and forgotten how fantastic this film is...,10,6 October 2006,"I watched this film when it first came out when I was 13 and all I could remember about it was that it was about Aids and i cried a lot. So when I saw this in the shops for £5 I thought I would buy it as I have been meaning to watch it again for years.Sometimes when you watch a film from the early 90's you realise how dated films can get - not this film. The plight of Andrew Beckett is as true today as it was 13 years ago. Like some other users have commented, its rare to agree with Oscar but on this occasion the award could not have gone to any other than Tom Hanks. The physical change he made to play the character was visually amazing, but the emotion he put in to this part was so moving and utterly fantastic that he should have won every award possible. I cried buckets all the way through the film as I was so moved by his performance.I think one of the most poignant parts of the film is when Andrew is on the stand in court and Mary Steenburgen's character questions his lesions saying the one he claims to have on his face is barely visible so how can anyone believe that he had visible ones on his face so people knew he had AIDS? Then Denzel Wahington asks if he has any on his body LIKE the ones on his face and he says he has, on his torso. Then he opens his shirt and you the huge red lesions on his chest and everyone in court gasps. It shows the audience how much AIDS ravages the body, and how it would have been blatantly obvious to someone who had had experience with AIDS before as the law company had, that Andrew had AIDS. Its also a very moving, upsetting scene as Tom Hanks plays this character so well you genuinely care about him.Not to be overlooked in this film are Antonio Banderas and Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington shows the irony of a black person being a bigot perfectly (this was an ingenious piece of casting showing that even people who face bigots every day can be ignorant towards AIDS) and his transformation of character in the film as he gets to know Andy and his family is again, moving. I think the scene where he sees Andy dancing to the opera and narrating what is happening is a turning point for him when he realises Andy is just a normal person with the same feelings and emotions as everyone else. Antonio Banderas is also very convincing as Tom's lover - you believe them as a couple which can be rare when Hollywood take on homosexuality - they tend to camp it up a little bit which is certainly not the case with this movie.All in all, I defy anyone to not be moved by this movie. Not only is it a great movie but it also carries a very important message about the danger and ignorance surrounding AIDS. I would recommend this to anyone and it is certainly in my Top 10 films of all time.",Philadelphia
232,edpaz,A wonderful effort towards removing the stigma of AIDS,8,26 January 2002,"Hanks and Washington, are an amazing duo in this film that attempts to show the publics' prejudice and ignorance toward those afflicted with this horrendous disease.  Hanks is Hanks in this film and as usual is without peer, but Denzel Washington showed strengths he never revealed before.  The pivotal scene in this film came when Andrew (Hanks) and Joe (Washington) are preparing for Andrew's appearance on the stand at the end of the trial.  The use of Maria Callas performing La Mama Morté and Andrew showing his heart wrenching emotions as Joe looks on in astonishment was unbelievable.

Finally, I grabbed it before I changed my mind, and I am so glad I did! I wasn't quite sure what to expect at first, so I sat down to watch this only knowing who was in it and that it was about two lawyers and deals with AIDS. However, by the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, I knew it was going to be a good one. The story is such a powerful one that it shook me, and still has me a bit shaken. The acting in here was brilliant on all sides, and the story is something we can all learn from - everyone is equal. I knew that Tom Hanks had won an Oscar for his role, and after watching this I can totally understand why - one of his best performances I have ever seen.To summarize - brilliant.

Aids is real, unlike the made-for-movie romances that most people find tearjerking while i sit there wondering when its over. The part that broke that barrier was when Andy was talking about the meaning of the opera and he is saying he is life and love while crying at the same time.  i didnt even know i was crying til it was over and i cracked a smile when i saw Joe on the verge of tears from watching him.

240,vali-karr-577-202937,Philadelphia is an extraordinary touching and heartbreaking story,10,9 November 2009,"Thinking about the word "" Philadelphia"", I can visualize a beautiful city with greats prodigal buildings and a variety of entertainments. In contrast, the movie Philadelphia shows a sequence of events that contradicts the vision I had at first sight. It is a magnificent movie that reveals the explicit discrimination against a dexterous lawyer; Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett and his determination on fighting for his rights.Beckett was a homosexual who has contracted AIDS as a result of his multiple partners and unprotected sex. As been a skillful lawyer, his boss ""Charles Wheeler"" handed Beckett a case of a very significant client of the firm. However, several days after, another lawyer in the firm noticed a lesion in Becket's forehead. The lesion was a skin cancer associated with the disease. Once the word reached out the entire company, all his co-workers including his boss believed that keeping Beckett there would spread out the disease to every one in the company. So Becket has been laid off as a result of ignorance and discrimination in his workplace.Frustrated with the circumstances, Beckett decided to sue the Law Firm, but the firm was a very powerful company and no lawyer in Philadelphia wanted to take the case. One day, Beckett saw Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), on a TV commercial promising to save people's drivers license. Therefore, Beckett went to Miller's office to convince him to take his case. At first, Miller didn't like homosexuals, but agreed to take it basically for the money and reputation he would get after he won it. Several moths past, Beckett won the case but he didn't survive to enjoy the benefits that he acquired. However, he had accomplished his desire of revenge.Philadelphia is an extraordinary touching and heartbreaking story of how a lawyer fired for having AIDS attempts to fight for his rights in court. Despite of his disease and sexual choice, Beckett fought against the discrimination toward himself as an AIDS carrier. After that movie, I believe many people have changed their way of thinking towards carriers of that disease.",Philadelphia

This movie brought home that they are still the same person throughout their illness and if given support an love can live the last few days of their lives surrounded by friends, true friends with some modicum of dignity and happiness. I also saw this movie demonstrate very clearly that a mothers love is there always and forever unconditionally for there children.Mr Tom Hanks, is in my opinion one of the best actors I have ever seen and his dedication to his profession is to be commended.

243,pounds03,Philadelphia,8,10 December 2011,"Philadelphia is a wonderful film about a courageous man that decides to sue his former employer, a prestigious law firm, for a wrongful termination after they find out that he has AIDS. Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, has the deadly disease; however, he chose not to tell his colleagues about his disease. Unfortunately, the partners of the firm suspect that he has AIDS after spotting a lesion on his forehead, and within days, Beckett is terminated. Beckett brings about a lawsuit with the help of Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. At first, Miller did not want to take the case. Not only did he not agree with homosexuality, but also he was hesitant to work so closely with someone who had the AIDS virus.The theme of the movie seems to be about discrimination, in addition to fear and ignorance to the unknown. Beckett was a future partner of the firm; yet, was quickly fired once the firm found out about his disease. After asking for help from at least nine lawyers, Beckett visited Miller and asked for his help. Miller and Beckett knew each other from a previous case and Miller welcomes Beckett with a handshake, until he found out about the disease. Miller quickly backed away from Beckett, stared at his lesions, and refused to take the case. In a later scene, Beckett is at the library and is asked by the librarian to sit away from everyone else. When Beckett refuses, all those around him left their seats. As we know, AIDS cannot be transmitted through handshakes or sitting next to someone with the disease; however, once someone found out about Beckett's disease, they quickly separated themselves from him.Homosexuality is referred to several times throughout the movie and this motif is the reason for the discrimination against Beckett. As in the movie Boys Don't Cry, Beckett tries to live a normal life and tries to keep his homosexuality a secret; however, once it is discovered that he is homosexual and has AIDS, characters in the movie express their opinion about his lifestyle. In one scene, Beckett expresses his feelings to Miller with the help of an opera song. This scene is a very powerful scene and uses a red glowing light to symbolize the hurt and pain that Beckett feels as a man with AIDS and his pain of the discrimination that he receives. It is in this scene that Miller sees Beckett as more than a gay man with AIDS, but as a human being with fears and thoughts just like his own.I definitely recommend watching this movie. It gives a real insight to the everyday discrimination of people that may be different from others, and their hardships they have to overcome. It gives me a better understanding of the quote, ""Don't judge a man until you have walked a mile in his boots.""",Philadelphia
244,klein20,Philadelphia,10,11 December 2011,"""Philadelphia"" a film directed by Jonathan Demme, is a must see movie, that takes a world crisis and then shoves it in your face. The emotional screenplay written by Ron Nyswaner gets into the controversies of AIDS a virus at the time, the public feared because of lack of education and misunderstandings. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto gives viewers a warm feeling to the over all cinema. Fujimoto used camera angles that capture emotion and a feel of joy throughout the film. The music for the film was done by Howard Shore. Howard Shore created emotion within the film by using the song ""Philadelphia"" by Bruce Springsteen. ""Philadelphia"" is a movie that will warm your heart and understandings of how important it is not to be judgmental or bias. ""Philadelphia"" is about two competing lawyers Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) and Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) who join forces to tackle a law suite against the law firm Beckett was fired from because he was found to have the AIDS virus. Beckett who is a homosexual with AIDS and Miller who is a homophobic build up a unique friendship over the period of the trial and become close friends. The two friendships are immortalized in a scene after Miller attends his first homosexual party, and Beckett plays opera music. At this time Miller realizes how human everyone is, no matter what there sexual orientation might be. Tom Hanks as an actor is proved matured since his previous film Radio Flyer (1992) and is best proved in ""Philadelphia"".The film starts off with Andrew Beckett a senior associate in one of the largest corporate law firms in the city of Philadelphia being assigned to the firm's most important case. A noticeable skin lesion was noticed by a partner of the law firm on Beckett's face in the office. Because of this, Andrew Beckett was let go from his duties at the law firm. The reason for was in the finding of him having the AIDS virus. Andrew Beckett struggles to find a lawyer to help him in his discrimination case against the law firm. Beckett decides to represent himself, until Miller, finds out that he cannot contract the AIDS virus by just being around Beckett. Miller decides to take the challenge of pursuing a law suite with Beckett against the big Philadelphia law firm. As Beckett and Miller go before the courts, Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards) the head of the law firm claims that Beckett had deliberately hidden his conditions from the law firm, and because of this, Beckett was fired from the firm. The law firm represented by an emotionless lawyer Belinda Conine (Mary Streenburgen) shows no emotion when it comes to Beckett as if she is disgusted by his sexual orientation and disease. Carl Fullerton's makeup choice used in the film was classical by showing Beckets transformation of being a healthy lawyer, to being in his last stage of AIDS, to the point of death. Jonathan Demme created a realistic courtroom feel with filling in the chairs of the court with an outstanding cast and background actors. The trial ends with Beckett collapsing on the court floors. Tak Fujimoto angle used in filming this scene shows great emotion. A verdict in the favor of Beckett compensates him for his losses. Beckett passes away but is remembered by friends and family and ultimately his new friend Miller. ""Philadelphia"" is rated PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned). The film has mild language and brief nudity. Released by Tri-Star Pictures 1993, the film running time is 119 minutes.",Philadelphia

It is one of few movies that has the ability to move someone in such a way that they change their personal views and values.  Tom Hanks scores a ten, and Denzel Washington gives a performance so real to life that almost anyone can, at some point, relate to his character.  Philadelphia takes a controversial topic and puts it out there for everyone to see, and while doing this it also shows the truth behind people, how they are afraid, how some must fight, and how people change.

Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people.

247,hookco29,"Philadelphia, 1993",7,29 April 2012,"Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier.Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts ""The TV Guy"" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality.The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease.The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience.Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.",Philadelphia
248,peders02,many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS,10,26 July 2012,"Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination.The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does.The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the ""Streets of Philadelphia"" by Bruce Springsteen.The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown.The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death.The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.",Philadelphia

The trial period challenges views, values, and acceptance.",9,7 August 2012,"I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.",Philadelphia
250,Halo_Jedi,"Rich, Compelling, Deep, Magnificent Film!!",10,19 November 2007,"Before I saw this movie I rated Tom Hanks as a competent actor, always consistent and dedicated to his craft. Roles that stood out for me where undoubtedly Forrest Gump and of course The Green Mile. I came into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about the plot, characters whether it was popular or how widely known it was. My house mate had rented it out, and left it sitting on the table. I picked it up and looking at the cover saw Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington staring back. Of course with two solid and professional actors like that your pretty much guaranteed a movie of a certain standard. But still I was hesitant about watching it thinking it must be some already overdone story about two strong interesting characters coming into and then overcoming some obstacles, providing views on life and such along the way.I can't believe I almost didn't watch this movie. I wont tell you anything about the plot or the story. Because even though the plot is interesting and the story relevant, you'll have seen it done a hundred times in other movies, television or literature. The reason you will want to see this movie will be to witness Tom Hanks sink his teeth so deep into a role that he will make Forest Gump look like a training exercise. Not that it overshadows it, the opposite in fact, seeing him capable of this extraordinary performance only leaves you wondering, if you didn't already, how you didn't see before what a remarkable actor he is. If I have led you to believe that this film offers nothing more than Hank's incredible performance then that is not my intention. The film itself is staggeringly magnificent, see for yourself and let the film take you in and Tom Hanks leave you breathless.",Philadelphia

252,keele100,just saw it,9,26 May 2006,"i absolutely loved 2 scenes. the entire movie was above average but a LITTLE messy. Anway, I love the scene where miller watches Andy sing/enjoy the opera. I had gotten into the movie and started crying about 30 seconds into the scene. It was watching someone in such a vulnerable, pure moment. He has nothing to lose and is just enjoying the opera with every ounce of his human being. Also, I love when the articulate Andrew answers miller's question ""are u a good lawyer?"" damn, whoever wrote this movie is good. I loved Andrew's answer about how he loves the law. it is awesome when he says how, every once in a while, he played a role in justice being done. The reality of the situation soaks into the entire court room. It is obvious (to almost everyone's deep conscience) that justice has not been done for Andy. Awesome scenes, power, some of the best in cinema!",Philadelphia

254,jwilliams-88514,Great film!,7,21 January 2017,"The 1993 Oscar winning film Philadelphia is a moving film for all. Directed by Jonathan Demme (the same director of Silence of the Lambs) and starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington focuses on the case of Andrew Beckett, an HIV positive gay lawyer at a growing law firm. Upon discovery of his disease and his sexuality Beckett is wrongfully fired from his job despite just receiving a promotion. Andrew takes his case to court for violating the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which protects against employment discrimination with the help of an initially homophobic small town lawyer Joe Miller. Joe initially refused to help Andrew (commonly referred to as Andy), but after witnessing the discrimination that he faces decides to take on the case. Over the course of the film Miller begins to change his homophobic thoughts while Beckett fights to win his court case before he succumbs to the AIDS disease. The movie is high on emotions and sentimental feelings as we not only watch Andrew fight for his rights, but see aspects of their personal lives as well. The movie, for me, was incredibly well done, although there are some critiques.The movie played a great deal into feelings of either joy or sadness in the viewer instead of showing a wide variety of emotions from the characters. I felt that Andy, as an HIV positive man experiencing extreme discrimination, is very peaceful despite the events occurring around him. I personally would have enjoyed seeing really raw emotions such as anger or frustration in the characters instead of only the ones that tugged at the heartstrings. In addition to this, there is not a lot of romantic involvement between Andrew and his partner Miguel, which was a little disappointing. There was a lot of tender scenes between Joe and his wife, and missing that in the film felt like the movie was trying too hard to appeal to heterosexual audiences despite being a film about a gay man. However, this critique does come with the understanding that in order for Demme to have a successful movie he had to appeal to the broad audience he was aiming to reach, which was the heterosexual community. Despite these minor setbacks to the movie, the plot itself was a real threat to members of the LGBTQ community and does a good job showing what someone with AIDS might have to go through. In order to achieve the goal of being an emotional movie that hopefully opens the eyes of viewers to the world of AIDS, according to Demme, the film employed many cinematic techniques such as very slow music that swelters to a climax. This happens often during the scenes that took place in court, although there is a scene dedicated completely to Andy's love of opera music. For me this was a very odd scene but it depicted the struggle that Andy was going through and how the music made him feel as if he was not suffering the way that he was. It was a very emotional moment. The movie also used camera lighting and angles to depict important moments, especially between characters. For example, as Joe begins to overcome his homophobia the camera will begin to zoom in on his face while he is talking or looking at Andy. These relatively subtle moments depict the very small yet important changes that happen in Joe as the movie progresses. In terms of race, as Joe is an African American, his race is important from time to time. For example, when Joe is watching Andy in the library as he is being judged by one of the librarians, it is assumed that Joe can relate because African Americans at the time are also being discriminated against Establishing this parallel between Joe and Andy creates a bridge that leads Joe to taking on Andy's case. During this scene, once again the camera zooms in on Andy and Joe's face There is also diversity shown in the African American community. Joe is homophobic but his wife by contrast is very accepting of homosexual people and encourages Joe to change his ways. Joe is then hit on by a black gay man which sends Joe into a small fit of anger, showing that his homophobia is not going away as easily as it was believed. However, the movie as a whole is pretty diverse in racial terms, and does a great job of depicting prejudices between any race. Overall, Philadelphia is a very moving film that does a good job showing the point that it is trying to portray. Despite minor setbacks such as lack of emotional diversity and predictability, Philadelphia is an interesting insightful movie that is definitely worth watching. The characters are well developed with a strong plot, and is a nice movie for anyone of any race, creed, or sexuality. A must see for all!",Philadelphia
255,zgianelle,"Excellent film, but its representation of the sexuality of gay men is rather bare, and it stereotypifies the sexuality of gay men of color.",7,23 January 2017,"Jonathan Demme's 1993 Philadelphia portrays LGBTQ lives and characteristics as they exist almost exclusively in particularly white and upper- middle-class settings, but his focus on this racial and class faction realistically reflects, with the exception of sexuality, the life and perspective of a gay man living in such a socio-economic faction. To be gay in this film is to be either white and upper- middle-class or perfectly demonized, and the expression of homosexuality through sexual or desirous interaction is almost completely avoided in the film. Throughout the film, we encounter scenes and characters that portray the lives of gays and lesbians in the late 80's, but the films main focus is on the lives of upper- middle- class, white, gay men. Andrew Beckett is our main source of the ""gay perspective,"" but his is limited by his class and race, and most importantly by the film's portrayal of his sexuality. When we first encounter Andy in his own home, it is clear that he associates with other gay, white men, and that he is relatively wealthy. His home is decorated with all kinds of art and the modern design and red color of the interior suggest his luxurious taste. There are very few moments in which Andy even displays intimacy towards his lover, Miguel, while Joe, a straight, black man, expresses his sexuality very openly with his wife in many scenes. Andy's sexuality is relegated to scenes outside of the purview of the film, and they are left for us to imagine, though the scenes in the film hardly allow us to do so. In this way, Tom Hanks rather poorly characterizes the gay man he was playing. He behaves as though he is closeted even when he is alone with his lover, and his sexuality is meant to be taken for granted, not realized or texturized by any realistic expression of desire. The qualities of Andy that we can consider ""gay"" are rather seen in certain stereotypical instances, such as when we see his flamboyantly colorful and artistic apartment and when he becomes lost in his favorite aria, dancing so indulgently that Joe feels uncomfortable and leaves. However, while Andy is not the most sexual gay man, his expressions of emotional affection with Miguel are touching and complicated. The cares and concerns of a gay man having contracted AIDS ware on their relationship in ways that are very clearly expressed by both Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas. At one point, the two men are together in their apartment, and their conversation about Andy's impending death is touching, especially when Tom Hanks fearfully raises the pitch of his voice before deciding to throw a party at their apartment to do something special for Miguel. The emotions of their relationship are also complicated by Andy's apparent rendezvous with a man at the Stallion Theatre while engaging in a relationship with Miguel. They seem to be very fond of each other, but whatever impact Andy's infidelity had on their relationship may explain some of the distance in their sexual life as well as Miguel's somewhat disimpassioned goodbye to Andy at the end.If Andy's sexuality was coded by his love of opera and his flamboyant apartment, Miguel's was coded by his effeminate hysteria that seems to be linked with his Hispanic ethnicity. Miguel seems to be the stereotypical ""hot-blooded Spaniard"" that is only present to be the average, gay, white man's implied object of desire. Whenever they are in the hospital, Miguel is picking fights with all the doctors that are simply telling him the real nature of Andy's medical situation. At one point, he can be heard screaming, ""It's not working!"" to a group of doctors taking care of Andy, even to the point where one of the doctors must escort him out of the room. In his first scene he picks a fight with the doctor who tells him that Andy will need to have a colonoscopy done. Miguel's sexuality is limited in the film by his ethnicity in a way that seems to place him in the ""woman's"" role in his relationship with Andy.Miguel is not the only gay character of color in the film, as Joe is approached by a young black, gay man who wants to have sex with him. But this character is completely demonized in the film, and he represents the worst qualities of promiscuity and cockiness for which gay men, as Joe says, are often criticized by straight people. While there were plenty of other settings in which a gay character might have come onto Joe, this man approaches Joe in a pharmacy in a way that seems both unsolicited and inappropriate. The only good thing that we could say about this black gay character was that he was at least might have been going to the pharmacy to purchase condemns in order to practice safe sex. African American sexuality seems to have been, for both gay and straight black men, far more explicit and open than the sexualities of Andy and Miguel.While this film did well to capture the emotional connections between Andy and Miguel, its representations of sexuality with regard to race and ethnicity were particularly stereotypical and clearly Anglo-centric. Andy's homosexuality comes across as the most tolerable inasmuch as it is strictly coded, but firmly white and ""masculine,"" with the exception of his brief moment of musical ecstasy.",Philadelphia
