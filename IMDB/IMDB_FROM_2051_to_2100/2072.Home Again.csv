0,TheLittleSongbird,Lots of fluff and not much memorability,5,6 October 2017,"Despite liking romantic comedy (there are some good ones out there, as well as some not so good ones) and liking Reese Witherspoon and Michael Sheen in other things, expectations were low for 'Home Again' due to the mixed to negative critical reception and mixed audience reaction.Watching it with an open mind 'Home Again' has its bright spots, enough to make it a one-time watch, and is better than reputed. On the other hand, it also is an uneven film and mostly forgettable fluff. As said, it has good things. Witherspoon, being the lead, was crucial for the film to work, the good news is that, although she has been better in material worthier of her talent, she gives her character and 'Home Again' a very likable energy and very sweet charm. The other acting standout is Sheen, who does bag some very funny (at times hilarious) moments that gives the film much needed levity and gravitas.The best performance of the three young men taken in goes to Jon Rudnitsky, his character is the most interestingly written of the three and he is the most charismatic and easy to like of the three. 'Home Again' is nicely made with a peppy score, while also boasting a good-natured sweet tone, some funny, cheerful moments and a few snappy lines. The children are cute without being overly so.'Home Again' however could have been much better. The film does feel rushed (while there are some scenes too that limp), which would have been solved easily with a longer length (15 minutes more would have made a difference) and trying to do less. It does feel like too much was crammed in and it consequently means that the film lacks depth in particularly how the characters are written. Here they are thinly sketched, one-dimensional and shallow. Humorous and touching moments are too far and between in a film that has very blandly fluffy romantic elements and other comedic elements that feel overplayed.Of the three tyros only Rudnitsky works, whereas the other two struggle to keep up, their characters are too sketchily written, their dialogue is even weaker and they don't have the expertise or charisma here to rise above what they're given. Poor Candice Bergen is wasted with nothing to do, she never gets the chance to show off her charm and spunk. Some snappy moments in the script and sporadic funny and touching moments aside, the script is an over-egged and under-cooked soufflé with its fair share of awkward and cheesy lines and severe underwriting of the characters and their increasingly predictable and vague situations. Some interesting ideas and insights here that could have been delved into more.Story-wise, everything just feels too pat and formulaic, and too much of it doesn't really go anywhere or feel resolved satisfactorily. There is very little to the conflict.All in all, fluffy and not very memorable. Not unwatchable however, there are far worse films out there, of the genre, of the year and ever. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Home Again
1,SnoopyStyle,lackluster trio,5,2 March 2018,"Alice (Reese Witherspoon) is separated with two young daughters. They live in her late filmmaker father's LA home. Her friends take her out for her 40th birthday. Alice meets Harry with his friends George and Teddy. They go back to her house and pass out. Next morning, her mother Lillian (Candice Bergen) unexpectedly shows up with her daughters. The boys are fans of Lillian and her late father. They are amateur filmmakers themselves trying to sell their script. Lillian convinces Alice to invite the boys to stay. Her estranged husband Austen (Michael Sheen) discovers the house guests and promptly returns to stake his claim. A budding romance blooms between her and the 27 year old Harry.The problem here are the three dudes. They lack charisma which leaves their side of the story severely lacking. It doesn't help that the other side has award winning Witherspoon and Sheen. I almost wondered if the three actors are actually the dudes who made this movie. At last no, it's new filmmaker Hallie Meyers-Shyer, daughter of Nancy Meyers. There isn't anything wrong with the script or necessarily anything outrageously right. It is a functional formulaic rom-com premise. It just needs a better male lead to make it work.",Home Again
2,zardoz-13,Yeech!!!,1,24 September 2017,"Just because the parents made several good movies doesn't mean that they passed the 'good movie' gene along to their children. First-time writer-director Hallie Meyers-Shyer is the daughter of Nancy Meyers, who directed ""What Women Want"" (2000), ""Something's Gotta Give"" (2003), ""The Holiday"" (2006), ""It's Complicated"" (2009), and ""The Intern"" (2015). Furthermore, her father, Charles Shyer is best known for ""Irreconcilable Differences"" (1984), ""Baby Boom"" (1987), ""Father of the Bride"" (1991), ""I Love Trouble"" (1994), and ""Father of the Bride, Part II"" (1995). Now, Meyers-Shyer has made her cinematic debut as the director of ""Home Again,"" a sickly-sweet, featherweight, contemporary romantic comedy about love, friendship, and families that comes laden with clichés. Indeed, if you look scrutinize it, you may spot the tale of Goldilocks and the Three Bears lurking in this treacle-flavored, feel-good comedy that would send a Grinch into convulsions. America's sweetheart Reese Witherspoon plays Alice Kenny, a fortysomething mom who uproots her two young daughters from New York City and moves back to her hometown Los Angeles. Alice has grown weary of her stale marriage to her smug, British-born, music mogul husband, Austen (Michael Sheen of ""Passengers""), who has made it a habit of coming home with Jose Cuervo on his breath. Now that she is back in L.A., where her mom, former movie starlet Lillian Stewart (Candice Bergen of ""Soldier Blue"") lives, Alice decides to embark on a free-lance career as an interior home designer. Meantime, her two daughters, Isabel (Lola Flanery of ""Trauma"") and Rosie (Eden Grace Redfield of ""The Glass Castle"") find the transition from East Coast to West Coast a little disconcerting. Truth be told, Alice is feeling a bit blue, too. Among other things, this frivolous potboiler involves a May-December romance between Witherspoon and a far younger Romeo that kindles few sparks as well as some screwball humor about one of our heroine's flaky clients. Ironically, the advertising campaign for ""Home Again"" insists that: ""Starting over is not for beginners."" Comparably, starting up is not for beginners either, considering that Hallie Meyers-Shyer's freshman effort is as inoffensive as it is lukewarm.Mind you, Alice and her daughters have little trouble finding a place to live. They settle into the palatial bungalow where Alice once lived as a child with her late father, John Kenny (David Netto), a renowned director of 1970's era art-house movies. Later, during an alcohol-fueled birthday party at a local restaurant with her girlfriends, Alice runs into three aspiring, twentysomething filmmakers who have just been evicted from their hotel because they cannot pay their rent. You couldn't find a nicer trio of handsome, charming, broke guys like Harry (Pico Alexander of ""War Machine""), Teddy (Nat Wolff of ""Paper Towns""), and their friend George (Jon Rudnitsky of ""Patchwork""), but where did these guys get the money to pay for those drinks? Anyway, the party grows legs, and everybody winds up at Alice's place. Hormone-addled Harry cannot resist making a pass at Alice, and Alice cannot resist the 27-year old stud muffin's confidence. They wallow in some guilt-free sex behind closed doors. The two awaken the following morning without any concerns about indiscretion, and Harry treats Alice like a princess. The night before Alice went out with her girlfriends, she had entrusted Isabel and Rosie to the care and supervision of her mother. Lillian was supposed to take the girls to school. Instead, she brings them over to find everybody recovering from their mild Bacchanalian without any repercussions. It doesn't hurt matters that the guys worship the films of Alice's late father. Moreover, they not only recognize, but they also idolize Lillian, who starred in John Kenny's movies. Lillian revels in their adulation and rustles up breakfast for them while recounting her glory days in Tinseltown. Later, she convinces a reluctant Alice to let these adorable dudes move into the guest-house rent-free until they can get on their feet. As it turns out, Harry, Teddy, and George have just signed with a Hollywood talent agency, and they are struggling to get their short movie produced as a feature length film. It doesn't hurt matters that Harry's brother Teddy knows how to cook, and George becomes Isabel's best friend. Furthermore, George inspires Isabel to write a play for her elementary school about her family. Naturally, Alice's jealous husband learns about this odd arrangement and tears himself away from his business to fly out to Los Angeles so he can reunite with his daughters and perhaps even reconcile with Alice. He is also around to make sure that Alice doesn't make a fool of herself with gallant Harry. Indeed, Alice does make a fool of herself with Harry, before she realizes the error of her ways. Meantime, the guys don't care for Austen any more than he cares for them. Inevitably, this happy house of cards collapses, and Alice explains to Harry that they aren't made for each other. Teddy and Austen clash in the most inoffensive and sloppy fistfight in cinematic history. Naturally, Alice intervenes, and she sends the guys packing, much to Austen's delight. No sooner have they left the premises than Alice lowers the boom on Austen and asks for a divorce. ""Home Again"" is not one of Reese Witherspoon's better efforts. It lacks the sparkle of her better movies, such as ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""Freeway,"" and conjures up none of the wit of her ""Legally Blonde"" chick flicks. Nothing about this breezy but superficial saga is remotely memorable, and it relies primarily on hopeless artifice that amounts to sheer fantasy. Basically, this movie resembles a situation comedy where nobody suffers any consequences for their actions, and everybody kisses and makes up without any lingering ill will to others. Finally, most moviegoers may find it difficult to sympathize with our affluent white protagonist who doesn't have to struggle to assert herself. Ultimately, ""Home Again"" qualifies as 'a comfort food movie' for audiences that prefer to shun anything approaching reality.",Home Again

4,oscaralbert,This horror flick about geriatric Baby Boomer chicks luring young Millennial Lads . . .,6,4 October 2017,". . . into the musty Love Webs they've spun within their Old Folks Homes is enough to give any young student the Heebie Jeebies. Playing like an endless product placement commercial for fighting Middle Age Spread with ""Relaxed Fit"" blue jeans, HOME AGAIN should prove to even the most illiterate young rascal that ""you can't go home again."" Sure, it might seem ""nice"" to go slumming in the Black Widow's web for a few cheap quick tricks, but these fleeting thrills cannot be allowed to outweigh the clear and present dangers of permanent foreign entanglements among the Me Generation. HOME AGAIN's tawdry spectacle of Octopus ""Alice"" clutching at boys young enough to be her grandsons with all eight of her desperately grasping tentacles should prove enough to put even the greenest hetero tenderfoot off his feed. Geezers have been trying to get us to chuckle over ""The Face"" of the kid in HOME ALONE for years. Now they can see ""The Face"" on our own mugs IF they trick us into seeing HOME AGAIN!!",Home Again
5,neil-476,Indifferent Witherspoon project,6,8 May 2018,"Alice is a single mother of independent means (her late father was an acclaimed film director) living in LA with her two daughters. After a drunk birthday celebration, she ends up with three young filmmakers taking up residence in her guest house. She enters into a sexual relationship with Harry, and the girls get on with all 3 young men. Then husband Austen arrives, looking to reconcile. Meanwhile daughter Isabel is looking for reassurance over a school drama project.This is a very slight entry in the rom-com-ish area, characterised by being quite amiable, but not particularly romantic, and not particularly comedic either. Reese Witherspoon and Michael Sheen have both done better and will no doubt do better in the future. Candice Bergen puts in a good-natured but largely unnecessary cameo as Alice's mom, pausing for a couple of one-liners on her way to collect her paycheck. The 3 lads are all fairly forgettable. Lola Flanery makes an impression as Isabel.The one thing I did like about this film is that one gets used to the romcom formula, and that formula dictated that either the Alice/Austen reconciliation would work out, or else the generation difference romance would work out. So kudos to this film for confounding my expectations in that direction.",Home Again
6,ferguson-6,the buddy system,4,6 September 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's just get this out of the way upfront. There is a proved and established market for mindless fluff designed to allow women to laugh at the messes created by ""real life"" relationships, careers, and parenting. In fact, first time writer-director Hallie Meyers-Shyer is merely continuing the traditions set by her bloodline. She is the daughter of filmmakers Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer who shared an Oscar screen writing nomination for PRIVATE BENJAMIN (1980), and collaborated on other Romantic-Comedies such as FATHER OF THE BRIDE (I and II), and BABY BOOM (1987). Rom- Coms exist to bring some balance to the universe of Comic Book film adaptations for fan boys. It is possible to have quality filmmaking on both sides  no matter how rare it seems.Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon stars as Alice Kinney. It's her 40th birthday, and she's a chipper lady recently separated from her music industry husband (Michael Sheen) and moved with their two daughters (Lola Flanery, Eden Grace Redfield) from New York to Los Angeles. Alice is in full ""starting over"" mode, including kicking off a new home decorating business. During a drunken birthday celebration with her friends, Alice hooks up with a younger man. The next morning, Alice's mom (Candice Bergen) invites Harry (the young man played by Pico Anderson) and his two buddies (Nat Wolff, Jon Rudnitsky - all 3 are budding filmmakers) to move into Alice's house. What follows is a maybe/maybe not romance between Harry and Alice, a bonding between the fellows and Alice's daughters, new business struggles for Alice, the sudden return to the scene of Alice's husband, and an endless stream of movie-making meetings for the 3 guys.That's a recap of the story, but it doesn't address the real issue. For years, we have been hearing that the good-old-boy Hollywood network needed to back more female-centric projects: movies about women, movies directed by women, movies written by women, movies produced by women. Well this one has ALL of that, and yet I can only imagine the outrage if a man had written/directed/produced this exact film. Let's discuss.Alice is positioned as a ""brave"" and ""strong"" woman for moving her kids across the country and starting over. What allows this woman to be so courageous? Well see, she is the daughter of a deceased filmmaker who had a successful career and left her a multi-million dollar California estate  conveniently, one with a guest house for the three young men to live in. And who in their right mind, and with two young daughters, would invite three total strangers to move in – especially the night after - even if one of them looks to be yanked right out of an Abercrombie ad? There is also Alice's interaction with her first client (played by Lake Bell). Despite despicable treatment from the rich lady, Alice doesn't stand her ground until yet another drunken bout of liquid courage occurs. The two daughters are smart and cute, but there is an obvious shortage of daily parenting happening here – the daughters seem to show up only when a dose of precociousness is required. The scenes with Alice and her estranged husband are appropriately awkward, but the communication seems hokey  at least until we witness true hokeyness in the cartoonish exchanges between the (now) four gentlemen. In fact, all male characters are written as cartoons, which we might view as ""getting even"" with the many times female characters were poorly written; however, since the female lead here is just as unreal, that theory doesn't hold. The paint-by-numbers approach carries through as we check all the boxes: cute kids, a pet dog, apologetic ex, hunky new suitor, no financial hardships, loads of delightful dialogue, Ms. Witherspoon flashing more facial contortions than Jim Carrey at his peak, at least two cheesy musical montages, a mad dash to the kid's play/recital/game, and even the cherry on top  a Carole King song at the end. In a year with so many wonderful female-centric films, this one is difficult to comprehend – except that maybe, given who her parents are, perhaps Ms. Meyers-Shyer is actually the beneficiary of that good old boy network of which we've heard tell.",Home Again
7,morrison-dylan-fan,Home Alone.,6,4 October 2017,"After getting a check-up at the dentist (which I passed with flying colours!) I felt like seeing a short & sweet flick. Finding her Legally Blonde movies to be charmers,I got set to see Reese Witherspoon go home again. The plot:Separated from her husband, Alice Kinney (whose dad was a film maker) tries to balances work and raising her two kids. On a night out, Kinney meets budding film makers George,Harry and Teddy on a night out,who she invites round her place. The next day the guys reveal they have nowhere to stay,which leads to Kinney letting them stay at her place and starting a romance with Harry,that gets interrupted by her husband unexpectedly coming home again.View on the film:Joined by the easy-going trio of Nat Wolff/Pico Alexander and Jon Rudnitsky as Harry,Teddy and George, Michael Sheen gives the fluffy tale a touch of gravitas as Kinney's worn-down husband Austen. Carrying the breezy mood of the movie, Reese Witherspoon gives a sweet performance as Kinney,with Witherspoon giving Kinney a strong self-belief,and an ease with lightly comedic one-liners. Running at least 30 mins shorter than the Rom-Com epics her mum usually makes,debuting writer/director Hallie Meyers-Shyer brings out some interesting twists on the Rom-Com,from everyone being budding film makers,to Kinney's toy-boy romance,and the surprisingly romance-free ending. Whilst shot in a slick Rom-Com style by Shyer & cinematographer Dean Cundey,the screenplay by Shyer oddly decides to leave out any hint of conflict in the romance,as any disagreement or romantic feelings anyone has is pushed away just five minutes later, as Kinney goes home again.",Home Again
8,phd_travel,Unsympathetic characters but the houses are nice,2,30 November 2017,Good points: The houses are pretty. That's about itBad points:The central character is unsympathetic. She gets so upset that a guy misses a dinner with her because he is trying to get financing for his movie. She should understand how hard it is to succeed in the industry and understand that. Sounds like an entitled immature me me me person.The relationship has no chemistry. Pico Alexander looks a too young for Reese - it's a tad predatory looking. He looks younger than an average 27 year old because he's slim. What happened to Michael Sheen? Usually British actors don't get out of shape.Not much a of a conclusion. What did you get out of watching this movie? Very little. The story is just too weak.,Home Again
9,gradyharp,A RomCom that stays light and airy,8,24 December 2017,"Writer/director Hallie Meyers-Shyer (What Women Want, The Parent Trap, It's Complicated) serves us a delectable light treat for the holiday season in this well written and well-acted little piece of pastiche. The reason the film works so well is in addition to a nice light touch in writing and directing it is delivered by a strong cast of both well-known actors and some very exciting newcomers.Alice (Reese Witherspoon), a recently separated mother of two daughters (Lola Flanery, Eden Grace Redfield) has moved from New York to Los Angeles to find a vocation and an escape form a bumpy marriage. She finds her life upended when three young, charismatic filmmakers (Pico Alexander, Jon Rudnitsky and Nat Wolff) move into her guesthouse at the encouragement of her ex-actress mother (Candice Bergen). But her unlikely new family and a budding romance come to a crashing halt when her ex-husband (Michael Sheen) shows up, suitcase in hand. And as the synopsis states, ' A story of love, friendship, the families we create, Home Again is a modern romantic comedy with one very big life lesson: starting over is not for beginners!'Reese Witherspoon is wholly convincing as the central figure undergoing transition from a discontent marriage to a life when she feels free. The three young men are very well cast and offer a sense of credibility to what could be a rather silly idea. In all, it works - and makes for a light evening's entertainment - with a heart.",Home Again
10,inkblot11,"Sweet and mildly funny; great cast but not a must-see, unhappily; those who love romantic comedy will embrace it",6,9 September 2017,"Alice (Reese Witherspoon) is a the only daughter of a famous, philandering screenwriter and director. Her divorced mother, Lillian (Candice Bergen), once an actress, lives in California when Alice decides to move her newly split family to the same place. And, oh, what a place! Alice has inherited the beautiful home of her father, complete with a lush lawn, gardens and a summer house. Leaving behind their workaholic father, Austen (Michael Sheen), young daughters Isabel and Rosie are not sure they like going to new schools. The unspoken reason for the move is to decide on a divorce for the Mom and Dad. Meanwhile, Alice will concentrate on her new career in interior design. In the same city, a trio of young filmmakers, actor Teddy (Nat Wolff), writer George (Jon Rudnitsky) and director Harry (Pico Alexander) are struggling. Kicked out of their cheap apartment while awaiting news on their film projects, they run to the bar. Alice is there, with friends, celebrating her 40th birthday. All get very tipsy, while Alice and Harry lock lips. Somehow, everyone ends up back at Alice's. During intense hangovers and aghast, Lillian shows up with her granddaughters. The ""guys"" recognize Lillian as a former star and they all have a nice chat. It is THEN Lil invites them all to board in Alice's summer house while working on their next paychecks. Although NOTHING HAPPENED between them, Alice is scared about being so close to handsome Harry. But, she lets them stay. Soon the fellows are helping out with Alice's business and the girls with their problems. Love may be in the air. But, ho ho, soon Austen shows up! What possible brouhaha is brewing? This sweet film, mildly funny, will please romantic comedy fans. It will especially enchant those with who love decorating shows as Alice's home is a lovely place with great decor and charm. But, alas, although the cast is great, especially the beautiful Witherspoon, and works overtime, the film lags from time to time. Therefore, its not a must-see, unhappily.

12,vincentlynch-moonoi,Bravo for something different!,7,17 November 2021,"Once 100 people have reviewed a film, I usually don't. But I'm making an exception this time because I have a very different take on this film.As I skim the offerings of Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Max, I get so tired of all the violent films, inane comedies, and pure fantasy films (including horror and science fiction). I'm not saying those genres shouldn't be made. But frankly, they're a dime a dozen. So I found this film to be a refreshing change of pace. It's about pretty good people doing the best they can in an odd situation. Perhaps too odd to be real, but intriguing, none the less.I didn't know anything about the film, but hadn't watched anything with Reese Witherspoon in a very long time, so I thought I'd sort of catch up with her. And I'm glad I did. The acting here is mostly very good. I wasn't as impressed with Jon Rudnitsky...he way 'okay'. Pico Alexander was interesting. I thought Nat Wolff showed promise. And it was good to see Candice Bergen.As far as the plot, I thought it was...well 'charming' is not quite the right word...but close enough. Logical? Not so much...but hey, most of what we watch isn't very logical. Or maybe this is just one of those films where we're asked to see that family is more than just relatives.",Home Again
13,tabuno,A Refreshing Contemporary Return to Light but Substantive Family Fare,8,9 January 2019,"10 September 2017. Immediately the female audience is presented with a light comedy drama from the very start. In the vein of the light and breezy You Got Mail (1998) or Sabrina (1954), Reese Witherspoon headlines this after coming of age entertainment vehicle that delights, feels good, and at the same time offers up some real reflective emotional moments. Home Again depicts the real life dilemma facing many older women whose flaky, immature husbands are trying to find some balance between work and family, sometimes quite poorly. Today's women are faced with more options but also more difficult choices while maintaining important responsibilities. While the movie avoids the most difficult of answers or ultimate responses by the end of the movie, it doesn't have to, it has offered up enough important questions and possible consequences to let the audience members make up their mind as what direction the movie may take. With a great romantic musical sound track that scores with the various moments in the various movie scenes along with decent acting, it is the sensitive script with a nice sense of embarrassing humor that allows the difficult relational awkwardness in the present to be absorbed with sparkling appeal by the audience. A great movie for its more narrower target audience who have the wisdom and older experience to appreciate the important elements of responsible happiness.",Home Again

So basically this film is for her to watch. But the three young actors too was not bad. The story was better, especially how it all ended. This is for the gown ups, above 25-30 years old people. Because of how everything revolved, only they can understand it better.

This is a romantic comedy that is not great but it's alright, for what it is. My wife seemed to like it more than I did. It's written and directed by Hallie Meyers-Shyer, a first time director, but her mother is Nancy Meyers, who directed The Intern, It's Complicated and What Women Want, so it must be something in the genes. Reese plays a 40 year old mother of two daughters, that is separated from Michael, a workaholic that just doesn't appreciate his family. They live in New York, so Reese decides to move back to Los Angeles, where she grew up. Candice plays her mother. Reese meets 3 guys in their 20's, that are trying to make it in Hollywood-one is a writer, one a director and one is an actor. Pico is one of the young men that falls for Reese and things get more complicated-besides their age difference-when Michael decides that he wants Reese and his family back. It is a little different in that Reese is trying to establish her own life, without having to depend on a man being there to support her. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes. Like I said earlier, it's not bad for a first time director, but it's not one that I would buy on DVD.

22,davispittman,Entertaining light fare,8,11 September 2017,"Home Again is the new Nancy Meyers produced Reese Witherspoon movie. It centers around Witherspoon's character, Alice. Alice is a single mother with two daughters who has separated from her husband and has moved back to California. She invites three young struggling male filmmakers to stay in her guesthouse, since they, at that time, have nowhere else to go. Alice gets romantically involved with one of those three men and then things get a bit complicated. Also, her husband she is separated from decides to pay a visit and things get even more complicated. I absolutely adore Nancy Meyers! She is one of the best in the industry in my opinion. So, I thought it was a pretty safe bet to say that I was going to have a positive reaction to this movie. Turns out, that was a safe bet, because I enjoyed home again very much. If you like romantic comedies, you'll love it. If you like sentimental dramas, then you will definitely enjoy it. And if you like the stars, then there's a good chance you'll like it too. The writing is good and the dialogue is very well written, this movie is all about the characters, and the writing enhances the connections between them. 8/10 for Home Again, it's a worthwhile sweet movie to enjoy if you're in the right mood for this kind of film.",Home Again
23,Amari-Sali,Home Again foregoes most of the drama you are used to and uses its one peculiar moment to show how much of a blessing fate can sometimes be.,8,17 September 2017,"HighlightsThe Complicated RomanceThere is a bit of a love triangle between Harry, Alice, and Austen. One in which, even when Austen is being petty, there is some difficulty in taking sides. On one hand, Harry is this young guy with all this charm and sort of helps Alice get her groove back. He sort of disrupts her life and reminds her what romance is. Maybe even passion.Yet, on the other hand, Austen is a charmer too. His main fault though is he has a history with Alice. He, like Harry, sometimes put his work before her and it led to her, and the girls, in the case of Austen, perhaps not feeling valued. Something we get to see quickly played out through Harry missing a dinner and it really helping to drive that, at this point in Alice's life, while she wants stability, she also wants that passion she had in her 20s too. Making the decision between the man she knows and this boy who is on his way difficult. Especially since the decision can affect her children.The FriendshipsWhile by no means do we see Alice fall apart, we are reminded by Harry that we are mostly seeing her at her best. At the beginning of Home Again we do see her having a bit of a meltdown, but we are reminded she is a single parent raising two young girls. Two girls who only really have her, and their grandmother part time, and there is this need to set an example. All the while, trying to give them the type of joys her father gave to her.Yet, Alice isn't super mom. So with George and Terry, we see them pick up the slack in the child rearing department. Terry in the form of watching over Rosie and, when Austen comes around, sort of being a red flag in terms of Austen's intentions. Then with George, we see him bond with Isabel in such a beautiful way. For, you see, Harry, Terry, and George are in pursuit of making films. Harry is the director, Terry the actor, and George the writer. So with Isabel being a bit introverted, yet with talent, he fosters her in a way. Thus allowing us to see this child bloom because this man, unlike her dad, sticks to his word and actually is there when she needs him.All of which you'd think may look or seem forced. However, the guys come into Alice's household like Mary Poppins and truly come off as a god send. Thus creating quite a few touching, and heartfelt, moments. Well, alongside some comedic ones since Austen doesn't like any of them and Terry is the most vocal, and physical, about his distaste for Austen.CriticismAlice's Professional LifeThe way it sounds, Alice has probably used her privilege, thanks to her father and mother's money and prestige, to spend most of her life finding herself. With that, it isn't clear what she does but try things out until she realizes she isn't good at it. Though, now at 40, it seems like it has clicked that she is good at interior design. Sadly, though, her first client is Zoey (Lake Bell) and that whole subplot is weird and I think the intention was supposed to be comical, but it flops in the pursuit.On The FenceThe Forgone FatherAlice's father is talked about for a good 5 or more minutes at the beginning of the movie, and his presence sort of lingers. George is a huge fan and when he sees the memorabilia, he freaks out. Lillian convinces Alice to have these three strangers in her guest house by noting how her ex-husband, who cheated on her, would have loved them. Then there comes the question of this other child he fathered and at times, it really makes you wish this man was alive.Yet, in some ways he is. Between Austen and Harry, and that extended background we get about Alice's dad, you get the idea that Alice falls for men who kind of remind her of her dad. Be it his charm, charisma, him not being the most dependable of people, it is something she is attracted to. Making it where, even though we don't truly get to meet Alice's dad, you do feel like, through those two men, you vicariously did.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing)Do I necessarily think you need to see Home Again immediately, like this weekend? No. Is this even a notable film for any of the actors' filmographies? Absolutely not. However, what you get here is that rare mix of a film which doesn't try to dramatize a situation yet doesn't necessarily come off boring. For what it tries to do is really explore the importance of relationships and illustrate how each one affects the ones we have thereafter. It is perhaps one of the few films which, in my mind, practices trying to be subtle but doesn't lose your interest in the process.Hence the positive label. For while I think of Home Again as one of the films you need to watch multiple times, I do hope some writer sees what was done here and improves based on the example. For the Home Again was touching, without being Lifetime cheesy. Dramatic, but not to the point of being eye roll inducing, and really seemed to want to focus on one weird situation which may be something you'd only see in the movies. Yet, somehow, Home Again finds a way to almost trick you into thinking, if fate would have it, situations like this could happen in your life.",Home Again
24,rgkarim,"Fun, Family, and Friends Make It Feel Like Home",6,9 September 2017,"Not in the mood for scares this weekend? No problem, Hollywood has got you non-horror movie goers covered with another romantic comedy. This weekend, the legendary Reese Witherspoon stars in another Hallie Meyers-Shyer work, in hopes of tickling your romantic fantasy on a less risqué scale. Robbie K back again with another movie review on Home Again. Will this film be another mundane addition to her lineup, or do we perhaps have something special with this flick? Let's get started to answer that question, shall we?LIKES:Charming/Cute: Like her works in the past, Meyers-Shyer has done a fantastic job building an adorable world/situation for our characters to play in. No major tension, violence, or heart- stopping shock moments, exist in this movie. Instead it is just a simple tale that will pull at your heartstrings while portraying those romantic morals many wish to see. Such a positive atmosphere certainly offsets the horror atmosphere of the other movie most likely to be in your theater. Fun: With that positive atmosphere comes a fun movie, filled with small sequences that are wholesome, innocent, and surprisingly entertaining. Like a Hallmark Movie on steroids, Home Again takes on plenty of life lessons that are tested against the modern society trends today. Loyalty, romance, job work, responsibility, and child rearing are just some of the things you'll get in this movie. And while tasteful, and certainly predictable, the journey to addressing the obstructions in our character's life brings about some simplistic laughs, a plethora of smiles, and a few tears for whose hearts are warmed by Meyer-Shyer's writing. Acting: Despite what some say, I found the acting okay and well-fitting given the environment of the movie. Witherspoon herself felt very natural in the role of a single mom looking to find herself again. She brought great energy to the film, all while keeping herself grounded amidst the chaos of all the relationships. The kids were an adorable addition, each playing their parts well to offset the romantic drama loaded into this film. I particular liked the older daughter story and how it integrated a different side of the guys to help solve a different problem. Speaking of the guys all three ""eligible"" bachelors were decent in playing their assigned roles, from younger brother bringing peace, to the stud that caught Reese's eyes. Of all them, Jon Rudnitsky was my favorite and the most dynamic of the characters being integrated into the film. A nice blend of comedy and drama, Jon's character kept the characters well integrated into the mix. The short run time: A predictable tale like this can get old, fast. Fortunately, they had the foresight to cut this movie to the shorter end, telling the tale in enough details to get the job done. A plus on my side, though many may feel robbed of a full story they pine for given her past films. DISLIKES:Rushed elements: Despite the short time being a nice gift, Home Again's brisk pace leaves some key development scrounging for a rebound. So much potential to really give more layers to the movie, and perhaps get a few engaging story lines out of the mix would have been the better route. Especially when it came to the challenges at hand. No major obstacle: Home Again felt like a movie with little struggle, few challenges, and in all honesty a lackluster tale all in all. It played a little too close to home and left me just milling about as the problems seemed to iron themselves away. With all the complicated relationships crammed into this tale, one would expect a little more resistance from the awkward shuffling this cast played. Even most Hallmark movies push back more than this film did before they get to that mushy-gushy ending that millions fall in love with. Perhaps a larger challenge might have made for more engaging characters and a feeling of accomplishment. Characters: Sure they are charming, cute, admirable, and responsible in many ways, but I have to face the facts the characters are rather one dimensional. The actors did well with what they were given, but much of the movie's puppets were a bit boring to me. Much of my fellow audience members like their physical appearances the most, but this reviewer had difficulties attaching to them because of their stunted growth. Even Reese's character seemed a bit dull, caught in a whirlwind of indecision before suddenly flipping sides. Even worse, the characters (like the plot) were predictable, further dulling the film's entertainment value. Little Candice Bergen: When you sell Murphy Brown in the trailers, I hope to get more of the spunky actress. Not the case, as Bergen is reduced to a few nugget lines of dialog that is lost in the ""romantic"" tide. Had she been integrated into the movie, I have no doubt the characters could have grown stronger with her pushing Reese's character to better herself. The VERDICT: While certainly cute, Home Again was a bit too simplistic for my tastes, missing the potential to be one of the better romantic comedies. A rushed story with limited character growth, no real obstacles to keep you engaged, and some missed comedic elements doesn't bode well for this predictable tale. However, it is still a fun, feel good movie that will do its job of entertaining target audiences with eye candy, simplistic laughs, and an overall warm your cardiac pump moment that will make you feel good at the end of the day. Not a bad feeling, but not worth the inflated movie ticket price. My scores:Comedy/Drama/Romance: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.5",Home Again
25,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Home Again,6,13 September 2017,"""Home again, home again, jiggety-jig"". Oops, wrong movie. I'm just talking about Home Again, the 2017 vehicle starring the justly adorable, Reese Witherspoon. In truth, if you like a romantic farce mixed with the ins and outs of making it in Hollyweird, then ""Again"" is the flick for you. Home Again's blithe story is as follows: Witherspoon stars as Alice Kinney. She's a 40-year-old mother of two and has been recently separated from her record producer husband (Austen played by Michael Sheen). Kinney, the daughter of a famous movie director, moves back to Los Angeles to live in her father's old house. One night, Alice goes out on the town and ends up partying with three aspiring filmmakers who are much younger than her. They all stagger back to her abode and she reluctantly plays the cougar role. She hooks up with one of them in 27-year-old Harry (played by Pico Alexander). All three gents find themselves living with Alice because they are broke and are waiting for their big, Hollywood break. So OK, I'm not gonna beat around the bush. Home Again feels like a been there, done that version of Something's Gotta Give. You could also throw in elements of 2009's It's Complicated. It all makes sense. ""Again's"" helm-er is Hallie Meyers-Shyer and she is the daughter of Nancy Meyers. Nancy as most of you know, is responsible for Something's Gotta Give and that was a big box office hit. Meyers-Shyer is an admirable director but heck, she doesn't want to be her own person here. She'd rather emulate her mother who happens to be one of Home Again's multiple producers. The result is a sort of lightweight, situation comedy whose screenplay doesn't always ring true. I mean, is Michael Sheen's estranged husband really that bad of a guy? And does Pico Alexander's Harry really deserve to be put out by Alice just because he missed one supper date? At times, ""Again's"" pseudo love story kind of comes to fruition. During other times, it feels a little unfinished and hoax-like. Take for instance Home Again's cutesy ending. It left me teetering on the edge of something. Of what I'm not quite sure. Now Home Again and Something's Gotta Give have the same background music and the same happy happy stature. Basically, they are the cinematic equivalent of nurtured buttermilk. Both films also have scenes where people are always smiling, always laughing, and always having relaxing family dinners. I mean even when a character gets punched in the face (towards ""Again's"" third act), there's still a sense that everything is gonna be okay. In conclusion, Something's Gotta Give excels in its emotional sequences between Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. Home Again doesn't quite reach that feat. Reese Witherspoon sort of resembles the Keaton trouper but she is not given enough script material to shine. Remember when Diane Keaton got nominated for an Oscar with ""Give""? Well Witherspoon is definitely not gonna get to that plateau this time around. Bottom line: There are some feel- good moments within ""Again"" but it's still a two and a half star rating for me.",Home Again
26,bkrauser-81-311064,Fluffy and Forgettable,7,7 September 2017,"Home Again is one of those movies that's easy to like and easy to forget. It's amateurish, the characters are flat and one-dimensional and the story is practically a celebration in vapidity and contrivance. Despite this, there's not a mean bone in Home Again's body. There's lightness to it. It's boring but charming in much the same way the interior of a Pier 1 is.Reese Witherspoon stars as Alice Kinney, a recently separated mother of two who has returned to her childhood home in California to start over. Her mother (Bergen) and deceased father were once considered Hollywood royalty; a fact that three young potential filmmakers (Wolff, Alexander, Rudnitsky) go positively gaga for when they meet her at a bar celebrating her 40th birthday. Blah, blah, blah the three end up moving into the guest house. The estranged husband (Sheen) shows up later making four and Reese Witherspoon tries to cobble together a life amid the chaos.Did I say chaos, I meant unrealistically utopian equilibrium. Alice and her brother-husbands seem to have little scruples about living in a house together. This is in large part because they don't display any of the negative attributes of a regular human being. Stubbornness becomes selflessness and possessiveness is painted like enamored school boy crushes. Most of the external conflicts exist despite the setup and all the internal conflicts have the undemanding clarity of a children's storybook. To top it all off we're given the comparable setting of a 30's screwball comedy, vis a vis an expansive Hollywood villa, ensuring that the prime demographic will finally have a respite from the grave, emotionally challenging story arcs of The Gilmore Girls (2000-2007).The movie takes its reverse Three's Company (1976-1984) setup exactly where you think it's going to go. At one point one of Alice's friend's muses that she has 24-hour childcare, tech support and sex all under one roof. Because the children are around, the dynamic stays as pallid and PG as it can, with focus being constantly siphoned off into unnecessary subplots. These subplots provide the few moments of character development for the three boys, but once they're living and interacting in Alice's quaint Spanish style abode, it becomes clear that the main reason for them being in this movie is to be a plot device.This is where, if you read way too much into it like I did, you get to the good stuff. If viewed through a specific lens, Home Again could be seen as an examination of modern gender relations. At 40, Alice struggles with never truly finding the complete package – a handsome man who can exhibit maturity, meet obligations, provide economic stability, and healthy emotional growth for her and her children while seeing Alice as an equal. This point is further highlighted by the fact that she idolizes her father despite him not exactly being a prize either. So instead of compromising she compartmentalizes. She fits the guys in this film into boxes of positive traits and for the most part, they fit them, at least until the plot deems this equilibrium is no longer stable.Obviously this line of thought coaxes a lot of interesting questions about masculinity, femininity and modern relationships. But using this movie as a starting point for such a discussion is like reading Tarot through McDonalds Monopoly tokens. This movie isn't Antonia's Line (1995) it's Sweet Home Alabama (2002); which is to say a fluffy and forgettable piece of popular entertainment.That said Home Again is not all that unpleasant to sit through, in large part because Witherspoon knows exactly how to move sugary confections like this. She proves effortlessly charming and despite some bad editing and awkward staging, Home Again glides on the power of her gossamer wings to give us a moderately entertaining distraction. See it if you must.",Home Again

31,rockman182,Home Again (2017),6,11 September 2017,"At first I thought this was a sequel to You Again, but then I realized that film didn't have Reese Witherspoon in it. January and September are historically the months after heavy box office intake and thus usually have films shoved into a release because studio's couldn't figure out what to do with them. This month seems a little different with the release of It and Mother! Home Again however, has the feel of that September release. It turns out to be a rather forgettable ordeal.The film is about a 40 something mom of two who decides to house three young filmmakers. They are aspiring to get on their feet and along the way bond with the family who takes them in. Alice Kinney (played by Reese Witherspoon) also starts a relationship with one of the young filmmakers. This is essentially the plot as there really isn't that much more conflict in the film.I do like Reese and think she can pull off a cheery spunky role to perfection. She's had a pretty good career with a few very fine roles. She is easily the best part of the film. The biggest let down here is a script that feels so underutilized. The jokes never really hit home and the film feels quite inconsequential. Its hard to give an afterthought to a film that doesn't really offer any originality or that doesn't dare to impress. Its a forgotten affair as soon as you finish.I will say though that the film is completely harmless. Its a little overly sweet but I guess it works as a decent date movie. I guess its hard to really complain, For one, the expectations for this are minimal. Two, you have to expect the other film that's competing with the juggernaut that is It to not be as satisfying  a viewing. I'll still watch Reese in whatever she does, at least.6/10",Home Again
32,jon.h.ochiai,"Sweet ""Home Again""",8,10 September 2017,"""Home Again"" is predictable, flawed at times, yet genuinely sweet. Writer and Director Haillie Meyers-Shyer, daughter of renowned romantic comedy Director Nancy Meyers, who also produced, starts ""Home Again"" unevenly, then finds her heartfelt way. The movie is about how love creates the unique kind of family. ""Home Again"" stars Reese Witherspoon as spunky divorced Mom Alice Kinney caring for her daughters, 11 year-old Isabel, played by Lola Flaney, and her younger sister Rosie, played Eden Grace Redfield. Her estranged husband is subversively selfish record producer Austen, played by charming Michael Sheen. Alice moves back to her famous movie director Father John Kinney's home in Los Angeles, from New York. Her wise free- spirited Mother Lillian, played with comic gravitas by Candice Bergen, only wants Alice to be happy. The possibility emerges under contrived circumstance, when three young wannabe film- makers become welcome house guests and caring babysitters of Alice. Handsome passionate Pico Alexander plays short film director Harry. Compassionate and whimsical Reid Scott plays writer Justin, who even more than his other buddies is the distinctive fan of Alice's father John. Funny and level headed Nat Wolf is the surprise as actor Teddy, whose courage arises in the face of Austen's deception. Predictably, Harry and Alice attract, and have the affair creating the inevitable drama. As ""Home Again"" opens Alice drives Isabel and Rosie to their first day at their new school. In a stilted exchange Isabel regurgitates her presumed depression symptoms from a Zoloft commercial. Yikes. Fortunately, Meyers-Shyer discovers her touching way and narrative voice. I think ""Home Again"" moves in its quieter moments, surrendering to its humanity. Ultimately, ""Home Again"" defines this new family distinct from our perception of the real world one. After all this is a movie. Good people, good family give us faith to believe in the good in others, and to believe in ourselves.In the disheartening scene Riley suffers when Harry is a no show at the dinner party with her friends. Harry foregoes the dinner to schmooze with potential producers and financiers of his, Teddy, and Justin's movie dream. Reese is understated sadness, vulnerable, and calm. She confronts Harry the next morning. Her 40 year-old Alice has really no time for an irresponsible 27 year-old charmer, who doesn't distinguish what matters. The man she wants and needs is honor and compassion. Alexander as Harry is brilliant humility as the kid, realizing that he really needs to man up. No kidding. ""Home Again"" works its subtle spell in the quieter moments. We experience great joy as the Boys create the driven-in style dinner at the home as they all watch John Kinney's Oscar winning movie on projector film. Writer Justin is childlike wonder reading through the memorabilia of Alice's famous father, his hero. Meyers-Shyer hint in Witherspoon's Alice, the reborn love for her estranged late Father, seeing what happiness her father gave Harry, Justin, and Teddy. Perhaps, she will forgive and allow for her father's frailty. Innocent and timid Flaney as Isabel finds her older ""soul' brother Justin. Isabel wrote a play for school. She requests Justin be back stage with her when she performs as she and Justin drive to school. As often as ""Home Again"" succumbs to clumsy, it returns and touches your heart. In the poignant narrative arc, having heard enough from their candidate big deal movie producer regarding their film, Harry says, ""We're leaving. We have to see an 11 year-old in a school play."" ""Home Again"" gets it right. Family is what works, not what is supposed to be. The good people, the people who love you, make you believe in the good, and make you believe in yourself. I really liked ""Home Again"". I think it's a lot like people. No one is perfect. Love is about giving your very best.",Home Again
33,Quietb-1,Pleasant enough.,6,17 September 2017,Reece Witherspoon carries this romantic comedy on her shoulders. It is harmless fluff and entertaining enough. Ignore things like how did the Witherspoon character know where the guys moved and showed up in their place. What was the flower set up with no vase payoff. Then there was the movie in the yard with half the film on the take up reel at the start of the credits. Why was so much emphasis placed on the ex moving to Los Angeles?The movie is a perfect example of a sit back and enjoy your popcorn experience. There is really no reason to see this in a theater as it will play well on home platforms. If you don't expect too much you won't be disappointed.,Home Again
34,dave-mcclain,"""Home Again"" is a clichéd, unrealistic fantasy of a rom-com.",1,9 September 2017,"Have you ever been to a high school play? Those kids and their director work on it for a long time and they try really hard, but no matter what they do, no high school play is going to compete for a Tony Award – or have Hollywood studios clamoring to make the play into a movie with The Original Cast. If you're in the audience, you may enjoy some moments of the play, but you'll often get distracted by what's wrong with it. You'll surely notice some of the actors are more talented than others. There will probably be a really pretty girl who seems to be in a lot of plays and may even win some awards and she'll be acting opposite a slightly older guy with fake gray in his hair, but they'll be acting alongside guys and girls who don't quite manage to get genuine emotion into their performances. And then there's the story. Whether the script is good or not, in the hands of a bunch of high school students and a director, who is probably fairly young and may be just starting out, the play's action comes off as unrealistic and may make you roll your eyes a few times or even laugh at the production (not laugh with it – laugh AT it). Well, you may have a similar set of experiences watching the rom-com ""Home Again"" (PG-13, 1:37).Alice Kinney (Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon) has come home. (She's already there when the movie begins, with no drama leading up to the actual homecoming as the movie's title seems to be implying.) She has moved from New York City, back to L.A. into the home of her late film director father and back in close contact with her former actress mother, Lillian Stewart (Golden Globe and Emmy winner and Oscar nominee Candice Bergen). Alice has brought her two daughters, insecure young teen Isabel (Lola Flanery) and the precocious little Rosie (Eden Grace Redfield), but Alice has left behind her music manager husband, Austen (Golden Globe nominee Michael Sheen). She considers herself separated from Austen and has decided to start another new career where she grew up. She freely admits that she was bad at photography and her other previous ventures, but now she thinks she can be an interior designer. She isn't hurting for money, but trying a new profession is part of trying to figure out her life.Alice goes out with her old friends to celebrate her 40th birthday and makes some new friends – some very young new friends who become very good friends. Alice's birthday celebration merges with the night out of three aspiring filmmakers who are celebrating getting a meeting with a producer who is interested in making their acclaimed short film into a feature. This trio of 20-somethings includes the tall, suave and handsome Harry (Pico Alexander), who is the director (and the group's leader), the hard-working screenwriter George (Jon Rudnitsky) and Harry's sensitive younger brother, Teddy (Nat Wolff), the actor. The party ends up back at Alice's where everyone passes out. The next morning, Lillian shows up with the girls after spending the night together, the guys are star struck and everyone bonds over breakfast. Lillian finds out that the guys just lost their apartment and suggests that Alice let them stay in her guesthouse. She's hesitant, but agrees. Before long, Alice strikes up a romance with Harry, George mentors Isabel in her school drama activities and Austen shows that he's not so sure his marriage to Alice is really over.""Home Again"" is a clichéd, unrealistic fantasy. Everything simply happens too easily for these characters and the plot resolutions that eventually arrive are not well-earned, dramatically speaking. Not only does the script indulge about every rom-com cliché in movie history, but it has the actors do and say things that just don't ring true, making it feel more like a fantasy film than a romantic comedy. Writer-director Hallie Meyers-Shyer (daughter of successful filmmaker Nancy Meyers) can be forgiven to an extent, this being her first film as writer or director, but having an Oscar winner say lines like, ""I know this, because I know this,"" is simply unworthy of a major motion picture. Besides, the experienced cast members should've known better, while the younger cast should've done better (or been cast better). Most of the performances lack emotional depth and most of the relationships portrayed lack cinematic chemistry. On the positive side, this film has a bland sweetness about it, there are moments of muted joy and the set-up is fairly creative, but the setting isn't relatable to most Movie Fans and it's hard to imagine anyone considering this a quality film. As for Meyers-Shyer, she was still in her 20s when she wrote and shot this movie. Hopefully, her follow-up efforts will show some professional growth. If not, I'm sure there's a high school somewhere that could use a drama director. As for Movie Fans who go to the trouble to go out and see this movie, afterwards, you'll be happy just to be Home Again. ""D+""",Home Again
35,MihaiSorinToma,A boring series of events,5,25 January 2019,"A woman who just reached the 40 years mark seems to be in a mid-life crisis. Having two children who need all the attention they can get and a husband who lives in another city due to his work, she is genuinely sad and almost depressed by her situation. Things are about to change though after she meets three young men who are seeking a career in cinematography as a team. Their lives seem to intertwine, especially as she agrees to provide them a place to stay while they sort things out for their future, but not only that.It's a movie with quite a generic premise which presents Reese Witherspoon's character as she faces the less likeable part of her age, especially as she has to do it all on her own. We follow the events that follow her 40th anniversary, where she meets three promising guys who are about to bring something new into her life. It doesn't sound like much but I thought that it might have a change to present something interesting. Unfortunately, the plot turned out to be a series of quite ordinary and especially predictable events, being pretty much boring most of the time. It doesn't seem able to bring something interesting into the equation, even though I still think that it had potential to do it. Its characters are also quite ordinary, doing pretty much what you would expect them to do while not being very sympathetic along the way. They seem just average, with no clear pluses but also no big minuses either; plain average I might say.The dialog is pretty simple, without much substance or something that might make it stand out in any way. It can even get boring from time to time but it's still average most of the time. The action is pretty limited, all events happening slowly without anything that might bring a change of pace. It starts slowly and it keeps it that way until the end. Some of the events don't even have a true meaning when it comes to the outcome. They seem to be there just because they've ran out of ideas or something. In terms of atmosphere, the movie also maintains an average pace, making everything seem ordinary, thus not being able to generate much emotion. You do get a bit of drama from time to time, but too scarce and weak for my taste and unfortunately that's about it. Although it's labeled as a comedy, you should definitely search elsewhere if you looking for a laugh as you're certainly not going to find it here, which is quite a shame.I find it a bit hard to talk about this movie as its boring plot left me with a sour taste. The characters were unfortunately on par with the story while the events featured are mostly predictable and simply not interesting.

36,Carycomic,The one modern comedy that my parents liked just as much as I did!,10,10 September 2017,"First off, let me say that this film was a pure delight. So, all three of us were kind of shocked and amazed that WE WERE THE ONLY THREE PEOPLE at the matinée performance! What is up with the movie-going public, today? Are we getting so jaded with gritty crime thrillers (over-reliant on swearing) and horror films (over-reliant on computer-generated gore) that we consider ourselves too sophisticated for a nice, old-fashioned romantic comedy? Well, for those who answered ""yes"" to both questions, then I say ""Shame on you!""The relative newcomers who played Harry, George, and Ted really shined as naive-but-determined independent filmmakers. The two girls who played Isabella and Rosie were suitably cute and precocious. Candice Bergen was just plain great at playing the liberated Baby Boomer who's now a grandmother. And Reese Witherspoon was hilariously convincing as a maritally separated single mom who is unexpectedly put in charge of this three-ring domestic circus.But, who (of course) successfully rises to meet the challenge.In short? This was like ""Brady Bunch"" meets ""The 3 Stooges."" And I defy anybody to give higher praise than that. Especially, if they're wise enough to see it with the whole family.",Home Again
37,trinaboice,Not Witherspoon's best rom-com,6,28 October 2017,"Grade: CRating: PG-13, 1 hour 37 minutesIn a Nutshell: No, this movie isn't related to the 2013 Home Again movie with Tatyana Ali. This rom-com features America's sweetheart, Reese Withersppon, but certainly is not her best work. You'd think they would have picked a different name. Something like ""Shacks Up with An Impetuous Boy Toy"" would be appropriate.Uplifting theme: ""This is your day, your year. Get ready Alice. The future is yours!"" - Alice's father Family comes in different shapes and sizes. Be open to change.Things I liked: Alice's little blonde daughter is adorable, played by Eden Grace Redfield. She has a bright future in film and TV if she wants one. You can also see her in The Glass Castle. They play Heads Up! in a musical montage, so you might miss it. It's a free app and a lot of fun! Alice's boy toy is played by Pico Alexander. Teddy is played by Nat Wolff. Did you know his mother is Polly Draper (thirtysomething: Season 1) and his father is Michael Wolff, the bandleader on the old Arsenio Hall Show? Nice pedigree! I love Candace Bergen in anything. It's always great to see her. Jon Rudnitsky playes the only one in the movie who acts like a responsible grown up. We'll see him again in James Franco's upcoming movie The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever MadeThings I didn't like: Throwing up, sleeping with a stranger after just meeting. Nope. Not glamorous. Alice and her boy toy are sluts. What happened to old fashioned romance? Lots of music montages with talking, laughing, drinking, and kissing. The boy toy acts selfishly when he storms out when his friends explain they're working on additional projects. Instead, he should be happy for them. He seems young and immature and self-centered the entire time. Alice (Reese Witherspoon) makes some very bag parenting choices. For example, she brings in three male strangers to live in her house, even though she has two young daughters. That's just asking for trouble in the real world. Sleeping with one of them is irresponsible and confusing for the children. It's supposed to be adorable and charming in the movie, but it frustrated me. The premise is pretty unrealistic and ridiculous. Instantly forgettable. Tips for parents: ""Can't I just go on anti-depressants just like everyone else?"" – Isabel (Lola Flanery) She talks about having anxiety and depression and watches her mom pop pills every time she has a problem.

Candice Bergen plays an unbelievable part as her mom who catches the guys passed out on the sofa overnight and gets charmed like silly putty into letting them stay, more like insisting they stay instead of telling them to get lost.

It's written and directed by Hallie Meyers-Shyer and there's clearly a lot of artistic influence from her mother Nancy Meyers, writer/director of films such as The Holiday and It's Complicated. This film has a big stylistic similarity to those kind of rom-coms and personally, I love those films! It seems like quite a personal film with Alice's parents being in the film business and there's a lot of love shown for cinema on that side with the lovely scenes of the guys looking at old John Kinney film posters and memorabilia, while also representing the darker side of it with the producers that the boys need to deal with that prefer action sequences over their artistic integrity.

This is the wonderland where: * everybody and everything is basically nice and good-looking, and conflicts just go way or soon resolve in the nicest way possible; * recently separated jobless mother of two who has just reached middle-age and moved to the other side of the country can live in a really nice comfortable house which she doesn't have to pay for; * she meets true love in the form of a guy 13 years her junior, who's tall, strikingly good-looking, socially adept, creative, confident, kind, ambitious, loves her children, and also has two best friends who can be described much the same way; * people can and will trust each other, and create strong bonds instantly * everybody's just so damn understanding all the time, even children are not bordering on awful like in real-life * and so on. All this goodness is based on the debuting writer-director Hallie Meyers-Shyer, and (more importantly) produced by her mother Nancy Meyers who's also responsible for her fair share of chick crack, including What Women Want"", Something's Gotta Give"", and It's Complicated"". The result will be near-insufferable to many, including the critics – Metacritic gives it 41/100, Rotten Tomatoes 33/100, both offer users' scores in lower 50s. But me, I quite enjoyed it – always had a soft spot for this kind of thing. The authors have created exactly what they were aiming for, and everything is put together very well. What's more important, the actors are enjoyable and feel surprisingly sincere considering the high cheesiness factor of the whole thing. The events and dialogue are not original in any way, of course, but the cast really makes it work, be it the screen veteran club (Reese Witherspoon, Candice Bergen, Michael Sheen, Lake Bell) or the trio of young and fresh hunksters (Nat Wolff, Pico Alexander, Jon Rudnitsky) that even Zoolander would envy for their impossibly good- looking-ness. Together they create an ultimate feel-good atmosphere – a cinematic comfort food that is probably meant for 50+ midder- and upper-class American ladies, but works for little girls of every age and sex, including myself. All the others, who will not get it"", probably have a horrible time of living through all 97 minutes of this. Just remember: let yourself be transported to magic neverland where life really is like in magazines, and all will be fine. Home Again"" is the movie equivalent of something canned milk: one craves it for irresistible one-two punch of sweetness which is always the same and way too sweet for many, but if you stomach this type of thing, it's gonna be delicious. Reese Witherspoon probably realized that it's cool to be serious and versatile actress and all, but despite the good looks she's not actually getting any younger. So she found some time to make another chick flick, a mental successor for her ""Legally Blonde"" series, and grab younger demographic tightly by the tits until she can.

46,Padreviews,Really sweet 8/10,8,7 December 2017,"Watching this completely by chance on a silver screening Reese Witherspoon is just adorable as a financially secure single mum still suffering from abandonment anxiety from her childhood with a wherever I lay my hat father , a relationship she emulates with her estranged husband . Age gaps are a common theme from her dad's relationship with Candice Bergman's character to her husband to the trio of hunks her mum inadvertently invites to stay . There's great character development with a mr nice guy and a mr idiot Do first think after and you can guess which one she ends up with - perhaps a cliché but certainly emulates real life What's endearing is the relationship between the trio and her daughters . The alpha Male expected conflict comes along to potentially ruin things - showing how loyalty and immaturity are strange bedfellows. As I don't want to put any spoi lers in this I'll say not all the wisdom comes with age , you realise that the boys are a red herring but hope she ends up with the nice guy rather than the thoughtless idiot, she deserves better. Her stereotype of what men and women are like felt a bit incongruous but it's her opinion . The back story of the boys struggling to make their first film make you think of goodwill hunting ( or least the break they got in making it ) Damon/Afleck getting their break . Hollywood imitating itself is usually an interesting incite into the industry itself and this is one of the better ones .

Who is married to a music executive in New York. But things aren't working out so she moves across the country to L.A. to start over with her two small daughters. I'm talking pre-teen and maybe 5 years old. She's the daughter of a famous and successful movie director. And a famous and successful movie actress. Who fortunately have a spare million dollar mansion for them to move into. (You know, like most of us.) Complete with sculpted topiary, fountains, a pool and a fully stocked guesthouse.She's already had two failed businesses. And she's trying to get a third one off the ground. Her first customer walks all over her. And when she adds more non-business favors and offers to pay, Alice politely tells her she doesn't have to pay her anything. (I wonder why her two previous businesses failed?) She never makes any money. But she always has lots. (You know, like most of us.)Alice's friends take her out to celebrate her 40th birthday. While partying, they meet 3 gorgeous young twenty something hunks. They all have a good time and end up back at Alice's luxury mansion. She is just about to sleep with one of them, when he realizes he drank too much. So, he runs to the bathroom to throw up.Next morning he wakes up in her bed stark naked. She's in her sleeping clothes rapped in a sheet on a couch in her bedroom. (Rich people have living room furniture in their bedrooms.) He's surprised he's naked. She apparently washed, dried and folded his clothes. (How did he get naked? What if a man had done that to a woman?) Alice swears they never had sex.The rest of the party is passed out in one of her many living rooms on the floor, chairs and sofas. One of the three young guys stumbles mistakenly into the father's office while looking for a restroom. The young men are aspiring movie makers who quickly realize they know who Alice's parents are.Alice's mother returns with the children. And after a few well placed compliments, the mother decides --- now get this --- it's a good idea to have the three young men move into the guest house !!! THEY DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE !!! THEY COULD BE SERIAL KILLERS, CRIMINALS, OR AT LEAST STRANGERS OF BAD CHARACTER !!!This is what every single mother of two young daughters needs, right --- to share their home with three strange men?BUT WAIT !!! THIS IS A ROM COM. EVERYTHING IS GONNA WORK OUT GREAT !!!Everything is sugary, there is bouncy music, and every character has a heart of gold. Immediately the young men start cooking, cleaning, fixing her computer, and helping the children with their homework. Alice tells them the father's old Porche is in the garage. So of course, one of the young men fixes it and starts running errands, including bringing the girls back and forth to school.

How many of us have famous rich parents with a spare mansion to move into rent free? How many single mothers of two little girls would invite three strange young men they just picked up in a bar, to live with them?There are lots of scenes of people walking on the beach, laughing, drinking, at parties, and around the kitchen table. You know --- just like most single mothers and most homeless young guys trying to get started in L.A. experience. What a wonderful life.

There, in a bar, she meets three struggling young filmmakers. And as a means of subsidizing the overburdened financial status of the young auteurs until their movie deal comes through, she invites then to move temporarily into her guesthouse. Naturally, she falls for one of them.""Home Again"" is the kind of movie which during the early 1960s would've been performed to perfection by Doris Day, Rock Hudson, and Tony Randall. In ""Home Again,"" the roles are filled by Reese Witherspoon, Michael Sheen, and Pico Alexander, standing in for the classic trio of stars of ""Pillow Talk,"" ""Lover Come Back,"" and other classics of the early-sixties romantic comedy genre.As such, ""Home Again"" often feels like a fairly decadent anachronism, one which seems as if it might've been financed on the familial heritage of its writer/director, Hallie Meyers-Shyer. Young Meyers-Shyer is the daughter of two experts of this once- lucrative style of motion picture—Nancy Meyers, the director of ""What Women Want"" from 2000 and ""Something's Gotta Give"" from 2003, and Charles Shyer, the director of 1980's ""Private Benjamin"" and 1987's ""Baby Boom."" Mother Nancy Meyers' name actually appears in the credits of ""Home Again"" as a producer, and the family connection is emphasized in the film's advertising, with the writer/director's name featured prominently on the poster-art, even though this is the 30-year-old director's first filmmaking effort.""Home Again"" is amusing enough, if you're in the mood for a superficial examination of the lives and worries of the veddy, veddy rich. The problems depicted in this movie seem almost to be like good ones to have, especially to those souls among us who have trouble getting together their rent and food money.But for others, ""Home Alone"" is a reminder that in Hollywood, talent is not necessarily a hereditary commodity.

When I was a kid I went to movies to escape real life and live in the rich fantasy of happy endings. I wouldn't call this a romantic comedy, there is romance, there is comedy but it's mostly just a cute sweet movie. Sometimes I need to cute sweet movie to immerse myself into so I can escape the too often harshness of real life.It's not realistic but I wish it were. They acting is great, I was expecting the 3 young men to be good but they were and the girls were incredible. I always enjoy seeing Candace Bergman on screen, would love to see her in a staring role because she is an incredible actor and of course Reese does a great job although I'm used to seeing her in meatier roles.If you like a nice feel good movie where no one gets blown up you should like this movie.

The plot with the quality of actors in it could have been good had they been given something with a bit more meat to it. We'd like to see more female-centered movies that are topical and actually say something. Witherspoon's character, oh so much more could've been done there, and still hold some bright comedy with the poignancy of separation and starting over at 40. It's kind of a Hollywood women's indulgence film, and we get a lot of those from the other side, so I guess it's forgivable, but to find a Home, not again, but kind of for the first time in her life, that would have been a much better story.

74,darcywinchester,Give this feel good movie a try,7,11 January 2018,"In this Hallie Meyers-Shyer (Father of the Bride, What Women Want) written and directed film, Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde, Walk the Line) stars as Alice, a single Mum recently separated from her husband Austen (Michael Sheen: Passengers, The Queen), who has stayed in New York City while she has moved to L. A. with their daughters Isabel (Lola Flanery: Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments, TVs Mary Kills People) and Rosie (Eden Grace Redfield: The Glass Castle, I'm Sorry) to live in her father's old house.
Following a drunk-fuelled birthday night with her friends, whilst her daughters are with her mum Lillian (Candice Bergen: Sweet Home Alabama, Bride Wars) overnight, Alice invites three young aspiring-filmmaker guys (brothers Harry (Pico Alexander: A Most Violent Year, War Machine) and Teddy (Nat Wolff: The Fault in our Stars, Paper Towns) and friend George (Jon Rudnitsy: Patchwork, TVs Criminal Minds)) to her house. When her Mum returns early the next morning with the girls before school, the boys are still there and they recognise her as an actress and conversation steers to their interest in the father work as a film-maker. Lillian convinces Alice to invite them to move in and despite the age difference and attraction between Alice and Harry, it works. The boys are doing well with trying to get their careers off the ground as a popular horror filmmaker named Justin Miller (Reid Scott: Dean, TVs Veep) is interested in working with them and they help out around the house while Alice works for new client Zoey Bell (Lake Bell: No Strings Attached, It's Complicated), in particular George bonds with Isabel, an anxious and shy girl, because they are both writers.
Estranged husband Austen finds out and is not happy about three strange men living with his daughters and he moves in to keep an eye on things. The boys do not like Austen as they think he is bad for Alice but what will Alice decide?I thought this was a charming movie, a real departure from the horror, fantasy and action movies that were out at the same time. Witherspoon was perfect in the role and though the script was somewhat predictable, it was entertaining. Its themes were love, loyalty, parenting and other life obstacles of modern society. I enjoyed the story of the older daughter, Isabel, coming out of her shell with the encouragement of George (Rudnitsky was the stand out in this movie), but the film did feel rushed in parts and could have done with more character development.
The romance is not the main thread of the movie but a light heart warming look at relationships, be they friendship or family. There are some laughs to be had and I came away from the film uplifted, so despite some of the very negative reviews, I recommend that you give this feel-good movie a try.",Home Again

79,imdb-936-837144,Struggling artists in L.A. look for a break.,8,11 September 2017,"Alice Kinney (Reese Witherspoon) has been separated for five months from her New York husband Austen (Michael Sheen.) She's moved to her deceased father's house in L.A. to pursue a career as a home decorator. Her web­site is kaput, yet she has one so-so lead. Her two little daughters are about to be enrolled for their first day of school. They see their father every other weekend.Three struggling artists Harry (27) the lead singer of the band, Teddy the rising star, and George an unproven script writer have hit the big city running. After three days their funds run out, so they go out drinking and run into Alice celebrating her 40th birth­day. Owing to a woman's sexual prime occurring later than a man's it seems likely Alice and Harry might hook up (""Let's be friends."") At least the three men will find a place to crash for the night.When they recognize Alice's mom Lillian as once having played the lead in ""Lola,"" a connection is made. She makes a suggestion to Alice: ""They need a place to crash, and you've got a guest house.""In James A. Michener's 1959 ""Reader's Digest"" article, ""The Hardest Working Women in the World"", he observes that while in most countries middle class women will have some kind of servants to help with the house­work, comparable American women don't. Quoting an example from *A Michener Miscellany: 1950–1970* (NY: Random House, 1973), ""a staff of helpers such as most Chinese families would have: three indoor servants, a gardener, a driver  the joy of having a built-in baby-sitter"" (38). A friend of Alice remarks concerning her three house­guests that altogether she has: ""live-in child care, free tech support, and sex."" It's a fact of life that in Hollywood success as a screenwriter does not occur overnight. As Stuart Woods put it in his novel, *Beverly Hills Dead* (NY: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 2008) ""I don't think you should count on price for the treatment; after all, we're talking about a new writer, not an established one"" (120). These boys' script doesn't take off any faster than one would expect. Further­more, there is resistance from Harry when his two partners seek to acquire some needed independent income to tide them over: George from rewriting horror scripts, and Teddy applying for other parts.""Home Again"" is actually a classic take on (Prov. 12:9) ""He that is despised and hath a servant, is better than he that honoreth him­self, and lacketh bread."" Reese Wither­spoon does a bang up job playing the ""single mom"" whom guys fall all over them­selves trying to help, though she meets disapproval from certain quarters. That's better than Pico Alexander who as Harry nails it as a guy with too much self-worth to allow independence in his friends to contribute until he makes it.I yearly honor the Jan. 19 birthday of Robert E. Lee as a tribute to my southern family roots that passed on to me a sense of hospitality, courtesy, and slow pace of life, from a culture where women had ""the joy of having a built-in baby-sitter,"" though some do disparage that culture's earlier practice. When I tried to buy a Robert E. Lee T-shirt from a black vendor of T-shirts at an open air market in town, he informed me that he didn't sell any Civil War T-shirts. I had to order one on the WEB. But then numerous people at the market have complimented me on my shirt. There's a ready market here in Oregon for these shirts, which the black vendor has not tapped. The above proverb and this movie help put the difference in outlooks into perspective.Abraham Lincoln in his Emancipation Proclamation enjoined the now freemen to accept whatever work was available for reasonable wages, but their descendants, it seems, now will pass on income that insults their black pride. Lincoln also enjoined them to put aside animosity and abstain from violence. These days they are pulling down statues of the general, even though he is hardly going to be fighting for the South again. In this movie when Alice's estranged husband plays a surprise visit, there results some childish fisticuffs with one of Alice's guests. Sometimes life and art imitate each other.This movie showcases Reese Witherspoon's talent of portraying a determined woman for whom fate shines favor­ably. The men in the movie get a bumpy ride as they learn from the lumps they take. It's a chick flick all the way. Even has a female director. The one fight scene is hardly manly. The women engage in seemingly endless chatter, but I suppose other women will enjoy that. I'm not marking it down any for targeting an audience other than me, because it should be fine for the women. It contains a universal lesson per one of the proverbs, and I was able to enjoy it regardless.",Home Again

Harry the ""love interest "" isnt the best option for her in my opinion as I would match rather she gets with George who has an amazing relationship with her daughter Isobel.

In the meantime, they fill the void in Reese's life in terms of sex, cooking, nannying and ICTing. And THIS is why this movie should me avoided at all costs:Flat, one-dimensional characters A brainfart of a storyA typical unrealistic Hollywood fantasy without any comedyWhat's up with all the sitting around the table and laughing scenes? A fat Martin Sheen in a stupid role (this one doesn't really count but it bothered me)How in EARTHS name does Reese pay for things? It's daddy's house, OK. But how does she pay for all her sh*t? Going out to dinner with friends, having a macbook, raising two kids and driving a bl**dy Volvo XC90 T6? Without a (steady) job?? Only in Hollywood fantasyland!I wonder what the target group for this movie is. Here, in Holland, we are way too 'down to earth' for these kind of movies (yes, that's a flaw too).

112,Tom-Livanos,A very narrow exploration of returning to one's parents' home,1,21 July 2020,"I am the same age as Reese Witherspoon (give or take about 10 days). I spent 6-7 years away from home to pursue a career change. That did not work out so I returned home to my parents' place (both parents still alive).The title to this movie, 'Home Again' and the tagline ""Starting Over is not for Beginners"" are such a narrow part of the film as to make them irrelevant - even misleading. This film is about a single mother and her young daughters being okay with a decision to divorce the father/husband and the difficulties associated with making a movie (which is not what Reese Witherspoon's character is trying to do).There are many reasons why a person - female or male (alphabetical) - would return to the home of her/his parent/s. A film which focuses on that experience would focus on readjusting to life with one's parent/s if still alive, perhaps caring for them, revisiting one's childhood and adolescence, reflections on how to be financially independent, perhaps exploring old friendships and new, what is happening with one's siblings (if any).......... Films about female empowerment have a legitimate place in cinema and other forms of art - it is a terrible mistake to disguise such a movie as something else. I am a fan of Reese Witherspoon (before 'Legally Blonde' e.g. with 'Pleasantville') but... sheesh... this was an awful disappointment.",Home Again

I like user reviews because I can read between the lines and get a feel as to whether or not I'm going to like this film. It's not fool proof but better than professional reviews for me.
So this film has elements that could have made it a really good film and didn't wuite reach its potential.
First- the script was not quite there. Parts of it worked well other parts were in the WTF category. The premise that a women missing family could end up creating her own family was good. The execution went from this is really interesting to ok here's the stock Hollywood cliche...
The directing was excellent in some scenes to hey lets phone in our acting and directing.
The acting went from quite good to we're just saying our lines and the directors gone to craft service while the 3rd ad tries to get the scene. There is no chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Pico Alexander... let alone her ex Micheal Sheen.I would have preferred Jon Rudnitsky as the romantic lead- there was at least some chemistry.I was ready to walk out on this but my wife guilted me into watching it and I was glad I did. It's got some redeeming features- the opening credits promise a lot more than is delivered. There are moments in the film that the writing, directing and acting show what could have been. So it's worth a watch. Not as bad as some critics have claimed and not as good as others have claimed either.
Hallie Meyers-Shyer shows promise- this needed more rewrites on the script, better casting, better acting and more consistent directing.",Home Again
116,adieldevilliers,Being home again,8,19 September 2017,"I have been reading the reviews of this movie and it is infuriating. Not all movies are made for critics, and not all movies are made for everyone. This movie was made for a specific market. Young woman needing to escape the everyday and enjoy something fun and happy. Yes I realized that the cast were all white. And had two small parts (the pizza guy and the guy in the movie) that was not white. But after thinking about it. It was a family, grandma, mom, dad and 2 kids, that was okay that they were all white, being a family and all. the 3 guys were 2 brothers and a childhood friend from upstate New York. they were dreamers not living in the reality of real life. They were white. Also okay, lots of 20 something film students out there living in a dreamworld. So we have the agents, producer and money guy, kid's teacher, sure one of them could have been Black or Latino. I don't think that would have helped a lot. Can't recall any black characters in 'The Holiday' or 'The Dressmaker"". The movie is about a lost woman in her 40s finding her identity and home, by helping three dreamers pursue their dream. She has a fling with one of them, but realize that going back isn't the answer. I loved the dialogue between the characters. The conflict and the interaction. The movie could have been simpler, not 2 Jasons, or 3 movie makers, but the tone of the movie would have suffered for it. The music score was perfect, the pace was perfect, acting was above average. The set design was amazing, I want to live in that house. I love this movie.

In her defense, this is her first movie. Perhaps she'll get better with time... although that hasn't happened with Tyler Perry (he refuses to grow in this medium and consistently goes for the cheap laugh, but I digress). The problem with Home Again is EVERYTHING.The lighting gives it an almost Hallmark/Lifetime made for tv type of feel. The acting is subpar. Even Reese, whom I adore, appears to have just been handed the script an hour before filming. The writing is something my sixth grade students would hand in. And the plot (I guess it had one) is just boring. About halfway through the movie I honestly took out my phone and searched Google for places I'd rather be. I guess this is what you get when you make movies for a very small percentage of the population. I bet anyone who ""liked"" this movie couldn't tell you what's it's about.

Each of them also has a great rapport with her and her children that is just adorable to watch. Witherspoon is a believable single mom with normal home problems, and the presence of the three young men adds love and personal support into the mix. And it works. 
This movie portrays a woman in a way that I can get behind. She doesn't date one of the young guys staying with her because she wants to recapture her youth or make someone jealous or for some other superficial reason. She is drawn to him like she would be any other man. The movie highlights, for me, how often youth and women are underestimated in movies, especially ones like these. Younger guys aren't always stupid boy toys or hot, forbidden affairs, and moms are not all Mrs. Robinson.

It is a light, sweet, heart warming movie, it has the look and feel of some of the old 90's movies in my opinion (credit to Cinematographer Dean Cundey, Back to the Future, Apollo 13), and a nice story. The romance factor isn't really the central focus of the movie and it may give you an inspiring thought to do a kind deed for a friend or a child.

I've seen lots if not, all the movies and this one just didn't quite convinced me, but I do have to say that Reese is a sweet and great actress, just go watch it and see for yourselves, may be you'll like it, we all have different opinions.",Home Again
167,eurolauras,Cute and will make you smile,8,23 October 2017,"I think we need more movies like this again. Haven't had enough romantic comedies as of late and it's nice to just watch a comfortable and light movie to escape. The friendships and family relationships in this movie all made me smile. Don't get me wrong I love all types of movies but it's nice to see a movie like this again that doesn't include nudity, vulgar language and focuses on positive relationships. There's so much cheap shock in movies and TV recently that this is an actual feel good escape.",Home Again
168,kykynii,Funny and heartwarming,7,23 November 2017,"Home again is a kind of movie that will make you smile. It's light, funny, and entertaining. It started out easy and simple. and then the story line builds up. We may guess the end of this movie, but with this kind of movie, you just really kind of goes with it. Weak point though, who in the world let 3 male strangers move in to your house when you have daughters in primary school.",Home Again
169,bocamocha5,Okay movie,5,11 June 2018,"It's an okay movie. It seemed like a Hallmark Made for TV movie, not a Hollywood Blockbuster. I love Reese Witherspoon's movies, so this was a bit of a disappointment.",Home Again
170,gothichippy-61111,Awesome Feel Good Movie,10,12 February 2018,"I rented this movie first On Demand after a horrible work day. I just felt I needed something to help me relax. And this movie delivered exactly what I needed. I loved it. After watching this movie, all of the bad from my day was gone. It definitely is one of the best feel good movies I have ever watched. The characters were so real and relatable. The story, to me, was perfect. It had just the right amount of romance, and humor. Reece Witherspoon was great in this. The 3 guys that play Harry, George, and Teddy were wonderful and I just wanted to hug them all. This movie just really depicts real life situations that can happen and it does it wonderfully. It is a movie about starting over, and it hits the nail on the head. I've been through a very similar situation personally and I could totally relate to this movie. After seeing it On Demand, I went and bought the DVD and have watched it another 6 times. I may need to buy another copy, because I think I will wear the first one out. Anyone who gives this movie a low rating, just doesn't get it. I personally loved the movie and I would recommend it to anyone. It is definitely in my list of favorites. I applaud everyone in it and associated with it and say job well done.",Home Again
171,emilygardner-70186,Is no one allow to enjoy a Rom Com anymore?,8,26 May 2018,"I don't know why the reviews for this movie are so poor. I found it to be a heartwarming story about family and relationships, and really funny. Sure, it wasn't groundbreaking, but I enjoyed watching it. Reese did an excellent job of portraying a strong, newly single mom. Don't let the bad reviews turn you off!",Home Again

174,gmczene,Home Again #SoWhite,1,13 January 2019,"I didn't like Reese's performance in Big Little Lies, so I resisted watching this for a while. Sadly, I was right.
It's Oh So White. No diversity, no surprises, too cutesy, precocious, white.The plot is implausible: who lets three broke guys live in their guesthouse, when you have two little kids at home? I guess it's o.k., because they were... oh soo white.Who in this day and age sleeps with a guy you pick up in a bar, unless he is ... oh soo white.And the mother who makes breakfast for them and turns over the guest house to three strangers .. who are oh so white.I guess it is Hollywood, which is still oh so white.",Home Again
