0,SnoopyStyle,Reasonable performance,7,22 May 2014,"It's a biopic of the great boxer Muhammad Ali (Will Smith). It starts in 1964 when still as Cassius Clay defeats Sonny Liston for the heavyweight championship. Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) befriends the young fighter. He is outspoken, converts to Islam joining the Nation of Islam, and becomes the world wide icon. Jon Voight makes a nice turn as Howard Cosell.Muhammad Ali is such a big personality. Possibly nobody could ever do him justice. Certainly nobody could ever live up to the legend. Will Smith is probably the only one who could make the attempt. The fact that he didn't embarrass himself is a big win. It is a surprise that director Michael Mann made this movie. It doesn't have the kinetic energy of his other movies. It's such a dour performance. Will is playing it with simmering anger every second of the movie. He's great with Ali's voice, but it doesn't have any joy in it. Will is good hitting that same note over and over again. I just wish he hit other notes in his performance. 'When We Were Kings' is a superior movie for comparison. This is a good biopic not not much more.",Ali
1,Horst_In_Translation,Not even close to doing justice to the legend it is about,6,24 September 2020,"""Ali"" is an American, mostly English-language movie from 2001, so this one has its 20th anniversary next year. It runs for over 2.5 hours, so at least the duration is where it should be to be accurate for Muhammad Ali, one who is considered by many one of the greatest athletes in sports history. And maybe the greatest boxer who ever existed, although there are other contenders too like LaMotta, Marciano and, more recently, Mayweather. But if we only talk about heavyweights, it's maybe tough to argue against Ali. Sadly, this film is no movie heavyweight by any means, but I will get to that later. The director here is Michael Mann and I got to watch this film on the big screen on the occasion of a Michael mann retrospective, for which I am grateful, but must also say that this is among the weakest from what I have seen by Mann in the last couple weeks. He is also one of the writers here and you could say that it is a bit of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Mann worked with Roth again, with whom he collaborated on other projects, plus there is another duo of writers who have worked together in the past too and also were both Oscar nominees. You can check out their names too if you like. Plus there is a writer of the original story, who has also been part of other significant projects, even without major awards attention. But the one everybody here has talked about was Will Smith. He plays Muhammad Ali. Okay casting choice I suppose. I think the Oscar nomination may have been a bit too much, but other than that he kept the movie going okay, his hammy moments are not too frequent and sometimes also because of the sub-par writing. So it's a movie where he is basically in every scene from beginning to end and for that he does a decent job. And also I may be a bit baised because my appreciation for Smith has gone down considerably in recent years, so big fans of his will maybe enjoy it more than I did. Enjoy him more than I did. This decline in appreciation also has more to do with his wife than with him for sure and some of her/their comments about equality in Hollywood. I deem them racist, but that is another story. And let's not even get started about her having an affair with her son's buddy. What the heck? But yeah, let's not drift too far away from this film now. Jada Pinkett (Smith) is also in this movie and it is basically the perfect evidence of her not being talented and she would be nowhere career--wise without her husband I'm sure. Sadly Smith (in contrast to Ali) did not ditch her quickly. As for the rest of the cast, I find it extremely baffling how Jon Voight got an Oscar nomination for hie performance here. I must say I did not even recognize him, but maybe this appreciation is also linked to the make-up folks or the character he plays, but honestly I must say that there is almost nothing to his character and the friendship between him and the boxer was not depicted or portrayed in a way as meaningful that you'd think he received any award recognition for it. One of the most forgettable accting noms I have seen, even a definite contender for the first position. So yeah, compared to this, even Smith's nomination was really justified. As for the rest of the cast, you will see some more familiar faces in here like Jamie Foxx and Joe Morton. Breaking Bad' Giancarlo Esposito is also part of this film, but his screen time is so miniimal that it's easy to miss him. Same is true for Ted Levine. Such a great actor and he was completely wasted for a one scene role that an extra could have played. As for the girls, there are not really any except the three love interests to Ali and it says a lot that the ring girl has more screen time than almost all the other females in here. But Mann is known for male-centered movies, so no surprise. Actually he is the epitome of that, way more extreme than Tarantino who is also still (although not really justified) seen like that.But genders don't matter anyway. The real problem with this film lies elsewhere. And it is present from beginning to end: I am talking about how it all feels pretty shallow. It is fairly entertaining yes, but it is never education, let elone epic as it could have been with the man this story is about. Just take the story with Foxx' character. There is almost nothing before or after the crucial moment when we see him in bed and he says he lost all the money and eventually Ali takes him back. But this story could have been way better. Or take the Malcolm X part (occasionally mistook him for Fox too). That was so showy. We see his assassination very visually, but have not much of a connection between him and Ali before that at all. In a great film, we would have gotten proper elaboration before that and maybe then a call that Ali receives where he finds out about the killing. Again, style over substance. Voight's subplot was okay, but not awards-worthy like I said, and Don King's inclusion was alright too I suppose, certainly among the better aspects here. The man turns 90 next year. I also liked how Ali stood up against him and for his Italian-American buddy. But there again, it sucked because in the long time before that, two hours or so, we barely get any elaboration on why these two are this close. Maybe I am a bit biased here too with this movie because I did not see Ali in a likable way at all. He seems boastful, arrogant and unfaithful and all this more than once too it seems. I mean his reputation and class are undeniable, not even gonna go there, but I kinda prefer the quietly convincing characters. However, this is no criticism against Mann and the people who made this film if it relies on facts and I think it did. Even if a lot of it is still fictionalized, perhaps also the scene in bed with Smith and his wife early on when Ali keeps talking about how awesome he is, again showing us his massive ego. A bit of a weird inclusion if not based on some real footage or quotes, bit I wonder how it would be. What else? Oh yes, the sequence I just mentioned is accompanied by music and they did this on several occasions as we hear a mildly catchy tune in the background and not really the characters talking. Another example would be very early on with this rock concert and the cops who stop him when he is running (racism? ) before they are called to where they are actually needed. I must say I did not like these scenes too much. The approach is one that needs better execution than shown us here. What I did like, however, about this film, maybe liked more than anything else, were the fight sequences in the ring. Those were fine. Props to Smith there, also with his physicality that probably had a lot to do with his Oscar nomination (like with Bale in another boxing movie) and it is no surprise they cast actual boxers to play these greats from the history of the sport. I must say I was a bit critical about Foreman because there was a lot of talk about how he was young and rising and Ali in his early 30s already back then (not an age anymore today) and I felt the actor for Foreman looked way too old, but I checked and he was not much older than Foreman actually during this Rumble in the Jungle spectacle. This was actually the moment I planned on giving it a lower rating because it seemed so off, but eventually I will still be going with three stars out of five, even if it is much closer to two than to four and maybe on a rewatch I will give it two only. But now I will be generous. Like I said, however, one of Mann's more disappointing films for me for sure, even if Ali/Smith is luckily not as cringeworthy as the male cenntral character (lead) in Manhunter. Anything else to say about Ali? Only that like I said the movie is not even close to the level that the man this is about would have deserved, no matter if I like him or not. So I hope maybe they will come up with a new film. Ali himself will not see it anymore, but maybe audiences will. This one here should not be considered defining by any means, especially not when it comes to his religion. That could have been done better too. The closure moment especially when the Supreme Court declares him innocent (really? I mean it is undeniable he refused army service, more elboration on why would have been nice), but the way it is depicted here was fairly disappointing. It felt as if he did not even know this was the day they would decide. Oh well, maybe there really weren't any information given out back then about exact dates. Okay, what else? Ah yes, the famous butterfly/bee quote is also included at least twice and could also have been emphasized more convincingly. The epic shot many have as a photo on the wall from the Liston fight got better treatment. That's all now. Go watch this film, positively recommended, even if I am not enthusiastic about it at all and very accurate that it did not score a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards or anything.",Ali
2,Prismark10,Duck and weave,8,8 November 2013,"In the USA, Mohammed Ali is still a divisive figure, even to people who probably were not even alive when his boxing career was in its decline.To others outside the USA. Ali is universally acknowledged as a hero, someone who transcended his sport to become a well known personality.Michael Mann takes up the challenge to try to tweak out the various facets of Ali and show someone who is not an easy subject to capture but his boxing of course makes the narrative easier.The film ends with the Rumble in the Jungle when Ali beat Foreman.We go through the period when he could not box because of his stance against Vietnam and of course his earlier rise to become champion of world heavyweight boxing. Then his alliance with the Nation of Islam.Mann as expected does not go through a straight biopic. He elicits from Will Smith a great performance that was Oscar nominated. Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown should had also got recognition and Jon Voight under heavy make up is unrecognisable and he got a best supporting Oscar nomination.Mann took an auteur approach to his subject. Its narrative style was not too popular at the time of its release, mainly because everyone have their own ideas of what a Muhammad Ali should be like.Mann provides enough flourish to let the audience have an insight of this legendary boxer.",Ali
3,classicsoncall,"""I ain't got to be what nobody else want me to be, and I ain't afraid to be what I want to be...""",8,6 November 2006,"My youth and young adulthood coincided with Muhammad Ali's rise to the Heavyweight Championship, and I followed his bouts whenever they were shown on TV. Thankfully it was a time before routine fifty dollar pay per view cable events. However even though Ali's name had become a household word, I didn't know a lot about his private life, or the deeply held convictions that retreated behind the front page headlines. ""Ali"" does a nice job of chronicling the roughly ten year span between his first title win and the defeat of George Foreman after being stripped of the championship.Those who tune in and expect boxing to take center stage might be disappointed; many reviews on this forum express that. That might be missing the point of the film, as there are enough documentaries, interviews and fight films to pursue if that's what one is looking for. Director Michael Mann instead concentrates on Ali's Nation of Islam connection, his friendship with Malcolm X, the shattering of his ties with Elijah Muhammad, and ultimately the loss of the world title as a result of his refusal to be drafted. Besides presenting a sports hero, the film presents a human being showing the world that it's important to live by one's principles.I was intrigued by the almost symbiotic relationship revealed by the story between Ali and legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell (Jon Voight in a take notice role). If you caught their famous verbal battles back in the day, you would swear they were mortal enemies, yet even though they seemed to enjoy taking shots at each other, the scene during the Wide World of Sports segment showed just how loyal Cosell was to the Champ. It was also interesting to watch Ali's defense of trainer Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) during a pre fight briefing with promoter Don King; it showed that Ali wasn't a big fan of King.The biggest surprise of the story for me - Joe Frazier agrees to defend the title against Ali as the two men meet privately, with not a manager, promoter or lawyer in sight. Just two men agreeing to get it done, with a lot at stake for both winner and loser.The most inspirational moment, aside from actually winning the championship, is the training run in Kinshasa, Zaire, as the locals turn out to celebrate a hero. One wonders what had to be going through Ali's mind as he witnessed that turnout, it appeared incredibly moving on film.Undoubtedly, this was Will Smith's career role, and he pulled it off convincingly. He managed to capture the essence of the boxer and the man, earning the real Muhammad Ali's respect in the process, and what could be better than that.",Ali
4,lee_eisenberg,"Hard to determine sometimes, but they did a good job.",8,1 December 2005,"Covering Muhammad Ali's life from 1964 to 1974, ""Ali"" shows not only his athletic ability, but also his personal conflicts. In the title role, Will Smith not only shows that he can play a serious role, but also really gets into character, scoring a well-deserved Oscar nomination (although I'm glad that Denzel Washington won). Director Michael Mann never turns Ali into a God; this is a warts-and-all story, much like ""Ray"" was last year. Still, one has to wonder whether or not the people behind this movie lacked insight into their subject (sometimes, you do get that feeling). But no matter. This certainly is a movie worth seeing. My favorite part was Ali's denunciation of the Vietnam War.",Ali
5,jboothmillard,Ali,5,16 March 2009,"From director Michael Mann (The Last of the Mohicans, Collateral), I hoped this would be a good biographical drama with a great star playing one of the world's best known boxers. The film tells the story of Muhammad Ali (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Will Smith), aka Cassius Clay/Cassius X, who in 1964 won the heavyweight title, creating anew image for African American sportsmen. The film then follows his journey competing in many other fights with self confidence and belief that he is the best boxer in the world, his two marriages, his conversion to the Islam religion, a relationship with Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles), and concluding with the monumental fight against George Foreman (Charles Shufford). Also starring Jamie Foxx as Drew 'Bundini' Brown, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee, Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright as Howard Bingham, Mykelti Williamson as Don King, Jada Pinkett Smith (Will's wife) as Sonji, Nona Gaye as Belinda Ali, Michael Michele as Veronica Porche, Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Chauncey Eskridge, Paul Rodriguez as Dr. Ferdie Pacheco; Giancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay, Sr.; LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King, Jr., Albert Hall as Elijah Muhammad, Michael Bentt as Sonny Liston, James N. Toney as 'Smokin' Joe Frazier, Barry Shabaka Henley as Herbert Muhammad, Ted Levine as Joe Smiley and Star Trek: The Next Generation's Michael Dorn as Black Pilot. While Smith does a very convincing impression of Ali, and a nearly unrecognisable Voight does well too, it doesn't really focus on all events in a lot of detail, apart from the fights, so I agree with the critics that it is a pretty ordinary film. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching!",Ali
6,moonspinner55,"Impeccably produced, but with a haphazard narrative",6,17 November 2002,"Will Smith's physique is impressive, and his performance as boxing legend Muhammad Ali is rock solid, but Michael Mann's handsome, striking film does meander(especially in the final 45 minutes)and the script darts around issues and lets situations flag(especially in dealing with the Ali-Joe Frazier fight, which is cut awfully short). Never less than interesting, and with lots of room for introspection, but only half a success. The picture does look fantastic, though, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent. **1/2 from ****",Ali
7,Quinoa1984,I like your show and I admire your style...,6,28 December 2001,"Michael Mann's Ali is a film that has the elements in place for a movie that could've been better than it is.  It has the performances- Will Smith is a good choice for Ali and in his best scenes he shows some real talent (the best scenes with him were when he was in front of the TV camera with or without Voight as Cosel), Jamie Foxx as Bundini, Ali's half-drunken inspiration who gives the film a added comic punch, and Jon Voight in a miraculous transformation as Cosel who plays off Smith's Ali with the greatest of ease.  Plus the boxing scenes were (sometimes) quite enthralling.But like I said, these are the elements in place to make a good movie, but the film doesn't pull through.  Mann goes too long with details that aren't needed to illustrate Ali's thoughts and feelings and in contrast shows Ali and what he wants to do in and out of the ring but never gets inside of his psyche totally which would've been really interesting.  It is a longish and sluggish picture that at times can be good and at other times can be actually annoying: what is the point of the overlong jogging scene in Zaire, the overuse of dramatic music in scenes where it's not needed (I don't mind music for dramatic use but every 30 seconds is something I do mind) and having Martin Luther King's assassination when he plays a lot lesser of a role than Malcolm X did for Ali?  Overall, Smith is able to pull through as do other members of the cast, and there are things to look for, yet it's not worth sitting through the constant lulls.  If you want to see a great Mann movie rent Insider, Heat or even Manhunter.  C+",Ali
8,michaelRokeefe,The mouth that roared.,6,18 February 2003,"Michael Mann directs an interesting glimpse into the life of Muhammad Ali(Will Smith). The years 1964 to 1974 show us the winning of the world's championship of boxing, losing it and then the renowned Rumble in the Jungle. As well as the refusal to be drafted into military service and relationships with some diverse people as Malcolm X(Mario Van Peebles), Herbert Muhammad(Barry Shabaka Henely) and Howard Cosell(Jon Voight). The hard work of Will Smith to pull this whole thing off is obvious. And Voight's portrayal of Cosell is outstanding. The photography is excellent and the scenes in the ring are some to be unrivaled. The supporting cast includes:Ron Silver, Jamie Foxx, Michael Michele and Jada Pickett Smith. Ms. Michael needed no script; thanks for just being there. You need not be a fan of Ali to stick around till the final bell.",Ali
9,sunwarrior13,A Good Film About The Greatest,9,6 August 2013,"Ali is a biographical film that film tells the story of the boxer Muhammad Ali, played by Will Smith, from 1964 to 1974. Michael Mann directs.The story features the following events:his capture of the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston;his conversion to Islam; criticism of the Vietnam War; banishment from boxing; his return to the ring against Joe Frazier in 1971;and when he won once again the heavyweight title by taking it by upsetting George Foreman in 1974.When a filmmaker decides to make a film on Ali,who considers himself The Greatest,one must also expect the greatest film to be made about him.Unfortunately,it does not meet those standards.Despite the fact that Will Smith was able to capture the persona of The Greatest and willed himself to be Muhammad Ali,the script is far from being engaging.It is more concerned about details of the events of his life that it serves like a documentary rather than an entertaining film about the champ.Added to that,the viewer does not get to know the man more while watching it as the viewer is treated to a very long film more about the events that happened rather than the giving us the glimpse of the most charismatic boxer who had fun with his fame when he was the most known athlete of the world.",Ali
10,Theo Robertson,I Agree With Most Of The Critics,5,29 June 2003,"As always the problem of getting someone to play Muhammed Ali is that they don`t have the charisma to play the great man , hell not even Ali could play himself convincingly in THE GREATEST so I didn`t think Will Smith star of weak Summer blockbusters like WILD WILD WEST or the MIB films was going to be much cop in the title roleI do think Michael Mann is a good director and is rather underrated due to the fact he started out in television . Mann does bring realism to the fight scenes in ALI , they`re maybe not as good as the ones in RAGING BULL but they still pack a punch ( Sorry couldn`t resist that one ) , compare the ring scenes here to the laughably bad ones seen in the ROCKY  movies and you`ll notice a big difference . My only criticism of Mann in this film is that a few of the scenes outside the ring lack narritive drive with one of the characters saying something to another character and having the camer a linger too long on the characters moody look , but this is a minor flawThe serious flaw is something everyone else has pointed out and is something that I quickly noticed while watching ALI - The script is too overlong . I hadn`t read the readers comments untill I sat down to write this review so my views weren`t prejudiced but most of the reviewers are spot on , fight scenes feature as do politics , religion , Malcolm X , government spooks and Ali`s marital life and I can`t help thinking the whole film would have worked better if it had just focussed on Ali`s boxing career . As it is ALI isn`t a film I`d watch over and over again like RAGING BULLIt does have a positive point in its favour - The cast . If I hadn`t known what part Jon Voight was playing I`d have sat through the film wondering when he was going to turn up because he`s totally unrecognisable but he`s very good in his role . Ron Silver is almost unrecognisable but good as is Mario Van Peebles ,   but best of all is Will Smith as Muhammed Ali . Okay I could nit pick but that would be unkind and pedantic so all I`ll say is Smith deserved his Oscar nod",Ali
11,preppy-3,Muddled,4,14 January 2002,"Pic follows Muhammed Ali from 1964 to 1974 chronicling his winning the heavyweight championship, losing it and winning it again. This could have been good, but it fails in so many ways.For starters, Will Smith is totally miscast as Ali--Ali was handsome, full of life and charismatic--Smith is none of those things. When he shouts out Ali's rhymes he comes off like a loudmouth jerk--he totally lacks Ali's sing-song voice and great personality. His face is always blank all during the film--even the fight scenes! No depth of character comes through. Also (although I realize this is a matter of opinion) Smith is ugly--Ali wasn't. All in all he's not a good enough dramatic actor to carry the film.The script is lousy--very scattershot. It jumps all over the place and characters appear and disappear at a disturbing rate. For instance...Ali meets his second wife at a religious meeting. They just hold hands. The very next scene they're married, have a house AND a baby girl!Michael Mann's direction doesn't help. It's constantly in closeups of the character's faces. This makes sense during the boxing scenes...you're right in there in the ring. But when it's constant it gets very annoying...especially at 160 minutes.And the film is way too long. Two hours and forty minutes is overdoing it. The only good thing about this is all the actors (except for Smith) are great in their roles--especially Jon Voight doing a dead on impersonation of Howard Cosell. And the fight scenes are good.But this isn't worth seeing. If you want a good boxing movie rent ""Raging Bull"" or even ""Rocky"".",Ali
12,LeonLouisRicci,Disappointing and Failed Film,4,9 January 2013,"This is Movie expectations turned inside out. A great and stylish Director making a film with almost no stylistic charm, and a mediocre Actor giving a complete and against type performance. Who would have thunk it?This is a boring film about a flamboyant, talented athlete. It is almost an impossible task to take the turmoil and turbulence of such an interesting career in a troubled and spirited time place and make it into a shallow, confusing, indifferent, monotonous movie.It is a failed film that is a complete mess of meanderings through a World Champion fighters fight for civil rights, religious freedom, conscientious objection, and rebellious recognition. There are some, but very few attractions. The boxing is well handled visually, but lack comprehension of outcomes and nuances. The supporting cast, locations and ambiance are fine as are all the extras.There are also too many soulful tunes that seem intrusive as background and are given way too much attention. All in all Ali is at best a misfire and at worst a disorienting Biography.",Ali
13,grantss,"Great subject but, strangely, unengaging movie",6,4 February 2016,"Great subject but, strangely, unengaging movie.The story of Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, boxers who has ever lived. Shows from his first title bout (as Cassius Clay) until the conclusion of the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" versus George Foreman. Covers his conversion to Islam, his relationships, his being drafted into the Army and his refusal to go, his subsequent legal issues and a myriad of other details.Interesting, from an historical perspective, but feels flat and unengaging as a human drama. On paper it should work - the movie is directed by Michael Mann, of Heat, Collateral, Public Enemies, The Last of the Mohicans and Miami Vice fame. However, he is more an action-drama / thriller director and it shows, to a degree, in this movie. Characters aren't developed very well but the action scenes (in this case, the fight scenes) are great.Part of the problem is that Mann tries to cram as many events from Ali's life into the movie as possible. Even though the movie is fairly long at 2 1/2 hours, many of the lesser events are given a passing mention, with no real context. You often feel no connection to the event and they just feel like flashes across the screen.A better way to tackle the subject would have been to concentrate on the big themes and events of Ali's life, and leave out all the miscellaneous life. This, or make a mini-series rather than a movie. The man did and achieved so much, 2 1/2 hours is hardly enough time to encapsulate his life.On the plus side, as mentioned before the fight scenes are great. Well staged, well shot and very tense.Will Smith got a Best Leading Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Ali, but I am not sure he deserved it. Physically he is not imposing enough to be Ali. Furthermore, while he does a great job at capturing Ali's bravado and trash-talking, his verbal tone just doesn't seem right in normal speech. It's as if every line of dialogue is a speech, rather than just normal dialogue, and this can be quite irritating at times.Good supporting cast though. Jon Voight is almost unrecognizable as legendary sports presenter, and Ali's verbal sparring partner, Howard Cosell. He does a great job and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.Good work too from Jamie Foxx. The hidden gem is Mykelti Williamson who gives a great, over-the-top, often-hilarious performance as boxing promoter Don King.Overall, considering the subject, this movie is disappointing but there is enough there to keep you interested.",Ali
14,Calicodreamin,"Good acting, lacks focus",5,29 July 2020,"Great acting from the whole cast, but overall the storyline lacks focus. Lots of filler scenes could have been cut to streamline the main storyline. Good cinematography, but lacked on musical scoring. Overall, felt a bit lackluster.",Ali
15,Boba_Fett1138,He might arguably have been the greatest but this movie certainly isn't.,7,16 February 2006,"This biographic movie about Muhammad Ali is a solidly made but also flawed one.Biggest problem with the movie is its storytelling. Everything is happening way too fast, the one moment he is getting married and only a few moments later in the movie he is divorced and remarried again. This all happens in a time span of just some minutes. The movie tries to cover too much story and tries to tell too much in a too short amount of time. Also too many characters are introduced in the movie who ultimately don't play a significant enough role in the rest of the movie. Guess that is what happens when you almost completely re-write a already finished script. Also after watching this movie I don't really have the feeling that I now know who Muhammad Ali was and what drove him to do the things the way he did. Basically the movie is only about his boxing-career and although the movie focus on lots of other things the main essence always lies on the boxing. It never is explained in the movie why Ali boxed and there is very little told about his background and youth. Basically all I learned from this movie about Muhammad Ali was that he has a great sense of humor and was a real ladies-person.Still it's a solid enough movie. The movie is perfectly directed by Michael Mann who gives the movie lots of class and style. The movie has written Michael Mann all over it and that's a good thing to say.There also is nothing wrong with the acting. Will Smith might look that much alike Muhammad Ali but he plays so convincing that he becomes believable in his role. Also the almost unrecognizable Jon Voight was more than great in his role. Both actors received an Oscar nod for their role. Also really impressive was Jamie Foxx in a much smaller role.It's a very nicely made movie that absolutely is worth watching and is enjoyable enough, despite it's long running time. Still, if you want to learn more about Muhammad Ali, you most definitely are better of watching a good documentary about his life and/or career.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Ali
16,view_and_review,It's About How You Finish,7,3 February 2021,"It has taken me many years to finally watch ""Ali."" I've always been too afraid because, though before my time, he's a hero of mine. I always fret when Hollywood decides to tackle a biopic about historical figures I revere because I know Hollywood.While some parts did chafe me, the overall product was a net positive. Will Smith was stellar as Muhammad Ali and Jamie Foxx knocked his part out the box as Ali's friend and corner man Drew ""Bundini"" Brown. Still, I don't know that Ali cheated on his wife as was indicated. It may be true, but it almost seems too cliché. Furthermore, when I think of great people of the present or past, I don't think of their intimacy with their wives or girlfriends and I don't think it needs to be shown. Personally, I don't think any passionate or sexual moments enhance a film but, judging by 80% of the movies cranked out, I'm in the minority.Enough of my sermonizing.""Ali"" focused on a narrow, yet most captivating part of Ali's life. The movie starts with Ali training for his heavyweight title bout with Sonny Liston. Taking his Olympic gold medal out of the equation, Ali's win over Liston really jumpstarted his career. From there we saw his interaction with Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and the Nation of Islam. Van Peebles was wonderful in his brief presence and the production folks did justice to Malcolm X.There are no highs without the lows, and everyone's story has some lows. Instead of going into the end of Ali's career when there seemed to be more lows than highs, the movie concluded with his fight with Foreman (Charles Shufford). But before getting to that epic moment Ali suffered several setbacks, both personally and professionally. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.Wrapping up with ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" was pure brilliance. It was one of the most memorable highlights of Ali's career and they did it right. There were some gorgeous cinematic moments when Ali was in Zaire and the people were chanting ""Ali Bumaye!"" and again when Ali was fighting Foreman. If something as brutal as boxing could be made artistic, then director Michael Mann found the way. The camera angles, the sound, the distance of the external voices, the clarity of Ali's internal voice, the timely slo-mo, and the concluding music overplay was pure art. If you could win an award for a single scene, then the final scene of ""Ali"" was award worthy. Then to end it at that moment of victory and adulation was perfect. I wasn't sold on everything, but sometimes it's not how you start but how you finish.",Ali
17,evanston_dad,Rather Boring Bio of Muhammad Ali,6,26 July 2010,"Michael Mann is a very hit-and-miss director for me. His movies either blow me out of the water (""The Insider,"" ""Heat""), or they leave me cold (""Miami Vice,"" ""Public Enemies""). Unfortunately, ""Ali"" belongs to the latter category.Mann's filmmaking is always very assured, so when his movies miss, I'm never exactly sure why. There's just something boring about ""Ali."" It tells Muhammad Ali's story, and it does so with what could be mistaken for passion, but it just felt rote and lifeless to me, and far too long.Will Smith and Jon Voight were honored with Academy Award nominations for playing Ali and Howard Cosell, respectively, but clearly I'm not the only one to be underwhelmed by the film, as it bombed with audiences and couldn't even crack 7.0 here at IMDb.Grade: B-",Ali
18,anaconda-40658,Will Smith's Bout.,4,15 March 2016,"Ali (2001): Dir: Michael Mann / Cast: Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, Mykelti Williamson, Mario Van Peeples: Boxing film is poorly edited, written and directed by Michael Mann who made the intriguing suspense drama The Insider. Cassius Clay became one of the biggest names in boxing history and certainly a celebrated champion. He switched from Christianity to Muslim resulting in a name change to Mahammad Ali. Highlights includes bouts with Sonny Lipton, Joe Fraser, and a bout in Africa against George Foreman. Unfocused with Ali being drafted and arrested for refusing induction; his brother shot; bad marriages. Many of the shots do not match. The nightclub singers footage is also unnecessary. Boxing footage is exhilarating with a fantastic performance by Will Smith as Ali. Smith holds strong and is the best aspect of the film but Ali deserves a tighter screenplay as oppose to the laziness scribbled down for the screenplay. Jon Voight plays a promoter in what is a fine effort but a one note role. Jamie Foxx seems out of place as Ali's brother, and the footage comes across as distracting. Cameo by Mykelti Williamson as fight promoter Don King but none of it is inspiring or worthy of our attention span. Mario Van Peeples also makes an appearance as the infamous Malcolm X, but again, more would be better. Fine attempt is down for the count. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Ali
19,namashi_1,A Well-Acted Film!,7,19 November 2011,"Boxing Legend Muhammad Ali's life unfolds in 'Ali'. Directed by Michael Mann, this biopic, which failed at the box office, actually deserves a watch, for the fine performances it offers, along-with commendable direction by Mann. 'Ali' tells the story of Muhammad Ali, played by Will Smith, from 1964 to 1974, featuring his capture as of the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston, his conversion to Islam, criticism of the Vietnam War, banishment from boxing, his return to fight Joe Frazier in 1971, and, lastly, his reclaiming the title from George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle fight of 1974. 'Ali' is engaging in parts, not in totality. Reason? The Erratic Screenplay, that sometimes gives it's icon his due, while sometimes, backlashes him with overly-long scenes. Screenplay by Eric Roth, Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson & Mann himself, works in parts. It definitely could've been tighter & even shorter. Mann's direction, on the other-hand, is commendable, as always. The Boxing Sequences are stunning, while the Cinematography & Editing, are crisp. Make-Up, is marvelous. Performance-Wise: Will Smith as Muhammad Ali, is damn impressive. The actor never loses focus & pays tribute to the ring-legend. Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, is first-rate, although, he is hardly recognizable, thanks to the terrificly done make-up. Jamie Foxx is good. Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, is sincere. Ron Silver & Jeffrey Wright are passable. Jada Pinkett Smith & Mykelti Williamson support well. Others fill the bill.On the whole, 'Ali' isn't flawless, but well-acted & nicely executed, nevertheless.",Ali
20,JamesHitchcock,A Narrow Win on Points Rather than a Knockout,6,5 October 2005,"Although biopics are obviously based on fact, they often have a similar structure to cinematic works of fiction. This is because the makers of such films generally start with a fixed view their of subject and select episodes from his or her life in order to build them into a coherent narrative which will illustrate their particular viewpoint. Thus Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is constructed as the story of how a brilliant man overcame adversity (in this case a crippling mental illness) and the Stephen Fry ""Wilde"" is presented as a classic Aristotelian tragedy of a great man brought down by a flaw in his character.""Ali"", like those two films, is deliberately constructed to fit an established narrative pattern, the rise, fall and rise again of a champion. It starts with Muhammad Ali's fight against Sonny Liston in 1964, at a time when he was still known as Cassius Clay, which first brought him the world heavyweight title, and ends with the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle"" in Kinshasa in 1974 in which Ali reclaimed the title from George Foreman. In between it details his reign as heavyweight champion, his conversion to Islam, his involvement in the civil rights movement, his opposition to the Vietnam War, which led to his being stripped of the title when he refused to be drafted into the US Army, and his unsuccessful attempt to regain the title from Joe Frazier.During his career, particularly during its first half in the sixties, Ali was a highly controversial character, arousing admiration and dislike in roughly equal proportions. He was admired for his victories in the boxing ring and the stylish way in which he achieved them, relying on skill and tactics rather than on brute power, unlike some of his opponents. He was also admired for the moral courage he showed in his opposition to racism and to American involvement in Vietnam. He was, however, also disliked, and not merely by racists or by those who opposed his political views. Ali's playboy lifestyle sat uncomfortably with his declared religious views, and his constant boasting about his prowess and his taunting and belittling of his opponents struck many as arrogant and unsportsmanlike, even as a deliberate psychological ploy to try and unsettle them. Despite Ali's support of the civil rights cause, many of his most venomous outbursts were aimed not at the white establishment but at his mainly black opponents. It was notable that many of those whom he derided as ""ugly"", such as Liston, Frazier and Foreman, had darker skins than he himself did. He possibly aroused public interest in boxing more than any other champion, but for all those who eagerly watched his fights to witness his boxing skills, there were also those who watched in the hope (generally disappointed) of seeing a braggart humbled.Although the film does show some of Ali's rants at the expense of Liston and Foreman, presenting them as a bit of harmless fun, it is too much of a hagiography to explore the contradictions in his character in any depth. The film is, in fact, in many ways unsatisfactory, although none of this is the fault of its star, Will Smith, who does a very good impersonation of Ali, making you believe that you are watching the man himself. (There is another good performance from Jon Voight as the commentator Howard Cosell). The film is too long and, paradoxically, at the same time incomplete. We get nearly three hours concentrating on the decade 1964-74. I think that the film-makers were right to end the film with Ali's victory over Foreman- details of his second reign as world champion in the late seventies and of his post-retirement decline into ill-health would have added little to the story that they wanted to tell- but it was a mistake to omit details of his early life before 1964. Growing up in the American South in the forties and fifties, the young Cassius Clay must have experienced prejudice and discrimination on a daily basis. We learn a lot about Ali's anger at the system and about his involvement in the civil rights struggle, but we do not see what gave rise to that anger or what made that struggle necessary in the first place. The boxing scenes are fairly realistic, although they lack the raw power that Martin Scorsese was able to bring out in another boxing biopic, ""Raging Bull"", an altogether better film.Despite this, I found the film watchable; for all his flaws, Ali was a fascinating personality, and it would have been difficult to make a really bad film about him. This one was enjoyable and informative, but could have been better. A narrow win on points rather than a knockout. 6/10",Ali
21,blanbrn,Well done sports drama biography of a historical legend in and out of the ring.,9,9 February 2016,"""Ali"" is more than just a boxing movie about perhaps the greatest heavyweight champ to have ever lived, it's also a personal historic drama about the man's life of struggle to find who he was in and outside of the ring. Actor Will Smith is true to form in his performance as Ali and Jon Voight is memorable as sports broadcasting announcer Howard Cosell, as their screen chemistry is in fine form and plus the boxing action shown seemed real and action packed.The film follows over a ten year period with Muhammad Ali winning the title at a young age upsetting Sonny Liston, and then his first love is played just fine by Will Smith's real life wife Jada Pinkett Smith, as their would be many loves and ladies in Ali's life. Then the film is a showcase about Ali's struggles to accept and reveal his real religion that being Islam. And this even causes him to stand up and speak out against the war and say no to a draft. And to complicate matters it's a legal conviction and a fist from Joe Frazier that sends Ali spinning for awhile. Yet thru faith and work all turns around for Ali.Then it's on to ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" against the now champ young and big powerful George Foreman in ""Zaire"" which as all knows turns out to be the defining moment for Ali's life in and out of the boxing ring. Overall well done film that's long with facts and drama it shows that a legend of sports can be historic for the way he fought in and out of the ring as Ali was a fighter on all matters of belief and life.",Ali
22,MovieAddict2016,Plays too much like a documentary and not a film,5,22 August 2005,"""Ali"" was one of those hugely-hyped films that just kind of fizzled out once it had been released. So much was built up around its release: Will Smith and all his training he endured to take on the role of Muhammad Ali, director Michael Mann's struggle to get the film made, and of course the very idea of a film bio being made of boxing's most famous legend.The first disappointment is Smith. I like him and think he's a good actor, but he's out of his league here. For starters, he doesn't look like Ali. He has some of the movements and physical expressions down pat, but he doesn't talk like him, look like him, or have the same presence as him.The second disappointment is writer-director Michael Mann. Here's a guy with a great career of films (from ""Manhunter"" to ""Heat"") who writes a lazy script and abandons his usual directorial style for a standard TV-drama biopic narrative. It's a huge disappointment.The rest of the cast are all pretty good - Jamie Foxx, Will's wife Jada-Pinkett, Jon Voight and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X all acceptable in their roles (although something tells me the inclusion of Jada-Pinkett was unnecessary and just a way of Will getting his wife into the movie) - but overall the film's hugest blunder is its choice of narrative, which feels too much like any daytime drama bio-pic and less like a movie.There's no connection, no feelings, no excitement - resulting in one of the most disappointing films in recent memory.",Ali
23,disdressed12,a career performance by Will Smith(too bad the movie is sub standard),6,25 May 2007,"this film about Muhammad Ali is a disappointing effort.it's over long,boring at times and lacking much intensity.the movie is all flash and no substance.Will Smith though is very brilliant in the title role.he inhabits Ali's body and soul.the problem is,the movie is not worthy of his huge talent.it does have its moments,but really it has an empty incomplete feel to it.after it was over,i was left unsatisfied.this movie should have been great,but there's something missing.though Smith exudes heart,soul and intensity ,the movie has neither.i had such high hopes for this one.the irony of it all,is this may well be Smith's greatest performance so far,that i have witnessed.he really put on an acting clinic.even though the movie fails to impress,i recommend for those that want to see what real acting is.as a result,i give ""Ali"" 6/10",Ali
24,sddavis63,A Major Disappointment,3,19 November 2002,"To give credit where credit is due I want to start off with mentioning the fine performances in this movie. Will Smith was quite convincing as Muhammad Ali. It must be difficult and somewhat intimidating to play a legend who is still alive, but he managed to get both the look and the voice down quite well. Stealing the show, however (and in a relatively limited role) was Jon Voight as Howard Cosell. Voight really WAS Cosell in this movie. Everything about him screamed Cosell. It was almost scary, in fact - a Cosell resurrection. (Which, come to think of it wouldn't be a bad thing. I really miss Howard.) Anyway, I've only seen bits and pieces of ""Monday Night Mayhem"" and I'm not sure who played Cosell there, but Voight beat him mercilessly in the part, whoever he was. Watch ""Ali"" just for Jon Voight!Unfortunately, I thought the story itself was weak and badly organized. There was no flow to it; no continuity. It was like a series of  vignettes of Ali's life (Ali fights Liston; Ali converts to Islam; Ali refuses induction; and so on and so forth) but without any strong sense of connection between them. And I guess the second problem is that it wasn't about Ali's life. The movie starts with Ali winning the title against Sonny Liston in 1964 and ends with him winning the title back against George Foreman in 1974. So it's 10 years of Ali's life, and this lack of historical context bothered me a bit. What were his younger years like? The plot outline here at IMBD says ""A biography of sports legend, Muhammad Ali, from his early days to his days in the ring."" Huh? What early days? It starts with his title fight against Liston! You wouldn't have a clue from watching this movie, for example, that Cassius Clay was a gold medalist from the 1960 Rome Olympics. It was never mentioned. And what of his sadder later years? After winning the title back against Foreman he had a couple of good years and some good fights (notably the rematch with Joe Frazier) but it's not mentioned. And what an interesting study could have been done of a problem many athletes have giving up the limelight. I mean, from about 1976 on Ali was fading badly, won some questionable decisions based on his name rather than his performance in the ring, and fought a series of relative unknowns (anyone remember Alfredo Evangelista?) because he knew he couldn't beat the serious contenders (finally losing to Leon Spinks in 1978 - and yes winning the title back again in a rematch later that year.) Then, ill fated comeback attempts; the battle with Parkinson's. All left out, except for a brief note at the end of the movie that Ali lost and regained the title in 1978. I think a look at his earlier and especially his later years would have made this a far more compelling movie.As it is if one word could sum up my thought about this it would be ""disappointing.""3/10 (basically a credit to Smith and Voight. Without them it would have been lower.)",Ali
25,FeastMode,my notes,3,24 July 2019,"I only watched this because i know very little about the life of muhammad ali, so i figured it might be interesting. while he and his life are interesting, the movie is not. it is uselessly long and ridiculously boring. so many long extensive scenes where nothing happens. the fights were nothing special. the acting was good. (1 viewing)",Ali
26,ElMaruecan82,"A narrative failure, and of the saddening kind...",6,5 June 2017,"It doesn't take a fan to know that the aura of Muhammad Ali transcended the limits of the ring, the limits of his country the limits of his era.Ali wasn't just a boxer, he was an entertainer, a poet, a man who literally contextualized his time with actions such as joining the Nation of Islam, befriending Malcolm X, refusing to fight in Vietnam because no Vietcong ever threw a N-word at him, he traded his glory for courage, earning even more glory over the long haul. The historical magnitude of a legend like Ali is so powerful that a biopic was indeed overdue, and in 2001, when it was announced that the story of Ali was to be released, that the greatest boxer of all-time would be played by Will Smith, the most flamboyant and charismatic of the then-young actors, and directed by Michael Mann, known for his complex, methodic but ultimately rewarding directing, ""Ali"" was expected to be a knockout. Alas, it wasn't.The film disappointed the fans who expected new insights about their hero and the non-fans who thought they would learn one thing or two about the legend: how and why did he convert to Islam? Was his 'arrogance' genuine or was it just an act? How much hardship and humiliations did he undergo as a kid to be so proud and eloquent about his achieved greatness? How did Ali deal with the loss of the title and the years of ban on a personal level? Or simply, how about his private life, what kind of a husband or a father he was? The film provides shades of answers but Ali is still a mystery at the end. We don't know more about him and we might even question the things we took for granted. And the weaknesses aren't just on the content but the form, too. How can a film that deals with a larger-than-life and enthusiastic personality, played by a magnetic actor, and directed by a competent director be so frustratingly flat... and even, dull.I read that it was the Academy Award nomination for ""The Insider"" that earned Michael Mann the project. Comparing the editing of ""The Insider"" and ""Ali"", I still scratch my head, Mann had a simpler story to tell in the sense that the focus was one man, but as if he's used to deal with multi-character driven stories, ""Heat"" being another remarkable example, Mann seems only able to indulge to many long silent scenes punctuated by elements of context, generally music, as if he was sure that the audience will always be receptive to the shots of Ali running with a puzzled expression, Ali looking sad and thoughtful. These fillers are so numerous that even the joyful moments, supposed to be the high points of his life, don't elicit the enthusiastic responses they aim for. When Ali defeats Sonny Liston and shouts that he ""shook out the world"", I didn't feel the goose bumps from the original footage, I was just glad that needlessly detailed game ended.This feeling is even more frustrating because Will Smith gave the performance of a lifetime, you can tell he pulled a 'Raging Bull' in his characterization and at the end, you could almost feel you had the young Ali on screen, the other actors did good, Jon Voight, unrecognizable behind his Howard Cosell mask would earn an Oscar-nomination along with Smith and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown did justice to the story. But Foxx would later pair up with Mann for the most superior and better-prepared ""Collateral"", ""Ali"" seemed to have been made in a rush, with a lack of preparation that is baffling from Mann. I liked Ebert's comment that the film features many scenes that looks like ready to get a few cuts in an editing room. I don't know how long did the running across Zaire took place, but did they really expect us to be enjoying it, it was so long that even when the Fight of the Century started, I was exhausted already.Will Smith immersed himself into his character; he gained weight, trained, and was ready to take real hits. I don't think Mann put himself in the same mindset, he should have seen ""Raging Bull"" to check how you can make a terrific and exciting boxing game that lasts less than five minutes, he should have watched (or watched again) the remarkable documentaries about Ali, including ""When We Were Kings"" to try to extract from them the substantial elements about African-American conscience. He should have watched ""Malcolm X"" to see what a good biopic is, that you can make a long film that doesn't feel long, or to realize that the 'Malcolm X' part didn't need to drag on because it would never equal Spike Lee's. The film focuses on 1964-1974, the most defining chapters of Ali's life, but we could have earlier glimpses of his past to understand him instead of a second retread of Malcolm X' final years.Again, Mann is a terrific director but for some reason, he wasn't ready for ""Ali"", and my guess is that Spike Lee would have been a more interesting choice, he would probably have focused on the aura and persona of Ali in a more exciting and engaging way. That's what the fans expected, an intimate view on the champ, and this is why the film flopped, I could see the crowds in the theaters when the film was released but it didn't last, bad word of mouth, as simple as that. Foxx would later play in Ray Charles' biopic and if ""Ali"" was half the film ""Ray"" or ""Malcolm X"" or half any other Mann's film, it could have been something. A flop, that's what it is, and of the puzzling kind, at that.",Ali
27,paul2001sw-1,"Come back Rocky, all is forgiven!",6,26 October 2005,"Muhammed Ali was the best boxer of his generation, a scurrilous and incisive wit, and a black activist and role model. Stripped of his title after refusing to fight in Vietnam, and subsequently beaten on his return to the ring, he went on to reclaim his world titles, before retiring and (very probably as a direct result of his long career) developing a form of Parkinson's disease. With such a rich biography, a film of Ali's life should by rights be among ""the greatest"" of movies, but sadly, 'Ali' has been made by Michael Mann, a director whose work is both middlebrow and pretentious: it always seems to be making a point about saying something, without actually saying very much at all. For this film, Mann has chosen to construct a collage of scenes from Ali's life, set to music, rather than to build a conventional narrative. It's an odd approach: to those utterly unfamiliar with the events of Ali's life, I suspect the film would seem baffling: yet there's little in the way of deep insight into Ali's character to compensate. Indeed, while Will Smith, an actor who usually features in comic movie, shows (and not for the first time) that he can play straight, in his hands Ali is (whisper is softly) almost a little dull: the playful menace of the original is mimicked but not matched.And some of Mann's decisions I just don't understand. The film begins, for example, with a handful of dialogue-free scenes prior to showing us Ali's first big fight. The fight thus begins before the film has had a chance to induce any sort of emotional attachment to the character. And the stylised representation of the fighting itself comprises the most boring representation of boxing on screen that I have ever seen. Personally, I'm no great fan of the sport, but there's a visceral quality in evidence when you watch any real fight on television that just isn't conveyed here. In part, this is because Mann seems determined to eschew narrative potential at all times, as if to ensure his film is never a sporting melodrama, even when he is reconstructing exactly such an event in real life. For example: in Sylvester Stallone's film 'Rocky', hardly a classic of cinema, a key element of the fight scenes is the depiction of the ring girls, who parade with the number of each round before it begins. They naturally add to the narrative tension for the audience, pacing us through the fight. In the final fight shown in 'Ali' (the famous Ali-Foreman encounter in Zaire), we also see the ring girls: but they hold their numbers off camera, so we have no idea how long the fight has to go. If unintentional, his would be so incompetent I can only assume it is deliberate; but rather baffling, nonetheless. By contrast, the purpose of using uplifting, ""spiritual"" African music to accompany the Zairean scenes is, on the other hand, crassly obvious. The film thus seems to aspire to force us to assign a certain higher meaning to the events it depicts; yet has no interest in milking the basic story for its innate drama. Instead of showing us how things were, and leaving us to ponder why Ali became an icon, the film serves us a legendary, but vaguely defined, hero. The failure to even mention Ali's later suffering (in spite of a ""what happened next"" caption at the end of the film) seems cowardly and wrong.For all that, Ali's story remains mesmerising. But this film made me want to watch a proper documentary instead.",Ali
28,lesleyharris30,"One of Will Smiths Finest Performances,",8,16 April 2014,"Ali is a brilliant movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.Will Smith does a fantastic job portraying boxing legend Muhammed Ali and was without a doubt perfect casting,I honestly didn't think a character like this would suit him,even though he is without a doubt one of my favourite actors of all time,I just thought his personality didn't seem like one that could pull off playing Muhammed Ali,but I was wrong,I should never have doubted him,he clearly studied this mans history and really became him,it is really hard to believe watching this movie that that is actually Will Smith.I was also concerned that there would be too many fight scenes and not enough story development,but that also was not a problem,there were several fight scenes,but they were put in at very necessary times and were great while they lasted.Ali is a fantastic movie tad to would recommend to all fans of Will Smith and biography films.Biography of the famous boxing champion Muhammed Ali (Will Smith) as we look at the early beginnings of his career,forward to his rising popularity.Best Performance: Will Smith Worst Performance: Mykelti Williamson",Ali
29,Irishchatter,I don't think Will Smith is the best actor to play as Ali...,3,7 September 2016,"I'm not saying he's the worst actor out there but, he just didn't seem to fit the look of the real Mohammad Ali. I think he seemed to be more himself than Ali and plus, he doesn't fully look like Ali. They really should've concentrated and been more careful on the casting side while they were making this movie.Now I have to say, the boxing scenes were really well done but what puts me off was just the bad casting. Also I even didn't think Jamie Foxx should've acted as Ali's trainer, Drew Bundini Brown. He just acted too chilled just like himself but with this serious role, he just didn't seem to be prepared to be encouraging type. Thankfully I didn't watch the whole movie because honestly, it just bored me to tears. Its sad that the real Ali left us this year with Parkinson's disease. RIP Ali (The Greatest) <3",Ali
30,vincentlynch-moonoi,50-50,6,31 May 2013,"To me, there are two separate things to review here: the film-story and the acting.In terms of the film-story, I really disliked it. You might ask how can that be since it's a bio-pic, and a fairly accurate one, at that. The problem for me was the way the film was fashioned, rather than a cohesive story line, it seemed more like a series of vignettes loosely tied together, with the viewer left to draw some conclusions. I really disliked it, and if it were not for the strength of the performances, I would have turned the over-long movie off rather quickly.But, the performance are terrific. The strongest, in my view, is actually that of Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X; perhaps the best performance of his career, though it ends (with Malcolm X's death) fairly early in the movie. But there is no denying that Will Smith's portrayal of Mohammad Ali is stunning; perhaps the best of his career. The look is ""okay"", but the voice mannerisms are startlingly accurate.There are issues with Jon Voight as Howard Cosell. I think his performance is quite good, but the makeup is almost laughable.The other supporting actors do their jobs well, though none stand out. I include in that comment Jamie Foxx...nothing notable there; his best role as Ray Charles a while off.Of course, a legitimate question is whether this is simply a movie that glorifies Ali. I don't think so. It portrays him as an interesting mix of a man who is, perhaps, a bit intellectual, but not well-educated. Who had less than a healthy respect for women (particularly his wives). But, ironically, also a man who understands dignity.The film ends with the win over George Foreman, so it's an incomplete biography.Not something I'd want to watch a third time.",Ali
31,slightlymad22,Will Smith Should Have Won The Oscar,9,9 December 2016,"Plot In A Paragraph: Focusing on sports legend Mohammad Ali during the years 1964 to 1974.For this reviewer, Ali was overlooked and undervalued at the time of its release. As despite Will Smith's star power, the movie didn't hit the $100 million mark at the box office, a rarity for a Smith lead movie in those days!! (As even Wild Wild West crosses the $100 million barrier) and despite two Oscar nominations, I feel it was ignored, and should have had more.THE FIRST 10 minutes of Ali are great!! Time hopping and covering a lot of ground all at once. Set to the vocal delight of Sam Cooke, we see Cassius Clay, Jr. taking a night time run being harassed by a pair of cops, then he's a child, walking toward the ""coloreds only"" section of a bus, then we cut back to Clay in the gym on the speed bag, then back to the child watching his father paint a blonde haired, blue eyes Jesus, before we get to the the weigh-in with Sonny Liston, where he delivers his ""float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"" line, dominating proceedings and sparring with reporter's. It is probably the best opening 20 minutes to any Mann directed movie. I think it was a wise decision to focus on the years the movie does as we see him become champ by defeating Liston, deepen his commitment to Islam, change his name from Cassius Clay to Mohammed Ali, lose the title by refusing induction into the army, and regain the title in the rumble in the jungle against George Forman.As a sports biopic, it's light on action, and it actually devoted as much time (if not more) on what happens before and after the fights, as what it does on the fights. It's not a feel good flick either, the movie doesn't fall into a lot of the trappings of this type of movie, and at times, it's not afraid of showing Ali in an unflattering light. His troubled relationships with his wives, father and his struggles with the Muslim community are all covered in detail. Which could explain its lack of success at the box office upon release.Will Smith is amazing here!! In Mann, he found a director who could finally help him deliver a performance nobody thought he had in him. Surprisingly the movie doesn't play to Smith's strong suits, such as his comic timing or his fast talking, quick with a one liner persona, that wasn't so different from Ali's. Instead we get a thoughtful, dialled in dramatic performance that I think should have won him the Oscar that year. I totally forge I'm watching Smith, and all I see is Ali. For me it seems the bigger the star, the better the performance Mann seems to get. The full movie is ridiculously well cast. Jon Voight, (an actor I adore, and was also nominated, and again I think should have won) or his performance as Howard Cosell. Jamie Foxx, Ron Silver and Jeffrey Wright It's not perfect, it could use a bit of editing to sort out some pacing issues, things such as the whole Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and Martin Luthor King (LeVar Burton) subplots could have gone. Some bits seem drawn out, whilst others seem rushed over. Like when he goes for a morning run in Zaire, it feels like he is running longer than Forest Gump did!! Ali grossed $58 million to end the year the 41st highest grossing movie of 2001.I'd rate the movie an 8/10, but I'm giving an extra point for Smith's performance.",Ali

33,zkonedog,I Want This Movie To Be So Much Better Than It Is,4,2 March 2017,"The life of Muhammad Ali (both inside and outside the ring) is one of the most fascinating in all of sports or US history. At times, this movie captures those moments. Sadly, it doesn't catch nearly enough of them, focuses on the wrong things, and ends up a bloated, ponderous exercise in preachy film-making.For a basic plot summary, ""Ali"" opens with Cassius Clay (Will Smith) defeating Sonny Liston (Michael Bentt) to become the boxing heavyweight champion of the world. Shortly after this event, Clay falls in the Muslim Brotherhood, befriending such figures as Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) & Herbert Muhammad (Barry Shabaka Henley). He also begins a romantic relationship with Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith) that is often tumultuous due to Ali's interpretations of the Muslim faith. Entering the prime of his fighting career, Ali is then drafted into the Vietnam War, which he refuses to participate in. As a result, he is stripped of his boxing license and not even able to leave the country. After years of fighting the U.S. government, Ali is finally able to be reinstated, where he gets the ""Fight of the Century"" with Joe Frazier (James Toney) and then the ""Rumble In The Jungle"" against George Foreman (Charles Shufford).Judged purely on film-making and directing, ""Ali"" isn't even a three-star effort. It is overly preachy when it comes to the ""political stuff"", and director Michael Mann uses such a weird style. About every 20 minutes or so, there is an extended musical sequence, all of which (besides maybe the opening one) only serve to grind the intensity of the film to a complete halt. Every time the action starts to progress again...it's back to another strange interlude.There are two other problems with the film that are quite glaring:1. There is nothing (at least in terms of style) that director Mann really gets right during the film. The political side of things is definitely important to the Ali story, but in this case it is preachy and over-the-top. Then, when it comes to the boxing fare, there are too many historical inaccuracies to consider even those scenes a true success. Maybe those who know nothing about Ali won't care, but those who have a little background will be appalled to hearing Ali's famous poem used before the Frazier fight instead of Liston, or seeing Ali & Frazier getting buddy-buddy with each other before their fight (in reality, Frazier couldn't stand Ali until very late in his life when some amends were made).2. For a movie titled ""Ali"", this should have focused on the entirety of Ali's life. That would have made for a much better story. Ali had a very interesting childhood, and also had some genre- defining moments late in his life as well. Those areas weren't even sniffed in this adaptation, which is a shame, as the film instead to give so much valuable time to the political/religious side of things.I'm sure by now you are probably wondering why I can even give this film three stars. Well, the main reason is because Will Smith turns in perhaps the greatest acting performance I have ever seen...bar none. He IS Ali in this picture, plain and simple. The times (sadly rare as they are) where Smith is given the chance to rant and rave like Ali once did are easily the best parts of the film. His interactions with Howard Cosell (played by Jon Voight) are also special.Also, the fight scenes are probably the most well-done boxing action I've even seen in a film. The fights manage to be both dramatic and realistic at the same time, which is no easy task in such a violent (yet also very tactical) sport.Overall, though, ""Ali"" is first and foremost a disappointment. Even a three-star rating probably holds some personal bias of how much I simply WANT the film to be better than it is. While Smith's iconic Ali performance will certainly stand for ages, it's sad that it has to be surrounded by such sloppy film-making. I would suggest ""When We Were Kings"" or ""Facing Ali"" for a much better nod to Ali's unique career and culture-defining role in American society.",Ali
34,poe426,Some memorable moments...,4,21 May 2002,"The odds were a million to one (or thereabouts) when challenger Cassius Clay climbed into the ring against heavyweight champion of the world Sonny Liston in 1964. Liston had wrested the title from Floyd Patterson in 60 seconds flat; the rematch lasted only moments longer. Clay had been floored by the Brit, Henry Cooper, en route to a tko win. (There's an old joke in boxing: If you wanted to take all of the British heavyweights in the world and lay them end to end from here to the moon... you probably could.) The oddsmakers had already measured Clay for a pine box by the night of the fight. So what does he do? He beats the daylights out of one of the most fearsome heavyweight champions of all time, using lateral movement (a study in perpetual motion, if ever there was one) and a piston-like left jab that cut the brutish champion and eventually began to buckle his knees. Clay even went so far as to taunt his opponent throughout the bout. It was one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight boxing history. The foregoing information is nowhere to be gleaned in ALI. By omitting these facts, Michael Mann does his movie (and his audience) a great disservice. He actually undercuts the drama by failing to build suspense. On the plus side, his use of professional boxers in all of the major fight scenes is to be commended: this lends the film a verisimilitude lacking in most ""boxing movies."" The punch-for-punch recreation of some of the most memorable moments from some of the 20th century's greatest fights is likewise laudable. (The fidelity to the fisticuffs alone makes this a must-see for fight fans.) Certainly there are few scenes in the history of fight films as powerful as the slo-mo shot of ""Sonny Liston"" spitting out his mouthpiece after his drubbing at the hands of his brash challenger.A bit of narration, here and there, could've added immeasurably to the fight scenes; could've given non-boxing fans unfamiliar with the history of The Game something tangible to hold on to. Nor would it have hurt to have actually shown the destruction of both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton by George ""Thunderfist"" Foreman. The significance would've been clear, even to a non-fan, of the four-round elimination of the only two men to have beaten Ali up to that time. (Frazier had battled Ali toe-to-toe for a total of 27 rounds, Norton 24, without so much as a handful of points separating them. Frazier fell in 2 brutal rounds to Foreman- losing his coveted heavyweight title in the process- and Norton, who'd broken Ali's jaw, went in two as well. How could anyone have expected Ali to beat Foreman and regain the title? The notion at that time was nothing less than preposterous!) (Footnote: Consider this, as well: Mike Tyson, hailed by many as the greatest thing since bottled milk, pulled out of a big payday with the geriatric George Foreman. Tyson understood something that a lot of people did not: that even an over-the-hill George Foreman still had the power to separate a champion from his title, as he later showed. Not that it mattered, as Tyson was kayoed by Buster Douglas, the man he opted to face in lieu of Foreman.)There are moments of great beauty in this film, and any true boxing fan needs to see it (if only for the beautifully-choreographed fight scenes, which put to shame the lame-brained antics in the ROCKY movies), but anyone who doesn't follow The Sweet Science may find themselves outside looking in.",Ali
35,johnnyboyz,"Proudly takes its place in whatever Hall of Fame there might be for boxing films, as Mann studiously pays tribute to the life and times of ""The Greatest"".",7,3 December 2010,"One of the more famous, more accomplished, more recognisable names and faces in the history of any sport is the subject of Michael Mann's 2001 film entitled Ali. Muhammad Ali was a champion, for that there can be little debate; often when he steps out into the ring whenever it is he does in the film, we do not debate as to whether he might win his fight or not, rather, Mann is more interested in getting to the bottom of a famous man with some often radical views on the world around him: the drama is outside of the ring, not inside. Where the film is a deceptive formulaic piece building and building to a final showdown with which it climaxes, it resembles more-so a humanistic and humbling dramatisation of Ali's often rocky relationships over the years with family members; particular women; business cohorts and the American government. Mann doesn't sugar-coat his depiction of the man; at times in the film, Ali will come across as arrogant; aggressive and rather unkind whereas at others he is victimised by those only seemingly more powerful than he is, but never for once do we doubt the character's ability and head-strong confidence that he has in himself. By the time the famous Zaire based Rumble in the Jungle fight has arrived and Ali is there doing his thing with both his mouth and his fists, we've long since jumped on board and are with him every step of the way.Will Smith does the job of incarnating Muhammad Ali, and does the job stupendously. The film will begin with the man jogging in a drab, cold and rather metallic locale early on in the day. His running activity is inter-cut with a singer on a stage, somebody whipping the crowd into a frenzy and quite clearly being 'at one' with both their surroundings and what they're doing for a living. As the opening progresses, all the activity becomes inter-cut with one of Ali's knockout blows and a similar sense of the boxing ring being Ali's stage upon which he does the equivalent of the singer in relation to the crowd and the 'at oneness' with everything is effectively established. The inaudible hush of a crowd greets us prior to his first fight, some thumping electronic music without lyrics overlying for Ali and his opponent's entrances to the ring. The audience get what they came for; we, as purveyors of a piece of cinema, witness a bringing to life of one of Ali's fights and what it may have been like prior from the perspective of the man himself. All of it carries a feel of cinema, a cinematic charge; where the patrons and lines up in their seats ready for the next slice of spectacle that is Ali's next fight, we are primed and ready for Mann's detailed and involving exploration.Where Ali is a champion fighter and we already know comes the finer details some audience members may not already be informed of: namely, his fights outside of the ring. Mann appears to be aware of Ali as a name even to those uninformed to boxing; laying on fight after fight establishing how superior Ali was to everybody else in his sport would have been futile: the greatest battles Ali had in his life were with family members and those running the nation in which he lived. What he was seemingly fighting for was identity, not the chunks of money that come with boxing matches; what it was he was precisely fighting against appears in the guise of racism, not another faceless boxer in the other corner. The film knows this is more interesting, Mann knows this is more interesting; an eventual fight with Sonny Lister far shorter following the plunging of us into the world of a boxer and what it must feel like before every match you're preparing to go out and partake in.The film's tone is cold; calculated and quite colourless, even distant. We do not necessarily feel alienated from Ali as much as he himself felt alienated from most of those whom he dealt with. His converting to Islam is much to his father's, who's a Christian preacher, dismay; his resisting of the draft to Vietnam for The War on behalf of the U.S. Government leads to widespread annoyances and frustrations on their behalf and his disconnected feel toward the rest of society as fellow African-Americans figures in social and political upheaval are assassinated resonate painfully. A revealing scene later on sees his attitudes and outspoken nature eventually coming to disrupt and, we feel, alienate him from his boxing promoter Don King (Williamson), who was in full flow during a press conference. We felt he was good friends with King, the rapport they shared was amusing and the bouncing off of one another which they appeared to be able to manage was evidently there; the 'turning' on King, indeed everybody in the room bar Angelo (Silver) his faithful trainer, is telling and quite chilling in a way that arrives out of the blue.Was there something about the cameras that wound Ali up? Was it the bustle of the sheer amounts of people at the weigh-ins which set him off? One scene sees him share the front of an automobile with the very man he'll come to fight in a hugely publicised fight; their exchange is anonymous and much calmer, even measured. They speak to one another as two men away from everyone and everything else in what is a direct exchange involving Ali that goes against the majority of what we're provided, but remains equally fascinating despite this sense of polar-opposition within the premise of the situation. Smith is supported by a wonderful performance by Jon Voight, playing true to life sportscast journalist Howard Cosell in what is one of those rare post-Mission: Impossible Jon Voight films that are worth sitting through, as Michael Mann produces another addition to his impressive repertoire.",Ali
36,Captain_Couth,"Overrated and flawed remake of ""The Greatest"".",5,20 August 2005,"Ali (2001) was an overrated film by Michael Mann. Will Smith was not right for the role of Ali, despite what people say. He just didn't have the aura of ""The Greatest"". I don't think that they should make bio-pics on people who are still alive. You have to cater to certain crowds, try not to offend the living and tip toe around facts and issues. With that said, I felt that the real star of this movie was Jamie Foxx. He should real acting talent in this movie as the infamous Drew ""Bundini"" Brown. His performance alone is worth a glimpse at this other wise overrated film. I'd recommend THE GREATEST instead of this movie. At least you get to see Muhammed Ali and his real circle of friends act their parts instead of this revisionist tripe.Mediocre, worth a viewing though. I have one questioned I would like to have answered. What ever happened to Ali's brother. If you watched a lot of his interviews and footage of him in public, his brother is always with him. He's rarely shown in this movie. That's not right. Another flaw that I would like to point out.",Ali
37,kevin_robbins,This is a solid character piece that isn't perfect but is worth watching,7,12 October 2021,"Ali (2001) is a movie I recently rewatched on Hulu and tells the tale of Ali's life from his first title fight through his fight at the later stage of his life in Africa versus George Foreman. Ali faced trials and tribulations about religion, politics, his ability to impact society, financial and marital challenges. This movie is directed by Michael Mann (Heat) and stars Will Smith (Hancock), Jamie Fox (Ray), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Mario Van Peebles (Heartbreak Ridge), Jeffrey Wright (Westworld), Jada Pinkett Smith (Menace II Society) and Mykelti Williamson (Forest Gump). The storyline for this movie is fun to watch unfold due to all the characters in and out of Ali's life and how he handled and spoke to them. His lines were as legendary as him. The cast is excellent and I, for one, enjoyed Smith as Ali. The settings, circumstances and backdrops are very well delivered, as are the obstacles he had to overcome. The soundtrack was also very good. This is a solid character piece that isn't perfect but is worth watching. I'd score this a solid 7/10.",Ali
38,dee.reid,"A beautiful man, a beautiful film",10,4 February 2014,"Michael Mann's 2001 biopic of ""The Greatest"" heavyweight boxer that ever lived, Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali (expertly played here by Will Smith, in a rightfully Oscar-nominated performance) is a beautiful film biopic about a beautiful man and a wonderful human being. A controversial and polarizing figure at the peak of his fame, he has earned his spot in sports history and as one of the greatest icons of the Civil Rights Movement. Set over the course of 1964 to 1974 - his peak years - the film covers Muhammad Ali's historic win against Sonny Liston on February 25th 1964, to become the new heavyweight champion of the world; their equally historic rematch a little over a year later on May 25th, 1965 (just as an aside, I found a colorized version of Neil Leifer's famous photograph of Ali standing over the downed Sonny Liston and I have it saved on my computer as a wallpaper); Clay's joining the Nation of Islam and changing his name to ""Muhammad Ali""; his friendships with devoted corner-man Drew ""Bundini"" Brown (Jamie Foxx), Howard Cosell (Jon Voight), trainer Angelo Dundee (the late Ron Silver), photographer Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright) and especially, Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles); his numerous affairs; to his refusal to be drafted into the Armed Services for the growing U.S. war in Vietnam; his comeback in the early 1970s and the slew of historic matches he fought then; and concluding with his historic match in Zaire with George Foreman on October 30th, 1974 (""The Rumble in the Jungle""), to reclaim the title of world heavyweight champion (which he had been stripped of seven years earlier in 1967 over his anti-war stance). And thus we witness a legend being born. Look at me using the word ""historic"" so many times; that's the feeling that Mann's film, and Smith's brilliant portrayal, gets out of the viewer. You're watching history being meticulously recreated by a skilled team of actors and filmmakers. There's a reason why Muhammad Ali's bouts are considered some of the greatest fights the sport of boxing has ever seen: Ali brought a brashness and confidence (some might call it arrogance), and a bravado, and beauty and grace - not to mention a poetic lyricism - to the ring that the sport had never seen before. And the sport of boxing is never likely to ever see a figure as larger-than-life and amazing as the one and only, Muhammad Ali, a.k.a., ""The Greatest.""10/10",Ali
39,meeza,"Stunk like a butterlfy, but 'Mann"" floated like a bee!",6,13 May 2002,"The slogan of the new biopic `Ali' is  forget what you know. After seeing `Ali' it should be more like `forget what you saw'. The film's very lightweight screenplay & dreary story-line made me throw in the towel halfway through the movie. Even though the film is based on one imperative part of Muhammad Ali's courageous life, it did not develop his character in full by showing his childhood and his eventual knockdown of obtaining Parkinson's Disease. However, I must vote a unanimous decision on Director Michael Mann's boxing sequences direction. His one-two punch direction style of slow motion shots and integrating close-ups were a winning combination. Michael's direction `mannerisms' do get you `hooked' into the film a bit. I also do commend Will Smith as Ali who flied as a butterfly with his impersonating dialogue and Jon Voight as Howard Cossell who stung like a bee with his masterful mimicry.  Even though the film as well-acted and its boxing sequences were wonderfully directed, it was the screenplay's deficient technicalities that resulted in  `Ali' losing by a tko (technical knockout). *** Average",Ali
40,jimbo-53-186511,"Solid performances, but there was definitely missed potential here",5,18 January 2015,"The first thing that I am prepared to acknowledge is Will Smith's performance in this film; he was impressive and seemed to really get into the character of Ali. Although his acting was excellent in this film, I don't believe that he should have been Oscar nominated. Likewise, Foxx and several of the supporting characters were also excellent. The film was also well-shot and generally well-made and from a technical aspect it was a fairly polished product. Unfortunately, that's where the praise for this film ends....For me there was far too much time spent on dull aspects of Ali's life such as Ali's various relationships - this aspect of his life got way too much focus and it did, at times, make the film feel like an over-long combination of melodrama and soap opera. At the same time, other potentially more interesting or important areas seemed to either have been ignored or glossed over - there's very little focus on Ali's training, no real mention of his family. Considering the film is over 2 and a half hours long I expected there to be a reasonable amount of boxing and/or training, but we're probably treated to about 30 minutes of boxing (if that) and then 2 hours of melodrama and soap opera. I'm sure a lot of what I describe as 'melodrama' and 'soap opera' type events did occur in Ali's life, but these elements don't make for an entertaining film and should have been kept to a minimum.All of the above isn't helped by the fact that the screenplay felt like it was put together in a haphazard way - the writers would shift from one aspect of Ali's life to another in quick succession barely giving you chance to digest what you've just seen.Although from a technical perspective this film was generally well put together and polished I did feel that the camera work during the boxing matches was pretty poor and as a result I didn't feel quite as involved in the action as I did when I've watched other boxing films. This came as a really big disappointment when you consider how poor many other elements of the film were.Aside from the great performances, there really isn't much else going for this film. My feeling are that it was an over-long soap opera with a bit of boxing thrown in here and there. If you want to see a good boxing biopic then I would recommend Cinderella Man. Muhammad Ali may be the Greatest, but this film certainly isn't.",Ali
41,Agent10,Boxing when it was still a legitimate sport,7,14 June 2002,"While many have put this film down for not being realistic enough, I say, who cares! Michael Mann created a well shot and conceptualized film, especially considering he had a one-sided actor in Will Smith in his lead (who I thought did a respectable job portraying a difficult role). The film overall was excellent, portraying some of the inner insights of a man who most of us had only seen on TV or in the occasional documentary. What really fryed my kettle was the plethora of sports writers (most who were kids during Ali's prime) acting like this wasn't a true representation of one of the most influential people in sports history. What the heck do they know! As a sports writer myself, I know for a fact most sports writers have no idea about what makes a good film. However, I will say this, it is rather interesting to watch a film at four in the morning on Christmas Eve.",Ali
42,Samiam3,Not impressed,5,31 March 2012,"I can't stand when movies take such iconic figures and make them into the kind of people that you don't want to see a movie about. Director Michael Mann takes this individual and strips his life of heart and soul, making him so lacking in character that he's impossible to care for.Muhammad Ali is defined by his ego in this movie, not by his personality or any of the people in his life. Mann's direction makes the film surprisingly distant, slow, poorly edited and devoid of glory. Will Smith has got the talent, it's all there, no question, but there is not much of a character for him to play. The same can be said about the rest of the cast; an ensemble of talented people filling the shoes of such boring underwritten characters. I don't feel like I learned a thing about Muhammed Ali from this motion picture. I'm not impressed.",Ali
43,Spleen,"A fine work, more well-proportioned than it's given credit for being",8,1 August 2002,"The short cut to being counted as a genuine auteur is to use one utterly bizarre, unjustifiable device in each film.  Here, it's the interpolation of digital footage.  Every so often, in the middle of what is otherwise a real film, we'll get some muddy shots that were taken with a digital camera, sometimes shots of the very same kind of thing we'd just seen in 35mm.  It doesn't happen very often (thank goodness).  Why does it happen at all?Let's pretend it doesn't.  All in all what's striking is how WELL the movie has been shot - yea, even with the shaky camerawork, which ruined ""The Insider"" but somehow makes us feel as though we're watching history itself here; besides which, it looks damned good, which is the main thing.I loathe boxing.  I would be delighted to see it vanish off the face of the Earth.  I have to strain to make myself believe that people actually paid to see the fights we see here - quite apart from anything else, how long do they last, half an hour? less? -And yet, I found myself seeing something of what other people see in the sport, as I watched the opening fight sequence and saw, actually SAW, that there IS more to it than two men punching each other until one of them falls over.  (Television footage of actual boxing had never had any such effect on me.)The film sticks to a ten-year segment of Mohammed Ali's life and doesn't step outside it.  ""We see virtually nothing about how he was raised,"" says one writer here, ""what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.""  I chose this quote at random; hundreds of other people have said much the same thing, but unlike them, and unlike the person I've quoted, I see this as the film's primary strength, not a weakness at all. Attempts to tell ""the story"" of so-and-so's life rarely come to anything much.  The sin is always to try to include too much (and likely as not, fail).  Here, we see events which we sense have a cause (they don't feel manufactured), even though we never see what the cause is, and if we don't always know what Ali is thinking or exactly what he is feeling, well, what of it?  We're given enough to go on to make educated guesses.  As with the superb ""Topsy-Turvy"", we're given a SEGMENT of history, which feels as though it's still connected to the pieces of history on either side of it, which nonetheless, when held up to the light like this, turns out to have a satisfying shape of its own.",Ali
44,philip_vanderveken,Even an interesting movie for people who aren't a big fan of boxing,8,10 April 2005,"I know that biopics aren't exactly very popular by most viewers and sometimes I can easily understand why that is. But some of them are certainly worth a watch and ""Ali"" is one of them. As you probably already know this movie is based on the life of Cassius Clay aka Muhammad Ali. The name on itself already rings a bell of course and I guess this is a must see for everybody who loves boxing, but even when you are not a fan of this sport, I'm convinced it has several interesting things to offer. I'll give you a few examples why I think this movie is worth watching.First: The fact that there can be no doubt that Ali was one of the greatest and most colorful boxers, even sportsmen, ever and that this movie really gives a good idea of what kind of a man he was, in the boxing ring as well as in his private life.Second: The acting in this movie is of an outstanding quality. Will Smith must have studied Ali for quite some time, because he really resembles him in the way he talks, acts and moves.Third: This isn't just a movie about boxing. Sure, the boxing is a part of it and it all looks very realistic (Ali's fights have been recreated in a very good way), but it also gives an historically correct idea of what the sixties were like in the USA (religion, politics, the Vietnam war,...) and Zaire, where he fought his famous fight against George Foreman, called 'the Rumble in the Jungle'.All in all this was a very interesting movie that I would recommend to everybody, not only to boxing fans. I'm not a big boxing fan either, but I sure loved this movie. I've always found Ali an intriguing man and that's why I watched this movie, not because of the boxing scenes. Anyway, I give it at least a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10.",Ali
45,valadas,Almost only box,6,11 June 2012,"This could be the story of Cassius Clay aka Muhammad Ali the fighter for Afro-Americans rights. But it turns out to stay almost only as the story of the world heavyweight boxing champion with a few references now and then to his political activity and positions and only through some utterances of his and never through any actions. The movie even ignores all of his life after 1974 (the year when he won the world title again in Zaire) despite the fact that his political and social actions went on. Therefore as a movie about boxing it's a passable one and will certainly be most appreciated by boxing fans but it has enormous gaps in what concerns the personality of Ali mainly in his political,social and religious aspects particularly those which resulted from his early conversion to Islamism. In biographic terms this movie is therefore a disappointment.",Ali

47,baumer,I still don't know anything....,2,24 January 2002,"I remember when this film was being hyped and promoted.  The trailer seemed ubiquitous while perpetually appearing at the beginning of every film I had chosen to see in a span of perhaps a month of two.  The first couple of times the trailer played, I thought to myself that it didn't really look all that appealing.  In the next few weeks, I saw the same commercial and for some reason this time it was intriguing.  How that was possible, I wasn't quite sure.  But when I further examined the two trailers, I finally realized what was different.  It's amazing how music can affect you.  One trailer was filled with soft playing, gospel like music.  The next trailer assaulted our senses with hyped-up, outlandish hip-hop music.  You can guess which trailer had what music.  I mention this because it just goes to show you that when something is bad, it needs the marketing genius' that sell these products to us to discover a remedy instantly, hence the second trailer.  I am a firm believer that every movie should be given a chance, which is why I see films like Gosford Park, Tea With Musollini and Ali.  Every once in a while you discover diamonds in the ruff like Chocolat, more times than can be counted in one sitting, you get a film like Ali.  Sometimes a first impression is the correct one.The tag line for Ali advises us to forget everything we know about the man. Okay, I did that.  Now maybe it is just me, but if a tag line tells me to do that then there must be a reason for it.  Perhaps they are going to shock me with facts that have been uncovered that have never been made public. Oliver Stone is the master of that, Steven Spielberg can also lay claim to this theory.  But Michael Mann?  He has some work to do. 
I am still waiting for the big eye opener.  I have forgotten all that I know, now shock me.....Ali is almost lugubrious in it's presentation of Muhammed Ali, the man.  It takes a subject and a man that we all greatly admired and almost comically turns him into a caricature of his legend.  I can honestly tell you that I walked out of Ali A) not knowing anything more about the man than I originally thought I did and B) disliking him more for who he seemed to be. Ali always came across as a man who marched to the beat of his own drum.  A stoic, proud and principled man that made decisions based on what he thought was right.  After seeing this film, that couldn't seem further from the truth.  Will Smith's Ali appears to be puppet like as he gets swayed by Muslim beliefs and then betrayed by them only to be swayed once again.  And this is the legend that we all lionized?  What a sham!Besides the story of Ali, the man, the story of Ali, the film, is really quite hollow.  The script is practically infinitesimal and the more you watch and wait patiently to become enlightened with something, the more disappointed you are.  Like a previous reviewer stated, I also came to this film to see Ali run his mouth and to get in the ring.  Smith, while turning in a good performance, is denied greatness simply because the script doesn't give enough to work with.  I read somewhere that the film is supposed to be defined by Ali's ethereal, almost dream-like run through Africa.  Yet this run lasts for what seems like an eternity and when he is finished, I couldn't tell you what it is that he discovered about Africa or himself that he or we didn't already know.  Sly's run through Philadelphia just before his big fight with Apollo was probably what this film was trying to emulate. And it did a very poor job of that. This is a microcosm of what is wrong with the picture.  Too many intangible and uneven scenes and not enough insight and examination into one of the most famous men in the world.  Hey, if you want to see how many women Ali bedded in his lifetime, then by all means, go see Ali.  If you want to know why he became a Muslim or why his best friend, Drew Brown, turned to alcohol and drugs or how he spent all of his money or the amusing relationship Ali had with Howard Cosell or even more about the fight with George Foreman, then this is the wrong film for you.  Michael Mann really has a small resume for such an acclaimed and respected director.  He was lauded for his work on The Insider and he managed to pull off Heat, with Kilmer, DeNiro and Pacino.  I don't know the man personally and I am not saying he is a terrible director, but I just don't think he seems to grasp how to be poignant with his use of such highly regarded situations like Ali and the tobacco industries problem.  The Insider, I believe, was a troubled film mainly because of Mann's direction.  Perhaps his forte is gratuitous action and violence and perhaps he is not well suited to direct something that is supposed to be a great film like the one's he has done recently.  And who knows, maybe it is just me.  But Ali is quite a failure in my eyes.3 out of 10 --  Will Smith is good but beyond his impersonation of the man, there is really not much to like or be inspired with in this film. Most who have seen this have taken umbrage with it.  And calling this a classic film is more than just a little hyperbolic.  It is not even a well made film.",Ali
48,MiketheWhistle,wasn't sure if I'd like it,9,27 August 2019,"I have to say I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this which is probably why it took so long for me to watch it. I grew up watching Ali and rooting for him to win and never paid much attention to the racial issues and his Islam conversion. For me it was admiring his athletic ability as well as his great rhetoric.
I think why I liked this was because it gave me a different facet of his life that I could put with his athletic ability.
Jon Voight as Howard Cosell I have to say was ridiculous. It couldn't be told it was him, so having him didn't really matter. Knowing he was Voight with all that makeup just made me laugh.",Ali

Will Smith plays Ali with great passiond vigor. Micheal Mann direction and cinematography is some the best work he has ever done, but the film drags in its second half and ends on a dry note. I think the film should ahve covered Ali's whole life not just ten years. For that the film gets *** out ****.",Ali
50,mstomaso,Meet the man behind the gloves and the poetry,9,18 July 2005,"Muhammad Ali is a heroic character with legendary wit, humanity, and boxing skill. Always a fighter and always a lover, Ali's life is a subtle and clever story of dignity, strength, and compassion. And Ali himself wrote that story. This film profoundly reminds me of an autobiography Ali wrote several years ago with the help of a friend. Never afraid to do what needed to be done to get where he wanted to go, Ali was never a stranger to controversy, flambuoyance, acid wit, and an outspoken promotion of truth - even when most of his own fans couldn't see it. This film captures the champ's many battles, not the least of which are the internal battles he wages with himself over politics, his ego, money and his own destructive patterns in relationships with women. But thankfully, it does so in a respectful way which does not compromise the man's heroism, nor does it spare the audience of the laughter, mischief and joy Ali became so well known for. Michael Mann's film has relatively little boxing in it, and is in no way a chronicle of Ali's career. A better choice for that subject is ""The Greatest"" - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076111/combined starring Ali himself, or one of the many documentaries on Ali. This film is about how and why Ali is who he is, and how he drove himself and everybody around him to reach phenomenal heights. It features the beginnings of Ali's career and follows him through the most difficult part of his career, when he fought the US government over the Viet Nam war, fought his own religious establishment over his outspokenness, and even fought against hypocritical promoters he relied on who were bent on exploiting the third world. Too intelligent to just be a prize fighter, too passionate to just shut up, and too faithful to give up his religion when it gave up on him, Ali just kept on driving. The film ends after Ali's fight against George Foreman in 1977, so it does not cover his entire career, and does not discuss his more recent activities. His life since retiring from boxing is equally interesting, in my opinion, but since Mann wanted to depict the most dramatic and challenging aspects of the Ali legend, I can't blame him for his choice of time frame.The cast is very strong. Will Smith gives a fine performance wonderfully recasting Ali's wonderful facial expressions, gestures, physical style and speech pattern, Jamie Foxx, Ron Silver and Mario Van Peebles are all excellent in their supporting roles. And the boxers are all very believable. They even look like the people they play. Smith doesn't really look anything like Ali, and you are occasionally aware (mainly through Smith's imitation of the greatest's very unique speech) that you are watching an imitation, but this does not in any way detract from the film.Highly recommended for those interested in real-life drama and heroism, the civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and the intelligent and political side of American sports. NOT recommended for fans of boxing movies and action films. This is a slow moving, intense drama and neither a feel-good film nor a slug-fest.",Ali
51,vithiet,Not a complete dud but could have been better,6,24 September 2020,"I don't think it deserved to bomb the way it did when it came out but it sure is a bit disappointing... I guess I always felt it would be, which is why I postponed watching for what, 19 years? Extremely good performance from Will Smith and basically the entire cast. However the pacing a little all over the place and rather dull script didn't help; how did they manage to make the life of one of the most entertaining athletes of the 20th century feel so boring?",Ali
52,kevin c,HE SHOOK UP THE WORLD,6,2 March 2002,"This is not Mann's best film, but it's still a great film. It shows that Mann is easily the no. 1 auteur in 2002 Hollywood. It is also Smith's best performance since ""Six Degrees Of Seperation"", and I'd be happy to see him take the Best Actor Oscar later this month.I feel the critics wanted more Ali humour. Instead you get to see the darker, pensive Ali. You ge a great insight into 1960s USA. The African scenes are spot on, and the closing stadium scene rivals anything in ""Gladiator"".",Ali
53,brchthethird,"Mostly good, slightly unconventional biopic",7,22 October 2021,"This film has a lot to recommend it: Excellent Will Smith performance, impeccable technical credentials, mostly solid music choices, kinetic boxing scenes, etc. My main issue with it, although I still like it overall, is that the narrative meandered a bit too much, and went on a little too long. The only scenes which really popped for me were the fight scenes, especially Joe Frazier and the climactic Rumble in the Jungle (which was amazing). There were also some solid supporting performances, particularly by Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X. His assassination, for me, was the most dramatically affecting part of the whole film. Also mentioned that the music was generally excellent, although an R. Kelly song took me out of the experience for a bit. Overall, a bit below from what I expect of Michael Mann, but was quite good as a Will Smith vehicle.",Ali
54,aciessi,Stings like a Bee.,7,7 August 2020,"Muhammed Ali's life is big enough for six movies, let alone one. A giant life, that thankfully was brought alive again by Will Smith. He's just perfect here. Everything from the cadence of his voice to his glide across the ring. He was born to play him. Arguably, this is the performance of his career. Throughout, this is a thrill ride. Michael Mann does as good of a job as he was expected to do. The only qualm I have is how reliant his direction is on other existing sources. His interpretation of Ali's relationship with Malcom X leaves a lot to be desired. It copies Spike Lee's Malcom X, right down to the moment of his assassination, and the usage of Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Going to Come"". Mann also has a bit of trouble balancing Ali the activist with Ali the fighter within the narrative. It's not an easy feat, but Mann isn't exactly a novice director either.",Ali
55,Stampsfightclub,Very passionate boxing drama,7,10 August 2006,"I'm not a big fan of boxing but this Oscar nominated drama captivated me into the life of the infamous heavyweight champion Ali to show me the various aspects of the brutal sport and made me appreciate the sport in a way I have never looked at it before and all because of one of my favourite actors, Will Smith. Playing Ali was always going to be difficult for Smith but he quoted he was happy to do whatever it took to make the film convincing, which it was. Smith gained a lot of weight for the role and also spent a year studying Muhammad Ali to make the character a perfect match to the real star. Showing this commitment needed to be recognised which it was as he gained his first Oscar nomination, which was definitely thoroughly deserved. The character of Ali is famous for always speaking his mind and standing up for what he believed in and for Smith to capture these unique qualities was remarkable as the film dives deep into the boxer's life. Smith is always convincing as he uses his comedic expertise but also emotional tactics to capture the spirit of the legendary black icon. For Smith to star as Ali was very important in the actor's career as he took the role of one of his all time heroes. It was a very different role for Smith who had been previously starring in comedies and action movies such as 'Men in Black' and 'Independence Day.' I had never questioned his abilities but there were points, and still are, where I felt he could have done a bit more in his career than similar roles, and watching this dram raised my respect for the star. The story reflects Ali's life in and out of the ring involving all the controversial issues such as when he refused to be sent to war. The film creates passion and emotion at every corner when Ali is always standing up for what he believes in and the audience can always admire these unique characteristics, being humorous with his rhymes but also being very serious with political issues. His relationships are also reflected and these techniques were thoroughly convincing, showing Ali's different sides outside and inside of the ring. The famous fights from Ali's legendary career are all used wisely to valuable effect. Director Michael Mann uses his creative techniques to slow the pace down at the right stages of the fight. Having slow movements combined with passionate music allows audiences to gain the brutality of the sport. It's a very moving technique and very graphic but this was very important to convince the audience of the genre. The camera slows when a brutal punch is in waiting and the music starts off slow and gains tempo to show the speed of the sport, a thoroughly respectable film technique reflecting the brutality of boxing. Having Ali juxtaposed with other infamous black iconic figures such as Malcolm X and Don King was very important to the film's success. Viewers can gain an insight into the lives of different figures. Ali being King of the ring and Malcolm being an important figure in religious society. The religious iconography used also allows viewers to gain insight into what people valued at the time in the 1960's and 70s. The film is able to show how important religion was to everyone which was also highly significant. There are times during the film when the story seems to lack. A coupe of scenes should have been left out where the characters are talking for too long but audiences have to respect that it was Ali's life and it is better to tell the truth of how it happened. Passionate boxing drama worth watching for anyone who has a passion for the sport. As I've previously mentioned I'm not a fan of boxing but watching this I was proved there is more in depth life to the sport. The story reflects the sport in a way which isn't portrayed in real life. Through the use off Ali I, and many others I'm sure, will gain satisfaction from this film and will appreciate the emotional and comical ideologies put brilliantly forward by director Michael Man and Will Smith.",Ali
56,CharltonBoy,The Greatest deserved better.,7,14 July 2002,"Let me start by saying Ali is a good film, not a great film , but a good film , which for me a big let down. I expected a great film and the worlds most famous sportsman deserved a great film. Everything was there , in place , for a fantastic movie. Will Smith , who is brilliant as Ali, the photography is fantastic and the funding was there , so why didnt this film live up to it's billing? In my opinion there are a couple of reasons . 1. Why didnt we see the Life story of Ali ? What we did see was how he was recruted by the Evil nation of Islam and how he refused to go to war and the notorious Rumble in the Jungle , then is finished!! Hang on , what about how he won his title back for a third time or the battle with Parkinson's desease? 2.The Second half of the film was so realistic in it's portrayal of the Rumble in the Jungle it look exactly like the film "" When We Were Kings"" which although real footage in that film , we had seen it not long before. As i said this is still a good film and the fight scenes are the best i have ever seen in a movie but it still wasnt good enough. 7 out of 10.",Ali

I just could not unsee Will Smith cosplaying as Muhammad Ali.I also really did not like the casting of Jon Voight as Howard Cosell. I thought the way he was made up looked ridiculous.The film itself really drags and feels even longer than it is - and it is already too long.",Ali
58,Pedro_H,Light punching bio-pic with a struggling lead,6,22 July 2003,"The life of Mohammed Ali has been told so many times that only the story of Jesus and the Beatles have been told more. Despite this, the workman like TV director Michael Mannn thinks we should have another jog through it with Will Smith playing the world class boxer and braggart.The problem isn't that Smith doesn't look like Ali, he does a bit, only he looks more like a middleweight than a heavy: and besides, he is clearly far too old to be the young Ali (or should I say Clay?) - but I may be getting picky. In truth nobody could play the role and be believable, Ali was too unique.Journalists tend to make excuses for Ali the man because he made their jobs easy, but the problem is that Ali - the man not the myth - wasn't really any angel. His search for religion doesn't bare scrutiny because he never allowed anything to interfere with his life of doing anything he wanted anytime he felt like it. He wanted to enjoy the protection and wealth of his country, but didn't want to join the army - even though he was hardly going to be put on the front line.(Many countries have conscription and although Vietnam was raging what is there is praise about his behaviour? Instead of being in a barracks he was in hotel rooms with room service and floozies. Political or religious stand my foot - he knew the army would be a world where someone told him what to do and that has never been Ali.)Apologist always says that his public persona was a sham, but his mouth was ranker than the average sewer not caring much whether what came out of it was accurate or not. His pillory of Joe Frazier (who he never really overcame despite having three fights with him) was nothing more than racism. No white person could have got away with calling a black man a ""gorilla."" Even his charity could be put down to stupidity, most of the people that got his money could have gone out to do jobs other than bag carrying or towel straightening.Mann has got in to the grove of new film making by pretending to be a documentary. The wobbly camera making the thing ""more real."" It also allows for angles to hide the stars unconvincing frame. Strangely Smith doesn't know what to do with the private man, other than to look a bit shame faced when confronted by his lack of faithfulness or plain stupidity. The world has never been able to differentiate between people that talk a lot and people that talk a lot of sense. Not to say Ali couldn't, occasionally, be funny or insightful.A lot of this movie doesn't gel, it wants to play Ali as the underdog, but he was not the under dog, but the champion. Even when he wasn't he was paid like he was. He wasn't cheated (unlike so many), he was well paid thanks to a ring of good people. For the record most of them were white; but that doesn't fit the story or the film.We learn nothing about Ali from this film and for long stretches we are barely entertained. We have seen the real fights and know the outcome, drama without suspense cannot be real drama. Many American heroes (Brando, Elvis and Lucas, for example) get fat, lazy and lose the plot; but this film at least knows that it is best to quit before this happens. If only the real Ali had...",Ali

60,esteban1747,"Part of the heavyweight boxer's biography, Muhammad Ali",8,4 March 2002,"Excellent film, which deserves an OSCAR, let's hope this will happen. The film is really good because it shows several interesting things of history of USA, politics, Muslims and boxing, including corruption in it. In the film it is seen how Malcolm X was criminally murdered, the problems of Ali with the Muslim's organization, his troubles with his wives, and with USA Government, particularly when he decided not to go to Vietnam. This also includes what he said openly about the war and his feelings about racial discrimination in his country. His second wife said two interesting statements: the first one regarding the former president of Zaire, Mr Mobutu, who took plenty of money from the match between Ali and Foreman, and also about the way Don King was becoming rich. According to her, King was a man talking about the opportunities of black people but behaving as a rich white man. The shortcomings of the film were: 1. It did not show anything about the development of Ali when he was amateur and became Olympic champion in Rome 1960. 2. It failed to indicate or suggest who really prepared the murder of Malcolm X. In any case, I consider the film good in his message and plot, and worth to obtain a good prizes for it.",Ali
61,PersianPlaya408,"Great film, underrated by IMDb",9,20 January 2006,"Michael Manns biopic about the greatest boxer of all time is underrated on IMDb and by critics. I thought Mann focused on the most important events in Ali's life, which was something to be proud of and not easy to fit into a film. The screenplay was well written by Eric Roth and Christopher Wilkinson along with mann. The performances were pretty good although i wished someone better than Mario Van peebles would have played Malcolm X, Peebles was only satisfactory. I liked Will smith in the lead, a good casting decision, Oscar nomination worthy for sure. I also liked Jamie Foxx and Jeffrey Wright a lot in their supporting performances. Jon Voigt was also great as boxing show host Howard Cossell. This is not Michael Manns best film, but definitely a great one, i would place it in the same league as Last of the Mohicans however not as great as Heat, Collateral or The Insider. 9/10",Ali
62,FlickJunkie-2,No biopic can possibly do him justice,6,5 May 2002,"Muhammad Ali was so much bigger than life that any biopic is likely to have come up short.  But to those of us who grew up watching Ali in his prime, this film is a real disappointment.Director Michael Mann is a highly talented director with films like `Heat', `The Insider' and `Last of the Mohicans' to his credit.  Yet, in this film he takes the wrong tack and clutters it with boring details and excessive focus on racial issues that were ancillary to the life of a very exciting boxer and a dynamic showman.To do justice to Ali's entire life, you would have to make three films.  One for the boxing, one to look behind the scenes of a complicated man, and one to chronicle his interaction with the Nation of Islam and the civil rights implications of his refusal to be inducted into the army.  The most interesting of the three are the first two.  Yet, Mann decides to give us the first and third elements with the greatest emphasis on the civil rights angle, which is clearly the least interesting aspect of Ali despite the controversy.  It seems that Mann is on a crusade to impress us with what a central figure Ali was in the civil rights movement and that his boxing was secondary to that role.  Mann wants us to believe that Ali was a civil rights leader who just happened to be a boxer, when in reality he was first and foremost an outstanding boxer with a flamboyant and arrogant attitude and a rapier wit.Mann completely neglects the element that he presents so superbly in `The Insider', the character development of the main character.  In `The Insider', Mann drills deep into Wigand's (Russell Crowe) psyche and turns Bergman (Al Pacino) inside out.  In `Ali', Mann glosses over Ali's motivations and concentrates more on Ali as part of a larger mosaic rather than the fascinating character he really was.  He only gives a hint of the close relationship between Ali and Cosell, which could have been a film by itself.The boxing scenes were well choreographed, but overly long with too much emphasis on too few fights.  Ali was one of the most active heavyweight champion ever, sometimes fighting four or five times per year, but from this film it seems like he had only four fights in his career.  We didn't need to see 15 minutes of George Foreman pounding Ali against the ropes to get the idea.Will Smith does an excellent job of portraying Ali.  Though he sometimes misses on Ali's rapid fire poetic cadence, he hits the mark a high percentage of the time and delivers a very realistic portrayal.  In the ring, he does a passable job of imitating some of Ali's more notable moves like the `Ali Shuffle' and his penchant for dodging punches with his hands dangling by his side.  But no one can come close to imitating that lightning jab.As much acclaim as Smith got for this role, John Voight steals the show as Howard Cosell.  Though the physical resemblance is not that great, Voight's command of Howard's movements and speech patterns is nothing short of phenomenal.One thing that is very disappointing is that the DVD has absolutely no bonus material.  This is a topic that could have provided hours of background material and original footage and there wasn't even a featurette.Overall, this film is entertaining for those who never saw Ali fight, or bad mouth an opponent in a new conference.  But for those of us who were lucky enough to see this brilliant athlete and flamboyant personality in his prime, this film never leaves the ground.  I rated it a 6/10.  For anyone interested in the real Muhammad Ali, see `Muhammad Ali  the Whole Story', a six hour documentary that will show you why no biopic can ever do him justice.",Ali
63,redkiwi,Disappoints ...,7,4 August 2002,"This could have really been a landmark, but unfortunately it falls short. It's reasonably well acted, and Smith has obviously put much work into his portrayal, but it just doesn't quite make it for me.It's hard to put a finger on it -- perhaps its the fact that Smith isn't quite there in physical resemblance to Ali, perhaps its the reminders that you get of the When We Were Kings film, perhaps its the likes of van Peebles not being convincing as Malcolm X.Also, perhaps its the fact that it concentrates too much on the bouts themselves and the boxing action, rather than developing some of the characters who stay on the periphery.This was OK, good even.

Michael Mann(Collateral) makes a realistic portrayal of what it was like for a legend in boxing and outside of it. Ali was so much of a bragger and I guess it was really neatly picked out for Will Smith. Jamie Foxx, well talented and well liked, mainly by me, put up a good performance also as Ali's former friend and helper in the ring. He just did really good and didn't mess up much in his role for his lines. This was a good movie and really realistic in boxing, tied with Raging Bull.

The movie of his life, ""Ali,"" profiles a fraction of this man's illustrious life.  The story looks at the years between 1964 and 1974, between Ali's career-making title bout against Sonny Liston, and the much-hyped ""Rumble In the Jungle"" bout against George Foreman, with many points of interest in between.  Michael Mann did a fine job of showing Muhammad Ali's rise to the forefront of the public eye.  And Will Smith earns his acting chops in the title role.  He plays the role well, showing the swagger of a man who proclaimed himself ""The Greatest,"" then went out to prove it.  John Voight's performance as Howard Cosell is also notable.  The subdued impression avoids becoming a caricature, which is too easy when dealing with Howard Cosell.  No movie may be enough to cover the life of the legendary boxing champion.

All of these where at least worthy of a nomination, if not more.On the contrary, the screenplay was totally lacking (I think the Director knew this, hence the very frequent and prolonged musical interludes...) and the dialogs empty, somehow incomplete. In spite of another great performance by Will Smith, the characterization is also sketchy to say the least, we never really get to understand the main characters, their motivations, the reasons for their actions, and therefore can never really identify. All in all, the movie feels superficial, there is no real 'depth' to it. Younger audiences who are not familiar with the actual occurrences 30 years ago will be totally at a loss watching this film. I must say that even I was lost at times (and I actually lived during the period).",Ali
70,dead47548,Another breathtaking show from Mann.,8,8 January 2008,"Mann put a lot of pressure on his head by attempting to create a film that not only tackled the tumultuous ten year dramatic highpoint of Muhammed Ali's life, but also covered the political conflicts and protests of the times and the vast scope of the civil rights movement including the deaths of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. It's a lot to handle in one film that runs under three hours, and I do feel that he should have spent some more time on the lives of possibly the two greatest revolutionaries in American history, but for the running time I don't think anyone could have handled it better than Mann. His distinctive style, mostly through the camera-work, shines through here as always and it never fails to be a pleasure to watch. He makes everything so sleek and engaging that, even when the scenes are dragging a bit, your eyes remained glued to the screen. Though I do wish he would have used a soundtrack closer to the ones he used in Collateral and Miami Vice, instead of the more jazz-focused one for this but I understand his reasoning.The performances are just sensational all around. Smith delivers one of the best of the year and I commend the Academy for recognizing such brilliance. He completely immerses himself into Ali and does nothing short of absolutely becoming the man. It feels like you're actually watching him. Jon Voight undergoes one of the most amazing transformations I've ever seen. I didn't even know who he was playing until the credits rolled. Jamie Foxx also delivers an exceptional work. His emotional trauma is palpable, and I wish that Mann would have spent a bit more time on him. Most biopics go through so much cheesy sentimentality that it becomes a chore to watch by the end, but Mann goes in a completely opposite direction and presents a hard-hitting, realistic drama that doesn't pull any punches. The boxing scenes are the greatest in film history, from my perspective. Most films use slow motion and fancy camera techniques to make boxing more dramatic, but Mann just puts the camera in the ring and presents it all exactly how it is, just like he does with all of his films. The man is a cinematic genius, easily one of the greatest directors of all time, and this is just another example.",Ali

This film is not bad but not good either. First when I heard that Will Smith should be in it I was a bit suprised, a comedian that stars in films like Bad Boys and Men in Black. Actually he was the main problem with this film. He was not powerful at all. I did not get touched of his acting and he made the film lost the feeling to watch it. It is very hard to make films like this and I think that if you don't know anything about this story you would like it.

I'm not sure how and why they picked the stages they did, but for me it was just way too disjointed. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but I feel it would have been a lot better with a stronger structure. The movie basically features his first title fight win, a couple of other fights and the infamous ""Rumble in the Jungle"". It focuses heavily on his relationships, his religion and his fight against the draft. He's no doubt a fascinating character study, but the movie just seemed to miss the boat a bit.The cast is solid with Will Smith as Ali, putting in a decent performance, Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight.

Heat is up there in the pantheon of cops vs robbers epics, Last of the Mohicans is THE romantic period adventure film, and nobody can argue that the Miami Vice show is the most 80s thing ever created. A visual stylist then, and one who has been good at surrounding himself with the finest talent in the industry on both sides of the camera. What would happen, then, if the Michael Mann train, that well-oiled, slick juggernaught, were to run off the rains into the wilderness? Ali provides an interesting glimpse. It is a biographical film in that it builds on real people and events, but its structure is far removed from the standard formula. it is a character study, sometimes breaking the surface, but more often than not, staring in fascination, which is bound to delight as well as frustrate. Refreshingly though, it is a choice the film commits to 100 percent.Like all Michael Mann films, it is a present-tense film, existing in the here and now, devoid of expository flashbacks: when we meet Will Smith's Cassius Clay, he is already Mohammed Ali, though he may not fully realize it yet. It is the political significance of Clay becoming Ali that the film is more concerned with, much more-so than the actual boxing, which, expertly as it is shown, takes up relatively little of the film's running time.We follow the ""Greatest"" from his discovery of Islam to his final great political stand in Zaire, all the while focusing on the little details and impressions rather than narrative beats. Throughout, well-surrounded though he is, Smith carries the full weight of the film on his shoulders, and he never lets us down once, giving his character an unparalleled aura of power and peace unparalleled. It is bewildering to thing that the Academy instead chose to crown Denzel Washington for his cartoon villain in Training Day. The care and love poured into this oozes out of every immaculate frame, and, not for the first time, Michael Mann shows us the difference between a ""movie"" and a ""film"". Worth your time and consideration? You bet!",Ali
74,SonicStuart,It was good but long,6,9 April 2004,"AliStarring: Will Smith, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jon Voight, Mario Van Peebles and Jeffrey WrightGenre: DramaRated RWill Smith stars in this story about a true legendary boxer name Muhammad Ali! Muhammad Ali got his bike stolen when he was a kid and so then he started taking some boxing lessons and started getting into boxing and decided to do that as a career. Muhammad Ali is pretty much like Michael Jordan but different. Muhammad Ali was became the world's greatest boxer ever! Especially with all those champions he win and didn't give up to get to them either and also famous for one of his sayings, ""I move like a butterfly but I sting like a bee!"". The movie was good, Will Smith did a good job but the movie was too long, I wish they would of cut some parts that they didn't really need. Good but long.",Ali
75,Quicksand,Skipped Parts,6,1 May 2002,"Will Smith has charm and grace, but little else as far as acting chops, so it surprised me when he nailed this role so beautifully.  It's a damn shame they didn't put that performance in a better film.I'm in a train car riding by Ali's life.  The same detached storytelling technique was used in Oliver Stone's ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" and while Tom Cruise was nominated for an Oscar for that film as well, both films left me feeling worn out and bewildered.  Huge chunks of the stories were left out, and while some may deem that as acceptable because the subjects were so larger-than-life, I demand more from a film.  Others have tried and succeeded before.I didn't live through this historical era, but in addition to the above criticisms, from an aesthetic standpoint, I can say that Mario Van Peebles has the charisma of a wet noodle, and the ending left a lot to be desired.There's a little Epilogue before the closing credits roll, and I want to know more about THAT.  So Ali lost and regained his title in the late 1970's; does the movie make an effort to show why they're showing the Foreman fight and not the one ten years later?  These are events I want to know about, even if the significance of them is something less than One Man standing against the Vietnam War.Ali the man is significant enough.  6/10.",Ali
76,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"Smith is superb, but this is now all-but forgotten and that should not have been the case for a film about Ali...",7,4 May 2020,"A biopic about Muhammad Ali, possibly the greatest boxer of all-time, should not be as understated or practically forgotten as Michael Mann's 2001 picture is. It isn't as if ""Ali"" was some low-budget effort with an unsung team behind it. Directed by Michael Mann, who was a big name at the time following 1995's ""Heat"", and starring Will Smith as Ali. It took a lot of courage to take on this role, and Smith, in my opinion, is perfect. He's seen as a comedy and summer-blocker-buster star, with his career-defining roles in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"", ""Independence Day"" and the ""MIB"" films. Here, Smith took on the most challenging role any actor could hope for, and he is triumphant. It is hard to picture a better performance, and any nay-sayers about him before this film was released were undoubtedly silenced.The weakness of ""Ali"" and the reason why it is now so understated lies within a highly convoluted script and the fact that director Michael Mann appears to have become overwhelmed by the material. The directing is rather weak as in Mann appears to lose all focus in generating the excitement and drama and instead he shoots the film like it were a documentary. The boxing scenes are very well-done and the script is good in that it does well to grapple with so many events which took place between 1964 and 1974. We have everything from Ali's refusal to join the US Army when he was drafted, to his famous bout with George Forearm in Africa. But herein lies another problem; the film is obviously geared towards a viewer that has some grounding in the life of Ali, because otherwise you would be completely lost, especially when it comes to the political side of things. While this is a good film and well-rounded, it is far from the ""Raging Bull"" quality that it should have been, and is ultimately forgettable and probably not something you'd watch a second time.",Ali
77,ragingbull_2005,A masterpiece,7,19 June 2020,"The movie has its task cut out.Muhammad Ali was a sportsperson unlike any other. He was present at the cross roads of historic events such as civil rights movement, Vietnam war juxtaposed with his boxing successes. He was brash and supremely confident. He was a fanatic in certain religious aspects , but was very liberal while philandering. And Will Smith nails all these parts with stunning brilliance.The boxing matches bring out the ferocity of the fist fights. The drama, centred around Ali's marriages, his membership in the League Of Islam and friendship with the radical Malcolm X, his legal troubles with the US government, everything gets screentime.The screenplay doesn't let the narrative lag. For a film made 20 years ago, it feels like a freshly released master piece.Really enjoyed it. Highly recommended. Streaming on Netflix.",Ali
78,barberoux,Wonderful,9,15 January 2002,"I really enjoyed Ali.  I thought it was well paced and it seemed to capture the essence of Ali and his times.  Will Smith was perfect as Ali and the supporting cast was excellent.  Jon Voight as Cosell was fantastic and Jamie Brown was wonderful as Bundini Brown.  I really didn't think he had it in him.  Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee, this movie was filled with convincing, touching performances.  Others have complained about the Zaire running sequence, I found it evocative and meaningful.  It wasn't blatantly presented.  You weren't told what to feel but were presented with a situation and were allowed to extract what you wanted.  (Spoiler possibly looming ahead).  For me it showed Ali realizing that he was more than a popular boxer but was an icon of power over oppression for these people.  His victory was not just for personal glory but would be a positive message to downtrodden people. He had to win for them.  (Spoiler warning defunct.)  This was not a boxing movie but was a movie of a man and a slice of his history.  That said, the boxing sequences were very well staged.  Ali's opponents were well portrayed and the punches looked like they hurt.  Ali was more than a boxer and the movie investigates all of him.  If you expect some kind of Rocky movie you'll be disappointed.  This movie was so much more.",Ali
79,Brogan,Ali Boma Ye!,10,20 December 2001,"The comment is the chant that boxing legend Muhammed Ali was receiving when he Ziare in 1974 for his boxing match against George Foreman (traslation: Ali, kill him!).  This is the latest film from excellent director Michael Mann, who is one of the few directors working today who has a unique trademark, and the talent to go with it.   ALI is is a film that will have viewers understand why Ali was such a extradonary boxer and a famous figure. Cassius Clay who later changed his name to fit his Muslim belief to the now famous Muhammed Ali (Will Smith) was the most popular and best boxing contender in the 1960's and 70's.  He is nicknamed ""the champ"" because he would win every boxing match that he competed in.  He is famous for his political beliefs as well as his boxing fights.  Ali was good friends with Muslim activist Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles), Malcolm would be by Ali's side whenever he was in trouble or in financial trouble.  This would lead to the government seeing Ali as a negative figure.  Such a loud mouth man in the 1960's who was African-American (sadly surrogation was still around at the time) and bad mouth the U.S. troops in Vietnam was the target of the U.S. government.   Ali refused to go fight in Vietnam because he has ""nothing against them Veitcong"" was what Ali would say.  This would lead to his arrest and his scandal just because he didn't want to fight in a war that he didn't believe in.  Sadly, people today still spite Ali for his belief in the Vietnam War, yet we see political activist like Abby Hoffman as a hero when Hoffman only protested the war and didn't do anything else. The movie spans from the peak of Ali's career, from 1964 to 1974 (which is a wise move, since I don't want to see the tragic Ali-Hollyfield fight when Ali starting suffering from Parkinson's disease). I watched the excellent documentary WHEN WE WERE KINGS about five years ago and was hooked on the life of Muhammed Ali.  I was curious and entranced by how Ali would say cut downs in rhyme and be so hilarious at the same time.  I was also amazed to see on how such a fantastic fighter Ali was. Ali would go up against the biggest and scariest looking fighters (Sonny Linston, ""Smokin Joe"" Fraizer, etc.) and no be afraid to fight at all.  Ali was the first athlete to be a athlete and entertainer.  Ali would entertain his audience when he was outside the ring with what he would say, and inside the ring by his punches. I thought ALI was a outstanding film, it does a great job on showing what makes Muhammed Ali one of the most important figures of the 20th century.  Will Smith does a brilliant job playing ""the champ"" as he has the attitude and talk just like Ali does.  It shows that when an actor does a lot of homework for the real life person that they are going to be playing, they do such a amazing job that you think it's the real person when you're watching the film (i.e. Jim Carrey in MAN ON THE MOON, Woody Harrelson in PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT).  I am hoping that Smith gets at least a nomination for his role in this film (I would like to see him win, but since Ali is still a controversal figure, it wouldn't surprise me that if Smith gets overlooked).      The other acting in this film, especially by Jon Voight as legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell is top rate.  Mann does his usual skill and casts a wide range of stars to play in his films (like he did in HEAT and THE INSIDER), and with ALI, Mann casts another large cast of talented actors and actresses.  I not only enjoyed Voight, but I also enjoyed Jamie Foxx who played Drew ""Bundini"" Brown, who is Ali's friend and co-trainer.  Other acting performances by Ron Sliver, Mario Van Peebles, Jeffrey Wright, Mykelti Williamson, and Will Smith's wife Jand Pinkett Smith all give a great support in the film. As for Mann's directing, he does a great job as he has done before.  He still can tell a epic story and making it exciting from start to finish. But unlike telling about a heist, or a whistle blower, this is about the career peak of person, and Mann uses his usual talent again.  The slow-motion movement, the close up shots of the actors, the lighting, and music are the trademarks that Mann has used in his career and shows it again in this film.  I didn't think ALI was as complex and intelligent as THE INSIDER or as brilliant as HEAT, but giving some time like fine wine, ALI will age gracefully to stand on it's own.  And when it does, it will be for one man's viewpoint of the world, instead of several people's view like in INSIDER or HEAT. I would find ALI to be the most powerful and entertaining film of this year.  Since there are excellent movies being released week after week this month, ALI has stood out above the rest with it's quality of storytelling and style.  I would just hope that ALI would be remembered in Febuary for the Oscars, and maybe Mann might get the Oscar he should have gotten two years ago for INSIDER (yea, I still think Mann did a better job than Sam Mendes!)     ALI is a film that similar to other films in the past tell about a person's life, and their view of the world.  And like the other films, you get a better understanding on why the character acted the way they did (like Larry Flynt and Andy Kaufman).  But that this is a story being told by Mann, the style with storytelling is what makes it unique and amazing.  This is the best film of 2001 (until maybe next week), but still, don't miss it! ***** (out of five)",Ali
80,smellthecult-com-1,"Muslim radicalism, boxing, black equality: it's all here",10,23 September 2009,"Fascinating biopic of one of the most interesting and controversial sportsmen to ever grace the world, this is unflinching in its portrayal of all facets of Ali's personality. From his early conversion to the fundamentalist Black Muslim cause - which caused ripples of disquiet throughout America - to his sense of injustice over his treatment after refusing to be drafted for the Vietnam war. This is passionate, artistic movie making, beautifully shot by Michael Mann, just as we have come to expect. Will Smith is stunning in the title role - something I never thought I would write. Ali's wit, arrogance and conviction are captured beautifully. Highly recommended.",Ali
81,Tiger_Mark,"Does not do justice to ""The Greatest""",4,25 August 2003,"I am a huge fan of Michael Mann and a boxing historian. As a result, I was rather thrilled to see that Mann was chosen to do this film, he is very gifted. I was less than thrilled to see Will Smith get this role, however, I was willing to give it a fair shot. Well, I was let down in a big way. I really think this film got lost in the edit. They took the most fascinating boxer in the history of the sport, who fought in more big fights than any other, and made a rather dull movie. In fact, this movie has the looks of a made for TV mini-series. However, the most upsetting thing about it, is Mann's insistence on focussing on such trivial matters. Most of the main events of Ali's life are skimmed and long extended scenes are given to nothing, like Ali dancing. I did not buy Smith, he looked like the Fresh Prince trying to pretend he was Ali. Never did I once buy him as Ali. Voight was pathetic as Cossell and the actors that were brought in to play such characters as Sonny Liston were poor. Overall, this movie, although made by a legend, failed to capture the essence of the the ""Greatest.""",Ali

But actually WS did a pretty good job. He didn't look like ali but he looked muscular and almost handsome in this slowmoving but decent show.Best parts were the supporting characters. Jon Voight was wonderful as the sympathetic jew howard cosell supporting the Muslim ali. The don king character was another memorable part and was aptly described by ali's second wife as ""he talks black, lives white, and thinks green."" And there were a host of unknown actors playing great boxers like liston, and quarry and frazier and esp foreman. The fight scenes were OK but of course, nothing can ever match the great fight of Rocky I.This is not a bio as it covers just 64-74 but it does a good job of that.",Ali
84,LuboLarsson,Disappointing,5,12 May 2002,"It must have been really hard to make an average film out of the life story of the great man, but Michael Mann pulled it off. I learnt nothing new about Ali from this movie, I recommend you read a book on the man instead. His life story is incredible, but this film only concentrates on about a ten year period of his life, and its the usual flashy direction from Mann, and most of the time is filled by music videos it seemed to me. I will say this though Will Smith was as good as any actor could be playing Muhammed Ali, he is excellent, unfortunately he's in the wrong film. Very, very disappointing.

86,RIK-22,Yet another awful true story' picture that fails.,1,2 July 2003,"Where to start.  Lights, cameras, action and slow motions and that's about it, unfortunately.  There's something that Hollywood must learn about biographical film making is that you must show something that the public hasn't seen before.  The reason for the appeal of films like this is to get under the skin of the person in question, see what goes on behind closed doors.What was Ali really like in reality, was he more than the public, rude, arrogant, cocky, but great fighter or was he really that sad and one dimensional.  Unfortunately after watching this bore-a-thon, I can only assume he was that dull.They clearly should have shown his childhood and his decent into his later years, this would have been much more interesting, and they could have cut out the rather boring and over long fight scenes.  I'm sure everyone already knew the results of the fights anyway.For some strange reason the film also drifted into a mini bio of Malcolm X and general re-cap of the civil rights struggles of black Americans.  This is all very interesting, but already done to death and please keep it out of a film about Ali.I can't say Will Smiths performance was anything other than just adequate, he never had me believing he wasn't Will Smith.3/10.",Ali

I am truly stunned by how amazingly well the movie captures that era and it pulls no punches with its portrayal of those characters in the background of the champ. As well, the mechanization's of the US gov in coordination of the media, sports and the nation of Islam and their social engineering...This movie is more than about Ali, It's filled with many layers. I am lucky to have been a teen when the Rumble in the Jungle happened. Of course, our media did what they do...Carried the water, besmirched an ""enemy of the state""... There are so many instances of the collusions between these powerful self interest...But...If you haven't seen this movie yet, Like I hadn't...You will be as surprised as I as to how great it is! Special mention to Jon Voight...I saw Cosell his whole career...His portrayal of him was so spot on...He did him perfectly!

This film is a complete mess from top to bottom, start to finish. I recognize Smith had a daunting task to portray one of the 20th century's most outspoken and beloved characters, along with mimicking Ali's boxing style. This role must have taken much studying and preparation both physically and mentally. But this is where my appreciation begins and ends. I ask how is it possible to take one of modern history's most flamboyant athlete and morph him into a boring, unfocused, character? Unfortunately, Will Smith found a way.I'm not sure if I was supposed to be viewing a docudrama or flat out drama as the story telling and directing were never focused. The story and pace endlessly meander in different directions without resolve. I never got any sense of who Ali was or what he really felt as the character development and script were vague at best. As a mater of fact, I sort of left the film liking Muhamad less. The film has no climax at all with no sense of triumph throughout. The script was boring, and the boxing scenes were poorly shot and edited. The music didn't help either as it was a total snooze-fest with poor song choices and uninspired underscore which added no ""punch"" or dramatic support to propel the plodding visual pace. The other characters were paper thin cartoon types- especially those of Don KIng and Drew Brown. Even the closing comments at the films' end was vague citing his marriage failures. Who cares? Not me and certainly not about this waste of a film that does not due any type of justice to Ali. If you want to see a good boxing movie- see Cinderella Man, Raging Bull or Killer's Kiss. If you want to see a good character portrayal based on an actual person, see Patton, My Left Foot, or Queen Elizabeth. This film missed on both affronts.",Ali

Other than that this a beautifully filmed, incredibly acted, and superbly directed film. Will Smith captured Muhammad Ali's passion and fury to a fault. He even imitated some of Ali's moves excellently. Jamie Foxx played Drew ""Bundini"" Brown, Ali's troubled cornerman. Although a comedic character, he has some scenes which are quite serious and moving. Also, the heart of the comedic part of the movie was Jon Voight's portrayal of Howard Cossel which he did great in.

The issue here was the screenplay. Its not a complete or satisfying telling of the man's life. There is nothing about his early life, his Olympic Gold Medal days. It all begins with the first Liston fight and ends with the Foreman fight, and at the same time, this film runs almost 3 hours.Ali's most famous fight, the 3rd Frazier fight, is completely omitted. Ali almost died after this fight. Ali becoming a mental vegetable in his 50s was considered to his taking way too much punishment during his fighting days. Surely this is an important part of the story?Another thing missing, his horrific treatment of Joe Frazier. He called the man an ape, a monkey and an Uncle Tom.This was a huge waste of resources.

Good job.But even with that, this film flounders. No real direction, no real insight. Too bad. I would have loved to have actually learned something about the man. Instead we get a rundown of his career up to Foreman. And that's barely half the amazing things he accomplished! I wanted more. Ali deserves more.Make no mistake, Ali is THE champ. Too bad this movie is not.",Ali
95,mwendel,"So Long, Yet So Wanting (Possible Spoilers)",5,16 January 2004,"Wil Smith did an admirable job of portraying Ali, as Jon Voight did as Cosell, but the story was too unfocused, trying to touch on too many aspects of Ali's life.  It touches on his life as a boxer, a husband, a Muslim, and an African-American.  While each one of these topics, in regards to Ali's life, could qualify for a movie by itself the movie does paint a decent picture of the chaos surrounding Ali's life during the ten-year period of his life featured in the film.  The movie only covers his life from his defeat of Liston to his defeat of Foreman. It briefly touches on his relationship with Malcolm X and to a greater extent with the Nation of Islam, but their isn't a lot of depth and detail. You don't really get an in depth understanding of many of the political issues underlying the motives of the Nation of Islam or how they were really using Ali to their own ends.  I think that Ali being who he was, when he was, had a great impact on the person he became and could have made into good movie material.The movie doesn't cover any of Ali's development as a fighter.  It just provides some of the highlights from some of the biggest fights of his career; none of his first professional fights, nor his Olympic experience, nor anything about how he became involved with boxing in the first place. It leaves a lot to be desired if you want to know a lot about how Ali became such an amazing boxer and the true range of opponents he faced and vanquished.Next, it seems like in every other section of the movie Ali is finding a new flame, divorcing the old one, and marrying the new one shortly thereafter. There is no real study to his weakness for women and how it really affected him and his life.  Its just kind of put out there without any real examination of the women involved or the impact this had on any of the children he had.Lastly, it really doesn't go in depth to explain his relationships with his father, Cassius Clay, Sr., or Drew Brown or Angelo Dundee.  We know how he met his father, but not how he met the rest of these people and what his relationships were really like with them.  There was just so much that was glossed over.This movie was just one big gloss over of what probably were the ten most turbulent years of Ali's life.  All the potential to be a great film, but the delivery just didn't add up.  The characters and life events were there, but all were just under utilized.  The film isn't bad to watch, but it can make you want to change the channel or take a break at some points.",Ali

Jon Voight really shined as Howard Cousell, he gave a flawless performance no wonder he was nominated. Now this movie does have some flaws. The Script is a bit uneven in parts. What i mean is that in the parts with Malcolm X and Ali there was a little bit too much of Malcolm X. I mean was it really necessary for him to be in the picture for that long. The other flaw is the movie runs a bit on the long side at 2 1/2 hours but it doesnt really get boring. The fight scenes were impressive and so were the locations.

97,AmyJenson1995,"Float like a butterfly, Sting like a Bee",7,5 June 2016,"As we celebrate one of the finest sportsmen in history who died two days ago at age 74, I decided to see this movie dedicated to him, Cassius Clay famously known as Muhammad Ali starring Will Smith as the main role.I never watched one of his fights as his career was over even before I was born. I'm not a real fan of boxing either which I find violent and ruthless. But I still know about Muhammad Ali and his legendary stance, his endless will to fight both on the ring and outside. A man who stood for his beliefs and opinions, never flinching once.My very big, personal memory of him was when I watched him in Atlanta, brandishing the Olympic Torch to light the Cauldron. Despite shaking from all his body, he was standing there with so much pride. I was amazed and truly impressed, almost having a tear and getting chills. That was Muhammad Ali, a man of valor, honor and pride.Another proof of his character was when he refused to be drafted for the Vietnam War because he thought this war wasn't right and the complete opposite to his religious beliefs. Despite he knew what he was about to face, he never flinched and assumed his decision until he was finally cleared.Now that I saw that movie, I think it's making a nice tribute to Mr Ali even if I wished that it wouldn't stop at the Rumble in the Jungle, the historic bout between Ali and George Foreman. I would have wished to see him fighting his illness as he was as brave against it and it had a deep impact in his life until his death. Maybe they should have made it in two parts as there is so much to tell about the man.Anyway, I applaud Will Smith performance in this movie. It's one of his finest. He has the same cheekiness, the same way of saying the things straight in an humorous manner. Will was the perfect choice for the role. I also appreciated Jamie Foxx performance as his mentor.

Will did it, and superbly.  He will be nominated.If you love boxing and digging deep into the fabric of a complex character  this is the film for you.  165 minutes flew by for me.  It's not Rocky; it's not a typical sports movie.  It's a glimpse into the kind of man Cassius Clay became, and why.  No matter what `life path' one takes, there are toll booths along the way.  This film puts you there, in those booths, for better and for worse as Ali career unwinds.The relationship with Howard Cossell (Jon Voigt  Nomination!) is dissected with strategic snapshots from their time together.  Angelo Dungee is passively presented until an interview just prior to the Rumble in the Jungle.  Then we discover less is more' as Ali describes the bond he has for the man in a single, well-timed sentence.  Likewise, we see Ali at home  Before During and After fame hits.The best advice to Ali came from John Lennon.  Paraphrasing, `When it gets real, that's when it really gets unreal.'  See the film and that line will drop right into place for you.  7 / 10.",Ali
99,zalfunk,Unrelenting and enjoyable,8,10 January 2021,"I enjoyed this film. It's well made and highlights MAli's 10-year period from 1964 when he faced major change and personal strife. 3 wives at every hurdle is a hefty negative but that's key to the overall picture - it wasn't all good.
The GForeman fight in Zaire appeared very realistic based on my own personal recollection - great acting and camera shots to show the pounding he received and defence turned into offence by the great one. Fights don't usually come out so good when Hollyweird gives it the 'cinematic' treatment.
Unrelenting and enjoyable.",Ali
100,RolloTomasi,Great. Inevitable. Unnecessary(?),8,2 January 2002,"There is no doubt that Michael Mann is one of the foremost directors working today. His task here, though, is impossible. How can anyone, even the best of narrative filmmakers, really capture the life of such a familiar and beloved living legend? The Ali story being translated to film was unavoidable. It's an honorable effort in the hands of Mann and his performers.   Mann succeeds at wrapping the Ali story into a film that's meaningful in itself, rather than simply documenting a life. In the decade spanning 1964 to 1974, we see how Ali's life was such a paradox. With the blessing of Ali and his family, Mann breaks down the legend and studies the man. It shows a person who had too many allegiances, resulting in a lot of pain for many who knew and loved him. The most profound moment is Ali standing before the drawings of him children have made on the walls in Kinshasa. As if he never realized how far reaching his impact has been, the picture depicts him using his boxing gloves to fight off jet fighters and tanks. Under this, the locals' chosen slogan, ""Ali Bumbaya,"" which means, ""Ali kill him."" In that moment, all the sacrifices he'd made, standing up to the draft board, speaking out against the Vietnam War, sticking to his religious beliefs, seems to culminate in something. He can actually see the evidence of it through the eyes of children. This scene does contain a few anachronisms, such as showing a kid on a razor scooter--in 1974, and some of the clothing they wear.The six fights (Liston, Liston, Quarry, Terrell, the first Frazier, and finally Foreman) are recreated with stunning accuracy. The voice-overs of what Ali was thinking I could have done without.  It's in these scenes that Smith is able to inhabit the Ali character the most. These are the scenes you're really able to forget an actor is playing Ali and believe for a moment that you're really watching him fight. The film skips over Ali/Frazier II, barely mentioning it in fact, and goes straight to the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" with Foreman. This move sucks some of the drama away from how Ali wins back his title. It's also not made clear enough that Foreman was the champion at the time of the Zaire fight, having beaten Frazier, who'd beat Ali. Ali then beat Frazier in January of 74 to earn the right to reclaim his belt. That second Frazier bout was critical and shouldn't have been swept aside.    Despite having to condense so many events into a short time, the film is cohesive, a major triumph for Mann. But too much of his life had been lived in public. There was so much TV coverage of him, of his fights, of his press conferences. He was, and still is, a very public person. That leaves a real life of imagery that's almost too powerful to try to tell better in a narrative film.  The Academy undoubtedly won't feel the need to nominate the film or its director for this reason.  The film really doesn't have much that's new to say about the life of Muhammad Ali. To honor the film would do no more than honor the man. This is a position voters won't be comfortable with. They'll be content to leave the job of honoring Ali to the body who's already doing a fine job of it--sports writers, documentary filmmakers, and historians. I do believe that Columbia will promote Smith's performance enough to get him a much-deserved nomination. Some technical awards are possible as well, such as editing, cinematography, and original score.Grade: B",Ali
101,tomb_92,"Heartfelt, brutal, emotional",8,26 August 2009,"This is a good film, i enjoyed it a lot. One of the main problems however is that although Will Smith gives one of his best performances (with the possible exception of Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happiness) it still looks and feels like I'm simply watching Will Smith as Muhammed Ali. This wouldn't be a big problem if it weren't for the fact that this is supposed to be about a real-life character. I think the problem lies in the fact that Will Smith is too famous to be given a role like this, it should have been given to an unknown so that most of the film isn't spent watching Will Smith as Ali but someone who we don't know as Ali because this would have been more convincing already. It is a good film though, set in rough times for ethnic minorities in the US. You can really feel the emotion, especially during Ali's downfall, and comeback. The best scene is Smith running through the streets of Kinshasa, Zaire before Rumble in the Jungle, followed by kids shouting his name. Does go on a bit too long though.",Ali
102,charlessmith702210,"Well, the movie was not as good but still Will Smith delivers",6,9 January 2007,"I can remember that scene when Cassius fought Liston for 6 rounds, and then, stunning both the crowd and boxing experts who believed the Cassius would lose the heavyweight championship fight, by overwhelming Liston in the seventh, causing Liston to drop his mouth-guard and quit fighting. I realized something unusual in Cassius....he used his trash-talking and poetry to reveal himself as the people's boxer. That was some technical knock-out that Liston put on himself, and Liston, later on in the flick, wanted a rematch with Cassius.What was scary was how they set up the assassination of Ali's friend, Malcolm X, after trying to speak at the pulpit. From the first rifle shot that took out half of the lectern to the additional shots that were probably done for good measure, I could see why the 1960s were perhaps the most fearful time for African-Americans in the USA.And I was speculating why did the Selective Service made a classification change in Cassius Clay, from being disqualified after taking the Armed Forces Test to being inducted to the U.S. Armed Forces. Probably the Selective Service wanted him in the U.S. Army because of his hand-to-hand fighting skills as a boxer, but this might be an inside job by both the CIA and the FBI, who wanted Cassius out of the country to keep other Blacks in the USA from being an idol to him because of his involvement in the Nation of Islam. Or, perhaps the U.S. Government may have thought of Ali as an Pan-Africanism activist who wants to go abroad to avoid the turbulent 1960s in the USA.And so, Cassius starts his fight with the Selective Service, refusing to be inducted when required to, gets arrested and goes to trial for refusing to be inducted. He then becomes a full-blown antiwar activist and he realizes that things are going down for being an activist...his boxing license was taken away, he could not fight in Mexico, and eventually, he was found guilty. His lawyers starts the appeal process of his maximum 5-year federal prison sentence, but they themselves are fighting like Ali. The appellate court rejected the sentence appeal and they had to go to the Supreme Court. It is either that, or Cassius gets 5 years in jail. And even worse, one of the lawyers hears the gunshot heard around the USA---that gunshot that killed one of the most important civil rights leaders in the USA--Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Well, it was a twist when Howard Cossell said to Ali that the Supreme Court accepted the appeal, keeping Ali out of jail and overturning his conviction.Now, all of Ali's eyes were on Jo Frazier. He wanted a rematch but Jo got knocked out by George Foreman, dethroning Jo Frazier's heavyweight crown. Now Ali had to think about George Foreman instead of Jo Frazier.The boxing fight in Kinshasa, Zaire was rather boring, even in the scene involving the ""Bumaye Ali!"" chant before the big fight, but it was George Foreman's fearful presence that kept it too boring.",Ali
103,frankiehudson,Pathetic Ali hagiography,2,7 July 2002,"This film is rubbish.Ali was just a boxer from the South, but he's made out to be some folk hero with grave political charisma and beliefs.Ali was a totally rude, impolite and obnoxious loud-mouth thug; that's all there is to it.  All the political rubbish in the film about not wanting to kill Asians is fair enough but then why try and smash up your own race for money back home, eh?  Ali was a moronic stooge who got wrapped up in a load of black activism which he didn't even understand.The film is too long, the plot is non-existent, and the whole film is put together like some sort of episodic mini-narratives all stitched together. However, Will Young is a fine actor.",Ali
104,DorianWynHowells,What a load of rubbish! I hated 95% of this film!!!,3,26 February 2002,"The only good thing about this film is the few boxing matches that are included, the rest is complete crap!I'm sorry, I know I'll upset a LOT of people by voicing my opinion, but hey, it's MY review, I can say what I want.Will Smith, at times great, at other times absolute crap. He can't do drama at all, and neither can Michael Mann direct it. The hand-held camera technique, to lend the film a kind of 'documentary' feel was really making me dizzy and I almost walked out 5 times. I think the only reason I sat through the entire film was so I could see the final fight, the infamous 'Rumble in the Jungle'.I'm sorry, I just didn't like this film. It felt like a very very loooooooong film, and all the pointless music and cabaret scenes were truly irritating. I wasn't even moved emotionally when Malcolm X was murdered, when I felt I SHOULD have been crying my eyes out!! Alas, the director and the cast and the hype amounted to nothing in my eyes.I hope Smith DOESN'T get the Oscar, he doesn't deserve it. Yes he may have trained for months on end, and got Ali's mannerisms, but he didn't do anything for me.But hey, that's MY review, and don't be foolish enough to trust my word, go and make up your own mind. And another thing, I went into this film with almost no expectations, and I have to say, I felt awful coming out of the cinema, I was robbed of my money! Oh well...3/10 - and that's only for the glimmer of potential from Smith, and the opening/final boxing matches.Erm...Enjoy!",Ali
105,brianlion,WILL SMITH SHOWS HE'S A LIGHTWEIGHT PLAYING ALI,3,10 November 2002,"I consider Muhammed Ali to be the greatest fighter of all time, and one of the greatest entertainers also. This movie, and Will Smith, fall short of expanding the legend of Ali. Maybe Ali was just too big to truly capture. First of all, the fight scenes must have been choreographed by the same guy who did the Rocky movies, or maybe the old Batman TV shows. Every punch connected hard, with a audible thud! And was it necessary to show the bedroom scenes? Yes, they wanted to show the complete picture, but somethings are better left to the imagination. Will Smith would have been better playing Ali without a script and reacting. Instead tries to act like Ali, and proves he is a lightweight. John Voight did a better Cosell than Will Smith does Ali. Ali was about struggle and proving things. It was about his relationship with Smokin Joe Frazier, and the media and Cosell. Watch the real Ali on old shows like the Joe Namath show, or Wide World of Sports. He was articulate and at various times, intense, playful and a master of communication. This movie falls short and loses by a TKO.",Ali
106,eckhouse24,Ali Not The Greatest!!!!!!,1,8 January 2002,"Imagine watching a person run through the villiages of Africa for 20 minutes, looking at paintings of himself on the buildings, people chanting his name. Now, imagine watching that same scene in slow motion. That is exactly what we got in the movie Ali, a long, slow motion scene of Ali running through a villiage in Africa while looking at paintings on the wall.(Some Spoilers ahead-It is based on a true story)Ali had such promise, and delivered very little. The opening moments of the movie seem to last forever, probably because that song was 15 minutes long. Finally, after a long 15 minute intro, we get actual dialogue.
Ali does nothing to keep us into this film. What seemed to be an important part of his life, the whole draft dodge, the court cases, the battle, etc....once again, is put on the back burner, almost as it never really happened. One minute he can't fight, the next minute, we are greeted to a 2 minute scene with Joe Frazier. If you want to see the Joe Frazier portion of Ali's life, don't blink, because it is over that fast. What was one of the greatest feuds in all of sports, this movie shows us very, very little of this feud. Instead, we are shown a long drawn out scene of Ali Running, and then a slow motion boxing match with Foreman that ends the match. You want to know more of Ali's life after George Forman, read a book, because this film stops there.In this long three hour movie, we learn next to nothing about the ""greatest"" boxer of all time. We learn about a friendship between Howard Cossel and Ali that was not to be(Entertainment Weekly suggests that they only had a business relaitionship.) We get very little of Joe Fraizer.
In the end, all we got was to pay $8.50 for a three hour nap.",Ali
107,The_Triad,The Greatest... Nearly,8,28 November 2006,"Ali is a very interesting film that succeeds on many levels that is very brave for covering certain areas of Ali's life that some people will not get. This film is not a portrait of Ali's boxing career, but rather his political activism, involvement in the civil rights movement and his relationship with the Nation of Islam.Biopics are tricky things, and surely, the life of Muhammad Ali could have been covered a thousand different ways. What Michael Mann knows, is that the main ""rise and fall"" story would have been covered in numerous documentaries. Ali, as a result is an intriguing look into parts of Ali's life that the populous may not be familiar with.As for the film, if you can get past this factor, (and for me, it wasn't a struggle at all, but a welcome) the film has a great script, (jumping straight in to Ali's first title fight) cinematography and all that a film usually needs to be good. The acting in particular is exceptional. Will Smith used to be the guy from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air remember? Jamie Foxx was hilarious, Jon Voight was perfect and Mario Van Peebles delivered in the role he was born to play. The film is quite stylish at times, especially early on, heavy on music, though I don't really have an opinion on whether it helped the film or not, (it worked most of the time, actually) just thought I'd throw that in.Ali is a great film, more of a civil rights struggle film than a boxing movie. If you're expecting the usual story, of Ali's boxing career you may have to wait for another Ali film to be made. (I suspect that there will be eventually.) For now though, I'm certainly not complaining.",Ali
108,stodruza,"The film needed a broader scope, and a much, much bigger vision.",4,25 November 2005,"Mann's film was respectful to the champion, nothing more. Most all of the mainstream critics got it right, the film was much more like a funeral procession than the encapsulation of the life of the most dynamic sports figure in history.Michael Man's film falls short in many respects. I remember the meeting between Bundini Brown and Ali as it was orchestrated in the film as something primary in Ali's story, since its placement so early on in the film and just the importance that the director chose to give that event...nothing could be further from the truth.Thomas Hauser's biography would not have been a bad template for this film. Where was Ali throwing his Olympic gold medal into a flowing river? Renting a bus and driving to Florida in order to torment Sunny Liston in the middle of the night before he became champion? At one time at the height of his popularity, Ali said of himself, ""More people know me than Jesus Christ."" He may have been right. As a reviewer noted, Mann succeeded in making Ali smaller than life.Spike Lee has stated that When Will Smith came to him and asked, ""Spike, I need you to expand your vision for this film,"" Lee knew he wasn't going to get the job. Interestingly, Man's film does play in a similar tone to Malcolm X. It was said by Lee also that Man's people scouted all of the same locations that he used in X. I'm not sure that Lee would have brought anything earthshaking to the film, but he would have spiced it up.The film needed a broader scope, and a much, much bigger vision. And if the budget for some reason couldn't contain the scope, than the correct vision could have been enough to propel the film into the stratosphere to which it naturally belonged.",Ali
109,moatazmohsen78,The story of the greatest,8,27 April 2006,"I like the story of Mohamed Ali the great boxer in the 20th century which presented for the audience the story of challenge in many sides in his life as: 1-The problem of color. 2-The problem of his poverty childhood. 3-The problem of his touch with authorities about his refuse to enter to the army in the time of Vitnam war. 4-The decision of American authority to decline the call of Ali as a hero of world in the international champion in boxing. 5-His fighting spirit to return to boxing after the decision of court to return the title of Clay to be the world champion in boxing.Will Smith succeeded in this role that he made an analysis for the character of Clay in different situations because of his rich character.Jamie Fox played the role of Jewish friend to clay and his trainer who helped clay to champion ship in the world , he made an increase in this role by joke and funny from his spirit which was the base of nomaited him in the role of the great singer in pop and jazz (Ray Charles).The master scene in this film was the interview for Clay with many journalists after his refusment to enter to the army in Vaitnam war.I see that the default point that the film didn,t appear it in the film the beginning life of clay as the first champion he played it in the Olympic champion in Rome in 1960 as a hobby in the heavy weight and he won the gold medal which was the base of being a champion ship in his life.",Ali
110,Bevan - #4,Let's consider this: movies are STORIES.,3,27 December 2007,"This one wasn't.We nearly turned off the DVD in the first ten minutes, a vastly overlong montage during which the Cooke tunes effectively drown out what dialogue there was, and the perspective keeps changing in a dizzying and incomprehensible melange of unrelated events.Eventually the movie pretended to follow a linear plot, but only in jerky vignettes with damn near zero for exposition. My wife and I are both Smith fans, but while I'm a sports historian and am quite familiar with Ali's history, she wasn't. Even with my knowledge, I was painfully aware that the movie inferred without actually telling; yep, that must be Malcolm X up there ... yep, I know Clay became a Muslim and changed his name ... yep, Bundini Brown was his longtime sideman ... yep, Howard Cosell was an involved commentator ... Over and over again, I had to stop for a moment to think ""Oh, right, this is THAT incident, gotcha,"" and filled in the background from my own memory.My wife wasn't nearly as lucky, and any movie in which I pause ten times in the first forty-five minutes so that I can tell others what in the heck is going on isn't worth spending another hour of our lives on.3/10, and that's pretty much of a gift for this wasted opportunity.",Ali
111,MyDarkStar,A complete miss,7,17 November 2002,"This film just has so many things wrong with it starting from the very opening sequence. In that sequence we see Cassius Clay preparing for his upcoming title fight with Sonny Liston in Miami. While seeing him prepare, we see Liston destroying an opponent in the ring. We also see the hints of racial tension going on in southern USA, 1964. The entire sequence lasts approximately 8-10 minutes. It is long, drawn-out, and boring. It's the perfect opening sequence for this film.That's because that's exactly how this movie feels : long, drawn-out, and boring.How could someone make a film about Muhammad Ali's life & manage to make the film boring ?!?!? Here's some ways : have long (and unnecessarily drawn-out) scenes (ie : the dance scene where he meets his first wife), or simply have recreations of now-famous media scenes (the Cosell scenes ; the pre-fight scenes). I understand the need for these scenes, but I would rather watch the actual scenes than a recreations of them.By concentrating on such aspects of Ali's life, Michael Mann totally bypasses what I feel could have been more interesting aspects of Ali's life. For instance, I would have liked to see more of the conversation between the newly-named Ali & his father, as they argue on the significance of the ""Clay"" name. That scene had the potential to be very revealing. I also would have liked to have seen more of Ali's first visit to Africa, when he went on his Muslim pilgrimage. Instead, the whole event is used as a way to say goodbye to Malcolm X in the film. To me, that whole part of the film could have been very significant. What did Ali see when he went on the pilgrimage ? How did it affect his life ? Did he recall any of Africa when he went back there to fight Foreman ? We'll never know from this film.I would like to have seen more scenes such as him and Joe Frazier in the car together. That was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It gave me a chance to see more of something that is impossible for me to ever see : an actual private conversation between Ali & Frazier.But there are tons of other things that are left out of the film as well. For instance, after Ali loses to Frazier in the first fight, we don't really even get a chance to see how his first loss as a professional affects his life. This is Muhammad Ali ! How did it feel to him to lose for the first time in his life ? Eventhough Ali played it off in the media as if it didn't affect him, did it in reality ? We'll never know from this film.The pacing of the film was just terrible. As I said, the opening sequence was long, drawn-out, and boring - and was the perfect opening sequence for this film. That's because it is a microcosm of the entire film.
You want bad pacing ? Try this : It actually took the entire first 55 minutes of this film for Cassius Clay to actually defeat Sonny Liston ! The opening sequence was all about him prepping for the fight, and it continued on to the weigh in of the fight, and the prefight comments etc. Then the fight itself was actually quite boring.More bad pacing : The film goes into the mid-sixties in a daze. It doesn't really start to show anything until finally Ali has his now-famous interview with Cosell. In this scene Cosell tells him behind the scene how the government is worried of black militant groups. That is when I felt the film MIGHT start to become more interesting. I looked at my watch to see that nearly 2 HOURS had passed in the film !Even MORE bad pacing : Ali gets his fight with Frazier. Ali loses the fight. But we as the audience never really get to see the true level of brutality of that fight. Between that and the ""Thrilla In Manila"" (which was completely dropped from the film) we never really get a chance to see the true damage that those two fighters endured and delivered in their fights against one another. Instead, we see glimpses of the fight, Ali's knockdown, and a few other aspects. But really it just goes straight to the next scene after that, which has Ali & his crew watching Foreman defeat Frazier. (Like I said, no concern is given on how Ali's first loss affected his psyche). After that, it is straight to Ali-Foreman. Full ""Rumble In The Jungle"" : Don King, Africa, Zaire etc etc.This was actually probably the best part of the film. The film takes on a more ""personal"" look at Ali when he is prepping for the fight in Zaire. We get to see him connecting with the people. Again, I would have liked to see if he recalled anything from his previous visit to Africa - but that was not to be.Even worst, the Foreman fight managed to look boring ! Still, while the fight itself looked boring, I will admit that Michael Mann did a brilliant job with showing the now-famous Foreman knockout punches by Ali. The angles he uses are different with each punch, and it is a very good perspective.Other aspects of this film bothered me. For instance, was Ali REALLY on the phone with someone who was with MLK a second before he was assassinated ? That seems far-fetched to me.The only thing keeping this film from being a complete waste of film is Will Smith's performance here. Smith does indeed do everything that one can hope from someone who is portraying Ali. However, when you get right down to it, I think there are simply some people who it is more exciting to watch in a documentary or biography, rather than a Hollywood film production.So with that in mind, watch ""When We Were Kings"" for anything you would want to know about ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" or HBO's documentary on Ali-Frazier I. If you want a more interesting perspective on Ali's life in general, then watch ESPN's documentary on him - they didn't name him the Athlete of the Century for nothing.",Ali
112,Ed-90,Bright spots but drags too much,6,27 December 2001,"Jon Voight is superb as Howard Cosell...absolutely terrific.  The movie, overall, was worth seeing, and entertaining.  It dragged too much; during the middle some scenes were far too drawn out.  Also, it was amusing to see pay phones in the 1960's scenes that were far too modern...they had the 1980/1990 aluminum and electric blue casings...a little goof, I believe.",Ali
113,Ryan_9,It should have been better,4,25 July 2020,"I didn't like ""Ali."" I thought it could've been much better considering how it was a biopic about arguably the greatest boxer of all time, but it wasn't. This film went way too long and dragged out. It's like they were teaching you about Ali's life, which is something you can see in many documentaries about him. It also seemed like a soap opera with the direction they'd go in. I know the political element was an important part of his life, but they focused too much on politics and less on the boxing, which is a reason it dragged out. I felt the same way about the relationship aspect of it. In addition, many of the characters were undeveloped, such as Drew Brown (Jamie Foxx), Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver), Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright), and Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith). We never really understood them or their actions.Another thing I didn't understand was that we saw nothing from Ali's childhood. To those who don't know this, he started boxing at age 12 because somebody stole his bike, and he told the cop that he wanted to beat the person up for it. The cop was a boxing trainer at a gym and encouraged Ali to go there if he wanted to learn how to fight. I feel like this was a big part missing, and it should've been shown in the beginning as a way for us to get an idea of how he started boxing.For the positives, I'll admit that Will Smith did a stellar job as Muhammad Ali. He really got into the role and put great emotion in with his dialogue and actions. I'd say he deserved his Oscar nod. Jon Voight deserved his Oscar nod too, as he was very good and looked like the real Howard Cosell. The two of them had interesting scenes together, especially when Ali would go on Howard's show and talk. I liked how they respected one another and considered themselves friends, despite all the tough questions and remarks they'd give each other during interviews.Overall, I'll give ""Ali"" a 4/10. It makes sense why this is a lesser-known biopic, as it lacks many great qualities.",Ali
114,picturetaker,I now DISLIKE Muhammad Ali because of this movie! Nah I never liked Ali...,1,13 November 2011,"I've had this movie Ali for years but have never watched it before today. It is a movie about Muhammad Ali the boxer played by Will Smith. I figured it must be good if Will Smith was nominated for an award for his role. I don't see WHY!?! As far as I am concerned this is one of his worst roles I have ever seen him play.I'm not really sure what to say about this movie except I really didn't like it. And the only reason I can see anyone actually liking this movie is because for some reason there is such a love affair with Muhammad Ali that it might be clouding their judgement on what makes a good movie.I suppose he was a great boxer but honestly WHO CARES!?! Because simply in this movie he came off as an obnoxious self absorbed racist jerk. And I don't know the man enough to know if he is or if he is not. Yet this is with out a doubt the worst boxing movie I have ever seen and one of the worst movies period. I really do not recommend this movie that basically figured because it's a movie about Ali that we don't have to try. You always have to try! No matter who its about! Boxing movies can be good. Cinderella man was, Rocky was, Million dollar baby was, this WAS NOT.",Ali
115,LDB_Movies,"Not the greatest movie about The Greatest, but pretty damn good.",7,30 December 2001,"Just a few comments to balance out what others have said:Will Smith already proved in ""Six Degrees of Separation"" that he CAN act. He was very good here. Not Oscar-worthy in my opinion, but a very good job nonetheless. More impressive for me were Jamie Foxx (who also impressed me a lot in ""Any Given Sunday"") and Nona Gaye (who I didn't know had any acting talent at all - but I guess she does).This movie, like a lot of Michael Mann films, sets a tone, an atmosphere, and goes with it. That's the reason for overlong scenes like the opening nightclub scene and the jog in Zaire. Tell me that after the opening scene, you didn't get a great feel for the 60's - the period in which most of this movie takes place.I will defend the jog in Zaire scene too - Roger Ebert even complained that it went on too long. But during the scene, I was thinking lots of things - ""I wonder what Ali is thinking?"" ""I guess he's thinking of how different his life is than these poor people. He's thinking how much of a hero he has become to people he doesn't even know. How much responsibility he has to win the fight because these people all support him. How Africa is his peoples' homeland and how he's basically come home."" All those thoughts went through my head and I think that's exactly what Michael Mann intended. The scene NEEDED to run on and on to convey all those different thoughts and ideas.At the end, I admit I was a little disappointed because I had hoped the film would cover more of Ali's recent life including battling Parkinson's disease. But I guess that's for Ali 2.",Ali
116,vincent-27,tries too hard to be serious,3,3 January 2007,"I was not impressed with this movie. It seems that Mann and possibly Smith made a conscious effort to downplay the flamboyant side of Ali and make a serious film about one of the most entertaining athletes possibly of all time. The ironic thing is that move films go the opposite direction and exaggerate real characters. If you watch the real interviews with Ali back in the day, especially before the Sonny Liston fight, he was way over the top and Smith plays him much more subdued. I can understand that they wanted to show the serious side of Ali, but my make the interesting boring? Why take away from Ali, the very real very calculated showman? THis movie reinforced my belief that Smith is highly overrated and overpaid as an actor (and he can't rap either). Men in Black is probably the best he can do. The only thing he had going for him was his height and the extra muscle he put on, but he does not do a very good impression of Ali, and it has been commented how Ali's very pronounced Kentucky accent comes and goes from Smith and hardly seems to be there at all. Hell, I think *I* could even do a better Ali and I'm white! I also agree about the accuracy, the famous ""what's my name"" tirade of Ali was much more interesting if you watch the actual footage, instead they just had him punching Terrell yelling it, not nearly as interesting.Overall, give this movie a pass, watch ""When We were kings"" instead for the real Ali or even search youtube.com.",Ali
117,daved-3,a mess of a movie,4,24 May 2002,"Ali is, alas, a mess of a movie, thanks to Michael Mann's self-indulgence and lack of focus.  I have admired his previous work, which makes his utter incompetence here so surprising.  Mann refuses to impose any narrative structure onto Ali's life story, so we get scenes that go nowhere, characters whose significance in Ali's life appears to be non-existant, and some scenes that don't have anything to do with Ali at all.  Some scenes are extended beyong tedium, such as a sequence of Ali doing roadwork in preparation for the Rumble in the Jungle.The film does feature fine performances from Will Smith (who captures a young Ali's bravado), Mario Van Peebles (who deserved an Oscar nomination as Malcolm X), Jamie Foxx, Mykaleti Williamson and Ron Silver.  Jon Voight did get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Howard Cosell, but he merely does a competent impersonation and besides, Cosell was too small a player in Ali' life and in this film to warrent it.I'm not saying I wanted an old fashioned bio-pic like The Life of Emile Zola or The Babe Ruth Story, where reality is chucked in favor of a cliche riddled plot; but as a writer/director Mann had to make decisions about what to focus on and what to leave out, and he didn't make those decisions.  I give it a 4 out of 10.",Ali
118,nEoFILM,Needed more...,6,25 February 2011,"I used to have this in my collection but passed it on few years ago. It's not a bad film by any means but to put it simply, it is preaching to the converted, the fans of Mohammed Ali, and those who are old enough to remember him at his prime. I am neither.This was a biopic that simply didn't offer enough information for the indoctrinated to take in, instead focusing, and very well, on the atmosphere and nuance of the day. The key events of his career are played out as the political unrest of the 60′s, and the race movement unfold.But in the end, this is an actors film, and for that I might call it flawless. Will Smith as the titular Ali, is pitch perfect, as he proves once and for all that his can be a great actor, and the transformation of Jon Voight into Howard Cosell, is suburb. Mann is a top flight director in my book, able to convey nuanced situations and craft his films in a style unto his own, but sometimes, I feel a little short-changed, as I do here.I wanted to learn about a man and a fighter from an era that I wasn't born into and was only given so much. But on the other hand, for those who were there, who do know him, the response has been very favourable.A good film for those who know and half a film for those who are not so lucky.",Ali
119,pluto-11,Excellent film! But a tad too much Hero Worship,8,17 May 2002,"Let us chalk another one up for Michael Mann! His direction - combining a stunning visual style and pace - deserves high praise. Normally I am not one to sit still looking at fight scenes for too long, but the clever use of Ali's inner dialogs during the fight kept me interested. Also, as usual for Mann's films: I love the sound/music mix. Remember the sound track for `Manhunter' and `The Insider'? This is just as good if not better.Will Smith's and Jon Voight's performances (and the whole cast for that matter) were so shockingly good that one almost forgot that one was looking at actors on a screen. For a moment I thought I was watching `When we Were Kings' instead of `Ali'! I knew ever since ""Runaway Train"" that Jon Voight was a major talent but Will Smith! Amazing. Amazing. I look forward to Will's next challenging script.I do believe that if `Ali' has a fault it is that the script was unbalanced: too far into the hero worship category if the film is trying to be an accurate biography. Ali is/was/always will be a great man, but he isn't quite the sainted figure that the script makes him out to be. I felt that Ali's treatment of Joe Frazier prior to the 1971 bout - painting him out to be a ""Tom"" and pro-establishment - was self serving and unfair, especially since it was Frazier that gave Ali the chance to regain the title when he didn't have to. This wasn't really touched on in the script and I think it would have been to the films' advantage to show Ali's faults as well as his considerable strengths. Still, Ali has unwavering devotion to his faith, loyalty to his friends, willingness to stand up to the moral outrage of the draft during Vietnam... Come to think of it, compared to our leaders today, Ali maybe does deserve some hero worship after all.",Ali
120,thechosen1,Excellent,9,12 July 2002,"I loved it.  I thought it was a brilliant piece of film making and that it deserved every Oscar nomination that it got.  Especially Will Smith for best actor.  Very well deserved.  Not only was it a completely different role from his usual ones, he had to play Mohammed Ali....that's as different as it gets.  His expressions and his dialogue delivery were superb. The rest of the actors were well cast too.  The direction was great and the story never bored for a minute.  A great movie, well worth the time.",Ali
121,claybo76,Moments Of Being The Greatest,6,3 March 2002,"The best thing in Ali is the acting.  Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, Mykelti Williamson; everyone in the cast gives a great performance.  The worst thing is the length of the film.  It goes for nearly three hours and it drags (it felt like Lord Of The Rings went for two hours) due to some long, boring sequences.  We want to see Ali fight, or hear him launch verbal attacks at a press conference or finding out about some major incident in his lifetime.  Instead we get to see Ali running around in Africa for nine minutes (which feels like twenty) and we suffer through pointless montage sequences which make no sense.  This had the makings of being another Raging Bull, but it just isn't as entertaining.  Will Smith does carry some of the film, as you put up with the slow parts to see more of his performance. It also felt like parts of the movie wanted to deal more with Malcolm X or the Black Muslims than Ali himself.  It needed more focus, quicker pacing and more character depth.",Ali
122,LG72387,Less than what I expected,5,14 May 2002,"Ali was one of the worst films of the year last year. I was surprised to see that it was nominated for 2 oscars. Sure, Will Smith's performance was absolutely stunning. I believe he did a tremendous job in playing Ali. However, I believe that the screenplay was awful. It showed me stuff that I already knew about Ali and exaggerated it over and over and over again. The final scene in which Ali fights George Foreman makes you want to fall asleep. It takes so damn long and looks so damn boring. There was no dialogue during that scene. There were many other sequences that seemed very boring. All except the sex scene between Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. That was probably the best part of the movie. Now, don't get me wrong, if you don't know anything about Ali, it is absolutely phenomenal. However, if you know something, don't see it. Michael Mann directs Ali as if it were for dummies. Seriously, do not see this film because you will waist 3 hours out of your life. (which is how long the film is)",Ali
123,DP-4,Good and Bad,7,29 December 2001,"They call Ali the greatest fighter in the history of professional boxing. Even more, he's admired as one of the top 2-3 athletes of the 20th century. When one goes to see a movie entitled ""Ali"", one expects to walk out of the theater with a clearer understanding of why Ali deserves such accolades. Unfortunately, this movie does not come close to providing such an understanding. If I were not an Ali fan, I would have left the theatre saying ""so what?"" Why do people think he was great? What was so special about the Ali that this film portrayed? He was no more than a loud mouth boxer who won a couple of big fights and constantly cheated on his wife. If this film did truly capture the essential Ali, then Ali could not have been the greatest. Of course, Ali was the greatest. That's why this film is a failure.
Yet, Will Smith does a superb job as Ali. He moves like Ali, talks like Ali and gives an excellent overall performance. The supporting cast were also fantastic. The problem is that they were given a somewhat boring rendition of Ali's life to portray, and were hampered by poor directing. It's a real shame because given a more insightful and interesting script Will could have easily made this one of the top 2-3 films of the year.This film would have been better suited for TV than the big screen. It would have made a better mini-series or single season drama than a movie. Michael Mann was out of his league and his element with this one.
Overall, the movie is worth seeing if you are an Ali fan. Otherwise, you may not understand various parts of the film, and are better off renting the ESPN Sports Century classic on Ali. It does a much better job than Mann does.-- DP.",Ali
124,FabioPirovano,"Forget what you read of bad about Ali, here...",10,7 March 2002,"No precooking movie here...no digital domain here...but a clever biography,an official biography and for these reason unquestionable,tell in the same way with an incredible realism and precision,punches included! Emmanuel Lubezki ,take us in the sixties  with his light, and said about Mann'Michael's instincts are pretty amazing.Others might size up the challenge and decide not to do it,but Michael pushes everyone to make it happen'that's phrase is for amazing shot on the cockpit when Ali is going for the first time in africa,no more green screen mr. nice guy,but in this film according me is a general rule! I loved how Will Smith played ALI,he worth a serious consideration from the Academy(but only 2 Nominations are too bad)...but a nice surprise for me is also Angelo Dundee played by Ron Silver. Smith is surrounded of good actors and I think that the match was show us how Ali life was surrounded of friends and enemiesand Mann been able to do it. Also special mention to Greg Cannom...is absolutely the best special make up artist! Anyway,that's a great Film,157 minutes are simply catalyzed  also because I found the subject ,ALI's Life, very intresting,send great messages,he fight against  peoples for the peoples and himself,wifes and now only against himself, and I hope you'll win this important last round.

126,henfish,When We Were Serfs...,4,9 July 2002,"Cassius Clay [Smith] overcomes many obstacles (including his name) to be the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World.Oh dear!  Surely the basic tenet of a biopic is to tell the viewer something about the title character above and beyond the collection of cliches and soundbites we've already come to know and...Michael Mann must have had the best intentions here, I mean - God knows he's not a bad director; but this (away from the acting and some slick editing) is a cinematic mess!  When a movie exploring the life of one person throws up more questions for the viewer than answers, I think we've got ourselves a problem.  Muhammad Ali was one of the finest boxers of the 20th Century. Does this film tell us why he became a boxer?  NO.  Does it tell us what drove him so much as a boxer?  NO.  Does it even tell us how he really considered each victory and the occasional defeat?  NO.  He was a scandalous womaniser.  Do we find out why?  NO.  We just observe that he seemingly had to act like a slag.  Do we discover how this tallied with his deep Muslim faith?  NO.  We don't even discover WHY he was so desperate to have a deep Muslim faith!  (Despite the consternation of his family and no matter how flawed and selective he was about Islam's role in his life!!).  In short - it's FAQ off! (So to speak).  Anything you wanted to know about the title character of this film will not be on view for the entire, overlong duration of this film.My biggest unanswered bugbear though regards Ali's name change from Cassius Clay.  If it was purely a slave reason then surely all he needed to remove was the name Clay as that was the only association with some distant anaemic 'master'.  The name Cassius was a result of his Romanophile father.  How does that link to slavery?  Are you a slave if your parents dictate your name?  (This debate has a certain infinity about it...!!!)  Whatever.  The upshot is that this film tells us that the slave name - Clay - was removed first making him Cassius X and then the whole name was changed.  And unless you have a fluid understanding of the Islamic faith - this film never explains why!  Indeed, because Mann (et al!) decided that clever (and obtuse) cinematic collages were the key elements of this film in deference to any attempt at narrative, we learn precious little about what made Ali take most (if any) of his steps to glory and infamy.  In fact, by half-way into the film, you are left with the (surely unintentional) impression that Ali was an arrogant, bigoted, misogynist arse-hole who deserved any misfortune that came his way.  Brave film-making indeed!!??!!The vast majority of this confused picture is both morally and emotionally muddy.  Ali's romances suffer from a painful mixture of bad underwriting and way OTT pithy (and sadly, dirgy) soundtracks.  {Fans of black music may feel somewhat cheated here as the verging-on-racist soundtrack would seem to suggest that African American's have only ever written maudlin, self-pitying ballads.  Mann (or whoever!) seems to have suffered a blinkered amnesia when it comes to the likes of Chuck Berry; Jackie Wilson the Supremes et al. All contemporaries of Ali and all conspicuously absent in this film's mundane musicality.}  As to the writing.  It puts rubbish in the mouths of minor supporting characters {some spurious trash about Lennon being the only smart Beatle is incredible!} and soundbites in the mouth of it's lead. Virtually the only interesting things poor Muhammad seems to have to say for himself are in press conferences or in the ring; and sadly, these remain the film's only few highpoints.  The bouts are powerfully done and Ali's relationship with Howard Cosell [a knockout(!) Voight] give the film some rare and welcome warmth.  Likewise, a press conference with Don King [a wonderful Mykelti Williamson] and Angelo Dundee [a faultless but woefully underwritten and underused Ron Silver] provides Ali with his most solid show of humanity as he defends his training mentor (Dundee)against a typically robust King. It also sadly reminds us of another missed relationship opportunity. Instead, the film concentrates on an overstretched exposition of Ali's totally naive admiration for the notorious black leader, Malcolm X [a distinguished Mario van Peebles], a relationship which turns sour for the most unconvincing of reasons:  Namely, that Malcolm wanted to take a different direction from his Muslim overlords.  Clearly self determination was only something Ali was allowed.  (Frankly, I reckon the relationship was doomed as long as Malcolm hung on to his Western Christian name!).  As it is, Malcolm is portrayed as by far and away the better human being. Again. This cannot be the intention??  Michael??But what about Smith?  Well.  He's outstanding.  But he's given no help whatsoever by writer or director because - and this is the tragedy of it all - this is a whole lot of nothing movie!  It has no heart.  It attempts to show you it's trying it's hardest when we can all see the naked Emperor it really and truly is!  It's just a collection of soundbites and highlights. Handbags and gladrags.  It's a gross disappointment and not worthy of the name it purports to celebrate.Don't watch this film.",Ali

It doesn't span a very long time, only a few years, but is over 2 and a half hours in length. It gets really slow at times, especially when Smith and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X just sit around talking about their next exploit. The cinematography in the boxing scenes is just nauseauting. It gave me a killer headache :-)But all in all, this isn't a bad movie. Will Smith certainly earned his Oscar nomination. He was marvelous as the bad-ass, do whatever-the-hell-I-wanna-do Cassius Clay. Jon Voight as Howard Cosell also provided for some excellent scenes, though I've heard better Cosell impressions.\Definitely worth renting if you've got $3 burning a hole in your pocket.",Ali
129,experten,"Good, but not The Greatest",6,24 May 2002,"Do not expect to see a boxing movie, expect to see a movie about a boxer. And not only about any boxer but probably the greatest boxer of all times and also a great civil rights fighter, probably one of the most important and influential ones, which at least surprised me when I saw Ali.There is not a lot of boxing in Ali, but the boxing you will see is ultra realistic (forget the Rocky-style boxing, blocking with the face) and I found the scenes very exciting and well done. There is also a good assassination scene. The combining of sound and pictures is brilliant in Ali and it shows already in the beginning, good enough to give you shivers and the music works as an ignitor of feelings in the same way as in a gospel church.
Even though the movie is more about Ali himself than his achievements in the ring, we will not follow him for more than about ten years and (unfortunately) there is nothing about the beginning of his career or what happened afterwards (maybe just as well). The acting is absolutely first class, Will Smith is phenomenal, which shows that a good director like Mann (remember Heat, the movie that among other things contains the best robbery scene of all movies, except The Long Riders) can bring out hidden talent. Of Course Jon Voight is very good, but he is always good even if the movie is not (Anaconda) and when the movie is good (i.e. Runaway Train) he is remarkable.I would have preferred an even longer movie with more boxing and maybe a little shorter scenes from Zaire prior to the Rumble in the Jungle, except the scene where Ali is moved by the support from the common people in the street of Zaire, which I found emotional and important for the movie.I was disappointed that we didn't get too see the whole match against Joe Frazier and nothing of what happened in the rings after Zaire. I also think that it would have been beneficial for the excitement if Mann had chosen to show us how Foreman crushed his opponents prior to the Ali fight.My rating is a weak 8 / 10. Younger people and those who only want action will be disappointed. Otherwise I think Ali can interest the mature viewer even if he/she is not a boxing enthusiast.",Ali
130,andrew_jakobs,Worst movie EVER!!!,1,27 February 2002,"I have seen this movie, but I cannot recommend it to anyone... It's the worst movie I've seen in about 10 years, Poor acting, No story whatsoever, much too long, wrong use of camera for the time it takes place (My god they used Video in an movie that takes place in 1960-70). The movie is just a bunch of scenes which are put together with no real coherent story, You never know how much time has passed, at one time they say something like 'He finally got his title back which was taken from him in 1967' but it's not clear in which year he got his title back (Maybe unless you are a ali/boxing fan), it wasn't even really clear in what year his title got taken.. Some scenes are much too long and have no real relation to the movie (Like Malcom X being shot, you see a whole 5 minute or so on him being shot, but you only see 10 seconds of ali in mourn about his 'friend'.. BS.. a radio message was more than enough to portrait MX being shot) And there are far more examples of MX throughout the movie...If you think 'The Insider' was boring, don't go to ALI...Micheal Mann had some good movies, but his last good one was HEAT....",Ali
131,SilkTork,Editd By The Tea Lady,3,25 September 2005,"Oliver Stone style documentary drama with good (earnest even) intentions but lacking the right touches to make this film really fly. The fight scenes are excellent documents of what happened in the ring; and, even though (or more probably because) they are safe and clean, they hold an emotional charge which makes them compelling to watch, especially the Rumble In The Jungle fight which climaxes the film. The music choices are excellent in capturing the essence of the period covered, the black soul, the political happenings, Ali's friendships, and underscoring the events on screen. The fight scenes and the music production are the best parts of an otherwise dull, confused, boring and weary film which brought this viewer no closer to an understanding of Ali. The editing for the TV version I watched must have been done by the tea lady because there were many confusions and oddities. Either that or the editor assumed the audience would already know so much about Ali's life and the political and cultural events of the time that it would be just too silly to give people basic information, such as Ali losing his come-back fight. There is much interesting material in Ali's life that would a great film - this is not that film.",Ali
132,EJBaggaley,Islam this - Islam that,5,12 December 2004,"The film 'Ali' was one of the worst boxing films of all time. To be honest, I don't even regard this film as an action/drama film at all. All this film is, is an Islam promotion/documentary on what its about to be a Muslim. Will Smith who played the part of Muhammed Ali/ Cassius Clay was an alright choice for the part, however I can't even take him seriously as an actor anymore for I can only remember him as a child actor (ie.In the TV series - The Fresh Prince of Bel air) and not an adult actor. Fine - Being a Muslim is what Muhammed Ali was all about, but whether or not Malcolm X was assassinated and everything else in this film that had to do with Islamic history and lifestyle should be irrelevant to this film, as this film should be about Muhammed Ali becoming the Heavy weight Boxing Champion, and not the Muslim prophet Muhammed and Malcolm X.

They put in several of his wives and with each there was a sudden jump from Ali being in love to apparently losing all respect for them. I love Ali the man and the boxer but it was hard to sit still for this movie. After starting it and turning it off several times I had to force myself to make it through an entire viewing.

136,dbn3,Missed Greatness by Trying to Cover Too Much (8/10),8,21 January 2002,"[I saw this in the theater, YMMV]I am in my early 30's and too young to know anything about Ali.  All I really know is his Parkensen's like syndrome, the lighting of the Olympic torch, and that he was a great boxer.  So I can't compare this movie to his real-life, only judge it as a movie.  In addition, I have never seen Rocky (my Italian wife calls this a travesty), and the only boxing movie I can recall seeing is _Raging Bull_.The opening sequence in this movie is one of the best I have ever seen.  It lasts about 20 minutes and plays between a Sam Cooke concert, Ali's childhood, Ali's training, a pre-fight preparation routine, and Ali defeating an opponent in the ring for the heavyweight championship of the world.  Almost all the themes of his character are represented in that sequence: sensuality and women; anger at oppression of blacks; determination and persistence in training; the pain of boxing; the glory of victory.If Michael Mann could have continued this style through Ali's conversion to Islam, this would be a great movie.  Instead the second quarter of the movie had me thinking ""I've seen this before.""  The second quarter of the movie has already been completely covered by _Malcom X_, Spike Lee's movie, and Lee did it much better.  I kept looking at the character playing Malcom X and wondering where Denzel Washington was.The movie picks up again through the drama of Ali refusing the draft.  The interesting thing is there seemed to be no greater principle at work than Ali wanting to be his own man, not ordered about by anyone else.  Ali's struggle to continue fighting, to stay financially afloat, and to avoid jail give heart to this movie.  One great scene is when, after Ali's title is taken away and Joe Louis wins it from a chump, Louis and Ali are riding in a car trying to figure out how to get a fight between them arainged.The movie ends with ""The Rumble in the Jungle.""  Ali means so much to the real people of Zaire.  They chant his name and run along side him when he trains.  Ali is pictured defeating malaria (punching mosquitoes with death masks on) and the army (punching tanks).  Ali is a demi-god who can defeat all that is bad in their lives, or at least let them ignore it for a while.Finally, I have to say this is some of the most best cinamatography I have seen in quite some time.  The scenes of the boxing matches are not shot from a steady-cam from 20 yards away.  It looks like there were cameras on the actor's bodies.  It was amazing, the speed and disorientation of the punches as they flew on the screen.A side note: I want LeVar Burton's agent.  Burton gets maybe 45 seconds of screen time, and half of that was of a photograph, not live.  And for all that he still got his name in the credits _before_ the film.  Way to go Burton, can I borrow your agent?",Ali
137,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Not the knock-out it could and should have been.,6,21 March 2002,"There was a lot of hype surrounding Ali, which it never really lived up to. It may have got two Oscar noms, but that's not even close to what was expected from The Insider-director Michael Mann. And the very disappointing box-office came as a surprise as well. But it's my belief that awards and ticket sales usually don't provide any measure of quality, so the question rises: Is Ali really a disappointment?Well, the answer very much depends on what you are expecting. If you are expecting a straight biography, where all the facts of Ali's life are summed up en where we get some insight into the person behind the icon, you will not find it here. The film concentrates on the ten years between his beating Sonny Liston until the legendary Rumble In The Jungle-fight with George Foreman. And along the way, yes, multiple events are neatly ticked off the this-is-Ali's-life list. The women he married, the draft-dodging and his connection with Malcolm X are all there, but the way Mann approaches the material is far from the standard biography method. He flies past certain key moments in Ali's life while lingering on seemingly less relevant ones. He does this mainly by inserting long musical montages during which nothing really spectacular happens. This is definitely not as prosaic as most Hollywood biographies. And it also doesn't find much need to insert audience pleasing sappy nonsense like the more Oscarfriendly A Beautiful Mind. In fact, what Mann has created is an almost impressionistic view of Ali, more a tribute to the man than a biography.This shows in one element particularly: although we get to see behind the curtains to catch a glimpse of Ali's home life, Mann never for a second explores his psyche. You won't come walking out of this film with any idea of why Ali did what he did. Mann doesn't seem interested in getting inside Ali's head, he's not concerned with his motivations. What he is concerned with is the actions Ali undertook that made him such an icon. It's rather disappointing that Mann doesn't attempt to show what the effects of these actions on society were. That does give the film a feel of shallowness. The fact that his interpersonal relations are so thinly sketched also makes it a relatively distanced film. Mann does start off brilliantly. The opening montage, accompanied by only one song of the top-notch soundtrack, shows Ali's confrontation with racism during his youth, his preparation for the Sonny Liston fight and a musical performance intercut together. It's a great way to start the movie, and it highlights the way an impressionist viewing of one's life can work, but subsequently it flies off track a little bit more by the minute, because you realise more and more this isn't going to be anywhere near as coherent or emotionally gripping as The Insider was.Movie biographies are a tough genre I think (pretty much everything that attempts to be largely realistic is), A completely realistic biograhpy cannot exist, not just but also because of the fact a person's life has to be condensed into a less-than-three hour running time. Choosing what to include and thus what to exclude already changes the subject the film describes, so although the historical liberties taken here are slightly less extravagant' than in say A Beautiful Mind, the film still flies past interesting elements like the U.S. government fear of Ali's association with the Nation Of Islam (it is mentioned, but it is never really developed). This happens while the film at the same time does too much recreating of public events from Ali's life. While the way those scenes, the interviews, matches and other public appearances, are handled closely approaches the real-life look, dynamics and charisma of the actual events it does merely display the side we know of Ali, the charismatic athlete. If we wanted to see him, we'd pop the excellent Rumble In The Jungle documentary into the old VCR again. Throughout, however, everything stays very watchable thanks to Mann's stylistically smooth direction. The only problem I have is with the boxing scenes. They may be very well shot (the digital shots really put you into the heat of the fight, yes) but after the third fight, kind of get bored with them. Maybe it's my personal disinterest with the sport, but I found the final fight with Foreman particularly tedious (especially since you know the ending anyway). And what about the acting? Well, Will Smith and Jon Voight may have gotten Oscar nominations but they are no match for the stars of either Heat or The Insider. Much of the problem lies in the script, but essentially Smith's impression of Ali is good (and better than anything he's ever done) and still nothing beyond an impression at the same time (the real Ali has got MUCH more charisma), whilst Jon Voight's performance is more a showcase of great make-up than of great acting. Ali is definitely not trying to be a standard sumtotal-of-the-events biography. And it doesn't go for cheap heartstring plucking either. Whilst the movie does deserve some respect for that and whilst Ali is usually quite watchable it lacks the insight into the man it needs. Maybe Mann was hoping for Smith to provide the insight via his portrayal. Or maybe he simply shied away from making a real biography about the man. Maybe Spike Lee would have made this better (It'd almost certainly be more controversial), because what Mann has left us with is an acceptable but by no means memorable film, deeply inferior to his two previous efforts.Rating: 6/10",Ali
138,Bing5253,Will Smith holds up a very strong role in a good movie,8,26 October 2006,"Ali is a very entertaining and beautiful movie that stars Will Smith as Muhhammud Ali. The plot is simply the life of Muhammad Ali and his amazing boxing career.One thing that I thought was very interesting was the fact that Will Smith has jumped from mildly silly parts in movies such as Men in Black and also in the T.V. show ""The fresh prince of Bel-Air"" to a brilliant performance in a difficult part. His physique is also quite amazing as he is usually not muscular at all but he is very big in this movie. Jami Foxx also co-stars as his sort of coach and also gives a very good performance.Overall, I thought that Ali was a very entertaining and good movie with a strong cast and great acting.8/10",Ali
139,waltcosmos,thank god for free libraries,3,31 December 2006,"Otherwise I would have PAID to rent this. This fell into the category of ""an important"" film. So I felt somehow OBLIGATED to watch it. You know? Cause I'm some white boy liberal (true) who wants to show my solidarity or whatever. But then, after an hour plus into it, I was thinking, man, I am NOT enjoying this crap. WHY am I watching it? I read a lot of the reviews in RottenTomatoes and many of them centered on the role of Jon Voight playing Howard Cosell. They all had nothing but praise to heap upon Jon Voight. So I started watching it for that reason but it was too little and too late. I ejected and watched my second choice movie. (HP and the SS) So sue me.",Ali
140,saugoof,Good but not great,6,3 March 2002,"This movie has been hyped up a fair bit pre-release and while I generally dismiss that, this one had me going to the cinema with fairly high expectations. It didn't really live up to that in the end. Nothing in the movie really grabbed me and the whole thing felt a bit like a tele movie to me. There were a number of problems with it, biggest of all was Will Smith as the lead. That's not saying he can't act, he was great in ""Six degrees of separation"" but the problem was that he's too well known. He had the mannerism and talk of Ali well down but throughout the movie I never had the impression that I was watching Muhammed Ali, it always felt like Will Smith playing Ali. A lesser known actor would have been a wiser choice, even if that would have meant a much smaller box office return. He did bulk up for the role quite a bit but it still didn't look heavy weight size. This is especially telling at the weigh-in for the Ali-Frazier fight at the start. Frazier looks absolutely huge compared to Ali but only weighs in at 8 pounds more. Another problem were the actual fights. Much of the movie had been filmed with handheld cameras to give it a bit of a documentary feel which succeeds reasonably well. But that all gets destroyed when, during the fights, music and slow motion is used to highlight various telling moments or the approaching end of the fight. That, combined with knowing beforehand who was going to win really took the excitement out of it for me.Finally another problem I had with the movie, and I suspect that a lot of people outside the US or under the age of 40 will have the same problem, was that a lot of details about Ali's life are assumed to be public knowledge in the movie. I found the way it skipped over what seemed to be vital information rather confusing.Michael Mann is generally overrated as a director. Although Ali is in style quite different to his previous movies that looked to be stuck in the 80's. Good to see Ali honoured for his social stance as well. Though I couldn't help thinking that if Will Smith today, for example, refused to be drafted to bomb Afghanis he'd be just as hated as Ali was then.6/10",Ali
141,tomligon,Poetry! Rewrites the book on filmic storytelling,10,14 May 2002,"A certain kind of critical response kept me away from this film when it was in theatrical release, and I should have known better!  Michael Mann is one of the most original storytellers working in film today, and his sensibility is absolutely in sync with his subject here.  Muhammad Ali always did it his way, and from the brilliant opening sequence (which breaks all kinds of rules of time and space) to the last scene, that's what Mann does, and with great style, as ever.  Of course if an audience demands a literal drama, they might not catch the poetry Mann and his team create with sound and picture.   Will Smith is outstanding as Ali, vocally and visually, Jon Voight is a unbelievably convincing Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles is subtle and moving as Malcom X.",Ali
142,RockytheBear,Floats like a tank and stings like a banana...,4,26 July 2003,"ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali makes about as much sense as a solar powered flashlight.  There are so many other actors who could portray Ali better than Smith: Ving Rhames, Morris Chestnut, or Kirsten Dunst.  Muhammad Ali's entire career and legacy was over before I was even born, so all my knowledge on one of history's greatest figures came strictly from books, television and word of mouth.  I eagerly anticipated the movie, but wasn't looking forward to Will Smith.What the movie is, specifically, is frozen crap on a stick.  Michael Mann was obviously high off uncut sawdust during production, because this dung fest of a movie doesn't even try.  Just look at the horrific opening sequence, when Ali trains to the credits.  The movie rapidly whizzes through his humble beginnings, which are the most important elements of a biography movie, especially one featuring a larger than life character.  We never even meet Cassius Clay; the movie begins with him already as Ali.  We never learn what life was like for him as a kid growing up, we never learn how he hooked up with The Nation Of Islam, hell-- we never even learn how he got into boxing.  What were his motivations?  Who were his inspirations?  We meet Ali's dad for all of 2 seconds (he's about 8 years older than Ali, by the way.)  And Bundini Brown's character, played by Jamie Foxx, is introduced out of nowhere.  When you watch the movie, just take note at how rapid the first 30 minutes of the movie are.  The film just plain sucks.And when the movie finally does slow down, it sloooowwws down-- and stretches out the insignificant parts of Ali's life and rushes over the important ones.  Did we really need all that Malcolm X junk?  Didn't Spike Lee already make that movie?  And didn't Spike Lee also play Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" when Malcolm was killed?  And shouldn't Michael Mann be getting a summons in the mail from Spike any day now?  Also, check out how Muhammad Ali's wives come and go.  They just pop on the screen without warning, nor introduction, and as soon as you realize what's going on, they have vanished, as if David Blaine stepped in as director.
As for Will's acting, it should not be praised.  Everybody in the cast does a better job acting than he does, including Jeffrey Wright as photographer Howard Bingham.  In this movie, Bingham barely has 2 lines, he just repeatedly (and repeatedly) takes snapshots and smiles (okay, he's a photographer, we get it!!!)  Will Smith's southern accent comes and goes, and gets hilarious early on in the movie.  Instead of Ali, he sounds a lot like Snagglepuss.  He even says ""Exit, stage left,"" but that scene was cut from the movie.  Jon Voight was nominated for an Oscar for playing Alfred E. Newman.  And I sincerely believe Jamie Foxx may hold the title as the world's least funny funnyman, and in this movie he shamelessly steals George Carlin's famous joke of how he never had a 10, but one night had five 2's.There is another part where Ali goes to Africa to face George Foreman in the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle"" match.  Michael Mann decides he wants to show Will Smith running for 7 hours, surrounded by screaming young fans.  This scene goes on and on, and by the time it was over, I was shocked to notice I had gray hair and a receding hairline.  Thanks a lot Michael Mann, I missed about 25 years of life.This movie is terrible and was a big disappointment.  If you want to watch a good movie about boxing, I suggest you rent D.C. Cab, Leprechaun, or Jack Frost.  These films are all great and at least you'll be able to follow what's going on.  They all have characters you will care about and feel sympathy for.  Ali has none of these elements, and if you happen to watch it while you're in your 60's, you just might wake up dead once it's over.* star out of 5.",Ali
143,Darth_Guybrush,Too much singing,7,4 November 2006,"Compared to Rocky, especially IV and V, it was not as dramatic. And I am certain that Ali was much bigger than Will Smith. There is also too much long segments of music backed pointedless. And sex scenes are also pointless.I certainly admire Muhammed Ali, and if you do too, you will be disappointed by this. Kudos to Will Smith for giving it a go - but there can be only one real Ali. I give it 5 out of 10 because of Will himself - the 5 point loss is due to the annoyingly long musical bits, love scenes, and Ali Bundeye (or something like that - translates to ""Ali Kill him"").Boxing is supposed to be a sport?",Ali

Never explains to viewers what the rope a dope was: against the ropes and covering up for much of the fight, Ali patiently waited while Foreman ineffectually hammered away at him.  And no one mentions later that this unreal ability to take punches may have caused his later Parkinsons to speed up.  Also - no mention of the phantom punch!  Unbelievable.",Ali
145,zwrite2,"""Ali"" misses essence of Ali",6,14 March 2008,"It's difficult to comprehend how ""Ali"" can be too long and incomplete, can feature an excellent portrayal of the world's most charismatic person and be boring, and have many riveting scenes, but fail as a drama.Yet, ""Ali"" is incomplete, boring, and a failed movie. The reason is that the movie misses a large part of the essence of Muhammad Ali.""Ali is often unfocused and unclear, bouncing from topic to topic and spending too much time on things like Ali's womanizing and an incredible 46 minutes in Zaire while ignoring large parts of his boxing career and inaccurately portraying some of his and The Nation of Islam's history.The movie should have focused on four areas where Ali was distinctive  his fight against the U.S. military, his religion, his personality, and his boxing ability. The movie includes a lot of material on all four of these subjects, but has a severe point-of-view problem.You can't understand the essence and impact of Ali without scenes which show how America viewed him. He was arguably the most HATED person in the USA for a few years in the 1960s and, perhaps, beyond and is now one of the most admired and popular people in the world. The transition was a result of Ali being extremely courageous, brash and charismatic.Yet, you'd never know from watching this movie that Ali was hated by the general public. Here is how I would have presented Ali and his distinctiveness:HIS FIGHT AGAINST THE MILITARY: I would have started the movie with Ali standing up to the U.S. government in 1966 when it drafted him into the Army and ended it with a scene showing how popular he became, perhaps the 1996 torch lighting ceremony at the Atlanta Olympics.Thus, I'd emphasize the powerful evading-the-draft scenes in ""Ali,"" add scenes that showed how Americans viewed him during the Vietnam War, and include flashbacks with Ali winning the Olympics and world title, experiencing the evils of segregation, and gravitating toward Islam.Returning to live action, I'd show how Ali sacrificed the three-plus best years of his boxing career because of his strong principles. Interspersing Ali's legal battles with evidence that Americans avidly supported the Vietnam War in 1966, but opposed it by 1971, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Ali, could convey how perceptions of ""The Greatest"" changed.HIS RELIGION: I'd be more explicit and accurate about how Ali joining The Nation of Islam contributed to Americans' hatred of him.The movie needed to explain the religion and Ali's theology more clearly (Ali saying ""I'll be who I want to be, not what you want me to be"" doesn't cut it) and show how Americans regarded Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, and the religion itself as racist and dangerous. I'd also cut out the government spook nonsense and accurately explain the Malcolm-Elijah tiff (Malcolm was expelled for condoning JFK's assassination) or drop the subject.HIS PERSONALITY: The movie did a good job of showing Ali's personality, but not how it offended millions of people. I'm too young to recall the war debate, but I remember how my father despised Ali in the 1970s because he regularly bragged about himself and denigrated others.Americans despise the selfish, arrogant athletes of 2008, but Ali's personality was far more selfish and arrogant than Barry Bonds' and others. ""Ali"" should have illustrated how Americans were turned off by Ali's personality by emphasizing his conflict with Joe Frazier. Millions sided with the hard-working, soft-spoken Christian. He still hates Ali, who called him a gorilla.HIS BOXING ABILITY: Ali was unique. He transformed the image of a profession dominated by inarticulate brutes who attacked and attacked because he had incredible defensive abilities, evasiveness, footwork, dancing, and athleticism as well as very fast hands.The movie shows little of his dancing  and certainly gives no evidence that this was distinctive. ""Ali"" needed to include perspectives of boxing analysts who could explain to viewers how truly great he was. It also should have had a five- to 10-minute ""Raging Bull""-style summary of his dozens of victories that weren't even mentioned.Interestingly, the boxing scenes were absolutely fabulous although they didn't convey the essence of Ali. They were extremely realistic unlike the rock 'em/sock 'em robot scenes of ""Rocky"" and other movies which show Boxer A smashing Boxer B 20 times in a row before somehow Boxer B comes back as if he hadn't been hit at all. I was so impressed by the ""Ali"" boxing scenes that I was tempted to go back to my review of ""Rocky"" and deduct a point.Where to cut? Well, Ali's womanizing was NOT distinctive. A huge percentage of famous people womanize. Ali was too interesting to dredge up his relationships, and they detract from the more interesting elements of his life. Yes, he said he was religious. Grow up America. Religious people cheat too  and always have.As for the 46 minutes on Zaire, if the Ali-Foreman battle was that interesting, it should be a separate movie. Wait a second. It was  ""When We Were Kings."" Forty-six minutes here is pointless repetition. Also: I don't care about Bundini Brown's personal problems. He should have been used to illustrate how he helped Ali become a quasi-poet.As I said in my first graph, the movie has many positive elements. Will Smith, for example, has Ali's cadences and attitude down pat and deserved an Oscar nomination. He doesn't quite convey his charisma, but no one can.I give ""Ali"" a 6.ZWrite",Ali
146,duanekimball,So when is the sequel?,5,18 February 2009,"I watched this with my son and wife since he was doing a report on Ali for school.I normally enjoy Will Smith movies and he does a good job portraying my ideal of Ali.However, there is little substance in this movie, even though it is more than 2 hours long.For one thing, the movie ends just after the George Foreman fight. He had 14 more fights after that. Apparently, Ali's life wasn't very interesting after 1974.There is ZERO relationship building with his corner... Jamie Foxx's character is built up a bit, but not much. His wives??? I guess they didn't play much of a role in his life. There was one sentence about him having affairs on the side.What happens is that the audience is suppose to be an educated audience. They are suppose to know the whole story already (i.e. rope-a-dope)Even the boxing was in slow motion. No excitement at all. Writer/Director: Hey, since they know the outcome already, let's just fill in this part.The political commentary...well, if you're going to do it..do it right!I only give it a 5 because Smith played a convincing role. No one should be giving this a 1 or 2, but no way is it a 9 or 10 either. ...right down the middle. If you have 2+ hours of your life to waste..have at it.",Ali

This movie, the blind musician (Ray?), and the Freddy Mercury biopic are all the same. They make it super simple with 1-2 minutes focusing on certain moments of his life, and off to the next one.

When i was walking out ofthe theatre i was asking people where was jon voight in this movie. i didn't see him. then they told me he was howard.  When that happens you know it is a great performance.  Mann turned what everyone thought was impossible into something that will acheive some great success. i mean, look at francis ford coppola.  with the godfather, I & II (i won't even go to III, cuz it is just to bloody bad), he was told it wouldn't come out good. it couldn't live up to anything.  it managed to win best picture and a slew of other awards.  that shows how much work everyone put into the movies. overall, this was a good movie, with funny parts from smith, and as well as great boxing sequences, that not since raging bull, a movie could live up to that standard. 9/10",Ali

Will Smith puts in the greatest performance in his career (SO FAR?!) and it shows that his really improved since WILD WILD WEST (The Legend Of Bagger Vance was good, maybe that's how his comeback started)! I still don't know about an Oscar, btu his already been nominated for best actor in a drama with a goldne globe and I hope he wins this! This will declare Will Smith as not only a top composer (UP YOURS EMINEM, I HATE YOU FOREVER...SORRY ABOUT THAT?!) but an actor as well!

152,Don Stephens,A Subtle Downhill Slide,6,29 December 2001,"For those who don't know boxing history, there are spoilers in this review.We open in an R & B club, and Sam Cooke is taking the stage and sings a medley of his best songs.  As we see the crowd in thrall to him, we cut back and forth, from one of the most electrifying men on stage to the most electrifying man ever to step into the ring, Muhammed Ali.  We see him train, and watch Sonny Liston dominate an opponent in the ring.  We watch the twinkle in Ali's (Will Smith's) eyes as he finds his destiny.This is the best part of Michael Mann's new biopic, simply named ""Ali."" D.P. Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful transitions from film to digital video, and Mann's direction of actors Smith, Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, and Ron Silver in muted camera filters and silence, provide a beautiful contrast to the fire of Cooke's music.  (One might sense that Mann is trying to imitate Scorsese, but is that really all that bad?)And from there, almost invisibly, it starts to go wrong.  For the first two hours of Mann's 157 minute opus, there is no wrong step taken.  Ali is shown as a contemplative and confused man who runs for comfort in all the wrong places; in adultery and a horde of yes-men who vanish without a trace when his license is revoked and rematerialize magically when he gets it back again.  Will Smith is fantastic both in trash-talk mode and in his brooding silences.  Some will say that Ali was not as stoic as Smith and Mann make him out to be, but you get no complaints of historical inaccuracies from me. I pity the fool who tries to get his history from motion pictures.Almost everything is covered.  His conversion to Islam, his refusal to cooperate in the draft, the subsequent suspension of his license, his first fight with Joe Frazier, his relationship with Howard Cosell, and ""The Rumble In The Jungle.""  It's that last one that gave me problems.  Imagine if you will, a long pane of glass going along a conveyor belt.  This pane is without blemish or smudge until the very edge of the pane is smashed by a hammer.  Not only does this ruin the edge, but makes cracks all the way through.The fight at the very end against George Foreman in Zaire, is the typical sports movie ending, where Smith takes a boat-load of punishment and then comes back to knock out his opponent.  This will inspire some people to clap in the theater, but that is a shallow response.  In the previous two hours of the film, we see Muhammed Ali as a flawed man trying to figure things out.  It was a sensitive and convincing portrait, but shouldn't that render a boxing victory meaningless?  They went from a potentially great film to the next ""Rocky"" sequel.  Michael Mann is a great director, whose ""Heat"" has a place right beside ""The Godfather"" in the pantheon of great crime films.  And his work on ""The Insider"" not only should have made more money, but was cheated out of a few Oscars.  There must have been Columbia executives breathing down his neck for a more upbeat ending, because you get the sense that Mann should have known better.  At least with all the money this movie will make, he can start work on his next masterpiece.**1/2 out of 4",Ali

For one thing, his characteristic mischievousness is not evident in the film.  Just looking at Ali made you feel good and happy (except if you were in the ring with him, I'm sure!)I found that Ali's opponents were incredibly well casted.

Smith deserves the Oscar nom he got. The essence of the boxer comes through, but the entire story is still awaiting lensing. Film should have been helmed by someone else.

The movie tends to spend a lot of time on one scene, then leaps ahead several months or even years with no explanation. Ali gets new wives and has kids, but the movie doesn't even stop long enough to let you know that he had gotten divorced from the previous wife.

This movie had the oppourtunity to go into Ali's entire life where he did real good things, instead I felt it was lazily put together with things that people already know, there was almost less things to take about ali's life in this movie than from When we were kings. I think the person who signaled this script only saw that documentary. The story lacked energy, something that Ali had a lot of, and all I kept feeling was depressed, depressed the story never went back to his childhood or after his win over George, depressed that will smith looked depressed the whole time making this movie, depressed the only dialog they gave us was from interviews that people have already seen. Nothing in this movie has filled in the blanks about ALi's life, except that he cheated on his wives. Something I would have not wanted to see, because it just didn't fit. He is one of my only heros and I was not once impressed with this movie at all, I had low expectations and they were fully satisfied watching it.A man that did so much, this movie did nothing for him.

I looked at my watch twice in the first half-hour of the movie, and twice during the ten-minute sequence of Ali running in Kishasha, which was a self-indulgent piece of under-edited crud. ""Look, everybody, it's REALLY Africa!""We aren't allowed to detect the drama of this moment, we're going to have every single emotion forced through Will Smith's face and body language. Too much. Exploring character does not mean devoting several hundred frames of film to a tight focus on the protagonist's tortured features. In Ali's case, much of that attempt to show him thinking could have been skipped.There were several much better scenes demonstrating character -- the byplay with Cosell, a fascination with termites on TV while Malcolm X has come to tell him something important, or walking away, momentarily silencing his motor mouth in bitter anger at someone else's lack of confidence.Other pacing oddities riddle the movie. We get to see every single bullet coming straight at Malcolm X's POV, but we're at a medium distance when Ali publicly voices his political concerns about the Vietnam war, wrapped up in one 20-second news conference. This is the emotional center of the film, and all of a sudden we're ten rows back?Timing issues aside, Will Smith finally fulfills the dramatic promise he made years ago in ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" living into a complex character who is both charismatic and human. I haven't seen all the competing performances this year, but his could easily be in the top five. Great job on sustaining the soft Kentucky cadence. Most of the supporting performances are excellent as well.But for a character study (with good places to hit fast-forward), you could wait for the rental. There are not enough visuals in here to make you rush to the big screen. A couple of the lighting choices are overdone (wow...everyone's BLUE!). I thought the boxing sequences were effective; Mann puts you right in the middle of the action without the cheat of too much slo-mo. But they would be nothing unusual for people who already watch a lot of boxing, and for people who don't like or watch boxing, it will be just as painful as you always thought.Final hint: if you're taking anyone with you under 40, sit together ahead of time for half an hour and review the history highlights of Ali's life. Without that, you might not keep up with the story at all...my 14-year-old nephew couldn't even figure out who had won the Ali-Frazier fight!",Ali
163,zakfar2000,Watchable,8,29 July 2011,"I'm a sports junkie, and I normally watch all the movies that are based on any kind of sports. For me, Muhammad Ali is one of the greatest sportsman of all time. You can call me his fan (even though I'm not much of a boxing guy).I liked this movie. Ali's character is handled greatly by Will Smith. But I feel something odd here. I believe the movie could have lot more than it actually had. I know, the movie was long (longer than 2 hrs). I think the script could have adjusted. I don't know why, but I didn't like this movie as much as I did 'Rocky'. I know someone would say that Rocky is a classical masterpiece. But I don't understand what stopped 'Ali' to be one? Why isn't it handled in the sense? It's understandable when a 'True Story' is being made on the real life hero, there are lots of limitations. But one thing is there though. In the life of Ali, there were many real ups and downs, and they could have been utilized more properly to bring bring better twists and climax.Well, the movie is good, and I will recommend it to all the fans of Muhammad Ali, or other fans of Sports Movies.",Ali

What a legend!",Ali
166,asteinfi2,good not great,7,29 June 2008,"Overall Michael Mann's choppy direction and a wandering script really hold back what could have been a great movie. Mann is obsessed with the music of the time period and while at times it does create a nice atmosphere, he also extends several scenes to unneeded length because of it. The script goes into great detail in certain areas of Ali's life, yet leaves other areas strangely glossed over. For instance, a great deal of time is spent on his father, whereas almost none is spent on the relationship between Ali and Joe Frazier, who many consider to be his greatest enemy, most interesting foil, and Ali's greatest triumph, yet the Thrilla in Manilla is not even mentioned.In the end, it works to a certain extent thanks to a wide range of excellent performances including, Jamie Fox, Jada Pinkett Smith, Ron Silver, Mykelti Williamson, Jeffrey Wright, and especially Jon Voight and Mario Van Peebles. The last two portray historic figures in their own right and give them the proper scope those men deserved, while still being deferential to Ali. Finally, Will Smith gives the finest performance of his career to date and continues to grow as an actor as he impersonates Ali perfectly while creating a flawed, but larger than life man who becomes a legend.",Ali
167,kyle_793,"Not a boxing movie, a landmark film",9,3 January 2002,"Well, if you went to Ali to see an boxing movie you might have been disappointed, but if you went to see a great film you hit the mark.  The hype was due.  A conglomerate of great acting, great direction, and a great story has made Ali a landmark film.  This film is socially important because it raises up one of the most notable and underappreciated figures of the twentieth century, Ali.  Many considered Ali just a boxer with a big mouth, but this film finally exposes him for what he truly was, one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our time.  The film makes subtle but amazingly-done comparisons between Ali and other civil rights leaders, notably Malcolm X, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and highlites Ali's influence with theirs. This theme is climaxed in the beautiful scene of Ali (Will Smith) running down streets in Africa with local chidren chanting his name.  At this moment in the film, we understand as viewers that Ali did not fight for fame or fortune, but he fought for his rights and the rights of all black people in the United States and the world.  No other film has exhalted Ali's influence in such a way.  It was beautifully done.  Ali will become one of my favorite films of all time, and I believe will be remembered years from now as the crowning achievement of both the main actor and the director.  I applaud their efforts",Ali
168,paulozavaleta-28773,Ali is great movie and One of Will Smith's best performance,10,30 June 2020,"Will Smith has pulled a power performance as the great Muhammad Ali, nobody else could have done like Will Smith. The movie maybe too long but it has some great boxing scene with a great cinematography by Mexican cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki",Ali
169,vol2,Ali is an interesting failure.,3,5 January 2002,"Ali is an interesting failure. A movie about an important historical figure such as Ali could have benefited from a straightforward, energetic approach. However, Mann's more artistic approach might have succeeded had the artistic elements complimented the subject matter. Michael Mann does not effectively create a biographical account, nor does he emphasize the action scenes. Instead, he chooses to make it a self-consciously artistic film. The narrative facts are obscured by the filmmaking which destroys the cohesion of the plot. The only consistent element left to cling to is Mann's characteristic slow pacing. Some of the artistic sequences are quite interesting, taken out of context. However, these lengthy sequences end up taking the place of narrative information that is so important that it hardly seems an appropriate sacrifice. Furthermore, by allowing the pacing of the movie to become so exposed, one cannot help but feel it drag on. One direct criticism I have is that the music was poorly chosen. The movie starts off in a good place with Sam Cooke, but many sequences feature background electronic music (it sounds very modern). If the film had stuck to a period soundtrack, the artistic elements would have tied in with the plot effectively. All of this aside, Will Smith gave an incredible performance as Ali, perhaps the best of his career. It's a shame that Mann did not make a movie to match the honesty of Smith's performance.",Ali
170,AVass0812,"Fell asleep, not once, not twice, but three times",4,7 June 2002,"What could've been a very interesting story and possibly a great movie with some very good acting, turned out to be a movie that was had to stay awake through. Ali's movie has the pace of a snail. I was totally bored within the first 30 minutes of the film. I fell asleep 3 times while watching this snore fest. I think the film editor and director have done a little too much boxing themselves and have begun to ""slow down"" in their mental skills. I cannot see why everyone thought that Will Smith should've won an Academy Award for this. He played Ali as a flat 2D character, should've thrown in Billy Dee Williams, at least he would have played him with more flare. Smith had more intensity in playing Jim West in Wild Wild West than he did in this film, and that character and movie really sucked. And Jon Voight...come on, as Howard Cosell? I know that Hollywood likes to get on these ""kiss their butt"" type of deals, but Voight's acting at Cosell was not the best. Jon Tuturo playing the great ABC sportscaster had more depth than Voight's pathetic attempt. Between Smith and Voight, I think you had both ends of a book shelf. Hopefully they'll come out with a Director's Edition of this film, or better yet...a ""Here's a better version"" edition of it. If you haven't seen it yet....DON'T...save yourself the rental. And you have, you should be demanding your money back for it. I'm so sorry they decided to wreck another 20th century icon of sports with a poor movie based on his life. And Smith is not the end all, be all of actors out there. Ok bud, you used to be the Fresh Prince, now we should call you the Fresh Snore.",Ali
171,robert-turner-1,Raging Bulls**t,5,30 September 2005,"""Ali"" is a decidedly average biopic which fails to do justice to a unique and often controversial sporting figure.Given that the years 1964 - 1974 were a monumental period of strife and upheaval in most Americans' lives - never mind someone like Mohammed Ali, the dramatisation of these events is a curiously dull and uninspiring affair.Characters are undeveloped; dialogue is flabby and inconsequential. For unnecessarily large portions of this movie, ""Ali"" resembles a pretentious and self indulgent pop video. In fact you could quite easily leave the room, return twenty minutes later, and discover that nothing of any great consequence has happened.Considering that this movie is almost three hours long, the audience's rapidly thinning patience is occasionally rewarded. The fight sequences (notably the legendary bouts with Sonny Liston) are tense and wonderfully choreographed. Will Smith also delivers an energetic and convincing character portrayal- which is just as well because he looks nothing like him.In short, a disappointing and over-hyped film. The definitive story of this remarkable human being remains to be written.",Ali
172,metsfandave86,Not the KO it could have been,5,12 August 2021,"Will Smith did a good Ali. The storyline was a little slow as it was mostly about his religious/political stance. They could have done more with the boxing and they barely touched the Ali/Cossell relationship. It came across like boxing was a side job. This is not a sports movie. This is a history lesson, political statement with a small mention of Ali being the greatest boxer of all time.",Ali
173,TSFive,"Regardless of the film itself, Will Smith's performance is nothing short of brilliant...",8,12 February 2002,"And I hope those that vote for the Oscars realize that. Regardless of the movie, which I didn't think was bad at all, The Academy Awards are based on performances, and should stay that way. The reason I am talking about The Oscars is because Will Smith was nominated today, along with others for their performances. He deserves the award much more. While the movie became tough to follow and somewhat (yes, only somewhat, it still went by very fast) lengthy, that reflects in no way on Will Smith's incredible performance. He was perfect, and did an excellent job. So regardless of peoples opinions, their ""favorite actor"", and the ignorance that swirls around movies like this nowadays because people think so negatively, Oscar or no Oscar, Will Smith gives the performance of 2001.",Ali

Great acting, especially by Peebles, and Silver in a quieter role. And Voigt's depiction of Howard Casell is right on target. The film draws you in, and keeps you truly interested. However,the film's sudden ending is unforgivable. If you are going to tell a story about Muhammamed Ali, why not do it right, and go all the way. Instead, we get a quick cut off after the Rumble in the Jungle. Still, this film is underappreciated. I give it 7/10",Ali
175,MugseyGrant,A True Legend A True Film.,8,10 August 2016,What an amazing film I really don't know where to start or finish with this one. But what we already know is Mohammed Ali was a true sports legend. The film showed all highs and lows and the real points of his career. A real watch for any film lover and one of the greatest films of 2001. You have an amazing actor none other than Will Smith who fits the role perfectly. A great fast telling story that stings like a bee and along with it some of the greatest scene in a film that contains boxing. The small soundtrack might be limited but fits the film greatly. If any film derserve an award back in 2001 then this one did with amazing amount of wins you can see why this was such a great film about the legend. There really not much more to say it highlights the situations Ali faced in his younger years right down where he proved just how great of a fighting legend he truly was and why he was such a legend to a genration in the present days. He did what any man would do and fighted not just America but to rank as the top man.,Ali
176,pete-323,Well worth a look.,10,10 February 2002,"I can't believe the amount of bad-mouthing this movie is getting from IMDb users. Do you not get the point of a Biopic? This is a fraction of the life of Ali, this is an insight into his life - it is not trying to give you an understanding of the man. Michael Mann is showing you what the guy did, and allowing you to make up your own mind whether you want to like him or not. why do you have to care about him? So he's a womaniser... so what? he's a boxer - the GREATEST boxer. the guy has flaws - like any other human being. thats what makes the movie so accessible, and so great - you see the man for who he is: his beliefs, his desires, his ambitions, his loves and his hates. Kudos to Will Smith for an Oscar-worthy performance, and for Mann who allows the film to show a man holding on to as many of his principals as he can - failing in some, succeeding in others. Yes, it may be too long, and it will alienate some of the audience, but the audience who DOES get that a film doesnt ALWAYS need a plot which starts at A and ends at B with closure and a happy resolution, will enjoy this film for a its quality direction, performances and stronghold on the material to produce a great film.",Ali

178,enoonmai,Mission: Impossible?,6,25 October 2004,"Although this film was too long, it missed out the beginning and end of the Ali story. The omission of Clay being refused service in a diner upon his return from the Olympics and the 'Thrilla in Manila' leave huge holes in the make-up of the man and icon that is Muhammad Ali.The fight scenes are superbly choreographed using real boxers and this is part of another problem with the film  is it a documentary or a movie?. As a boxing fan, I had difficulty believing that his opponents were who they were supposed to be - Joe Frazier was James Toney with an afro wig and never had me believing that he was Joe Frazier.Overall, this film dealt well with Ali's womanising and relationship with 'Bundini' Brown and Howard Cosell but was superficial and left me unfulfilled. Maybe this was mission impossible but the movie set out ambitious targets and missed most of them. You are better off getting a video of Ali's fights, watching 'When We Were Kings' and reading his biography by Thomas Hauser.",Ali

I was waiting for the plot to get me somewhat excited to focused.  Unfortunately I never sat up during the whole movie.  Will Smith had a decent acting appearance and shouldn't be too proud about the movie, since it was a once and a lifetime opportunity to depict the greatest boxer of all time, and it didn't clome close to the potential.

Believe me when I tell you, he is just as great and as charismatic as we all think he is. It was truly hard for him to be in such a position, as champion of the World, only because that much fame and success always means making some choices. Take the big money or risk losing everything because or your total commitment to The Civil Rights Movement? To be for or against and obviously unjust war in Vietnam? He had to choose between the best and easiest life or one of conflict and the worst choice of all, standing up for your beliefs including those which meant going to prison and possibly losing everything. But Ali will always stand as a world champion of people -- whatever that means. That might be why he is possibly the most famous person in the world. The film's entertaining.Dick Gregory is more than a friend and counsel to Ali. They have agreed that African Americans had a calling just as Dr. King did. Though it caused Ali many potentially successful years as an champion. Ali and Gregory made their work part of their calling and they have made an indelible mark on the history and the evolution of The Civil Rights Movement and the truth about what happened to America as a result of our being in Vietnam. This is a film that everyone should see -- particularly if they are confused about racism. This is an historic film as well as one that entertains from the first frame to the last.",Ali
182,pwahl,disappointing,5,13 February 2002,"I'm a big Michael Mann fan, had anyone else directed this not even sure I would have gone to see it.  But, I don't think he succeeded with this one. Maybe Ali is just to familiar to me, but I kept seeing Will Smith playing Ali, not Ali himself.  I also thought he looked a bit small, did not have the more physically imposing presence that Ali had.Regarding the story, the final fight with Foreman was dealt with in a much better manner in the documentary ""When We Were Kings"", so I found that segment already familiar and disappointing.  The movie never really gave me a sense of why he became such a popular figure, his rise to world wide fame is something the movie did not attempt to deal with.  Also an odd flow to the movie, little narrative, I didn't even know what city Ali lived in until he was introduced as the Louisville slugger, the end of his first marriage dealt with in a minute or so, and his appeal to his jail sentence dealt with only peripherally, no sense of how long that went on or how he ultimately won an 8-0 victory in the Supreme Court (as an aside, there are 9 justices, wonder what happened to number 9).",Ali
183,banosd,Not that bad at all,7,29 December 2001,"First of all, this movie is not as bad as others have said.  The boxing scenes were fantastic and more realistic then any of the Rocky's were.  You can't say the story writing is bad when it is an autobiographical picture either.  There was only so much they could put into it.  Considering I was like 11 years old when Ali won his 3rd belt, I remember him being a great fighter that bounced around a lot.  He was ugly to watch for the most part but effective.  And the movie caught that.  Will Smith did a great job too getting buff and mimicking his moves in the ring.    But the movie was uneven and a little long so my suggestion is to have fun with the actor's portrayals in this movie.",Ali
184,segstef,"excellent acting,despite fair screenplay",6,30 December 2001,"The acting makes the movie. Some scenes were too long and meaningless. The movie tried to be a documentary.

The fight sequences were well staged.",Ali
185,deanmasters,A tall order,7,28 December 2001,"""Ali"" left me feeling flat.   It seemed as if I had seen the story of a man whom everyone had forgotten, instead of a man that most still remember. Ali, in the film, seemed constantly confused and unsure of himself.  I believe Michael Mann wanted to play up this side of Ali since it was the side hidden from public view, but the result was that Ali seemed like less of a legend, and more of a lost soul.  Mann spends a good deal of the film (far too much in my opinion), with musical montages showing the bewildered face of Will Smith, to help illustrate Ali's inner angst.  These scenes don't help move the story, and made it difficult to tell whether the Ali was thinking, or just dim-witted. The part of Ali was played admirably by Smith, but it was difficult for me to get beyond the fact that I was observing an actor playing the part, instead of the great champion himself.  This was either due to Smith's inability to capture Ali completely, Mann's distracting direction, or the fact that Muhammad Ali himself is far too big a personality to accurately portray on film.  Likely, a combination of all three things. I had the opportunity to meet Muhammad Ali briefly a year ago.  Despite being hobbled by Parkinson's Disease, there was still something incredibly powerful and majestic about the man.  It was a twinkle in his eye, or an aura that was difficult to describe.  I don't feel that this was captured in `Ali'.  I am too young to have seen Ali in his prime, but I have watched all his great fights (and some of his lesser ones) on video or television. There is a good documentary, `When We Were Kings', that is about the fight where Ali regains the title against Foreman in Zaire.  I would recommend that to any who are interested in the real Muhammad Ali.",Ali

Coming on twenty years old, this movie may have gotten lost in the shuffle, so maybe its time to dust it off. Ali's story is one of the most important of the 20th century, controversial yes, necessary most certainly, a fearless man with fists and a mouth like no other, slam-bang in the middle of the most charged time of our modern Americana lore, the 60s, when the dried husk of centuries past was primed to peel before a new and diverse century. The eponymous man is played by Will Smith, in a fierce performance, with balls the size of cannon-shot to even attempt to tackle the legend that is Muhammad Ali. The camera work here is in top form, thanks to the ever impressive Emmanuel Lebezki, with iconic visuals and captivating fights. And even though there might be something more to be desired from this sprawling film, the history here is spot on, with director Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, Collateral) pulling it all together in proficient form. This film should be found among the finest boxing movies ever made. But I fear it will be lost in the shuffle.

His life story, the victories against Sonny Liston, conversion to Islam and subsequent suspension and return to the ring, has been told and retold in movies, documentaries and books, ad nauseum. The question then is what could Ali tell us about the real Ali that we don't already know? The answer, unfortunately is nothing.Will Smith, who looks nothing like the real Ali, has the unenviable task of portraying a man whose face and voice are seared into our collective subconscious. He tries hard, but I did not for one minute believe that Smith was really Ali. He is also unable to duplicate Ali's incredible grace and speed in the ring. Jon Voight, of all people, plays Howard Cosell wearing what looks like a Halloween mask.

Was it about Ali's history of his bouts with opponents like Joe Frazier, Sonny Liston, or George Foreman?  Or was it about Ali's political views?  Or was it about Ali's battle with the US government regarding his objection to the military draft?The plot cuts between these 3 veins without a clear direction.  You don't know what the movie is about.  It certainly doesn't look like a biography of Ali.To make things worse, Will Smith was seriously miscast as Ali.  Smith tries to match Ali's dialect and mannerisms but without the excitement and energy that Ali had.  Muhammad Ali was a controversial sports figure at the time, representing black Muslims, someone who would speak his mind before thinking.  Smith tried to match that but instead his performance comes off flat.  It's not all his fault - the script makes Smith pensive in far too many scenes.All in all, a movie to avoid.

As confusing as that last sentence may sound I think some people missed the point on this film. They seem to have expected to see Ali's entire history, or Ali's greatest fights, or their personal memories of Ali but what they got instead was what drove the man through the years that defined him. What made him the fighter who wouldn't let Geogre Foremen, or the American Government, beat him.

And after watching this film, I think it was done pretty well...it showed the good and the bad sides of Ali and what his life was like. I would have liked it better if a smaller actor played Ali instead of Will Smith as this film should have focused more on the life of Ali instead of being fueled by the fact that Will Smith was Ali.

193,Aragorn___,very moving and believable,7,11 August 2002,"I love a good biography film and Ali is at times masterful in many ways and portrays all the parts of Muhammed Ali, not just the dazzling boxing life he led which is often used above his deep inner anguish at the prejudice in America.Will Smith is the only person in my opinion who could've played Muhammed, you can tell that he really wanted to play the part just by looking at his actions throughout the movie; it's deeply obvious that he's studied Muhammed in depth and this worked wonders on screen.  While the fight scenes are not on the same level as perhaps the Rocky films this should not be downplayed as they're excellently executed with a beautiful blend of action, excellent music and banter between Ali and also between Ali and his own mind.Overall i'm glad that this movie didn't focus on Ali's boxing career, moreover i'm glad that it highlighted his personal life, it's trials and tribulations and it's anguish at the events going on around him.  Certain scenes like Ali running through the shanty towns of Kinshasa really evoke Ali's feelings for the oppression around him and how he's become a hero of freedom and independence to them.  It truly is remarkable.  My only quaam with the film is that it is in certain places slightly vague in it's descriptions of characters.  For example, if a person (how this could happen, i do not know) had never heard of Ali or his story then they would be mystified at some of the characters because little is explained or highlighted about some characters throughout the film.  This is as expected however, because the makers clearly had the idea that everyone watching would have a vague idea of who each person is, i mean, how could you not in a sense?But other than that, a great film and an accurate biography.  Well done, I recommend it!",Ali
194,fieldy,...yawn...,1,15 September 2002,"Somewhere along the line, it somehow got forgotten that a film should be entertaining. Whoever was responsible (I guess director Michael Mann, who also directed the great film 'The Insider') must have just got so swept up in the life of Ali that it slipped his mind.The film is so long and boring I found it hard to keep my eyes open. Previously I didn't know that much about Ali's life, and unfortunately I think a lot is assumed, because it just skips absent-mindedly from one scene to the next, without much really happening. At times it is like we are seeing a 'best of' of Ali's life, and those reviews that praise how authentically the scenes of the movie recreate those from news footage of Ali only go to back up this point.The film is obviously well-made, and all the actors do a pretty good job, but it's just so damn BORING!",Ali
195,ctroed,What went wrong??,7,22 February 2002,"This movie was a massive failure. When I go to a movie about somebody I know almost nothing about, I expect to know a fair bit about that person after the movie is over. Well I still know very little about Ali. At the end of most scenes, I asked myself ""what just happened?"" or ""what did he/she say?"". This is not a good sign. In interviews, Will Smith said he had to learn all about being muslim....why??? I learnt absolutely nothing about it from this movie, just that apparently the leaders of the faith wanted Ali's money. Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" was a terrific movie that gave me tremendous insight into that situation. So why has he failed this time?",Ali
196,shailen,"Will Smith Great, movie just ordinary.",6,26 December 2001,"Will Smith portrayed Ali almost perfectly! And I believe he deserves and Oscar or at the most a nomination.  However, the story even though at times had its movements, but was most of the time was just lame and ordinary.  I think this is an just above average movie.",Ali
197,MySportsComplex,"Ali: Acting a Knockout, Storyline with rubber hands",4,4 March 2011,"Michael Mann's 3-hour epic about one of the greatest and most charismatic athletes of the 20th Century was an ambitious project and a noble venture, but falls hard. Too bad this film, Ali, was boring and almost as hard to endure as Oprah's Beloved. Sadly, this film, with bold aim and a careless hand largely missed the mark.Will Smith displays his best and most studied acting as Muhammad Ali himself, along side other great actors who play titan roles. Jon Voight as sportscaster legend Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X also shine. Still the dramatic potency of the cast is weighed down by the storyline's inertia.Perhaps what doomed the film was that the timeline stuck militantly to Ali's life between the years of 1965 to 1975. Unfortunately, much of what was shown of this decade focused less on boxing and more on personal affairs, as it spent much time on Ali being banned from the sport and scorned by the establishment for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War. And while (in real life) Ali's court case went on for years during his ban from the sport, the film didn't go the route of The People Versus Larry Flint, focusing on intellectual ventures surrounding the legal fight.Besides the great acting, the only high spike in Ali is the scene surrounding the Rumble in the Jungle fight that took place between Ali and George Foreman, in Zaire in 1975. Here, Mann does deserve some credit for transitioning his underlying assertion –that Ali was a universal and influential American icon—to the build up and anticipation about this legend challenging and beating the new champ Foreman.Like most sports fans, I wanted to see this charismatic, inspirational man and prolific athlete fight titans in the ring, not fighting sociopolitical causes or punching wind against partisan apparitions. Maybe shame on me for wanting Ali to be more like Rocky and less like Against All Odds.written by Andy Frye, MySportsComplex.blogspot.com",Ali
198,mcravener,"Floats Like a Butterfly, Stings Like a Bee - NOT",4,2 January 2007,"I was looking forward to this film, especially after reading some of the reviews here, and had hopes of getting an idea of Muhammad Ali the Man beyond Ali the Icon, but came out with neither. The film covers Ali's first world pro heavyweight title fight against Sonny Liston in '64 and ends in The Rumble in the Jungle against Foreman in '74, with the Vietnam controversy in the middle. Turbulent times which the director Michael Mann unsuccessfully portrays.Some reviewers here have applauded Will Smith's portrayal of the charismatic, dynamic and quick-thinking boxer. I can't say Will Smith did a bad job, but the film worked against his efforts. The film has too many characters, and too many characters without personality. When you place the world champion boxer side to side with other icons like Malcolm X, Don King, Howard Cosell and Martin Luther King some personality description has to give. Unfortunately it turned out to be all the protagonists lost - at times Mohammad Ali the person was no more than a lackluster cut-out figure around which the other icons of the time revolved.The cinematography was sombre, dark and lethargic. The musical score is similarly a heavy-handed monotonous base, indicating a misplaced mood of impending doom (!). The director Michael Mann has used this type of scoring to great effect in films like Manhunter (1986) and Heat (1995) - here it simply is formulaic and confusing. OK so the director wanted to describe a dark period in American history with race riots and the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King but this was never fully explored. There is also a lack of emphasis on boxing in the film, which would be OK if it was replaced with a new and interesting point-of-view, but here it just was sacrificed to no end.It's hard for me to recommend this film to anyone. Someone new to Ali's greatness would never get it from the movie. Someone who has more than a fleeting acquaintance with Ali's life will be confused by how the period of 1968-1974 is misrepresented.I have to agree with director Spike Lee's comment - how can it be possible to make a boring movie about one of the most exciting figures of the 20th century?",Ali
199,nickcrandall,Will Smith is an interesting choice..,6,7 February 2020,"I know this movie came out nearly 20 years ago, but I recently re watched it, and wanted to share my thoughts. First off, if you've never seen it, and like Ali, it is definitely worth watching. Production and directing are both really well done. It does feel a tad bit too long, and can feel dragged out in different scenes. All in all, the acting is pretty good, especially Jamie Foxx. I didn't love Will Smith cast as Ali. Throughout most of the movie it definitely felt like you were watching Will Smith play Muhammad Ali, rather than trying to see it through Ali's eyes. In some scenes where he had to act cocky, and confident, it reminded me of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. The boxing scenes were definitely Smith's strong suit. All in all though, like I said if you're interested, it's definitely worth the watch.",Ali
200,Sam_Focak,He just wasn't that interesting a guy,6,25 December 2001,"In another stroke of good luck this past week, I was on my way to a movie that I didn't really want to see when I got handed a pass to a sneak preview for a movie I was looking forward to -- Michael Mann's Ali, starring Will Smith.It is clear that Smith worked hard for this role -- he trained for six months to become a boxer, not just to look like one.   He has the trademark Ali mannerisms, often times sounding just like him, and occasionally even looking like him.   It's too bad that it turns out Ali just wasn't that interesting a guy.   The performance itself was impressive, but the overall experience really wasn't that good.I usually enjoy Mann's directing style, I like the slow-paced detailed storytelling he did in The Insider, but it just didn't work in Ali. In three hours, I felt like I really didn't know much more about the man than I did going in, and that's not a whole lot of information. Either Mann didn't manage to delve inside Ali's ""head"" or there just wasn't that much to say about his motivations.They seem to gloss over some of the most defining moments of Ali's life, like his involvement with Malcolm X, but then spend torturous amounts of time delving into the most insignificant events that really don't lend you any insight. I really wanted to like this movie, I remember growing up watching Ali on TV, and vaguely remember the controversy around him, I hoped Mann would really blow the cover off the stories and myths, but this time around, he fails to land the knockout punch.",Ali
201,paulod21,WILL SMITH COMES OF AGE!,8,7 May 2002,"With the making of this movie, I feel that we can finally say that Mr. Smith has truly ""come of age"" as an actor !  He played the part of a person so steeped in our psyche, with an admirable sense of the man that Ali was then. Up till now, I always felt that Mr. Smith was a rather light-weight actor....I happily retract that slur on his rep!!!",Ali
202,guigui-paul,another great film from the Genius Michael Mann!,9,6 February 2005,"A box office failure and some lukewarm reviews in 2001,but ""Ali"" is in my opinion a very good and underrated film. Mann's direction is great as usual: you just have to watch and to admire the wonderful 10 first minutes and the incredible bouts scenes with Liston and Foreman to understand that Mann is one of the most stunning directors working nowadays. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work is also inspired and beautiful,and the overall casting is very good: Will Smith gives here an unexpected,great and complex performance,and Jon Voight,Mario Von Peebles and Jamie Foxx are also very good. The story is dense and sometimes really moving (the last half in Africa is especially successful,with the heartbreaking jogging scene and the great finale),""Ali"" is a beautiful film...see it!",Ali
203,fbennett,Could have been great,4,3 January 2002,"The best thing about this movie is the actors. Wil Smith was a great Ali. As were the both unrecognizable Mario Van Peebles (Malcom X) and Jon Voight. And, Jamie Fox gave a memorable performance as Bundini. This movie had some really beautiful moments between characters, but all were under developed and in many cases they didn't bother identifying the characters (who was Paul Rodrigez supposed to be?) This film left me wondering what Muhammed Ali was really like. At times they seemed to forget to focus on Ali. Oh yeah, and someone should take out whoever's responsible for the shaky camera shots. It was worse than the Blair Witch Project.",Ali
204,lnormp,PURE TRASH,1,26 December 2001,"As with most, no all will smith movies, this was not a film about Ali but a film about will smith. At least he didn't look so sickly and scrawny as he did in ""Wild, Wild West"" Because negative numbers are not allowed, 1/10. It is too bad that a film about a powerful if misguided figure in American sports history, would be so incredibly lame.",Ali
205,greeniebrow,Smith as Ali,10,26 September 2020,Cant believe how long its been since ive seen this yet its still fresh in my mind. Wil smith gives a powerful performance as Ali. Some if the critic's were a bit harsh but overall this is a fantastic movie.,Ali
206,bandonbeachbum,Is God awful a rating.,1,29 December 2001,"This movie made no sense. Its starts with Sam Cooke singing loud in nightclub and I could not hear any talking over most of the music blaring. Ali is supposed to be the champ but he lives in a rat dive apt and is broke yet they never say if the muslims stole all of his money.This movie spends way too much time on the Muslim crap, which isn't too popular after Sept 11th. And he goes through women like toliet paper. There are flashback scenes that make no sense and are we really to believe he get a divorce because his wife wore makeup.They should have spent much more time on his wild press conferences. They left out the one when he fights Joe Frazier. Ali's greatest comments is when he was insulting Joe Frazier and it Mann only gave it 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead he spends the entire movie around the Muslim influence.
He gets off the plane in Zaire, and the people immeditately start chanting Ali Bumaye which is not accurate. Ali started that chant himself. When we were kings was a documetary that is about 100x better than ALI.
Mykilti Williamson is awful as Don King. Ving Rhames was much better in the tv movie Only in America.  I cannot imagine Mykilti in anything other than Bubba telling Forrest about lemon and pineapple shrimp.And I could not understand one thing Jamie Foxx said as a worthless Ali corner man. Ron Silver was not believable as Angelo Dundee and Paul Rodriguez doesn't have one line as Ferdie Pachenko.Mann should have included the fun things surrounding Ali including the great Dean Martin Roast to Ali. Instead this movie is a downer.I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was totally unimressed",Ali
207,ive-5,Mann does the impossible in the best possible way,9,12 March 2002,"Mann has tried to do the impossible: to make a bio pic about one of the most charismatic people of the last century. This enterprise, everybody will agree, could have utterly failed so easily. In my opinion, Mann has done the impossible in the best possible way. Mann's movie is flawed, of course. But could anyone have done a better job ? I doubt it.Will Smith is not Ali, but he does an amazingly fine acting job. He does not ooze Ali's mesmerizing charisma - how could he ? -, but he does bring depth to the role. Michael Mann remains undisputably a director of genius. It does not show for the whole length of the film, but it does in many parts. The cinematography is, as one would expect, magnificent and the boxing scenes are the best I have ever seen. This is a moving tribute to a remarkable man. Make sure you see it. My score: 9/10",Ali
208,reinout_vanschie,Truly an incredible piece of cinema,10,8 September 2002,"I personally think this movie was one of the best of last year. As a biopic it might be interesting to compare this movie with Beautiful Mind, that other biopic that won too much awards. I often thought about, what if Ron Howard,together with his writer made Ali, how would that movie be? Because Ali's life can be told in a very Beautiful Mind'esque way.Show how Ali became the greatest, then let his world fall, show how he begins suffering from his disease, until he has to stop boxing, and end the movie with some sort of heroic end moment, maybe an award show, where Ali get's an award like, sportsman of the decade/century whatever (I don't actually know if he ever got something like that, but it's just an example). Can you see where I'm going?Now if you look at Ali, how this movie turned out, you see it's a complete different movie. They don't show Ali getting sick, they show only 10 years of his life, the 10 years that transformed him from a Good boxer to a Legend.By limiting it's storytime to these 10 years, I think Michael Mann, succeeded in not making Ali sentimental. When we leave the theater we don't feel pity for Ali because he had such a hard life, like we did have in a sense with John Nash in B.mind. We leave the theater in a state of awe. The movie shows us how Ali became a legend. How he struggled and fought, and we never pity him, Ali is to powerfull a personality to pity, we respect him, and given that Ali is very much real and alive in the real world, we can't help but to look up to that person.However, the movie doesn't glamourize Ali, it doesn't make of him a flawless larger-than-life hero. By portraying his troubled relations with his many girlfriends/wifes, how he more than once let himself be used by others etc. the movie shows Ali was human. It doesn't shy away of his questionable relationship with The Nation of the Islam, for instance. Just as Ali in real life probably wouldn't hide those facts.Now to come to the practical aspects of this movie...because Ali is truly a magnificent film. Of course Smith plays Ali incredible, and if you compare him to footage of the real Ali, when he was about 20/30 years, you see just how close he comes to recreating Ali. But next to him we also have Jon Voight, Jaimi Foxx, Mario van Peebles, all playing so completely in-character that you hardly recognize them as actors. Then there is Mann's directorial power. From the brilliant opening 10 minutes, to the truly awe-inspiring, moving, scenes in Africa at the end, Mann carefully directs this picture, never making it dull, but also never forcing plotlines. He tells the story so subtle, you won't ever feel like he thinks that you as an audience can't understand something unless it's explained in big bright words. If someone breaks down in tears, he won't compliment this with violins in the background, soft-focus or whatever, he just shows a person breaking down. And I like this style incredibly well, especially in a biopic like this.So to come to a conclusion, Ali is indeed a masterpiece. Not as instantly accesible as the Insider or Heat, and not as conventional as Beautiful Mind, but in it's own right one of the (not THE:) greatest Biopic's yet made.",Ali
209,soefikos,is M. Ali as idiot as that?,4,15 March 2002,"this film was a big disappointment, it made Ali look like a real simple-minded guy. Example: he didn't go to the army because they drafted him as Cassius Clay? I am sure it was not like that. But the film really makes him look like someone who just obsessed with a couple of thins and was just too stubborn or simply too idiot to let go. There are a couple of interesting scenes in the film, and the matches are interestingly filmed, but otherwise this is a really long, really slow movie that wants to say a lot about a lot and finally manages to pass its hero as the village idiot. Will Smith did a good job in gaining weight, but finally it's still Will Smith with a funny voice. Not that he didn't try - but he has too strong a personality himself, he's too known to convince as Ali. It is a real pitty, I am sure the film does not do honour to Mr Ali. Even if he is as extravagant a personnality, he cannot be as stupid!",Ali
210,Redblok,Making it short and sweet,4,26 December 2001,"Smith gives a terrific performance about the life and times of one Muhammad Ali (aka Cassius Clay), but the movie lacks the momentum to give the viewer any real definition as to the purpose of the film.  Certainly it's a tribute to the great boxer, but there is no entertainment value in watching the brilliance of Ali onscreen.  There is nobility in the effort the actors give in order to make the movie authentic (and it is, in spades!) but there is just no reason for you to feel connected or moved at any time during the film.I saw this movie and left the theatre feeling somewhat conflicted.  On one hand I saw a fantastic and believable performance by Smith, while on the other hand the movie lulls and goes nowhere. I simply did not enjoy this movie at all, I left the theatre feeling 5 bucks lighter and not moved a bit.",Ali
211,kary_david,Michael Mann captures an American sporting legend,7,15 March 2002,"Michael Mann's 'Ali' hasn't won many plaudits however I thought it had plenty to offer. I found many strands and elements to the portrait, that was effectively brought out in the fine acting performance by Will Smith. What stood out above all was the absolute pride and brashness of Ali. Here was a man always on fire, brimming with confidence. Some of his opponents set themselves up for defeat when they baited him, calling him Cassius Clay, his ancestors' slave name, rather than his Islam ordained name, Muhammed Ali. Ali was never going to cop anyone being condescending to him. Ali was super slick on his feet and even more slick with his brain. He was lethal at press conferences, showing as little mercy in them as he did in the ring. Ali and famous sporting broadcaster Howard Cossell developed a friendship however Ali was unrelenting in the barbed invective he threw at him. Ali, certainly stung like a bee sometimes! I found it interesting the way Ali's relationship with women was portrayed. His hotheadedness and charisma meant that he never had any problem making relationships with women. Keeping relationships was something altogether different. His arrogance and innate conservatism, fuelled by his religious faith, destroyed many relationships. Other themes that came across was Ali's strong, religious stance, converting from the Christianity he was brought up in, to change to Islam, and his strong sense of racial pride, captured best in the Zaire scenes. By no means a perfect film but one worth seeing and it gives  one a little more of an insight into a unique, brilliant character.",Ali
212,studio-213,"Love Smith but he ain't Muhammad, Michael Mann wasn't the man",4,5 July 2009,"Let's start with Mr. Smith. Smith has really come a long way. He is good no matter what people say. ""I am Legion"" etc etc. He is committed to the art. But he is not qualified, no matter how much I love him, to play Muhammad Ali. He did look a little like him and I appreciate the level of skill it took to take on the role. However as one commentator said at no point did he stop being Will Smith and become Muhammad Ali. I avoided this film for years because I knew I would be disappointed. Well I finally saw it and I made the mistake of watching it with the top rate ""When we were kings."" Now if anyone reading doesn't understand acting let me give an example of what an actor should do. In the film where Angela Basset played Tina Turner, by the end of the film I was convinced that Angela was the real Tina Turner. When the end showed the real Tina I actually said ""Is that Tina turner?"" Angela did such a job it was unbelievable. I don't know why my boy Mario was Malcolm apart from looking a little like him (height etc) he was pretty poor. Now the film I think was balanced but M Mann isn't the Man. Yes you had to include the current events around Muhammad, how can you take Muhammad out of the environment and treat him as he wasn't a product of it? So the film took the correct path in re-counting that period in history. Regardless of how many times we have seen King and X and the Nation they are all relevant to Muhammad Ali, critical for the film. Some minor historical facts were blurred and they were small but silly mistakes; there was no white co-pilot on the plane. The original video was clear, so why put one white face in the plane when it contradicts the message of why Ali was impressed? You are dealing with subject matter like this show some respect. And I love West African music, but Ali didn't fight in West Africa, he was in Congo, so why the music which wasn't relevant to that history? Naturally I think an African-American director would have been better. The film didn't hold together well at all. But Smith did try but as a whole the film lacked spirit. M Mann is amazing with those Mohican boys and stuff, and even better with Heat but this stuff no no.",Ali
213,cincinnaticobra,This movie wasn't the Greatest,7,20 April 2004,"This movie wasn't the Greatest, but it was good.  Of course Muhammad Ali is a very interesting person, so there is a lot of material to work with when writing a script in his life. The biggest problem is deciding what to keep out. Many people (probably non-boxing fans) think there was too many fight scenes and that the movie dragged. It didn't seem that way to me. The pace seemed to be fast enough. You also have to remember that since Ali fought in an era of great heavyweights, he naturally would have a lot of important fights. In fact one criticism of the movie that I do have is that it ended after the George foreman fight and before his 3rd fight with his greatest rival, Joe Frazier.  His 3rd fight with Frazier was probably the greatest heavyweight fight of all time. Perhaps more importantly, it was an crucial chapter in a great rivalry and told a lot about each man. In fact there was a book written recently just about this fight. Will Smith did a better job that expected. He has come along way from that ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" crap. The supporting cast, especially Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, was excellent. Ron Silver as trainer Angelo Dundee was good, but didn't get enough camera time. One thing that the movie could have done better was show how Ali had grown, both as a boxer and as a man. In his early 20's he was a fun loving kid. After he joined the Nation of Islam, he gradually became more angry. Then after he left the Nation of Islam he started to be funny again, though in a slightly more mature way than when he was young. It sill puzzles me that many people thought that he was serious when he would go into one of his bragging routines. He was just trying to build up interest in the fight. Fortunately, most people knew he was kidding. As a boxer he changes as well. When he was young, he just his his phenomenal athletic gifts to beat opponents. As he aged and his skills declined, he used his heart and his brain to win. The movie really only touches on these things. Still, over all it was interesting and worth renting. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Ali
214,pete-563,Ali... we're no closer to understanding him.,5,26 September 2005,"I'm sure when Michael Mann walked off set he made a good film, but in the version I saw there was no fluidity.

A fatter bloke should have played the corner man ""Boudein"". Also the haircut on ""Gerry Quarry"" was superb ! I was hoping his hair would spin round on his head.Where was Ken Norton, or for that matter Henry Cooper or Joe Bugner! We never got to know Ali....why he became a boxer? did he love it.. or hate it.

Especially interesting - given the current atmosphere in the US - was the depiction of Ali's refusal to be drafted to Vietnam and getting branded as anti-patriotic. No surprise, of course, but still sickening to watch how Ali was identified for methodical destruction by the US government, and how the Nation of Islam used him and dropped him when convenient.Terrific soundtrack and cinematography.

The directing unfortunately is not that great (especially from a movie that is supposedly an Oscar candidate), where at times, one felt the camera was being shaken too much and too often in order to create that ""authentic"" feel. In addition, when looking at Will Smith one cannot stop remembering him being a naughty kid nephew, fighting aliens, or driving fast cars - which obviously does not help with the authenticity of creating Muhammed Ali.One could say that the good points come from the fight scenes, and at times Smith does vaguely resemble Ali (in looks and voice) where some of those famous quotes will bring a smile to everyone's face. Unfortunately it's not enough, and what could have been a classic, is turned average, not because little effort had been put into the movie, but simply because it's too difficult to re-create something that genuinely is such a classic.Rating: 3/5",Ali

There is no real sense of time in the film either, and we are left to guess just how much time has passed since the last scene that we saw.  Those who know the story of Ali might enjoy this film as a highlight reel of part of his life, but those who are unfamiliar with the subject matter will most likely be left confused.

224,JoeFreezy,Good Actors + Good Director = Really Bad Movie,3,3 January 2002,"First things first, there was no way this movie could've been good.  How could you make a movie about the life of arguably the greatest and most influential athlete of the 20th century, choosing to do only a certain 10-year period of it, and squeeze it comfortably in two hours?  Well, you can't.  (And it was closer to three hours.)  What this movie doesn't do is tell its audience what made Muhammad Ali great, or what made him influential.  It doesn't dig into his mind to try and explain his charisma or cockiness.  (If you want to know anything about Muhammad Ali, go watch one of those A&E documentaries.)  What we are left with is a few of his fights with some so-called plot sandwiched in between.But enough with the bashing.  Let's give some credit where credit is due.Acting.This was to be the movie that made Will Smith great.  He was supposed to win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Actor in a landslide.  And believe me, Will Smith did not disappoint.  Along with he 30-35 lbs of muscle he added on to look the part, he definitely talked the part as well, though the dullness of the movie will probably cost him his Oscar.  Jamie Foxx as Ali's sidekick and corner-man Drew `Bundini' Brown brought some much needed comic relief to the movie.  Foxx's oversized belly and thinning hair made his role that much more believable.  But arguably the best acting performance was done by Jon Voight portraying sports analyst Howard Cossell.  His makeup and voice brought audiences back to the days of ABC's Wide World of Sports with stunning accuracy.Direction and photography.Not often could a bad movie be the result of a director who did his job fairly well.  The movie lagged extremely.  But the fight scenes were probably one of the best caught on film.  What satisfied me the most was its realism.  (I guess this would be a spoiler if you've never seen an Ali fight.) The lasting images of Ali standing over Sonny Liston in Ali-Liston II, Frazier knocking down Ali in there first bout, and George Foreman twirling around the ring before collapsing flat on his back, out of breath were just the way I remembered them.  Too bad the fight scenes were the only things in the movie worth watching.If I were to cite the things in this movie that could've been improved, we may be here for a while.  So I'll just say that the Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, and Michael Mann couldn't save this movie from failing before it even started.  But they did do their best.My score for this movie - 3/10.",Ali
225,deadoralive,A Good Movie Except For One Problem,2,12 December 2001,"It is a good movie except for one problem. The movie Ali is a story that should have been told a long time ago. The production can not be criticised. Michael Mann direction is fabulous. Ali, the movie does suffer under the casting of Will Smith as Ali. Smith does not have the range or ability to portray this ""living legend"". In many scenes he look nervous and completely out of place. I am afraid that many people will like Smith as Ali because he is playing Ali. The other cast member suit there roles much better than Smith who unfortunately is the downfall of the movie. Smith does play Ali well in the boxing scenes.",Ali
226,xTapoutx,Overrated? All signs point to yes,5,23 June 2006,"This film is a prime example of when Hollywood gets its hands on a biographical account of someone's life and continues to dramatize it to ludicrous proportions. Muhammad Ali: one of the greatest boxers of all time and he had an interesting life out of the ring too. However, this movie focuses more on overly dramatizing these outside-the-ring moments than it does capturing the essence of his greatness; which was winning fights. There is only brief mention of Ali's second fight with Frazier and nothing at all of their 3rd fight, ""The Thrilla in Manilla"" (arguably one of the greatest boxing matches of all time). Also, there is no mention of the 2nd fight between Foreman and Ali. Being a huge fan of historical boxing, this really bothers me. My next bone to pick with this film is the way all of Ali's opponents (with the exception of Frazier) were portrayed as unsavory individuals who only wanted to destroy people in the ring. In other words, Ali is made up to be a near flawless guy while everyone else is plagued with vice and a terrible disposition. One thing that really irked me about the two matches that were shown against Sonny Liston are as follows: 1) Fight #1- Sonny Liston forfeited the fight due to a dislocated shoulder. NOT because he couldn't take any more of Ali's punishment.2) Fight #2- There is no mention in the film that Liston threw the fight because of tie-ins with the St. Louis mob. Ali is portrayed as a really angry dude who annihilated Liston in response to the death of Malcolm X. My last gripe with the film is the RIDICULOUSLY long intro and other assorted parts throughout the film where Ali first meets and romances any of his various wives. This film could have easily been 1 hr. 45 min. instead of over two and half hours and could have included more factual elements in regard to the actual boxing aspect.On the bright side, the acting was superb (especially Jon Voight as Howard Cosell) so I'd give this movie a 5 out of 10; nowhere near perfect but it won't kill you either.",Ali
227,wildegray,"A good, but not totally satisfying film.",7,27 December 2001,"""Ali"" is a powerful docudrama, with some major flaws.  Though the performances are uniformly excellent (particularly Will Smith in the title role), the film does not have a third act.  It simply ends, not bothering to tie up the many plot strands it presents.  Additionally, there is a lot of material that feels impertinent to the film, not the least of which is the extra-marital affair Ali engages in during the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" sequence.  I actually feel that ""When We Were Kings,"" the documentary about Ali, was a more successful piece because it was limited to the coverage of the ""Rumble in the Jungle.""  ""Ali"" feels at times that its reach exceeds its grasp, and at others like it doesn't even try to reach very far. Frustrating, because there are so many good moments in the film and yet they fail to add up to anything remotely as powerful as the impact that Muhammad Ali has had and continues to have on our world.",Ali
228,stemmy,Not the greatest of all times!,5,13 March 2002,"This was an ordinary film about an extraordinary individual. It's a good effort, but falls short in virtually every area. Will Smith has a decent stab at Ali, getting the voice just about spot on. He's worked out but is still about 30 pounds shy. But you never BELIEVE this is Ali you're watching. It's always Will Smith and I found myself expecting Carlton Banks to run on and do a little dance.The fight sequences are beutifuly shot and almost faithfully recreated. But the film just seems to cover a decade without filling any gaps. Ali beats Liston, suddenly he's married with kids, refusing army induction, losing to Frazier, beating Foreman and hang on - it's ten years on and he looks no different. To anyone who doesn't know about Ali it's as if all this happened in six months!If you want to know about the real Ali - read the books, watch the real interviews, and watch the fights. Now, that's entertainment!",Ali
229,wise49,The Biggest Modern Day Character Challenge I can imagine...,10,18 February 2007,"Some people never liked Ali. He is one of those characters who is so strong, most people are forced to either love him despite his weaknesses or hate him. He was one figure in American history who never really needed anybody. He was a conscientious objector against the Viet Nam war, yet he is honored by presidents of the nation he refused to capitulate with in crimes against humanity. His story is that vital to America. When Ali was still a teenager, he tried his best to prove his personal excellence in a society prejudiced against black people. He won the boxing gold medal at the Rome Olympics in 1960, yet he came home to Louisville and still wasn't ""good enough"" buy a sandwich at a white restaurant, because he was black. He then decided if the gold medal wasn't good enough for America, then it wasn't good enough for him. At this point in his life, when he had nothing else; he took the gold medal and threw it in the river. He observed the wrestler, Gorgeous George, and admired the way he used the negative energy generated by those who disapproved of him as fuel to become the top attraction and make fools of all those who were against him. He wanted to make people boo him. He proclaimed himself as more beautiful than any creature on the planet. He told the world he was the greatest who ever lived. The more they booed him, the more energy it gave him. He didn't have a mentor or a manager. He assembled a group of Louisville investors to bankroll him, all by himself. He knew exactly what he wanted from the world, reached out and took it. He made a crown out of it. Nobody gave him anything, and nobody can ever take that away. He discarded the name of a great white civil rights leader during the civil war and reasoned that if he was really free to be what HE was, then he should take a name that he thought was a natural black person's name. It didn't make sense for others who came before him to fight and win the rights to do whatever they wanted, if they were then going to do nothing but turn around and say ""Thank You"". He decided in order to validate the fight for freedom, his role was to be free. Muhammad Ali is played by the maybe the only person in the universe who would dare to even attempt it and he succeeds marvelously; not just in a marginal way, but in a big, big way.This film isn't just swagger, or an imitation of Ali. This is a deep, sensitive, poignant, and romantic story about one of the greatest public figures of the twentieth century. This man truly is a poet and he's lived the life of a poet. To a great extent, Muhammad Ali made his life a manifesto of truth about the American experience. Of all the stories of the twentieth century in America, this was one of the most important ones to tell. This film has characters galore: from Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown, who keeps chanting ""float like a butterfly, sting like a beeee!"" when everyone in the world thought Ali was going to die at the hands of Sonny Liston; Jada PinkettSmith as Ali's devoutly religious and adoring first wife; MichaelMichele playing Veronica Porche, a beautiful jet set model with whomAli had an affair, to a strong performance by Mario Van Peebles as Ali's conscience; Malcolm X, who forces Ali to think against himself and his adoring Black Muslim following in the interests of right and wrong.This film has irony, choreography, conflict, humor, drama; and accurately portrays the highest highs of any public figure I've seen in my lifetime, as well as some of the most bitter defeats.This is about male psychology. This is about female psychology. This is about a religious movement in America. This is about a culture in America and many cultures in America and their struggles to live together and treat each other right and fairly, while trying to do the right thing as concerns their own conscience.The most glaring weaknesses of any sports film ever made are in the sport scenes themselves. This is the strongest point of this film and also makes it the greatest sports film ever made.I've been a boxing fan since I was eleven. I was a part of crowds who gathered around Muhammad Ali before he became champion. I know what he looks like face to face. I've watched his boxing films dozens of times, and I'll tell you that the scenes in this movie are perfect reenactments of what actually happened in the ring. This couldn't have been done in less than dozens of takes per scene. They throw punches exactly like the fighters in the real fights. They're in the same part of the ring when they throw those punches. They react to the punches the same way. They even get knocked down in the correct parts of the ring in exactly the same way as the fighters who were in the original fight.I'm not going to comment on whether it should have won an Oscar for best picture, best actor, best supporting actor, best direction, best photography, best choreography, or other features in the film. Maybe it's better that it didn't win those awards in that year because this film is bigger than any year.This is the sports film that all others will be judged by from here on out by anyone with any sense of realism and art in movies.This is one for the ages.",Ali
230,laidback_15_53,This movie met most of my expectations.,2,1 February 2006,"When I first heard that Will Smith, a mediocre actor at best, was chosen to portray Ali, my first thought was ""What are they going to have to do to his ears so Ali doesn't look like Dumbo?"". I could not imagine how Smith would ever be able to give a convincing performance as Ali. And, as far as I am concerned, he didn't. One of the first scenes of him walking down the corridor to the arena made me laugh as I saw a scrawny legged Will Smith trying to imitate Ali. While the movie only dealt with 10 years of Ali's career, I think the attempt to include as much detail as it could caused the movie to seem disjointed. Sometimes I felt that I was fortunate to have lived through all of those events because it helped me to keep the story line straight. It was a turbulent time and I think the ""spirit"" of the time was captured well in the movie. Not being a big fan of Mohammad Ali, I didn't see him as someone who did much to further the cause of the civil rights movement. (Unless of course it was to benefit him in some way) I think his egotistical, self-serving three ring circus behavior was an embarrassment to professional boxing. His manipulating the media spotlight by being in cahoots with Howard Cosell is another example of his being more of a showman than an athlete. One thing I did admire about Ali was his refusal to enter the U. S. military. The movie portrayed the consequences of such a decision in a realistic way. I feel the strongest aspect of the movie was how it showed Ali as a human. A real person faced with may of the same obstacles and frustrations that most of us experience. Sure most of us don't experience things on the same scale as he did but the basic predicaments are the same. Loneliness, uncertainty, joy, love, excitement, success and failure are things all of us can relate to. My expectations of this movie were pretty low to begin with and it pretty much lived up to those expectations.",Ali
231,Carole A,"Some interesting casting but didn't justice to ""The Greatest""",6,25 December 2001,"Will Smith was not up to it yet. Jon Voight was terrific as Cosell.

Don't get me wrong, there were some amazing parts of this movie. Will Smith does a fantastic job, some of the best acting of his career. The rest of the acting, directing and presentation were also good. But the story is horrendous.You find Ali as a person you don't really like but you don't hate him either. You pretty much just end up not respecting him but at the same time not caring. And if the movie leaves you not caring about the main character, it makes it tough to care about the movie.Also, while the movie is filled with potentially controversial and interesting issues that could be used to help make the movie less boring, none of these issues are brought up in detail.No one in the group of friends I saw it with thought the movie was worth the money and time we gave it. I'd encourage you to keep your $8 and 2 and half hours and use them for something more productive.",Ali
234,nitasell-1,Will Smith is brilliant,7,6 January 2002,"and while I walked away not knowing much more about Ali's inner thoughts, I was blown away by some of the performances.  Jon Voight, Will Smith, and Jamie Foxx simply became the characters they were portraying.  Academy Award nominations will come out of this flick.There were moments of Michael Mann's direction that were inspired, with many people talking and moving simultaneously; but he came up short when the movie was over.  As I walked back to my car, just felt an empty place in my heart for the soul of Ali.  What did he really think about boxing -- was it just a means to an end or was he 'called'?  What did he really think about being a family man.  The only hint was when he walked with Michael Michele.

237,tyrellcorp27,Who was Ali?,5,27 December 2001,"Who was Ali?  You would never know after watching this movie, for you will gain no insight of the man who is one of the greatest figures of the 20th century. Ali's life deserved an examination on film, such as Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"".  This movie is a big disappointment.  Especially since it was directed by one of my favorites, Michael Mann.Mr. Mann's direction and Mr. Smith's performance have one thing in common...they lack passion.  Will Smith goes through the movie doing a one-note impersonation of Ali.  His mannerisms and expressions are the same whether he finds out he's been banned from boxing; been banned from practicing his religion; or won his Supreme Court case. The only strain on Mr. Smith's acting skills were when he learns of the death of Malcolm X and when he stares at a mural on a wall in Africa.  Even in these scenes, it's as if Mr. Mann had to keep the camera on Mr. Smith long enough to get a tear rolling. Mr. Mann also gives no insight to the men around Ali, or his women.
Finally, the casting of Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X and Giancarlo Esposito as Ali's father were serious errors in judgement.  It's as if Mr. Mann handed Mr. Van Peebles a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and a goatee and said ""You are Malcolm X"". Mr. Esposito looks about a year or two older than Will Smith and he is supposed to be playing his father.  I'm sure with all the great black actors in Hollywood today, Mr. Mann could have done better in the casting department.This movie is even more of a disappointment when you realize that this is it:  There will probably never be another attempt to capture Ali's life on film.

I instead viewed a nearly unbearable piece of overhyped crap that was held together only by the fight scenes (which were, in all honesty, pretty cool). This disastrous film made it impossible for me to care at all about what happened to the main character, Muhammed Ali. If they had developed on one theme and perhaps exposed some respectable, likeable characteristics in the guy, instead of portraying him as this womanizing hypocritical boring ass, then perhaps it would have been possible to care about what happened to him. As it was, all I could care about was how much more time I had to sit through the painful dialogue and attempt at a plot.

I expected more of a boxing movie but it was more about religion and Alis life outside of boxing. Muhammad Ali was a Muslim and he worshiped Elijah Muhammad. Elijah Muhammad was the leader of nation of Islam, and Muhammad Ali wanted to spread hes message thru boxing. Muhammad Ali was a smart boxer, he made hes opponents angry before the match by teasing them and calling them names. This is a movie you probably have to see, probably one of my favorite movies.

The film covers arguably Ali's most eventful decade 1964-1974 ending with Ali's world title bout with George Foreman and beginning with first world title shot against Sonny Liston. Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx and Mario and Van Peebles are outstanding in their roles of Muhammad Ali, Howard Cossell, Bundini Brown and Malcolm X respectively. The score is also excellent, the direction is also telling, but the second major flaw is the editing, where they skip straight from Ali's first loss against Frazier in 1971 to the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 which as a result cuts out all of Ali's 'comeback period', and the film doesn't really then doesn't recover its boxing authenticity, also many people's criticism of the film is criticism of the man Ali himself not the film so that's disappointing. Apart from the editing and the marketing it was a perfect film about undoubtedly one of the finest athletes of the 20th Century. I highly recommend this film to those seeking a celebration of Ali's life but I won't to those seeking a better understanding.",Ali
247,Dani1972,brilliant,9,2 March 2003,"The movie is great. Will Smith transforms into something completely different of himself. From expressions to mannerisms, to even totally different rhytm of speech. It shows Smith has potential to be more than just Will Smith - the comedian/rapper. Michael Mann directs with exquiste style. As with Manhunter and Last of the Mohicans, Mann's use of mucic is simply superior to just about anyone else in Hollywood. Raising a song by Salif Keita, an African (from Mali to be specific) singer virtually unknown in anglo-society, to be the final theme of the movie is not only brave, but shows vision, for in the end, what else could it have been? ""Tomorrow"" has KO on ""Eye of the Tiger"" etc. Raging Bull is technically the better movie from cinematographical standpoint, but on some aspects (aural for example) Ali has even that masterpiece beat. At least the one great boxing movie has finally got some company.What I really don't get are some of you people commenting that movie of two and half hours is too long. What's wrong with you people?

Mann (who I'm a fan of) had no idea what he was doing, treating this film as if it were ""The Insider."" None of the relationships on screen displayed any chemistry. This was not a very tight film. Granted a biopic is supposed to show all important events in a person's life, but this was all over the place and lacked consistency. If you want to see a good biopic this year, go see ""A Beautiful Mind."" All though that film takes liberties, it is far superior to ""Ali."" The Rumble in the Jungle sequence is inferior to the masterful documentary ""When we were Kings."" Again, Mann fumbles around for 45 minutes in what is ultimately an exercise in futility. Here's what Ali, himself, is probably thinking while watching this film- 'Pay no mind, Mann's got this film in a bind.' 'If you want to see a good film with me in the ring, go rent When we were Kings.' 'A lot of people consider me a hero, but the number of Oscars ""Ali"" will win is zero.",Ali

Let it be known, Will Smith did a great job looking, talking and acting like Ali. However, the film could've been much better made. We went in to see a movie about Muhammed Ali, Cassius Clay, the Black Superman. What we saw for an hour seemed more like a biography of Sam Cooke and Malcolm X with a large emphasis on the Islamic faith. Nothing about Cassius Clay as a child (maybe to explain his reason for wanting to fight and change his name?). Nothing about his being an Olympic gold medalist. We did get to see a bit of training and a fight with Sonny Liston where it seemed there was some funny business (this unfortunately was never explained... it apparently just sort of happened and then faded away). The movie jumped from plot to plot, never really giving us any indication of where it was headed or why we were watching it. Therefore, we stopped. My advice, if you'd like to really learn about The Champ, would be to find a good book about Ali. Maybe someone could recommend one to the makers of this film.",Ali

Ali's struggle within the political arena of the Nation of Islam, his womanizing (the love scene with Jada was hot!) and the US's ongoing struggle with race issues were all addressed and created a mood that helped me to see how Cassius Clay became ""The Greatest.""There wasn't a bad performance given by anyone and if you can ""see"" Jon Voight in Howard Cosell, you're good - my companions had to read the credits to see who played ""the mouth"" of sports!Highly recommended - unless you don't like fighting scenes (there's close to 30 minutes of intense boxing scenes but hey, it's Muhammed Ali's story afterall).",Ali
254,baysidetidal,Deeply absorbing emotional trip 5/5 stars (Ali's jogging sequence in Afria will stab you in the heart with its emotionally wrenching revelation),10,27 December 2001,"There are many critics out there who have given this film negative reviews on the basis that the film didn't succeed in giving the viewers a focused look at how significant and grand Ali was.  I understand completely the motivations and arguments behind those negative reviews.  However, I must say they misunderstood what the movie was trying to do.  Because most thought Ali would be a standard bio-pic, the film was expected to cover a sprawling canvas of a larger-than-life figure of charisma known as Ali from childhood to present with deft focus on his life.  This was NOT director Michael Mann's goal.  Mann's ultimate objective, in my humble opinion, was to create an intimate portrait of a man whom the public saw only as a cultural icon.  To give him a soul behind that grand persona.  To reveal him as a fellow man among men; how he lived, how he behaved in his personal life, how he sat, how he looked, how he talked, every little insignificant moments of his life in the film were there to give the public an idea, a glimpse of him as a fellow human being and not as an icon or a symbol.  That is why the movie was an absolute masterpiece.  Although Will Smith's performance in the film was hypnotically amazing, I must say the real star of the movie for me was Michael Mann.  From the first 10 minutes or so of the montage sequence in the beginning of the movie, Mann absorbed me right in with his achingly beautiful, intimate, and minimalistic photography and compositions.  I still see the imagery in my head going on a loop and forcing me to play back the memorable images my eyes were exposed to as if they were photographic printing paper.  The movie was so beautiful and poignant, I found myself weeping during the many moments of introspective scenes with Ali looking on towards the horizon or vacantly into nothingness as if internally struggling to find his identity.  Before I stop myself in rambling on and on about how much I'm in love with this film and Michael Mann's directing style, I should note that there is a sequence in the movie where you won't resist in emotionally breaking down.  The sequence in question is the jogging sequence in Africa where Ali runs past non-chalantly through a village and looks at children's murals on concrete walls of himself.  I WILL NOT spoil this because I want you viewers to go through the same shock that I had.",Ali
255,micsobo,Better than most think,9,2 March 2002,"While Ali is not the greatest film to come out in 2001, it is one of the best.  The plot is very good, well thought out.  It is more a story of the times than of Ali himself it seems, for the first half at least. There are some parts where it moves a little slow, as it is a long movie, but it doesn't really detract from the overall product.  The cinematography is especially great, with the fight scenes the best of the best.  It's really too bad that more people didn't take the time to watch this movie, it is something special.",Ali
256,ryan_murphy-1,An incredible journey,10,21 July 2006,"I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie. It is a spectacularly directed, fabulously acted, and greatly-written masterpiece! Unlike other biopics with jump from childhood to adulthood, simply showing us more of a documentary-like look at the subjects life instead a single, consistent story, this film delivers an incredible real-life journey for the greatest boxer of all time, Muhammad Ali. The film covers a ten-year period, between 1964 and 1974. It begins with Ali winning his title from Sonny Liston, and shortly after converting to the Nation of Islam. The film shows how turbulent the times were in the 1960s. Black people everywhere were fighting for their rights, and in different ways. Martin Luthor King Jr. was a devout Christian who preached patience and peace, while Malcolm X represented the Nation of Islam, which was understandably outraged by the discrimination against them, and demanded fair treatment. Ali is obviously a Muslim, and a close friend of Malcolm X's. However, things start to dissolve for Ali after his conversion. The demands of the Nation of Islam and their radical leader Elijah Muhammad force Ali to challenge his friendships and marriage. But he stands by it, even to the point where he is stripped of his Heavyweight Title and threatened with Jail Time for standing up for his religious beliefs. But instead of backing him in this time of crisis, the Nation abandons him. However, Muhammad is fiercely loyal, never turning is back on the Nation, despite his frustrations. The Nation even goes so far as to suspend Muhammad from the practice of Islam. Muhammad stands up for two principals: He never stopped being a Muslim, and he never stopped being the champ. His two goals are to continue in his beliefs, and to win back his title, appealing to the Nation of Islam, and fighting everyone he has to to get to the World Champion. This all takes it's toll on Ali, from his first humiliating defeat in the ring, to even straining his marriage with his wife Belinda. Ali is not drawn as the upright and flawless hero. He is shown having an affair not behind his wife's back, but in front of news cameras. But however flawed the man may be, he sticks by his principals. His marriage going down the toilet, he demands, does not plead for, the approval of the Nation of Islam, and battles legendary fights with Joe Fazier and George Foreman. All of Ali's frustrations and troubles over the past ten years are brought to a boiling point by the film's climactic battle, which chronicles what is widely renowned as the greatest boxing match of all time.Overall, not only is this an incredible journey, but it is fascinating to watch a film directed by Michael Mann, to see the cinematography, film editing, and how it fits with the music. One thing is for sure:Ali is a winner, and still champion!",Ali
257,thezah,Ali: A Success,10,30 December 2001,"Ali succeeds at what it is trying to do. It shows Ali as a person, not a legend.I've noticed that a lot of people have been mentioning that this film is to slow and/or boring.  I bet you're the same kind of people that don't even understand 2001: A Space Odyssey. I have one recommendation for all of you; be patient and experience a movie: If it is slow, maybe it's supposed to be! Most of you don't even know how to determine what the intentions of a film are.On another note, I am very pleased that this movie doesn't shy away from what it means to be an American (through the Ali's words). It all boils down to freedom. So many people have forgotten the freedoms that they pretend to protect (i.e. the freedom of speech and the right not to support our government's actions). Look to the founding fathers, they knew what it was about.Also, Will Smith gave a fairly good performance... I even forgot that it was him by the end of the movie.",Ali

I couldn't stay focused on the movie as the story didn't seem to progress in any real captivating fashion. As someone said already...it felt more like a documentary, which is not what I was looking for. My girlfriend went to see it in theatres when it came out and actually walked out in favour of The Majestic.

There was a ton of ""filler"". A lot of very long boring scenes with nothing happening.Good musical!  Michael Mann always picks the perfect music for each scene in his movies.  That is the only good thing I can say about it.It was shallow.  I love boxing and have always admired Mohammed Ali.This movie had no story.  It moved at a snails pace.Don't even bother renting it when it comes out on video!  In an industry where script is king, the producers should know better than to make a movie like this one.",Ali

Endless deep and meaningless profile shots of Smith jogging, walking, watching backed by full on DRAMATIC music. Agitating rather than stimulating. Like ""Twister"" boring and irritating.

262,alabaster911,Michael Mann does it again...,7,6 January 2002,"Knowing that this was a film directed by Michael Mann, I had plans to see it, but I wasn't expecting to be impressed as much as with Mann's 3 previous films (Last of the Mohicans-1992, Heat-1995, and The Insider-1999) ALI completely blew me away.  The camera angles and cinematography used in many parts of this film were reminiscent of those used in The Insider, which added to the overall atmosphere of both movies. The reason why I was not thrilled with this movie at the beginning was because I am not the biggest Will Smith fan in the world.  But he did an excellent job portraying Muhammad Ali and will most likely receive a nomination for Best Actor at the Oscars.  Mario van Peebles also did an excellent job as Malcolm X, and his assassination scene is possibly the most intense part of the movie. If you go see this movie, I hope you will not be disappointed.  If you appreciate artistic vision and great character development, you will enjoy ALI. Michael Mann is by far my favorite director in the movie industry.  Last of the Mohicans is my favorite movie of all time, and The Insider makes it a close 2nd or 3rd.  Heat and now ALI are also near the top of my list of movies I will enjoy watching for many years to come.",Ali
263,titan_jeff,Fighting to stay awake,6,6 January 2002,"This movie was ridiculously drawn out.  Its as if in editing they put the movie on slow motion and then fell asleep.  Which is what I was doing during most of the movie.  I couldn't get past the fact that Ali was being played by none other than the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.  And they just had to throw in the real wife of ""Big Willie Style"" to help ruin what could have been a great documentary.  Though Jon Voight and Mario Van Peebles were good. The plot was not only slow, but choppy and poorly constructed.  And it was even tougher to follow with the lousy camera work.  I wish someone could have gotten the crew a steady cam because the ""intense"" scenes were ruined by shaky hands. The climax actually did excite me though, because I was ready for the film to be over.  And unlike the rest of the movie, it gave me what I wanted to see.  It ended abruptly and I can't say I wasn't relieved. What it left me was the feeling that all the movie had was a bunch of music on top of a poorly told story and pangs of disappointment in director Michael Mann.",Ali
264,qtrust,ALI- THUMBS UP,10,20 March 2002,"Why are the critics dragging this movie into the mud. I read somewhere that Michael Mann when making this film had the intention of introducing Ali to the younger generation. If that article was true then Mann's Ali was a success.I can understand that most of them critics are people who were around when Ali was in his prime, so nothing in the movie would be new to them. But I went to the cinema with some of my friends and they sat the whole 2hrs and were impressed. THEY REALLY ENJOYED A TRUE-LIFE STORY. And they were all talking saying they didn't know Ali had done most of the things they had seen in the movie. They were all talking about this movie for weeks on end.
As for the Americans, the fact that a black man stood up and refused to go to war in Vietnam is a very painful issue made even worse when he is a muslim(considering the Sept 11 issue).Please this movie is a classic with superb performances from the cast-Smith, Voight, Foxx, Silver Wright Van Peebles, e.t.c. beautiful cinematography, and one of the best action scenes including the climax of the film.This movie is a most see...",Ali
265,grimover,"An oscar-worthy, knock-out performance for Will Smith!",10,25 December 2001,"First off, I should say that as an amateur historian I'm always pleased to see a historical drama, and this film definitely has its history straight! Mohammed Ali is one of modern history's Great American Heroes, one who not only fought for his boxing title against some of the greatest contenders in history (Frasier and Foreman could have been undisputed champions at any other time in boxing history), but who had the courage to fight the United States Government for his rights!  Ali's life intersects with many important figures and events of the 20th century, and through this depiction of his life we get a slice of the African-American Experience of the 50s, 60s and 70s.But what makes this film special is Will Smith's performance, he carries this film capturing Ali's charisma, grace and sense of humor, and Smith obviously bulked up for the part (he's technically not big enough to play a heavyweight boxer, neither was Stallone in the Rocky film series, but like Stallone he overcomes that with the help of a little trick photography). Like Rocky, the boxing scenes are accurate and brutal (in fact, the Rocky films used the fights of Ali as source material for their choreography). Other notable performances were Mario Van Peebles as Malcom X (he wears that part with instant authority), Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee (low key but powerful), Jamie Foxx as Drew Brown (showing that comedians can go back to drama any time they want), and Jon Voight disappearing into the part of Howard Cosell.The pacing and cinematography of the film are also excellent, keeping it moving and interesting even at the low points in Ali's life when there wasn't much action, only despair.  Likewise the sound track is moving and distinctly African-American sounding.Over all, a knockout punch!  Now shake hands and go to your theaters!",Ali

Will Smith is only a believable ALI impersonator when he is speaking--email me if you honestly thought he reminded you of Muhammad when he didn't have dialogue as his crutch. 2. Never have I wanted to rescreen Spike Lee's MALCOLM X more than after ALI.",Ali

268,The Ashtrader,**/*****,3,15 February 2002,"A somewhat nice movie about a man fighting for his believes. Definitely not a boxing movie. If a boxing movie is what you expect, you won't like ""Ali"". If instead you expect the story of Ali... well you probably won't like it that much either! It's too long and too weak. The only bright spots are the scenes that show those events TV has shown again and again, like interviews, press conferences, boxing matches etc., and quite frankly they're not enough to base an entire movie on. Especially not one this long!What prevented me from falling a sleep was all the great acting, that actually does take place. Especially Will Smith does a GREAT job as Ali. He truly is more than just ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"". The acting earns this movie one star! Second star: Because it's nice to see Ali portrayed as more than just a boxer.Overall it's a bearable movie, that shouldn't be watched with too high expectations, but should be watched, though!",Ali
269,andertonjohn78,Surprisingly bad boxing movie,4,20 June 2008,"Michael Mann, after making movies such as Heat, Last of the Mohicans and Manhunter, presented himself as one of the best directors in Hollywood but I guess everybody makes mistakes. One of the mistakes is Ali. So whats wrong with this movie? Well first of all the lead actor, Will Smith. He is simply terrible and unconvincing in this role. The movie is slow paced and it seems it lasts forever, it is so boring that in the middle of the film you have no idea whats going on because your mind drifts away. Music is so so and camera work is not as half good as the one in Heat for example. If you haven't seen this film you haven't missed much.",Ali

I can't really comment on how the script relates to reality (not old enough really) but if nothing else the acting is all excellent - from what I've seen and heard Will Smith's portrayal of Ali is bang on - especially with regard to his interview style and his combination of arrogance and genius. Jon Voight too is excellent, particularly his interaction with Smith in the press conference scenes and Jamie Foxx also seems to do a decent job. 8/10",Ali

272,l_cercone,Will Smith shows his range; too bad script doesn't quite match up,6,19 July 2007,"Hey, it's not the greatest, but if you're an Ali fan or a Will Smith fan, which covers just about all righteous folk, you should catch it. Somewhat overlong due to two lengthy ""mood"" segments: the opening sequence, where we see various shots of Ali training for the 1st Sonny Liston fight cut with Sam Cooke singing in all-black night club and flashbacks of little Cassius Clay being exposed to racism at the back of the bus through newspaper accounts of the Emmett Till lynching. Okay, we get the background, does it have to go on so damn long? Just an excuse to pad the soundtrack. Likewise the training run through Manila  takes way too long to hammer on the obvious of how poor the country was under its rapacious government and how much Ali was admired by the people.If you're expecting heavy ring action, you'll be somewhat disappointed. Most of film is about Ali's relationship with the Nation of Islam, which is shown warts and all. Mario Van Peeples plays a rather anemic Malcolm X, whom Ali cuts off because of his increasing interest in violent action. Unfortunately, Ali comes off as something of a prig here. Then Ali's cold-blooded treatment of his first two wives isn't sugar-coated  he dumps the first (Jada Pinkett-Smith, who shines) because she isn't a good Muslim draped in veils, and boots the second, who IS a good Muslim, because he gets bored with her and can't keep his pants zipped. The film ends with the Rumble in the Jungle, and that feels a little flat. I was expecting more of a biopic, starting with the Olympics and maybe ending with his retirement. I'm so prosaic.Will Smith manages the difficult task of becoming Ali without descending into caricature. Damn, he even looks like him  it's the hair, plus the added bulk. But Jon Voight as Howard Cosell is superb. You won't recognize him, the make-up is so good. He presents a more thoughtful Howard than the ego-maniacal version played by John Turturro in the TV movie Monday NIGHT MAYHEM (which, I admit, was entertaining nonetheless). The physical casting is astonishingly good  the Joe Frazier and George Foreman actors are almost dead ringers. And there's a silent cameo for LeVar Burton playing M.L. King Jr.  and frighteningly like him. Overall, ALI is a more sober experience than you might think, given Ali's gift for quips and outrageous public behavior. There are a number of the hilarious exchanges between Ali and Cosell, and Ali being mouthy at weigh-ins, and they still get huge laughs after all these years. But Ali was down and out for a number of years, and we're not allowed to forget that.",Ali
273,nataly-calvo,Ali-is it about Ali?,8,22 August 2014,"In this film there is definitely an emphasis on the civil rights movements occurring in both the United States as well in the other countries he visits. In fact the movie doesn't focus on his boxing career, but rather the way he stood as a symbol of resistance to lack oppression. As a character he is actually portrayed as arrogant, irresponsible and rash. Furthermore throughout the movie there is not much character growth. And contrary to this depiction of Ali in his personal life and manner of speaking, the public has taken him in as a symbol of hope. When he refuses to join the army for ""people who wont even defend me here, in America,"" riots erupt. And when he visits Jamaica, it becomes apparent how his success in the boxing career has had an influence in the village population. They see him as someone who is standing up to their rights by consistently talking up his rights on national TV before and after his fights. In reality, other than talking up a big talk, he doesn't act in any way to bring rights to the general black people. In a way his actions can even be interpreted as counterproductive for the civil rights movement: his rude behavior in interviews and ruffling with the police and multiple marriages represents negative attributes that could be misconstrued to reflect the attributes of the African American population.",Ali
274,PlatonicMescalHead,"Mann's refreshing, smart and moving Biopic",9,9 April 2006,"09.04.06M. Mann is really the best contemporary filmmaker. He balances entertainment so seamlessly with meaning. Whenever I watch one of his films I am sent into a spiralling obsession with his work, I head for the DVD shelf and watch the whole of his repertoire for the next couple of days. He is a perfectionist with a purpose, he tells honest and human stories with a craft of the highest level. He works with actors in a way that makes them inseparable from his films. After watching ALI I had to look up a picture of the real man. W. Smith's performance was so good i had forgotten he wasn't Ali himself. I watched it with scepticism, haunted by the poor quality of Rocky and enchanted with the brilliance of Raging Bull. Now that I've seen it I would rank this film alongside the latter. The boxing sequences are perfect and blend well with the drama. The structure is not usual for a Biopic, there are no flashbacks and no voice-over, no childhood scenes and no deathbed scenes. This is not a life story. It is a story within the life of a fascinating and heroic man. Mann's career is one that makes sense, he is clearly not chancing upon 'interesting' projects, he is dealing with subject matter with a consistent yet growing sense of fascination. I can't wait for Miami Vice.",Ali
275,larrysyr-1,A disappointing movie,2,15 April 2006,"I looked forward to seeing this movie for a long time. Unfortunately, Will Smith does not capture the deep solidity Ali brings to life.Throughout the legal battle over the draft, Smith portrays a sullen person refusing, for no particular reason, to be inducted.My memory of this period in Ali's life is that he was open, honest and steadfast in his refusal to be drafted. The man never shrank (publicly) from the consequences of his decision, a decision based on principle, not on whim.In this film, Ali not only seems smaller than his public image, he seems smaller than life. If this is the ""real"" Muhammad Ali, how did he ever hold anyone's attention? As I remember the real person, he was loud, engaging, charismatic and exceptionally tough. Not a comic book superhero, simply an amazing man. In this movie, there is nothing amazing.",Ali

278,Da Tuna,"Like Ali, Smith warms to his identity as time progresses",7,19 December 2001,"Ali is an inconsistently paced movie, but Will Smith does a tremendous job of dramatizing the heyday of the greatest sporting figure (if not cultural figure) of the past 50 years.  The movie begins with an interminable montage shuffling between Cassius Clay jogging and an R&B lounge act in a nightclub. Really really long.  This is followed by some environment-creating fight hype leading up to Clay-Liston, Ali's first championship bout.  The fight takes up at least 10 minutes of screen time.  It's a well-done sequence, but a movie about Ali should focus more on his impact outside the ring than his exploits within it.  Once the movie learns this, it takes off.Smith seems to inhabit his character with much more confidence once Clay becomes Ali and begins his dealings with Malcolm X, the Nation of Islam, and the U.S. government in regards to his refusal to accept conscription during Vietnam.  Still though, the movie often seems uneven, with certain situations unnecessarily drawn out while other major events in Ali's life (receiving his Muslim name from Elijah Muhammad, the Supreme Court overturning his draft-dodging conviction, etc.) seem to happen in a flash, really happening to Ali rather than done by him.  Maybe this is intentional...Jon Voight is convincing as Howard Cosell.  He doesn't really look much like him, but he pulls off Cosell's trademark nasal drone to a T without falling into caricature.  And the antagonistic friendship they enjoyed with one another is borne out brilliantly--although at times I wonder if the movie doesn't overstate the actual strength of this relationship.  Don King is a ""gimme"" role for an actor, but Mykelti Williamson does it well, being sufficiently slippery, faux-folksy, and detestable.  Smith is excellent in the numerous press-conference scenes, although you get the feeling that he probably just studied tapes of Ali's real-life performances in these situations and aped them verbatim.  Even so, they seem fresh and convincing here.At first, I was disappointed that Mann chose to end this movie with Ali's triumph over Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle.  (In real life, Ali went on to lose the belt, regain it, and then lose it again all after this bout.) Today, Muhammad Ali may be popularly associated first and foremost with the health troubles that have plagued him as a result of having (sadly) extended his career into the 1980s.  Will Smith absolutely channeled the young/thirty-something Ali--Oscar talk is not unfounded--but I think he would have had trouble maintaining credibility as Muhammad entered his post-fighting years.Ali the movie ends with Ali the man at the peak of his powers.  The scenes leading up to the Zaire fight (which go into further detail on Ali's personal life, and also highlight the dramatic and sinister aspects of staging a sporting event in an African country filled with adoring, hero-starved fans but headed by Mobutu Sese Seko) are way too long, but they're also some of the most moving sports drama you'll find in a movie. You come to realize that an event like this could never have occurred without a galvanizing, universal persona like Ali to precipitate it, which is exactly the point I think Mann hoped to convey about most of the events of this man's historic life.",Ali
279,sadarrest,Brilliant Use of Music,10,28 December 2001,"Ali does have problems as a biopic, but it deserves a ten for its brilliant use and selection of music. The best parts of the film are montage sequences set to R&B and Soul. The only non-musical parts of the film that are really outstanding are the ""Whats my name"" fight and Ali's first exit from the hearing. Will Smith, Michael Mann, Jami Foxx etc. have done an excellent job.",Ali
280,coppermaven,"Ali, his life and the history of racism in America",8,2 January 2002,"I disagree with the previous comments.  Ali is a powerful biography that puts his life into an historical context.  Through the story of his life we learn about the history of racism in America; from the civil rights movement to Malcolm X and the growth of the Black Muslim Movement.  He is shown to be a quiet force in the evolving politics.Will Smith, even bulked up, is no heavyweight!  When they put him on the scale and said 218, we laughed; otherwise he did a very credible job.  I watched the film with several teenagers who knew little about Mohammed Ali and I was impressed how they ""got it"".  They were Will Smith fans going in and came out talking and asking questions about Ali and the sixties.",Ali
281,perdido_,Ali and the Music Mann,6,25 December 2001,"It's a shame. Will Smith finally gets a chance to show us his acting chops, rather impressively I might add, but his performance is diluted by a lackluster script and shoddy direction. Michael Mann has the ability and talent to create engrossing films. His last two directorial outings (""Heat"", ""The Insider"") are both perfect examples of how focused and intriguing his work can be. However, he completely missed the boat on this one. Perhaps ""Ali"" was too great of a task for him, or maybe the studio was leaning on him to hurry up and finish the picture. Who knows? But ""Ali"" plays like a film that was hastily put together. Any person who doesn't know Muhammad Ali will surely walk out of this picture still wondering who the man truly was. The fight scenes were decent enough, although I have yet to see fight scenes as beautifully brutal as that of ""Raging Bull"". The supporting characters were hit and miss. Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight were excellent choices as Drew 'Bundini' Brown and Howard Cosell. Mario Van Peebles and Albert Hall as Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad didn't seem quite right. The relationship between Ali and Malcolm X seemed disjointed. How did they meet? What truly drew Ali to the Nation of Islam? Why was so much attention given to Malcolm X away from Muhammad Ali? For a while I began to think that I was watching a watered down version of Spike Lee's excellent biopic.The most distracting part of this film is Mann's constant use of what seemed like musical interludes. We go from music to dialogue to music back to dialogue. I never felt like I could sit back and actually watch the characters interact because at any moment we would be drawn into another mini-music video. Ali was rhythmic enough with his moves inside the ring and his mouth outside of it. He didn't need the help of a sixties soundtrack. Music can often make or break a movie. The overall film suffers because time that should have been used to illuminate a man was instead used to bore the viewer with a variety of overlong musical vignettes.I give the movie a 6 out of 10. Hurray for Will Smith, Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight. Better luck next time for the Music Mann.",Ali

The story is told really beautifully and I think the film is a good lesson about the great man himself's life for anyone who doesn't already now about him, and also for people who know little about him. Also, characters such as Howard Cosell and others have been portrayed brilliantly, to very fine detail. I also think that Will Smith's Oscar worthy performance is alone worth watching this film over and over again. Also, if you are a boxing fan you will like the fights featured in this film as they have been made more realistically then other boxing films such as the great ""Rocky"" series.

And I was truly transported and excited from beginning to end.   I believe Will Smith's interpretation of Muhamad Ali was riveting and true to coverage I have seen over the years of the man he sought to portray.  I could quite easily see Ali over and over again.  I also believe Will Smith is ideally suited to portray the charismatic and serene Nelson Mandela. Although Mandela is larger than life, I am sorry to hear he considered the role too daunting.  Will Smith is very charismatic, and possesses an aura of serenity about him that makes him perfect for this role. If he was very good as Ali, he would excel as Mandela.",Ali
285,imp_tp,Excellent Adaptation of Ali's fights,10,26 December 2001,"The fights are not rocky-type or ""entertaining"" but REAL. Inside the boxing ring, things are different. I was glad to see close to perfect adaptation of Ali's fights (I watched documentary on Ali's career). Michael Mann gets credit for painting all the different aspects of Ali's life superbly. Well, 'Ali' is based on a real legend and not a super-hero and so it is hell of a job to portray such a personality on big screen and make it so entertaining to watch.The only downside of the movie was to focus a little longer on effect of Africa on him. But the ""Loud mouth"" CHAMPs witty and ""punchy"" remarks in his real life along, with his big blows inside the ring, will keep you glued for more.Overall, Will Smith's hard-work, Mann's adaptation and Mohammad Ali's legendary life makes 'Ali' a must watch for movie goers.",Ali
286,crit200,"good performances by Smith, and Voight",5,5 July 2002,"The best thing about the movie was the performance by Will Smith as Ali, and Jon Voight did a wonderful job of playing Howard Cosell. I thought the film tended to drag, especially in the first part, it focused too much on Malcolm X. The last half of the film seemed to flow better, and was much more entertaining.",Ali
287,catalinciubotariu-13184,no matter what Ali will remain a good movie,8,7 October 2021,"Ali is a good movie. Michael Mann is a great director. This movie is just a glimpse on Muhammad Ali's life. If you want more about Ali's life, read biographies and watch a documentary. A great job from most of the actors. Watch the movie, contemplate a bit and if you still think you can do it better than Michael Mann, go ahead, start directing.",Ali
288,gga01pmb,The Best Film Of 2002 ?,10,23 February 2002,"On a cold friday night in South Yorkshire, I went to see this film and boy was I impressed!!From Director Michael Mann (Manhunter, Last Of The Mohicans,Heat and The Insider) comes a superb biopic of the world's greatest ever boxer, and someone with more intelligence than anyone ever gave him credit for. Muhammad Ali is played by Will Smith (Men In Black, Independence Day, and Bad Boys) someone of whom I have never been a big fan of because of his insistence to crack incredibly poor jokes in his terrible movies. Smith has always been more of a comedian than a serious actor. For examples of this, see the godawful patriotic propaganda film - Independence Day.But in this film, Smith finally stands up to be counted. He gives a performance of rare passion and vigour coupled with an uncanny Ali style sense of humour (those with only a small bit of knowledge about the great man will know he was certainly no slouch in the comedy department!). There are many great moments from Will Smith in this film, his obvious pain from hearing of the death of dear friend Malcolm X (a superb if short performance from Mario Van Peebles), plus his inner struggle on whether or not to agree with his proposed conscription into the US army for the Vietnam war. The tension in this particular scene is incredible!!There are other great performances in this film, take for instance that of Jon Voight as sports journalist and friend of Ali - Howard Cosell, he is superb and his scenes with Smith are amazing!! Plus Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday) should not underestimated, as Drew Brown, he is both passionate and sincere.This film also ranks well in comparison with two other films about boxing - Raging Bull and The Hurricane , Robert De Niro and Denzel Washington's performances as Jake De La Motta and Ruben Carter respectively are both well known and acclaimed as Smith's should become to be.It should be added in closing that the direction and narrative construction of this film from Michael Mann is superb ranking along his greatest ever works, he and Will Smith should be commended for their efforts.In conclusion, this is a superb piece of filmaking from one of the world's greatest ever directors, that should never have got the bad reviews it did, which probably only came about because of the identity of the film's main star!!I have not yet seen A Beautiful Mind yet so do not know what to make of Crowe's performance but I have to say that Will Smith certainly deserves the best actor Oscar for his performance as Muhammad Ali, Respect is certainly due!!RATING = 9/10",Ali
289,Cranestyle44,"a film with Will Smith in the lead role as the former Heavyweight champ, Muhammad Ali",4,29 January 2002,Why would you make a movie about arguably the greatest boxer of all time and only include about ten minutes of on-screen boxing altogether? Who decided that the blood feud between Ali and Joe Frazier was not worthy of more that a fleeting glimpse of Frazier and his huge left hook that dropped Ali in the 11th of their first fight?,Ali
290,bertogordo,"Glamour, not history",1,25 December 2001,"Why should anyone expect different from an individual who misrepresents facts? Is it, 'I will pummel you' or 'He who reasons conquers his foes'? Basically, a winded ball of crap that could have been done better by A&E or The History Channel.",Ali
291,schrives,"When watching this film, remember that it is an autobiography",7,27 December 2001,"""Ali"" was long and a little slow, but just remember that it is an autobiography of Ali.  He went through some slow times in his life that we had to capture as an audience.  With this being said there is a downside that I did not like.  The movie was 2.5 hours long and they still managed to leave years of his life out that was important.  I hated when the words came up and said how Ali managed to loose his title and regain it again in the following 10 years.  Its like they left us hanging for a part 2.  I wanted to see why he retired and what about his family and what he did after boxing.  At least in words at the end if anything.  We all sat through the credits to see if they would show Ali, etc. but they didn't.",Ali
292,g_sully,Go ahead waste your time.,1,29 December 2001,"This movie oh what's the word I'm looking for, oh yeah...sucked. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Honestly I can't think of a worse movie. It contained all gimmicks that make movies terrible-music that takes the place of story continuation, love scenes that couldn't even tug at the heart of someone recently struck by Cupid's arrow, a story line that wants to be a plot when it grows up, worst of all it was about three hours long. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the acting, but you could assimilate the best actors in the world and cast them in a ""Barney the Dinosaur Movie,"" and what would you get? Well, my guess is it would receive more Oscar nominations than ""Ali."" Sorry Will-but I would rather watch every episode of ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire,"" than five minutes of Ali. Well maybe the credits.",Ali
293,daddys01angel,I am so proud of Will in this movie.,10,29 December 2001,Will Smith did so well in this movie.  The acting was perfect.  Jada as well looked and did really good in this movie.  Will should get an award for this movie.  I think this is ONE of Will Smith best performances.  The is a must see movie as well as getting the DVD for the favorite movie collection. Oh did I forget to mention how sexy he looked as well............. you just have to go see it for yourself!,Ali
294,AkChew12,"This movie moves so fast I get sick, bad movie",4,25 January 2002,"Oh, this movie is hideous. Okay, I'm 15 years old, and I personally don't know much about Muhammad Ali, other then he was a great boxer, he's a legend, etc.. Maybe that's why I didn't like this film, I'm not sure; but what I do know, is that for most of the film I wasn't sure in what direction it was going- in a bad way.The film seems to want to show me what Ali did in his life, his accomplishments, his falls, the interesting stories that surrounded him and the people around him, but unfortunately mostly all I get to see is WHO he did in his life, and THAT isn't even portrayed well. This film blasts through major events, important conversations, and pivotal moments so quickly I can barely understand what's going on. I understand it would have helped if I knew a bit about the man himself before I saw the movie, but the day I start studying to go see a movie isn't anytime soon.The whole movie I felt like I had missed something important, but I didn't, it just goes so fast it seems that way. If there is any savor in this entire film it's Will Smith's performance, which was in fact worth mentioning, I feel bad it couldn't have been used better.",Ali
295,gu-guofen,An exciting movie for boxing game and Michael Mann's fans,8,3 May 2007,"If you are the fans of Michael Mann and boxing, you are sure to enjoy the movie,especially the fighting scenes.Michael Mann has proved again that he is a master of photography.This movie makes me learn more about Ali.Will Smith does a very good job.You can see his determination every minute.I must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated, but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was 'a loud mouth', and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight, by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality, to be really coming 'the greatest'. It is a shame that Muhammad's life has been affected by the horrible 'Parkinson's disease'. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.",Ali
296,dondidio,2 1/2 hours of clips,2,5 January 2002,"This movie entailed 100+ snippets and clips supposedly to be tied together with the sound track.  When you yearned for more information you were given little,  when you wanted the clip to end, it roamed on forever.  There was no character development, no story line to follow.  When Malcolm X died I felt no emotion,  the same when Ali would toss aside one wife for another, I didn't care. The upside that prevented me from demanding my money back was that Will Smith was terrific and Jamie Foxx was surprisingly remarkable. Both would have done better to have performed their roles in a coherent movie about Ali.",Ali
297,vineware,All in all positive,7,8 January 2002,"Will Smith's performance was excellent and, although there was no character development other than Ali and to a lesser degree Bundini Brown, the movie was entertaining and worth seeing.  Will Smith's physical transformation and his capture of Ali's speech patterns was truly outstanding.",Ali
298,phoebe-2,this movie disappointed me,6,18 March 2002,"i was expecting to see a great movie ,but this movie is just completely different of what i thought it would be. It seems the movie is made with episodes ,but this episodes have nothing in common (the ones that saw the movie will understand).And besides that ,we don't learn much things about Ali's life . the only great thing is Will Smith. i give it a 6/10",Ali
299,carlosimdb,Sucks like there is not tomorrow,2,26 May 2002,This movie is totally boring.  The movie is so damn long and there is not real action in this movie.I was totally disappointed after I finished to watch this movie.  Just because I drank a cup of coffee I finish this horrible movie.,Ali

301,tom sjotun,Positive,7,29 March 2002,"The movie itself is slow, but it gets its 7 because of the good acting and the historical accuracy. Its not a boxing movie like Rocky or Raging Bull. Perfect for a sunday-movie.",Ali
302,george zip,Mixed Emotions,6,2 May 2002,"SPOILER--------------------------SPOILER-------------------------SPOILERIf your looking for a boxing movie you will be very disappointed.  However the first boxing scene was done as well as I have seen.  The way the sound is done really draws you in.Then the film slows down and is a little hard to follow because they skip around, leave things out.  It's a very important part of the story but it just doesn't flow very well.The acting was extraordinary Will Smith and John Voight especially, both playing larger than life characters and both really putting Oscar worthy performances. It was almost scary how real it was.The Directing was vintage Mann, and what I love most about his films are the locations everything is shot on location.  You just know there is passion in every shot.I can't say I didn't like the movie but I can't say I loved it either.  I just felt something was missing.  It's definitely worth viewing if you want to see great acting, wonderful direction and a look at what a major role Ali had during a very confusing time in our country.",Ali
303,DraxAnivar,Missed Opportunity,5,20 June 2016,"All the incredible acting was undone by sloppy-to-non-existent editing. I had to open the Wikipedia entry on Muhammad Ali to figure out who was who, where they were, and why people were saying what they were saying.Will Smith's and John Voight's excellent performances were wasted. The movie would have been greatly aided by displaying the names of towns and characters. It seemed like every time a new character was shown on screen, they were never introduced by exposition.The movie jumped around locations a lot, and the dialogue was confusing at times, unless you already knew the life story of Ali.Michael Mann can do better, but he seemed more interested in crafting the individual scenes instead of focusing on a coherent narrative. Thus, the movie was long, boring, and confusing.It was heartbreaking, I wanted to like this movie, but the editing ruined it.",Ali
304,lsalazar4,Don't you get it?,9,14 February 2004,"Many people don't seem to understand, but this movie is not about Ali's achievements as a pugilist, but rather him being thrust into the role of civil rights activist. He was friends with Malcolm X, who's popularity soared at the time...Martin Luther King was also near his peak as an activist. These 3 individuals had an enormous influence on the Afro-American civil rights movement at the time, and the post-segregation, white dominated government were very afraid of what would happen if these 3 personalities would have exercised their influence one way or another to oppressive actions of the times. The scene with Ali in Africa demonstrated to him that he was not just a boxer, he was hope to those that had none.",Ali
305,chapman1-324-50633,The Legend of Ali is Dazzling!,9,24 March 2012,"""Ali"" is not presented in a typical American Hollywood style. It doesn't attempt to establish a very smooth narrative transition between events. The movie is merely an artistic yet honest look into the bits and pieces of the life of Ali, and I think it is fantastic.The directing is top-notch and I think the music selection is excellent. Some scenes in the movie seem really poetic and artistic in their presentation, particularly the scenes in which Drew Brown took center stage. The boxing scenes are stunning - I feel as though I can safely say that they are the most magnificent and vivid movie boxing scenes captured on film. I think Will Smith's performance is superb.I think this movie is a grand achievement but unfortunately was overlooked due to the popularity of other movies such as Lord of the Rings, which at the time was utterly dominant.Just like Muhammed Ali.",Ali

307,thomashou,Boring.... no direction... Indecisive...,4,16 May 2005,"The potential for the movie was obvious from the beginning. A great story about an important person for his time....and for the sport...and for the political stands...and for the religion...and so on. But the movie does not succeed the capture of the mood, the person(s), the time, the sport, the fights, the excitement... and does not live up to the promise of being an exciting, explosive action/drama... Will Smith's performance was average and not Convincing. The length of the movie could have been cut to a third without jeopardizing the essence of the story. Much too long and non-productive scenes which tries to capture the historical and cultural aspects of the period... Sorry...no good.",Ali
308,bgermain,IMDb goofed,7,28 April 2006,"First off, IMDb goofed. In the ""goofs"" section of the films facts they claim that the fight in which George Foreman dethroned Joe Frazier was only shown to paying customers via closed circuit television thus making it impossible for Ali and his friends to be watching the fight in his hotel room. Well, as a boy of twelve I clearly remember the fight being broadcast live on ABC's"" Wide World of Sports"" and being amazed at the pummeling Frazier received. We did not have a closed circuit hook up in our house. Think I'm just filling in the blanks of a faulty childhood memory? Well check out the following link for proof...http://espn.go.com/abcsports/wwos/milestones/1970s.htmlAs far as the movie goes, I give it a solid ""B"". A bit preachy but not overly so. A bit revisionist concerning the relationship between Ali and Frazier. Prior to and right up to the Thrilla in Manila Ali never showed anything but contempt for Frazier. I still remember his vicious racist rantings comparing Joe Frazier to a gorilla and ironically implying that somehow Frazier was ""the white man's champion"". Excellent performance by Jon Voigt as expected. Will Smith's performance was acceptable. Unfortunately, whenever an actor puts on muscle, or adds pounds, or loses weight, etc. in order to bear a closer physical resemblance to the real-life subject of a bio-pic...most critics somehow interpret this as an acting tour de force.",Ali
309,ashpjohn,Don't rely on box office numbers,10,2 December 2013,"It's unfortunate Ali lost money at the box office and actually is on the list for flops/turkeys of 2012. I loved this film both for its content and delivery. I know about Muhammad Ali but not to the extent that most others do and this was the first film I saw that really depicted him in a way that should be seen for those who are not fans of his. This film was emotional and a sign of good acting and directing. This film should not be judged for how much money it produced because it has so much more to offer as a story than just a film filled with special effects, this is more of raw truth and character.",Ali
310,stephen-m-schneider,"I already saw ""When We Were Kings""...",6,20 September 2006,"Let me start off by saying Will Smith did a fantastic job of recreating Ali, and in general, it was a well acted, well shot film. But that's about all it was, this movie had the feel of a documentary, at times it seemed to be a clip by clip re-shoot of moments that were caught on film when they happened. I already saw ""When We Were Kings"", I certainly didn't need to see all of those same moments re-shot without any additional insight.In the life of such a public and publicized figure, the facts are fairly well known by much the audience, where this movie fails is in it almost complete lack of insight into the private thoughts and emotions of the principal players. Muhammad Ali was a man who was a constant performer and I know I was hoping to get real insight into what he felt during some of the trying times in his life.I guess I am penalizing this movie for my own expectations, but I hardly feel my expectations were unreasonable. In the end, it is a good movie for a younger generation who knows little about Muhammad Ali and wants to get a pretty good impression of who the man was. Of course, as good of a job as Smith does being Ali, there are countless hours of video where Ali is doing a better job of being Ali, and this movie just doesn't bring anything new to that table.",Ali
