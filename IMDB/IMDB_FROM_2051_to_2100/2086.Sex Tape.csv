0,SnoopyStyle,uneven lackluster comedy,5,26 December 2014,"Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) are college sweethearts who can't get enough of sex. After two kids and many years later, the sex seems to have dried up. Annie suggests a sex tape but tells Jay to erase it afterwards. The problem is that he doesn't erase the tape and he linked it to other iPads which he then gave away to friends and family. First they get the iPad back from their couple friends Robby (Rob Corddry) and Tess (Ellie Kemper). Then they try to get the iPad from Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe) which could derail Annie's deal to sell her blog.It's a reasonable premise for a sex comedy. Diaz and Segal don't seem to be the sexless middle age couple type. It's great to have Cameron Diaz in the movie but she's made a career of being an outgoing sexpot. I do like Corddry and Kemper as their couple friends. They get a few laughs in. Obviously Rob Lowe is trying to be the ridiculous standout of the movie. He's not working for me in this movie. Then the movie gets to the annoying kid and everything falls flat. After that, nothing works and the one joke gets tiresome.",Sex Tape
1,claudio_carvalho,"Promising Storyline, Disappointing Movie",4,9 December 2014,"Jay (Jason Segel) and his girlfriend Annie (Cameron Diaz) love each other and have sex in the most unusual places. They get married and have two children, and soon their sex life is almost inexistent. One night, Annie leaves their children with her mother to have a night of sex with Jay, but they are tense and fail. Annie suggests Jay to make a home video to rekindle their sexual life and they have three hours of kinky sex. Annie asks Jay to delete the footage but he forgets and leaves it in a cloud. Soon they search the Ipods they have given to their friends to promote Jay's songs to delete the video. But Jay receives a phone call from someone that has had access to the video. Who might be the mysterious intruder?""Sex Tape"" is an unfunny and disappointing comedy with a promising storyline. Most of the situations and characters are silly or stupid. The cameo of Jack Black and many scenes of Cameron Diaz are the best in this forgettable movie. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Sex Tape: Perdido na Nuvem"" (""Sex Tape – Lost in the Cloud"")",Sex Tape
2,nogodnomasters,THE FULL LINCOLN,4,20 November 2018,"Jay (Jason Segal) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) have sex. They don't talk, have romance or foreplay that we know about. We really don't get to know the couple even after they have two kids and get bored with sex. They make a sex tape and accidentally download it to a bunch of I-Pads that he gave away to to a group of friends...must be nice.The rest of the film is their attempt to recover the I-Pads.The clever humor wasn't there. It was all situational nonsense that was made worse through the lack of decent dialogue. For instance they relate their super sex lives to sports players. He claims to be the ""Shaq"" of sex. Okay, first person that comes to my mind would be A-Rod. You have an overt sexual reference plus a personal Diaz connection. At this point she comes up with a clever line that integrates her relationship and the film. Instead the writers dropped the ball, as I felt they did the entire film.The film has got plenty of F-bombs and sex. The nudity consists of butts and side breasts. No real Diaz nudity...sorry about the spoiler.",Sex Tape
3,kosmasp,Record,6,2 February 2015,"Comedies can be a tough sell and with a title like this it might spoil a few online searches for some people. On a more serious note, the movie gets its power and drive through the main actors. We also have a few great supporting actors who really get into it (not in the tape that is, just to be clear).The main actors are likable enough to help overcome a couple of hurdles that lie in the way and may have brought other people down. This works though and has a decent enough script. Of course Apple and another ""internet site"" (no spoilers from me, but it's adult themed) might look like big winners in this, but why invent something when you can have the real deal?",Sex Tape
4,BA_Harrison,Neither sexy nor funny enough.,5,24 December 2014,"Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel play married couple Annie and Jay, who are dismayed to realise that leading a hectic family life has had a seriously negative impact on their physical relationship. When they find themselves with an evening free from the kids, the couple decide to try and revitalise their love-life by filming themselves performing EVERY position from 70s manual The Joy of Sex. The proverbial hits the fan, however, when the couple realise in horror that their current iPad has synced their home-made porn with all of the other tablets they have previously owned-tablets that they have given away as gifts to various friends and associates.For most of its running time, Sex Tape smacks of desperation, chucking in as much unsophisticated sexual humour as the R rating will allow, but rarely getting the expected laughs; when Jack Black and Rob Lowe provide a film's funniest moments, then Houston, we have a problem. Of course, for many men, the biggest lure will undoubtedly be the sight of Diaz in the altogether, and at 42, she still has a very commendable body; unfortunately, facially speaking, she has started to resemble Jack Nicholson in Batman, which is just a bit off-putting-although not nearly as off-putting as Segel's hairy ass, which gets far too much screen time for my liking. Let's just say that the sight of Diaz and Segel rutting really ain't all that sexy.The film also suffers from a typically maudlin Hollywood finale in which our adventurous couple's ordeal helps them to remember just why they fell in love in the first place. Gack!",Sex Tape
5,tavm,Sex Tape is pretty funny with the raunchy jokes and scenes if not consistently so,6,28 July 2014,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both thought this was funny in spots if not during the entire time and would probably have liked to have seen less of some of the nudity involving the main couple (specifically Jason Segel's parts). Segel and Cameron Diaz are funny when we see them constantly ""doin' it"" in the beginning scenes but then they get married and have kids so that puts the damper in their bedtime activities until Diaz gets a tempting legitimate job offer so they decide to celebrate by not only doin' it but also filming it for their private pleasure...only it doesn't stay such for long. I'll stop there and just say that I also liked Rob Lowe as Diaz' future boss and Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper as their neighbor friends and also Jack Black in a role I won't reveal here. In summary, Sex Tape was quite uneven but funny enough for me to say it's worth a look.",Sex Tape
6,sunwarrior13,No Wonder Cameron Diaz Won A Razzie,6,21 March 2015,"Sex Tape is about a couple Jay and Annie Hargrove,who will have sex at every chance that they can get since they started to have a relationship.After having two children and have less opportunities to make love,they decided to re-ignite their sex life.Amidst their difficulties especially Jay who is having difficulty to have an erection by making a sex tape.They try to do every sexual position known to man and have their video entitled,The Joys Of Sex.Later,they get to realize that their sex tape have been spread online after Jay made a computer error.The couple do some actions to prevent its further spread and remove its existence online.This film stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel together with Rob Corddry, Ellie Kemper, and Rob Lowe.Too bad that despite of the talented cast involved,the film was simply boring and corny.Despite having sex,crudeness,profanity and vulgarity involved in the humor of the film and comedic scenes,it fails to provide fun and manages to elicit only a few scenes of laughter.The plot definitely misfires as it tries to provide all the necessary sexual positions that Jay and Annie perform which I felt was far from being funny as well considering that Diaz and Segel are obviously uncomfortable doing their scenes which only made it less realistic and unintentionally unfunny and ineffective as comedic scenes.No wonder many considered it one of the worst films ever and Cameron Diaz winning a Razzie.",Sex Tape
7,Scarecrow-88,Sex Tape,2,23 August 2015,"Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal are wife and husband who decide to spice things up by making a sex recording on his old iPad. The recording gets into The Cloud and others watch it on the various older versions of iPads, and this initiates the married couple with two kids trying to secure all locations where it might exist as to erase them. That's the movie in a nutshell. And it is just awful. I mean, it isn't funny as much as tiresomely unfunny. And this cast goes for broke trying to make the material work. It just doesn't. Diaz looks fantastic and Segal is in the shape of his life when they must be naked or semi-naked. I credit Segal for getting naked a lot, but Diaz wasn't about to be as liberal with the body's freedom from clothes. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper are a couple that are good friends with Diaz and Segal, having watched the sex recording, quite complimentary of their bodies. Corddry and Kemper even shag in Diaz and Segal's vehicle while they are in Rob Lowe's house trying to find the iPad given to him by Segal. Rob Lowe plays one of those meek weirdoes in a sweater who talks real soft and seems quite timid and shy. You just know the guy is some sort of secretive creep, but he turns out to be just a very wealthy free-spirit with unusual paintings from Disney movies where his face is featured as the main characters involved! Diaz snorts some coke as Lowe shows her tattoos of Easy E, among others on his person. Graphic, sexual language is used throughout (considering the material, that shouldn't be of no surprise), but it rarely is ever anything better than forced and rather desperate for laughs. Diaz brings a hell of a lot of energy as does Segal but they just can't make gold out of straw this go-around. Diaz is quite sexy, also, in the film, but watching her mug with all she's got with dialogue that begs and pleads for your belly-giggles is often painful. The included visit to YouPorn, with Jack Black, trying to council them on why they made the sex recording in the first place, and the blackmail from Corddry's son for moneys so that Segal wouldn't have it posted on a porn site both want to amuse but I think instead only encourage groaning. This is absolutely skippable. Once we get clips of the sex recording (a tame, carefully edited bunch of clips that would probably have about 25 hits on YouPorn), it is so lame, you'd wonder why Corddry and Kemper got so worked up about it. The travails of Segal and Lowe's dog chasing him is probably the film's lowest point (using a book and treadmill to incapacitate the dog is meant to be amusing; epic fail). I just wish I could get that time back to spend it on something meaningful.",Sex Tape
8,utgard14,Excrement,3,17 October 2014,"Dumb, unfunny comedy with two leads that have little chemistry. Cameron Diaz certainly looks good but her comedic efforts in this can best be summed up as ""trying too hard."" Jason Segel is far worse. In addition to providing ZERO laughs throughout the film, he looks like an obese person who has had gastric bypass surgery. His skin hangs loosely and his wall-eyedness is even more exaggerated than usual. Think Al Roker meets Marty Feldman. Also, the movie is full of gross shots of his ass. I almost lost my lunch a couple of times. The humor in this is what you expect from a movie called Sex Tape. The excessive use of the F word to compensate for actually having funny material is pathetic. It's like it was written by a kid who has just discovered dirty words and is using them to get a reaction from grown-ups. The only moderately amusing part of the movie is Rob Lowe and that's not saying much. One other thing I want to mention is the obscene amount of product placement. Apple either partly financed this movie or got a hell of a lot of free advertising. It's garbage and you should avoid it unless you're really desperate to see a little bit of skin from Cameron Diaz. But be careful -- for every shot of her ass you get, you'll get two of Jason Segel's fudge sandwich.",Sex Tape
9,neil-476,Not so much funny as spookily prescient,7,14 September 2014,"Annie and Jay, at it like bunnies when they first met, discover that kids, work, and real life reduce both the opportunity and impetus for spontaneous sexual activity, so they hit on the idea of making their own sex recording. Unfortunately, this also ends up on the ipads of various others, leading to frenetic attempts to rectify the situation.This rather silly sex farce was considered to be stupid and far-fetched until something very similar happened with images hacked from stars' phones, leading to Hollywood poking fun at and making money from something they were simultaneously getting hot under the collar about. Nevermind, the consequences in this film are still pretty silly.The good news is that Cameron Diaz looks good without her clothes and gamely demonstrates that she is up for anything.The bad news is that the rest of the cast have all delivered better performances elsewhere, the comedy isn't all that funny and worst of all, it has the typical Hollywood mealy-mouthed double standard towards sex: there is much explicit sex talk, full nudity from both Diaz and Jason Segel, but only from the rear - heaven forbid that we get a glimpse of a nipple!",Sex Tape
10,anaconda-40658,Let's Watch the Paris Hilton Sex Tape Sham Instead.,2,5 August 2015,"Sex Tape (2014): Dir: Jake Kasdan / Cast: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, Rob Lowe, Rod Corddry, Ellie Kemper: Pitiful showcase about marriage longevity and privacy. It stars Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as a married couple with two children and their sex life has succumbed to the daily routines. Out of desperation they decide to make a sex tape, which leaks out onto the Internet. This concept had potential but it is rushed too quickly with dialogue that totally caters to the plot as oppose to develop characters gradually. They search frantically throughout the city for I-Pads that Segel foolishly gave out that contained the leak. Director Jake Kasdan previously made an underrated masterpiece called Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story as well as direct Diaz and Segel in Bad Teacher. Here all three of them strike out. Kasdan presents what looks about as festive as the average sitcom budget. Every character acts like a complete moron. Diaz is beautiful but has showcase more sex appeal in other films. Here she does a line of coke in a scene that could have been settled other ways. Segel is completely over the top and is involved in a pathetic sequence where he is attacked by a dog that can unlock doors. Rob Lowe plays a colleague of Diaz's who showcases idiotic Disney film portraits that feature his face. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper play friends of the couple and they are every bit as stupid as the central characters. Even worse is that the film's villain is a blackmailing spoiled brat. The point seems to be spicing up intimacy within marriage but one thinks that Kasdan reading his grocery list on a web cam would be more entertaining than this stupid film. Score: 2 / 10",Sex Tape
11,mm-39,Shock humor,6,27 July 2014,"Sex Tape is a movie/comedy which meets expectations of what one would expect from the title! The story is about a couple who spices up their sex life by making a tape, which becomes lost\virtual via modern technology. What works: The story line about how everyone has a false front, but lives with a dirty secret side. Funny implausible situations that the characters must suffer through! The dog scene was tough to watch. Directed and acted at a pace which keeps the viewer's attention. All the actors can deliver perfectly timed comical expressions and lines. What did not work: The usual American Pie/Porky's type humor, which is predictable. Sex Tape is funny, but not memorably funny. I give Sex Tape a six out of ten stars.",Sex Tape

13,DKosty123,Without Merit,2,17 October 2015,"With Cameron Diaz on hand you expect this movie to heat up and show some funny stuff.Instead the movie becomes predictable and boringly flat. The realism of the plot is just too contrived. No matter how hard the cast works, nothing happens.what is really strange is there is little chemistry here and that is second worst thing.The worst is the contrived Hollywood ending. Enough said. post this in the cloud and lose it.After that realize that salami is just another lunch meat to eat only this film lacks the rye bread to really flavor it properly/",Sex Tape
14,sddavis63,When It's Funny It's very Funny. But ...,5,31 October 2014,"In one sense, this movie has to rank as a success. It made me laugh. Out loud. A lot of comedies - even well regarded ones - don't make me laugh out loud. This one did. But ... the problem with this movie is that all (and I mean literally ALL) the laughs are restricted to one series of scenes that are set in Hank's house. Those scenes are funny. But it's just one set of scenes. The rest of the movie is either crude or boring, and it features a truly obnoxious young teen character who becomes a blackmailer. The story such as it is revolves around Annie and Jay (Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel.) Dealing with some troubles in the bedroom, they decide to spice things up by making a hot video of themselves having sex for 3 hours!! Unfortunately, that obnoxious teen (played by an actor named Harrison Holder) gets hold of it and makes it public, and Jay himself accidentally distributes it to several of their friends and acquaintances. The movie follows their attempts to get the tape back.Cameron Diaz didn't work in this for me. Her performance was OK, but as an actress she just didn't work in this for me. I can't explain that any better. My gut reaction was just that this wasn't a character that was really made for her. The rest of the cast was OK - Rob Lowe playing Hank in that series of very funny scenes was great! Otherwise, I didn't really find anyone offering truly noteworthy performances.When it's funny - in the scenes in Hank's house - it is, indeed, very funny. Yeah, it made me laugh. Out loud. But only in those scenes. I give it a 5 only because those few funny scenes were so funny. Overall, though, it's a pretty weak movie.",Sex Tape
15,Hellmant,"The film could have been really funny, played out in a different and more believable way.",4,29 July 2014,"'SEX TAPE': Two Stars (Out of Five) Sex comedy flick about a couple who make a sex tape, one drunken night when their kids are away, and accidentally synch the video to a bunch of their friends' (and acquaintances') iPads. It stars Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as the couple and costars Rob Corddry, Ellie Kemper and Rob Lowe. The film was directed by Jake Kasdan (who also directed Diaz and Segel in the 2011 raunchy comedy flick 'BAD TEACHER') and it was written by Kate Angelo, Nicholas Stoller and Jason Segel (Segel and Stoller also teamed on writing movies like 2011's 'THE MUPPETS' and 2012's 'THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT'). Considering the talent involved, this film should have been a lot better.Annie (Diaz) and Jay (Segel) used to have an extremely healthy sex life, before they were married with two kids. Now they're too busy, with work and family time, and when they do have time they're too exhausted (and no longer have the interest). One night, while their kids are at Annie's parents' house, they decide to make a sex tape of themselves doing every position from the 70's sex manual 'The Joy of Sex'. Annie asks Jay to delete the video, before anyone can ever see it, but he doesn't and it accidentally gets synched to a bunch of his old iPads (that he gave away to their friends and acquaintances). The two spend the rest of the film trying to get the iPads back, before anyone sees the video.The film's premise has many flaws, of course, and leads to some extremely unbelievable situations. This makes a lot of the movie painful to watch and not very funny. There are a few humorous scenes and I really like Segel, Stoller and Corddry. I just expect so much more from them. Most of their comedy is a lot more hit than miss; this movie is definitely the opposite. The idea behind the film could have been really funny, played out in a different and more believable way though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/3AK4roDokJo",Sex Tape
16,Robert_duder,"Disgusting, rude, raunchy....but very, very funny.",8,6 August 2014,"If you read my reviews you will know I am customarily NOT a comedy guy. I have my favourites and I have a very specific criteria when truly loving a comedy and normally raunchy humour doesn't cut it for me. But because audiences seem to not like Sex Tape, I thought I might...and I did...a lot. It is thoroughly enjoyable. It is (absolutely) a very adult comedy with nudity, raunchy scenes and the constant mention of porn. I don't mind Jason Segel and usually I don't care much for Cameron Diaz but this was the best thing I've seen her in since There's Something About Mary or The Sweetest Thing and the two of them together were terrific if not incredibly awkward but it worked so well for this particular scene and their characters. It tries very hard and at least almost succeeds at being the epic sort of zany, crazy, sex adventure comedies that the 80's were famous for (Porky's, Animal House, Hard Bodies etc) Best of all, the film manages to be outrageously raunchy without being outrageously stupid. I think the film didn't do well because audiences now have to have ridiculous bodily functions and humour so low on the intellectual scale that you could watch it in a coma and still laugh. Sex Tape actually required you to watch. I'm not saying it is ferociously intelligent but compared to other comedies in its genre...it was.Jason Segel is one of the few ""new world"" comedians that I have always at least enjoyed. He stands out from the Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughan, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen crowd because he just seems to have better and more intelligent comedic timing. He makes that awkward, bumbling, every day joe thing work and work well. In Sex Tape he is nearly perfect. He's a dad, a husband, a middle aged guy still trying to find enjoyment in life. He feels real and you relate to him. His physical comedy antics are perfect and there is something about him that just makes you understand his plight in every movie, let alone this one. Sex Tape's best scene hands down (and perhaps one of the best comedy scenes I've seen in years) is Segel's desperate attempt to find an iPad in his wife's boss' house while being attacked by a German Shepherd. I laughed a lot. Cameron Diaz also fits quite nicely into this film. Her and Segel seem like a weird fit but they have good chemistry. Diaz is very tolerable in this (a big deal for me to say!) and she has some really funny scenes as well. This performance and film was miles better than the almost unfunny The Other Woman. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper are pretty as their best friends. The biggest problem with their performance is that they are underused in the movie but they still get some good lines and scenes. Rob Lowe is an absolute scene stealer as Diaz's boss. He is bizarre, awkward and robotic and absolutely hilarious in the role. He adds a great deal to that amazing scene in his home mid-movie. With a build up towards a climactic ending in a porn warehouse...I knew there was bound to be a big cameo and there is. Jack Black plays a very good (but very brief) role. Where has this guy been? I miss his zany comedy.Director Jake Kasdan comes from a lot of Television but he is gradually honing his skills as a film director. I thought Bad Teacher was an awful AWFUL movie but this was much better and he made it into a fun and madcap adventure for adults. Kasdan does seem to know one thing very well and that is the characters make your comedy. Everyone in Sex Tape has a very distinct and outrageous personality that makes you laugh. This is the first film in awhile that I remember actually and genuinely laughing throughout beginning to end. Is it brilliant? No of course not. But I don't understand why it didn't do far better than it did because it is very entertaining, incredibly fun and I hope that in ten years it will gain traction as a cult comedy. If you're looking for something a little bit naughty that will certainly make you laugh...this is it. 8/10",Sex Tape
17,bowmanblue,Not (quite) as bad as it's made out to be,7,25 January 2015,"Okay, in case you haven't already heard, 'Sex Tape' has been pretty much slated everywhere. Currently it's up for goodness knows how many 'Razzie' awards for how bad it is. And, if you check out the online reviews, you'll see that most people pretty much agreed with its nominations.So, I sat down to watch it, confident in the knowledge that I'd probably be turning it off at about the half hour mark. I actually sat through it all the way.Yes, it's not that good. If you're looking for a laugh-a-minute comedy then you won't find it here. Also, if you're looking for some sort of touching, heart-felt comedy, you won't find that here, either. However, if you're generally okay with comedy which is totally based around sex and don't have your expectations too high, then it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be.I read that much of the hate towards this film centres around the on-screen chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel. I can see where this is coming from. Most of the time the pair of them play off each other pretty well, but there were certainly a few scenes where their relationship felt very awkward, forced and even scripted. Diaz handles it better than Segel and she's definitely doing her best to keep the film going.Before you watch this film, stop for a moment to ponder its title. Sex Tape. Does that really conjure up images of high-brow drama and sophistication? Hopefully not. It's pretty much telling you what to expect on the label. I think the trick to getting something out of this is to suitably lower your expectations and accept it for what it is – a pretty run-of-the-mill comedy which has its moments, but, ultimately, you probably won't remember for too long. Don't hate it based on what you've heard, just make sure you're in the mood for what it is before you contemplate sitting down for an hour and a half to watch it.",Sex Tape
18,g-bodyl,Not the Greatest Comedy....,6,14 July 2015,"Sex Tape, it seems was only made just to exploit sex and to see how many cuss words are sputtered in a minute. Now mind you, I love films with lots of cursing, but those films have a point. There is no overall point to be found in this film other than what I mentioned above and product placement. It seems like Apple got a big paycheck from marketing their products in this film. The film is not a complete bomb, as I liked the performances and the ending scene was actually incredibly hilarious. Jake Kasdan's film is about a married couple named Jay and Annie who decide to make a sex tape. After they completed it, Annie asks Jay to delete it. Instead, he accidentally synchronizes it in the Cloud, thus making it public. Now Jay and Annie must find out who have seen the tape before their reputations are ruined. One of the things I found okay about the movie were the performances. Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz are really funny people, and they have some moments to shine in the film. I'm not sure if I liked Rob Lowe's performance as Annie's boss. His performance seems a bit off. Overall, Sex Tape manages to be a forgettable comedy and I can see why critics dismissed the film. There are some good moments, but they are far apart. The story has an interesting premise, but the film could have been better if it wasn't an excuse for marketing purposes and lame, unfunny jokes. But everyone has a clunker, and this is Kasdan's clunker. My Grade: D",Sex Tape

Sex in those days was terrific and happened VERY frequently. After the wedding, however, the birth of two darling children, Jay's hectic career as a music executive and Annie's successful blog, their intimate relationship has suffered. Neither wants this but can't seem to rekindle the magic, even when the children are at the babysitters. Thus, after reflection, Annie comes up with an idea. Why don't they make a private, for-our-eyes-only sex tape, following the Joy of Sex, and see if the later viewing will rev things up. It works. A night of ecstacy leaves them both estatic. Jay, of course, promises Annie with fingers crossed that he will destroy the tape pronto. Only, he doesn't. Instead, he accidentally sends it to most of their acquaintances. What are they going to do? Annie is in the running for a great job blogging professionally for a children's toy company run by Hank (Rob Lowe). What is this guy finds out about this? How can they stop their friends from viewing it and sending it on? Its going to be difficult as Annie and Jay race around, trying various ploys to get the tape destroyed! This okay film has a title I don't truly like but very likable stars. In truth, Diaz and Segal take the movie far beyond its script, as they are comic experts. Lowe, also, is extremely funny in a role that calls him to sport a prissy image that may hide some secrets. Rob Cordry, Jack Black, and the other supporting cast members are fine, too. Also, settings, costumes, and photography are beautiful. One must call out the lame script and haphazard direction for making the film an average, forgettable experience.

21,cosmo_tiger,Very funny and I laughed all the way through. One of the funniest movies in a while. Segel and Diaz have great chemistry.,8,19 October 2014,"""It's...well...you know the cloud?"" Jay (Segel) and Annie (Diaz) have been married for awhile now and their sex life has hit a rut. They are finding it harder and harder to make time and if they do it's not like it was before.

Jay, however forgets to erase the video and the cloud takes it and uploads it to all of iPads Jay has given as gifts. The set off on a wild night of trying to get to them all back. Comedies are a tough genre to market. The trailers either give too much away and the movie isn't as funny (like Neighbors) or they put a ton of stuff in the trailer that isn't in the movie at all. This one was a third type. A movie that can't put most of the funny stuff in a trailer due to the content. That said this movie is not just sex all the way through. The movie deals more with a married couple trying something out and the problems that happen. I really think movies like this are funny. People trying to fix something and everything being much much harder then it has to be. The two Segel and Diaz have great chemistry and watching them interact is hilarious. This is a movie that is along the same type of comedy as We're The Millers so if you liked that you will like this. Overall, very very funny and I laughed all the way through.

The rest of the film is full of dead spots, bad timing jokes, and awful safe humor. It wasn't really raunchy as it seems. Directed by Jake Kasdan, and written by Segel and Kate Angelo, the story tells the story of Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) whom sex drive has kinda died since marriage. Annie's suggest that they should film themselves performing every move from the sex manual novel, 'The Joy of Sex' by Alex Comfort on camera, to breath live in their sex-life. While it revives their libidos, Jay forgot to delete the video, and with file sharing app, it cause the tape to be synced to every refurbished Apple iPad that he gave to friends and acquaintances as a gift. Now the couple have to figure out a way to wrangle back each and every tablet, they gave, before they see it. I have to find this paranoia reply by them come out of the blue, since Annie was very open to the public, about her current sex life with Jay. Even her boss knew how kinky she was, with her blogs. Her blogs don't sound wholesome at all! Then there is Jay who is very not tech savvy, despite that he receives hundreds of IPADS per his job as a radio DJ. You would think that he would know, how to delete it. They really did a lot of stupid things that was too dumb to laugh about. It made me more anger about their characters. Hilarity was supposed to ensues, with them trying to get the IPADS from all of the people but most of the time was spend, with Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe) house. It's go way too long and eat most of the screen-time. The Disney creepy paintings and out of place cocaine scene were really not that funny. The whole idea of Hank Rosenbaum's awkward personal seem forced and not well-written, with half the time, it felt like Annie might fall in love with this guy, or Hank would try to steal Annie away. It felt like, a secret-love triangle was written in an earlier draft, and then taken out. Pacing becomes an issue as a result, with the energy dipping substantially as a crop of useless subplots emerge to pad out a thin narrative. It was just awkward to watch. If anything, the whole dog chase was intense, but very uncomfortable to watch, due to number of animal abuse and human attacks. The other two big events felt such a let-down, as cameos like Jack Black as a porn producer/owner couldn't save this movie. Even supporting characters like Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper as their best friends, Robbie & Tess felt lost. WTF is with the auto erotica? Robby and Tess get so turned on that they start having sex in Jay and Annie's SUV, knowing that they're nearby. It makes no sense. Their child, Howard (Harrison Holzer) felt a little bit, too unrealistic as 15 year old antagonist to them. All of the acting is meh for me. The sex scenes were kinda hot, but much of it is played for laughs. I like Cameron Diaz on the rolling blades for sure. This is the first time that Cameron Diaz has officially performed nude scenes. Still, it's nothing new. For the women, Jason Segel sure has gotten skinny over the years since his last buff scene in 2012's Five-Year Engagement. He looks like he's dying with this diet, in my opinion. Still, he's pretty handsome for the most part, and less of a jerk than Cameron Diaz's character. The message of the film isn't that clear in what it supposed to tell. We get the central message within the first five minutes; marriage is tough and maintaining passion is even tougher, and it would be great if the issue was tackled with more of an edge with more on stake, here. The movie could had be funnier, if they're written as a high ranking public eye people. Maybe a politician, teacher or public entertainment star couple. It would add meat to the story. Language is pretty strong, but it didn't felt force. I can see these characters saying words like that in anger. One thing, I hate about this movie is how much the movie is a product placement. Just about everyone has an iPhone or a Mac laptop or some other Apple product in this film. iPads are a prominent part of the plot. One character even comments on how resilient the casing is and how it protects the device from breakage. It's selling the product, over the film. Then, the movie plot solved itself. Why didn't you just remote wipe the iPads? They put into the film, so people don't think if they put a video on IPAD, it would sync to everybody and they can't get it off, making people turn to Android instead. Even, sites like Youporn get a good wrap in this film, saying that you have a video that you don't want to show, you can call them to delete it. If you're a celebrity or the video gets very popular, it's pretty much impossible to scrub all traces of sex tape from the web. At less, porn companies do honor, deleting if it's 'Revenge porn'. Its when someone acts like a jerk and posts explicit videos or photos of their ex without their permission. Some sites even outlaw it. Surprising, the movie wasn't banned in many places. India did censorship the film. Overall: I kinda wish, I delete this Sex Tape after watching it, from my brain. It was mediocre, at best.",Sex Tape
24,The-Sarkologist,Just not funny,2,17 April 2019,"Honestly, I seriously cannot believe how bad this movie was. Like, before watching this film I thought that it was only fundamentalist Christians who were obsessed with sex, but it turns out that this is not necessarily the case. Like honestly, I don't know if I have ever seen a film, that isn't pornographic, that is so obessed with sex. Well, there was Zack and Miri, but that is actually a romantic comedy, and it is also Kevin Smith, so I guess that can be excused. This film, well, no, this film really, really, really doesn't fall into that category.So, you can probably guess that this film is about a couple who happen to be addicted to sex, well they were addicted to sex right up until they got married and had kids, and suddenly discovered that it just wasn't happening any more. Well, to get a bit of a sparkle back into the relationship, they decided to record themselves having sex, and unfortunately it gets uploaded to the internet.Well, not quite, because it is only shared around their immediate friends who happen to have an iPad that is connected with each other. The thing is that despite them being young, and hip (she is a blogger), they still don't know their way around the devices. Honestly, that is absolutely ridiculous. Sure, it would be understandable if they were, well, my age, but these people seemed like they were in their early thirties, and were certainly quite tech savy in other regards. As such, I am not convinced, based on what was indicated in other parts of the film, that they would not have been able to prevent this video from being shared with all of their friends.Honestly, this film basically descended pretty quickly into one of those really bad low brow comedies where the jokes, if that is what you consider them to be, basically centre around sex and people getting hurt, and the people getting hurt is usually the male protagonist, which is the case in this film. Oh, yeah, and there is one scene where he is rushed to hospital because he voluntarily falls off of a balcony. Seriously, with the state of heathcare in the United States, and the fact that they were struggling to come up with $15,000 dollars earlier in the film, would have they been able to afford that care. Yeah, and with the circumstances surrounding the accident, I'm not convinced that his health insurance, if he actually had any health insurance, would have been willing to cover it.Yeah, I know, it's only a movie, but honestly, it is a pretty bad movie at that.",Sex Tape

But this was awful, I actually only laughed twice in the , and full movie and not even a naked Cameron Diaz can make up for it.Plot In A Paragraph: When Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) first got together, they were having sex all the time - but ten years and two kids later, the flame of their love needs a spark. To kick things up a notch, they decide to make a video of themselves trying out every position in The Joy of Sex in one marathon three-hour session. It seems like a great idea - until they discover that their most private video is no longer private. With their reputations on the line, they know they're just one click away from being laid bare to the world... but as their race to reclaim their video leads to a night they'll never forget, they'll find that their video will expose even more than they bargained for.Rob Lowe (a celebrity in one of the first sex tape scandals back in the 80's) has a small role, and is as good as Rob Lowe always is, in fact he was probably (along with Diaz naked) the highlight of the movie.A generous 5/10",Sex Tape
26,Thanos_Alfie,Boring...,4,15 May 2021,"""Sex Tape"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a married couple filming their personal sex tape and losing it later on. They both have to do everything they can in order to retrieve it but on the way a lot unexpected incidents will occur and they have to deal with them too.Despite that I did not have high expectations from this movie I was bored somewhere in the middle. The plot of the movie was boring without any plot twists to make it interesting and it was also filled with some cliché that made it even more boring because you knew and you were just expecting to watch what will happen. The interpretation of Jason Segel who played as Jay, it was good but not good enough to save this movie. The direction which was made by Jake Kasdan, it was predictable and without any imagination of creating something new. To sum up, I have to say that ""Sex Tape"" is another comedy movie that does not have anything new to give therefore I do not recommend you to watch it.",Sex Tape
27,Floated2,Several Decent Moments,6,23 February 2015,"Sex Tape tells the story where Jay and Annie opted to make the video in the first place as part of a series of efforts to revive a sex life that's been flagging ever since they had kids, and the film's only entertaining moments are the ones that attempt to comedically and somewhat realistically explore the tension and friction that animates the big night. Annie dresses up in a Rollergirl outfit but falls off the bed when Jay can't get her skates off; a suggestion to make love on the kitchen floor sounds exciting in theory but is cold and awkward in practice; distractions and rusty moves lead to bumpy stops and starts, as body language signals the shifts from foreplay to waiting around and back again. Segel and Diaz get to move through different modes, and for the briefest of moments, it's like watching real people.",Sex Tape
28,leonblackwood,More silly than amusing! 2/10,2,18 January 2015,"Review: I really didn't find this movie that funny and the storyline was way over the top. When a couples sex tape goes viral after the guy syncs it to the cloud, he tries his utmost to get all of the copies back, with all mean necessary. Personally I found the movie to be more silly than funny and the kids seemed more mature than the parents. After watching the crazy sex scenes at the beginning, I lost complete interest in the film and the ridiculous extents that the couple go through to retrieve the tapes, became tedious after a while. The whole smashing of the severs with there young ones, scene was totally stupid and unrealistic and the Rob Lowe scenes didn't help. Basically, I totally didn't enjoy this movie and I found it a complete waste of time. Boring!Round-Up: There's obviously a audience for this type of movie because it quadrupled it's profit which is why we constantly get films in this genre. I personally am getting fed up with these silly Rom-Com's which are not funny and a waste of a big budget. Cameron Diaz has seemed to have gone downhill recently with movies like The Other Woman, The Counseller and Gambit but they always seem to make a profit which is what is why her career isn't in trouble. Jason Segel also seems to star in movies in this genre quite often and I'm yet to see him out of his comfort zone. With films like the Muppets, The Five-Year Engagement and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which he also wrote, he is becoming a bankable actor but not the most versatile. On the plus side, there chemistry in this movie was believable but that was about it. Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $126millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/comedies about a couple who make a personal sex tape which becomes viral after it gets uploading on the Apple cloud. 2/10",Sex Tape

Now it seems that she seems to going in a steadily decline with such films like Bad Teacher(2011), What To Expect When Your Expecting(2012), and now Sex Tape.A happily married couple(Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal) feel that there lives have reached a certain dullness, with there careers and kids, so in hopes to spice things up, they send there kids to there grandma, in hopes to have one great night of passion, they decide to make sex tape for fun. Realizing the next morning, someone has text them saying they loved there sex tape, and remembering they forgot to erase it, now it has become a race a goofy race to keep it from getting out there?there was a good comedy just wanting to come out, but it never does. This film instead portrays itself has the travesty that it is. I feel bad for Diaz and Segal for being in this mess. There talks on sex and having sex after a while becomes like a joke that keeps dragging itself until it stops being funny. I was sitting in the theater wondering was any of that supposed to be funny, I was left feeling confused. The antics they get themselves into I have seen in better films. Segal and Diaz do have chemistry, but it goes nowhere. Rob Lowe has a cameo, but that also goes nowhere. Now Rob Cordry is the only who gave me a few chuckles. What does that tell you when you can't get laughs with sex and drugs, hire better writers.",Sex Tape
30,stevendbeard,Raunchy Comedy About Marriage,7,18 July 2014,"I saw ""Sex Tape"", starring Cameron Diaz-Bad Teacher, Knight And Day; Jason Segel-How I Met Your Mother_t.v., Bad Teacher; Rob Corddry-Warm Bodies, Hot Tub Time Machine and Rob Lowe-Parks and Recreations_t.v., Brothers & Sisters_t.v.This is a raunchy comedy about marriage. Cameron and Jason are the married couple that were college sweethearts. Now, after two kids, the romance is gone. They have to make appointments to have sex, and even then, they don't always succeed. Cameron comes up with the idea of making a sex tape, using the book 'The Joy of Sex' as a guide. Jason is all for the idea-have you seen Cameron?-but forgets to erase the tape after it's over. Now, I'm not a computer expert so I don't know all the details but somehow the video goes to 'the Cloud' and goes to certain lap top computers that Jason had given to people as gifts. The rest of the movie is Jason and Cameron scrambling to get all the videos back, before anyone sees them. Rob C plays Jason's friend who helps in the hunt and Rob L plays Cameron's boss; both Robs have received the valuable lap tops. Rob L is very funny in his role as a squeaky clean boss that has a dark side-It's also kind of ironic that back in 1989, Rob L had a real life sex tape scandal. At the end of the movie, you get to see more of the sex tape that has only been hinted at earlier. There is a good cameo to look for; he runs a porno web site. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug content and sexual situations- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Sex Tape

When the footage mistakenly makes its way to the I-Cloud, it becomes visible to many. I was really in the clouds and wanted to shoot myself as I watched this unfunny, lifeless movie that did not erect me with cinematic pleasure in any way.

No real jokes, just painful situations.Its sickly message of trying to not lose the spark from your relationships and making sure you don't lose touch with your family in the war it takes to manage them is not appreciated.But you get a butt stand in for Diaz.

34,alindsay-al,A truly awful comedy,1,9 September 2015,"The premise of this movie could have been really good. However, this is probably the worst comedy I have ever seen in all seriousness. The premise is that in an attempt to rekindle their marriage a couple make a sex tape. When it accidentally gets sent to all their friends they've got to recover all the copies of the tapes. Now Jason seagal is the lead in this film and the best thing I can say is that he is the funniest in this film but he still is unfunny. I just found him to be a stupid character and I didn't laugh at all at his jokes. Cameron Diaz is a beautiful woman but she sucks in this film. I didn't care about her and I just found her to be the stupidest character ever in this film. She was just so unfunny in this film. The rest of the supporting cast is so unbelievable that it takes you out of the movie and there not funny either. The story felt way too long and unnecessary and actually like a commercial for I pads. The sex wasn't very interesting and the overall story of the film wasn't interesting. The biggest complaint I have with this film is the script because this film is just really not funny. The situations are all isolated and drawn out for too long that makes them really unfunny. The style sucked because this film was massively pg for a film called sex tape. The film hides allot of the sex and doesn't make you care about the situations these people are in. Overall there are really no positives to this film and it must be avoided.",Sex Tape

This is certainly a low point for those two, as well as for the others involved. The only plus is the cameo from Jack Black, which is mildly amusing.Safe to say, I would not recommend this.

It stars well known actors Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel. I really liked the casting decisions, Diaz and segal have great romantic chemistry and I liked seeing them work together to get back every last IPad from their family and friends before they open up the sex tape that's on them. The whole premise for the movie is of course an absolute nightmare for anyone, especially when they're a 40 year old married couple with children and images to keep up for their careers. The movie's script provided a lot of good funny lines of dialogue and comical moments that were uplifted by the cast's talent. I really don't understand the people that didn't enjoy this movie, I thought it was very funny, well acted, and well written. And when I say well acted and well written, I don't mean that it's gonna win any big fancy awards, but still, it does its job of entertaining the audience and making you laugh when you to. One might not think that a film like this would have any heartfelt scenes, but it actually does.

39,3xHCCH,The Trailer is Better Than the Whole Film!,3,14 August 2014,"When they were just dating, Jay and Annie had the best sex anywhere and anytime. Since they got married and had kids though, their sexual activity dipped to below zero. One frustrating night when their attempts for sex were going nowhere, Annie hits on the idea to take a video of themselves having sex to make things more exciting. Aroused by the camera, they had a three-hour sex marathon following all the positions prescribed in the book ""The Joy of Sex"".In the morning, Annie reminds Jay to delete the video. However, Jay inadvertently uploads the video onto the cloud and an app automatically shared it with people to whom they had given their old iPads to, including their kids, parents, friends, and even the mailman. Jay and Annie scramble to get all of these iPads back and off the internet.All of that I had written in the synopsis you can also get from watching the trailer. All the funny parts are already there in that short clip. When you watch the whole film, there was nothing else worth watching anymore. In fact, the trailer was even edited better than the film itself, making it more hilarious than the film itself. After the initial funny premise had already been laid down, the rest of the film was nothing more than prolonging the agony and beating an already dead horse. That whole sequence in the house of Rob Lowe's character (as the CEO of the company interested in buying Annie's mommy blog) was unbearably unfunny.Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz are funny actors, but these are already very familiar roles for them and they seem to just be sleepwalking through them. Segel, in particular seems to be stereotyped already in this type of role of a lovelorn loser.

I laughed a few times, although the plot started to loose steam when Annie and Jay spent a very long time at Annie's boss house. The story wraps up with a visit to YouPorn servers' warehouse and a school presentation - the very last gag. Besides being only moderately funny, the dialogue is crammed with more swearing than a Tarantino movie. I am not sure if American middle-aged couples talk to each other like that, but it did seem excessiveI used to like Cameron Diaz but lately she seems to have given up and playing only vulgar and/or predictable.

In rekindling their desires, they decide to do a variation and film themselves having sex using the now all so facilitating technology namely the iPad. After three hours of hot footage is done, Annie asks Jay to erase the video. Soon they discover that the video has already gone to the cloud because Jay give away iPads synced to his own and their video, in Jay's iPad, is synced too. Rooting who might be the video's uploader, they go to their friends Tess and Robby, and they accidentally leak the secret. On the other hand, Annie is on the verge of having her blog bought by a kids product firm lead by Hank. Fortunately Tess's sister is Hank's florist so Tess and Robby drive Annie and Jay to Hank's. Trying to keep discreet, Jay searches the house while Annie distracts Hank by chatting with him. After the fuss of Jay and Annie, Tess and Robby decide to be the reinforcement and come cleverly with the idea of asking for a donation of a used iPad, which Hank easily does. Having collected all the scattered iPads, it turns out that Howard, Tess and Robby's sleazy son, who uploaded the video, and he blackmails the couple for 25 grand. Deciding not to indulge Howard, the spouses, having their children in tow, then break and enter the physical address of the site that host the video, causing some damage. The alarm trips and they get busted, but fortunately the site manager agrees to take down the video. That solved, the family then speeds up to the school for the kids graduation. There, the Jany and Annie remember they haven't erase the video on their Mac, so Jay jumps from the balcony to prevent their son from playing one of the new videos in their Mac which could be the sex tape. AT night, Howard comes to their place bringing the last copy of the video in exchange for they letting their son Clive to hang out with him.Like my opening paragraph stated, I thought this movie would be a lame one. It kind did for the first thirty minutes or so, the duration it takes too overly build on the background story. The basic premise of filming one's elf and partner while having sex is one that's starting to become a trend as a movie theme. The story develops nicely as soon as the focus conflict is introduced. But as I said earlier, thirty minutes to build up the background story on a ninety minute long movie is not quite a good job.I liked the jokes. The practical jokes are okay but I like the small dialog line jokes even better. I personally like the 'aftermath' sequence, especially the conversation in the car where the spouses get technical and still able to keep it funny. The panic and rushed aura portrayed was good that it depicted that even the most experienced gadget and technology users will be likely to forget about some key features the tools in such a situation.Cameron Diaz acted out quite nicely, particularly on the scenes where she's more active, whether talking or moving here and there. Jason Segel also did quite a nice job here although I must say that he didn't quite get the acting required for his own screenplay. What's quite bothering me about this movie that somewhat concerns the body in some way is that looking at Diaz, I then remembered when she was still having a younger look like she was in The Mask (1994).My say for Sex Tape (2014) is a 6 out of 10 score. A recommendation to go and see is maybe not a good idea since there are a few other better movies by the time this is released.",Sex Tape
43,rgkarim,A Big X on the Sex,4,18 July 2014,"My second review diverges from the kid's table and heads down a more mature route. This review focuses on Jake Kasdan's latest work entitled Sex Tape. Already turned off by the title, yeah so was I, but still I went into this movie hoping it would be an improvement over his earlier film Bad Teacher. So was Kasdan able to redeem himself with his latest ensemble of comedic stars, two of who were the stars of his previous movies. Read on to find out. My review begins with the acting of Cameron Diaz a woman who seems to land herself in a wide variety of roles, many of which are comedy. Now in the past I've felt she has put too much emphasis in her comedy, trying too hard to be funny. Not the case for this movie though, while certainly not the best performance I've seen, Diaz does a nice job delivering her lines and acting stupid, as she and her husband try to correct their mistake. Yet when she is not partaking in mind-altering substances, she is able to play the role of a loving mother whose caring side seems natural and well fitting for the situation. As for Jason Segel, there hasn't been much change in his style. Throughout the movie I felt I was watching Marshall, over exaggerated lines and incredibly stupid looks filling his screen time as the adventure unfolded. While some of his stunts were funny, Segel didn't have enough diversity for me to give him any major props. As for other characters, well the supporting cast really didn't do much for me in this movie. Many of the background characters provided little laughs here and there, or even rarer a plot element, leaving the movie dependent on the two aforementioned actors. While their chemistry was very good, for I actually felt they were married, it wasn't enough to make up for the other things lacking in this movie. One such limitation was the incredibly stupid humor in this movie. Now before a mob builds up or you stop reading this review hear me out. Sex Tape's comedy is not original, and pushes stupidity to the limits. It's stale not only because we've seen the antics in other films, but because we've seen all the jokes on the trailers as well. That's right, no shocker, if you have seen the trailers you've seen a majority of the humor before the movie has even started. Lazy writing leads to very stale jokes, often drowned out by the lackadaisical use of the F bomb, and actually quite a few MF bombs as well. You might think that I'm a bit too strict when it comes to humor, but that's because I like stupidity mixed with cleverness and that is not the case for this movie. However, I do admit there were a few jokes and gimmicks in this movie that made me laugh, especially some rather weird and funny paintings of one of the support characters. Putting the stupid comedy aside, Sex Tape also falls into some graphic displays of sex. It seems that rated R keeps pushing the limits, on what is appropriate, though for me I was not entertained seeing two naked bodies writhing around. Yes, the camera shows a lot of scenes with some interesting techniques taking place between the two. Some of the shots are rather awkward, some are just gross, and yet they don't shy from showing the details, with surprisingly steady camera-work. Thus, please don't make the judgment call to bring younger kids to the movie, please hire a babysitter and spare the inappropriate situations. Luckily if you can make it through the awkward, graphic displays and stupidity you will find some decent morals written into the tale as well. You can probably guess they have to do with love and family, most likely making you want to gag, but having them taught to the family by a certain celebrity is quite funny to me, considering his previous works. And while I know you aren't really going for the story, there is a nice little twist to the film that you don't see coming. Sex tape is definitely the stupid tale you've come to expect from the trailers. However the graphic, awkward displays of sex, combined with the stale trailer scenes does not make it worth a trip to the theater. Sure Diaz still looks cute, even cuter with the makeup work and she does nice acting, but it isn't enough to save this movie. If you are dying for a comedy though, or a big fan of Bad Teacher, then take a trip to the theater and laugh your head off. My recommendation is again wait a couple of weeks for the next round of movies and do something else. My scores for Sex Tape are: Comedy: 4.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",Sex Tape
44,eric262003,Had Funny Moments Which Could've Been Much Deeper,6,30 July 2019,"Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz star in this 2014 romantic comedy ""Sex Tape"" which demonstrates that making a sex rape is a lot more fun than seeing yourself in the act. It may not be a deeply provocative movie but it's still a film that will likely quench your curiosity.Diaz plays Annie Hargrove who reminisces to the time when the last time her husband Jay (Segel) has seen her naked. The audience is treated to a fun-filled expose of all the times they've got sexually active from their first encounter till the time they got married and then things just stopped from there.Jotting down on her blog, she recounts the reason why their sex life started going down. From having kids to balance and both having jobs, that's good enough reasons why they're sex life is on hold. Under Annie's determination, she suggests that she and Jay should engage in making a sex tape as a way to rectify the energy that was once lost after they tied the knot. But things don't go as planned as Annie wants those videos deleted, but instead he accidentally sends the video off to several Ipads as he tries to hunt down for them and the comedy takes off from there.Rob Lowe and Rob Corddry are the real standouts here who have some of the more funnier moments in the film. Corddry is Jay's friend Robby who is curious to see the tape and while Lowe is wonderful as Annie's boss Hank who speaks in annoying techno babble like a Steve Jobs just to stay hip and to be conncted with the modern audience. And though he runs a wholesome toy company, his most are anything but.Segel share penmanship to the story along with two other colleagues which include Nicholas Stoller and was based on a story by Kate Angelo. This movie is greatly inspired by the myriad of the ever popular romantic comedies that boarder raunchiness. The opening scenes reminds a lot like ""Neighbors"" which at times feels recycled and unoriginal. I'm sure they have originality in their veins. It's reason for the ""R"" rating is the chronic use of swearing. Sure it's okay to keep the story going that a few vulgar words will slip out just to keep it casual. But when it becomes too frequent it just feels juvenile especially during the more serious moments in the movie.There are genuine funny moments like the moments that centre around the performances from Corddry and Lowe. And sure scenes from before can propel the laugh moments that were well executed. At the end of the movie, we're treated to see snippets of the sex tape and they were surely to get some belly laughs.While not entirely an abomination, ""Sex Tape"" can be seen as a guilty pleasure at best. It had potential to be more deep but felt more compelled to be overly juvenile and vulgar.",Sex Tape
45,Sandcooler,"Some laughs, but it's very hit-or-miss",6,27 August 2014,"Throughout the first act of this movie, I was seriously considering walking out and finding something better. The set-up is really quite long and unfunny. The two main characters are bored with their sex lives, how long do you need to get that point across? A lot of these scenes seemed very cuttable, even the part where they actually make the sex tape is a tad boring. Do we have to know she writes a successful blog? Do we have to know he works at a radio station? I'm not booing character development here, but it all seems so redundant and desperately uninteresting. Suddenly though, the movie does pick up the pace and it's mainly got its supporting cast to thank for it. Rob Lowe as a crazed cokehead (such a stretch), the strangely uncredited Jack Black endlessly listing porn site names and especially Rob Corddry as the in movies like this inevitable pervy friend, they all made me laugh quite a bit. It doesn't necessarily make the movie any good, but at least it slowly got more entertaining. ""Sex Tape"" is one of those movies that's just good enough to not ask your money back, it's up to you whether or not that's an endorsement.",Sex Tape
46,bkrauser-81-311064,Not Funny or Sexy,3,16 September 2014,"""Sex Tape"" breaks the cardinal rule of comedy: It's not funny. I realize humor is highly subjective but I watched it in a theater full of the prime demographic (underage teens who snuck in and the Happy Madison crowd) and a pin could be heard dropping due to the lack of laughter. What's more, Sex Tape couldn't even satisfy on a prurient level. That's right, a movie called ""Sex Tape"" didn't even titillate.The story begins with Annie (Cameron Diaz), mother of two, reminiscing over the glory days when her husband Jay (Jason Segel in his 5th role playing a character named Jay or Jason) and her used to go at it like rabbits. Cue the montage of ""comedic"" sex scenes which conveniently cover up the good bits. After the two realize things aren't how they used to be, they come up with the idea of making a three hour sex tape. Due to a synching mix-up, Jay accidentally delivers the sex tape to friends and family including Annie's possible business partner and their own children.Okay, let's say you buy into the unlikely scenario and let's say that two people who make their living on the computer (she's a blogger, he's a music exec) don't know how ""the Cloud"" works or know how to remotely remove the video; I doubt you'd swallow the frenzy of half-concocted ways they attempt to get the video back. Jay nearly get's mauled by a German Shepherd and Annie does cocaine when they simply could have said ""Hey I need my iPad back, there are a few things synched on it that I don't want you to see."" Simple, quick, to the point and doesn't have to involve breaking and entering. But hey, this is a comedythings don't have to make sense.And make sense they certainly don't. Absurd moments meant to be funny include Rob Lowe's straight businessman rocking out to Slayer with pictures of his face imprinted on Disney iconography hang in the background, Jack Black playing a porn proprietor taking two minutes to list off the competition and Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper having sex in a minivan; none of which is funny. I think I let out a brief, fleeting chuckle twice. I laughed more watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" than this movie. All I was thinking while watching it was how far the two leads have just fallen. It's surprising that a movie of such abominable quality can be penned by Segel and Nick Stoller, the duo responsible for The Muppets reboot.Ultimately ""Sex Tape"" follows ""No Strings Attached"" and ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" in the unnecessary trend of raunchy sex-related comedies that are light on both sex and comedy despite having some pretty impressive casts. I put money on the DVD release putting emphasis on the ""unrated"" version providing no extra skin but cheaper, dumber jokes that were taken out for good reason. If I were you I'd just save your money.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Sex Tape

48,Screen_Blitz,Terrible waste of time and talent,1,4 August 2015,"Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel play Annie and Jay, a married couple with two children, who's greatest joy in life is sex. When their relationship starts struggling, the couple attempts to heal their relationship by creating their own sex tape, where they film themselves having sex. This starts off as great idea until Jay accidentally leaks the video online. The couple then go on a wild adventure to retrieve all the iPads of the people the video made it to. The idea of this film may sound interesting. But the end, it ended being a complete mess with lame dialogue, terrible humor, and a poorly executed plot.Based on the title, it is easy to tell that the film is a raunchy R- rated sex comedy. Unfortunately, it fails to be truly funny or clever in any way. What we are treated with is a cheesy story of how Jay and Annie met and frequent sex scenes that take up the first half-hour. Then you get to the part of the couple making the sex tape, and the scene itself is completely unfunny and stale of any good taste of humor. From there on, the characters treat with corny dialogue and absurd sex jokes that always come off as dumb and obnoxious. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel don't even share a good comedic chemistry between each other.Then there is the plot which moves in nearly every direction that it shouldn't, with Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel constantly after their sex tape that they lost and trying to get back it before people they see it. In one scene, they break into a building in attempt to wipe out their sex tape from the server which I think is the most useless scene in the entire movie. This is definitely one of the worst comedies, or perhaps one of the films I have seen this decade so far. I am surprised this dodged a Razzie Award nomination.",Sex Tape
49,blott2319-1,Stupid and not funny,2,19 August 2020,"What can you say about a bad comedy other than it's not funny? Sex Tape is a movie entirely built on the premise of a couple that has decided to spice up their love life by recording themselves having sex, and then accidentally releasing that recording to others. For starters, the mental gymnastics they go through in order to explain how the video is spread is utterly moronic. It's clear the writers were trying to figure out a plot device that would allow the ""sex tape"" to be released wide enough to make the couple nervous but not so wide that they can do nothing to contain it. So their solution is to invent a main character who is rich enough to hand out iPads like they are candy, and yet dumb enough to think syncing up his media library to all these devices makes sense. From the beginning this makes Jason Segal both annoying and dumb which is not a good combination in a protagonist.I suppose the stupid premise could be saved if the madcap journey to recover all the iPads had been funny. Poor logic is forgivable in a good comedy, but Sex Tape is about as far from a good comedy as you can get. Their ""wacky"" journey amounts to only 3 stops, and the best attempt at a joke they can muster is having a guy who presents himself as warm and kind, listening to heavy metal and snorting cocaine (while Jason Segel fights with a dog.) This isn't even good enough to make me crack a smile. Most of the twists and turns in the film are predictable, and that also spoils any attempt at surprising you into a laugh. It's sad because I actually like both Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz, and they seem like a good pair to star in a film as a comedic duo. But with a script as uninspiring as what they were given in Sex Tape, no one will ever be clamoring for them to try again.",Sex Tape
50,Stephen_A_Abell,Bawdy Comedy - But needs more laughs,6,15 February 2017,"Married with children, booking slots so you can have personal time with your significant other, only for something to happen to ruin the mood. If this sounds like you then you will probably enjoy this bawdy comedy.Our ordinary couple Annie and Jay finally get some time to themselves, as Mrs C would say, ""...to get Frisky!"" Only trouble is they just can't perform as neither of their hearts are in it and they're not in the mood. Then they have the wonderful idea of making a ""Sex Tape"" using their iPad. With the thought of this little bit of kinkiness, the clothes come off and the evenings fun begins. For four hours straight they act out all the Joy of Sex positions.The next day, feeling less stressed and considerably happy Jay learns that the tape has been sent to all his business clientele, for whom he'd given iPods that were synced to his own. He'd even given the postman one for Christmas and it was his e-mail saying how much he'd enjoyed the video that drops the penny in Jay's skull.From here on in it's a race to delete all the movies before people can see them, especially Annie's new boss Hank, played by Rob Lowe.American comedy has a potential to be immature and puerile when it comes to sex, staying in the realms of ""toilet"" humour. However, this film is a couple of notches above that and, at times, is quite funny with an adult resolve. The cast do an excellent job, especially Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel in the lead roles. It's the story and direction which let the story down, though. There's not enough laughs in the main body of the film to really carry it and it could have done with some more twists and turns. Strange thing is, the funniest part of the film, which had me laughing my arse off, was at the end of the movie. It's the sex scene's from the ""Sex Tape"" Annie and Jay make. Why the director decided to put them at the end of the movie is a quandary as, had they been in the scene where they make the video, it would've added some much-needed laughter at the correct point in the film. This is a major fail in a comedy film. However, they didn't make the cutting room floor, and they really did make me howl, so I upped the score of the film.This is a fun film to watch with your loved one, especially if you're middle-aged and can relate to the situation.",Sex Tape

If you don't want to be embarrassed by the release of a bad movie don't make it as it will get out. Cameron Diaz is capable of better as she has proved it. Jason Segal does his best work with Muppets. Even Rob Lowe and Jack Black are given nothing to do.The movie is a long 94 minutes. It fails the number one requirement of a comedy. It just isn't funny. There are about three laughs in ninety plus minutes. There are some dog humor that doesn't feel fresh until the Siri joke. There a couple of anti-Semitic jokes that fall flat. If that isn't bad enough they try for an epilepsy joke.The dialogue is peppered with ""F"" bombs. There's a we've seen it before drug use scene that serves to cut to the familiar dog joke material.The trailers and the title give away the high concept idea. The script feels like it's been around since tapes were replaced by digital videos. Many set ups didn't deliver a punch line and when they do the timing is off. The Ipad product placement works best.Don't waist your time or money to see this on the big screen. It will have a good run on a platform coming to you soon until word of mouth gets out.",Sex Tape
53,rbrb,Shameful Attempt to Glamorise Drug Taking......,2,28 November 2015,"There are a few vaguely amusing scenes in this movies and the sex episodes are usually tasteful and inoffensive; but overall this picture looks like it was made up as it went along. Scripted it seems by someone whilst having a long lunch and written on the back of an envelope. And the actors equally look like they are winging it.Married couple with kids have foregone a sex life with each other to raise their children. To rekindle their love life, they make a private sex tape of themselves which inadvertently is copied onto given away ipads. The movie shows their efforts to recover the ipads and hence the sex tapes.All the characters in this movie come across as irritating and obnoxious especially the children. In fact the star of the film is an Alsatian dog.Disgusting that the movie makers try to glamorise the taking of cocaine as some how worthy of comedy. Along with the likes of spousal and child abuse there are certain subjects which ought to be off limits. For the awful attempt to portray drug taking as fun and nothing else I have deducted 3 points from my assessment and come to a vote of:2/10.",Sex Tape
54,Ruskington,Somebody please remote-wipe this film from existence,2,13 April 2020,"It's a shame that this film was so poorly executed as the premise was quite interesting. With a better cast and script, this could have actually been a decent comedy.Cameron Diaz, who was a reasonably equipped actor in the nineties, is now little more than a middle-aged woman trying desperately to retain her valley girl demeanour. And Jason Segel is not going to get his long-awaited Frat Pack induction with performances like this. The poor man's Vince Vaughn is as painful and one-dimensional as ever.The movie trundles along with the usual crass humour and sex talk, occasionally punctuated with banal conversations about love and marriage. When you have a cast as weak as this, it's probably best to just stick to pure slapstick. Nobody needs to hear these vacuous characters pontificating about what makes a strong relationship.The lowlight of the film is the pathetic cameo from Jack Black, who should probably break into Columbia Pictures studios and try to erase this movie from existence.Rob Lowe is probably the only person to come out of this fiasco with any credit. He gives a moderately amusing performance as the eccentric Hank Rosenbaum but most of his scenes are overshadowed by Diaz's highly forced attempts to portray the effects of cocaine.A tragic effort all round, give this one a wide berth.",Sex Tape
55,bob-the-movie-man,A poor vehicle to show off Diaz's (acting) talents,4,26 September 2014,"Cameron Diaz is someone that must be so, SO depressing for many middle-aged women. Bursting onto the screen like a shimmering vision of hotness in ""The Mask"" when only 21 she then appeared as a highly believable high-school student 4 years later in ""There's Something about Mary"". Now SIXTEEN years after that in ""Sex Tape"" the 42-year old Diaz again plays - in a flashback scene - her character Annie as a semi-naked college student - still with a gravity-defying body that seems to refuse to age. There IS something about Diaz! Sex Tape taps into the general truism that ""nobody understand The Cloud"" with a storyline that is, I believe, quite novel. Married couple Annie and Jay (Diaz and Jason Segel), generally battered by life and parenthood, try to revive their flagging sex-life by making a home-made porn movie on Jay's new iPad. This private adventure in movie-making is meant to be deleted immediately afterwards: easy come, easy trash. Unfortunately this is where the Cloud steps in, since the new iPad synchronises all new music and videos to storage in the Cloud using an app delightfully called 'Frankensynch'. However it then simultaneously also synchs the material down to all Jay's previously owned iPads. For reasons of utter geekdom, and showing far too much of the excess of American consumerism, Jay gets each and every new model of iPad that comes out which means there are a significant number of old models that have been gifted to friends, family and business associates of the couple.This modern and topical set-up leads to scenes of classic farce as Annie and Jay desperately try to retrieve all copies of the video before it can destroy their reputation and particularly the hopes of selling Annie's squeaky-clean 'motherhood' blog to the equally squeaky-clean 'Piper Brothers' corporation, headed by Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe).The film should be commended for the premise of its novel story by Kate Angelo. However, in terms of the screenplay and the execution by director Jake Kasdan (""Bad Teacher""), the movie is extremely lumpy and uneven.True that there are some laugh-out loud moments in the film. One in particular with an Alsatian and iPhone's 'Siri' - whilst strongly plagiarising similar scenes in ""Something about Mary"" and ""Father of the Bride"" - is still a crackingly funny sequence. However other parts of the film are weighed down with tediously lengthy dialogue between Annie and Jay about the meaning of love and sex in their relationship and these just seems to kill the momentum of both the film and the comedy. The scene outside Rosenbaum's house is a case in point. In addition, the character U-turn by Harrison Holzer's Howard and the whole scene at the internet IT shop - with Jack Black, the friendly face of porn - is lame and nonsensical.Diaz, having fully demonstrated her comedic talents throughout her career, is great in this film and Segel has his moments, although is perhaps a bit of an acquired taste. Rob Corddry (""Hot Tub Time Machine"") and Ellie Kemper (""The (US) Office"") are also very funny as the best friends brought into the secret and suitably spicing up their own sex life as a result.But once again (as in ""Behind the Candelabra"") it is Rob Lowe who steals the show as the outrageously ego-centric and manic Rosenbaum. The paintings around his house depicting himself inserted into classic Disney scenes are hilarious: I'd pay to see a sequel of ""Meet the Rosenbaums"".As you might guess from the title, the film is very rude with a good deal of nudity, sex and bad language. But more disturbing to me was the casual encouragement to partake in hard drugs (cocaine in this case), depicted as both 'cool' and something that the lead character Annie would ""like to try again"". I have never taken drugs, and never intend to, which probably puts me in a minority of the population these days! But unless films are based around drug use/taking and display the negative and destructive sides of their use, my firm view is that they should NOT appear in films in such a trivialising manner. Drugs destoy lives. The fact that this film only has a (UK) certification of '15' I find staggering: censors... just say ""no"".In summary: great concept, with great potential, but poorly executed.(If you enjoyed this review, please check out my other reviews on bob-the-movie-man.com, and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"".

Life's just too damn short for crap films.Sex Tape is the latest comedy thud from Bad Teacher director, Jake Kasdan and stars Jason Segal and Cameron Diaz as Jay and Annie, a married couple who spice up their romance with a sex tape. Somehow Jay manages to simultaneously upload the sex tape to every iPad they have in the house, and they have several because that's the kind of job he has and it means he can give one to the in-laws, friends, postman Yawn. And guess what? Yup, they give away those iPads and then have to find them all before anyone watches them getting jiggy with each other.There are too many flaws and plot holes to detail here but one stands out: As an iPad tumbles out of a window somebody, probably Jay, (who cares?) says, """"The construction on these things is amazing!"" It isn't! I've just returned from a job where we had about 350 in use and three delegates managed to drop them from waist height (i.e. substantially lower than upstairs window height) and all three now have drastically rearranged features and don't work terribly well now.

The best scene is when the young daughter Nell (Giselle Eisenberg) makes the observation as she is on her way to school that is ""this what life is about?"" You get up do your stuff, sleep and get up and do it over again. The dad, Jay (Jason Segal) tries to share that it is not true. The premise of the story is that Annie (Carmen Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) have lost their mojo. They simply are not having sex. In order to spice things up, Annie recommends to Jay that they film themselves doing the dirty. Well, it did spice things up but the video was spread among friends. The stigma of a sex tape has lost it's scarlet letter appeal and in today's world seems to help, aka Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton to name a few. But in the magic of Hollywood, Annie and Jay fight and scramble to discover all the lost copies. Sex Tape is tamer than the trailer leads us to believe but its real message is keeping the fire hot in a marriage is hard but there is a lot more to a good marriage than hot sex.",Sex Tape

The script and direction are so undisciplined, it's ridiculous. The scenes go on for 10 times too long. The editing is so frenetic that they're afraid to linger on a frame for more than two seconds. The basic plot is a plausible one - a bored couple make a drunken sex tape. The husband forgets to erase it, and after copies are mistakenly duplicated to friends' iPads, the couple frantically try to find out who has it so they can erase it. But mostly the characters sit and argue with each other or get stoned. The actors are capable of comedy, and Cameron Diaz in particular tries hard, but the dialogue is so over-written and uninteresting, it gets monotonous. The movie must have been written and shot in a hurry, because anyone who bothered to read or see it twice would see it needs a major rewrite, and re-cut. I have seen worse movies, and this is not a complete turkey. But in the end it was boring. Not a good outcome for a movie called Sex Tape.",Sex Tape

Cameron Diaz (still luminous and mugging for all she's worth) and Jason Segel (oddly scrawny, especially in a surreal face-off with a huge dog) play Annie and Jay, a frazzled married couple with kids, who - when they try to spice up their marriage again one night by making a hilariously epic sex tape - must spend the rest of the movie atoning for their sexual transgressions. It's, unfortunately, a mostly flaccid attempt at humour - it tries to be saucy, perky and rude, with an added dollop of heart, but winds up lame and not particularly funny. There are a couple of interesting cameos from Rob Lowe (wigging out weirdly as Diaz's potential boss) and an uncredited Jack Black but, just like the titular sex tape, this really didn't need to be distributed to a wider audience.",Sex Tape

Very straightforward storyline - married couple with kids tries to get the romance back, so they decide to film themselves having sex. It then is synced to all their friends' iPads and they have to retrieve them. I would like to say hilarity then ensues, but it doesn't.The cast, mostly Segel & Diaz, plus Corddry & Kemper, Lowe & Black are all quite charming/engaging in their own way, but the main fault with the film is that it's all been done before. Sure, it's a new premise, but it's based on the same old ""couple-trying-to-get-their-mojo-back"" plot and sadly there's not that many laughs to be had. A few chuckles here and there, but no truly funny laugh-out-loud moments.Basically, the best bits are in the trailer and if you're going hoping to see nudity, there's - unfortunately - plenty of Segel's butt!

Nothing feels at stake for these two dim bulb characters because they barely register as anything more than actors trying to be hip and funny and the last thing they come across as are a believable couple or even human. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper tag along on the search as their friends and because the lazy script couldn't even find a good line or something for these two talented people to do, they are wasted in throwaway supporting roles. Jake Kasdan, who is capable of so much more than this, directs with no style or care and the film feels like it turned to vapor before the last act ends.

However instead it felt as though the premise was a bit bizarre in my opinion since I believe that the film could have taken a whole different direction but I think the direction of the screenplay limits that. While Jason Siegel and Cameron Diaz are decent as jay and Annie, but it feels as though the characters that are more funny are the supporting characters which include rob coddry and rob Lowe as Annie's boss.

Now this is a perfect example of a great concept that morphs into a really bland and unfunny movie. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal play a bored married couple trying to spice things up. For the sake of the film, these characters are needed but the actors in the roles are surprisingly typecast at this point. Jason Segal plays an R-rated version of his How I Met Your Mother character and it doesn't exactly benefit him at this point because these are the roles he is now stuck in. He's very good at what he does but this is the one film where his performance grows weary about mid way through. Cameron Diaz isn't much better either, while she does generate a couple chuckles it still isn't nearly enough to help it. The supporting cast featuring Rob Lowe and Rob Corddry do generate most of the laughs, it again doesn't make for anything of a redeeming quality. Jake Kasdan directs from a poorly executed screenplay that features a great idea and glimpses of its genius in some of its twists but they are not enough to set this comedy apart from the million other R rated comedies that have come and gone. Much like Bad Teacher, this film has maybe two good scenes while the rest become bogged down with useless crude jokes for the sake of having a R rating. Overall, Sex Tape marks another disappointing comedy with its overtly crude for the sake of being crude scenes and flat performances.",Sex Tape

It's one of the funniest and most original comedies I've seen since The Hangover and it was on pace for a 10/10 rating. Then the writers had the ultimate fail and ruined the plot.The film follows Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as they go from young lovers to married with children who don't have the same love life they once did in their youth. In order to spice things up, they decide to make a sex tape and record it with Segel's iPad. In a sharing snafu their intimate moment is shared with everyone who has been an iPad by Segel in the past... approximately half a dozen people. Now the adventure begins. The two of them have to go track down these iPads and delete the video from them before their friends and family members discover the newly added flick. Oh man are there some amazingly hilarious scenes. Unfortunately, the writers didn't understand how awesome this was and after acquiring one of them, the movie takes a drastic turn for the worse. Instead of making a film where they go from adventure to more chaotic adventure, the movie loses much of its excitement after being confronted and blackmailed by a ten year old. After this point, while there were still a few funny moments, the movie was largely predictable and lacked the same feeling and magic.Overall I still suggest the movie to people who don't mind crude humor but it's no longer the must watch that it could've and should've been.",Sex Tape

Or you are highly addicted to anything related to Ipads. And that's the thing, this movie feels more of a TV advert for an Ipad than an actual movie.A 1 rating is probably not in line with what I think of this. I would give it a minus 3 if I could. Not only did it waste my time, I now also hate my Ipad!!",Sex Tape
78,loco_73,Forget this Sex Tape...and make your own!,6,27 July 2014,"Let me begin by saying that the only reason I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 review is for the few glorious minutes that Ms. Diaz's fantabulous body is on the screen...yes it is sexist of me, I know, but she looks so darn good!!!! Another reason I gave it a higher rating than it deserves, is that there is obvious on-screen chemistry between Cameron and Jason Siegel, something that was quite apparent to all those who saw ""Bad Teacher"", a much better and funnier movie than ""Sex Tape"".I guess that ""Sex Tape"" tries to capitalize on that, casting both these likable and bankable stars as leads in yet another R-rated comedic outing. Unfortunately this time around it doesn't work, actually nothing works! Both Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel are let down by a pretty shabby script and sloppy directing. The supporting cast doesn't fare any better. There are glimpses of what this movie could have been, as in watching straight-laced, real-life Ned Flanders character type, as embodied by Rob Lowe, gleefully go off the rails...in a cocaine induced stupor...But though the movie exhibits brief moments of fun and humour, the vast majority of time you'll spend watching this movie is one tired, clichéd, stale bit after another.The set-up and premise of this movie might be great, but the execution is terrible and unfunny! In recent years a new trend of movies started, which Hollywood lost no opportunity to exploit, featuring ageing couples that struggle to find balance in their lives, juggling work, children, bills, mortgage payments and a fading romantic and sex life. A premise which given the current climate the US is facing, foreclosures, unemployment, widening income gap, I find quite idyllic and unrealistic...but whatever...We had ""I Love You Man"", ""Hall Pass"", ""This Is 40"" and more recently ""Neighbours"". ""I Love You Man"", which also stars Mr. Siegel, I would say is the best and funniest of the bunch. But this trend has to stop because its subsequent incarnations are becoming worse and worse! Of course no one in Hollywood will pay any attention to that as long as they can squeeze a few bucks out of this whole enterprise.One other fact I have to mention. I have never been against product placement per se, when its all tied into the story and it makes sense without being too obvious, like let's say ""Minority Report"", but ""Sex Tape"" is a whole other kettle of fish.I mean, I get that for whatever reason the couple (Siegel and Diaz) decide to use an Apple IPad to record their business (why people are still using ANY Apple products is beyond me) and that is fine. But then the presence of Apple goes from ubiquitous to front and centre and I swear if you look at it, this movie can be seen as one long, commercial or love song, to Apple Inc.!!!! At one point Mr. Segel's character, after dropping an IPad from a second floor window, exclaims about how ""well build"" they are...Not cool, not cool at all! For a movie with a suggestive title and an R-rating, this movie is nowhere near as raunchy and explicit as some might expect!

It wasn't a film that was full of laughs but it had a few and in general I was smirking most of the way through. Yes it is silly but its certainly not the worst comedy film I've seen. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel have a good on screen chemistry once again , as they also did in 2011 comedy, Bad Teacher. The film is straight to the point and to me it flowed along quite nicely despite some cringe worthy moments. The humor is pretty crude but it certainly could have been ruder, I did expect there to be some actual nudity but that wasn't the case. The plot did come a little ridiculous/predictable towards the end but overall I still enjoyed the movie enough to watch it the whole way through with no issues (Cameron Diaz's charm and sexiness being the main factor). I was going to rate it 6/10 but towards the end when the actual tape was shown, I couldn't stop laughing at the flip move that Cameron Diaz done 3 times! Best bit of the film for me.7/10.",Sex Tape

If I have to define this movie in one word it would be ""too long"". This film is too long. An hour and a half of this story is too long. Every scene is just a bit too long. It's kind of a messy movie. I'm disappointed as Jason Segel is a pretty funny guy, he's proved himself to be a capable comedy writer. Cameron Diaz used to be pretty great at comedy but now she just starred in terrible comedy. This film was not even funny, not one single joke made me laugh. I can't believe that so many pretty good people gathered in a room and decided to make this film. All the character are unrealistic and fake, they look like they just come back from the most stupid cartoons ever. They tried to set up a realistic relationship between a man and a woman and their marriage which is gotten to a point where it's not really working anymore; but they failed. What shocked me the most is that Sex Tape is a Sony Pictures movie... with so many Apple products. Everyone is using an Ipad or a MacBook a whole bunch of time, talking about their features, showing their features and getting a tone of advertising from Apple. Overall if you've seen the trailer for Sex Tape, not only you've seen every single part which is even remotely funny but you know exactly where the story is going.

83,FilmMuscle,An Unexciting and Safe-played Sex Tape,4,28 July 2014,"Sex Tape—starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal as an exhausted married couple—promises a bountiful supply of raunchiness, nudity, and sexual jokes, judging from its countless advertisements and summaries. The premise centers around the fact that this couple—far into their marriage and frankly too tired from their daily family responsibilities to return to their formerly active sex life—finally decides to shoot a sex tape in which they present all the various sex positions that can possibly spring into one's imagination and then some more. Suddenly, the following morning, they discover that their little sex tape has surfaced onto every single iPad that Segal gifted to their friends and coworkers, including Diaz's boss (Rob Lowe). They are then forced into a frantic race to ensure that not one of them is able to lay their eyes on it. The premise seems to lay the groundwork for a fairly exciting and fun comedy from the sound of it. However, once the movie quickly zooms past the making of the sex tape (an area of great potential for sex jokes and whatnot) and gets right into the conflict, all hope is lost. With a title like ""Sex Tape,"" an R rating, and an explicitly titillating premise, you'd expect something completely different from what you actually get, which means that you seriously feel like you've been misled by the tricky people behind this project. Instead, the movie plays as a traditional PG-13 comedy that's devoid of any hint of edginess. With that being said, the film has its funny moments, but they ultimately stem from the (intentionally) awkward and ridiculously unrealistic scenes. Every opportunity at a clever play on the idea of a sex tape is painstakingly passed over—even one of its actors (Rob Lowe) who infamously produced a sex tape in the younger years of his career isn't taken advantage of here. In actuality, the director (Jake Kasdan) wasn't informed of the irony in casting Lowe for this picture, thereby proving how little thought was put into excelling this comedy. On the other hand, Lowe still remains the highlight of the entire show, providing most of the hilarity as he portrays Diaz's surprisingly bizarre, yet highly friendly, boss. In addition, there's a special cameo surprise waiting for us towards the finishing act that also shines in the brief screen time available. These two (Lowe and ""special guest"") overshadow Segal—who strangely always appears as if he's stoned out of his mind—and Diaz who usually plays the obnoxiously loud and liberally sexual type (her role in this case somewhat differs from that description, but she has nothing to offer here anyway). In terms of plot, by the end, it leads to such an outlandish point that it becomes wholly embarrassing in its implausibility for all those involved, and by then, the audience is likely laughing at the film itself more often than along with it. All in all, Diaz wasn't daring enough to take the same path Johansson took with Under the Skin and refrained from any major skin exposure—Segal did more in that department as we've come to expect after that uproariously shocking opening in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. The humor always feels like it's holding back, and nothing of special note really transpires in this overall misfire.",Sex Tape

85,vistheindian,because sex sells?,5,11 August 2014,"Quickie Review:Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) are a married couple that decide to make a sex tape to spark up the intense sex life they once used to have. Unfortunately, they wake up to discover that their video has been synced to all their family's and friend's devices. Now they must hunt down all the copies of the video before it is seen by anyone. This is an amusing premise that had the potential to be a pretty good comedy. Instead Sex Tape just delivers on a few chuckles and no way nears the potential. In the end it comes off as just another generic, forgettable comedy.Full Review:This was not a comedy that I was highly anticipating this year (let alone as a movie in general). Then again who doesn't want to go to the cinema to have some good laughs? So that is all that I wanted from this movie, but nope it did the bare minimum.Now I don't want to totally rip this movie apart. For instance Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel actually had a pretty good chemistry together on screen. There is a pretty funny cameo that I didn't see coming. Wow that's it? I'm actually stumped on the positivesWell, I guess I could totally rip this movie apart because there are many things at fault that I can point out. However, it all ultimately comes down to one thing: Sex Tape is just an extended version of a 22min comedy episode. That is root from which all other problems stem. You actually feel the writers trying to drag out the scenes as long as possible and beyond, to get a decent run-time to call it a movie. There are scenes that start of alright, you may even chuckle at it but it keeps dragging on and on and on. So you end up having to endure pretty poor attempts at jokes that are just scene fillers. There were several times I just wanted the scene to end so that we can move on with the movie. Much the same way, even the supporting characters feel like they are just fillers. They are just there to do one type of joke every time they are on-screen. So much so that when a character does show up, you know exactly what type of joke is coming up next.I think the only way you'd enjoy this movie more is if you didn't even know this movie existed, saw no trailers, and one day you catch it on TV while browsing channels. Then you might just find it to be a good time killing movie. Honestly apart from the cameo, all the best jokes were shown in the trailer. Thank you Hollywood marketing. So there you have it, even with my low expectations I was not fully entertained and I think that will be the case with many others. I don't recommend paying to see it in cinemas. Just stream it on Netflix or something.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Sex Tape
86,rawiri42,Well I laughed!,7,11 July 2015,"I haven't clicked the spoilers button for this movie since I feel that, if the title doesn't warn anyone who is prudish not to watch it, what would? However, if IMDb want to add a spoiler alert then that's OK with me.So, having got that out of the way, on to the movie. The overall rating on IMDb (51) is a lot lower than my score (75) and one reviewer seems to have picked up on why that may be where he says that he felt it was more tailored to the British sense of humour than the American. That is interesting inasmuch that the film IS an American one so obviously some Americans think that way. Anyway, I was born in Britain and I thought ""Sex Tape"" was hilarious.Yes, there were a few scenes (like the altercation with the dog) where it became a bit stupid and I put those down to the American ""slapstick""-type humour (yes, humour DOES have a U in it!) which I usually detest. However, in the context of this movie, I actually thought that stupid humour was appropriate. Let's face it, the whole movie is (and I firmly believe was intended to be) ridiculous. Now that I'm no longer married, I really wish I had made some footage of my wife and I ""playing"" because it was pretty good and now I don't have it. I actually wonder just how many openly honest married couples have actually done exactly what Jay and Annie did in ""Sex Tape"" to keep as a memento of their younger days for when they get older and slow down a bit. After all, whether the prudes like it or not, sex IS a very important part of a marriage relationship and also one of the most fun parts, The prudes video their holidays and other family events for posterity so why not video the best of all? No one but the participants want to watch other people's home videos anyway so what's the big deal?Another aspect that I saw as more typically American was that Jay had given a number of i-Pads to friends and associates. Who the hell does that? None of my friends ever gave me anything that expensive! And, if he could afford that, what was all the concern about paying Howard $25k?Since practically everyone that mattered to Jay and Annie eventually knew about the tape anyway, what would have been a great alternative ending to the movie would have been for them to put it onto YouTube with an appropriate advertising link and then get paid for every time it was viewed. I have heard about people who have been fortunate to capture interesting and very unusual events on video who have done that and made millions from it.",Sex Tape
87,TheSeaLion,This is a nothing movie,1,25 July 2014,"""In my experience, the shorter the joke, the more effective. Ten seconds is hilarious, four minutes is embarrassing,""-Hope Chapman. This quote is perfect for describing ""Sex Tape"" starring Cameron Diaz (Annie) and Jason Segel (Jay). Even if every attempted joke didn't go on for five minutes, they were not funny to begin with and there are so many problems, big and small, that this movie has that it is almost impossible to see anything positive that came from this abomination that has been passed off as a movie.Being married for several years and now with two kids (Sebastian Hedges Thomas and Giselle Eisenberg), Annie and Jay decide to make a sex tape in an attempt to rekindle how their relationship was early on when they first met. Jay does not release the tape afterwards and accidentally sends it out to everyone he's ever bought an iPad for, including their friends Robby (Rob Corddry) and his wife Tess (Ellie Kemper), Annie's possible new boss Hank (Rob Lowe), and even their mailman (Dave Allen). With the help of Robby and Tess, Annie and Jay set out to recover all of the iPads in order to keep their sex tape a secret.What is just incredible to me is that this film lacks any pacing. Not only does this movie already have the premise of a thirty minute sitcom episode that is now being lengthened to film length, but so little actually happens in the movie. By the premise, you'd think that Annie and Jay would spend most of the movie going to their friends houses and trying to get their iPads without revealing why they need them back. However, a good chunk of the movie is spent at Hank's house. For thirty minutes we see paintings of Hank put into Disney movies, Annie doing cocaine to distract Hank, and Jay being chased around by Hank's dog. None of it is funny and it is the same three jokes going on for thirty minutes.A twist (I guess that's what you'd call it) is revealed that Robby and Tess' son Howard (Harrison Holzer) got the tape, made a copy of it, and put it online and will only take it off if Annie and Jay give him $25,000. Howard's motivations are not established ahead of time so when it is revealed he put the video online, his entire motivation is established right then and there, two-thirds of the way through the movie. This movie actually has a worse humor style than the potty humor of an Adam Sandler film or a Michael Bay film because, even though those films are not funny, there is at least the start of some sort of joke in it all. In ""Sex Tape"" the majority of the humor is just having the characters run around shouting out swears. There is no joke to any of it, it's just people cursing. It might be funny if the cursing was part of some sort of punchline, but it isn't. It is just swearing for the sake of swearing. Now, I have no problem with swearing in movies, but I do have a problem with it when it is used as the main source of humor in a film and it isn't funny. Then, when the movie isn't just using characters swearing, it uses pop cultural references and the jokes that the opening quote described. The pop cultural references aren't even spoofing things from culture, it is just the characters making reference to them, such as ""Lincoln"" or ""Breaking Bad"". ""Sex Tape"" is just pathetic. There is not a single redeemable quality that you can take from this movie. Sure, I like Ellie Kemper and Rob Lowe in other stuff, but they weren't given anything funny to work with in this so they are wasted. I guess if I could pull one good thing from the movie, it would be that it is not the worst movie I've ever seen.",Sex Tape

To the point, I thought my back would give out. hahaha. It centered around a couple who was sex mad in earlier years. Annie(Diaz) introduces the film by at the same time Blogging. eheehh. She tells us all how sex mad they were and still are. Then when the children came along it took slightly more effort to get sex. Then Jay(Segal - Who might I add has either changed or aged so much, that I hardly recognsied him). In fact I took to him in the film. The last I would have seen him was in How I Met Your Mother. As we later learn that the reason t hey made the Sex Tape was to fill a void in their lives. We learned this from non other than YouPorn.com staff(Black). They first learn of the Sex Tape being ""leaked"" onto the web, at a Children's' party of some form, when Jay gets a text, saying that he loves the video etc., So the couple go on a frantic search. During the search, it is explained that Jay's job has something to do with iPads, and hence he used the iPad to record the sex acts. Then it is explained to us, that anything that's on the iPad is synced to the Cloud using an ""awesome"" app Frankensync. So it got out onto the web. They turned to their neighbors, Tess(Kemper) and Robby(Corddry) thinking they are the ones who sent the text initially. When they learned it wasn't, they just went around wanting ALL the iPads back to delete the video. Jay gave it to his Mom(Waldman), from Annie's boss Hank(Lowe), from Tess and Robby. It is then revealed that it is Tess' and Robby's kid Howard(Holzer), was the one who actually sent the text. He blackmailed Jay to get $25,000. When he refused, he uploaded to YouPorn site etc., etc.,.So with all the shenanigans, I can't really fault the film. You are warned by means of the Censorship(Irish Film Board), with the language and content. Bottomline, Very good. Great plot. Most enjoyable.

But they are a family in this travesty, with little kids, yet they think it is hilarious being low-life scum bags. Why? Because shocking and drowning the middle class with the most amoral behavior became Hollywood's mission during the Obama era. Of course, every other film is a race bait, anti-white tirade of some sort they all believe we deserve after $2 trillion in programs we paid for aimed at minorities, and subjecting ourselves to a school curriculum with no educational purpose other than shaming Americans. This puerile, vile, hate speech targeted at those few of us that still believe this is a great country, will make traditional people nauseous.

93,bbrebozo,Sex Tape - Cameron Diaz = 0,6,30 March 2015,"I'm giving Sex Tape the relatively high rating of 6 for two reasons: (1) Cameron Diaz, and (2) naked Cameron Diaz.This film involves extreme horniness, raunchy sex, violence, corporate hypocrisy, profanity, breaking and entering, vandalism, animal cruelty, pornography, and drug use. All from a bunch of characters who are supposed to come across as lovable scamps, but actually come across as really creepy -- and not terribly funny or entertaining.The exception is Cameron Diaz. She is a very talented comic actress, who has the gift of being both beautiful and relate-able, and for being able to act in somewhat shifty and skanky ways while retaining her likability and basic innocence. The only laugh-out-loud moment for me in the film was when she did a line of cocaine and started acting like...well, like someone who had never done much cocaine before. And her nude and semi-nude scenes -- oh my gosh, she looks like an angel from heaven. Sadly, the price you have to pay for seeing Cameron Diaz naked is seeing much more of Jason Segel naked.WARNING: There is a scene at the end where, for absolutely no good reason, a nearly-naked Jason Segel stands there and sings a long, long version of Take Me Out to the Ball Game or something, with his privatest of parts threatening to pop out and say ""howdy"" at any moment. ONCE YOU HAVE SEEN THIS, IT CAN NEVER BE UNSEEN.The uncredited but popular comic actor who makes a cameo at the end as the owner of YouPorn starts out great, but his part degenerates into him reciting a lot of ""funny"" pornography site names for what seems like hours.With the always-engaging and gorgeous Cameron Diaz, I give this film a 6.

The story-line is a little weak, and requires that the audience believe this couple was giving out iPads like they were business cards.As a farce comedy along the lines of 'Horrible Bosses' or 'Hall Pass', the casting of Jason Segel was a terrible mistake. He seems sullen and miserable and utterly unconvincing in this role. Ashton Kutcher or Jason Sudeikis might have elevated the whole mood of the film and worked with Cameron Diaz with much better chemistry.Seems very unfair that Diaz got a golden raspberry for worst actress; she was the saving grace of this poorly-written mess.",Sex Tape

I hope she was well paid for having wasted her time and her talents in this monstrosity. A note to Mr. Segal. While you have certain abilities as an actor, you are not a screen writer. This is evidenced here. Your script stinks. The dialog is worse. In spots it literally made me cringe. Until you took your clothes off. Then things really went flaccid. (Sorry. I couldn't resist.) In addition Mr. Segel, your penis is not worth the price of admission. You were short changed by God. I, in turn, was shorted by you when the ticket money left my account. You do not have a particularly attractive roaring toward middle age body. You and your other aging frat boy pals like Hader, Rogan and so forth are generally pale, pasty, out of shape and uninteresting when nude.

96,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Sex Tape Review,6,18 July 2014,"Summary:Trying to get back the sex life that Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) had before they got married and had kids, they decide to make a sex tape and do every position in the ""Joy of Sex"" book. Instead of erasing the video like Annie wanted, Jay accidentally uploads it and syncs it to all of the iPads that he has given out to family and friends. Now they have to spend the night going around collecting the iPads and deleting the video.My Thoughts:What do we get with Sex Tape? The trailers and summary kind of tell us all we need to know. Jay and Annie had tons of sex before they got married, and then with work, kids, and other things getting in the way, that all changed, and now they try to schedule the next time they have sex.This movie does provide you with a good amount of laughs, some that we have seen in the trailers and some that we have not seen. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper who play Robby and Tess, best friends to Jay and Annie, bring some great comedic scenes. Rob Lowe (who plays Hank, the CEO of a company Annie is trying to get to buy her blog) plays a great roll that we don't really see him in quite often and has a great scene when they visit him at his house.And, like a lot of these comedies nowadays, we do get some great cameos of people that you aren't expecting to pop up, and they do steal the show while on the screen.But as much as I want to say ""go see this movie"" due to the cameos and some of the jokes that are in it, it did not have me laughing throughout the movie as 22 Jump Street and Neighbors did. Just like last year with movies such as We're the Millers, This is the End, and World's End, this year has been a great time for R-rated comedies, but that also makes it a tough crowd to get a foothold in. My Recommendation:This movie is funny, but I don't think it is funny enough to spend your money at the theaters; wait for it to come out on DVD or Redbox.",Sex Tape
97,InMyHonestOpinion,One of the worst films ever made especially for these two very talented people,1,26 December 2014,"So if we're going to be honest I guess there are times in each of our relationships that we've ever had or will ever have where things begin to go slow. For a while I guess we contemplate on what it is that has dried up and how do we get over it, what is it that has gone so wrong when all was going so well before. Then of course the majority of the time we will ""try"" something new to renew our relationships and get them back on track to where they need or should be. In the case of Sex Tape Jay played by Jason Segel (How I met your mother, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and Annie played by Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels, The Mask) are a long time married couple who have lost their spark, but it only happened since their two children were born, before the kids they went at ""it"" like bunnies literally anywhere, everywhere and at any time. The two decided after getting a night alone to bring back that spark after such a long absence they will make a sex tape, they get hold of the book ""the joys of sex"" and decide they will film themselves in every position the book teaches. What happens the next day though is the film is accidentally released to the cloud and sent to all friends of Jay and Annie whom Jay has given an IPad too previously with a set list of his favourite music. The majority of them film then centers around the two travelling from each of their friends' homes including Annie's potential new boss to retrieve the IPad they were given, the film quickly goes from one tragic event to the next as the pair try everything they can to get their IPad back This film should work, it's a great idea, has great lead actors who have proved time and time again they are pretty awesome in their chosen field of acting, yet it doesn't. It's like a film made by horny teenagers all adding their bits and pieces individually then given to the editor to mash it all together. The script is horrendous, it's filthy vulgar and in so many places just so unnecessary. Of course there are the moments where it's meant to be vulgar and crass after all the film's title will tell you that itself, there are just so many scenes where it is over the top and for no real reason. Add to the cast Rob Lowe, Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper and that's about it, no one stands out except for maybe the neighbours son Howard who does get a few pretty good scenes later in the film. Probably the most apparent and very annoying thing about the film though is the way ""Apple"" is everywhere which makes things very odd for a film produced by Sony pictures. It is so forced upon us there is hardly a scene where we don't see and ""apple"" logo somewhere, the only relief is with Hank Annie's potential new boss who uses something different as a phone, and home Wi-Fi unit but we never see a brand we just know it's not Apple. Unfortunately I think the only people who will really enjoy this film are those who still laugh at the word penis or vagina being used so In other words twelve year olds or those who still have that metal thought pattern. I'd say avoid this film and definitely keep it away from the kids or those with a weak heart!",Sex Tape

101,videodrome1234,Oh my God...,3,23 August 2014,"I'm not a big fan of either Cameron Diaz or newer comedies. There are few quality works coming out in this genre now a days. When in the 80s classic comedies were born one after the other. Now it's just shallow mostly and there are only a few exceptions 21 and 22 Jump Street, and a few of Cameron Diaz's films, not The Other Woman but Bad Teacher was a good one that entertained me and was the best comedy in a long while. When the news 1st broke on the film there was even gossip that it would be Bad Teacher 2 then it turned out it wasn't that but all is good BT 2 is coming too. When the 1st trailer came out we got exactly what the title suggests and they blew all the funniest jokes in the trailer too. I felt disappointed. When Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) first got together, their romantic connection was intense - but ten years and two kids later, the flame of their love needs a spark. To kick things up a notch, they decide - why not? - to make a video of themselves trying out every position in The Joy of Sex in one marathon three-hour session. It seems like a great idea - until they discover that their most private video is no longer private. With their reputations on the line, they know they're just one click away from being laid bare to the world... but as their race to reclaim their video leads to a night they'll never forget, they'll find that their video will expose even more than they bargained for. The whole time the advertised the film with the line from the creators of BT. It would be good to know that if the film wasn't missing the most important aspect of a comedy: The script. They didn't right it. Neither did they write BT 2 and the script was what was good about BT1. The actors did their job, but what really made it good was the script, so here it's a major problem that there was no script or at least I didn't feel like there was one. There are 3 names the script is credited to, Jason Segel being one, but it's really like there isn't one. So what do you need for a script? A basic concept – it has one but it's not too great – and good characters – and that's really lacking in this film. Most of them are unrealistic and over emoted so the script is lacking here. And 'cause this is a comedy it wouldn't hurt the script if it had a few jokes maybe a one liner? Anything? Something? Anything that is remotely funny is spoiled by the trailer anyway. The amount is on the level of the jokes in The Other Women. Which honestly wasn't a high level. If this was an indy cos production that was being made for TV then I wouldn't be surprised but in the last little while this is the 2nd big budget Cameron Diaz comedy that is basically subpar at least compared to what they boasted. I have no problem with the actress but I have the feeling that she doesn't even read the scripts she's offered cause they just keep getting worse. Maybe the biggest problem is Jason Segel who is supposedly a good comic but it just doesn't come out here even if he had a hand in the script. All in all if you want to see a good comedy watch 22 JS again even the 2nd time around it'll be funnier than this. 3/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog",Sex Tape

I would say so-so to less than ordinary movie. At first, I was gonna rate it 4/10, but something in Sex Tape change my verdict.The acting is not that good. Jason Segel still delivered the cheesy acts that were only intended for a serial television movie. While for Diaz, well she should be able to do better with her act, though we must admit, there's little to none 'better-act' in this kind of comedy-flick.But one thing I did praise from this movie is the morale itself. Jack Black, although not credited, delivered the message clearly. If there's a quick and easy solution to lift up your life, then it's (probably) only just a temporary solution with bigger problem that got left behind and went unresolved. It's actually a pretty straightforward hit for anyone with family and perhaps it could actually open up your eyes and heart.So, for the message of life from Jack Black, I would consider upped my rating to 5/10.

103,VenturousArtist,"""Delete the .MP4 file.""",1,11 October 2018,"Sex Tape isn't a pleasant comedy to watch. It's awkwardly timed, written, and portrayed even with its seemingly interesting list of actors known for their comedic attributes. However, the film merely utilizes their potential with middling effort that leads into middling results. It follows a married couple who were previously sexually active until obtaining offspring. Their story involves an unfortunate incident with their recorded sexually explicit adventures being accidentally shared to others without their consent or knowledge.During their strange adventure to find any device, and anyone withholding the devices, that contains the file sounds intriguing but ends with endless humdrum ideas. Their problem could easily be resolved but their predicament is foolishly approached with overly ridiculous encounters. There's many instances of interesting ideas but they're treated like a terribly written sitcom and cartoon merged together.Although badly written, some smaller redeeming qualities come from the performances from the leading actors. Their ballsy devotion to the film's premise is deeply shocking but also strangely charming. Their chemistry balances the profoundly dumb ideas throughout but also harms their performances as it makes them seem dumber than the writing. Stupidity seems to be encouraged in this story as nobody either sensibly speaks or acts sooner to prevent any unwanted dilemmas.It's a brainless comedy about sex that makes the sex less appealing. It's not funny enough to make sex acceptably awkward. It's not carefully crafted to allow the actors to explore interesting elements into this awkward story. But worst of all, it's just not sexy enough to be a worthwhile porno. It would be easier to just search for real sexually explicit videos elsewhere with their badly produced content to actually feel justified. Just delete the .MP4 file.

I mean I wasn't expecting anything deep and meaningful, how could you when the title of the movie is Sex Tape!After 20mins the whole premise for the entire movie is done and dusted.

It didn't work..a better example of how to make this movie would be Zack and Miri Make a Porno. That movie was in no way perfect, or even close to it, but it felt a little more like an R rated movie than this one.

The over usage of f-bombs every other scene for zero affect or purpose to the script or character development, and just merely as an ""adult"" filler-word bc the writers are too ignorant to utilize another word in order to express their emotions. Pointless and redundant. 2. The ""jokes"" and I use that term lightly, were ssssoooo forced and legitimately clichés of past movies combined.

My wife has brought home some chick flick bombs and this was alright.That said this movie is not really all about the sex tape. Its about bored people trapped in parenting and actually not liking it. Most of the people in this movie loathe being parents. They are socially pretentious awkward people who just can't figure out what the hell happened to the people they thought they were. Reduced to actually enjoying themselves in the few stolen moments in time when they can finally be alone. The real scary things in this movie is ignorance, and the fact that a lot of people give up who they are entirely to fake it at being a parent.Now that said. this movie is kinda dull. you could have a better evening watching lobsters knife fight or trying to build a jet pack for a snake.",Sex Tape

I know people weren't necessarily more innocent in say the 70s , 60s. However this is some red neck garbage. A couple attempting to make love is saying ""I want to f*** you so bad."" "" f*** me"". It's not funny, it's actually sad... really sad... and small. This movie is an abusive mentality towards men and women. It's basically about two talking apes that f*** each other on video because of their porno obsession , who refuse to grow up... and accidentally upload it on line.The sort of mentality this movie has is intoxicating. I'm actually angry, upset setting here. Every other word is f***.. and these people are some real white trash here. This movie is s**** and degrading.This movie is an insulting image of a woman and a man. The woman "" f**** this , f**** that, f*** me, I'm a dirty c** w****... love me because I f**** you, f**** me...."" I can appreciate dirty comedy, they have done it in the previous decades but this movie is really... really concerning. I pray to god that this movie isn't any true or accurate representation of couples today. This is not the kind of crap I want to come out, I do have standards. I'm sorry for being prudish but I do have standards and I am concerned for our future as human beings.I am deeply concerned for couples that are this petty, daft and small minded. The movie swears a lot... I guess to be a grown up comedy... but it's not funny, not at all.The lead actress looks and acts like a porn star... might of well been a Megan Fox movie. That would have made it the most honest film.I'm not enjoying the movie at all, some of it might be mildly funny, it's how f*** up these characters are that frightens me.I am a little conservative, I got nothing against sex though. I just feel that this feel has some very immature and probably negative representations of two young adults exploring their sexuality.This movie is like a soft core porn with lots of story...People might find parts of it funny, but what its characters represent scare the hell out of me, it will continue as long as people blindly accept it and watch it. It's immoral , indecent, abusive mind wash.

116,theSachaHall,A Nostracockass Bore,3,17 November 2014,"Despite having a deliciously naughty and marketable premise to work with and an equally engaging lead in Cameron Diaz (THE OTHER WOMAN), it was a disappointment to discover that Jake Kasdan's SEX TAPE is a 'nostracockass' bore. With its predictable mélange of post marriage clichés and forced one-liners, the film's humour is about as funny as realising as an impressionable teenager that the dog-eared copy of The Joy of Sex shelved in plain sight on the family room bookcase was not placed there by you. Yet as eye bleaching as that memory remains, it's also a subtle reminder that once that proverbial cherry is popped; sex continues to be an integral and evolutionary part of our adult lives. And on rare (or numerous) occasions, it generates such passion that it impels us to consider crazy things – like making home movies with props like roller-skates. Striving to bring their own sexy back, Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) decide to do just that; a 70's style shag-a-thon with a modern edge thanks to the new and improved Apple iPad. Jay's post-coital decision to save their 3 hour video leads them on an inevitable erasure chase when it's discovered that the kept file synched to his cloud enabled devices; most of which, Jay no longer owns. After deleting the file from Annie's mother, Linda's iPad, Diaz and Segel head to Robby (Rob Corddry) and Tess' (Ellie Kemper) house who, excited by this turn of event, decide to tag along to the home of Piper Brother's CEO Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe). The ensuing sequence is a strange, mish-mash of ridiculous actions that are neither funny nor entertaining. At least Lowe appears to be having fun from the other side of the fence as Ned Flanders with a wild side. But who wouldn't have fun if your partner in crime were Ms Diaz.Unsurprisingly, the film continues to disappoint as the writers introduce a blackmailing plot. The only saving grace at this point is the uncredited appearance of Jack Black as an Internet porn king and owner of porn streaming site YouPorn. The 60-second throw down of absurd porn site names is hilarious, worth waiting for, and pretty much sums up the feeling that you just have to laugh at how bad it really is.Overall, you can take SEX TAPE like the The Joy of Sex's suggestion regarding wearing spiked boots whilst in flagrante. While it may sound titillating in its ideal, the actuality of the experience might cause you unintended pain.You can catch me at my handle and at The Hollywood News.",Sex Tape
117,benoit_03,"Rompy middle-aged fun, held together by Segel.",6,7 September 2014,"Ever wondered about making a sex tape? If so, you won't any longer after seeing this. After making their own 3 hour (come on now....) long sex tape, Jason Segel's syncing app distributes it to several second hand iPads they have given friends and family. Cue the humour.It's something a little different, a take on a comedy that hasn't been done this way before. Aimed majorly at viewers who have hit a midlife crisis and may be able to relate with the film's premise, it provides a few laughs - mainly from Segel - and a reliable 'oops, look what we've done' plot.Diaz and Segel's on screen chemistry is fun and you can tell there are a few genuine laughs between the two, especially during the scene of making the tape, making it all that more believable. Appearances from other comedy actors add to the mix, and Rob Lowe turns up in an underwhelming 20 minute role as Diaz' boss.Newcomer Harrison Holzer is a decent little actor as the best friends' son and plays a funny little twist in the story.Other than the laughs, you won't be feeling much else. There's not a lot of 'all you need is family' moments, which is a good thing and is overplayed too much in many comedies, and just leaves room for some amusing Segelness. If you're a fan of his, you'll definitely be a fan of this.No doubt it will leave some pondering whether to make a tape of their own. If this film is anything to go by, then be warned. As it will, apart from the lucky few, last a sixth of the time.",Sex Tape
118,mkenyon1978,"Funny, hilarious even but pretty raunchy",8,6 September 2014,"I really enjoyed this, it was hilarious with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. It starts off with Annie and Jay, a couple who are in a rut in their relationship, their lives pretty much revolve around the kids, they still love each other, find each other attractive, but have a hard time finding time for the more intimate moments of a marriage. One night they they have something to celebrate and instead of celebrating family style, Annie decides to send the kids to grandma's for the night so she and Jay can finally get it on. They have a little difficulty getting started (things go wrong), but after a couple of shots they decide to film themselves doing all the positions in the book ""the joy of sex"". The next day, after receiving a text message, they find out that not only had Jay forgotten to delete the video, but it has also synced with all the iPads Jay had given away as gifts (their son, best friends, mailman, her mother and her boss), so now they have to retrieve all the iPads as well as figure out who has been texting Jay.... This movie won't win any awards and it wasn't the funniest thing I've seen, but it did have lots of hilarious moments and I think that Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel are both perfectly cast in their respective roles. I also really enjoyed Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper as their best friends.",Sex Tape
119,Cinobite17,One MASSIVE Apple Advert,1,15 October 2014,"This film started off well, two very likable, down to earth characters/actors, Diaz looked insanely awesome. And then suddenly, bang!, you're watching an Apple advert.And I don't mean there was obvious shots of apple products, no no, this film had scripted product placement throughout. Things like ""Oh I love my new iPad, it has a higher resolution - which means more pixels, and they upgraded the camera"" to asking Siri questions directly, controlling home automation via an iPhone, applies iCloud and a complete idiots breakdown to how you can sync data between all apple devices as well as the benefits of doing so - like sharing music. At one point I involuntarily reached for the remote to turn it off as if it was a TV commercial.What is very peculiar, however, is that this is a Sony Pictures / Columbia film and, if you've ever watched a Sony produced film you'll know that, Sony are notorious with their product placement (Resident Evil films are a classic example).The film itself is nice, funny and, again, Diaz looked insatiable. However, it fails to live up to it's potential and the apple product placement appearing so blatantly in the script just ruined it - and the sole reason for my 1/10 rating.Again, the story was nice enough and the characters likable (or dipisable depending on their role) but it just didn't come to fruition as a whole. Watch it, sure, but if you're looking for a great film along this concept ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" vastly surpasses this one and half hour apple advertisement.",Sex Tape

121,steveneven,"This ""Tape"" should have not been leaked",5,18 July 2014,"Being a fan of Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel's chemistry in Jake Kasdan's ""Bad Teacher"" (Kasdan is also the director of ""Sex Tape""), I really wanted to see this film. As with most audiences, I thought ""Bad Teacher"" was semi-entertaining, so I hoped this movie would have turned out the same. Well... when the movie is neither ""Sex-y"", or a tape, that means your title is sort of a lie. And, considering we do not see the ""sex tape"", sans some sped-up footage of it near the end, the movie is misleading in a way. Although, when you do see some sex, it is just trashy, forced, and too ridiculous to take seriously. But, can sex not be ridiculous? Just not ridiculous enough to be funny or entertaining in Kasdan's case. I am also sure that everyone knows at this point that Cameron Diaz does not show her goods. Yes, Diaz shows her butt and some side-boob, but we expected full-frontal or at least some breast nudity from Diaz considering she told us in an interview that we ""(will) see everything"". Jason Segel's nudity was pretty gross to watch, and just because he looks more toned out/thinner does not mean I am a prude. I just do not want to see your hairy butt-crack Segel, even if it is a sight gag. Come to think of it, I actually think you see more butt from Segel than Diaz. Anyway, all nudity/sex talk aside, how is the movie? This movie is not that great, but the plethora of reviews can tell you why. First off, Jason Segel is just AWFUL in this movie. His delivery is so off, it is like he is reading from a script. And, the scenes where he is serviceable, just waste his comedic ability. Cameron Diaz, contrary to most reviews, was the best part of this thing. Her comedic timing was good, she was actually pretty sexy in this movie, and I really thought this movie would have not worked without her. Of course Rob Corddy, Ellie Kemper, and Rob Lowe were pretty good in this, but is that not the case for Hollywood comedies now-a-days? The supporting cast usually eclipses the main leads in terms of delivery and timing? Moreover, the premise was weak. I am not talking about the fact that the characters in the film made a sex tape, and then it got leaked. I am talking about what happens after the sex tape. Just unbelievable, stupid, Hollywood-like circumstances that have you suspend your belief so much the film almost becomes a parody of itself. Funny enough, some of these unbelievable scenes are actually kind of humorous. Rob Lowe and Cameron Diaz actually have great chemistry, Rob Corddy's scenes were hilarious, and I would go as far as to say that the first 10 minutes or so were pretty funny. It is just that director Kasdan does not know where to take ""Sex Tape"", and you can clearly tell he runs of ideas fast. Like others have said, it is just one long, big joke.For hating it so much, why give it a passable score? If a critic told you they did not laugh a few times or that they kept looking at their watch, they are lying. This is not like ""Date Movie"" level of boredom or even any rancid Jennifer Aniston rom-com. The film has a decent pace, but there are some problems with the editing. I think the sex tape at the end was cut together very loosely, and it looked amateur. Honestly, this movie could have been directed by anyone. None of the scenes looked particularly pleasing. It is just a very plain-looking film. I guess the house looks nice. What really looked nice were the iPads and iMacs.However, what really makes me regret not giving it a ""4"" (which would not be fair considering I did not hate it THAT much), is how they tease you so much with this stupid tape, and it is not even worth all of that hype. They just tease you with the nudity. Also, the first half of this movie is just sex, sex, sex, and then the second half is just some toothless, cheese ball message about making a sex tape. It felt flat and a movie like this one cannot pull that kind of a message off.If you are looking for another great Jason Segel film, or ""Bad Teacher"" Part 2, you will be absolutely disappointed. In fact, you might loathe this film. But, if you have a more open mind than most, and you are a fan of Rob Lowe, this would be passable. I just wish the filmmakers tried more. The script definitely needed some revising, and certainly a better director would have made ""Sex Tape"" a sexier, funnier, and overall tighter production.",Sex Tape
122,sayakboral-1,Not remotely funny. Clichés and corny situations abound.,5,18 October 2014,"I'm going for a generous 5 out of 10 for this travesty only because I admire Cameron Diaz's acting skills. She's among very few female actors that can make you laugh with their sense of comic timing, the other one would possibly be Jennifer Aniston. I mean I didn't even look at the trailers and went straight ahead to buy the overpriced ticket, thinking it would simply be another roller-coaster comedy ride not very different from Bad Teacher (which is one of my favorite comedy movies) what with Bad Teacher's Jason Segel also thrown in into the potboiler. However, the whole premise was a major disappointment. The absence of a storyline was evident right from the beginning. This includes characters like that next door neighbor and the flirtatious boss, while everyone found them obnoxious, I'd venture to say these characters seemed to have been lifted straight from imbecilic pornography movies. Well as a matter of fact, this movie really lives up to its promise - it's almost like a soft-core porn flick with cheesy dialogs and overacting at every scene. Jason Segel just seems to be a happy guy, I mean it seems every 5 minutes he jumps into bed with Cameron Diaz, what I wouldn't give really. Did I like anything about this movie? Yes there was this overgrown, super-mature, obese kid in the 5th grade called Howard something - I found him really funny every time he went around blackmailing Jason Segel for the sex tapes. There's also a scene with Cameron Diaz in a miniskirt putting on her roller-skates. That would feel super awesome for genuine Cameron Diaz admirers. We all love her!. Had there been any other female playing the lead character instead of Cameron, it wouldn't prick my conscience even once to trash this movie completely. That's how bad it is.",Sex Tape
123,thdudeabides,"It started off well, but went downhill fast",4,7 September 2020,"The premise of this film is actually a good one. It's just a real shame that the poor writing and sometimes unfunny execution let the film down so much. Cameron Diaz suited the role, but Jason Segel I think did not. Honestly I think if you switched Jason Segel and Jack Black in their respective roles, you would have had a funnier movie!
The film starts off really well. With a quite funny 10 minute intro that many can relate to, it was a great setup to the rest of the film. Unfortunately though, what followed was an evenly paced unfunny movie.
The bits that were supposed to be funny just weren't. I think the writers found the script funnier than it was when writing. The execution is what lets it down. There are some scenes that go on for far too long which were not very funny in the first place, which really drags the film on needlessly.
The fact that Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz both acted together in Bad Teacher, another poor film, I think explains a lot about how (not so) good this movie is",Sex Tape
124,nightwing90,Better Avoid It,4,3 November 2014,"""A movie about a movie they don't want you to see"". This is the tag line of Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel starrer Sex Tape. The tag line perfectly suits this film on all counts and correctly sum up the film's fate. Yes, this is one film you don't want to see and even if you have seen it, you would like to erase it from your memories at the earliest. I would put Sex Tape as a ninety minutes boring comedy drama that fails to provide any sort of excitement matching the subject and making it a dragging film.Jay and Annie are happily married for past ten years with two kids. To reignite their sex life and spice up their love life, both of them decide to make a hot sex video of themselves on bed trying out each and every position in The Joy of Sex, an illustrated manual on sex. They did everything once the video is captured but not delete it. To make matters worse for the couples, the next morning their private video goes missing leaving Jay and Annie desperate to find the same or leave it to fate to see their private acts on the Internet. Rest of the film narrate the duo's search for that ""HOT"" property.The story is interesting but it is the screenplay that let down the film to make matters worse. There was scope for fun but that aspect gets wasted here. Fun and comedy on screen doesn't make us laugh or enjoy making the film a disappointing one. The censor board here has also done their part in chopping some exciting scenes as the initial portions looked bumpy with those cuts in between scenes.Coming to performances, Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz tried very hard to come out something special in a sinking ship and the duo could not make any impact. Same thing about rest of the casts. So in summary, its a painful film that looses the steam and make you bored instead of exciting you. Sex Tape, a film that can be skipped if you have any plans to watch it.",Sex Tape

Then, out of the blue, there's a gratuitous sequence where a dog keeps getting knocked out, first with a book then very violently with a treadmill - apparently it falls from a window too but we'd stopped watching by then. I should emphasise that it doesn't die, it revives each time. But since the injury scenes aren't funny the repeated abuse of the animal isn't even ""worth it"".I've seen ""There's Something About Mary"" the hilarity in that dog scene is all centred around the increasingly desperate attempts to revive a dog which was accidentally injured once. The presence of Cameron Diaz appears to have struck a chord with the writer but they've misunderstood the humour and set it up so the dog is injured multiple times.I know this seems preachy and a bit hardcore but the point is this... there are plenty of people in the world with an indifferent attitude to the suffering of animals and anything which serves to lower the bar even further just doesn't help.

However there were TWO things in this movie that completely ruined it for me.Firstly there is a part near the end (Unrelated to the plot) where Jason Segal is singing, it is the most awkward scene in cinema history. I don't know wtf the editors were thinking because they need to remove that ****.Secondly, every 5 minutes there is a big stupid Apple logo shoved onto the screen.

Point being, you don't know what's coming next and anything goes.Diaz is in terrific form. She's sweet, funny, edgy and rocks. I'm not biased because she's a good looking chick, I simply find her likable and humorous in this movie. Jason Segel and her have good chemistry through out. Segel has a gift, this gift is that he's just a funny dude.Rob Lowe is exceptionally funny and should do more and more comedies. Other supporting cast members hit the mark as well. Ellie Kemper is great as is Rob Corddry. Corddry I admit, does constantly play the role of the friend in a growing number of comedies, but that's because he's a humorous dude. Don't go into this movie if you're not ready to chill out and appreciate some bellow the belt humor.

Producer: ""Burn it, we're making Sex Tape!""This movie was made by the same team that made Bad Teacher a few years ago. Throughout 2014 I got the impression that Sony Pictures was more centrally focused on commercialism rather than making a good movie when it comes to filmmaking, this movie goes WAY overboard.The surprising thing is the amount of Apple product placement in this Sony movie, it's like they're just trying to use a movie to steal their market by giving us an example of how not to promote a product.The plot of the movie was unbelievably terrible, five minutes in and I was full of regret, but I had to sit through this garbage. It's about a suburban couple played by Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz whose sex life has lost it's touch. FYI the movie explains these two fell in love because they enjoy sex with each other, really? So when Diaz and Segel's kids are gone, they decide ""Tonight's the Night"" and they are overwhelmingly excited and it makes me sick. Seriously I couldn't believe how excited they were it was totally unrealistic and made me realize no character in this movie feels real.Anyway so they also make a sex video with the IPad, but not before they talk about its features, they do that a lot in this movie. But then afterward the video gets uploaded to everyone else's IPads with no explanation how it happened and they spend the next ninety minutes of the movie trying to get it back, ""yawn"". Then there's some conflict involving blackmail when their friends' son uploads the video onto you-porn. So rather than do the rational thing like contacting the guys at you-porn and asking to take it down, they infiltrate the headquarters to smash the database.To make matters worse the owner played by Jack Black confronts them and tells them if they e-mailed him, he would've taken it down.

They get a lot of mileage out of simple situations, it's held together with the glue of a warm couple, and a believable and relatable premise. The situations and the characters exceed the bounds of possibility, but in a good, slightly over-the-top summer-movie kind of way and the spice of great little touches like Jack Black or the boss with the unusual tastes.

137,MovieGeekReviews,Funny but not flawless,4,4 October 2014,"I did enjoy this movie i found it to be sexy and comedic but it lacked style and originality and seemed like any other new comedies coming out in the cinema. The idea of a sex tape and couples who are married going through struggles seems to be an basis for most comedies like Sex Tape.I found it to be rather boring and lacking of comedy in some parts which could have been the funnies parts of the movie if there was a better story line and more realistic acting. However, some parts acting was well done,for a modern comedy,but is not the best of its time. It had some good actors and funny ideas so i would recommend it however don't go into the movie expecting a masterpiece because you will be disappointed.",Sex Tape
138,jakk54,"Bad to the core (yes, Apple, I am also talking about sponsorship).",2,13 October 2014,"I'm speechless, frankly. I really like Cameron Diaz, she is talented and funny but utterly wasted in this piece of nonsense. Where's the script? Not only a missing script but a film which features two highly implausible, utterly unlikeable and slightly surreal characters. I gave the film two stars because of a genuinely funny central sequence in which Diaz snorts coke, while her husband is trying to avoid a very determined German Shepard - I laughed out loud.And, yes, Apple, while I am a big fan of Apple products, the product placement for the ipad was more than shameless. The marketing pitches saying what a great machine the ipad is were more embarrassing than anything else. Come on, Apple, you're better than that - sure, get some product placement (it's common enough in the industry). But not like this, please!",Sex Tape
139,roiduring,"Promising storyline, bland movie.",5,9 November 2014,"When I first saw the trailer for that movie, I got excited, it seemed really funny and fresh. The movie itself is somewhat of a dud, especially when I was expecting something good. What came out wasn't a horrible movie, but I can't classify it as good either.Rob Lowe is the highlight of this movie, his character is very funny and entertaining. The rest of the film was mostly a disappointment. Promising, fresh storyline that ends up flat in the end.Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie, not very funny nor entertaining, but not quite in the territory as some other modern comedies like ""Don't Mess With The Zohan"", which was unwatchable.",Sex Tape

That alone should be enough to raise some form of suspicion, something that people in this film universe seem to lack, but no... Instead it's a great scene for product placement.""WOW!""

Had a lot of laughs and was well worth the view. I cant understand how people did not enjoy this flick. Diaz and Segel are a great comedy team. There were some stupid laughs and some great laughs, but there were laughs all around. I can see this appealing more to the 30 and 40 something crowd than the teens and 20's. The movie starts off with a raunchy laugh but then grows into more real life situations and laughter befitting actual real problems that normal couples and married people face in their daily lives and sex lives, but puts a comedic twist on a serious situation. Like having to schedule sex for Thursday, or not remembering what your members member looks like, or the last time you saw each other naked. Well done, and enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

It was a pure waste of time. Why to produce something like this? It's already enough movies with no quality. Why to shoot more such mistakes? Pathetic, disappointing, irrational and no humor at all.

Diaz and Segel are very talented, funny people in comic roles. The movie overall had a very cute, however stupid, story line, but the portrayal of that story line goes down hill in a hurry thanks to the direction of the film maker. Ever since Seth Grogan came on the scene, who's mouth spews filth from every direction, Hollywood has been pushing the limits with each new ""comedy"" film. Each director trying to outdo the other in terms of gross humor. There are no secrets left in sex. None. Everything is brought out on the screen and in disgusting dialog that leave little if any to one's imagination. Call me old fashion. Call me an old fart. I just don't see the humor in ""Coc..s..ker and motherf...er over and over throughout the movie. What is the purpose? To see how much they can get away with and still make a boatload of $$$? To push the sensor meter to the limit and get a positive rise out of the audience? To me, this is nothing more than a serious deterioration of what little is left of society's morals. Now, it's all about whatever sells.Seinfeld was hilarious. Will & Grace was hilarious. Comedy like the pink panther series was hilarious. Yet not a word of BS was spoken and folks just laughed their collective asses off. Go figure! One of the funniest comedic films of late was, ""Hall Pass"". The charters were cast perfectly and it was a fun film to watch. Yet it did not resemble Sex Tape in any way, shape or form in language content or visual calamity. I'll be damned if I ever waste another $16. on trash like Sex Tape again. Cameron Diaz I love you, but you can do much better than this.",Sex Tape

But that is the thing we never can go to a comedy to see the plot because the best comedy limit there plot just enough to add clever jokes to keep you in the seat the you paid for. Well guess what this movie fails at every inch of trying to be like the 2010's Date Night with Steve Carell and Tina Fey with them meeting a bunch of colorful characters that you would rather see in a funnier movie. This is one of the worst films of the year because of course it is boring flat and dull but not even that justifies how bad it is. At least at flipping least The Other Woman was kind alive and bright with it being funny because I can see what people like in that movie. But this is just gosh awful with nothing to convince you at least a single point of being funny smart or even enjoyable because the actors don't even give it there comedy all with nothing to do except run this tired plot into the ground that goes no where.Do I like comedies? Heck yea. Good ones. But this is just not it. But people complain that nothing goes on in Neighbors but at least that is a film that is alive and knows what it wants to be with a great team up and execution that makes me dying laughing but this is just one word awful.

There were about 10 minutes of this movie that I can honestly say were funny, but the remaining 84 minutes were just complete and utter agony. The movie takes the concepts of silly and campy to new lows. The movie is laden with deliberate and unintelligent attempts at campy humor, but every attempt falls flat.

The whole film over did the product placement regarding Apple with many scenes showing iPads, iMacs and even Siri. The comedy within this film consisted of cheap jokes and a cheesy sense of humour. The plot of the film got annoying and tedious as the film went on. However, Sex Tape wasn't all bad, with Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal playing the roles of a married couple, were actually very believable and showed real chemistry on screen. On the other hand, the same can't be said about Ellie Kemper and Rob Corddry, who seemed awkward together on screen. Overall, I give this film a 2/10.

151,MrUnimpressed,Do yourself a favour and tape over sex tape,2,24 February 2016,"Torture, that's the word that springs to mind when someone asks me what Sex Tape was like. They shouldn't bother with water boarding in Guantanamo just roll in a TV showing sex tape and within 20min the imprisoned individual will tell you whatever you need to know. CIA if you're reading this, your welcome. Jay (Jason Segal) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) are a happily married couple, however with most couples that are married with children their sex life is lacking, it has fell to the way side in the recent years. So one night they decide to spice things up get drunk and film a sex tape on their I-pad, a 3 hour long sex tape. Jay unconsciously uploads the sex tape via the cloud, which happens to be linked to all the devices he once had in his possession. Those devices include the number of I-pads that the couple gave their friends, family, business acquaintances and even the grey bearded Gandalf looking mailman. For the duration of the movie Jay and Annie scramble around the neighbourhood trying to steal the I-pads back so they can delete the sex tape off the devices before anyone is the wiser. Jason Segal is renowned for his great comedy flicks ever since he entered the scene on Freaks and Geeks in 1999. You can imagine my utter disappointment when I had to endure this torturous flick while waiting for Jason Segal to somehow turn it all around.that moment never came. It was a very awkward performance from both Jason and Cameron with the jokes being very forced and the physical comedy unbelievable and unnatural. They tried to hard and you could see it the whole movie. I wont even touch on the fact that Jason Segals character Jay is supposed to be a tech savvy man that boasts on earlier that he can organise all his music libraries but is incapable of understanding the very simple principle of the cloud and its properties. Cameron Diaz 15 years ago could have distracted the terrible dialogue and plot with her bare naked behind but those days are dead and gone, not even her good body at her age could pull away from the poor acting, plot, and overall abysmal excuse for a comedy. Do yourself a favour and tape over sex tape..why the movies is called sex tape and they take a recording on their I-phone is beyond me. Mr. unimpressed remains extremely unimpressed.",Sex Tape
152,hyperion_dani,Not bad,7,4 October 2014,"Looking at the title and the trailer you can think that is another mediocre movie and relies on sex to sell. But in my opinion this film doesn't fall in this category.Yes, it has some cliché but overall is pretty original. It's doesn't rely to much on sex scenes, although too much non-sexual nudity, and it has some comedy scenes that you don't see in any movie. Like louring an attack dog on a running belt. No, is not about animal cruelty is about what a men can conceive in an attempt to save his life. Also it relies on some contrasts. In a portion of the movie you have two chaotic characters (main protagonists) at a cool and calm bosses (actually she works as independent but you count him as her boss) home. It's hard not to laugh.Sure, after watching it I felt that something was missing. Some aspects appear a little forced, some humor you don't find it all that funny but I don't think this is a 5 (rating) more a 7 or even a 8 since there are some things you don't see in any movie and you might remember it for a while.",Sex Tape

This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, certainly the worst Diaz, Segel or Lowe movie. What a waste of talent! It's not the unjustified profanity that bothered me, not even the nudity, which puts it somewhere on par with low-quality soft porn. It wasn't the blatant and obvious advertising of the company that paid $40mil for the making of this piece of junk. The worst part is that, even after you ignore all of the above, what you're left with is a corny, predictable plot which fails to be funny. The jokes are few and far between, the sex scenes are neither sexy nor funny, and everything else just sucks. It seems like an honest attempt to win the ""Worst Movie Of All Time"" award.

But it really does open a door in all of our minds after yrs of marriage, career and children. After that it was a riot. It borderline a very x rated movie which I refuse to ever watch..but this acting was just too good to be true. Some or most didn't like it oh well you needed to lighten up before watching.

155,haydenstephen,The people involved in this film should be more ashamed of themselves than someone who actually released a sex tape.,2,26 December 2014,"The most interesting thing about this film is the curious, untold mystery around how it got made. Jason Segel's career is an inspirational story of an unattractive actor with very little filmmaking talent; a comedian who struggles with comedy, who has overcome all obstacles to ride the ""nice guy"" card to fame and fortune. Good for you, buddy, good for you. But surely, even you are embarrassed at this attempt to pad out a 15 second premise into 90 minutes of trash. Seldom has a movie ever treated the audience like a bunch of morons like this movie does. When I watch these kinds of train wrecks, I spend the entire film wondering at what stage the filmmakers realise what they're producing - I would have thought it was during the script writing process where Jason Segel reached deep into the trick bag of satire and pulled out the ""man goes looking for something in another man's house and runs into... a dog"" gag. Insert physical comedy where the dog almost gets killed in the process...yuk yuk yuk. Oh wait, character throws a sex toy he finds in a drawer at the dog... Ahaha... So if it's so early in the process in which the turd starts to waft its offensive scent into the nostrils of those involved, how many people are just nodding along as money and time are invested in bringing this turd to life, and ruining 90 minutes of audience's lives? ""We'll throw Rob Corddry & Jack Black into some forgettable roles and they'll hopefully magically inject some humour into a script bereft of enough jokes to fill a trailer..."" As unlikeable Cameron Diaz is in most movies, she's the only one doing an admirable job to pretend she's not piloting the biggest lowest-common-denominator, by-the-numbers, studio sh*t-bird seen since 2009's Couples Retreat. The thing that infuriates me the most about the movie industry is that there will be no repercussions for the people involved in rolling out this steaming pile of sh*t. In any other profession, people who produce this quality would be fired, never to work again and there'd possibly be charges of criminal negligence involved. But variations of this film will continue to be discharged by the same studios & filmmakers at the expense of the credibility of humanity until we stop giving them the benefit of the doubt at the ticket box for the sake of some harmless fun.

156,bildevoo,Why.,2,19 March 2017,"After seeing the Marines United scandal all over the internet, I decided to indulge in this dumpster fire (Currently on Netflix, for any other masochists).Now, I've always liked Jason Segel as an actor. He has his own style of comedy that he's polished over the last ten years, and not to mention he's an adequate screenwriter.That said, I don't know what happened here. It's like some scientist grew this Jason Segel clone from a test tube. Only a skinnier, painfully unfunny version of him. He somehow even manages to stumble over dialogue that he wrote for himself.Making matters worse is the fact that Segel and Diaz have zero chemistry together.I've never really understood Cameron Diaz's fame. Even as a child I noticed she was an awful actress. Checking out her recent work, one will see that she's on a streak of poorly reviewed films. Go big or go home, I guess.Her performance in this is nothing short of embarrassing. Some scenes (the part where Diaz comes up with the sex tape idea, and the part where Segel tells her the video was sent to their friends, in particular) seem so amateur it's astonishing they didn't do more takes.The whole film has a rushed feel to it. Plot holes, characters doing things without any motives whatsoever, and the feature's failure to comprehend the basic functions of the devices themselves. (Technology is a center point to the movie but for whatever reason they make no attempt to structure this component accurately). There are periods in the script where one has to wonder if it was written by a twelve year old boy.There's a line early on that displays this best; ""My **** can see the future, that's why I call it Nostra****mus."" Cameron Diaz is seen fully nude from the back not even two minutes into the film (Spoiler: you're not missing anything) and this happens periodically, like they were trying to reach a quota.The music in this movie if it's not stock music they sure tried. There was a moment where I thought my afghan burner phone was ringing. (THIS IS NOT A JOKE THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED) The lighting in this movie is a mess. Normally I just notice well lit films. If it's nothing special I'll note it as ""Whatever"" but this needs to be talked about. There are scenes where the lighting is so aggressive you feel like you're watching a stage play. Shiny foreheads, overly white light in a dimly lit living room its just a train-wreck.The editing in this film, MY GOD THE EDITING. Every single conversation is littered with a barrage of quick cuts. In between conversations, the shots are stale and flat like everything else.The only interesting thing going on here was the flip flop of it's stance on Apple's products. (The interesting bit is behind the fourth wall. Nothing worthwhile going on inside them) I'm confused as to what side of the fence it wants to be on. One minute the couple is upset about the device automatically sending the sex video to their friends and family, the next minute Segel is praising the physical design like he's in a commercial. One scene has him discarding an iPad out a bedroom window, only to later reclaim it from the ground, exclaiming ""Man the construction of these things is unbelievable."" Another part has him looking at the footage they recorded on the iPad, stating ""It's like the best camera ever."" Of course since Segel was involved in the creative process, it has his signature serious moments dealing with relationships and feelings and all that. (Just being an ass) It worked in Sarah Marshall but it ain't doing the trick here. It's forced and cringe as hell.I don't want to use the word ""redeeming quality"" here because it's impossible to save this heap. But the few laughs this got out of me came from the main couple's married friends. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper (Lou – Hot Tub Time Machine, Erin – The Office, respectably) do their best and actually manage (somewhat) to out-deliver the awkward jokes that Segel and Diaz could not.Oh, the dog slamming into the wall after stepping on the treadmill, and the ensuing guilt from Segel was pretty good.

I figured I'd rent it once it came out and if it's really terrible then we could just do some mystery science theater action over it. I don't really understand why people hated it so much. It was funny and relatable but also a bit off the wall. I enjoyed Jason and Cameron together as well. I think that it's something that you can watch with your significant other if you both enjoy comedies. A lot of reviews compare it to Bad Teacher but I disagree.

170,ddraiman1990,Very disappointing movie...,5,18 July 2014,"We were all there, we all saw that awesome trailer with funny jokes and sexy Cameron Diaz. now, after actually watching the movie, i can tell you that the funny jokes from the trailer were the ONLY funny jokes in the movie. the movie starts out as really witty and funny, and shows there's an actual story and not just a movie about sex - that is a total lie. after about 30 min, you realize that the writer either died or was tired of writing, cause none of the story parts actually finish. if you start telling details about a character and something the character is going through, u expect to actually see something related to that in the storyline, because otherwise, why tell it? the movie is riddled with this kind of moments. i had some laughs and i had some *sigh* moments, but overall - THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR THE THEATER!",Sex Tape
171,fsuinnc-56-354756,Hilarious movie. The entire theater was laughing.,8,18 July 2014,"I saw this with several friends. All of us are between 40 and 50 and all of us either have school age kids or have been through the raising of children. Afterwards we all agreed this was the funniest movie we had seen in a long, long time. (and we go to movies quite frequently.) The concept was funny and it is pretty easy to imagine it happening with today's technology. There were a couple of scenes that were less realistic or believable than others but it's a movie and a comedy at that so go with the flow and enjoy a little slapstick physical comedy. The main characters are likable and make a believable ""average"" couple. There are just a couple of spots that lagged but over all it keeps a good pace and the laughs kept coming right to the end. It isn't for kids or people who don't like cussing but very funny adult themed movie.",Sex Tape
172,captscratchybeard,A five minute sex tape would have been more enjoyable!,1,30 August 2014,"Why did we bother? I'm married with two rug rats and thought this movie would be enjoyable, something we could identify with. This was not the case at all! Within 10 minutes my better half had already worked out what was going to happen and whispered that if you were married to Annie(Diaz) then you'd make more of an effort, kids or no kids! We spent most of the movie spotting flaws in Annie and Jays marriage, when it dawned on us that this movie was purposely so bad it made you want to leave the movies and get an early night if you know what I'm saying! By the end of the movie it was decided that Jay(Segel) had been castrated secretly after the birth of their last child which explains why he is a complete pussy.Avoid if you can, if you cant suggest having sex instead.",Sex Tape
173,mpworld-100-371067,Awful and very offensive movie!,1,6 September 2014,"Waste of money, waste of time watching it in the cinemas. But apart from that, it was so embarrassing and offensive to go to a movie and get frustrated for seeing so many commercial for apple products and for being forced so see unexpected scenes with the hard use of cocaine being snorted by Cameron Diaz herself like she was paid for trying to brain wash people watching the movie with such killing stuff for our society nowadays. If you don't want to feel bad after a movie so please don't watch this one which is not at all funny. I didn't know companies such as apple would get their brand involved in such a negative movie with no sense of what the world really needs. Our world has already a lot of negative things happening killing our kids, teenagers and our society so to come to see the things you are not expecting is not a pleasant idea . Our society needs inspiring movies that could teach who is watching good behaviour and not what this movie sold that was like the use o cocaine was fine and normal, etc. Please World let's wake up and not be brain washed by the Hollywood industry. Apart from that all the vulgar and offensive scenes being played by such big names like Cameron Diaz.... Terrible, Terrible, Terrible! I want my money back! So sorry!",Sex Tape
174,mpnemo,sharing the details,5,11 October 2014,"Making a movie about what just became recently utter truth for celebrities seems just as likely as making a movie about aliens, unless they were pictures or videos of aliens that landed on earth that would be downloadable already.Its not really about the actors, about the photography, they are all professionals. It seems much more that a theme that would have been an issue in a soap is making the big screen.Issue is our privacy, the privy. After Snowden, you all know that all web traffic is recorded for good by the government, luckily they have a much stricter control over who they employ than privately owned companies that you trust your privacy with.However, one should be aware that anything thats leaving the device it was recorded with is likely to be easily accessible.Put it that way: The whole movie shows the complete misconception of the internet, privacy and intimacy. Its seems to be a base for lawsuits, and a rough guidance for any kid to not record such things. Which is nothing new, though.",Sex Tape
175,justme333-130-481158,"If you're not expecting much, its a very good film!",7,11 October 2014,After reading the reviews i really didn't expect much when going to the theaters. At first i wasn't going to go and see it at all but since i'm a fan a Jason Segel i did anyway. In the first few minutes i saw what the reviews have been saying and thought i wasted my time and money after all but just as fast as those thoughts came they went. The movie picks up pretty fast and has tons of surprises which you really wouldn't expect at all. The humor i must say although is the kind of humor you really only get when watching Jason Segel and Rob Corddry and i can only say that i love it! It isn't too clever but the way they present it to you will make you laugh. Guaranteed. I had a few really good laughs and a chuckle here and there which is all i need when watching a comedy.I just don't understand how people can even mention it being the worst movie of the year or stuff like that.All in all its a funny and entertaining movie until the last minute. And although you might think its more of a movie that only married couples would prefer watching to me as a single guy i couldn't want any more!,Sex Tape
176,jimmydodgie,Absolutely Awful Worst Movie Since Battlefield Earth,1,2 November 2014,"How did IMDb give this a 5.1 rating. Rotten Tomatoes has it right with  the 1 rating. It is hard to believe that Carmen Diaz is in this  disaster.  I thought in my lifetime I would never see a movie as bad as cult  follower John Travolta's scientology sci-fi boondoggle Battlefield  Earth but Sex Tapes has matched the mediocrity.  It starts off okay then gets beyond stupid. Carmen or Carmen's double  brief nudity cant' save this. How bad, perhaps Diaz career nosedive is  in stealth mode when in the movie she doing a line of cocaine with  miscast Rob Lowe and that is supposed to be funny.......not....  I was embarrassed watching it. I am embarrassed to say I saw it.  You been warned. It should be zero stars.",Sex Tape
177,c-campeau,Fun watch,7,14 December 2014,"Really, it's not that bad. I have no idea why people are raving about how bad it was. It's like all the other popular comedies out there. It's not meant to be profound. Yes, some of the things meant to make me laugh didn't, but others did. For example, I don't find the scenes with the dog funny, but I love the raunchiness and the premise. Fear the cloud!Also, nice to see a naked DUDE for a change instead of just female nudity!!!!!Why do I need 10 lines? This is silly... why say more than necessary. I think being concise is more appreciated.",Sex Tape
178,hilla-99011,I have never seen a worse movie,1,15 May 2015,"Usually I watch movies to the end. Not this one! I have seen movies that advertise a product, in some part of the movie. This is Apple's advertisement all the way the whole movie.I'm sad to see that this level actors get involved with such a crappy movie! Only good part was when I saw Cameron's naked body. Soon after that I gave up watching it!I'm wondering how much actually Apple paid to get this movie released?You would rather go and have your tooth pulled out in stead of watching this movie!!!! Don't waste your time and money on this!!!",Sex Tape
179,elleshuford,Seriously?,2,3 July 2015,"Come on! Whose dumb idea was it to cast Cameron Diaz for this role? She is WAY too old to be able to pull this off believably! When I first started watching it I was thinking ""okay, this is a 40 something woman back in college with a high sex drive dating some young college guy that can keep up with her."" That would make sense as a believable role for Cameron. I was SHOCKED to discover this was not the case when she is sitting down with her ""parents"" that don't look much older than her, and they are telling her that she is too young to marry this guy?? WTF?!?! After this I tried to adjust my mind set to the reality that Cameron is supposed to be playing a 20 something college girl. However try as hard as I can I just can not force my brain to accept this. she is just TOO old! I can see the time she has experienced in her life in her eyes, facial structure, and her bearing (how she carries herself) no amount of makeup can cover that up. It might have been more believable with an older actor that looked more her age, then your not trying to span a twenty year age gap with makeup and lousy acting. I am pretty easy to please when it comes to films, but this one is just TOO bad of a film for even me.",Sex Tape
180,imontauk,"Hilarious and wonderful film, don't be swayed by other reviews",10,9 September 2015,"Hilarious and fantastic movie. I was shocked, after watching it, to see the awful reviews it received.I was skeptical when I read the title and the concept, even when my cousin recommended it. I don't usually like raunchy comedies, have a very low tolerance for stupidity or slapstick, and overall tend to prefer drama or European comedies over American ones.Sex Tape surprised me. I laughed a lot as it started, and just kept laughing all the way throughout. And then it even had a nice moral at the end.Yes, it's a bit ridiculous, but that's the whole point and it's fun and surprising the whole way. It helps if you can relate to the premise of how hard life gets for couples after they have kids (my friends and sibling are all exhausted all the time from caring for theirs) but other than that, anyone should be able to enjoy this. I've never left a review before on IMDb because usually the overall rating reflects my perception. I logged on to create this one to correct what I think is an inaccurate rating. Watch this movie and enjoy fully!",Sex Tape

182,NickTW,Really funny and the humour transgressed culture and nationality lines,10,11 September 2014,"I was lucky enough to see this film in the wonderful SFX Cinema in downtown Bangkok. Now being a Brit I have a slightly more developed sense of humour than my American Cousins and to be honest I roared with laughter the whole way through. True Cameron had some moments when her facial expressions indicated ""I can't believe I am doing this"" but ever the professional she pulled it off. My vote for funniest actor goes to the German Shepherd dog and the line ""hey Google, how do you perform CPR on a German Shepherd"" followed by a ""google answer"" there are 4 Starbucks near your location, had tears rolling down my cheeks. Funniest of all though was the response from the local Thai audience who hollowing the subtitles on screen seemed to grasp every aspect of the humour and join in with laughter. If this was the sort of film on Cameron's bucket list, then well done you have done it and done it well. All in all an enjoyable movie and despite the title and some nudity it wouldn't, in my opinion, offend anybody.",Sex Tape
