0,MartinHafer,Stick with this one....it does improve as you watch.,8,26 May 2012,"I was not especially impressed with ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" 15-20 minutes into the film. The film seemed rather uninteresting and the story didn't grab me. However, because it was Oscar-nominated, I thought I'd stick with it and I'm glad I did.The film is about a VERY strange 11 year-old boy--so strange that he was really hard to believe. His father was killed in the Twin Towers during 9/11 and he's not coping well with it. In fact, the boy is seriously emotionally disturbed. Now you'd expect him to be depressed, but his problems go FAR beyond that. He's dealing with some serious symptoms of an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder--such that he appears close to losing his mind. The boy develops a strange compulsion that his father is trying to communicate with him from beyond--and he needs to figure out the clues his father left to make sense of EVERYTHING. However, as we all know, 9/11 does NOT make sense nor do other senseless tragedies--and the film is about his obsessive quest for for answers and some sense of control.Aside from not believing the kid's story, I also got caught up thinking that his quest seemed impossible. After all, his mother wouldn't just let him roam about Manhattan like he did. And who was that strange mute man (played by Max Von Sydow) and why did he receive an Oscar nomination for this role? Well there is clearly a good answer for the former--and it all makes sense as the film progresses. As for the latter, I still wonder why he received this nomination. Now Von Sydow is a fine actor--but he said not a single word in this film and he also wasn't in the film all that long--yet he was nominated and was considered a likely winner (though he did not win). Regardless, this film will sneak up on you--it is a fine story and was very well made. Stick with it....",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
1,bkoganbing,Finish the chapter and move on,8,21 August 2015,"Although Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock get their moments in, Hanks via flashback, this film is really about young Thomas Horn and his search to find some meaning in his father's death in the World Trade Center. I have to confess that burying an empty coffin which is what Sandra Bullock does to obtain closure was a bit extreme. A nice memorial service would have done for most people.Young Mr. Horn is a wonder with a distinguished supporting cast supporting him in his movie Extremely Loud&Incredibly Close. We've only seen him in one other film. Has he gone into other pursuits?As father and son Hanks and Horn play beautifully against each other. They have a great relationship mostly because Hanks treats Horn like an adult. They spend a lot of time with each other, it's almost like Bullock is frozen out. It's like summer catch every day with them except these are intellectual games between a smart father who went to MIT but went into the jewelry trade to support a family and a most precocious son.When Hanks is killed in the World Trade Center attack on 9/11 it is young Horn who can't get over it. The rest of the story is how he works out his grief process through the hunt for the lock that a key he finds in a vase that his father purchased and has only the word 'Black' written on the envelope where the key was. The rest of the film is the strange odyssey through the streets of New York and the mathematical precision in the search that Horn works out. He's aided and abetted for a while by Max Von Sydow who got a best support actor nomination playing the catatonic man who Horn realizes is his grandfather. How he figures it out is something to see, but he's one smart and observant kid.Some have asked what the message is. Two messages, fecal matter happens in life without any rhyme or reason to it. Something we all have to recognize. The second is much harder, just that life moves on and when we lose a loved one or anything else bad happens just take it in stride and move on. A harder message to realize for an incredibly bright juvenile who tries to find meaning in it all.Years ago I knew a young adult who really never grew out of his childhood because childhood was denied him. He and his sister were taken from their parents by Child Welfare and raised in a group home. He could never get over that until the day he died of AIDS. All he ever wanted was something that was denied him, a home and family. He never learned to move on the way Thomas Horn has to.Extremely Loud&Incredibly Close also got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture in 2011 but lost to the artist. It's a worthwhile film if for nothing else the wonderful relationship between Tom Hanks and Thomas Horn.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
2,SnoopyStyle,Didn't like the kid before or after the death,4,27 June 2014,"Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks) loves to get his son Oskar (Thomas Horn) to explore. He's bratty and reserved. Then Thomas dies in 9-11. His mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is depressed. Oskar finds a mysterious key with the word Black on the envelope. He goes on a quest to find where the key fits and maybe extend his connection to his lost father.It's an interesting premise even though it uses the often referenced 9-11 as its touchstone. I should like this but I just couldn't connect with it. I have to conclude that I couldn't connect with the bratty kid. He's angry, bitter, and strange. That's before the death of the father. I think it would work better if he was happy and outgoing before the tragedy. Then he could have a compelling change of character. Eventually, his character just tired me out and so did the pervasive melancholy.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
3,Prismark10,The key to understanding,5,9 January 2014,"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is a dilemma. Poignant and touching. Yet at times also poor and difficult to watch.The child lead character, Oskar is smart, socially awkward. He can be rude and abrasive and may have some form of Asperger's.He has a great relationship with his father played by a portly Tom Hanks in the film.The film in essence deals with the aftermath of 9/11 on one family as well as the events of the day itself. Oskar's father died in the Twin Towers.Oskar has a difficult relationship with his mother who he accuses of being absent. In truth she is absent from the screen a lot in this film whilst Oskar embarks on a search for a lock that would open from a key he found in a blue vase in his father's room.This search leads him to cross all over New York as he meets many people called Black.Later on he is accompanied by an elderly man (Max Von Sydow) who moved into his grandmother's flat soon after his father died. This man does not speak instead he communicates via notes.Thomas Horn gives a good performance of a difficult child character who can be spiteful and nasty, especially to his mother.Yet given his various social phobias, you fear about his welfare as he criss crosses NYC meeting strangers.Von Sydow and Hanks, both give touching performances especially as Von Sydow does not say a word.The film is ultimately about closure, understanding and even redemption.I also found it exploitative. Cynically manipulating your emotions regarding the event of 9/11. The story also does not hang together well and Oskar can be hard to root for at times.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
4,kosmasp,"Now, never or sometime",5,3 May 2012,"This movie has created quite some buzz. Negative buzz that is, with many reviews taking the title and twisting it (something along the lines of extremely lame and incredibly boring). But it's an easy target, isn't it? And I have to admit, that I kinda liked the performance by the boy. Plus Mr. Sydow always knows how to play and is a wonderful addition to an otherwise almost aimless picture.While those two really are on top of their game, you wonder what the screenwriters were thinking? Did it really have to have this back-story? Many (including myself) do not think so. Quite the contrary, taking this into account made the movie almost unbearable. If you take the ""solution"" or how the movie resolves, this really seems like a time waster (depsite the performances). One thing is for sure: You do wonder how this movie was nominated for an Oscar, whereas a masterpiece such as Drive got overlooked completely (well except the sound nomination, but you get my point)",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
5,classicsoncall,"""You never know what a key's gonna fit.""",7,1 July 2019,"If one were to judge a movie by the amount of times it brings one to tears, this would unquestionably be a '10'. However there's a definite attempt at manipulation here, and I felt the story's central premise of Oskar Schell's (Thomas Horn) trying to locate the former owner of a key from over six hundred possibilities, and using only his foot power to interview them, stretched all the bounds of credibility the picture might have had. Now you can't fault any of the players for that, as the young actor here performed admirably; getting through that complicated monologue at one point was astonishing. I liked Tom Hanks' limited role as well, effectively conveying the attributes of a dedicated father to help his son reach his full potential as a human being with a limiting Asperger's condition. Set against the backdrop of the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster, the story prompted me to consider just how many families with young kids had to endure the torment of losing loved ones and carry that memory forward for the rest of their lives. The primary message coming out of this story for me was best conveyed by one of the hand written messages left by the elder Thomas Schell/The Renter (Max Von Sydow) for his young ward. Afraid and paranoid of virtually every new obstacle to achieving his goal, Thomas eventually found comfort in the advice that ""Sometimes we have to face our fears"". It's a valuable lesson for everyone, though I would have liked the picture to allow some closure for the elderly man himself. Unlike the hulking Chief Bromden in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", who chose not to speak except for those two words to R.P. McMurphy (""...ahh, Juicyfruit.""), the mysterious renter could have provided an added measure of consolation to his grandson if he had only followed his own advice.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
6,lee_eisenberg,How do we interpret events?,5,17 August 2017,"I'm not quite sure how to review Stephen Daldry's ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"". It focuses on a number of different things at once: 9/11, Asperger's syndrome, and a quest for an answer. I understand that several reviewers found the movie exploitative in how it focused on the first two. I didn't see it that way. I guess that the gist of the movie is that sooner or later, we all must realize that it's a harsh world out there. In the protagonist's case, it took the 21st century's most famous - or infamous - event to make him realize that. As his mother reminds him, we can't always explain why these things happen.* As to the issue of whether the movie deserved its Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, I don't think that I would've nominated it. Of course, I haven't seen as many 2011 releases as I would've liked to, so I don't know what I would've nominated in its place. In the end, Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and the rest turn in fine performances, so that saves the movie more than anything.*There have in fact been countless explanations as to why Osama bin Laden directed his followers to hijack the planes, but it would take too long to discuss here.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
7,jboothmillard,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,5,24 February 2013,"I heard about this film during the awards season, I knew that the subject matter would be one of those kinds of films you would expect to be in the Academy Award, but mixed reviews, most a bit negative, meant that this film was one of the duff choices for Best Picture nomination, from director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours, The Reader). Basically nine year old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) is an obsessive boy, possibly living with Asperger's Syndrome, who has spent the last year with his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) grieving for the death of his father Thomas (Tom Hanks), who was killed during the attacks on the World Trade Centre on September 11th 2001. Through flashbacks we see that Thomas and Oskar were very close, especially in their interest in puzzles and conundrums, playing games involving oxymorons and finding objects around New York City, and since his death the young boy is convinced that somewhere his father has left a final message for him, his father quoted to him many times ""if things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding"". On 9/11 Oskar was let out of school early, he had no idea what was going on until he got home and listened to the five messages on the telephone answering machine, the phone was ringing for a sixth time but the boy was too scared to answer, it went to answer machine and the call stopped when the building was seen on the news collapsing, he never lets anyone hear these messages, replacing the machine. A year later the young boy breaks a vase on top of his father's closet, and inside it is an envelope with a key in it, and Stan the Doorman (John Goodman) spots the name ""Black"" on the envelope, so he becomes obsessed in finding the lock for the key, Walt the Locksmith (Stephen Henderson) tells him it could be for anything. He starts searching out all 472 people from the phone book with the surname Black in New York, each Saturday he searches out at least two Blacks in the day, carrying and shaking a tambourine, hardly ever taking public transport or crossing bridges from fear, walking the many blocks and streets to find their places, meeting each one and asking whether they knew his father, and whether they recognise the key or know what it is for. One day Oskar meets the strange man who has been living with his Grandmother (Zoe Caldwell), he does not talk because of a trauma in his childhood, only communicating with the words ""yes"" and ""no"" on his hands, and writing notes to speak, and he calls himself The Renter (Oscar nominated Max Von Sydow), they become friends as they travel together to the various people named Black, and the boy learns to face his fears. The boy decides to reveal the secret of the answering machine messages to the stranger, he cannot bear to listen much longer and stops him from playing the sixth and final message, the boy is sure that the old man is his grandfather, he writes that he will not help him in his search anymore, and that he should stop searching all together. Oskar kept a newspaper clipping from his father, he notices a circled number, who rings it and it is Abby Black (Viola Davis) who answers, he visited her earlier and she denied knowing anything about his father or the key, but she may know something after all, and takes him to her ex-husband William (Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright). He recognises the key and says that he has been looking for it for a long time, his father died and had a key to a safe deposit box, this key was put inside a vase that was bought by Thomas, and he advertised in the newspaper to try and get the vase back to whoever bought it so he can have the key back, it unlocks a safe deposit box, so Oskar is disappointed the key was not meant for him. When Oskar returns home his mother Linda reveals to him that she knows what he has been up to, because she found his files detailing the locations for all Blacks in the city, and she went to visit all of them before Oskar would meet them, to explain what he was doing and what they should do when he arrives, and he has made a scrapbook for his hunt that he has titled ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close."" The end of the film sees Linda find the book with an animation of a falling man going up instead of down, the stranger, who is his grandfather, returns to his grandmother, and a happy ending for Oskar, when he goes to the swings that he and Thomas went to many times, and underneath the particular one he finds a small message stuck underneath, with writing from his father, and he is happy to get on the seat and start swinging. Also starring Hazelle Goodman as Hazelle Black. Young Horn is a great choice for the obsessive boy who will stop at nothing to reconnect in some way with his dead father, Hanks in his scenes is a good and clever man, Bullock gets enough moments to be suitably emotional and kind, and Von Sydow does indeed almost steal the show as the silent man who can only communicate his thoughts through writing but has a good heart, the supporting cast members you recognise are good choices as well. I have to admit, this film wasn't as boring or schmaltzy as I thought it was going to be, the 9/11 subject matter is used to good effect, the father-son relationship going backwards and forwards in time keeps you engaged, and you are certainly keen to see the conclusion, a little cheesy and slow, but a likable drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year. Worth watching!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
8,moonspinner55,Diary of a Mad Schoolkid,5,14 February 2012,"Precocious, maddeningly inquisitive Manhattan preteen, egged on by his jeweler father/best buddy to be a reconnaissance explorer, finds himself rudderless a year after his dad's demise in the 9/11 disaster--until the accidental discovery of a single key in his father's belongings reawakens the need to explore and find answers...and to keep his father's memory alive. Handsomely-produced drama, adapted from Jonathan Safran Foer's novel by Eric Roth, unfortunately keeps nervous young Thomas Horn in a constant state of paranoia and panic. Horn's Oskar is deeply upset by his father's senseless death, yet his belligerence is alienating to the audience (grieving mom Sandra Bullock can't reach him, and neither can we). Oskar bruises his skin with pinch marks, hides under his bed, and locks himself in the bathroom--that is until Saturday, when he takes it upon himself to storm up to the doorsteps of area residents to ask questions about the curious key (and these people are shown inviting the child in, as if New York City were really just one big daisy chain of lives interlocked by a national tragedy). Horn (who resembles Elijah Wood in his youth) pulls off a handful of difficult scenes with amazing self-assurance, but his mid-movie recap of events (told at top volume via staccato flashbacks and quick cuts to Horn's panicked face) is too much to bear. After this impossible sequence, the film's momentum freezes, congealing into an off-putting boys' adventure tale, one laden with open wounds. ** from ****",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
9,tavm,"After 10 years after it happened, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close addresses the way a certain kid deals with his loss on ""the worst day""",9,30 January 2012,"Just watched this drama with my movie theatre-working friend just now. Though Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are the main attractions, it's Thomas Horn as their son Oskar Schell who's supposed to be the starring protagonist here. He's a kid in New York who experiences what he refers to as ""the worst day"" concerning someone in his family and thinks a key left to him would provide him answers. If you haven't seen the movie or know about the premise, that's all I'll say about it but I have to also say that I don't think the character deserves whatever criticisms I've read so far from some critics like Leonard Maltin. I mean, sure he doesn't seem relatable in a universal way but considering what he goes through, you can't blame him for the way he behaves. And, really, besides the players I've mentioned above, supporting actors like Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, and especially Max von Sydow deserve whatever plaudits come to them. So on that note, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is well worth seeing if you don't mind having to think while watching and my friend would agree with me.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
10,edwagreen,"Incredibly, Extremely Tense **1/2",6,19 June 2012,"We know that the tragedy of September 11, 2001 would bring about thought provoking, tense motion pictures on the subject. After all, we could never view a comedy or musical situation based around this great American tragedy.That being said, Thomas Horn, a child actor with great potential, gives quite a performance as the precocious, intelligent, intense child grieving the loss of father, Tom Hanks, in the World Center tragedy. The problem here is that Horn goes over the top in his delivery and at certain times, he becomes quite annoying to watch.The grandmother comes across as some mysterious character. The key to success in this film would have been to present a child caught up in the tragedy, but not showing the depth of the character.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
11,grantss,How on Earth did this get a Best Picture Oscar nomination?,3,3 March 2016,"How on Earth did this get a Best Picture Oscar nomination? This movie is dull and pointless. While you can understand the emotional background of the movie, the emotion in the movie seems contrived and unrealistic. It all just seems constructed to seem dramatic, when it fact it is mostly quite empty.Probably the most telling drawback to the movie: the kid has to be the most irritating character in the history of cinema. If the boredom doesn't cause you to stop watching, the kid will.Even having Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Max von Sydow, John Goodman and Viola Davis in the cast can't save this.Only purpose of the movie is to show that 2011 was a pretty bad year for movies.

12,Boba_Fett1138,One of the biggest surprises of 2011!,8,8 February 2012,"This seems to be really one of those cases of you'll either love this movie or completely, totally hate it. I personally really wasn't expecting much from this movie and knew very little about it as well but I was completely surprised and wowed by it. It's a really warm, heartfelt movie, filled with both adventure and drama.Things could had so easily turned cheap and sappy in this movie but it really didn't. Instead the movie at all times felt like a real warm and honest one, with some great storytelling in it and no, I'm normally absolutely not a fan of Stephen Daldry's movies and directing approach. What I absolutely loved about this movie is that it's being told almost entirely from the eyes of a child, who has lost his father and is trying to cope with it by going on, what he thinks, is the one last adventure through the city of New York, that his father had planned for him.Really, over the years we have had many adventure movies of course but how many of them successfully combined it with some true heartfelt drama in it as well. On that level this movie is already really an unique and original one, that works on so many different levels.It seems that the only reason why some people have some major problems with this movie and are even offended by it is because its drama involves 9/11 and uses its events to emote its audience. And of course while they have a point about this, I didn't feel at all as if it was using it in a cheap or gimmicky way, to easily get emotions from its audience. The only one thing I will complain about was that it kept referencing a bit too much at it at times. Really, one mention of it could had sufficed but the movie instead kept using some flashbacks at times, which were still powerful but it got done 2 or 3 times too many in my opinion. Besides, there were times I even got confused by it and didn't always intermediately noticed that it was a flashback I was watching.I was absolutely loving all of the characters in this movie and also really liked it that the movie had the guts to portray a little kid as a little kid for a change and not one with some fake emotions, feelings and thoughts. Everybody was a kid once, some much longer ago than others but I do believe everybody should be able to identify in one way or another with its main character, played by the young Thomas Horn, who made his acting debut with this movie. But the same more or less goes for all of the other characters as well, who got very well written and got played by some well known and great actors. This movie probably features both Tom Hanks' and Sandra Bullock's best performance of the past years and Max von Sydow, who never says a word in this movie, even got nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie.Really, this is one of the best 2011 movies I have seen and it also definitely ranks among my favorite ones as well.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
13,george.schmidt,Extremely cloying and incredibly obnoxious; Von Sydow is the only glimmer of humanity here.,7,6 February 2012,"EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE (2011) **1/2 Thomas Horn, Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Max von Sydow, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, Zoe Caldwell. Post-9/11 melodrama is the backdrop for this at-times maddening adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel about an adolescent with borderline-Asperger's syndrome (newcomer Horn) who attempts to cope with his grief in the aftermath of losing his father (Hanks in flashbacks) in the WTC attacks – by embarking on a journey to unravel the mystery of a key he believe will lead to something of significance. Directed with some hamfistedness by the usually adept Stephen Daldry (his use of the 'falling man' imagery of 9/11 is rather infuriating) the film is buoyed equally by the frequently obnoxious protagonist preciousness that makes you want to shake him instead of hugging him in spite of his situation. Von Sydow delivers a memorably mute turn as the possible long-lost grandfather who is the 'tenant' of Horn's grandmother across the way.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
14,ferguson-6,"All I need is this key, oh and my tambourine",5,22 January 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been ten years since the September 11 attack and it's still difficult to talk about, write about, or make a movie about ... and certainly difficult to critique any of those attempts. Since I haven't read the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer (who also wrote Everything is Illuminated), my comments will be related only to this film directed by Stephen Daldry (The Hours, The Reader) and the script by Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button).Two positive things stand out for me in the film. Young Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell is interesting and talented, and someone I enjoyed watching on screen for most of two hours. Approximately 70 years his senior, Max von Sydow is captivating as speechless ""Renter"" from Oskar's grandmother's apartment. The two are quite an entertaining pairing on their road-trip through NYC.The basic story is that Oskar's father Tom Hanks) is one of the victims of the WTC attacks. Through flashbacks we see that he was a world-class father to Oskar, who may very well be inflicted with Asperger's Syndrome. Either way, Oskar is intelligent way beyond his years and possesses quite a curious and analytical mind. When his father dies, Oskar is convinced he can make sense of things by finding the lock that fits a key he found in his father's closet. He assumes it's another puzzle his father laid out for him with the only clue being ""Black"" written on the envelope.While it is interesting to see how Oskar organizes his mission of contacting the 472 Black's noted in the NYC phone book, it seems mostly a writing trick to get this unusual young man mingling with ""normal"" citizens. When he teams with von Sydow, the energy level picks up, but we can still feel the wheels turning on the machinery to create tear-inducing moments. These moments are EVERYWHERE and include Oskar being oblivious to his hurtful ways with his mom (Sandra Bullock).The support work is excellent and includes John Goodman, Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright. Young Mr. Horn is best known for his winning Jeopardy during ""Kid's Week"", so he is obviously real-life smart as well as on screen talented. This story is just too preposterous to take seriously. How many parents would let their 11 year old wander the streets of NYC? What reaction would this kid receive as he confronts people while jingling his tambourine so as to calm his nerves? Just too much melodramatic storybook stretching to make this a story worth telling in regards to the September 11 events. However, if you are need of a few good cries, this one tees it up for you.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
15,gradyharp,'It's never gonna make sense because it doesn't!',9,29 March 2012,"Jonathan Safran Foer's popular novel EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE managed to touch many lives with his subtle depiction of the reaction to the horror of the events of 9/11 by assigning the perception to a bright, Asperger's Syndrome-afflicted young boy named Oskar Schell whose father was one of the inexplicable deaths on that 'worst day'. Eric Roth has done the near impossible task of translating Safran Foer's language and method of storytelling into a film script that for the most part works on every level. As directed with the inordinate sensitivity of Stephen Daldry the impact of not only the book, but also a restoration of the events of that fateful day in the history of this country, are unveiled in a manner that not only makes a long film seem short but also is able to tie together the various characters and incidents of this story on film that provides on of the most sensitive bouquets of the meaning of the Family of Man.Oskar Schell is inhabited by Thomas Horn, a youngster making his first film and his lack of expected sophistication of acting only makes this terrified but determined lad more credible. Tom Hanks is Oskar's beloved jeweler father who leaves voice mails during the collapse of the buildings, messages that Oskar keeps to himself (we find out later why), not even sharing the connect with his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock). Through a series of discoveries Oskar finds a key in an envelope with the single word 'Black' on it and he sets out to find the source of the key and in doing so reconnected with his deceased father. He is joined by the mute Renter (Max von Sydow) who lives next to his Grandma (Zoe Caldwell) and together they comb New York meeting everyone with the name of Black - and in the process we encounter some superb cameos by Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, an uncredited appearance by Eddie Izzard and many more. Oskar's journey finally comes to an end in a most touching way as the truths are revealed.The surprise of this film is the manner in which as much attention is subtly played with the amalgamation of people that comprise New York: children and adults with mental disorders, Jews, African Americans, immigrants of all sorts, fey cross dressers, angry people, kind people - everyone has a story that is equally important as Oskar's pursuit. This technique magnifies the message of Safran Foer's story - that we are all linked by a common bond. This film is an experience. Share it. Grady Harp, March 12",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
16,zetes,"A more complex film than most have seemed to notice (SPOILERS for Hugo, too, in the 5th paragraph))",8,26 February 2012,"From all that I had read about this film - and I had read a lot - I expected it to be one of the worst of the year. So how surprised do you think I was when, by the end of it, I was almost completely won over? I can't say I loved it - it's far too flawed to embrace it fully. But I definitely liked it a lot, was quite engaged by the story and its themes and was genuinely moved. Can I defend my position? Hopefully! There are two main criticisms that this movie has received: 1) it exploits the tragedy of 9/11 and 2) its protagonist, precocious, perhaps autistic Oskar is unlikeable. Personally, I didn't see any exploitation of 9/11. It's a fictional story about a child whose father died in the Twin Towers. A year later, he searchers for meaning in his loss. It's all a metaphor for the country's, and the city of New York itself's, soul searching after the attacks, and it treats the subject respectfully, for the most part. Even when it perhaps goes into very painful details of the event, I think it's believable that this character would obsess over those details. It's hard to watch those moments, but I think, much like the first 9/11 film, United 93, it works to make us confront those uncomfortable emotions.The second complaint is probably the biggest reason people turn away from the film, and it was almost my reason for giving up on it early on. Yes, the character of Oskar is annoying, often despicable and unlikeable. If you don't give up, though, you may realize that the catharsis he experiences at the film's climax is more earned than it would be if he had been a charming, lovable little scamp. The kid may not be likable, but you can understand his attitude and pain, especially when correlated with his presumed disease (Asperger's Syndrome). Yeah, I could have done without the at-times cloying narration (if Daldry could have completely dropped that, he would have had an infinitely better film), and definitely they could have dropped the tambourine, but in the end I felt it mostly worked.I definitely have some problems with Thomas Horn as Oskar. I'm still thinking his performance was a bit too irritating to praise. The rest of the cast is quite good, however. Max von Sydow has received an Oscar nomination for his role as the Renter, a mysterious, dumb (as in ""can't speak"") man who rents a room from Oskar's grandmother. That affectation steps a little into over-the-top quirky at times, but von Sydow is very good, especially in the sequence where Oskar exploits his silence to reveal some of his darker, more painful secrets. My favorite performance in the film belongs to Tom Hanks. You'd love to have this guy as a father. Sandra Bullock is pretty good as Oskar's suffering mother. Her big revelation at the end of the movie, while not 100% believable, is enormously touching. And Viola Davis has at least one big, killer scene as the first person Oskar meets in his quest.The story of this film is nearly identical to that of Hugo. That's weird, because these films don't have especially conventional stories at all (the novel Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close was actually published two years before The Invention of Hugo Cabret). In EL&IC, Oskar finds a key hidden in a vase in his father's closet. He believes that finding the lock that the key fits will get him closer to his father's memory. In Hugo, the protagonist agonizes over making an automaton work, hoping that, in fixing it, he will get closer to his dead father. The funny thing is, while Hugo's definitely the stronger movie, I think EL&IC may have the more complex themes and resolutions. After all, Even the treatment of the side characters, who quietly go by with their lives in the background of the main plot line, is quite similar.So, sure, this film has its problems, with some obstacles that are not easy to clear. But I found it gave me a lot more to think about than plenty of other 2011 films, including Best Picture frontrunner The Artist. I'm not even sure I'd watch it again, except for maybe to see if I wasn't completely wrong about it. But I certainly did like it this first time around.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,8,25 February 2012,"It's now more than a decade since the fateful events of 11 September 2001, and there has already been a number of films that have been set around the day, with stories told being somewhat reflective about the country's emotional state and well being as told through the lens of various filmmakers. Stephen Daldry's Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is perhaps the more matured and measured telling that incredibly encompassed a fair bit of everything extremely horrific involving the Twin Towers collapse without trivializing it, and punches above its weight with its heart-wrenching story.Based upon the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, the film tells of how the loss of a father in quite inexplicable terms is dealt with by his wife and son. Tom Hanks stars in a small supporting role as Thomas Schell, a jeweller who shares a solid connection with his son Oskar (Thomas Horn), who suffers from what would be an unproven case of mild Asperger's Syndrome (or so mentioned in passing by Thomas himself), a boy who's really smart with an unbelievable memory for details, but can fly off the handle when being unable to adequately handle his emotions. The happy family situation with mom Linda (Sandra Bullock) and grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) would be shattered, with the bulk of the story dealing with how Oskar assumes a key belonging to dad that's accidentally found in the house, would probably hold a final message meant for him.So begins a road trip of sorts to hunt down where and what lock the key would actually open, and along the way, like in Karan Johar's My Name is Khan starring Shah Rukh Khan as a man stricken with a similar disease, would meet with various people in his journeys, and the impact his mercurial trip would have on the lives of others, and vice versa, especially since he had struck up a friendship with the mysterious tenant (Max von Sydow) living in his grandmother's home, an elderly gentleman who does not speak a word, and whose identity you would probably have guessed when he appears. And you can count on the number of quirky persons that Oskar encounters in addition to those moved by his account why he's doing what he's doing, some expanded with a proper narrative, while others montaged together, or mentioned only in passing.What made this film work is the excellent performance by Thomas Horn who plays the protagonist Oskar, whose shoulders the entire film sits on. If he was unbelievable in his portrayal, the story wouldn't work, period, and the young actor held his own against the veteran co-stars without being overawed. His Oskar will grow on you as you sympathize with his hurt, which will be amplified as the story moved along given the many secrets and revelations to be made in due course. There were many scenes that called for an dramatic outburst, which Thomas handled really well without the need to go overboard or over melodramatic. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock together made it all vividly believable as a small family unit, although both had really bit roles to play, with Tom Hanks being heard more than being seen through some really harrowing voice messages, and Sandra Bullock being really key to that pivotal closure that tells of any mom's immense love for her child, which got questioned and challenged, that turned out to be one of my favourites scenes amongst many in the movie.But of course Max von Sydow is getting all the attention here with his Oscar nomination for a non-speaking role, since his character doesn't speak for no particular reason and relies on a notepad, if not only to showcase how talented the actor is in being able to emote with a critical communications medium of speech being taken away from him, which he excelled. Before watching his performance I would have thought Christopher Plummer may have already bagged the award, but after doing so I'm not really all that sure now, and it could likely be down to the wire.With a rousing yet moving score by Alexandre Desplat, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close deals with Oskar's guilt and his inability to recognize that emotion, nor being able to handle it with an emotional maturity, after all, he's only a kid despite having a relatively high IQ, has to struggle with his EQ and a condition. What worked wonders is how the film managed to reach out through its characters to those affected by the worst day of their lives as Oskar labelled it, and come to terms with things that happen seemingly in random fashion that offers little closure, of the symbolism of burying an empty box.Some may feel cheated by the lack of a big reveal after the trouble and efforts gone through, but I thought that reflected what life sometimes dishes out to us, that there is almost always a lack of distinct answers, and even if not then there will always be shades of grey rather than distinct black and white. It's the little stories and moments in the film that contributed to its overall emotional weight, before the final arc involving mom that really sealed the deal, and opened up the tear ducts. The film may have gotten polarized responses like Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, but in my books it's one powerful drama that hit all the necessary sweet spots. Highly recommended!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
18,Mr-Fusion,Extremely tasteless,3,5 May 2017,"Despite the cloying sentiment, emotional manipulation and that hateful kid, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" has a good story to tell; one dealing with loss and the struggle to make sense of the senseless. I didn't like watching it, but in the hands of better filmmakers, there's the potential for poignancy.It's the exploitative use of 9/11 that ruins it. And I'm one of those least affected by that day.Hanks could've died any number of ways; plane crash, cancer, you name it. It still would've left an autistic child and his mom as a shattered family. The story's still completely intact; nothing's lost. So the images of a man jumping to his death from the World Trade Center are utterly shameless and (worse) feel awkwardly jammed right into the movie. Especially when staged in ""artful"" slo-mo with that infuriating score.Come on.3/10",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

20,StevePulaski,A live action Caillou for those searching for the right actor,4,21 January 2012,"It would've given me great pleasure to call Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close a superb tear-jerker that comes off as unique, visually intelligent, soft-spoken, and enjoyable. Sadly, it barely gets by with everything it has. This is a mediocre melodrama, filled with artificial sentimentality and poorly structured caricatures, completely defying the whole point and purpose of the film.Let's start with the premise, which in retrospect isn't that bad. A boy named Oskar (Horn), who apparently suffers from some sort of unconfirmed disorder, has had a rough boyhood. From being teased at school, to tormented by personal demons affected by his disease. His father (Hanks) tries to cheer up and excite his son by playing a game they call ""Reconnaissance Mission,"" where he will give him all sorts of clues that he can search for.Oskar winds up losing his father in the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York. His mother (Bullock) is beside herself, why Oskar is searching for the most impossible of answers. In the meantime, while searching through his father's room, he stumbles across a key in an envelope marked ""Black."" Desperate for answers and anticipating its lock holds secrets about his father, he tracks down and visits every person with the last name ""Black"" in New York City.Along the way he befriends a mute, mysterious elderly man played surprisingly very well by Max Von Sydow. For an actor known for his iconic voice talents, he does pretty well with emotionless facial expressions and his presence offers an untold amount of conversations and possibilities with Oskar.The first problem is Oskar himself. Remember that kiddy show Caillou, about the four year old bald kid who would whine, complain, and question everything around him? He has now been adapted into a live action movie. Oskar at times is frustratingly tedious and insufferable beyond belief. His smart tone, selfish remarks, and his endless voiceovers become unforgivable even though we are clearly aware of his disease. I'm not sure it's Thomas Horn's fault or just that the character is so unlikable and cloying in his current form. He is left to carry so much weight of the film on his back that any child actor would've struggled greatly with. Bottom line - making a protagonist, especially a child, with an unknown disease is challenging, but here it is extremely monotonous and incredibly overdone.Emotions are contrived in the film. There are so many parts where the film just wants to make us upset, blue, and tear up. The melancholy feeling works in some parts, but no real tears are shed. Mainly because it is spelled out rather than subtle. When discussing the father's death in one scene, the good ol' ""I wish it was you"" line is dropped, but the line felt a better, more emotional presence in Stand By Me. It was unexpected and unbelievably disheartening, but more important, it was an honest remark. It's used here as an impulse tactic.I think the final nail in the coffin is the film's failure to do its main goal; shed light on characters who have the same last name yet different, more diverse problems. The characters we meet are shown mainly in flashbacks and montages, which defeats the entire purpose of creating the journey in the first place. The end drops a sort of unbelievable twist that we can't necessarily believe unless we would've seen some more visits. If we had been invited to more visits with the characters, the twist would've been more of an ""oh, okay"" moment rather than a ""what?"" The few characters we meet are played by The Help's Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright, involved in scenes far too short and underdeveloped. If you're going to make a film about a character who is visiting many people with the same last name, instead of zipping by those people, why not pause for a bit and stay awhile? Let us learn more about them and see if their problems of losing a loved one could be parallel to our protagonists'.Tom Hanks is great in the few scenes he is in, but for some reason Sandra Bullock, an actress finally doing some of her best work in recent films, gets the biggest caricature of all. She is an empty mother, with no substance or depth usually left looking like a rag-doll and being more forgiving of her son than she ought to be. Why give two amazing actors very small roles in a film? Did the father really need to be played by an actor of Tom Hanks' status? Did it really matter since we hardly saw him? Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a lightweight film, vacant of emotions, but present in its optimism. For that matter it's very uplifting in scenes, but many things lack because of the sour character we are supposed to sympathize with. The main kid didn't have to be a fully functioning clone of other sweet kids in films, but could've been more subtle in his disease. And the father didn't have to be Tom Hanks.

22,DKosty123,Sometimes Fiction is Better In A Book,2,7 May 2012,"Thomas Horn does give a moving performance in this one and Max Von Snydow nearly steals the film. The problem is quite early on you can tell that the screen play adopted from a fictional novel is not adapted well. It becomes quite easy to tell that reality is just not here.The characters in the novel must be better drawn then here. The travels and coincidences are too contrived. Worst of all, Autism and Austism Spectrum are not properly represented by Horn's main character. The film does have touching moments.The trouble is in spite of how busy the main character is in the film, the film tends to drag slowly the last 30 minutes trying to milk the emotion out of the audience. Spoiler- but when Bullocks character is revealed to be someone who was not shown the rest of the movie, it becomes way too contrived and I am sure the book does not approach this like that as then the book would would lose readers too.10 years after 9/11 the movie and the book try to get emotion out of the event. There is no political message here, the movie is too simple and basic to even present that as an option.The movie tries to be great drama but falls well short of the mark.

23,lasttimeisaw,"Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close",6,18 January 2013,"I have finally watched this critic-panning 2011 BEST PICTURE nominee, its Stephen Daldry's fourth feature film after BILLY ELLIOT (2000, 9/10), THE HOURS (2002, 10/10) and THE READER (2008, 7/10), all four films have miraculously procured Academy's BEST PICTURE nominations, while the first three also gained Daldry three BEST DIRECTOR nominations as well, thus although ELIC broke the ground-breaking record for a distinguished feat among all film directors (e.g. the one gets nominations for his or her each and every single films), still it triggered quite an upset when this post 9/11 trauma remedy unexpectedly occupied a spot inside the top echelon one year earlier. At any rate, a director whose first 4 films are all BEST PICTURE nominees, which has already set a milestone in the film history, correct me if I'm wrong. But looking back to the film itself, it is an unusually queasy one to watch, first of all, with such a wayward, smart alec kid undertakes a leading role, it ventures into an anti-crowd- pleasing passage to affront the huddled masses' benevolent expectation, and sorry to say that the cute-looking Thomas Horn's flagrantly histrionic performance does exacerbate the condescending request for sympathy and kindness which he endlessly solicits from everyone around on the grounds that ""my father died in 9/11 so please indulge all my tantrums and swear words"". The film manage to achieve a well-deserved"" extremely irritating, incredibly maudlin"" appraisal which is even worse than THE READER's unapologetic sensationalization of the war and human conscience. The hurdles may already root in Jonathan Safran Foer's source material, it is a high-brow tall story detaches from the masses and tries too hard to conspire a tear-jerking fable as a placebo or solace to a country undergoing an awful tragedy, while if the majority of the Americans cannot buy it, what to be expected by the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the hardware of the film is swell, the slo-mo, close-ups, image superimposition, offbeat sonic ambiance and the exquisite usage of light all justify that there is a superior team behind Daltry. Regarding the miscast contention, leave our young protagonist aside, the rest is fairly well-balanced, Tom Hanks is okay, Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are surefooted, John Goodman is John Goodman, it's a tremendous pleasure to see Zoe Caldwell in a motion picture. Although the reverend Max von Sydow's Oscar nomination can be understandably regarded as a token of a lifetime achievement recognition, but truly his furrowed face excels all the words need to be said (just as the film shows). The only entry in my personal top 10 list from it is Sandra Bullock, steeps in her unfamiliar drama territory, she has certain glorified shots, particularly emits an uncanny maternity strength when confronting the most horrid verbal attack a mother can ever encounter from her own blood (although I was a bit out of the picture when my hunch told me Sandie would not wait to slap the little brat in the consequent act, of course, it never happened, I wish it could, who knows, it could be an off scene trivia).Eventually all the puzzles are solved as we expected, the key finds its lock, the reconnaissance expedition ends with a soppy rite-of-passage epiphany, if one can feel better after watching the film, I may divine that there is a dark side of the id has yet to be awakened.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I think the film makers used 9-11 to bring tears/more emotion but it failed to do so because it didn't work at all and was unnecessary to the plot.As far as the actors: ALL was good. There are no questions about that. Thomas Horn as Oskar was outstanding and because of that I hated Oskar - I find the kid incredibly rude and annoying.

25,sddavis63,Trying To Make Sense Out Of Something That Makes No Sense,6,12 April 2012,"The performances of young Thomas Horn as Oskar and Max von Sydow as ""The Renter"" are in and of themselves reason enough to watch this movie. Horn showed a maturity far beyond his years in this. As Oskar, he's playing the son of a man (Tom Hanks) killed in one of the World Trade Centre towers on 9/11. Oskar is understandably traumatized by the event - frightened of everything all of a sudden, grieving his father, held hostage by phone messages his father left after the planes struck the buildings. As he goes through his father's things many months later, he stumbles upon a hidden key, and believes that if only he can find what the key unlocks, he'll have some answers; some closure. The only clue is the word ""Black"" written on the envelope the key is in, so young Oskar sets out to visit every person in New York City named Black to get answers. You feel for Oskar all the way through this. You feel for him more because, while the movie is a fictional drama, you know 9/11 happened and there must be thousands of traumatized children (and adults) still struggling to come to terms with the how and - especially - the why of their loved one's deaths. Horn captured this feeling brilliantly.Von Sydow played a mysterious character known (at first at least) only as ""The Renter"" - a secluded man who rents an apartment from Oskar's grandmother. He teams up with Oskar on his quest, and finally appeals to him to give up on the search and to move on. Von Sydow's ability to draw me into his character is made more captivating by the fact that the character never speaks. He is - for some reason - voiceless. He also has undergone some trauma; he also has a past that he can't escape from; he, perhaps, also has more questions than answers in his life.This is perhaps the primary point of the movie - trying to make sense of something that makes no sense itself makes no sense. One has to come to terms with the senseless things that happen and allow oneself to move on somehow, or else be trapped by the demons of unanswered and unanswerable questions from the past. Oskar's quest to organize everything in his life into neat and manageable bundles, to make sense of this horrible event and to find some meaning to everything that has happened is inspiring because of the tireless devotion he shows to his mission, but it's also sad (and even pitiful) because you know that he'll never make sense of this. It just happened. There just aren't any answers.Horn and Von Sydow make the movie. I was frankly expecting Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock (who played Oskar's parents) to be more front and centre, but of course the scenes featuring Hanks were basically all flashbacks, and Bullock was really not part of the inner circle in this movie. You catch her pain too, as her character tries to rebuild her life and her relationship with her son, but Bullock doesn't hit home the way Horn and Von Sydow do, primarily because her character just isn't central to the story.The movie as a whole is very heavy. There's little in it (if anything) that could actually be described as uplifting. That, in all honesty, makes it rather difficult to get through. You keep watching because of those two performances, and you really do hope along with Oskar that the mystery of the key gets resolved in a positive way that helps him move forward. But it doesn't. That's OK in a sense. As I said, the point here seems to be that there's no sense to be made of the events of 9/11. Oskar just has to move on. He seems to. There's a wee bit of hope at the end. But it's a really heavy piece of business to get to that point. I thought this movie had a lot of thought-provoking content, but I honestly didn't think that on the whole it was a great movie. An Academy Award nomination surprises me. (6/10)",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
26,Hellmant,Rather shameless in it's ploys to tug at built in emotions and memories!,7,21 February 2012,"'EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Stephen Daldry (director of such previous Oscar bait as 'THE READER', 'THE HOURS' and 'BILLY ELLIOT') tries to tempt the Academy again with this 9/11 tragedy and succeeds (despite dismal reviews and box office). The film tells the story of a nine-year-old boy trying to get over the death of his father, who died in the World Trade Center on September 11th, while attempting to find a lock to match a key he left behind. It was written by Eric Roth (who wrote such other Oscar contenders as 'FORREST GUMP', 'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON' and 'MUNICH') and based on a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. It stars Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and Thomas Horn (debuting in the lead). The movie has pretty decent acting and is technically well made but still rather shameless in it's ploys to tug at built in emotions and memories.Horn makes an impressive acting debut starring as young Oskar Schell, the son of Thomas (Hanks) and Linda Schell (Bullock). Thomas was a jeweler who died during a business meeting at the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001. Thomas used to play scavenger hunt games with Oskar in order to teach him valuable learning experiences so when Oskar finds a mysterious key in his father's old closet he sees it as a chance for one last game. He searches New York City all over for the matching lock to the key, having no idea what he's actually looking for. He questions several strangers and finds help from a mute old man (Max Von Sydow) living with his grandmother (Zoe Caldwell).Horn carries the movie and Hanks gives a nice small performance as the lovable father. The rest of the cast is all adequate and the directing is technically decent but the way the movie uses the 9/11 tragedy to force emotions from the viewer is pretty distasteful. It doesn't create any genuine emotion of it's own but relies on the viewer's previous memories and feelings to work them up. The story is somewhat interesting but not really played out well. Like I said on a technical level the movie works but it's true story and heart falls apart at the seams.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QlrJnwsHOM",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
27,thesar-2,Extremely Long & Incredibly Mediocre,3,5 February 2012,"I heard tears in the crowd, if that's possible, during 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' (3/10 Stars) and believe it, I was ""extremely close"" to weeping myselfif only. IF ONLY, they didn't stage the climax 25 minutes before the end of the film – one of my pet peeves. Granted, this gave me enough time to compose myself before I exited the theatre into the lit movie theatre hallway. But, that's the thing with this movie; it almost felt like they were intentionally trying to get you to cry or care. Eh, I don't go for that. Neither did I go for that kid, Oskar (Thomas Horn.) Before I offend anyone, he may or MAY NOT have Asperger's Syndrome – it's only briefly hinted at in the movie. Since it wasn't a clear case – or at least what the film told me, so I will say, for the most part, this kid was a little prick. Supposedly, we're to see that he touched more lives in NYC following 9/11 than the actual firemen who risked (or gave) their lives and his response to that is: that he doesn't care about the people he inspired, he doesn't want friends and he wants just to find a locked box his (9/11 Victim) father MAY have left for him following his tragic end. I definitely felt more for (the other movie) Oskar in 'Schindler's List' than this little tike who cared way more about himself and his adventure than anyone else, namely his mom he condemned to death. That said, I know he was hurting, I get that, and that's part of the reason I choked up (but not enough for tears), but the things he said and did to people were pretty heartbreaking – and not in a good way. Finally, while the movie was well shot and the performances were good (note: not great), it's far too long, horribly paced and not a movie I would ever want to see again. Just like the newscasts from 9/11. I remember the past, and all those who died, but it's just too hard to see that again.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The main flaw with this movie is that the kid, Oskar, was down right mean and cruel at times. So I didn't care if he got what he was looking for because he was such a brat. He would cuss out the doorman, be rude to his mom, and sneak around. Also, the movie was about 30 minutes too long.The story is Oskar finds a key that he thinks belonged to his dad that died during the 911 tragedy. So he sets out to track down what the key unlocks. His only clue is the word black was on the envelope the key was in and a few clips cut out by his dad. So he tracks down people with the last name Black. His grandmother has a mute as a renter that helps him out some. Then the renter leaves one day, so it was a dumb storyline.

You'll also have to forgive it for its schmaltz and melodrama along the way. On the other hand, there are some nice moments, and the movie's treatment of death, loss, searching for answers when there are none, community, rebuilding, and understanding is touching. Director Stephen Daldry is wise in exercising restraint about the horrors of 9/11, and Thomas Horn and Tom Hanks turn in strong performances. Do fathers like the one Hanks plays actually exist? Perhaps not, but the balance shown with bad fathers in the film may strike a chord with anyone who has conflicting feelings about family members. I loved seeing Max von Sydow at age 82 in his supporting role, and that alone made it worth seeing for me. On the whole, your emotions will either be stirred or you'll find yourself cynical, and I suppose I experienced a bit of both and ended up in the middle.

30,Cineanalyst,Mapped Manipulation,5,10 September 2021,"Tediously cloying to be sure, I have no interest in discussing the 9/11 tear-jerker story of ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" but the plot, and I'm not necessarily talking about its non-linear nature, is quite something--a map, or key, reflexively for how to manipulate an audience with such sentimentality exploiting a real-world catastrophe and the collective trauma thereof. It's almost exactly, to use one of those oxymorons, Machiavellian in construction. Even politically so, as the child protagonist and narrator's anxiety reflects the sort of continual high alert and paranoia that politicians and the media promoted for years after the worst day. Planes, tall buildings, bridges, subways, people all presenting a threat. Rather perversely doing double duty, this anxiety of the boy even promotes more sympathy for the character, in addition to him being a child who lost his father when the Twin Towers collapsed.The boy does just what the filmmakers do. He and his companions take his sob story to the streets, to the public, and into their homes. Of further reflexive abstraction, the people they meet have sob stories of their own. Nested stories and storytellers everywhere. Only a few are wise enough to yell at them to go away and to tear up their subsequent letter.As the movie spectator identifies with the perspective of the camera--we see what it sees--the boy controls the camera within the picture, too, snapping photographs of these nested narratives, some of which includes people who draw their own mise-en-abymes, such as the younger child who draws our protagonist and his camera. There's also the answering-machine sound recordings from the dead father, who taught and may still have left clues for the son on how to go about this craft. Ultimately, everything is put together in a book of the same title as the movie and the book it's adapted from. A book-within-a-book. At one point, the mysterious old ""renter"" asks whether they can't watch a movie instead. No time for that, though, because their mission is to make a movie. The only thing real here is seen on the television, and even that is to later be manipulated by CGI through a window frame.Manipulation is a skill and, indeed, fundamentally part of the illusion of narrative cinema, and there are compassionate and sophisticated ways to do it. See the similarly 9/11-themed ""25th Hour"" (2002), ""Reign Over Me"" (2007), ""Margaret"" (2011), or as rooted in a real son, comedian Pete Davidson, who lost his father that day, ""The King of Staten Island"" (2020), for movies that at least in part are better for those reasons. It's just a shame such artifice is employed here for such crass ends and exploiting the worst day to do it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
31,g-bodyl,Needs a New Lead Actor!,6,10 June 2013,"Stephen Daldry's Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close based of the bestseller with the same name has so much potential but unfortunately, it did not reach it. The lead actor, Thomas Horn, probably played one of the most annoying child I have ever seen in cinema. He was so bad, I practically had to put my fingers in my ear whenever he was on screen. However, the rest of the cast was exemplary. Despite my loathing for the main character, there still were some moving scenes that would make a grown man tear.This film is about the loss of a father and how it emotionally affects a child months and years after the death. In this case, Oskar's father died in the 9/11 attacks and this movie shows Oskar's journey to discover more about his father.With the exception for Thomas Horn, the acting was great. Max Von Sydow has an awards-worthy performance as the guilt-ridden old man who only communicates by notepad. Sandra Bullock does a good job as Oskar's mother and Tom Hanks as Oskar's father.Overall, this could have been a very good film but instead thanks to the awful lead performance, this is the worst film of the 2011 Oscars nominees. It could have still been great but the kid was in nearly every scene. But I loved the premise and any story with a father/son connection is good enough for me. There are some moving scenes that may warrant a tissue or two. I'm disappointed how this could have been great, but all it is merely passable. I rate this film 6/10.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
32,lesleyharris30,"Warm Hearted, yet had More Potential than it Delivered,",6,6 May 2017,"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It is a very sweet, enjoyable adventure that follows a young boy who embarks on a journey after finding a key left by his father, who died in the September 11 attacks. Tom Hanks' scenes are very effective and add great depth to the film, the phone call scene between him and Sandra Bullock is very hard hitting, powerful stuff. It tries to be more than it really is, while it should have simply been handled as a family drama, it strives to me be more. It was clearly written as a much simpler film, but when the studio saw Oscar potential, they made it far more pretentious, making it in to a far less enjoyable experience overall. Oskar is an unlikeable protagonist. He is naive and thinks he is far more clever than he is, which was clearly intended to be his charm, but I the way it was showcased, and how Thomas Horn portrays it, just made him an unpleasant character to follow. While its good, it could have been great. Sweet but pretentious, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama or adventure, just do not go out of your way to see it.

33,Irishchatter,In honor of those who were lost in 9/11,8,5 July 2017,"Although there was no such thing as an actual Thomas Schell who died that day, it really shows the reality of how it shatters peoples lives. With Thomas Horn playing as a boy with high functioning autism, it is a HUGE struggle to get though life even more, especially losing your father in a terror attack. That didn't stop him to look for where that key was belonged to and honestly, people like myself who have this condition are misunderstood of the way we behave towards others.

While this is in no way a bad movie it was much slower then I expected. This was as depressing as I thought but there was something missing to really drive it home. Much like ""In The Land Of Blood & Honey"" it seemed to try to hard to make you feel bad when just the story alone has the power to do that. The one huge bright spot is the acting by the kid playing Oskar, he is in about 95% of the scenes and carries the movie extremely well.

36,851222,A very good movie,9,3 May 2012,"Greetings from Lithuania.When i first i heard about ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" i was really interested in it. I liked other movies from director Stephen Daldry especially ""The Reader"" so i thought it will be another good movie. After it's premiere, i read tons of negative reviews, how this movie stinks, is unrealistic and ""the kid"" is annoying and blah blah blah... and i somehow lost interest in it. But then suddenly it was nominated for a best picture and best supporting actor i thought, well, it shouldn't be that bad. After watching it, I can say with confidence - ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is really good movie and i truly liked it. The acting by a young Thomas Horn was outstanding. Cheer up all haters, not every kid in a movie should dance or sing, some of them can REALLY act. He definitely should have been nominated for a best performance.Overall ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" isn't the best picture of the year, but for me it was incredibly close to it and it's a great character study. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
37,tabuno,A Deeply Compelling and Honest Look At Tragedy and Grief,10,18 January 2019,"21 January 2012. Perhaps the best and honest, hard-hitting look at both mental challenge and grief of any movie. In a bold and perceptive use of autistic spectrum disorder, its use is remarkably appropriate because it allows the dialogue to be straight-forward and frank as well as naturally heightening the logical mind from the emotional mind in which in most any movie would have seemed artificial and contrived. There is also a major character who speaks not a word. The entire mystery adventure that avoids fantasy, but speaks frankly to the human condition, allows the audience to experience wonder and the depths of true emotions as well as the hidden mysteries of the human condition and intimate relationships. Sometimes raw and gritty in its hard to watch depiction of anger and conflict, also contains love and compassion and forgiveness, all without pretense and simple solutions.Other movies that have dealt with the nature of this pain and struggle include Where the Lilies Bloom (1974). Movies such as Seven Pounds (2008) or even Fate is the Hunter (1964), Slip Stream (2007), even American Beauty (2000) focus more on the departed than on the survivors or even as Passengers (2008) in a much more fanciful way than focusing on those who must live with the living struggle. This movie is much more straightforward in its depiction of life than well photographed and presented The Tree of Life (2011). In contrast, Changeling (2008) is more of a crime mystery thriller that has a strong element of the emotions of death and grief. And movies such as the Soloist (2009) or Lars and the Real Girl (2007) don't have the same poignant intimacy of the compelling mother-son dynamics.This movie unlike similar human relational struggling movies like The Pursuit of Happiness (2006) isn't as polished in its scripted structure nor as flights of magical fancy as the more recent, contemporary Hugo (2011). Or even The Descendents (2011) by comparison, this movie excels and aptly seamlessly incorporates a vibrant voice-over that seems relatively useless in The Descendents. Perhaps The Cider House Rules (1999) and The Lovely Bones (2009) reflect the same elements of tone and feeling and Margot at the Wedding (2007) captures the same authentic emotional and gripping moments. Another film and emotes such powerful feelings and intra-psychic reflection can be found in He Was a Quiet Man (2007). Sandra's previous endeavor also evokes similar compelling scenes found in Premonition (2007). This movie follows in the recent footsteps of another recent and powerful movie about grief starring Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart in Rabbit Hole (2010) and even proceeds to excel and flow over the flaws in that movie to become one the best presentation of a movie on death and grief and autistic tendencies.The reveal by the end isn't even suggested and the audience is wonderful led door a truly side door which by the end of the movie is led through a door of remarkable human compassion that is among the most unrivaled. Perhaps the only glaringly or jarring, but small weakness was Oskar Schell's personality in the first few scenes seems to be awkwardly set up. Nevertheless, this superb presentation presents a much needed human look into some of the most important elements of being alive even as some of us die.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
38,zkonedog,A Boy's Love For His Father,8,7 March 2017,"If you go to the cinema looking for pulse-pounding action and over-the-top antics, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" can be crossed off your ""to watch"" list. However, if you are entranced by emotions, adventure, and character development, this film will likely suck you in and not let go until the credits roll.For a basic plot summary, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" begins by showing the extraordinary loving relationship between Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) and his father Thomas (Tom Hanks). When Thomas is killed during the 9/11 attacks in New York City, little Oskar is devastated. In trying to re-connect with the presence of his father, Oskar finds a strange key in his father's closet and sets out on a quest to find out its meaning. Along the way, Oskar meets up with an older gentleman (played by Max von Sydow) who helps him along.The remarkable aspect of this film is how it sets up such an emotional bond between father and son in a matter of minutes. When Thomas is killed, you will feel a crushing sense of loss and as such root even harder for young Oskar to see through his epic quest. Even when the primary narrative may wane from time to time, the young boy's incredible love for his father will be what keeps you on the edge of your seat.The characters are also very well-acted in this movie. Horn carries the film in practically every scene, while Hanks is well, Hanks for the short time he is on screen. Sydow picks up a key role roughly half way through the movie, while Sandra Bullock (""Mom"" Schell) plays the grieving widower with great passion.This is a very down-to-earth film, as well. Nothing is over-the-top or overly dramatic. Without giving away any spoilers, I can say that the ending of the film may not initially gratify you, but once pondered upon will reveal itself as the right kind of conclusion for such a real-world effort.Overall, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is likely to, at the very least, find you rooting on young Oskar Schell as step by step he gets closer to re-discovering his father. The experience will make you both think and feel long after the lights come up.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The story behind the movie is good, not so much for the story itself, but the strong emotions that provokes. That, in addition with the great performances, made me give the movie a 5 out of 10. Finally, Sandra Bullock was likable. And the kid, Thomas Horn, was incredible. Now, the problem with the movie was the continuous back and forth of the story line. At the beginning, it was okay, in the middle it got complicated and in the end, boring. The ending was good though. I was afraid it was going to be something clisse, but fortunately it was very original and I didn't see it coming, really.

40,howard.schumann,"Contrived, manipulative, and shallow",6,29 January 2012,"We need to talk about Oskar. Oskar is not your average 11-year-old. On screen every minute of Stephen Daldry's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, he is a highly intelligent but isolated, hyperactive, 11-year-old motor-mouth who has been tested for Asperger's Syndrome with inconclusive results. Surprisingly nominated for an ""Oskar"" for Best Picture, the screenplay by Eric Roth based on a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer unnecessarily brings the trauma of 9/11 front and center for grieving families of the tragedy to relive. Although newcomer Thomas Horn does an outstanding job of portraying the insufferable young boy, his non-stop chatter about irrelevancies becomes excessively irritating after about ten minutes of the film.Oskar's heart is broken when his larger than life dad Thomas (Tom Hanks) is one of the victims of the World Trade Center collapse on 9/11 after being hit by two jetliners in a terrorist attack. The early part of the film shows the close relationship Oskar had with his father, playing verbal games and engaging in so-called ""reconnaissance expeditions"" where they attempt to find indicators showing that there was once a Sixth Borough of New York. Oskar's mother (Sandra Bullock), however is distant and not a central part of the boy's emotional spectrum. On ""the worst day,"" his dad is trapped attending a meeting on the 105th floor of the Trade Center when the planes hit.Though Thomas makes six calls to his family, they go unanswered. Oskar continuously replays the tapes but withholds their knowledge from his mother who is left to suffer without knowing her husband's fate, and whom he later tells that he wishes that she had died in the attacks instead of his father. The main part of the story unfolds when Oskar discovers a small envelope in his father's closet that contains a key. The name Black is written on the envelope and the boy, encouraged by a newspaper clipping with the words ""never stop looking"" circled, incongruously sets out to interview the 472 ""Blacks"" listed in the phone book in hopes that finding the lock that the key fits will bring a message from his father.Fearful of public transportation, Oskar does a lot of walking always accompanied by a tambourine which provides some relief from his anxiety. Not only is this trek dangerous for a boy that young to be wandering the streets in all sections of the city, it is also logistically impossible for it to be accomplished given the movie's time frame. A later revelation of his mother's involvement in the quest is even more unbelievable. Generally uncharacteristic of New Yorkers, most people he visits treat him with loving kindness, especially a young woman (Viola Davis) who gives Oskar special encouragement even in the middle of her husband (Jeffrey Wright) walking out on her.The most genuine part of the film is Oskar's interaction with the mysterious man, (82-year-old Max von Sydow) known only as ""The Renter,"" who is renting a room from Oskar's grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) who lives across the street. The old man cannot talk as a result of a traumatic experience but communicates with Oskar by writing notes on a pad of paper and by the ""yes"" and ""no"" that he has inscribed on the palm of his hands. Their relationship is gimmicky but about the only connection in the film that doesn't feel artificial.In other hands, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close might have been an emotionally resonant experience of devastating loss and the quest for completion. In spite of some excellent performances, however, Daldry never comes to grips with the potential of the material, instead offering a contrived, manipulative, and shallow exercise that does little more than grate on the nerves. In searching for answers, Oskar's mother shouts the superficial nostrum that ""it doesn't make any sense."" The same can be said of the film.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
41,TheMovieDiorama,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is a powerfully raw emotional journey.,9,11 March 2018,"Nominated for Best Picture back in 2011 which garnered some hate, with many considering that it should've been omitted. I can say with the utmost of confidence, I infinitely disagree to the nth degree and I've calculated that the percentage of those unfair critics were wrong. A young boy with traces of Asperger's syndrome stumbles across a key that his father hid away before his death during the 9/11 attack. We join him on a journey of self discovery as he tries so desperately hard to find what it unlocks. This is without a doubt one of my favourite dramas. It leaves me breathless after every viewing, beneath my lifeless exterior I become an emotional wreck. A narrative rich with character, emotion and sweetness that it'll have you smiling, laughing and tearing up. It's a simple story about closure, a boy wanting the seemingly impossible unanswered questions answered. With this, we experience a tale of people, grief and loss. To illustrate the importance of everyone having their own story and sharing them felt refreshing to watch. Overcoming fears, family relationships and the tragedy of a terrorist attack were also included. Yet the plot never felt overstuffed, each element was dealt with such love and tenderness that they intrinsically linked together to create a relatable story. The 9/11 attack never felt exploited, it was a means to project melodrama and how the characters dealt with their emotions differently. To then include Asperger's Syndrome allowed our main character to have a different perspective to the tragedy. He didn't immediately cry or visibly show grief, instead he kept it in his intricate mind which established a difficult relationship with his mother. His unpredictable and distraught behaviour enabled moments of conflict with other individuals which heightens the emotional investment to the story. The acting was magnificent (particularly Horn and Von Sydow), the score was touching, perfectly paced...my appreciation for this drama knows no bounds.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Although so full of raw emotion, it's hard to feel it",5,14 May 2012,"Grief is a process. Psychology books and personal experience will tell you that. Perhaps not all of us experience someone being ripped from our lives in an instant, but the process is always the same. Why then, is it so challenging to watch 9-year-old Oskar (Thomas Horn), whose father (Tom Hanks) dies in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, endure this all-too-familiar pain? It should be moving to see a young albeit peculiar child come to terms with this in his own way.""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" attempts to play powerful cinematic music with extremely sensitive strings. The story is steeped in trauma and mourning, so the obvious danger would likely be creating a film that's too heavy or suffocating, but this story has moments of quirk, sincerity and even adventure. The trouble is that not until the end does the film ever let go of what Oskar calls ""the Worst Day""—his code for 9/11. It haunts the entire movie, and while that can certainly be justified, it throws us out of sync with the characters, who all seem to experience the fiercest of emotions when we aren't ready for them.The biggest problem is Oskar. It has nothing to do with the young Horn's performance, but everything to do with how Oscar winner Eric Roth was forced to adapt him for the screen. I have not read Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, but my guess is given the abundant use of narration in the movie, Oskar tells the story in the first person. Considering we are forced to follow and identify with a 9-year-old with Asperger's and probably some form of autism, understanding and relating to this character is crucial, yet maddeningly difficult.Understandably through no fault of his own, Oskar treats his mother (Sandra Bullock) poorly, swears at his apartment building doorman (John Goodman), throws temper tantrums, lies and despite his curiosity and adventurous spirit, uses deduction in place of logic. He's a nightmare of a main character, and his constant relapses as the film flashes back to 9/11 butt in every time you start to warm up to him.Director Stephen Daldry has experience working with troubled boys (""Billy Elliot""), but he doesn't appear to do enough to help us sympathize, which could be the result of roadblocks in the script. Given that Oskar holds secrets even from the audience until close to the end, most of which deal with revisiting 9/11, it's hard to feel bad for him. He's just a strange kid afraid to move on, which isn't exactly revelatory.Oskar's pursuit of finding what a mysterious key found in his father's closet belongs to is supposed to be the start of an adventure, but one that never really blossoms. The closest it ever gets is the 30 minutes in which Oskar befriends The Renter (Max von Sydow), an old man choosing to be mute that lives with Oskar's grandmother in a nearby building. He accompanies Oskar on his journey and challenges him to overcome his fears, and makes for an interesting compliment to the ever-gabbing child. If you had to nominate ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" for an Academy Award, it would be for von Sydow, so in that sense perhaps he deserves recognition.All the colorful characters you would expect Oskar to meet as he tries to find every single person with the last name Black living in New York City exist in voice-over snippets. From a quick outside glance, the story would likely be about a child going on an adventure expecting to find a meaningful answer and learning that the journey was the entire point, but it somehow ends up way more convoluted.""Extremely Loud's"" Best Picture nomination is extremely unwarranted. Despite the talent on and behind the camera, the product as a whole is messy and most importantly, unable to connect emotionally with its audience. Certainly some people will connect with a moment or two and really appreciate the film's emotional fearlessness, but anyone versed in Oscar- caliber drama knows this doesn't fit the bill despite all the venerated talent that put this movie on Oscar radars everywhere when it first came together.Maybe it's that abundant talent that makes the film's shortcomings all the more difficult to bear, but the more you think about it, the more you realize this kind of a perspective on September 11 — from the eyes of such a challenging protagonist — probably doomed it from the start. The craftsmanship, the acting and some of the raw moments in the story make the film nothing to scoff at, but the impact of it all, which is the heart of this kind of drama, doesn't come across as it should.~Steven CThanks for reading!

43,robert-temple-1,Extremely harrowing and incredibly moving,10,4 May 2012,"This is an amazing achievement by British director Stephen Daldry, who dazzled everyone with BILLY ELLIOT and THE HOURS. The main character in the film is a young boy, played with enormous flair and brilliance by first time actor Thomas Horn (chosen from 3000 children for the part). Because the director does not come from a culture which tolerates the artificially forced botanical monstrosities which emerge from the American Greenhouse of Spoilt Brats, the film never for a minute falls into the mawkish sentimentality which would have ruined it. Horn is never 'cute', he is always earnest, anguished, and tormented. We don't have any 'aw, how cute' moments. There is never a scene when some mother can sigh: 'Isn't he just a darling?' Also, the boy does not mumble and do baby-talk, he actually speaks coherently. Big change for a modern American movie with a kid in it! This film is so intensely emotional and heart-wrenching (without ever descending into bathos) that anyone will need plenty of Kleenex (Sorry, am I guilty of product placement by saying that? The Kleenex Corporation can send my cheque to my favourite charity, IMDb.) The film deals in the most tasteful manner possible with the aftermath of the destruction of the Twin Towers, which people insist on calling '9/11', a usage which I do not like any more than I like '24/7'. If people must talk in numbers, why bother to learn to speak? The boy's father died in that tragedy. We see many delightful flashbacks where the father, wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, has a close and warm relationship with his son, who adores him. Sandra Bullock plays the grieving mother and does not have much opportunity to act, as her part is very much in the background of the story, though she does very well of course. The other spectacular performance in the film is by Max von Sydow, as the ravaged and psychologically damaged grandfather of the boy, who survived the bombing of Dresden as a child but saw his parents blown up in front of his eyes, thus depriving him of the power of speech. He communicates with the boy, who has similarly lost a parent in a blast of course, by writing notes on a pad. He also has YES on the palm of one hand and NO on the other, and flashes them in answer to questions. Because the film is so brilliantly directed, written, and acted, and everything is done with such impeccable taste, it is a truly devastating emotional experience. It goes way beyond providing Aristotle's 'emotional catharsis' and provides 'shock and awe' as well. We do not see any film of the disaster, and it is referred to by the boy in his own terminology as 'the Worst Day'. This story is based on a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, writer also of EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED (filmed in 2005) and several TV series, which may well have its origins in a real life situation. Certainly some of the details of the story appear to be drawn from real stories, as it is difficult to believe that the writer could imagine all of them. The amazing boy actor seems to be very intellectually brilliant in person, not just in the character he plays. He has a Croatian mother and speaks fluent Croatian, and also apparently 'knows Mandarin and Spanish'. His piercing intellectual qualities and superior intelligence bordering on or perhaps amounting to genius are brought out in full by Daldry in the film, and this works so well because it is all real and not simulated. It is rare when a film can get a genius to play a genius. Why not try it with adults some time? Or have the adult geniuses all died? As I look around, there seem to be so few left. I guess there is still Roger Penrose. Certainly in the acting world we not only have Meryl Streep, there is now Michelle Williams. This film is an immensely powerful emotional experience, although it is so harrowing at times that sensitive folk may crumble. However, it is also a lesson in personal determination. The boy's story is so extraordinary, his pursuit of the lock that fits his father's mysterious key is such a lesson to all who might be tempted to give up in their difficult tasks in life, that it becomes a morality tale. Thus, this film commencing with catastrophe and loss becomes a film about moral fibre, courage, and resilience. And above all it tells us: never give up.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
44,Turfseer,Unlikeable special needs child's demeanor spoils tale of 9/11 family tragedy,4,23 October 2021,"This film brings up a basic question about 9/11-should we be dredging up memories of perhaps the worst day in American history at all? For me the answer is affirmative. 9/11 was more than just a reminder that we were ""caught with our pants down"" and always need to be more vigilant in the future about our security as a nation. There is a deeper spiritual significance here however, to what President Bush termed a ""national tragedy.""And indeed tragedy, no matter how painful, has an extremely positive function for the human psyche. It reminds us how close to death we all are at any time and awaken in us deep emotional feelings. It was not unimaginable for any of us to see ourselves trapped in one of the burning towers as Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks) did in the film. The awakening of these feelings indeed brings about a catharsis, a painful internal cleansing, which most of us would prefer not to experience given what is perceived as something quite unpleasant.In this regard, the film is successful. The recreation of that fateful day is fraught with verisimilitude. Notice there is no focus on the people trapped in the buildings. Rather it's the effect of the disaster had on ordinary people and the subtle way in which they reacted to the escalating calamity. One particularly effective example is the use of the recordings that the father leaves on the answering machine. So it's these recreations that can be viewed as actually somewhat cathartic.Nonetheless the film failed for a number of reasons. Perhaps the primary reason is the depiction of the Special Needs child Oskar (Thomas Horn) who either suffers from Asperger's Syndrome or a disorder on the Autistic Spectrum. Many filmgoers found the character to be so cringeworthy that some walked out of the theater or turned off their TV set.Yes I got it when the character was presented as precocious, intellectually way ahead of his chronological age. But I still had a hard time accepting the idea that a nine year old child would go out and buy the exact same model of the answering machine inside the home and then replace it with the new one to prevent his mother from hearing the messages the father left for her and the child as well on 9/11. That a kid (even with special needs) would do such a thing is a pivotal off-putting moment in the film and the source of what turned many off about it.Then there is the bizarre scheme that Oskar develops to locate the owner of the key hidden inside of a vase found in the father's closet. That he culls all people named Blake in the Manhattan phone book and sets out to contact all of them in person seems ludicrous enough (why not just make phone calls?). And then it appears that his mother never seems to keep track of him until it's later revealed she discovered his scheme early on--then permitted him to travel by himself all over the city but vetting all the potential contacts herself beforehand.It's during the period where Oskar befriends his grandmother's mute renter (Max von Sydow) and meets with all these people named Blake that many viewers became turned off by the child's insufferable, rude demeanor. Yes again I get it that he was acting out his grief over his father's senseless death and he couldn't control himself because of whatever he was suffering from, but wasn't there a little more subtle way of showing that?If there was perhaps some judicious editing that could have lapped off a good 20 to 30 minutes of depicting the boy's ""quest"" along with his pointless relationship to the Renter (who may or may not have been his grandfather), then the payoff when he finds who the owner of the key is, would have been a bit more palatable.I wasn't really bothered by the fact that the key had nothing to do with the father except that he had purchased it at a tag sale from the owner William Blake (Jeffrey Wright). The point was that the key symbolized the lost father for both William and Oskar. It also was the impetus for Oskar's subsequent tantrum following his disappointment when he learned there was no connection between the key and his dad.Oskar finally experiences the catharsis he needs (albeit not exactly true to life) and in effect is now able to mourn the loss of his father. He also re-establishes contact with his mother but it's not enough for us to forget just how unpleasant he was before finding the key. Again screenwriter Eric Roth needed to do a much better job making Oskar more likeable despite his disabilities.Sandra Bullock is believable in the limited role of Linda Schell, depicting the emotional devastation she experienced at the loss of her husband. The fairy tale ending where suddenly her special needs child can express his love for her is what you would expect from a Hollywood film such as this. Same for the sudden reconciliation of Abby Black (Viola Davis) and husband William who were on the outs earlier in the narrative.In the end, I didn't buy what Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was offering.

45,BeneCumb,What a peculiar movie... I feel ambivalent,7,26 December 2012,"Although the main character is a young boy, it is not a children movie, and cannot be recommended to all families either... This boy has teenage emotions and adult attitudes, and most of his deeds or conceptions cannot be considered as examples for ""normal"" families. And how to distinct stubbornness from persistence? The plot - having a tragic/sad background - is rather uneven and some unrealistic moments (e.g. mother's assistance in searching), with trivial pre-ending and expected ending. However, the movie contains 2 excellent (Thomas Horn and Max von Sydow) and at least 4 great performances (Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, John Goodman, Viola Davis). Thanks to them, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is pleasant to watch, but I am unable to explain why I had a kind of internal discontent when the credits appeared... Perhaps too vast scrutinizing with general human topics? Still, this movie is for you if you search something different.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
46,meeza,Might be extremely overrated for a Best Picture Oscar but its not incredibly close to being a pure failure of a movie!,8,29 January 2012,"Many critics have been extremely loud in scrutinizing Director Stephen Daldry's weeping drama ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" for its over-dramatic tone and for its disturbing 9/11 images. I am not incredibly close to being a movie critic, but to a certain extent I have to agree with their viewpoints. The film was just nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and that angered many movie buffs who were extremely loud and incredibly mad that some of their favorite movies were snubbed for ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"". I also have to agree with their viewpoints to a certain extent. Not to say, that this movie was an epic disaster. The movie stars child actor Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell, a cerebral and emotional child whose grieving the loss of his father Thomas who died in 9/11 in one of the towers. After his father's passing, Oskar has problems connecting with his grieving but supporting mother Linda. A year after the tragedy, Oskar finds a mysterious key in his late father's closet that might hold a secret message from his father if he is able to find the key's matching lock. The mini-envelope that stores the key has the name Black written on it. Oskar then goes on a wild goose chase all over the five boroughs of New York to meet all the NY residents with the last name of Black so he can unlock his father's message. It would take Oskar three years to meet all the Blacks in New York. I wonder if he blacklisted Jack Black? To help Oskar on his journey with his list, he gets in spiritual contact with the maestro of Oskar lists- the one and only Oskar Schindler. OK, I am messing around; but that would have been cool. Anyways, Oskar does meet a mysterious mute old man just known as The Renter who does help Oskar in his Blacklock campaign. I have mixed results with Daldry's direction of the picture; sure he does provide some unexpected occurrences throughout the narrative, but at times he just gets carried away with the 9/11 imagery. I certainly do not recommend this movie for anyone who lost a loved one in the 9/11 tragedy. Eric Roth's melancholy-toned screenplay was touching but at times unauthentic. Young Horn's performance was very commendable, and I think more studios will be tooting their horn for Thomas' acting services in future films. Tom Hanks' work as father Thomas was solid, but I felt more could have been done with Hanks' talent in the role. Sandra Bullock continues her streak as a top notch actress with her strong performance as mother Linda. But the max performance of ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" was extremely mute but incredibly posed for an Oscar nomination, which it did receive one; that would be the touching performance of legendary actor Max Von Sydow as the Renter. You should rent this movie just for his performance alone! ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" was incredibly close for me to give it just an ""average"" rating, but due to the Max factor I decided to upgrade it to a marginal ""good"" rating. OK, I am done. My extremely punned and incredibly cheesy review of this movie is over. **** Good",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
47,drqshadow-reviews,"A Spirited, Soulful Search for Closure and Life Beyond Loss",8,4 December 2014,"Not what you might expect from a 9/11 rumination piece. Somehow it manages to come off as both intensely personal and strangely universal. Superstars Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock share the top billing, but their screen time is quite narrow and limited in favor of a stiff, appropriately awkward pre-teen, who struggles for years to find a deeper meaning behind his father's sudden demise inside the towers. In that role, Thomas Horn (in his first-ever dramatic appearance) is cloudy, conflicted and heart-wrenchingly real. Prone to fits of sudden anger and misdirected violence, he never seems selfish or misguided in doing so - a tricky feat for such an inexperienced actor. This is a film about trying to piece together a shattered vase without the benefit of adhesive. It's about survivor's guilt, the emotional distance and self-doubt of adolescence and the profound emptiness of a meaningful loss, but while it's often deep, dark and somber, that sense never threatens to engulf us. The boy's father had a light-hearted zest for life that pulses well beyond his own mortality, and his playful spirit lends color and passion to what could have otherwise (quite easily) become an emotional drag. A spirited, hearty journey that bears a loud spectrum of emotions, and stops just short of exploiting the national tragedy it revolves around.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
48,estebangonzalez10,A very emotional and powerful film,8,23 February 2012,"¨If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding. ¨ This is Stephen Daldry's fourth Oscar nominated film for Best Picture after his work in Billy Elliot, The Hours, and The Reader. Many critics seemed to have disliked this movie, and perhaps it may have to do with the fact that it didn't measure up to some of his previous films. I however found Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close a very powerful and emotional film. It was hard not to get emotionally involved with this film that deals with the 9/11 attacks, although mainly targeted on how it affected one particular kid. Just like the kid in the movie, I found myself recalling these events of the past and trying to figure out what I was doing at the time of the attacks. I personally didn't lose a loved one in the attacks so I don't know how this movie could affect those who did, but I think Daldry has paid them a decent tribute. The screenplay was adapted by Eric Roth (who has a great trajectory in writing for films such as Forrest Gump, Munich, The Insider, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) from Jonathan Safran Foer's novel of the same name. I don't understand why so many critics hated this movie since it is much better than most films released in 2012, although I wouldn't have nominated it for Best Picture either. Perhaps critics aren't ready for a 9/11 film yet, or they thought it was too emotionally involving, but I don't see how you can make one dealing with this subject that isn't emotional. The other issue they might've had was that this film centers entirely on the performance of Thomas Horn, the Jeopardy winner during Kids Week who never starred in a film before this. I thought it was a good performance, although it did have its up and downs.The main protagonist of the film is Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who is not your ordinary kid. He is very smart, but not very social, and there is something about him that you know isn't what we would consider normal behavior. He loves however playing expedition games with his father Thomas (Tom Hanks) who is always teaching him interesting facts and sending him on new quests. Thomas told Oskar that in New York there used to be a sixth burrow, but it has disappeared although the clues of its whereabouts are hidden are around Central Park. All he has to do is continue searching. Thomas sends his son on all these expeditions because he wants him to interact with other people. Oskar's mom is Linda (Sandra Bullock) who doesn't seem to connect with him in the same way that his father does. She is however a loving and caring mother who has an excellent relationship with Thomas. On September 11th their lives will change forever when Thomas is killed in one of the World Trade Center towers. We know Thomas dies from the very beginning because the story is non-linear as most of the scenes between Oskar and his father come from the boy's memory. It's been a year since the ¨terrible day¨ and Oskar is afraid of losing his connection with his father. He's in desperate need of a new expedition and he finds one when he discovers a mysterious key inside a blue vase with the name Black on the envelope and a newspaper cutting with the words ¨not stop looking.¨ Oskar believes this is another quest from his father and is set to find what the key unlocks with the help of a speechless renter (played by Max von Sydow) from his grandma's home. They embark on the journey together and try to discover the impossible.I think the main idea of the film revolves around the fact of trying to make sense of these terrible things that have happened and learning how to deal with them. During one point of the movie, Horn's character tells us that if the Sun were to explode we'd still see it and feel its heat even eight hours after it exploded. In the same way he still feels the presence of his father in his life even if it has been a year since his tragic death. He fears however that those eight hours are running out and wants to do something about it before it's too late. How can he continue to feel the presence of his father in his life? He believes that with this new expedition he will continue to keep his memory, but what he doesn't realize is that by embarking on this journey he will encounter many other people and hear their stories. The movie is very emotional and had me holding back my tears. I really found it powerful and enjoyed Horn's performance, although I really got more involved with the movie when Max von Sydow's character showed up. He deserved the nomination for best supporting actor because he really lifted this movie. The scene where Oskar shares his story to this stranger is just so powerful, I really enjoyed this film. I wouldn't have nominated it for Best Picture, but I still enjoyed it even more than I did War Horse, The Descendants, and The Help so my major complain won't be why this got nominated, but how Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Drive, Harry Potter, and Warrior didn't.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

51,juneebuggy,A fantastic story about healing and a child's view of grief,8,3 May 2015,"This was a very good movie. Its moving and raw at times, a different sort of 911 story, from the view of a child losing a father. On that level it was relatable for me and at times I found it painful to watch the 9 year old boys grief, anger and confusion.Sandra Bullock is excellent as his mother, watching him from afar as her son searches NY city for the lock matching a mysterious key that once belonged to his father who was killed in the World Trade Center. Thomas Horn does an incredible job as 'Oskar', what a exhausting role for him. He suffers from an (undisclosed) mental illness and his freak out scenes are super well done, intense. I also enjoyed Max von Sydow. Tom Hanks' role is small here, mostly shown through flashbacks.Ultimately the story will grip your heart, its about healing and how not everything in life can be explained. I think I probably appreciated this movie more because I had read the book first though. This must have been a hard translation to make and I think they did a good job. I liked the changes especially in regards to the mother being more aware. 4/12/15",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
52,3xHCCH,My Low Expectations Made Me Like This Movie,7,7 February 2012,"""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" tells the sad story of a ""special"" child Oscar (Thomas Horn) who lost his father (Tom Hanks) in the World Trade Center attacks on 9-11. A difficult year later, Oscar breaks a blue vase in his father's closet and finds a key. In his effort to extend his connection to his father, Oscar goes on a quest all over New York City to track down the lock which the key opens.I admit it was not very easy to watch Oscar dealing with his father's death since they were very close with each other. The fact that Oscar had some special sort of Asperger's-like, Obsessive-Compulsive syndrome made it even more difficult. In his quest, Oscar was very methodical and precise in order to maximize his time. However in the process, he meets all of these people who all had problems of their own. You do feel that such a ""quest"" was highly unlikely to have happened in real life, but the story-telling of Director Stephen Daldry and the riveting performance of Thomas Horn as Oscar will draw you in up to the end. Supporting performances of Sandra Bullock (as Oscar's mother) and Max Von Sydow (as Oscar's mute neighbor) also score points for this film.I watched this film only because it had been nominated for Best Picture in the coming Oscar Awards. It is not really my type of film. This was the last of the 9 nominees I watched. I was thinking it would probably rank last in the list of 9 because it had no other nominations, except for that of Max Von Sydow. My low expectations actually made me like this film!

54,EUyeshima,9/11 as a Dramatic Device Both Contrived and Affecting,6,30 March 2012,"I believe it's been seven years since I read Jonathan Safran Foer's audacious 2005 novel which despite its deliberate ties to 9/11, left me a bit cold. Director Stephen Daldry (""The Reader"") and screenwriter Eric Roth (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") have adapted the contemporary plot from the book eschewing the foundational World War II flashback which provided much of the emotional springboard for the 9/11-triggered events that engulf the young protagonist, Oskar, a precocious and lonely eleven-year-old living on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Foer challenged the reader by making Oskar borderline autistic in order to dissect the psychological devastation induced by 9/11 in its most basic terms with the loss of his father. Daldry and Roth wisely chose a first-time actor, Thomas Horn, to embody Oskar as someone more experienced would have likely come across as too mannered and sympathetic for such a polarizing figure. On the other hand, Horn, a former Jeopardy! champion, embodies the character's sharp intellect, lack of amiability, and monomaniacal sense of purpose with surprising acuity. It's either an impressive debut or an exhausting one-shot performance as he is in almost every scene of the film.On his own idiosyncratic terms, Daldry attempts to present 9/11 as a malevolent, almost surreal act that turns an otherwise banal and safe world into one of seeping paranoia and immeasurable fear. Still reeling from the World Trade Center death of his gregarious, life-loving father Thomas, Oskar has hidden the phone machine, on which his father left six messages, away from his low-key attorney mother Linda. A year after the tragedy, the troubled boy finds a unique way to deal with his grief when he inadvertently breaks a blue vase in his father's closet as he rifles through his father's effects hoping for some kind of message left behind. Finding an envelope with a key inside the broken vase, Oskar notices the envelope is marked ""Black"", and his imagination reels with what he thinks is the legacy of his father's scavenger hunts. Tethered to nothing in the way of logic, he sets out across the breadth of New York City to meet and question all 472 people named Black in the phone book, so he can find out what the key unlocks. This is where Oskar's quest takes flight as he bounces from one encounter to another looking for a clue.Joining him for much of his journey is the Renter, a mute tenant that his grandmother shelters in her apartment across the street. His identity holds a certain clue to the mystery surrounding his father but not the one Oskar is looking for. The boy also intersects with a divorcing couple who tie into another thread of the mystery. As it does in the source novel, all of the events and character tics come across as rather contrived to support the 9/11 allegory being presented, even though the film itself is handsomely produced with first-rate camera-work by Chris Menges. The performances by the rest of the cast compensate as well. In small supporting roles despite their star billing, Tom Hanks is ideally cast as Thomas, and Sandra Bullock - in her first role since ""The Blind Side"" - brings quiet dignity and strength to Linda. Viola Davis (""The Help"") and Jeffrey Wright (""The Ides of March"") make vivid cameo impressions as the angst-filled couple, while Max Von Sydow (""The Seventh Seal"") does wonders in a restrained turn as the Renter. But the film's emotional burden never really elevates the themes that Daldry wants desperately to convey in a sea of contrivance. Ultimately, this narrative burden makes 9/11 fade into the background more than it should, and one is left with the forlorn feeling that the event has been more exploited than explored.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
55,robertemerald,Heart-lifting community orientated child drama,10,5 April 2019,"If you enjoyed movies like Empire of the Sun and A.I. then you're in for a treat with this one. All three movies centre around a deadly serious child suddenly orphaned, though in this case only partially, although again, through his relationship with his father, whom is tragically killed, is seen as a far stronger than that with the mother. With his father's death this boy loses his best friend, and it's a strong and involved relationship, and full of powerful inventiveness and charm. But this movie is about far more than tragic loss. Basically if you had to specifically design a genius movie that would emphasise New York's enduring community spirit after 9/11, then you'd come up with Extremely Loud, and you would have to be a genius yourself. This piece is moving all the way through. Around every corner is new delight. Around every corner (and it travels all over the city) is a new broad smile, or a gut-wrenching tear. It's all the more remarkable as the child actor here had never played a role before.

56,jadepietro,An Honest and Moving Film About Tragedy,8,24 January 2012,"This film is recommended.One of the most disturbing images of 9/11 was a photograph, rarely seen and unpublished at the time. This picture showed a grainy close-up of the exterior view of the Twin Towers. On first view, a small blurred gray image of possible debris is seen free falling toward the streets below. Upon a closer look, one realizes that this unclear shape is actually a human being somersaulting to his death. Truly tragic and heartbreaking. Just like that Tuesday morning in September.That sorrowful image appears in Stephen Daldry's film, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. But this time, the tiny speck of life has been fictionalized and given a name of a possible victim, the father of our central character, Oskar, a bright but precocious child who has Asberger's Syndrome, a mild form of autism. This adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's bestselling novel stars newcomer Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell, a sad and confused eleven year-old boy whose father ( Tom Hanks ) perishes during World Trade Center tragedy of 9/11. Obsessed with ""The Worst Day,"" as he calls it, Oskar tries to cope with his loss and his grieving mother's ( Sandra Bullock) distancing moods. He soon discovers a key in his deceased father's belongings which sets him off on a journey to find its companion lock and help him make sense of it all. ( It's the same idea as in Hugo, that literal connection to a deceased father, but here it is more somber and tear-jerking. ) On the way, he befriends an elderly man who does not speak ( Max Von Sydow ) and meets other New Yorkers who help complete his personal odyssey to find some inner peace and closure.Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close uses a fictionalized story to tell its tale of grief, pain, and redemption. At times, the film tends to overdo the sentimental aspects of its storyline and loses its way logically. One wonders about Oskar's independent travels and the dangers that he could easily encounter along the way, the lack of parenting skills, the cost factor, and the overall foolishness of his mission. ( I also had some trouble accepting the adult-looking results of his artistic endeavors and the engineering skills accrued on a pre-teenager level.)That aside, the film is emotionally satisfying and downright moving. Director Stephen Daldry elevates the material and minimizes the mawkish elements of the novel. He is unafraid to show the unpleasant side of Oscar ( his self mutilation, his tantrums, his anger issues ) and expertly reveals the tension between his mother and the confused state of his bottled-up feelings and guilt. Daldry's subtly infers the touching moments of 9/11 with a frank and honest treatment of the human condition ( a woman's off- screen look as she cradles her hands to hide her tears from her child, the sudden collapse of a child falling to his knees in sorrow, people gazing aimlessly upon a makeshift wall of photographs of lost loved ones, an old man pleading silently not to hear any more about that horrible day, etc ). He directs his actors well, especially Horn who gives a totally natural and compelling performance in a very difficult role. Adding solid support are Bullock, von Sydow in two very understated and affecting portrayals of 9/11 survivors, as well as Hanks and Viola Davis in smaller roles.The film runs on for too long, meandering like its main character. More judicious editing could have quicken the pacing and still maintained the film's thin storyline. Oskar's encounters with the many red herrings to his mystery becomes redundant and unnecessary. ( More time spent on the family dynamics post 9/11, between parent and child, would have made an even stronger film. )Still, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a post-9/11 tearjerker that earns its tears. It refuses to manipulate those tragic events in September and allows the moviegoer to face this national disaster in a sad yet uplifting way. Oskar's journey may be an unrealistic and convoluted plot device, but the emotions it incurs are true and poignant.Let me end this review with an oxymoron that Oskar himself would appreciate: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is awfully good. GRADE: BNOTE: This film has garnered some extremely negative and incredibly bad reviews from some critics who found it to be contrived and exploitive. I did not find that to be the case here. Perhaps our country still has not come to terms with this tragedy. Hopefully, with the help of talented filmmakers, more courageous films about this tender subject will be made and become part of our healing process.NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
57,p-stepien,Autism and 9/11 Fail to Mix,5,18 January 2013,"When autistic Oscar Schell (Thomas Horn) loses his father during the 9/11 collapse of the World Trade Center, the sense of loss is overwhelming. When he comes across a mysterious key in his father's locker, he decides to embark on a quest to discover its mystery, influenced by similar games revolving around solving logical puzzles as part of prolonged field trips organised by his father. The sole clue behind the key its attribution to the surname Black, hence Oscar starts a his prolonged mission to visit and document each and every black in the New York metropolis in search of ultimate clues. With his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) equally disparaged by events, Oscar has to do this on his own, at least until a mysterious elder renter (Max von Sydow) living with his grandma joins the quest.With a decade past from 9/11 the events are still extremely fresh and any director attempting to deal with the issues is set for collision with emotional burden and balancing the tentative melodrama. Stephen Daldry's body of work suggests vast competence of conviction, but alas the subject goes over his head, as he forces himself into a corner of contrition and forced attempts at wringing out some tears. The story itself is pretty entertaining and somewhat reflective, but the overall layers of false dramaturgy hamper any true impact, as you can almost physically feel Daldry attempting to wring out a tear or two. This isn't helped much by Thomas Horn, who pretty ineffectually attempts to play awkward, instead just being a irritating and unconvincing main character, which is forced upon the viewing audience with his endless clue hunt into New York. Naturally playing a character with stinted emotional cognisance is always a challenge, hence I understand why many disagree on this pointer. Both Hank and Bullock do respectively well, the first are the initiator of loss and with his story mostly centred around several harrowing messages left by his character just before the towers collapse. Meanwhile Bullock pulls off an excellent engrieved wife and mother with a key role in supplying closure to events that unfold.The story incorporates Oskar's ventures into a journey into lives of ordinary Americans, each supposedly touched or changed by the visit, essentially immortalised with a picture and served to viewers as crudely profound and lacking true emotional weight.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
58,moviexclusive,"One of the best 9/11 dramas you'll see, this poignant and uplifting story is ultimately a reaffirming tale of resilience and reconciliation",8,22 February 2012,"A fair warning before you step into this 9/11 drama based on the acclaimed novel by Johnathan Safran Foer- the protagonist, a nine-year- old boy living in New York City, isn't someone you'll embrace easily, even though the fact that he had lost his father in the Twin Towers should win much sympathy. Indeed, while we may accept a certain degree of immaturity from the kid due to his age, it's appalling to hear him say that his dad- whose body like the thousands who perished was never found- might just be 'dog faeces' in Central Park, or that he wished it was his mother who had lost her life instead.Oskar Schell (played by newcomer Thomas Horn) is rather the abrasive kid who is both precocious and socially awkward- though test results on Asperger's syndrome turned out inconclusive. One year after that fateful day, Oskar steps inside his father's closet and finds a key inside an envelope with the name 'Black' scrawled on the front. Thinking that it might be one of his father, Thomas' (Tom Hanks), elaborate puzzles he used to concoct in order to force his son to interact with people, Oskar sets off on a personal quest to track down the source of the key.Equipped with a backpack of essentials- including an Israeli gas mask, 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawkings, and a tambourine that he uses to calm himself amid the din and bustle of the city- Oskar traverses by foot through the five boroughs of New York knocking on the doors of everyone with the last name 'Black' he can locate in the phone book. Some of the people he meets include a married couple (Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright) on the verge of divorce, a religious woman who offers up Oskar's mission to God, and a transsexual with a lifestyle too wild for Oskar's comfort- it takes all sorts to make the world, and if each of these attempts turn out futile, it at least fulfils his father's hope that Oskar will learn to be more sociable.Each encounter is also an affirmation of the collective tragedy that was 9/11, as Oskar's story moves those he meets to concern and compassion be they survivors or mourners. The unanimous display of empathy is poignant, reaffirming humanity's ability to unite behind grief and loss. But screenwriter Eric Roth makes this journey as much about the mutual heroism of New Yorkers trying to make sense and come to terms with the senselessness and devastation as it is about an individual family's struggle to recover from the very disaster.Just as affecting therefore is the examination of the effect that Thomas' death has on the dynamics of the family- the mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) coping with her husband's passing while trying her best to win the understanding and love of her son; and the grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) thrust into an uneasy position as Oskar's confidant even as he rebuffs his mother. Oskar also forms a connection with a certain mysterious Renter (Max von Sydow) living in his grandmother's apartment, whose willingness to accompany Oskar on his trips belies a painful secret and a deeper personal motivation.No stranger to heavy-handed dramas, director Stephen Daldry (his fourth feature after the critically acclaimed 'Billy Elliot', 'The Hours' and 'The Reader') handles the potentially histrionic proceedings with surprising deftness. Especially heartrending is Linda's predicament- a scene where she breaks down from hearing Oskar say the words 'I love you' just outside the main door after he leaves in a huff is particularly touching; while a plot twist late into the movie that shows the extent of a mother's love for her son will leave only the hardest of hearts unmoved. Bullock is uncharacteristically low-key but very effective in the role, her heartbreak keenly felt through her grimaces and tears.Daldry also gets an excellent performance from von Sydow- with wordless shrugs and sighs, he effortlessly conveys his character's troubled past, one so traumatising that he has chosen to remain silent and relate to others with a simple 'yes' on one palm and 'no' on the other. And at the heart of it all is Thomas Horn's mesmerising turn, the 'Kids Jeopardy' winner utterly captivating as the bright but socially inept kid trying desperately to cling onto the one thing that he thinks will help him remain connected to his deceased father.Appropriately then, the film has been nominated for Best Picture honours- though amongst the nine nominees this year, this is probably the lowest rated overall by critics. Many have criticised Daldry's mawkish sentimentality for undermining the material, but in truth, we thought there was much restraint and nuance in his method. In fact, Daldry deserves praise for preserving both the poignancy and pathos of his source novel, delicately portraying both the effect of 9/11 on a sensitive boy and his family as well as that of the larger community around him. True it takes some time to get to understand Oskar on his level, but the very fact that Daldry has retained the inherent eccentrics of his key character is the surest sign that this is not your typical maudlin 9/11 drama. It is stimulating to say the least, extremely tender and incredibly uplifting.www.moviexclusive.com",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
59,intelearts,499th Review: An elegiac film...,6,26 March 2012,"EL&IC is a poem, an elegy, about 9/11 - it is packed with possible allegories and pictures, even clues in itself, and it always takes the sensitive side. All in all, it is a complex, interesting attempt to deal with many of the deeper issues that 9/11 raised in the American psyche, while always remaining wistful. Any film about 9/11 runs the risk of being seen as either maudlin or insensitive - the singular nature and its subsequent effects - social, political, and cultural are too vast to be encompassed and EL&IC acknowledges that by instead focusing on the minutiae of one boy's attempt to construct meaning out of the unthinkable. It does so through a seemingly insurmountable treasure hunt and puzzle of a key that must belong somewhere but offers only seemingly impossibilities.This is a film that really does reward careful viewing - watched for the plot alone it is satisfactory - but watched as a key itself to some of the more difficult notions of coping and identity it is powerful. There is a strand in contemporary American philosophy based on Dewey, Davidson and Rorty - pragmatism and neopragmatism - that this film could be said to borrow from - that that meaning and happiness come from where we see the world and ask how the world is - but that subsequent reality is not simply perception but rather we must interact at the space created - and while I wouldn't want to labor the point, this perhaps is the journey here - and the film asks us also to go into that space, and to share it, and see the dialog there.Any film that allows us to take the journey of a child and still raises questions about grief and coping is not an easy balance, but this is a film I would recommend as addressing those issues while still retaining some sense of wonder - and that is no small achievement.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
60,MartianOctocretr5,"Emotionally charged journey of a child trying to breathe order into a chaotic, fateful moment",7,5 May 2012,"An ambitious effort that, like so many risk-taking movies, had its share of both memorable, touching aspects and others that were grating and overdone.To say it's emotionally charged is an understatement. Thomas Horn's performance as an autistic child is outstanding and noteworthy. At times the character is grossly overstated by the script and the direction. These occasional exaggerations of the nature of autism undermine the very real personification by Horn. At times the character is endearing, but at other times is rendered as a screaming, irritable, detestable monster who annoys people and oftentimes drives himself into contrived and irrational frenzies. You can only portray mental illness effectively up to a point, then it becomes milking for schmaltz, even exploitation. The director reached this tone a few times.The story is not about Sept. 11, but the unpredictability inherent in life and common to us all. That horrible day provides an effective base, however, as the backdrop for the story, as the child (named Oskar) embarks on a quest to find out about a key he finds in his father's effects about a year after the the disaster. In a cruel twist of fate, his father was one of the dead in one the collapse of one of the towers of the World Trade Center, and the child is still trying to make sense of the chaos through his grief. The key, an obvious metaphor, is marked only by the word, Brown. He assumes it's a person's name, and launches a campaign to meet each and every person he can find by that name; people whose lives have their own sorrows. The journey itself is the story, and Oskar learns: in ways even all of his obsessive calculation of numbers and time-lines could never reveal to him.Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks, as his parents are magnificent, and the methodology of using montages in memories works adequately. The story is paced well, with important revelations being complete surprises toward plot development. The epilogue sequence of the characters evaluating what they've experienced is well done; it avoids expository lines, and just unfolds.In some ways the story goes beyond the realistic. The child being allowed to wander about New York's 80 zillion people, just doesn't make any sense in any reality, even a movie. Nobody stops him, questions him, or anything, in spite of lame lies that he tells. Especially a movie about a child with emotional instability. It's hard to swallow, and will be in the back of your mind even as he travels about on public transit (notorious for its very real dangers) seeking out people. This may have been necessary to thread the story, but there must have been a better way for him to contact people. Call? Write? Try finding them on-line at Facebook? Anything?So the movie has its extremely emotional moments and a few incredibly goofed up parts. Overall, though, it's touching with a clearly stated moral to it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
61,saadgkhan,I feel like throwing Oskar's tambourine in the East River and sending him off to swap written messages in silence with his grandfather.,2,9 April 2012,"Extremely Loud & incredibly Close - TRASH IT (C-) Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close should have been called Extremely Rude & Incredibly Annoying. The movie is about a 9 years old boy who losses his father in 9/11 and finds a way to cope with death of his father by finding the secret box which can be opened with the hidden key he found in his father's closet. Osker Schell is undoubtedly the most annoying, rude & abrasive character I've seen in recent times. While watching the movie, I just wished for someone to slap him hard enough to snap him out of all this nonsense. There are things which he calls his old doorman e.g suck my balls sack or You Suck etc without any reason. This shows how clearly demented and sick this child is, his father may call him different and special but we know where the Special Kids should be. On one hand it indicates that Thomas Horn Aka. Osker is a talented young actor but on the other it proves that director made a wrong choice in choosing an actor and creating a character that made people furious against his actions. It's very simply if you don't feel lover or remorse for the main protagonist it's hard to appreciate what even good he is doing. And when it's reveled that his mom is also going & meeting all the people with name Black in NY/Brooklyn just like his son was an extreme shocker as the mother has also lost it after death of her husband. 9/11 is a sensitive issue but using it in this story was kind of a drag for me. I've not read the novel so I don't know why it was a best seller but after watching this movie I simply can say a movie about an abrasive rude boy is not something worth making. Performances by Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Thomas Horn, Viola Davis and Max Von Sydow are good but honestly still writing this review about this movie is making me furious. I won't recommend this movie in a million years to anyone.

62,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Extremely Dumb and Incredibly Cringe-worthy,3,15 April 2017,"To be fair, I do think that most of the actors did a good job, and that the general plot of this film as well as its camera work, it was all done very well. But the main character, that annoying as hell little boy, he got on my last nerve and his behaviour (which by the way has been chalked up to autism in the film, because I suppose all autistic children must be little monsters who bother people and slap their parents and curse and swear) got on my last nerve every time. I loved the scenes with the various people who he meets on his journey through New York, from a friendly drag queen to a woman going through a messy breakup with her husband, but we hardly get much more than a glimpse into all their lives because the film is so focused on this self-indulgent, bratty and rude little snot of a child who whines repeatedly in narration about what a huge toll 9/11 took on his own life, but who is too focused on himself to see what the disaster did to his mother or to anyone else who lost loved ones when it happened. I think that the doorman (only a minor character) and the grandfather were both certainly some of the most interesting in the story, bringing some comic relief to various scenes, and later on profound sadness in the grandfather's case. 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' is in many ways akin to the 2015 film 'The Rainbow Kid' with its journey of quirky characters met along the way, except that in the case of the latter, the main character was actually likable. I mean this boy in here is so pretentious and nasty and self-centered that it almost had me thinking he'd make a good villain! I felt horrible for his mother and kept wishing under my breath that she'd lock him out of the apartment during one of his little day trips just to teach him a lesson in respect.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
63,Screen_Blitz,"Alternating between deeply riveting and overly contrived, this movie falls short of cinematic mastery",6,7 January 2017,"It was September 11, 2001 when our nation was gripped with a devastating tragedy, a tragedy that lead to the disappearance of the twin towers at the hands of terrorists from Al-Qaeda. As the planes crashed and the towers collapsed, millions of people watched as thousands of innocent lives were lost. Since this day, it has become a day America will never forget. This catastrophic event serves as the emotional backdrop of this melodramatic drama inspired by the novel of the same name by Jonathan Safran Foer. Director Stephen Daldry, the man responsible for 'Billy Elliot', 'The Hours', and 'The Reader' makes a somewhat competent translation of Foer's novel which strictly centers on a youth struggling to make sense of the tragic event that snatched a great chunk of his life away from him. It is safe to say Daldry's efforts pay off in some areas but still leave something more to be desired in the process. This film stars young Thomas Horn as 11-year old Oskar Schell who's developed a close relationship with his father Thomas Schell (played by Tom Hanks) through their adventures of trekking the streets of Manhattan in their scavenger hunts. When the 9/11 attacks suddenly hit New York, young Oskar and his mother Linda (played by Sandra Bullock) are abruptly hit with tragedy upon learning Thomas is killed in the catastrophe. One years rolls by and Oskar wanders into his father's closet to find a key on his coat. Out of curiosity, Oskar goes on an emotional trek to find where his father's secret key leads to while forming a bond with a silent elder man (played by Max Von Sydow).This emotionally charged drama piece is certainly doesn't turn out as the firmly haunting vehicle Stephen Daldry and writer Eric Roth aim for. But it is clear that this movie at least has it's heart in the right place. After all, the film efficaciously builds up a deeply emotional atmosphere surrounding the tragedy that leaves the lead character lost in a sea of uncertainty and loneliness. The young lad has just lost his father, he has no friends, and has ever since felt emotionally distant from his mother who he rarely takes the time to talk to. As the story proceeds, Oskar morphs into a character you learn to sympathize with, especially for those who have to dealt with a similar tragedy or perhaps lost a loved one in the 9/11 attacks. The main area in which the film falters is the story elements. Stephen Daldry and Eric Roth engineer a story that desperately calls for viewers to weep buckets. While some of the story elements are somewhat successful at scoring this, the others tend to come off a bit contrived to the point of being a little exploitative than genuine. That is not to say Eric Roth doesn't know how to come up with a realistic tale, especially one that hits close to home. After all, the performances are at least decent, particularly Max Von Sydow as the muted elderly man who's performance is limited to sign language and him writing words on his bare hands when communicating with the lead character. Tom Hanks does a fine job but his severely limited screen time render his performance less memorable than most of his other roles, the same can be said about Sandra Bullock in her role as the mother. Finally, Thomas Horn's performance is pretty average, constantly alternating back and forth between genuine and emotionally forced. Then again, Eric Roth's screenplay is easily the reason behind this.Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a mildly solid drama that has the performances, the direction, and the ingenious message about learning the accept the reality of how some things are left unanswered to make for a marginally entertaining cinematic piece. In other hand, its overly contrived script is a major factor that keeps the film from reaching the masterful cinematic piece to sets out to be.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
64,ketgup83,Literally very loud and not close to your heart at all !!,4,5 March 2012,"Extremely Loud & incredibly close was pathetically boring which has good story line but was bogged down by a weak script and average performances. An young inventor goes out through the streets of New York to search for a lock which he believes will bring him close to father who dies in 9/11 September attack Extremely loud & incredibly close , directed by Stephen Daldry , is yet another tragic story based on the traumatic events post 9/11 attacks which focuses on the situation in a family after the head of family is killed in the unfortunate incident. Though, the director takes another turn to tell the story of a aspiring teenager who has always been mentored by his father never to stop looking, still the drama falls flat on the face. The film deliberately drags and message is unraveled right just at the climax when you are nailed down by a weak screenplay. Clearly, the Oscar nomination for this film is a bit overrated. Cinematography is good. Background score goes along with the film. Performances are just about average with veteran actors like Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock completely wasted in their small parts. Is strictly OK with few scenes and he basically goes over the top in others. So , overall , Extremely loud & incredibly close is a colossal disappointment.

65,proud_luddite,Too Many Weaknesses,5,29 December 2020,"In New York City after the World Trade Centre attacks, a young boy deals with a personal tragedy by pursuing information left behind by a loved one.I would have to agree with some of the nicknames given to this film including ""Extremely Annoying and Incredibly Cloying"". Young actor Thomas Horn does his best in the role of the boy. This is a difficult task for two reasons. One is that he must carry the entire film on his shoulders as he's in nearly every scene. The other is that the boy is such an obnoxious ogre that it is difficult to sympathize with him in any possible way.This is the major weakness in a story that has other weaknesses as well. By the end, one wonders what the hell was the point of this movie? Not to say the film is completely terrible. There are some interesting plot elements in the second half. There are also fine performances by dependable actors like Max Von Sydow, Viola Davis, and Jeffrey Wright.

Studios have paid for positive reviews in the press for decades; why not corrupt IMDb.Despite the ridiculous summary, the boy is NOT an amateur inventor, not a Frankophile, nor a pacifist, nor is he 9 years old. The father, played by Tom Hanks is too good to be true; or is it not a good thing for a dad to be full-time immersed in his son's life, yet he fails to notice his son is friendless --- and that he skips school frequently, giving excuses which we're supposed to take as cute.The boy is over-funded by his parents, disrespectful, disobedient, and often downright mean.The diversity agenda is another negative. Of course since the boy is tracking down persons named ""Black"" that the first and several will be African Americans, but I doubt many Chinese are named ""Black"" and the film did not need a mandatory homosexual (in a non-speaking role lasting 3 seconds).

69,cultfilmfan,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,9,23 January 2012,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is based on the novel of the same name by Jonathan Safran Foer. The film takes place in New York City right after the attack on the world trade centre. The film focuses on a nine year old boy named Oskar Schell and is basically about how he deals with the death of a loved one who he lost on 9/11 and his journey to find where a mysterious key belongs, that belonged to the person in Oskar's life who was killed in the attacks. The rest of the movie is Oskar's journey to see who, or what the missing key goes to, or who it belongs to. Along the way on his journey it is more than anything a journey of self discovery where Oskar finds out a lot more about himself, his family and is able to finally grieve and get braver and tackle his fears and his emotions. One thing that I personally found quite refreshing about Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is the writing and performance by Thomas Horn, of Oskar himself. He is not your average movie leading character. Oskar is unique because of the fact that he has a lot of trouble socializing and is rather awkward doing so, but in another way longs to connect and be close to the ones around him. He is highly intelligent and has a certain set of interests and hobbies that he focuses on, almost to the point of obsessively. He has a hard time dealing with his feelings and also seems to have a hard time showing empathy, or being able to connect with people. On the other hand, when Oskar does meet someone he tries to put aside these barriers and can become quite chatty and verbal and he seems to connect best when dealing with adults, or people who are older than himself. He exhibits some very strange behaviour patterns and what seems to be some obsessive compulsive disorder and other nervous habits throughout the film. Unfortunately to many this will probably annoy viewers and they may be turned off by Oskar's bizarre and unorthodox behaviour and mannerisms. I, on the other hand, felt it refreshing to have a leading character in a film that is a little different and his eccentricties and barriers made him all the more interesting I think. Maybe, I also liked that aspect of the film because I could relate to his character having been very much like that myself through adolescent and teenage years and even to an extent now as an adult. The film deals with some pretty heavy issues such as grief and the loss of a loved one and coming to terms with those emotions which for anyone can be very painful and hard to deal with. There are a few times where I felt like my throat was swelling up and it was difficult to swallow because some scenes really came across powerfully with all the emotion that they had in them. However, I did not find it overly melodramatic, or done to shock, or to get feelings from the audience by loud melodramatic, or bombastic music just to get any emotion out of the characters, or audience at all. I think here, unlike a film such as The Descendants, we can really connect to these characters and feel the pain they are feeling and connect with them on many different levels, so it feels more real, instead of false, or as if the film were trying too hard to be manipulative and preachy. The acting here is all terrific as well. I mentioned above young Thomas Horn, who puts everything into his performance as Oskar, and does a great job here. The entire supporting cast is all on the top of their game here as well and deliver wonderful performances. I also liked the story that accompanied the film. It is an interesting premise complete with well developed and interesting characters and making you connect with them because of what they are facing and it is even more relevant because what they are facing is real and something we can all connect with in some way, or another. I am not sure if everyone would get as much as I did out of this film because as I said Oskar's behaviour will turn off some viewers as well as the sadness felt during the film and the fact that it's general subject of grief and sadness is still so present and sensitive to so many people that some may choose not to see the film for that very reason. I personally found it to be a touching and insightful story of one young boy's adventures and how he learns to grow and deal with things that he once could not and all in all isn't that something we all have struggled with and have hoped to overcome? This is an intriguing and well worth seeing film.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
70,Quietb-1,Neither loud or close,4,30 December 2011,"Seems like a marketing nightmare for the studios involved in this one. Tough to get title correct. Not the roles you want to see for Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, but you don't see much of them anyway.

The Sandra Bullock ""I've been there"" angle seems like something added after test screenings said ""what kind of mother would let their kid run around New York alone"".You felt the hand of the writer in a few scenes that felt strained to drag out an emotional audience response. The conversation about ""I wish I was in the building instead..."" is one example.Good simple score was a highlight.

71,itamarscomix,Oskar bait,7,21 February 2012,"I'm honestly surprised at the amount of controversy stirred up by this movie. It's not a masterpiece, no; it's not any better, but it's also not any worse, than dozens of award-season dramas that are nominated for Oscars, don't win, and are completely forgotten later on.A large portion of the criticism seems to come from the controversy about whether or not the film exploits the 9/11 attacks. I can certainly understand people being offended by the use of 9/11, and my advice is, if you think you might get offended, don't watch it. You won't miss a great movie; Spike Lee's 25th Hours referenced 9/11 in a more intelligent way years ago. In EL&IC Tom Hanks' character might have died in an earthquake or a fire as easily, and the movie wouldn't change that much; but the fact that it's 9/11 makes it more universal and more powerful, and I never for a moment felt the use was exploitative. The movie's biggest flaw is that it's too sentimental and idealistic (as you would expect from this kind of movie) and it treats the trauma of the attacks with complete respect.The other big flaw, for me, is in oversimplifying the original novel. The novel relates two stories - that of Oskar, and that of his grandparents, and the movie completely dismisses the second, more interesting one. While the adaptation of Oskar's story is very straightforward and loyal, losing the grandparents' story deprives the movie of several layers of depth (and doesn't replace them with style, like Everything is Illuminated did - another movie based on a novel by Jonathan Safarn Foer, which also chose to adapt only one of the two stories in the novel). As a result, the movie becomes a much more simple story, that of a boy dealing with his fears and with his father's death; for what it is, it works, but it's such a shame to see Max Von Sydow's terrific acting go to waste because his fascinating character was rendered into a flat secondary player.For all that it is, though, EL&IC is not a bad movie. It's a simple little coming-of-age story, with some solid acting - Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are not among my favorite actors but they do surprisingly well with their small roles - it's well shot, well paced and keeps the viewer interested, and it even manages to get some genuine emotional involvement. It's a lot like many other similar movies and, no, it's definitely not the best movie of the year - it will fade into obscurity by Christmas. But it's also not the worst of the year, or even the worst of the Oscar nominees, and it's really a pretty good watch.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
72,jrarichards,"Tremendous, cathartic and necessary - stick with it, no matter what",10,7 May 2017,"Just as it took British Director Paul Greengrass to address the issue of the September 11th flight that was brought down by its passengers in Pennsylvania in his 2006 film ""United 93"", so here it is left to Britain's Stephen Daldry to try to make some sense of the unbelievable tragedy and loss that the destruction of the Twin Towers denoted (for people all over the world). That was always going to be a tough one, and all the more so when whimsy and near-fantasy occasionally seem to mingle in with the biggest of all real-life stories, in which any form of good news is at an absolute premium.Doubtless many will feel that Daldry has not done the job properly, given the immense sensitivity of the issue, but that cannot be my view. ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" is actually a masterpiece that puts this reviewer strongly in mind of the very best work of Polish Director Krzysztof Kieslowski, with huge meaning imbued in an eclectic mix of one-off, chance-based mega-events and the ostensibly-uninspiring and uninteresting minutiae of everyday life. Here is a film of more than 2 hours that twists and turns, goes fast and slow, shifts emotions, seems to be becoming too light-hearted and then switches to deadly serious, and perhaps even taunts its viewers to reach for the ""off"" button more than once as it peaks into its most way-out moments.My strong advice is not to do that.Of course, Daldry had some help here, in the unlikely and amazingly appealing form of ""Jeopardy""-winning schoolkid (and non-actor) Thomas Horn, who appears aged around 14 and has not the slightest difficulty in upstaging veteran co-stars Tom Hanks (playing the father marooned on the 106th floor of one of the WTC Towers), Sandra Bullock (playing the widowed mother) and Max Von Sydow (playing the father's father, traumatised into muteness by his earlier-life experiences). It is a remarkable performance as a bright, intense, over-sensitive, troubled boy with mental-health issues even prior to 9/11, whose dad bonds with him and attempts to draw him out with search-games that offer an intriguing (and actually quite authentic-looking) mix of fantasy and science. The early scenes with father and boy together will invoke something special in any actual (or would-be) father of sons who takes the trouble to watch.Given that the New York background also allows for wartime Germany side-stories, as well as the tales of countless others putting a brave face on misery and loss, the September 11th events are - miraculously as it may seem - put in some kind of wider context in this movie. New York stars here as no-nonsense, but also eccentric and diverse, tough, with a wry sense of humour - the place that draws and has drawn refugees, sufferers and exiles for centuries. All of that is present, and much more besides, but the message is of victory over sadness and gloom, of people learning to own their sadness and shedding their selfish concerns to help somebody else. The city of individualists somehow came together on 9/11, and the characters in this film do the same in response to events following on from that tragedy-cum-outrage. Ironic that brutality and suffering are needed to bridge what would otherwise be unbridgeable gaps, yet amazing and beautiful that that can be so. At moments, this movie trumpets to the skies the true wonder that is man's humanity - rather than inhumanity - to man.This is then a simultaneously warm and weird offering that steps beyond any obvious background of description, yet offers something new and fresh and supremely meaningful.Genuinely what movies should be about.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
73,CountZero313,one boy's journey,8,3 May 2013,"Oskar loses his father Thomas in the September 11 tragedy. A delicate boy who may or may not have Asperger's, his father was an obsession, and the provider of others, and Oskar seeks to fill the void left by Thomas's demise by solving one last puzzle he thinks his father set him.Thomas Horn's precocious performance is startling, all flinty anger and open wounds as he sets out on his quest with ferocious determination, aided at first only by his comfort tambourine and faultless organizational skills. Later he is aided by The Renter, a mute tenant of his grandmother's. Played by Max von Sydow, this is a masterclass in acting as reacting. The film makes the astute choice of staying pretty much wholly with the boy's POV, building all the more emphatically to a third-act switch, a structure Daldry clearly favours at it follows the same template as The Hours. Staying with the boy means Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock have less to do than their star baggage would suggest, but what they have to do they do extremely well. Bullock shines in a third act that could have been gushing sentimentality, but in fact satisfactorily concludes the emotional journey Oskar has taken to stay connected with his father, and finally appreciate his mother. In the meantime, he manages to heal the rift in another couple's marriage, a story strand that is expertly threaded through with Oskar's quest.People seem to criticize this movie for two reasons; the saccharine sweet portrayal of pseudo-Asperger's (or conversely, they find the boy simply annoying), and the utilization of 9.11 tragedy as audience bait. Spending much of my time around Asperger's kids, I found young Horn's depiction to be palatable while not tipping into misrepresentation. As for the stern reactions to depictions of 9.11, films like Zero Dark Thirty, Argo and the like touch on other people's tragedies, but it seems those are marginal, 'other' tragedies, not worthy of consideration by po-faced critics who who can only frame 9.11 as THE tragedy, rather than another tragedy. Much myth-making swirls around the events of 9.11 and America's re-invention of itself since. ELIC is explicit in its mythologizing and so easier to engage with.Horn is mesmerizing, the Sixth Borough fable is magical, and the tale of how a child's innocence can heal wounded hearts is a soothing balm we all need to apply every now and again.

74,vostf,Cutesy thick sentimentalism,4,25 March 2012,"I am usually harsher on that kind of sentimentalism, that is I would be extremely close to call this outrageous sentimentalism if I were an American and could not bear to see 9/11 memories evoked for cheap sobs.Because, yes, this is an awfully heavy movie. The redeeming elements for me are Tom Hanks and Max von Sydow (always a pleasure) and, of course, New York although it's really verging on the over-dosed injection as with the global mood of the movie. The boy is good, I didn't find him annoying at all as an actor, but I am as bored as anybody with that writer's darling cliché of a kid too bright and conscious for his age and with a tense stare at things. Eventually Sandra Bullock and her nip-tuck plastic face are clearly miscast here - aye, it's really difficult to look credible mourning and crying with all the face-lift - and it's really hurting the movie as it unveils an inner falseness of spirit.So Stephen Daldry must be pretty full of himself to concentrate on such sentimentalism-loaded material and take so many years to just ship another load. Either he wants to compete head-on with Spielberg's Capra-inspired sentimentalism or just deliver what the Academy Awards seems to be craving for.This really is worst than a dumb fat movie because it takes two hours to tell you how much it's clever and cute and you have to love it and vote for it at the Awards' poll. Because it's only designed for people who can vote at the Awards, and us, the irrelevant audience will just follow and like what is good for us.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
75,JohnRayPeterson,"Unexpected ending for the most part and anything 9/11, too hard to watch",7,16 May 2012,"If you're like me, and have some tangible connection to the people in NYC, yours may be even remote; you will find it difficult to watch many parts of this movie. Add to that the lead character of young Oskar Schell, brilliantly played by Thomas Horn, I mean truly well done, who is a kid that was, as the title makes quite clear, close to his late father Thomas Schell, played by Tom Hanks, who died while on the phone from the WTC tower, trying to reach his son. His father knew how to deal with young Oskar's condition (I'm sure is Asperger's Syndrome) and managed to light up his life before 9/11. Oskar gets home and checks the answering machine that had four messages from his dad; he could never manage the courage to listen to the last. He replaced that machine with a new one keeping the original intact with the messages on it. I bet you can feel a lump in your throat right about now.The only thing that keeps Oskar from going over the deep end is a key he thinks his father left behind and he is determined beyond imagination to find that key's secret. He links up with a mute border at his grandmother's apartment, an old man; he sought his help to resolve the mystery. Max von Sydow plays that old man and oh, what a team they make; the interaction of the two improbable friends is an absolute pleasure to watch, but a bitter one, because there is more to the speechless old guy much more than you could imagine. Once again you feel just a little of your remaining felicity being sucked with precision.Oskar lashes out at the world, and his mother, played by Sandra Bullock. For most of the movie, you think she has given up on life and is a little detached when dealing with Oskar. Again, the movie will throw another one of those gut wrenching surprise about her and Oskar, as if the movie didn't have enough.The supporting cast is terrific, the key players flawless performers in this movie and the unravelling plot a pretty good piece of mystery adventure in a way. Too bad it makes you feel bluer than blue. Don't watch it unless you're ready to deal with the emotional pounding. I recommend you see 'The Hangover' as an antidote.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
76,Christian_Dimartino,"It deserved 2 Oscar nominations, but one of them was not Best Picture.",4,8 April 2012,"When Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close was nominated for Best Picture, I was angry. I hadn't seen it at the time, but it got bad reviews and I felt like something else should have been nominated. I just finished watching it 2o minutes ago, and the feeling still remains.The film revolves around a kid named Oskar Schell(Thomas Horn), who's father(Tom Hanks) was killed in 9/11. One day while snooping, he finds an envelope that says ""Black"" and has a key inside. Thinking it's a message from his father, Oskar sets out to find just what this key opens.Sandra Bullock gives a wonderful performance as Oskar's mom, who doesn't know what to do with this kid. And Max Von Sydow also gives a wonderful and Oscar nominated performance as a character known as The Renter, a mysterious mute who lives next door to Oskar's grandmother.The film received a whopping 2 Oscar Nominations, one for Best Picture, and the other for Best Supporting actor(Sydow). The film does deserve two Oscar nominations, but one of those is not for Best Picture, which this isn't even incredibly close to being. The other nomination, for me, goes to Bullock, who gives one of her best performances here.EL&IC is like The Blind Side of 2011: It's okay, but it's really not anything special. The acting is good, and the film is entertaining. But the film is focused on a kid who is possibly insane, and extremely annoying in moments. Horn, who won Jeopardy, gives a good performance, but it's just ashame the character is so annoying. I was actually starting to dislike it for the first hour, but once Sydow entered, it turned itself around.Also, there are a couple of moments in which Oskar does little things that bother me. And towards the end, I was sort of beginning to wonder just why this story had to be told. Overall, it's okay, but to put it on a list with The Descendants, Midnight in Paris, Hugo, The Help, Moneyball, and The Tree of Life is just absurd.Why was it nominated? Was it because of it's background topic? Was it because of Stephen Daldry? Or was it simply because the academy members were scraping the barrel? There were other movies that definitely deserved a position on that list. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, Melancholia, Mission: Impossible- Ghost Protocol, hell, even Scre4m. It's not one of the ten best, or the twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, but possibly in the 60's and 70's. At least it has that going for it.B-*Note* I have given it some thought, and it deserves a C. It's not a good movie.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
77,MattyGibbs,If you like emotional drama you'll love this,8,12 January 2013,"It is pretty obvious from reviews on here that this is a bit of a marmite film. I can understand why some people do not like it as it does take a while to get going and the subject matter isn't to everyone's taste. It will undoubtedly appeal much more to those with children. I found this to be a superbly executed drama about how people deal with the death of a loved one. The acting performances in this film are all top notch even from Sandra Bullock who has never impressed me previously. The performance of the young boy Thomas Horn is exceptional as is that of Max Von Sydow. People have picked holes in the plot and said it is unrealistic but you can say that about any film. I found Thomas Horn to be very believable, he wasn't supposed to be totally likable- this isn't Home Alone. The last hour of the film is really impressive and I loved the ending. It is a hard watch at times and I defy anyone with a heart not to be touched by this film in anyway. Give this film a chance and you may well be surprised like me at just how good it is.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

79,sashank_kini-1,Unjustly Lambasted and Sketchily Criticized,8,11 May 2012,"People eagerly anticipating for a movie of the year walk out if their expectations aren't met. Many people also hate movies where the protagonist is (i) a young boy and (ii) has a sharp tongue. It is alright for such people to vent their disappointment on the internet, for which there are blogs and my favorite IMDb, however, it seems harsh on their part to neglect all other aspects of the film and denounce it with a single star. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close may not be the 'best' film, however, to smear it with a single star and write 'I hated this film!!!' in an extremely short and incredibly contrived review is wrong, in my opinion. Also, for critics to deem it an 'overtly schmaltzy Oscar bait' is also inconsistent since the same people have hailed 'The Tree of Life' as the best film of the year.The 2011 film directed by Stephen Daldry narrates the quest of Oskar, a nine-year old precocious child with possible Asperser Syndrome, as he journeys to find the right lock to a mysterious key left by his late father, Thomas Schell who had died during the 9/11 crash. The title may also refer to the relationship between father and son whose love was intimate that they never failed to share their knowledge with one another. The duo was the thickest of friends, and the father's favorite game for his son was to give him a puzzle so that the latter would 'search'. The father, played by a slightly podgy Tom Hanks, was present on the 105th floor when the plane crashed, but he managed to leave six messages on his home number, which Oskar unfortunately hears. His father's sudden demise and the discovery of the key in a vase (which is broken by Oskar accidentally when he tries to grab the camera from the top cabinet of his father's closet) leads the young lad to his most adventurous and self-evolving search. Addressing the criticism about the implausibility of a boy as young as Oskar to navigate such a distance without using public transport for a majority of his journey, I think that the movie (and the book) should have chosen Thomas' wife or father as the protagonist instead of Oskar. To imagine Linda Schell (played here by Sandra Bullock) suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and searching for a solution to the key left by her husband would have been more believable than having Oskar scooting around NYC. Otherwise, the writer could have written a teenage Oskar instead of a nine year old boy. An aged man may also search for an answer for his son's death by searching the entire city. But since we are left with Oskar, I can only say that Thomas Horn is a seriously budding talent who should join an acting school soon; he has the range and natural talent that can be developed to a great extent. We may find his character to be abrasive, spoilt, tantrum-throwing and brattish, but we cannot deprive Thomas Horn of his credit.The other criticism targets the sentimentality in the film. Had this film not received a best picture nomination, all the deprecation regarding the sentimentality would have been far lesser. Also, people accuse the film of being'Oscar bait' which I find quite ridiculous – 2011's Iron Lady was surely an Oscar bait because of Phyllida Lloyd and the film's promoter's desperate attempts at giving Ms. Streep an Oscar (not entirely Meryl's fault as she did not play Thatcher with a goal to win the naked gold man, but I do condemn her poor decision to accept such a script), but EL&IC does not reek of Oscar bait; it is simply a heartwarming story which does not hesitate to use tears to convey grief and relief. EL&IC is a wonderful film and the multiple interpretations of lock and key work beautifully. Open your heart and you'll see that you love it!My Rating: 8.1 out of 10",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
80,TheSquiss,"Don't, just don't!",1,17 June 2012,"Why did I spend 129 minutes of my life watching Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close? Why did anybody think any part of this film warranted an Oscar nomination? What possessed Stephen Daldry to follow up Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader with this? Why was there nothing to like about the child, the principal character? Why is the horrid child not in a psychiatric ward or at least under therapy? Isn't this New York city where people pay for therapy even for chipped nail varnish? Why the constant god-awful narration? Is there any better proof that narration is a crutch to aid a crippled screenplay? Why is the screenplay so terribly, terribly, loooong and turgid? When will it end? Why does Daldry think that LOTS OF SHOUTING IMPLIES DEEP EMOTION? Would it have been a better film if the boy had died instead of his father? Why would an old man choose to be constantly insulted by a brat? Does the boy's mother really have no control to stop him roaming NYC with a strange old man? Could the outcome be any more obvious if it danced naked around a greasy pole wearing a neon sign that reads I'm easy, come and get me? Should it be called Extremely Long and Incredibly Crap or Extremely Long and Please Let Me Die I Can't Take Any More? On the positive side, the academy saw fit not to give it any Oscars and one question has been answered (see my review of Rampart): No, Rampart is no longer the worst film of the year (so far).Don't!

This results in the film being too long and I was just hoping it was going to end soon.The film only lights up when Tom Hanks is on screen although Max Von Sydow added some light relief to the heavy going.Even Sandra Bullock had nothing but depressing scenes.There were also many flaws in the storyline.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
82,ClaytonDavis,Extremely Talented Thomas Horn (***½),8,4 January 2012,"In the film ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" directed by Academy Award Nominee Stephen Daldry, we are exposed to a different side of the realm of sorrow and heartache not thought of before. The film tells the story of Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), a nine-year old boy whose father is killed on September 11th and embarks upon a quest to find the lock to a key found in his father's pocket. Along the way, Oskar meets a variety of characters including the mysterious ""renter' (Max Von Sydow) living in his grandmother's house. What Daldry achieves in ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" above all else, is capturing the sweet innocence of a child and breaking it down to raw moment number one, while never getting over zealous in the power he possesses. What Thomas Horn delivers as Oskar is by no mistake the greatest child performance of the new century. Horn dives into one of the most complex character's I've seen created for a child and shakes loose. Horn is a gift to the craft and will hopefully capitalize on this role for deeper, more demanding characters. Horn lives the words of screenwriter Eric Roth and lands every line like a symphonic note in a great sixteen-piece orchestra.Welcome Thomas Horn, the best new toy to grace the Hollywood shelves... The subject matter of the September 11 has been hit and miss over the past ten years in the world of cinema. Only Paul Greengrass' tear- jerking love letter to the victims of Flight 93 in the film, ""United 93″ has ever been considered a respectful interpretation and deliverance of the dreadful day. Chalk it up to being British or a non-American but Daldry is second on the shortlist now. Where it's nowhere near as polarizing as Greengrass' take, the film never uses the subject matter to tell the story. Daldry uses his craftsmanship and his love of film to drive us through this tale. While the film at instances seem to get away from him using one or two unneeded shots involving the World Trade Center, Daldry holds his own quite well and I respect him for it. Daldry's greatest strengths in his career is what he is able to get out of his esteemed casts (The Hours, The Reader, Billy Elliot). Sandra Bullock has fully evolved into a beautiful and demanding actress. Bullock is one of my all-time favorite women working in Hollywood. It's definitely hasn't been a smooth ride with choices like ""All About Steve"" and ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" but I've stuck by the notion she would deliver on the promise seen of her in the 80′s flick, ""Love Potion #9."" Where I feel she has struggled the most is her ability to portray a ""matronly"" or ""maternal"" figure accurately and convincingly. I found it difficult to feel that away about her in the Oscar winning role she portrayed in ""The Blind Side."" I never felt the maternal connection between her and Michael or even her ""biological"" son in the movie, S.J.. It never felt authentic. As Linda Schell in Daldry's film, Bullock finally hits all the right chords and delivers probably one of her finest and sensitive performances in her career. Bullock nails every note, nuance, and depression with utter ease and like a pro. Though not a whole lot of scenes to chew on, Bullock uses every moment and makes it count.Max Von Sydow's mute work is Oscar worthy... Max Von Sydow as the mute and mysterious ""Renter"" is perfectly controlled and beautifully executed. As much needed balance to an otherwise heavy, emotional film, Von Sydow uses his most effective tools in his acting arsenal to convey a character that is easily written off as mute but feels like he's screaming off the paper's he writes on. It's an Oscar worthy turn that voters should be recognizing. Tom Hanks, in his short time with the audience captures the essence of his charisma that used to work for him so well in the 90′s with films like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Forrest Gump."" I've missed Tom Hanks at his peak. There's a hole in Hollywood still for someone to fill that spot once occupied by Hanks as the most dependable and charming actor to grace the screen (And no, it's not George Clooney). As Thomas Schell, Hanks illuminates the paternal light in all of us and magnifies the power of loss by two. When Oskar loses him, we feel as though we've lost him as well. That's Hanks using his tactics effectively. And don't sleep on the talented Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright who for seconds punch through the screen and into your theater seat. They show up and they show up well. A beautifully blended score by Alexandre Desplat evokes the essence of the film and elevates moments into wonderful blips of mastery. Desplat is one of our finest composers hitting the screens film after film. With a great year for this, ""The Tree of Life,"" ""The Ides of March,"" ""Carnage,"" ""A Better Life,"" and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,"" if he doesn't have a statue by the end of the year, criminal prosecution should be taken on the Academy. Eric Roth's screenplay is very resourceful and completely believable is an otherwise un-believable story. He paces the emotional rifts the story entails and doesn't hit while you're down. He builds the story, giving us character development, and showcasing the bare bones of a broken family. Daldry's direction isn't as prominent as it's been in his other films but it's completely acceptable. I don't feel it's his place to his own directing style on for show. He lets Roth, Horn, Hanks, Von Sydow, and Bullock develop and evolve the stylistic quality into a masterpiece theater segment. ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" bookends in what seems to be the theme of the year, silence in film, and breathes a breath of fresh air into the cinematic souls.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
83,PeachHamBeach,Worthy member of good 9/11 themed films,8,14 September 2013,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Spent the 12th anniversary of 9/11 watching or rewatching movies whose theme centers around it.Let me first start by saying that this movie is a bit long. It drags just a bit in some places. But other than that, it's a wonderful story about ""the worst day"" in USA history. Up until Sept. 11, 2001, the worst day most Americans could recall was the day of the assassination of JFK. The whole nation grieved over this single death. Nearly 40 years passed before a day came when thousands were killed and maimed and scarred for life by an act of pure evil.I also want to say that Thomas Horn is a very good young actor and I am not sure where the ""hate"" for his character is coming from. I didn't find the boy annoying or bratty in the least. Oskar is a child of above average intelligence and very fragile mental health after the trauma he suffered in losing his father (Tom Hanks). I thought Horn's performance was amazing!I was unclear about the significance of falling. Obviously the father was still inside Trade Center 2 when it collapsed before Oskar's eyes on live television, but we see several sequences of his father ""falling,"" first at the very beginning, and then in the middle, and represented within Oskar's log book of his recognizance mission to learn about the key his dad left behind.Sandra Bullock, Jeffrey Wright, Max Von Sydow and Viola Davis give wonderful supporting roles.A very beautiful and compelling portrait of lives forever changed by a tragic day.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
84,moviemanMA,Tough to swallow,7,2 February 2012,"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close tells the story of a family living in New York City post 9/11. Oskar and his mother Linda (Thomas Horn and Sandra Bullock respectively) are still coping with the loss of Thomas (Tom Hanks), Oskar's father and Linda's husband. He was the glue that kept the family together, and not that he is gone there is a giant void in both their lives. When Oskar stumbles upon a key, he sees is as one final contact with his father, one final game the two can play. What does the key fit? Where will it take him?Oskar is a unique child, both in his abilities and inabilities. He was once thought to have Asperger syndrome, a form of autism, though his tests were inconclusive. Regardless, he is a special boy with an imagination as lofty as lofty as his determination to find the elusive key hole for his father. With the help of his grandmother, grandmother's renter (Oscar nominee Max von Sydow), and the entire city of New York, Oskar journeys out into the unknown, hoping to come across the owner of the said key hole, but more so to find out where his father's final game will take him.This film should come with a warning along with the MPAA's rating. THIS FILM WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR EMOTIONS. It's really not fair at times. A boy with Aspergers loses his father on 9/11 who is played by Tom Hanks, whom EVERYONE loves. The child's mother is played by Sandra Bullock, another of America's sweethearts, throw that on top of a very intense story about love, loss, and self discovery, you've got one heavy emotional cocktail.I do think this film hits below the belt a few times, but overall I was impressed with the story. It wasn't so much about finding closure for the death of his father, this was a story about a city still reeling from a tragic event. This boy risks a lot going out into the city, greeting strangers to find out if they knew his father or not, only to discover that there is a good in every person, including himself. He was bringing comfort to their lives, be it a shoulder to cry on or a voice to laugh with, he was there.Horn, Bullock, and Hanks offer up pretty solid performances. Sydow, who received an Oscar nod for the voiceless Renter, gives a nice performance, but I don't know if it was more worthy than say Albert Brooks in Drive or Andy Serkis in The Adventures of Tin Tin. Regardless it's still a great character and offers another angle to the story of Oskar and his father. Horn and Bullock really lock horns in this film, spewing some shocking revelations.Director Stephen Daldry has a knack for tackling some tough issues. His last two films, both of which garnered Best Picture nods (The Reader and The Hours), ventured into the Holocaust and suicide. Where these films differ is with the characters. They both had very deep, complex characters, which in Extremely Loud the characters are more confused that anything else, or we can't understand as in Oskar's case. Daldry isn't shy to hold punches, but his punches here seemed a little too harsh and more consistent. It wasn't totally abusive but it came close.It's a tough movie to get through for some more than others, but for those who can handle the subject matter they have the most to gain from watching.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

So he sets out on a mission to find what the key fits, meeting many different people along the way. Review: Late last month the Academy posted it's nominees for the 84th annual academy Awards. They had nine best picture nominees including this film. This surprised and even angered many people because the film has a 46 percent rating on rotten Tomatoes. I ingnored that, after all I didn't like The Hurt Locker, and that was critically praised. So I watched this film and, it was good. It's not an outstanding movie, it probably didn't deserve to be nominated for best picture, but it deserved it more than the Tree of Life.Most of the bad stuff about this film can be summed up with the fact that this film tries way, way too hard. There are some parts that are so pretentious that it just feels awkward. The film is also a little too long, just a little bit, but there were some scenes that I felt they could've cut, there were a few too many times where I felt bored.The kid who played Oskar is a mixed bag for me, sometimes he was good, sometimes he was bland.But for the most part this film worked well enough. When it was meant to be sad I was pretty sad. When it was meant to be happy I was happy. When it was supposed to be funny I chuckled. Yeah, this film has comedy in it, where were you on that one Unbreakable. I liked the characters. And the fact that Oskar's dad died on 9/11 doesn't feel like it was put in just for shock value.Go into the movie with an open mind. I liked it, but I don't plan on watching it again.

86,scottshak_111,"Extremely loud, incredibly close and Extraordinarily profound",8,30 September 2013,"I was blown away by the intensity of the misery the family portrayed in the flick had to face. 9/11 was one of the most tragic events in the history of mankind. The adverse aftermath on a child, whose father was his hero, also a victim of 9/11, was captured and narrated beautifully. It is so touching that I cried throughout the movie. The evanescent presence or rather the prolonged yet moving absence of Tom Hanks was so shattering that it would break me into tears every now and then. Moments when Sandra Bullock would try her level best to speak to her son while the recalcitrant and tenacious lad would retort bluntly was indeed disheartening. There was this time when both Sandra and Thomas really connect and share what they miss the most about Tom. It was subtly written and extremely warm. Also the time when Thomas Horn breaks, after narrating his biggest secret which he carried with him forever depicts how frustration, angst and misery really look like. Excellent acting by Thomas Horn as well. He runs to his house and destroys everything he ever created. He cries like a boy who has lost everything. So unfortunate and yet so powerful. It really makes your heart heavy.There is something about Tom Hanks that really connects to you. If he is a father, he becomes very gentle and caring and maybe the best dad in the entire world. If he plays a lover, he becomes adorable and lovable instantly. He just knows how to do it right.I think you must watch this flick if you are really sad.

You'll enjoy this film a lot, but you'll need an extra box of tissues. Thomas Horn plays a nine-year-old autistic child, whose father, portrayed by Tom Hanks, has always been a life-long friend to him, spending hours and hours together on explorations and projects, so they were really close. After his father's death on 9/11, and being left with his heartbroken mother, portrayed by Sandra Bullock, Oskar goes into his father's closet, and finds a key with a name on it, the word ""Black"". With a tambourine on his side, Oskar goes on a desperate mission, trying to find the owner of the key, with the name ""Black"", and see if it contains a message from his deceased father. Yeah, I know this movie was extremely ignored and incredibly mixed by critics, saying that the depressing scenes make you feel so bad, and the running time was too long to develop. But I think you should forget that baggage, and respect this movie for what it really is. This is a heartwarming journey through the eyes of one's perspective in life. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are still brilliant, but Thomas Horn is the star performer, and I hope this movie will lead him into more movie projects sometime soon. Max Von Sydow is also excellent in an Oscar-nominated role, playing a completely deaf man who communicates with a notepad, and two tattoos on his palm saying ""Yes"" and ""No"". This remarkable cast also includes Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, and Zoe Caldwell. I was really touched by how this movie was meant to be made. The story is worth telling, but I think this movie was too much depressing for me, that I actually felt like wanting to kill myself (but not really!). ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" may have it's negative aspects, but this is still a beautiful film that only smart directing, great acting, and a wonderful script can be accomplished. You will enjoy this wonderful film as much as I did. But again, bring out the tissues.

89,Ramascreen,Extremely powerful and incredibly well-made,9,28 December 2011,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --9/11 is a touchy subject, no matter how well-made the films are, like United 93 and Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, for example, there will always be a certain level viewing discomfort and questions of whether or not it's too soon for such depictions to exist. EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE is no different but I think screenwriter Eric Roth and Oscar nominated filmmaker Stephen Daldry, whose film The Hours I admired, manage to approach this adaptation in a respectful manner from the perspective of the young character Oskar as he struggles through the difficulties of letting go the memories of his dad who was in one of the towers when they collapsed on what he'd like to call 'the worst day'Heart-wrenching, life-affirming, hopeful, at times aggressive but in the spirit of self-healing, EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE will press your buttons and get on our nerves, you'll either be irritated by the character Oskar and you'll want to to walk out of the theaters, or you'll find away to come to understand him. Newcomer Thomas Horn, the actual young winner of Jeopardy game show, proves that not only is he smart at countless subjects, he's also got the chops for acting. Horn gives an extraordinary performance, Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks are some of the backbones of this film's emotional power. And one of cinema's treasures, Max Von Sydow says so much by not saying a single word. He's a screen legend who's still got it.Because Oskar has a condition called Asperger's syndrome, as soon as he focuses on one thing, he'll focus on it so much, everything fades away and he'll insist on that one thing for as long as he could hold on to it. He interprets the world differently, he speaks out facts and information. His relationship with his dad is built on his dad's knowing how to connect with him. Oskar feels that he has to try to be normal, but both his parents see him as perfect and he receives that signal much stronger from his dad. But the film is not about Asperger's syndrome or autism, nor it is about the incident/tragedy either, that's only the foundation, 9/11 is the backdrop. EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a loss-related film through the eyes of someone whose fears and anxieties are just like everyone else's when we deal with grief, but Oskar openly expresses those fears, there's no filter to it if you will, he lets it all out, something that the rest of us probably would need years of therapy to finally be able to do the same.What I've always admired about screenwriter Eric Roth (The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button), who won Oscar for adapting my favorite film of all time, Forrest Gump, is that when it comes to working on adaptations, he knows which changes he has to made appropriately and the goal that he always sets on his mind when goes about it is to always prioritize the relationships. Whatever changes he makes, from the original material, is always meant to strengthen the relationships of the characters.

91,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Genuine emotion but misses it's mark.,4,8 February 2012,"This wasn't nearly as bad as it should have been. There were some moments that felt like hardcore emotional manipulation (""I wish you were there"" being the main offender) but a lot of my emotional reactions actually felt genuine rather than exploitative. I thought that Sandra Bullock was very strong and was able to bring authentic emotion to the mother/son relationship, which I was very surprised by since I kind of loathe her as an actress.A lot of the supporting players gave very strong and heartfelt work, my favorites being her, Max Von Sydow and Jeffrey Wright. I think Thomas Horn did his best but a lot of the times that character felt a little too forced for me. I just don't think that the story should have been told with that kind of a main character, all of his quirks in his behavior were too much and bore down on the actual story and emotions more than they should have.I'm not sure how I feel about the whole...using the key thing as a narrative while using the emotions as 9/11 as a backdrop, thing. I don't think they ever exploited the tragedy, which surprised me, but I also don't think they did a good job of molding those things. I was honestly more interested in the mystery of where the key went to than I was about any of it's themes on loss and resolution. I don't think they were able to simultaneously capture the state of New York in the post-9/11 world while also dealing with the more intimate study of this one family. It didn't feel universal enough, which they were clearly going for.Stephen Daldry is a director who can very easily be a major visual stylist (as seen primarily with The Hours) but I admire his semi-restraint in this one. Instead of focusing on making it a visual feast he instead lets it be about the characters and their journey. There are a few moments where he does turn on his expected moves (the scene where Oskar goes through all of his fears was unbearable) but they weren't nearly as frequent as I would have expected from him. I'm not going to lie and say that I was ever actively interested in what was happening on screen, but I have to admit that I was never bored by it either. I was always engaged to some level, just not as much as one would hope from any film.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

93,brenttraft,9/11 Through the Eyes of an Autistic Child,8,26 January 2012,"""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is one of those films that has viewers divided. They either love it or hate it. I think the reason that a lot of people hate this film is that they do not realize the film is as much about autism as it is about the attacks on 9/11. The main character,Oskar Schell, is clearly autistic. Anyone with basic knowledge of ASD, PDD-NOS, and Asperger's Syndrome will spot the symptoms immediately. Oskar even says at one point that he was tested for Asperger's Syndrome but results were ""inconclusive."" He finds a key left in a vase owned by his father who died at the World Trade Center and spends the majority of the film looking for the lock that goes to the key. But really, he is looking to find closure with his relationship with his father and try to make sense of the events surrounding his father's death. This would be difficult for a neural typical child but it is especially difficult for an autistic child.""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is an impeccably made film with wonderful performances. I think the reason many people resent this film is because of their intolerance and ignorance about autism.While the film is centered around the tragic events of 9/11, it is primarily about how those events are interpreted through the innocent eyes of an autistic child. If you have an understanding and tolerance of autism, you are probably more likely to enjoy this film than people who do not. 2011 was an unusually weak year for films. Considering the competition this year, I think ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is deserving of it's Oscar nomination.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
94,Chris_Pandolfi,A Boy and His Mystery Key,7,26 December 2011,"Stephen Daldry's ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" represents the best type of sentimentalism there is, in which the aim is not to make you cry but to actually tell a story that will resonate emotionally. It's not a fairy tale, a fable, or a parable; it's simply a film that works more on the heart than it does the brain. I don't always appreciate narrative contrivances, but in this case, I have to admire Daldry and screenwriter Eric Roth – and, of course, Jonathan Safran Foer, who wrote the novel on which the film is based – for their willingness to be so bold and uncompromising in their vision. They certainly deserve credit for respectfully incorporating the events of September 11, 2001 into the story. It was an awfully big risk for them to take, and they pulled it off. That's because 9/11 isn't the main focus. It's merely the backdrop.The film freely goes back and forth through time, telling the story of a ten-year-old boy named Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who doubles as the narrator. He mentions at one point that he was tested for Asperger's syndrome, although the results were inconclusive. Whatever condition he does or does not have, it's obvious his mind is wired differently. He's a catalogue of obscure facts and figures that are narrowly focused. He's highly neurotic, his list of phobias ranging from tall buildings to bridges to loud noises to things made of concrete. He has a hard time approaching strangers and speaking to them directly. He mentally counts his own lies. The only person he could communicate with was his father, Thomas (Tom Hanks), who aspired to be a scientist but ended up becoming a jeweler. He turned every situation into an archaeological and historical exploration. Well aware of Oskar's difficulties, he would stipulate that things were not worth doing if they were easy.After Thomas' death on 9/11 (he was in one of the towers of the World Trade Center), Oskar is thrown for a loop. His is a world of logic, organization, and structure, and yet nothing about his father's death makes sense – not even his funeral, in which an empty coffin was buried in a cemetery. He almost never refers to the day by its date; mostly, he calls it The Awful Day, which is as good a name for it as any. He's left with his mother, Linda (Sandra Bullock), and although she's a loving woman, the two simply can't communicate. The situation is made harder because, naturally, she too is grieving Thomas' loss. Even after a year, things just aren't coming together. How can he come to terms with this? Perhaps the answer lies in his father's closet, which has been left untouched and which Oskar hasn't entered since The Awful Day. He accidentally knocks over a vase, in which contains a tiny manila envelope with the word ""black"" written on it. Within the envelope is a key.Obviously, the key fits into a lock. But which lock? And what does ""black"" mean? Oskar correctly assumes that it's actually a person's family name. With the help of his apartment building's security guard (John Goodman), with whom he trades foul-mouthed insults, Oskar is given access to several New York City phone books. He systematically determines that there are over 400 people in the area with the name Black. He then calculates the time it will take him to meet them all, factoring in his walking speed, the hours he searches on any given day, and the average time it will take to talk to them (around two minutes or so). Once he begins his journey, using a tambourine as a way to keep him calm, he quickly realizes that no one is on the same schedule he's on. Many want to tell him their life story. Others simply don't care. In any case, he takes a picture as a record of the meeting.Most of the people he meets are not examined in depth, which is fair enough given the amount of time it would take. There are, however, two notable exceptions. One is a man who's name isn't even Black. In fact, his name isn't given at all. He's a reclusive, mysterious old man from Germany (Max von Sydow), who rents an apartment from Oskar's grandmother, also a German immigrant (Zoe Caldwell). The old man, known only as The Renter, has been so psychologically scarred that he can no longer speak. He writes longer sentences in a notebook; for simple answers, he lifts his hands, one palm tattooed with the word ""yes"" and the other with ""no."" He joins Oskar in an effort to help him, despite the boy's rigid rules. The other person is Abby Black (Viola Davis). I will refrain from describing their first meeting, for I don't want to spoil too much of the plot. I will say that, like much of the movie, the circumstances aren't very likely.But then again, that's not the way melodrama works. The intention is to provoke an emotional reaction, not to have you analyze the logistics of a situation. And provoke a reaction it did; by the end of the film, I was clutching a tear-stained tissue. I allowed myself to be so vulnerable because it was obvious that a story was being told. Had ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" been just a strung-together series of dramatic situations, had there been no context, it would only be manipulation. Having said this, I anticipate a divisive reaction, with some audiences finding it incredibly touching and others finding it unbearably cloying. Some may even think it's in poor taste. A negative reaction is understandable, although I hope you see your way to giving the film a chance. Although it works entirely in sentiment, its plot is engaging and the characters are compelling.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

96,Ryan_MYeah,"What a way to finish the year in such high, underrated fashion.",8,17 February 2012,"What a way to end the year in such high fashion. Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, an undeserved target of critical resentment, is my vote for the most underrated movie of the year.I'm not the biggest fan of director Stephen Daldry, having loved The Hours, but disliking The Reader, and having not seen Billy Elliot. His direction uses the editing and sound mix in creative ways, as it puts us inside the mind of Oskar, our main character. The film hints that he has Asperger syndrome, a form of autism spectrum disorder. For this reason, I actually find Daldry's direction fascinating and personal to me, partly because I have my own history of autism. The film touches on his obsession with completing a single task, his sensitivity to certain noises, and even a bit of social awkwardness. In quite a few ways, I could actually find myself relating to Oskar. I will say that the film occasionally treads close to exploitation, and Oskar's narration sometimes feels superfluous, but these things thankfully didn't destroy my investment.Thomas Horn, despite having NO acting experience prior to the film surprisingly manages to carry his own as Oskar. Even if Oskar feels mean-spirited at times, the movie at least tries to help us understand how all of the events in the film are making him feel. During the movie, we join him on a journey meeting a wide range of characters, including small, great supporting roles by Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, and Zoe Caldwell. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are superb and heartfelt as his parents. Special mention goes out to Max von Sydow, never uttering a single word, but saying everything his character needs to in spare written messages, simple ""Yes"" or ""No"" signals on his hands, or just by his powerful emotion in general.*** out of ****",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

It took three separate attempts to finish the movie and I was not impressed in the least. Except for Max Von Sydow there was nothing else worth watching. The story was long winded and bogged down, there was nothing impressive in the other actors and the constant foul and rude language by the child was detrimental to the film. The more the kid spoke, the more I despised his character and could not relate to his journey. John Goodman was wasted as the apartment building guard and it was ashame to see him stooping this low.

99,gregeichelberger,Extremely maudlin but incredibly uplifting conclusion,7,19 January 2012,"Getting through this film was an exercise in almost total frustration. You will have to sift through more than an hour of the the world's most annoying and whining protagonist before finally able to absorb the life-affirming denouement.So life-affirming, that on the way home from the theater, I phoned my wife just to tell her how much I love and care for her. ""That's sweet,"" she said, ""but I need you to pick up a couple of gallons of milk on the way home."" So much for pathos.Nevertheless, the newest Warner Bros. release, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"" will lead you in several different directions until, emotionally exhausted, you finally give in to director Stephen Daldry's (""The Hours,"" ""The Reader"") homage to the victims - and survivors - of the events of Sept. 11, 2001.Daldry, who was able to coax Oscar-winning performances from Nicole Kidman and Kate Winslet, doesn't seem much concerned about that here (although the lead, young Thomas Horn - in his debut after a stint on ""Kid's Jeopardy"" - has recently earned Golden Globe recognition for the meaty role of Osker Schell). The performances are more subtle and at once nuanced.In fact, veteran actor (and famed director Ingmar Bergman's favorite) Max von Sydow (the Renter) does not even speak, yet is absolutely mesmerizing during his time on the screen.Some, no doubt, will also compare this 9/11 picture to ""World Trade Center"" or ""United 93,"" but instead of retelling events about actual people, this story, based on a 2005 novel by Jonathan S. Foer, tells of a fictional - yet all too real - loss.And, unlike another Sept. 11 recollection, the heavy-handed ""Reign Over Me,"" there are no ridiculous Adam Sandler mood swings to sit through.Oskar, who may or may not be suffering from Aspberger's Syndrome (the current ""in"" malady for Hollywood types - see ""Joyful Noise""), is a smart-beyond-his-years 10-year-old who has a wonderfully close relationship with his father, Thomas (a very understated Tom Hanks). The two practice karate, play oxymoron word games and draw maps designed to locate New York's sixth borough (you know, like Queens, Manhattan, Statan Island and the like).This all ends, however, when one of four hijacked aircraft slams into the World Trade Center, where Thomas was attending a meeting. He made six phones calls to his home, each more desperate and heartbreaking than the last, until finally the structure collapsed, along with young Osker's world.It was hard enough for the boy when he had his father. He would not play outside or socialize much like other boys his age, and was completely obsessed with death, but now, he has totally shelled himself in and has become morbidly afraid of subways, buses and bridges. His no-nonsense grandmother (four-time Tony Award winner Zoe Caldwell) and fragile mom (Sandra Bullock, ""Blindside"") are no help, either.Finding a key while looking through his father's closet a year later, however, sends the young man on a quest to locate whatever it will unlock. The only clue is the word ""Black"" written on the envelope the key was in. Being sort of a geographical savant, Osker discovers there are over 400 Blacks in the New York area and then sets about visiting each one of them.Since he will not utilize public transportation, he has to walk everywhere. It's a journey, he calculates, that will take all of three years. He feels he needs to find the key's mate, though, so he does not lose his father forever (even though he realizes that he already has).He even allows a renter (Sydow) in his grandmother's flat to go with him one day. The man does not speak, but writes notes for the boy to read. He also persuades the headstrong Osker to slow down, take his time and ride the subway, cutting the search time immensely.The scenes are easily the most affective of the film. Osker, who is no day at the beach, is stubborn, arrogant, obnoxious, pretentious, a bully and overbearing in his one-note quest. His urgent need to find the mystery behind the key belays any sympathy one might feel for him. The old man, however, represents the audience, in a way, and when he stands up to the boy, we all breathe a sigh of relief.(And much of the audience's view of this film will depend on how much of Horn's (over) acting they are able to tolerate. For me, he came up just short of a grating, over-the-top performance that would have ultimately ruined the picture)Finally, Osker locates Abby (Viola Davis, ""The Help"") and William Black (Jeffrey Wright, ""Broken Flowers"") and the lad's entire motivation and perspective is altered. Thus, after almost 90 minutes, we finally get to see the soft, sweet side of this little boy, something he has kept deeply concealed until this heartbreaking conclusion that - finally - allows the sedated Bullock to really shine.Some will have a tough time putting up with the maudlin story and the boy's bellicose behavior for that long, though. At the screening I attended, several folks walked out rather than deal with it any longer.I would urge you to stay for the entire production, however. The road may be long and winding, at times, but it's worth it for the final revelations which bring the family (as well as those Osker has visited on his sojourn) together on such a high note it will be impossible not to share that special joy with a loved one.Even if you do still have to pick up milk on the way home.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The kid performing so brilliantly from the beginning and sorting out all the plans to go find the necessary things seemed weird to me, but later the film had to show so much that you would like to ignore a thing like this. It was a good story after all and made us emotional too. The basic theme of the film seemed to me as coping after the death of a loved one, which seemed genuine.

104,Christopher_Reid,Emotionally affecting but often frustrating,7,4 January 2014,"I found the main character very annoying at times. However, over time, this movie had enough touching moments that felt real and were gagné that in the end it was reasonably enjoyable.The best parts were the emotionally intense scenes of which there were several. The subject matter automatically lead in that direction. What was important was that they were handled well and weren't too obvious or sappy or preachy, IMO. I don't normally cry during movies and I didn't, but I can see how someone could and there's something healing in that. There doesn't need to be any explanation for a situation for us to learn from it. Simply seeing other people deeply affected by disturbing things can make you feel less alone and give you faith in humanity.People can argue and say nasty words and yet somehow communicate love at the same time through their body language. That brutal honesty that hurts the most usually comes from a very kind, sensitive place. It's interesting the kind of guilt we're capable of putting upon ourselves. The desperate fear that you're not a good person, that you failed somehow. You can relate to these characters and the way they feel. Death is one of those things that can be scary but which we often completely forget about. It's nice to have a primal emotion or fear brought alive by a movie in the right way.Now some major weaknesses. The plot is stupidly ridiculous. Much of it is technically possible but doesn't hold up well to inspection. It's too cute and ""clever"". I hate when characters go out on misguided missions without thinking them through. It's been done. It's far more interesting to have intelligent characters who run into legitimate or unexpected barriers than simply allowing them to forget all logic at the outset. The plot involves arbitrary devices for creating interesting situations rather than letting logical actions by the characters naturally take them somewhere interesting. It's like bad magic where you can see it all a mile away and there are no surprises.The boy's obnoxious and rude comportement were extreme and distracting at times. He was unlikable for long stretches. I can understand it in the context of him being deeply affected or lost or trying to cope with things, but it was still too much and the movie implied he was like that anyway because there was no contrast with his comportement before the events. Sounds like the book is much better in this regard. But it did affect me. Brought a little something out of me.

In this film: Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, Max von Sydow and (at times) Sandra Bullock. Even more astonishing is that in this film, von Sydow said nothing.The child's psycho-emotional situation added very little, at the expense of making the hero essentially unsympathetic. An example of the problem is that the child's guiltiest secret becomes something the audience can ascribe to the child's condition, rather than identifying with.And the ending seemed to me to be extremely contrived, with way too many nice touches.The film had some very nice scenes, but minus two or three of the actors I mentioned, this film would be rather disappointing.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Take a small slice out of it (or the aftermath), have some emotional tie, have the protagonist evolve. Keep focus, avoid montage. It works quite well in this regard. Sure, he went on a more or less literal journey so it was a little on the nose there, but it wasn't one we don't all encounter.

107,maximkong,"This is excellent! Remember, view this movie with the thought that rules imposed on normal kids does not work on him",9,18 November 2012,"Very early on there were more than enough hints given to tell you that the main character has some degree of autism, and this movie is a masterpiece in portraying that theme.I have read that people with Asperger are of very diverse symptoms, and Oskar probably has one that makes him extremely direct, annoying & unlikable in terms of his inability to understand feelings of others, so much that there was a scene where he just asks his mom to die instead.I can feel for him 100% as I myself am very direct and would find it difficult saying the right things through word of mouth without offending others. When Oskar lost a person who not only is his loved one but also probably the only person in the entire world that can understand him for who he is, the rest of the movie is in summary telling his struggle to get out of his worst enemies - loneliness or a lost of a sense of belonging (that there are no longer others that understand him) and frustration (expressed through a scene with the Renter).Even though that caused a deep strain in relationship with his mom, who tried but could not find ways to communicate to him and make him realize how much she cares for him, things are not what they seem, starting from a scene at the doorstep which was the first major emotional bomb.At first I was skeptical on the realism of certain things, e.g. how easily he was able to travel far and wide alone without his mom knowing and how easily he was accepted by strangers, but in the end everything made sense. Rules imposed on normal children cannot be applied to him. And the ending of the movie is magical, when his true feelings are expressed by a series of non-verbal communication instead of verbal, and his 8 minutes with his dad was being transfered to become 8 min with others he has touched, it became one of the best endings I have seen in a while.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
108,seaview1,A Boy's Quest in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,8,24 February 2012,"Ambitious in concept, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is the love story of a troubled boy whose bond with his father transcends death and events beyond his understanding. Director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott, The Hours) has put together an interesting study in post trauma and rediscovery. It doesn't always work, but it still registers on an emotional level.A funeral signals the death of a family member and a boy's alienation to the world. In flashbacks, Oskar (Thomas Horn), who has trouble communicating and may have Asperger Syndrome, adores his father (Tom Hanks) who challenges him with riddles and treasure hunts to meet people outside his apartment. Both father and mother (Sandra Bullock) are loving parents, and the world becomes an interesting laboratory for exploration and discovery. Life is idyllic until 9/11 when everything changes and Oskar is witness to his father's last moments trapped in one of the Twin Towers. A year later, looking in his father's closet, he discovers a key in an envelope with the letters 'black'. Who or what does the key belong to? Oskar sets out to find out by systematically tracking down every 'Black' in the phone book and visiting each person for a clue. This big scavenger hunt is at best a daunting task.His grandmother who lives across the street has a mysterious renter (Max Von Sydow) who does not speak and can only communicate by jotting on a note pad or displaying 'yes' and 'no' written on each hand. The renter takes a liking to Oskar and accompanies him on his quest. This is a search that proves overwhelming as each person they find has a story too. When all hope seems lost, the road leads back to that fateful September morning and opens Oskar to the truth about his parents and himself.At first you wonder if this hunt will be meaningful and be rewarded or if it is a waste of time. Oskar's obsession keeps him connected to his father; to fail is to lose whatever he has left of that relationship. In a way, it is about trying to make sense of his father's death and coming to terms with it. It is also about the forgiveness of guilt that nearly consumes Oskar.You kind of think that at some point a miracle may occur or that something profound may happen, but what does reveal itself does not quite answer all the questions, and maybe that's just the point to the film, that life is part mystery and we never truly understand its riddle.When you take stock of all the people that Oskar encounters, you realize that every one of them can sympathize or has suffered some kind of loss, and how they react to that in relation to Oskar shows how the trauma of loss can be a common bond. You wish you could learn more about some of these people.Von Sydow gives a memorable performance without uttering a word as the renter who has a personal, family secret. Why does he remain mute? Was he a survivor of something so traumatic like the concentration camps of Europe that he does not speak? In a supporting role, Viola Davis is effective playing a character who figures prominently at the beginning and the end.In the end, Oskar has learned something about himself and his family, and through his journeys, he has matured in a new post-9/11 world. Ultimately, the revelation at the end is bittersweet and that without the power of forgiveness, closure is incomplete. It also speaks to a part of humanity that we all share.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

His quirky, mercurial portrayal of Oskar Schell is amazing and impressive! He steals scenes from both heavyweights Hanks and Bullock throughout the film. As tedious as the actual plot to this film often is, I found myself fully enchanted by Horn's acting throughout. Max Von Sydow is also amazing as the ""Renter"" grandfather. I guess it was intended as symbolic that his character was unable to speak, but I could not help thinking that granddad could have offered some real-world sense for Oskar's quandary if he were not limited in this way. Instead, the script makes Oskar his moral superior and relegates his character to the dung heap of irrelevancy.This film for the most part amounts to one of those myopic touchy feely emotionally driven features that really annoy and frustrate those in the audience who are capable of consistent logical thought. Oskar's search for sense in the shadow of his father's death does not seem to yield much that is really helpful. I think most of us realized early on that searching for sense by undertaking a senseless quest makes no sense in the first place. But I think most audiences can appreciate the fact that Oskar's quest, while doomed to failure, is an effective catalyst in bringing him back to realizing that life is worth living despite its unavoidable tragedies and devastating losses.What annoyed me most about this film is its myopic pacifist perspectives. All the characters seem incapable of thinking about life outside the boundaries of sheltered urban America. All the characters are stuck in the ""violence is senseless"" mode. Actually, there is much sense that could have been offered to Oskar concerning what motivated the perpetrators of the acts of terror that claimed his father's life, but he would have needed to be able to think outside his sheltered pacifist perspectives, which blindly deny any recognition to essential human motives which have driven all of history since its inception. Sheltered American urban pacifism values nothing above personal peace and affluence; it can see nothing worth dying or killing for. Its most profound elucidation comes from Rodney King's mantra ""Why can't we all just get along?"" Denying that there are any valid reasons for not getting along, it can understand neither genuine outrage over historic injustices, nor any genuine need to use deadly force to protect the innocent from such outrage. Believing stubbornly in the basic goodness of all people and at the same time being entirely dependent upon the protection of those who are willing to resort to both self-sacrifice and deadly force when necessary, it is ostensibly useless in any real-world situation, perpetually wandering around in a passive stupor when confronted with the hard realities and violent evils of life.A good film, even if rather over-long and uneven. Well worthwhile if only for the acting of Thomas Horn and Max Von Sydow.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
110,palavitsinis,"A beautiful film, an amazing young actor!",7,29 September 2015,"I admit that this film has slipped my attention for too long. The other day I decided to watch it and it was really really interesting. On one hand you have all the drama and hardship depicted through the events of 9/11 which is still after all these years like a punch in the stomach. On the other hand you have a really sensitive and unique young man that apart from his other problems has to cope with the most serious family ""issue"" there is.His path through the movie is an amazing depiction of the consequences that such disasters or any other tragic event can have on the life of a family. This enormous impact that comes when a loved one perishes, has been the theme in many other movies, but still the way in which it's depicted here makes the movie stand out. The abrupt separation of the child from his father was really really hard to cope with. Overall, the cast and the acting were amazing. The script was somewhat predictable which could have been avoided a bit, but still it was not that unpleasant. I would like to have seen some more ""unexpected"" facts, although this is not the genre of movies that you expect that from. I would watch this movie on a Sunday afternoon, maybe followed up by another more joyful or relaxed, unless you can handle the intense drama.

111,Davalon-Davalon,What was the point?,2,21 May 2013,"I saw this movie several weeks ago. I had to let it process before I could make a comment on it. First, to all those on this site who have berated the movie in horribly blunt terms: To my knowledge, no one is holding you hostage. You could have left the theater, returned the DVD or turned off the TV. What is the big deal? Why do people say, ""I'll never get those two hours of my life back"" in reference to movies they didn't enjoy? This is their ""critique""? Sorry, had to get that off my chest. I did not find this movie ""boring,"" but I did find it disturbing. This movie asks us to believe that a woman who has lost her husband is willing to let her pre-teen boy (and a very pretty one, at that) go wandering around New York City whenever he damn feels like it. This was totally unbelievable to me. Next, we are to assume that not only the mother, but the grandmother (who the mother never interacted with once, which is also insane, considering they both lost someone of great importance), and the building manager/greeter never once stopped the boy from leaving the apartment on a whim. Even when the boy was hanging out with the grandfather (shh!! That's supposed to be a ""big surprise""), neither the mother nor grandmother seemed to be putting two and two together. Next, the child sees the name ""Black"" on the back of an envelope (that was in a bottle he broke) and ASSUMES it is the name of a person and therefore decides he's going to track down EVERY PERSON with that name in NYC. On what basis? The child, once he gets to these ""Black"" homes, then must take photographs of them. I'm sorry, under what circumstance would you let some strange child into your home, have him grill you for info, and then let him take a photograph? What's that? You wouldn't? Right. So, how is it that the filmmakers thought we would buy that? Next, Tom Hanks (the dad who dies in 9/11) is letter perfect. Doesn't have a fault. Loves his wife and his kid. Great; who cares? Yawn. NO ONE on this planet is that perfect. And also, other than Tom locking up tight, who on this planet would buy that he had a jewelry shop? I did not get any remote sense that he was a jeweler. The only thing I will say positive is: Although the boy was not a trained actor, the director essentially handed over the entire film to him. I think he did a fine job and people who were going on and on about how ""irritating"" he was -- that's who he was in the film. So what? Considering the weight on his shoulders, he carried off the film to the best of his abilities. Whether he will have a career after this, I don't know, but let's not condemn him just yet. Overall, a strange film that did not provide catharsis and ultimately seems to be pointless.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

And it will lead us into an incredibly deep and emotionally charged adventure.

A magisterial ""Max von Sydow"", despite his 85 years, still has so much presence on the screen.

The music of Alexandre Desplat is exceptional and makes even more power to this movie. When I read some of the criticisms, I was really surprised to see some of them being disdained for this wonderful movie, if a tear in a movie is bad, then these people are downright lacking in feelings.

At times during the film, you are thinking it's terrible, other times, it's touching, at others, inspiring. There is so much tragedy here and so much that is hopeful. I will say this, when the movie closed and the lights came up, I just sat there, thinking about things I'd seen, things I still wondered about, scenes that were perfect and those that weren't, questions that were answered and those not quite enough. Over all, I'd say I'm glad I watched this one. I can't say it's one I'm going to want to buy. It was interesting that of the four of us who went together to see this picture, all had different parts that affected us the most. For many of us, bringing ourselves to watch anything that had to do with 9/11 is still too painful to really be excited about. It's still too freshly seared into our minds. Maybe always will be. This one, at least, didn't slam the viewer over the head with too many visual details.there were as many as had to be, to present the movie. I think this is one you should see if only to decide for yourself what feelings you are left with. Excellent casting by the way.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
114,kekca,My rating: 8,8,16 September 2014,"It would not be fair to say that Tom Hanks saved the movie because seeing someone pretending to be so innocent, wounded and deeply shaken by the things that he does constantly, is not for everyone's eyes. Black and white hugging each other long forgotten their past quarrels. But it was not only Hanks the good thing about the whole movie.At times hysterical, frightening and haunting as Eminem's song, or by any tragedy, not only that of 9/11 (the date on which I remember clearly a sunny weekend me and my father we had opened the hood of our white Moskvich and were fixing something when my mother came out of the kitchen window and told us what happened - had not yet fallen the second tower, nor the third plane), but every other. At times positive and inspiring with hope. Affecting the subtle relationship between father and son and valuable relationships between people. The film is reminiscent of past events and makes us more humble looking in the near future.It reminds us to respect the different and to be such. To not brake the wings of our curiosity and dreaming. To treat children as adults! To forgive others and especially our self. To figure out the mysteries and set puzzles.

A precious child with a jarring voice that should be stopped, now! The intention of the director, Stephen Daldry, Eric Roth, the writer,yes, Eric Roth! Unbelievable! it's crystal clear. To build a tear jerker around the defining tragedy of 9/11. How appallingly dishonest. My only question remaining is: are audiences going to fall for this trick?

It has nothing to do with 9/11 but with the feeling of being lost, of losing someone you love and care, specially at such a young age. Thomas Horn did a fantastic job portraying a highly functional autistic and he really nailed it down to the details and manneurisms.

Do you simply give up and start the healing process or do you hold onto whatever's left with all you have?Without any explanation, we open on the funeral of jeweler, husband, and father Thomas Schell (portrayed in flashback sequences by Tom Hanks) but Oskar, his son (played by Thomas Horn) won't tolerate the formality of a funeral with an empty coffin and as firefighters and rescue workers were unable to find his remains among the wreckage of the World Trade Center, the symbolic burial was the only option available to Linda, Thomas's wife and Oskar's mother (played by Sandra Bullock). Still struggling, Oskar (Horn) goes to a closet filled with his father's things and, among them, finds a jacket with an envelope containing a key and the word ""black"" written on the outside. Where is the lock? What's contained inside? After exhausting easily available sources of information (e.g. the doorman in his building and the neighborhood locksmith) Oskar decides to launch a massive investigation of any listing with the name Black contained with the five boroughs of New York City. An undertaking that would be difficult enough on its own but made even more so by his many phobias and unusual personality traits. Some of which include carrying a tambourine as a form of stress ball and avoiding public transportation at all costs.Watching Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, I couldn't help but draw comparisons between it and August Rush, a 2007 film starring Freddie Highmore, Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. On the other hand, the receptions they received are complete mirror images. Audiences have not exactly embraced the former despite its Academy Award nomination while August Rush was generally maligned by critics and praised by audiences. That is the position I find myself in. To this day, I still watch my copy of August Rush while Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close just left me confused and otherwise dissatisfied.

118,bdgill12,The Most Frustrating Movie I've Ever Seen,4,30 January 2012,"I know that I'm quite prone to hyperbole. When describing a movie I've  used the terms ""best"", ""worst"", and ""favorite"" more than any man  should. I've tried to curb that desire over the last couple of years  and I now think long and hard before I jump off the hyperbolic ledge.  So when I say that Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is the most  frustrating movie I have EVER seen, please know that I do so after a  serious amount of consideration.   Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) is a troubled boy, stricken with a set of  social disorders (never defined in the film but readily apparent) that  only get worse when he experiences ""the worst day ever."" His father,  Thomas (Tom Hanks), was in the World Trade Center on 9/11 and died in  the building's collapse. The loss leaves Oskar struggling to make sense  of his life while his mother, Linda (Sandra Bullock), drifts further  and further away into depression. A year after the tragedy, while  snooping around in his father's possessions, Oskar discovers a  mysterious key labeled, ""Black."" Feeling that his connection to his  father is slipping away, Oskar postulates that the key must be a part  of one of the numerous adventures his father sent him on. With the help  of a mysterious mute (Max Von Sydow) who rents a room from his  grandmother, Oskar begins a cross-city search for the owner of the key  who he believes will be able to tell him something about his father.  The story contained within EL&IC is truly spectacular. It is equal  parts beauty and heartbreak, a haunting and yet triumphant narrative  that should draw a natural connection from its audience. Obviously the  9/11 overtones make up a portion of the emotion within the film but the  real value is found in Oskar's struggle to remain in touch with his  father and as a byproduct the distance from his mother. Make no  mistake, at times this story is gut-wrenchingly painful and difficult  to endure but at the core of the sorrow there remains hope, a  combination that elicited quite a response from me. When describing the  narrative to a friend I got choked up and nearly broke down, an action  that isn't typical for me (I'm a movie crier, sure, but I'm usually  done with it after the movie is over). I realized how deeply the story  had affected me after the fact, so to speak, and that's what makes this  such a frustrating movie: while the narrative is fantastic, virtually  everything else about this movie is a bloody mess.  Okay, to be fair, the acting of the supporting players isn't a mess.  Hanks is charming as always in his limited screen time and as the film  goes on, Bullock's character displays more depth than originally  expected. Von Sydow, too, makes every second of his wordless appearance  count, a performance worthy of his Oscar nomination. All of them,  however, are overshadowed by Oskar and I don't mean that in a good way.  Oskar is, quite simply, a beating for the majority of the film. The  fault does not belong with Horn, a young actor who does an excellent  job with what he was given to work with. The problem is that director  Stephen Daldry makes Oskar excruciatingly annoying in order to  illustrate his various ticks and issues. At times you want to ignore  all the stuff this kid has been through and just tell him to shut up.  Actually, it's not ""at times""; it's almost all the time. Oskar grated  on my nerves and Daldry's insistence on playing up his idiosyncrasies  essentially strips this film of its rightful impact. Add in a HORRIBLE,  painful voice-over that never seems to stop, a distracting and  obnoxious score, and a few truly bizarre production choices (a man  falling from the WTC building in disturbing detail, for example) and  what you've got is a sloppy, haphazard mess of a film that undercuts  the power of the narrative.  Numerous times over the last few years I've said that a given film  contains 20 minutes of a good film that can't quite escape the  trappings of mediocrity (or something to that effect). EL&IC is  different: it is 20 minutes of a GREAT film, an ICONIC film, that is  maddeningly handicapped by incessant and infuriatingly poor choices  from Daldry and his writing team. It is a frustrating and infuriating  cinematic experience that perfectly illustrates the term, ""what could  have been.""",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
119,StonedMagician,Below Average: 4.5,4,27 July 2019,"A film like this is one that I find to be unusually difficult to review. In certain ways, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is a truly great film, while little more than dramatic exploitation in others. I will attempt to break down this dichotomy as best I can, because I believe that is the only way I can fairly critique this movie. The film begins with a funeral for Oskar's (Thomas Horn) father (Tom Hanks). Oskar's anger at the lack of an occupant of the coffin is plain in his face and his voice. He clearly was incredibly distraught by his father's death in the 9/11 incident, and it is this emotion that fuels his almost-epic scale journey to find the answer to his father's last riddle. Oskar is very frequently depicted as being far smarter than most kids his age. He can recite seemingly random facts from the Encyclopedia Britannica and thinks of very creative solutions to puzzles (like using a rock as an object from every decade in the last century to solve one of his father's riddles). However, his ADHD (or something) leads him to being nervous around a rather large multitude of things, like moving vehicles, sloppy dentistry, and bridges. This of course being a bit of a debilitation, he apparently has shunned most human contact, making his very socially awkward. However, once his father is gone, he finds he must face his fears, to quote Max von Sydow's character in the film. Sandra Bullock portrays Oskar's mother. Oskar generally shuns her, blaming her for not dying rather than his father. Though it makes the kid come off as more than a bit cruel, it is genuinely powerful, especially once htey engage in an all-out shouting match. All the while, Oskar is trying to find what a key left behind by his father fits into. He ends up racing across most of New York in this quest. Of course, the idea that it might not be safe for a twelve-year-old to be wandering NY streets alone is never brought up. But, that doesn't matter that much. Back to the good stuff. The acting is very good. Every actor, be their parts high or low, does a great job with what they are given. von Sydow, Hanks, Horn, and Bullock are constantly vying for the spotlight, as each one of them could easily steal it on their own. The acting carries the film, and it's good for the movie that it does, because this film would be sort of unremarkable otherwise. What drags this film down is it's manipulative tendencies. At every single opportunity, it gives you an excuse to feel bad for Oskar. However, this happens so often that you eventually become desensitized to it. Oskar starts the film talking far too much, babbling on even while his partner in conversation is walking away from him. Even though he establishes that he is not the most sociable person, the fact that he is scared speechless by a conversation and so many other things makes him seem to alternate between smart and stupid. Ultimately, though its heart is in the right place, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close tries way too hard to be a frequent tearjerker. At first it works, but the impact is lessened over the course of the film enough so that by the end, you struggle to really care.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
120,Cinnyaste,"Much Maligned, Yet Worthy",7,8 February 2012,"Some reviews of ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" are scathing: 9/11 Porn; what were all these smart people thinking; kid is annoying; etc. These reviewers malign a good film; their criticism mostly unfounded. This is not the 9/11 film, but is a 9/11 film.Perhaps a New Yorker's first hand knowledge of 9/11 makes a difference: losing a friend; dusty, unclaimed cars in Long Island Rail Road parking lots; long afterward grim faces on NYC streets, everywhere.""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" is bold in not holding back in worry over upsetting viewers. The photos of jumpers and the father's last messages cut right to the soul. Daring is called upon for viewers.9/11 was a horrific day during which people died violently, including one boy's father. The boy is brilliant yet unable to easily form relationships. The father recognized the gap and pushed his son to get out of his own head through solving riddles and engaging strangers. This is the story. Chafing at the son is beyond ridiculous. There is never a moment of impatience with him. He's a good kid carrying a heavy burden of guilt and grief. We're invited to join him on a journey to discover the lock matching a key his father left, but never knew existed. And that journey is heart wrenching and engaging.It is difficult to watch this film - the main reason for such awful reviews. People tend to keep band-aids on a wound rather than experience the momentary pain of removal for true healing. Over ten years later, as a nation, a world, we're ready to move on. Films like ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" are part of that process.Sociological relevance aside, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"" as a film, suffers from flat performances by Ms. Bullock and, particularly, Mr. von Sydow (whose Academy Award nom is a 'gimmee' for a lifetime of spectacular performances - this is not one of them). On the other side of the see-saw is an amazing Mr. Horn as the son. Mr. Hanks strives too much for a Father-of-the-Year award in his performance; a bit more restraint should have been applied.""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" is a good film, not great.

124,DJRMewzique,An emotional insult.,3,24 January 2012,"""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture today...and all that says is that if you make a contrived film surrounding 9/11, you too could get an Oscar nomination.Stephen Daldry's cinematic interpretation of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel has very little going for it besides an excellent performance by Sandra Bullock and Viola Davis as the rest of the film is nothing more than a vehicle to try to manipulate tears from the viewing audience....tears that certainly never came close to bubbling up for me.Thomas Horn plays Oskar, a boy who loses his father on that fateful September day only to find a key a year later...a key that he is sure will lead to a message from his father. And thus, the adventure begins...as he goes tracking down clues and randomly being let into people's homes...in New York City...and then managing to take their photograph with a camera that is practically an antique and developing the photos one by one, all while his mother stands aside clueless.Yeah...right. That all seems plausible. And thus, yet another film with high expectation fails to deliver.Horn is the focal point of the film and is supposed to be the emotional driving force yet all this kid does is overact terribly and make the character of Oskar seem almost maniacal. He is irritating on every level and spurred absolutely no emotion in me at all except annoyance. As the film continues on, with the sole intent of rousing emotion through memory, the film just gets more and more blatantly insulting as the scenes which are supposed to make you well up just peel back the many layers of emotional manipulation.Even the strong performances of Davis and Bullock do not hold this film together. And then there is Max von Sydow who just garnered an Oscar nod in the Best Supporting Actor category. Why? I am really and truly not sure. While there was a sweetness to his limited performance, it is hardly anything to write home about. So, I'll credit this nomination to ""we better do it now or it may be too late."" Tom Hanks?

It suffers from the same problem as Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lovely Bones. Lots of attention to style but the end result is plastic and manipulative. And let me qualify that criticism by saying that I do enjoy tear-jerker/feel-good emotional films. But there is an art to it. For all the criticism about Spielberg, he can actually make that kind of thing work. But from the beginning of ELIC you feel the manipulation. It's cloddish. It's like those late night 'save the children' promos where they try to tear your heart out with images of doe-eyed third world kids. At least the promos serve a good purpose. For all it fumbling attempts at poignancy, I am not even sure what ELIC was trying to say. And the score is extremely overbearing for being so incredibly bland. Generic and ineffective. I have not read the book, but I was left with the feeling it is probably excellent, just like the novel of Lovely Bones. I read that after seeing the film version because I could tell there was a good story buried under Jackson's superfluous CG cosmetics. ELIC has a good source story too. But it is also handled poorly. I saw this film under invitation from a friend at the Director's Guild, and I am really glad it was for free.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
126,TroyeEvans,Deeply Sentimental and Utterly Inspiring,5,6 February 2012,"A simple story and a long journey characterize ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"", but if you are expecting masterful storytelling and a well-organized plot with a natural flow, this may not be your cup of tea. This is a movie that prevails on emotions, on its inspirational and sentimental messages that connect with the audience, especially the ones who have lost something in the 911. It's easily the most touching movie of the year for people who love it. If you don't like it, well, the score explains it.Nevertheless, Thomas Horn (Oskar) becomes the star of the movie the moment the film begins, and he learns and reflects through his adventure, till the very end of the movie when he realizes the truth and the message from his father. The performance is a completely Oscar-worthy one, and from what I'm seeing here I can easily put it on the level of George Clooney in ""The Descendants"", or even above.""Extremely Loud"" is presented in fragments, and some may find it confusing and somewhat pretentious. I see it as a way to display the emotions and the development of Oskar better. So it seems the critics are wrong this time, and I'm glad the Academy has corrected such a mistake by nominating this as Best Picture. Though it won't win, it certainly has received the recognition it deserved. Like ""The Help"", this is one the most moving movies of the year, but ""The Help"" seems to appeal to the audience more with its more conventional and linear storytelling technique. But for me, they are equally touching and are movies that can easily make people cry. I would even say the message in this is much stronger and enforced than the one in ""The Help"", which makes use of an issue that has been done over and over again.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
127,TheMovieSnob247,Oscar bait that ultimately falls flat,4,13 May 2012,"So I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into this. The reviews for it were fairly bad but it got nominated for an Oscar, so I figured it was worth a shot; it couldn't be that bad.The story is about a child who's father died during 9/11. A year later he finds a key in his father's closet and he then begins a quest throughout NY to figure out what the key opens. This story sounds very noble and poetic right? Except that it isn't executed very well. As the film progressed, I found the plot more and more implausible. While the second half does have some strong moments, it wasn't enough to redeem the film as a whole. Watching this felt like a chore and that's never good.I think the film lost me in the first half as I found the child actor to be very annoying and pompous (even considering the fact he lost his father, it was still really over the top). The supporting characters were mostly overly emotional and dramatic, except Max Von Sydow who gave a subtle, yet strong performance and was the sole bright spot of the film for me. At the end of the day, most of the emotional moments didn't really resonate for me and felt forced. Given that's more or less the goal of the film, it was disappointing.Overall I found the film to be a little depressing, very boring, manipulative and a bit too long. The ending wasn't satisfying at all and it felt like the story didn't really go anywhere. It's Best Picture nomination was completely undeserved and it should have gone to a film like Shame, Drive or A Better Life. Take a pass on this one, not worth watching.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/ @the_movie_snob",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I avoided it for three years then, swayed by positive reviews, decided to give it a go tonight. First the good points:Thomas Horn is very good. Max von Sydow is excellent.But other than that, I just don't get it. I'm always slightly unnerved by screen depictions of kids with Asperger's syndrome. It seems too often to be used as a cheap trick: ""We can have them being hilariously rude to people... but then very sweet as well! And - get this - we get bonus points at the Academy for portraying a mental illness"". What's really unsavoury about this film is how they stick in all the Hollywood-friendly aspects of Asperger's, but then completely sidestep accusations of misrepresenting the condition by saying ""the tests were inconclusive."" That's having your cake and eating it right there. The self-harming scene is particularly cynical. Once we get past the ""edge"" of the main character, all we're left with is a whole pile of cloying Oscar bait. And yes I know it's an almost impossible job, but the fact that overdubbed tambourine was just not quite right really grated on me like you wouldn't believe!

After the film ended I was so touched and I couldn't help but pondering how everything in life has its purpose, even tragedies. We all go through some sorts of pain and suffering, so many times we struggle so hard to find something that we think must be the answer, but then in the end it is the journey that we take that is the answer, not the destination. Love is always there for us to find if we open our eyes, face our fear, and accept the suffering that life has given to us and then move on. I watched this film and somehow I felt that all of us, everyone on earth, are connected somehow. I also felt that life is one Great Love hidden in many forms of tragedies, hidden in the faces of strangers and the faces of people close to us whom we sometimes overlook. If we step past that fear, past that extreme moment of sorrow and anger, then life will become beautiful again, even more beautiful than before, in a different way, in a better way.All that I want to say about this picture is that...please watch it. And if you feel annoyed by the boy's rude and arrogant manner, please understand that this is his disorder and he suffers very much for being that way. This film has great cast, wonderful script, and beautiful camera work. I'm glad I chose to watch it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
131,socialmedia-437-956449,Left wishing for more... and a bit less,5,15 August 2012,"In the decade since the events of September 11, 2001, American film-makers have struggled to dramatize the events of that day. A variety of approaches have been taken, ranging from Oliver Stone's clarion call to patriotism, ""World Trade Center"" to the documentary style re-enactment of ""United 93"". Like a number of films released about the war in Iraq, all have proved unpopular with the American public. It is easy to conclude why – footage from the day casts a long shadow across TV news and the online media. Viewers don't need reminding.Based on a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"", begins a year after the attacks on New York. Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), a lonely but gifted 11-year-old who may have Asperger's, is clinging to the memory of his father Thomas (Tom Hanks), a jeweler, who died in the World Trade Center. Hanks appears generously in flashback throughout the film, always disclosing a series of life lessons to the young boy. We learn that before he died, Thomas Schell also left six messages on the family answering machine. Oskar has kept the voicemails from his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) by switching machines.Searching through his father's closet one day, Oskar accidentally breaks a blue vase and discovers an envelope marked ""Black"", containing a key. Taking a phone book, he decides to look up 472 individuals called ""Black"" in the New York area – if he can find a lock for the key, he presumes he can find answer to his father's death.In less experienced hands, this could all prove to be dangerous territory, but Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot"", ""The Hours"" and ""The Reader""), is a confident director, working from a script by Eric Roth. He focuses on Oskar's mission to connect with his father one last time. The boy, wielding a tambourine and wearing a backpack, sets off to intrude on an array of New Yorkers. Along the way, he encounters a group of religious devotees, horse lovers, Abby Black (Viola Davis), and her soon to be ex-husband William (Jeffrey Wright). Most of them are surprisingly welcoming to a boy who turns up unannounced, bangs on a musical instrument, and proceeds to tell them, in a jumble of grown up sentences, about how he found the key, and how they might provide an answer to his father's death.None of this is plausible, of course. And I found ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" took a manipulative approach to Oskar's grief, despite a moving performance by Horn. With all due respect, how can we feel sympathy for a precocious young boy who sees himself at the center of the universe? The film takes another wild turn when Oskar, depressed by the scale of the task ahead, looks to his grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) and her live-in lodger (Max Von Sydow) for help. The latter, who may be Oskar's grandfather, refuses to talk and communicates by holding up his palms, on which he has written ""Yes"" and ""No"". For longer conversations, he uses a notepad. At this point, the audience may wish Tom Hanks had imparted one more valuable lesson to his son before he died: sometimes, children should be seen and not heard.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

One day, when he is looking through his dad's (Tom hanks) closet, he finds a mysterious key and has the name ""Black"" on it. He looks around his town for a person that has the name ""Black"" to see what this key opens to and to see why this has anything to do with his Dad. Now i thought this movie was pretty good. It was very slow at times and really boring at times but a very good solid movie. In this movie, I didn't really know if the performances were good or bad because Sandra Bullock (who plays the mom) and Tom hanks were barely in the movie. But Max Von Sydow was great by not talking.The movie focuses on towards Oscar Schell. (Thomas Horn) The boy's acting was pretty solid for a person who has never acted before. But he was very annoying at times and got in my nerves. I didn't really like Thomas Horn in the movie because he kept screaming right on the camera and just raised his voice and was very bad.

I really am not the person to fall for these sentiment types of movies.. Its just this ordinary story that is made extraordinary. Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), aged nine in the book, 11 in the film, is a prodigiously intelligent, solemnly serious New Yorker, a pacifist, a vegan, a technical whizz kid, and articulate in a manner that would have Peter Mark Roget applauding. His father, Tom (Tom Hanks), is a scientist who turned to selling jewellery as a way of giving his family a good life, and died on the morning of 11 September 2001 on a business visit to the twin towers, an event always referred to by Oskar as ""the worst day"".",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

So too many of us can relate to Linda, a mother fiercely trying to connect to her ever distant son. Most of all this movie is about reconciliation. Merriam-Webster defines reconcile as 'to restore to friendship or harmony (reconciled the factions)'. Oskar needed to bring harmony back into his life and in so doing he shared his life story with complete strangers who in some way needed his story to bring harmony to theirs.

The paradox (and my mixed feelings about the film) is thus: the novel is an honorable failure, in my humble opinion, as it does go all over the place without any easy connection for the reader to make. Maybe novels should make you sweat, true enough, only to make you reflect. However the author breaks the rhythm so often, brings so many disparate POVs that the reader (yours truly included) feel that the author is missing something, that Foers has it all meaningfully arranged in his mind but is incapable to convey meaning in the printed word (well, a bit like an autistic person; I for one am the father of a kid with special needs, so I know what it feels like). However all the ingredients are there: three generations affected by war events, traumatized by separation, seemingly unable to establish a so-called normal human relationship (except Oskar's dad, to an extent). These are elements that should have been included, to a limited degree, into the movie. For instance, the grandfather's own background story, slightly more defined in the book and peppered in the film with Oskar as the focus, could have brought so much more to the understanding of the traumas suffered by all. As it is, we are left with little else than uninteresting coincidences. This being said, yes, I loved the movie and, yes, it brought me to read the book. My contradictory feelings are that although the book goes all over the place, it did contain the basic elements to expand on Oskar (and his grandfather or the renter), elements which could have been brought forth and used into the movie. The film streamlines the book and the narrative, true, but leaves us with a meaningless skeleton.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

140,MC1-Bjornson,Extremely...Extremely ...,6,15 February 2012,"""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" (2011), Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language and Thematic Elements. Running Time: 2hrs.&9mns.My Take **1/2 (out of ****) Like ""Hugo"" (2011), ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" tells the story of an adolescent who loses his father to a horrible tragedy and then seeks a special message from him from beyond the grave to cope with the loss. Coincidentally, both films are contenders for the Best Picture Oscar on Sunday, Feb. 26, 2012 (which is 1.5 week(s) away from this writing).The film centers around the high functioning Oskar (Thomas Horn). He's a brilliant child lacking in social graces. It is observed he may have Asperger's syndrome which makes sense given his erratic behavior.Oskar's father Tom (Tom Hanks, ""Larry Crowne"") knew Oskar to be a very bright lad. He often engaged Oskar in activities that stirred his mind and kept him thinking. Their relationship was very idealistic. If everyone had a father like Thomas Schell, the world would be a better place.Unfortunately, the world isn't a better place. We learn that Tom Schell was one of the over 3,000 victims who perished at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Since his body was never recovered, an empty coffin was buried at his funeral which troubled his young son.Oskar has great difficulty coping with his father's death. His mother Linda (Sandra Bullock, ""The Blind Side"") is beyond grief over losing her husband and worries over the self-imposed social isolation of Oskar. He engages in self injury, pinching himself all over his body, while dealing with his calamity.One year later Oskar finally visits his father's bedroom again. While seeking a connection to his father, he discovers a mysterious key in an envelope labeled ""Black."" What is this key? Why was it in his father's possession? Convinced the key must have a significant meaning, and a possible message from his late father, Oskar is on a quest to discover what the key opens. He meets the film's most interesting character who is simply known as ""The Renter"" (Max von Sydow, ""Shutter Island""). He's an elderly gentleman who secretly lives with Oskar's grandmother (Zoe Caldwell). He hasn't spoken a word since experiencing the Holocaust firsthand. Here is a man who hasn't been able to cope much with the world around him, similar to Oskar. He's seen his fair share of unhappiness, though he does find compassion for Oskar and aids him to find out what the key is for.It's nice to see a unique friendship develop between the two. ""The Renter"" helps bring the fearful Oskar out of his ""shell."" As they bond, we discover the secret Oskar has kept since the final moments of his father's life and who ""The Renter"" really is.""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is a rather strange film. The subject matter is the most serious of its kind: dealing with the emotional toll on those who are the survivors of the victims of Sept. 11. At the same time, the film gets a little whimsical in its quest to make sense of loss. The key, the elderly mute fellow and a tambourine are bizarre elements in a story of a young boy coming to terms with the events in life beyond our control. I normally would not mind whimsy in movies about youth and discovery, but this is a story that uses Sept. 11 as a major plot device. Is it too soon for a breezy film with Sept. 11 as a backdrop? Can that fateful day be used as a springboard for this kind of film?This feature is based on the book of the same name by Jonathan Safran Foer. The critics of that book echoed many of the same concerns I had with the film version. Harry Siegel of the New York Press titled his review ""Extremely Cloying & Incredibly False: Why the author of 'Everything Is Illuminated' is a fraud and a hack,"" believing Foer was exploiting Sept. 11 for his personal financial gain. Anis Shivani with The Huffington Post went as so far to add Foer to ""The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers."" In contrast, The Spectator felt ""the book is a heartbreaker: tragic, funny and intensely moving.""The book was adapted into the screenplay by Eric Roth, who also scripted ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Like ""Extremely Loud,"" those are films about unique characters in unique circumstances. One can assume this kind of movie might be Roth's screen writing ""calling."" Behind the camera directing is Stephen Daldry, who brought us the acclaimed post-Holocaust drama ""The Reader."" Daldry has a penchant for real life events being the catalysts for the characters in his films to grow and develop over time. You would think with these two talents as the driving forces behind ""Extremely Loud"" you would have a thoughtful and intriguing picture.What do you get from ""Extremely Loud"" when it's over? There's no denying the first rate acting. Max von Sydow even received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role. That's saying something about a character who says nothing. The pacing is reasonable and the conclusion is what it is. You have a decent picture, but not much else. Perhaps the whimsy doesn't mix well with the most horrible national tragedy from the last decade.""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is a likable and watchable film with some great moments. It just doesn't resonate with you afterwards. You are left asking yourself, what was this about and why? I suspect it's about coping with dramatic change and growing beyond comfort zones. But shouldn't a film framed within the aftermath of Sept. 11 be something more? One would think.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
141,mollidew,Outstanding and heartfelt for a child with Aspergers,10,17 September 2012,"I gave this movie a 10 realizing most who watched the movie would not get it. This movie should have won an academy award and so should have the star, Tom Horn. Considering this was his first acting job he was amazing. The movie was so intense I cried. I worked with children with various forms of Autism Spectrum Disorder for ten years (a label that is not in the old DSM IV but will be in the DSM V eliminating some like Asperger's) Asperger's is what this kid had and the behaviors this actor showed was right on. If you haven't been around children with this disorder you wouldn't have a clue. They don't know how to express their feelings like everyone else and they fixate on things. One never knows what that might be.I am shocked so few people got it and found the kid annoying. This is how they act many of them. They are blunt generally and say what they think and go on and on to the point you might not want to hear what they are saying because the world to them is black and white and they don't see the nuances of life. This movie was priceless in the way they showed a kid with this disorder react and try to understand the reason for his father's death in the Twin Towers. I would say to those who didn't like it do some research on the characterization and why a child would act this way. I absolutely loved this movie and I cried and cried because I perfectly understood why something like they showed could happen. His father told him he was special. I can't believe this kid could learn so much dialog. He literally carried the movie. The critics were wrong about this movie from the get go but then they aren't always correct because you can bet they probably haven't experienced a child like this and there are a lot out there and adults who are the ones inventing the gadgets you use everyday. I will read the book this is adapted from now because this is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. Too bad others couldn't appreciate it for what it was. Open up your world and get to know about such things because autism is an epidemic in the US and many kids behave this way. They don't all set up the system as in this movie but they do things similarly as if driven to the point where no one else can understand why they are doing what they are doing or even perceive how they think.

However, once his father is lost during the 9/11 attacks, Oskar finds a mysterious key inside an envelope with the name Black on it, Oskar sets out on a quest to find the lock it fits. One would think that from here the rest of the film would be all about Oskar's journey and the people he meets along the way but unfortunately it's not. Instead, what the story delivers a poor portrayal of autism and coping through tragedy. Both of these plot devices could have been great if Horn could have delivered on it. The fact that no one in the supporting cast is given anything to do is truly a pity because Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and Max Von Sydow were probably the best thing going for this movie.

I was a little disappointed by the ending, but that is just my personal opinion.The acting is what really sets thing movie apart. Thomas Horn does a great job. Although I sometimes found his character a bit rude and annoying, I think he was supposed to be that was because of his Autism Spectrum disorder. (No, I'm not saying people with autism spectrum disorders are annoying! I'm just saying that is how he portrayed the character in the film.) Max Von Sydow absolutely had one of the best performances in this movie, and, in my opinion, of the year. He was able to show so much emotion without saying a single word, it was really astounding to watch such incredible talent. Sandra Bullock does a great job, too, although she's not in the movie that much.Anyways, I don't regret watching this movie like so many others were saying. It definitely takes you on a journey, and Alexandre Despalt's wonderful score really does the film justice.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I kept asking myself as to why the mother wasn't getting him professional help because his character certainly needed it. The premise of the movie in finding what the key went to and how he eventually tracks down the owner was really far fetched.

151,deemo31,Sweet story.,9,1 December 2012,"I have to start my review by telling you all that I absolutely hate Tom Hanks. Why you might ask? Because it seems that everything he does takes a piece out of my life and he tells the story better than I could. ""That Thing You Do"" was about me. I was the drummer. My father had a TV store. We were one hit wonders. The list of stuff goes on. I don't really hate him by the way. He's amazing.I don't know if Tom had anything to do with production of this movie, but it definitely has his fingerprints on it. The story of the young boy who lost his father has some twists and turns, but in essence, it's just a story about the loss of that day told by the most innocent of victims. I wrote a series of stories very much like this. (Hence the ""I Hate Tom Hanks"" line. This story though is much more intriguing. This little kid is an amazing actor. I think at times the dialogue is a bit too ""grown up"" for him though. Sometimes he gets caught in conversations that just don't seem to work for someone his age. A minor problem.This is a tender treatment of what is undoubtedly a difficult story to tell. It always will be a very difficult story to tell. There are some points in this movie that will bring out some hate, some fear, some compassion, and some joy. After all, isn't that the kind of thing that makes you feel most alive?",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
152,CaptMTS,Touching and deeply emotional film about loss and life,9,12 February 2012,"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close was an outstanding film that highlighted the pain, suffering, and anxiety of a young boy who lost his father and struggles to keep his memory alive. The film does a great job drawing viewers into the mind and heart of the young boy.While the film covers many difficult aspects of the young boy's struggle, including social anxiety, depression, anger, and self abuse, these scenes are covered in a touching and respectful manner. Viewers can easily relate to the wide range of emotions felt by the character.Thomas Horn is outstanding as the young boy, who feels alone in the world after the loss of his father on 9/11. He pursues a secret quest that he believes was set up by his father. The quest dominates his life, as he struggles how to adapt to the loss of his father. His acting deserves much recognition in an amazing performance.The other actors are excellent as well. Tom Hanks is very good as his beloved father, Sandra Bullock does great as a mother who struggles to relate to her unique son, and Max von Snydow is wonderful as ""The Renter"" who doesn't speak but befriends the young boy on his quest.The director does an outstanding job of moving through a dual story of the young boy's current quest and the unveiling of the events of 9/11, which haunt the young boy as the ""Worst Day"". Director effectively captures that raw emotions of the characters in a difficult and touching story. Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close was an outstanding film that should win many awards for the director, actor, and movie. The film is a touching drama that, despite covering painful emotions and events, provides inspiration as it highlights the strength of relationships and the human spirit.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
153,ryansassy1,"Soulful, sad, and incredibly sweet.",7,11 September 2012,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a film that haunts you all day after the closing credits. I just watched it this morning, Sept. 11th, 2012--weeping continually, which is not a typical reaction from me. Powerful stuff.The story is about a child who lost his father in the World Trade Center attacks on that fateful day in our country's history. It is his journey to reconnect with his father's memory by going on a quest to find the lock that fits the key left mysteriously in a vase in his father's closet. Along the way, this shy and sensitive boy Oskar is forced to meet and interact with a range of citizens, and to hear their stories too.More importantly, it is about connectedness. It is about realizing that you aren't alone in your pain, and learning how to reach out to others for help and comfort. It is about realizing that your alone-ness is an illusion.I loved, loved, loved the chemistry of the father and son in the flashback scenes, loved the delightful and unconventional expeditions they embarked upon, and enjoyed coming along with Oskar and The Renter to solve the final mystery of the key. I thought that the child actor playing Oskar was wonderful in this breakout role; he carried the movie quite well, almost singlehandedly-- except for those scenes with Max Von Sydow's silent character, The Renter. Of course Von Sydow stole the show, and totally deserved his Academy nomination. In all, the actors were brilliant and compelling to match the heartfelt script.Yes, there was a certain amount of emotional manipulation involved in this tearjerker (what else could you expect from a Sandra Bullock production nowadays?). I can overlook that and wholeheartedly recommend EL&IC to anybody as possibly the best ""9/11"" film to date.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
154,ckolet37,Oscar bait and an awful kid,3,2 August 2013,"I hated the kid. I know hate is a strong word, but I just despise his character. Thomas Horn actually tries with this performance, but it is a combination of bad writing and misguided directing that drags this movie down, fast. The book was highly controversial because some believed that it was banking off of such a tragedy as 9/11. I dislike the film because it is Oscar bait. I hate it more because the Oscars went hook, line and sinker for this film and I don't know why. No I do know why, because this is Oscar bait. Tom Hanks gives a performance that cannot redeem this film, he tries as well as a remarkably talented cast including Sandra Bullock, Max Von Snydow and Viola Davis, but these performances cannot redeem this film. The third act tries to turn the film around with an unpredictable conclusion, however it cannot save it because of the sugary final ten minutes, the writing just crashes and burns at such a pivotal time, I almost gave it a five, almost but it was too late. The damage is done, I will never see this movie again.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
155,aj-to,Worst film I've seen since long,4,8 April 2012,"How they got the nerves to connect the real and profound drama of 9/11 to this dragon, is a total guess. Maybe because today people don't have that much reservations anymore. Anyhow, it's tasteless. And do Americans so much like annoying kids, that would be better off with their asses kicked? I absolutely loath that conniving, politically correct attitude of parents towards their children in American movies. They're spoiling them into arrogant wiseacres this way, like with this kid. Or with the one in Spielberg's Empire of the son, or that kid in About a boy (with Hugh Grant), and so on. Those children are terribly irritating, having been set way beyond their age. Children should be children, not little adults; the whole rest of their life they can be like that, not that it's so much a desirable status. But the whole picture of a kid reprimanding and raging against grown-ups, even towards an 80-upper, is utterly detestable. Furthermore, this film was artificial, with poor suggestions of some mystery, and boringly slow, without any gripping story to hold on. I cannot understand why Hanks and Bullock chose to play a part in this one. As able actors, they should have known better; such movies cling to your reputation. I can only hope they won't have to pay the piper too much for it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
156,thegreatshonen,Incredibly Close to being good,6,8 April 2013,"This is not a bad movie. Worthy of best picture? Perhaps not but that's all opinion. Extremely Loud & Increibly Close is emotionally pulling (sometimes strangling) movie that follows Oskar Schell's quest to find out what his father left for him in the form of a key. His father was a Jeweler who perished in 9/11 during a business meeting that day in the World Trade Center. Oskar ,a year later, finds a key in the vase to a lock that is tied in to someone with the last name of Black.Ill start by what I liked by it. What works is the Male figures of Oskar's family. Tom Hanks is good in a minor role. Thomas Horn is commendable in his role too slough he does have his annoying moments. But the real star of this Max Von Sydow. I feel like I'll take a moment and recognize this superb actor. He plays the role of ""The Renter"" a silent Holocaust victim who helps Oskar in his quest. He gives the film heart and the middle section of its life. He deserved the Oscar Nomination and my opinion the Oscar for best supporting actor. I've always loved silent performance because they require the actor to become more involved in their part. Sandra Bullock was also OK in her role, nothing special though. I also loved the soaring score of it, fit the mood nicely to most of the movie. There's a lot I didn't like. I found Oskar annoying even if he possibly has a mental illness. He was pretty selfish and rude throughout the movie but then again this is an 11 year old kid. The Film was also too emotionally draining in e wrong ways at points and the camer work was spotty too. Overall OK movie but lacks something to make it particularly good, instead of above- average.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
157,lamiaaos,Inevitable Frustration,6,6 February 2012,"Just because you're making a movie about a tragedy does not mean that the audience will instantaneously commiserate with the characters involved. As I sit and watch this movie I feel that my emotions are somehow manipulated so as to force me to feel something I did not want to feel. Throughout the course of this film I sensed that perhaps the lead character, Oskar, was supposed to connect with us and even though he was granted pretty much the whole two hours of the movie's screen time to do so, failed miserably. His acting was too exaggerated that it was almost unreal. The performance he gave was almost cartoonish, and the feelings he spoke of were not reciprocated in his actions. I am sure I am not alone when I say that I felt absolutely nothing for his character. Yes one or two scenes succeeded at unleashing a few bursts of grief within me, but they sunk back into my untouched heart just as quickly as they had appeared.There was one scene in particular that started to grab my attention, where Oskar managed to blurt out his quite disturbing desire for his mother's death, in a rather malicious manner. So, instead of relating to the lead character, our hands are forced into resenting him during his entire performance. So, the only thing Oskar succeeded at was that he somehow managed to engrave an unforgettable impression in our mindsand not a good one at that. The word ""obnoxious"" popped up in my head over and over again every time Oskar popped on the screen, which was pretty much all the time, unfortunately. And dare I say that he was indeed incredibly loudloud and unbearable. Von Sydow was nice to watch and he gave us a tad bit of hope that the film might take a turn for the better, but not even his authentic performance could save this awkward flop of a movie. However, I have to admit that the last half hour of the movie eased my pain, and that each time Sandra Bullock came on screen I felt somehow safe. She managed to hold the movie together with her genuine portrayal of how far a mother's affection can go. But, that sense of security soon vanished when Sandra was no longer on the screen. So, all in all, kudos Sandra, but this movie's demise was just inevitable.I am deeply saddened by the fact that I had eagerly waited for the release of this motion picture, but what a waste that proved to be. Extremely loud & incredibly close takes you on a journey you are ever so reluctant to take, and gives you reasons supporting that reluctance that only grows stronger as the movie progresses. The movie was nothing more than a kid trying to find a lock that fits a key entrusted to him by his father, and never did it feel like anything other than just that. Although, I feel I should mention that it did succeed at leaving us feeling pity for the mother and contentment that we weren't the ones having to deal with Oskar!Oh, I forgot to mention that Tom Hanks was featured in this film, and for those brief moments we watched him on the big screen, we waited for a breakthrough performance that never came through. We waited for so much throughout the course of the movie, but it turned out to be a sham, and we left the theater more annoyed and agitated than content and moved. 2012 has yet to prove that it's a good year for movie buffs everywhere, as all the evidence so far is pretty much against it. And so we'll wait for that flick that will turn the tables for this year6/10",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I don't remember crying as hard at any other movie like I did with this one. Some of the scenes will stay with me for the rest of my life.This is a powerful movie, to say the least! Nearly 12 years after 9/11, I discovered that the tragedy -- for me -- is still a deep, unhealed wound. I thought it had healed over, and formed scars that weren't painful any more. How wrong I was. One of the scenes was so powerful, I let loose a noise that came from my core, and was crying so hard I couldn't even speak. I had to pause it, because I couldn't see through the tears, or hear through the sobbing.The child actor who plays the main character was not an actor, but recruited for the movie because they saw him on Jeopardy (he won!) and liked what they saw.

162,DearIMDB,A little boy lost...,8,18 March 2012,"From the moment I saw the opening credits I got a deep uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, the same feeling I got the first time I saw images of ""The Falling Man"" after 9/11. I'm not good with height and I'm not good watching someone go through the last few moments of their life which in this case was abstract. It brought back those terrible brutal images. My imagination goes into overdrive trying to put myself into ""their"" shoes. What goes through their minds in the final moments; how crazed with fear must you be to jump from a skyscraper or was it a rational decision about the inevitability of their situation; how long does it take to fall; what are they thinking during those last moments. The boy - Oskar - played by Thomas Horn seems to feel all of that and more in the grief of losing his beloved father as he pieces together the last minutes of his father's life and his own involvement on the periphery. His character verges on the autistic, his passion and intensity incredibly moving as he strives to discover the secret of a key he believes his father left him - an element to a game they played constantly with each other which relied on clues and solutions. The key leads him on a journey of both discovery and the labyrinth of his own mind and emotions. For a first performance - or even as a seasoned performer - it is remarkable. His apparent comprehension of the nuances of mood and emotion was breathtaking. I got the same tingle from his performance as I did watching Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense perhaps even more so. Ironically this movie has the same ""Watch Again"" appeal. Max Von Sydow gives a wonderfully moving performance as a mysterious and slightly creepy mute lodger who lives at Oskar's grand mother's apartment across the street and who communicates through note pad and felt tip pen. He speaks not one word throughout but he tells us so much through a moving understated performance. I can watch just about anything with Tom Hanks. But this movie isn't really about his character as much as the boy's. The role didn't seem to warrant his stellar presence as much as it did Von Sydow's. Casting Sydow was a brilliant move. I imagine Tom Hanks was needed to get the movie some attention but for what it's worth, he slides seamlessly into the role of adoring parent. Sandra Bullock as the painfully dignified grieving wife and mother rounds out a great cast which featured some touching vignettes including the always great value John Goodman as a doorman with whom Oskar exchanges insults, touching performances too by Viola Davis and Jeffery Wright and Zoe Caldwell as the grandmother - best known for her appearances on Broadway. From the moment the movie starts you are absorbed by the painful frustrations of Oskar's obsessive determination to find answers, and his coming to terms with the loss of his father. You may be emotionally drained at the end but believe me, it will worth it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
163,fellow456,Blatant Emotion-Grab,6,10 March 2013,"Pros: I don't know if I've mentioned this to you, but I'm kind of a big Tom Hanks fan. In the world of cinema, I'm pretty confident that a better actor cannot be found currently or in the past. And for another one of his caliber to come along in the future would simply be super awesome. Almost like the Second Coming of Christ, but without any of the sacrilege a comparison like that might normally imply. Accordingly, I spent much of the movie hoping for Mr. Hanks to pop back up on the screen, so that I could cry some more about the fact that he was dead (that's a spoiler only if you know absolutely nothing about the movie, by the way). This wasn't necessarily Hanks' best work, but I'm not going to complain about any opportunity to see him strut his stuff on the silver screen. Especially when he's providing me with an excellent parental role model, whereby his primary function in life appeared to be blatantly lying to his son in a playful sort of ""I'm going to fill my kid's head with so many stupid little factual inaccuracies that he's going to have a complex when he's older"" way.Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. It's really important to me to be able to watch a movie and understand what it is that the characters are saying to me. That is, if there's talking at all. Some movies this year just sidestepped that problem completely. So anyway, it was nice that, quite unbelievably, a small child was able to deliver each of his lines in a manner that I could both hear and understand. In the emotionally raw reality of this movie, you have a little boy able to deliver lines in a very straight laced, non-speech-impeded, discernible manner. Wait a second...Cons: Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. Why in the world does he speak so clearly? It's actually kinda creepy. And eventually very much wore on my nerves. I suppose it fit his character as some sort of improperly undiagnosed Asperger's-affected boy, but that's honestly not really the kind of character with whom I'm prone to identify.I also couldn't identify with his motivation through the course of the movie. I've never particularly struggled with death, but that's most likely some sort of character flaw of my own, and I've also never had to go through the loss of, say, the only person in the world with whom I share some sort of bond. Or even the loss of a parent, for that matter. I'll count myself lucky on that front, obviously, and I will momentarily admit that I actually do remember ""The Worst Day"" and didn't find myself immune to the emotional effects of the movie.Overall: Anyway, when I was able to take myself out of the fairly brow-beating sentiment of the movie and think about it objectively, it didn't necessarily strike me as well done or as eloquent as the boy himself. I think most of the effect of the movie just comes from the ability of nearly every audience member being able to identify with either losing a parent or with the horrific events of 9/11 itself. Or both. And it seemed to cash in fairly ruthlessly on those two things, almost using the crying version of a laugh track, indicating to the audience when they ought to choke up. *Cue double-emotion-whammy Tom-Hanks-as-Falling-Man flashback as I, with teary eyes, give the movie a 6 out of 10.*",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

At the time of my watching this film, it had already been nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor though it was only deserving of the latter. What upsets me more than anything is pairing two of Hollywood's highest paid and most talented celebrities (Hanks and Bullock) and giving them parent acting roles that any average person could play off the street. Thomas Horn plays the main character Oskar Schell. Had it otherwise not been assumed has severe autism in the film, he would of been in my perspective one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen on the ""silver screen"". Had it not been for ""The Renter"" making an appearance on screen, I was literally seconds away from walking out of the theater for an equal amount of boredom and annoyance. All the 9/11 premised films thus far have frustrated me. United 93 and World Trade Center, both released in 2006, I had about the same reaction to.

It will take you to the highest high of bliss and the gallows of sorrows. A kid who has the most amazing father (Tom Hanks) who challenges and encourages him in the most positive way loses him to 9/11. There's a theory if the sun exploded we would still have 8... minutes before we realize the impact because it takes that much time for sunlight to reach earth. The kid wants these 8 minutes with his dad to stretch forever.To do this he starts looking through his dad's things and finds a key in a blue vase. He then starts a quest to look for the lock that this key would fit and goes on to meet numerous people of all cast and creed who have gone through or are going through sadness just like him establishing the fact that he is not alone in his suffering and gives him strength to go on with life.The movie is so well written and enacted by the kid and its cast that you can't find a fault with it. You will be chuckling one moment and the next crying buckets/drums/tanks of tears. My all time favorite movie is ""Pay it Forward"" because of its concept. The 2nd in line would be EL&IC.

I was totally absorbed in it. I did not care if it was realistic or not. This is not a documentary, and least of all on 9/11. It is just a story told on the silver screen.'Extremely loud and incredibly close' is a story of a boy who suddenly lost his father and is grieving, without realizing that others are grieving too, because he is too young to understand. He finds his own way of working through the grief. Thomas Horn as the 9 year old totally carries the movie- great talent. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock attracted me to this movie, and they did well in their roles, as did Max Von Sydow, as the surprising and at times a bit scary renter, but the movie belonged to young Thomas Horn. He kept me glued to the chair. Viola Davis was a nice surprise; I did not know she had a small role in this movie. Alexander Desplat continues to amaze me with his scores; it is excellent,like his work in other movies.The 9/11 connection is not necessary for the story, but it does give it more intensity, born out of familiarity, because we know about the national shock and grief. I did not feel that 9/11 was exploited in any way. This is certainly an emotional movie, and those who dislike emotions may find it melodramatic, but there are some that don't mind shedding some tears in a movie because it touched their hearts. I prefer drama/family to sci-fi effects, stunts, fights and non-stop action, so I enjoyed the movie, once it got on track. I felt deeply touched toward the end when there was some kind of resolution about the key- the one thing the story revolves around. The rest of the audience in the theater seemed to be totally in it, with occasional laughter, and some tears.ELAIC has its flaws. It needed to be shorter by about 10 minutes. It seemed to drag in parts. The first part definitely needed to get on track faster, and it may have lost some audience because it did not. Usually I don't care for the back and forth flashback format, but it works in some movies and I thought it worked well in this one. I have not read the novel, but I would have preferred a shorter title for the movie. The very long title did not make a whole lot of sense to me. That is a minor point however.Overall, I came out feeling that it was a very touching movie, but it is not for everyone, as the mixed reviews indicate.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
171,msmith5484,What does this key open.... who cares?,5,18 January 2012,"This is a story of an odd boy (who may have asberger syndrome (""The tests were inconclusive"")) grieving his father who dies on 9/11 when the South tower collapses. He tries to hold on to his father by tracking down the lock to a key he finds in his father's closet. The journey he takes (dragging us along) doesn't go anywhere and we learn very little about the boy, his father or why we should care. Along the way we have a reconciliation with the boy's grandfather who abandoned his son (Tom Hanks) years earlier, but, big deal, they don't seem to have any real emotional connection so neither do we. This pairing of odd boy and mute grandfather might have been very interesting, but we don't feel much of a bond between them. When we finally reach the end of our journey and discover where the key belongs, it is unsatisfying. Maybe because the father didn't even know about the key so it really had nothing to do with him, so the entire journey was ultimately fruitless, except to add another layer of 'father/son' disconnection, which is odd because we're shown that this boy and his father had a great relationship. I'm not sure why this had to take place on 9/11. Almost nothing is made of it and we're not shown the attack having any effect on the city or these people except that this mother and son lost someone. He could have gotten killed by a drunk driver and it would have mattered the same to the audience. The best and most effective scene is between mother and son (Sandra Bullock and Thomas Schell) as they fight and cry about missing their husband and father. I'm certain the film makers wanted to make a thoughtful, emotional 'father/son' movie, but the true bonds between a father and son are not expressed very well and that's too bad.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

They aren't in it, that's how.Instead the entire movie is focused on a self-centered, know-it-all brat who thinks 9/11 was all about him and only him. This boy is not only annoying, he speaks so precisely and enunciates so well, his voice screams ACTING COACH, which completely removed me from anything he was saying. It was an affect I could not get used to, even though he talks through (and narrates) the entire film.The script itself was so far-fetched and ridiculous it was impossible to suspend disbelief. No kid would do what this kid did, and no mother would allow it for a billion and one reasons, much less do what this mother did.This movie tried so hard to tug at your emotions but the only parts that did were the few bits the writer didn't have to make up because they actually happened that day.Audience members are supposed to watch a drama and say to themselves, ""Yeah, life's like that,"" on some level.

The main character (the boy) is just horrible and should be put in a mental institution. He's a terrible actor and ruined the movie. It is beyond me how this movie received a best picture nomination. It should have been nominated for a Razzie. This movie generally received negative reviews and I completely agree. What a waste of a movie and waste of Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock talents. The whole 9/11 plot is just over played and directors need to come up with more interesting ideas. This movie is a borefest and pointless. Stay away from this turd.

178,lauralmhs,High expectations; extreme disappointment,5,6 February 2012,"""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"" while perhaps not the worst movie I've ever seen, was certainly one of the most disappointing.I went to see this movie with great expectations, together with a friend who was ""brave"" enough to want to see it with me, another friend refusing to attend, fearing that it would be too emotionally wrenching. As it turns out, this movie was anything BUT emotionally wrenching. While aiming to be emotionally affecting, it was in fact just plain FLAT. I saw the film in New Jersey, an audience with close connections to the 9/11 tragedy, and while I could hear some viewers crying softly afterwards, I couldn't help but think that an audience that lacked the same nexus to the actual event could never have had such a visceral reaction to such a manipulative story. The movie revolves around Oscar, son of the Tom Hanks character who dies in the World Trade Center. (Hanks plays a lowly jeweler in a run down neighborhood who owns a shop with pull-down metal security gates; it's a stretch to think that he would be having a ""business meeting"" at Windows on the World, but that's just one small implausibility in a movie chockful of them.) A year after ""the worst day,"" as he refers to 9/11 throughout the film, Oscar cannot come to terms with his father's death and tries to maintain his link to him by obsessing over his personal possessions. One day while rummaging through his father's closet, he comes across a mysterious key in an envelope labeled ""Black."" Without going into too much detail, this discovery sends him on an odyssey through New York City to solve the mystery that this key will unlock, some clue that will hopefully bring him closer to his father. I am all for suspending belief in the context of a motion picture (after all, what's wrong with pure entertainment?), but what follows is the most implausible, unbelievable, ridiculous storyline you can possibly imagine. For one thing, that Oscar's mother (played by the always sympathetic Sandra Bullock) would allow a mentally challenged young boy to traipse around NYC on his own is simply inconceivable. When we learn later on that she had figured out his bizarre, off-the-wall strategy and was actually shadowing him all along on his wild pursuits, it becomes even more absurd. This movie had no climax and positively no resolution. My companion said she spent the entire movie ""waiting for something to happen."" Alas, nothing ever does. At the point in the film where the audience discovers what the key unlocks (which should have been some grand revelation), we hit a brick wall as the plot does not even disclose what is contained within the mysterious box! There is a tender scene where the owner of the box covers Oscar's hand with his own in an attempt to calm the distraught boy, which leads you to expect that perhaps the man will become an important part of the fatherless boy's life (a mentor, if you will) - which I think would have added nicely to the storyline - but nothing of the sort happens. Similarly, you might expect that among the literally hundreds of people the boy meets in his quest, he might forge a few meaningful friendships that would bring him out of his neurotic shell, but that doesn't happen either.Likewise, the concluding scene of Oscar swinging on a playground swing leaves potential untapped. In the wake of an earlier scene with his father, you would have expected something significant to happen at this point. Nothing does. There is also a subplot about a mysterious, mute ""renter,"" who turns out to be the boy's biological grandfather. But what was the intent or purpose of this character to the plot?? And all those references to a ""sixth borough""?? What was THAT all about?? This movie went absolutely nowhere and had absolutely no resolution, or at best an unsatisfying one. I can only hope that the book on which this film was based fleshes out some of these themes and fills in some of these gaps. The only redeeming features to this movie (and the reasons why I didn't give it fewer stars) were the excellent acting by the young actor in the role of Oscar and the cinematography. One of the reviewers on this site dubbed this movie ""Extremely Dull and Incredibly Pointless"" and I would have to heartily agree with this assessment. I keep hearing that this is ""the best movie of 2011."" If this is the case, I think I'll skip the next Oscars presentation.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Tom Hanks, however short his part, is lovely in his role and Sandra Bullock (who plays Oskar's mother) is so convincing, I cried.

It is the most sickening concoction I have ever subjected myself to. I would even think this work is wholly insulting to families of 911 victims because it is so pathetically designed to please and so ill equipped to provide any meaningful insight beyond vacuous and overly didactic commentary, running on and on; it drowns its desire to cater to an America still in need of a catharsis inside a tub of flatulent and opportunistic overreach. If we, as a culture, are still forbidden to talk about 911 in any sort of a meaningful way, then this picture is the gag order - and gag we do. It is our creative Patriot Act. Where are the film makers with guts, and anger? Where are the writers who bleed from the groin, and are willing to die writing? They have been bought up by comfort and self-congratulatory lifestyles - they are poised to win Oscars for pandering instead of screaming with all their might.

A boy who lost his father by 9.11 look for a keyhole with some clue that his father left. From this title and jacket of this film's DVD, we maybe can't expect story of this film. However I started watching this film, I'm surprised Thomas Horn's acting. His eyes, his speech, his motion and his expression, all of these attract me. I have a impression of this film that there is quiet and pale color, so Thomas Horn's acting is distinguish. I think it is no wonder that this film is sad story because it is nonfiction and there are many people who experienced like this story. However it is not all. We feel warm and love.

182,Krys78,Thomas Horn was incredible in this film!,9,12 June 2012,"I have to say I've read quite a few bad reviews on here and I cant figure out why? Do you think Oskar's search was for nothing? Far from it! He helped another individual that was connected to his father in even a small way! That's a sort of Paying It Forward. But its not the story I want to review its the actor Thomas Horn who played Oskar Schell. Having experience in the industry myself and someone who studies actors for a living, I have to say Thomas has talent beyond his years. How he was able to sell to us on not only his character but everything he did, from his walk, from his physical acting with props and how he was able achieve all this as a 'rookie' is incredible! How he was able to keep it together through that extremely long monologue is beyond me. The movie was pretty much his playground and he just shined all the way through! If this was his first major role, I wonder how he auditioned in the first place? Most advanced or veteran actors couldn't pull it off let alone sell it and he SOLD IT! I hope this kid continues to share his talent and gets a lot of work in the near future. It wouldn't shock me if his mailbox is FULL of scripts, daily! Amazing! If I can be even 25% as good as that kid I will consider myself VERY lucky and talented. :)",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
183,staff-577-378882,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Movie Review,3,20 January 2012,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Movie ReviewDirected by Steven Daldry Written by Eric Roth (screenplay), Jonathan Safran Foer (novel)Haley Joel Osment. Dakota Fanning. Macaulay Culkin. I'm not a big fan of child actors. They tend to overact. Their big doting eyes emoting what the directors have told them to do. It's hard to relate with them, or empathize with their conflict. I wish I could tell you Thomas Horn in ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" was any different. The kid has talent, that's for sure. But for a movie that means to milk emotional responses from the audience, it is hard to find any connection from an eleven year old in pjs. Horn plays Oskar Schell, a snappy, quirky, and inquisitive pre-puberty preteen who's oddities verges on elements of Aspergers. Oskar's father Thomas is a fun loving, inquisitive, jewelry maker, played deftly by Tom Hanks, who dies in the World Trade Center attacks. About one year after 9/11, Oskar accidentally finds a key in his father's closet that he becomes convinced will unlock answers that only he was intended to find. Oskar's life becomes a race against time to try and hold on to the good memories of his father, and the reality of life moving on with his humdrum mother (Sandra Bullock). Through a detective process that's part Sherlock Holmes, part Pippi Longstocking, Oskar goes on an adventure around the five boroughs questioning New York's inhabitants for clues. Despite his choir boy voice, and over-enunciating voice overs, Oskar becomes the annoying character in the piece. Instead of feeling sorry for the kid, we end up empathizing with his mom, who has to try to find a way to connect to her estranged child. The best character comes from Max von Sydow's tenant, who plays a mute renter of his grandmother's apartment. The renter's silent frustration of Oskar's mission, and agreeing to accompany him on his quest, mimics the viewer's own plight as we are forced to chaperone this kid on what we already know is a false errand. The movie is not about what the key unlocks, nor about September 11th. Rather, its about how we grieve with a loss, and despite failures and flaws, ultimately learn how we learn to forgive and keep going. At least, that's what it intends to be. What ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" becomes is a tightly crafted, beautifully filmed, but searingly hollow tearjerker. It makes you feel sorry for the people that are around the kid that we're supposed to feel sorry for, which is the saddest thing about the film.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

If it had been about a child whose father died on the Lusitania, no one would have cared; it certainly would not have received nominations. That should tell you all you need to know.However, all the folks here yelling about the main character are ridiculous. Of course the kid is annoying. He is autistic, geniuses.

The director slaps in a couple of well liked stars ala Hanks and Bullock and thinks it's great. Well it's not. Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close has a story worth telling, but it deserves better than the treacly and pretentious treatment director Stephen Daldry gives it. His adaptation is like trying to play football with a square of concrete; it's hard and boring. It feels like a Very Special Episode of a hopelessly lightweight kids TV show, misguidedly attempting to have its say on an issue it can barely comprehend, let alone interpret. When it was finally over, I found myself not just disappointed, but a little annoyed. Frankly, it seems more than a little like a cheat.

This sets Oscar off to search for what the key belongs to. While also meeting new people. One of these new people include a mute man whom is referred to as ""The renter."" This film has some potential to it, it's based on a book by aclamined author Jonathan Safran Foer. I'm not too sure if the movie strays from the book. In some cases this works for a movie.This however, does not work for this movie.This movie is not good, for a couple of reasons. But the biggest reason why I didn't like this movie is mainly the main character Oscar. I found him to be obnoxious and rather unlikable, or at least that's my opinion on him.I'm not sure if it's the script or the actor himself but this character is just so unlikable to me. From what I've read he is different in the book, I can't verify this to be 100% sure. However In one or two scenes, that are quiet scenes this actor does a pretty decent job, but for the most part he is just unlikable.For the most part I dislike this film, but it's really it's side characters that really save this film. Actors like Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are fairly decent in their parts. But the thing that really saves this movie is the performance by legendary actor Max Von Sydow, who the plays the mute character known as ""the renter"". His performance is just so amazing and just really saves this movie from getting a much lower rating from me; his role was so good in fact that he was nominated for an Oscar in the best supporting actor category. Keep this in mind that his character does not speak and has the words 'yes' and 'no' tattooed on his hands, and writes things down in a notebook he carries. I honestly think that the best parts of this film truly involves him. All in all I really have mixed feelings with this film. It does have good directing from the director Stephen Daldry. And again, the acting from most of the supporting cast is very good. While I think that the film tries a bit too hard to irk and emotion from you, and also the child actor Thomas Horn is decent in quiet parts. He just annoys and irritates me in a lot of parts as well. So for me this does have a mixed reaction. If you see it see it for the supporting cast and make your own opinion about the Thomas horn's acting ability.

But the biggest problem this film suffers from is a lead character that is obnoxious and annoying(as was the case with the 2011 film Hannah)..and, given the important subject matter at hand, the viewer MUST have a narrator they can relate to.

He just wants to stay connected to the memory of his father. Much of the movie is focused on this little boy going on a journey and trying to heel his heart. Horn has some amazing acting chops.

There was definitely a Q & A after. Which, I believe is the writers intent. Definitely rare qualities in this one.The acting: excellent. I made the mistake of watching Larry Crowne, because I'm a Tom Hanks fan- and I have to say: he redeemed himself on this one. Thomas Horn has body language and ticks and emotional skills way beyond his age. Sandra Bullock as the haggard single mom... whoa. They roughed her up for this. Max Von Sydow delivered without saying a word. This movie is very moving & I was choked up for most of it. Better to watch with a loved one, and not worry about holding back.

Yes, I teared up at several moments, but the movie does not stoop to the over-wrought sentimentality that a movie like ""War Horse"" does. Instead, it takes you on an incredible journey and this young actor so embodies the lead, every emotion, every challenge. I think it really honors 9/11 in the same way that ""Reign on Me"" did.

193,mjcom99,"Fascinating film, until it collapses like a burning skyscraper.",5,24 December 2015,"A moving film with many amazing virtues--and a horribly flawed plot. The initial hooks are the deep trauma of the 9/11 attacks, the unusual (Aspergers-specturm, we come to realize) young protagonist, and the themes of bereavement and abandonment, with resultant anger and desperation, and courageous struggle. All this is set-up skillfully, and developed righteously.For most of it duration, the film carefully builds a symbolic world of an heroic lad who undertakes a mythic quest. Like all mythic quests, it is a search for meaning. Both the lad's engaging personal qualities, and the revealed-by-inches mysteries of his past and his quest, kept my interest level way up around fascination.Then the film, at the end, becomes in itself a horrible, meaningless disaster. The mythic quest is yanked into a totally different, antagonistic myth. It is revealed that his mother always knew what he was doing, that he never was 'really' a lonely, vulnerable searcher, pitting his wits and courage against the universe. Instead his adventures were actually choreographed and closely-supervised--his mother figured out where he was going, and set everything up ahead of time. So our lad is demoted from hero to child-on-a-ride, and the story becomes a tribute to the all-knowing, all-caring mommy-goddess.What could have been one of the great movies thus becomes one that deserves the 'worst film of the year' votes it got in the Village Voice.

After seeing some trailers, my 10 year old was keen to view it ; and it appeared a harmless enough movie based on a 10 year old boy. While my daughter was not upset by the movie, suffice to say it was on the depressing/morbid side - with not a chuckle or light word to be seen anywhere. As to the actors, particularly the young boy ; EXCELLENT - if sometime in the future a director is looking for an actor to play a suicidal and/or depressed teen then look no further - I predict a big future for him.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
196,Alik713,A most unusual telling of aftermath of 9/11,8,14 January 2012,"One boy's reaction one year after to the loss of his father in the NYC World Trade Center bombing.What could have been an utterly sappy story, is told in a calm, poignant manner, through the eyes of hypochondriac 9-year old. Little boy with barely a connection to his mother, feeling a lot closer to his paternal grandma, tries to preserve his connection with his dad, despite father's untimely departure.A year passes since ""the worst day"", and, Oskar desperately tries to keep his father memory from fading. ""If the sun were to die, we'd not know it for another 8 minutes, because that's how long it takes for sunlight to reach us."" Feeling that his 8 minutes with his father are about to expire, and, upon finding a key in his father's closet, Oskar sets off on a journey that will bring him closer to his parents, others, struggling with after-effects of 9/11, and, most importantly, himself.Apart from musical score, highly reminiscent of ""Catch me if you can"", the movie is highly original, unique look at coming-out-of-childhood, told through the eyes of a ""special"" little kid, trying so hard to make things normal.Very much a home-run effort for British director Stephen Daldry!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
197,gummo_rabbit,A moving masterpiece,10,29 July 2015,"This is easily one of the most impressive movie experiences I ever had. One that stayed with me a very long time. There is so much going on in terms of storytelling, emotion and the ground that it covers. Yes. It's about 9/11 and yes, it's about a young boy losing his father and not knowing how to deal with his grief. But it's also a film about overcoming your fears, about parenthood (and childhood), about metaphors and secrets, about truth and the world not making sense. It's a modern quest about love and death and the everlasting questions of life.Of course the protagonist Oskar is the main character, he really is the key (!) figure and the whole movie is built around him. And boy does Thomas Horn deliver. He succeeds in portraying Oskar as a real life figure, going through all the hardship, drama, joy and laughter, anger, grief, fear, redemption and simply finding his way through life. He is utterly believable and pulls at your guts in all the traumatic experiences he goes through.The most amazing thing he pulls off is making Oskar lovable even though Oskar is almost impossible to love. Oskar is bossy, rude, terrible to get along with. Seeing what he goes through, all on his own, you just want to comfort him and yet you know he would not be able to receive such comfort. And that makes him so intensely lovable.There are moments of pure joy in this movie too, even though there is such a sad story at the heart of it. The joy feels just as real as the tears. Absolutely delightful are the scenes between Oskar and the Renter. Here you have the amazing Max von Sydow, silver screen hero, and first timer Thomas Horn making an unforgettable pair. The scene on the bus where the Renter falls asleep and Oskar wakes him up by offering him juice, is just pure gold. Warm and hugely funny acting. As is the scene on the subway with the oxymoron wars. Each of the people whose name is Black bring something of their own to the whole as well.Visually the movie is often remarkable. The red wall in front of which Oskar and the Renter play out a decisive dialogue. The little wasp trapped in the classroom on the morning of 'the worst day'. The flashes of memory when Oskar tells his story to the Renter. Also the music, building up in tension at the most intense scenes, and the use of the clarinet in it, really enhances the atmosphere of the film.Every now and then something else will come to mind in praise of this film. It will linger in my head in the coming days and months. Like that image of Oskar ringing his tambourine, running across the bridge, shouting: 'Fort Greene! Fort Greene!' In short, I think it's a masterpiece.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I'm telling you, this film is propaganda and has everything to do with the times we are living in. The government is pulling out the big guns on us now, people. Be prepared.Do not hesitate for a moment to go see this movie. It is propaganda in every sense of the word, made and intended to toy with your emotions, your human emotions, to gain sympathy and support for a con job that was 9/11.And if you didn't believe it before, this is definitive proof they are still trying to brainwash the American people and the rest of the world into thinking what they said happened, really was what happened.Desperate, desperate attempt.

199,waltond2,Better than the critics would give it credit for.,8,20 February 2012,"8/10. Having read a number of review as I expected it ticked all the boxes of hate for the cynical British reviewer preaching to the converted. I know as Brits our default disposition is one of cynical realists unable to suspend disbelief in real life or even in a film. So, yes, this is a sentimental film, something which isn't the crime against humanity many seem to think. It doesn't tackle some of the deeper emotions of 9/11, like blame, revenge and forgiveness, but it covers loss and guilt pretty well. OK, there were a couple of times I was half-expecting the boy to say ""I see dead people"" so much like the Sixth Sense he played the character, and at times the voice over got on my nerves. However there were many moments of genuine sorrow and touching drama which more than made up for this. I really enjoyed the film, maybe because I'm getting older, but I've never cared much what other people think anyway, unlike it seems some reviewers. So go-ahead sneer at the conceit, roll your eyes at the 9/11 plot, its still a good film and I hope it wins an Oscar if only to upset the ""right-on"" film luvvys.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

It was his first movie and it was amazing , I am not sure if it was the way the movie was shot or the kids acting (maybe a little from both) but it was impressive. The scene where he tells his story to The Renter was amazing loved the way it was edited and the kids acting. It was not only that but the whole movie was shot very good so it justifies the Motin Picture nominee . Max von Sydow made a very good appearance I enjoyed but I didn't like Tom Hanks or Sandra Bullocks and I don't have a reason for it .Sometimes it felt corny sometimes it was original sometimes plain. Besides IMDb writing the genre I am gonna make it more evident. I think the movie was : 79% drama. 20% mystery that just helps the drama like an arm for the body it isn't that impressive ,it doesn't make you wander just helps the movie to develop. And is the reason this movie is not boring. 1% adventure.

I don't know if I'm afraid of being disappointed or if it's because I know that it's going to be a seriously good movie, and it's going to be emotionally engrossing or draining. Either way, I avoided this film for weeks, even when it was the only thing to watch in my file, I'd find something else. Finally, I read a review stating in the title something to the effect of ""I'll remember this movie for the rest of my days"", so I caved. Gotta see what's so good about this. Oskar (Thomas Horn), grapples with the tragic death of his beloved father Thomas (Tom Hanks), who was a jeweler working on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center on 9-11. Oskar finds a key in his father's closet and makes it his personal mission to find the lock that it opens. He's certain that maybe his father left him one final message there. His adventures will make you laugh out loud, tear up at times, may even make you angry. But you will be moved. I'm really glad I watched this.

202,The_Frase,"An exploration of grief, family and self.",6,21 February 2012,"Oscar (Thomas Horne) is an autistic child who, although quiet intellectually well equipped, lacks the social and inter personal skills of others. This is his story of losing his father (Tom Hanks) and his attempts to come to terms with this. He and his father first begin their search for the 6th borough of New York, the lost borough. This was an exercise to develop Oscar's social skills and to face the fears that hold him back. Upon his death the quest becomes one of inner strength and dealing with the unanswerable question of why?Although highly acclaimed within the industry, the film has been given some negative press, due to its pace, the level of acting and some of the narrative events most specifically 9/11. I was happy to realise upon watching the film that these were baseless.The screenplay (Eric Both) was well assembled and stayed true to the original plot and themes of the novel (Jonathan Safran Foer). The acting of Hanks and Bullock was emotive and understated, and Horne's interaction with each was excellently displayed.The films haunting score and conventional structure helps focus on the characters and more importantly on the mystery and intrigue of the quest and the obstacles that face Oscar, including those of his own imposition and some from his condition.The film is a bit of an emotional roller-coaster, which thankfully doesn't dwell on the political strife of 9/11. This being the case the events retain their true emotionally devastating effects without subverting from the original themes. Although the grandparents are less explored than I would have liked the focus on Oscar and his journey is the central. This is definitely one that is worth a watch, but you should be prepared for its emotional content.The_Frase",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

204,sim-pl,It is not about 9/11,7,2 June 2016,"I think the key to a proper reception of the film is noticing, that it is not only about 9/11, and maybe mostly not about it. Instead of 9/11 any disaster that took life of boy's father could be pictured here. It would be only a background. The film is about something else (hard to choose one word to describe it, but most appropriate for me would be ""the search""). Many negative reviews about the movie seem to be a result of that narrow way of seeing it. Also, boy's precise talk is not artificial - it might be a symptom of some form of Asperger syndrome, linked with his other behaviors.The film is moving and cleansing.

The brilliant acting on the the Oskar character's part as well as Max Van Sydow's miming performance stand out as does original storyline. I don't feel the movie took sentimental advantages although I was close to tears during certain scenes. For good reason, I thought. I found the puzzle the child was trying to assemble was also a puzzle for the audience to share. I couldn't tell exactly what was going to happen or why. I like that about the movie. I have a good friend who's child lost his dad at around the same age as Oskar, not to 9/11 but to cancer, and I couldn't help making associations and feeling for both of them. My heart was being yanked at for more personal reasons than other viewers, I'm sure. I'm not sure I'd recommend this story to my friend, though. It might be too difficult. The only part of the film I found implausible was the discovery made late in the movie about the mother. I don't want to reveal that here. That said, I'd highly recommend this one.

My mother and sister went to watch it as well and we compared our experiences: mine the book, theirs the movie. I was angry by the end of our talk.

I live in Norway and considering the number of films made, I don't even know whether it was shown in this country, I certainly do not remember it. I liked it even in the small format. My laptop stopped showing it in the middle, just when the Renter is leaving Oskar in the café, so I read the rest of what was happening, on the net. I found out that it was disliked by many reviewers and that it had been called "" the worst Best Picture nomination"". I surprised myself by starting to cry, as I had liked it. Some reviewers have called it ""boring and manipulative"", ""sugarcoated"" etc. Boring? Why not, we are all kinds. It was not boring to me. As to the nine-eleven connection, although the event was shocking, probably the impact on Americans was much stronger than what people in other countries feel, so some may feel the film is manipulative. But it made me happy that many here have liked the film. There are again a few that tell us that the official 9/11 story is not the truth.

212,artichoke6-762-897777,"9/11 is the sad premise, story is actually about the boy....",6,22 April 2012,"This movie can be viewed so many different ways:Acting - superb. Riveting to watch. Excellent.Setting - NYC, many iconic scenesTiming - movie released 10 years past 9/11, although the story takes place 1 year after 9/11Story/plot lines - there are several. Not just one. This is a story about a young autistic boy who loses his father on 9/11. His father owned a jewelry store in Manhattan and on any given day, would have been at work, not in the WTC. But he was on 9/11, for a meeting. On the first anniversary, the boy wanders into his father's bedroom closet, his mother had left everything where it was after 9/11. I can understand someone doing that, I would have also. His son finds a key, in a vase and this is when the story begins. The movie takes you on a journey from this point forward, you are on this trek with the son, looking for the lock this key fits.At times the movie deviates from the 9/11 memory but near the last 1/3 of the movie, you begin to see scenes from that day, his parents talking on cell phones, etc. I find it so sad that his dad was in the second tower hit and they were told to stay put but his wife told him to get out. Sadly, he didn't leave that tower. I take tiny details away from stories like this, I looked at my husband and told him, I would have left, I would have been in a stairwell already, after witnessing horrific scenes of jumpers, right next to our seemingly safe building. But as we all know now, people stayed in the second tower and were of course struck not long after the remain in place order.The other plot is the boy's paternal grandmother lives across the street, she and the boy share a set of walkie talkies. He can call the grandmother day or night and she will answer. Remember he is autistic. She has a renter in the room next to hers and there's a mystery there, but one that I solved before being told who this man was/is. The man goes on the treks with the young boy to find the lock.To sum up my thoughts, if you like sitting down to watch a movie but it turns out a completely different way than you thought it would, then watch it. But if you're expecting to see brave and heroic scenes from TWC towers and people fleeing to save their lives or others, you won't see that. You will just see people watching live TV coverage or papers flying in the air and lots of emergency vehicles streaming thru the city. And you do hear his father's last words.But this movie isn't mainly about 9/11. It's truly a story about an autistic boy who lost his father on that horrible day.One more reference to determine if this movie is for you or not - read the book's reviews on amazon's website, they are quite accurate. The book apparently greatly deviates from what many of us thought the story would be (9/11). Many reviewers there returned the book and got their money back. TBH, had I read the book reviews, I probably would have skipped this movie, even though I knew Hanks and Bullock are in it (but not that much, the young boy is in just about every scene).

It is a moving account of an autistic boy trying to deal with the loss of his father and his relationship with his grandmother. It is also about the tragedy of 9/11 and tells the story of the people who died in the buildings by telling the story of those they left behind and how 9/11 changed their lives. It is a cleverly made movie and contains many plot twists. You get sucked into the story and hope the bout finds the 6th burrough even though it doesn't exist, but that doesn't really matter.

Both movies contain moments of situational humor, but are predominantly infused with the sadness and confusion which are at the core of each young protagonist.

Thomas Horn brilliantly, brilliantly plays the role of a 9-year old boy who cannot possibly understand why his father was taken away from him on the morning of September 11th. Like any other 9-year old, Oskar Schell has tantrums, made all the more heart breaking knowing that he has lost his father for reasons that he is unable to comprehend or accept. He hurts himself, sometimes pinching so hard as to bruise his skin. This film belong to Horn. He deeply affects the audience, as well as the characters around him. We see one man who can't stop giving hugs to Horn, and in another scene, a girl who lets Horn ride her horse and pecks him lightly on the cheek after expressing her sorrow for his loss.We also see glimpses into the lives of dozens of different New Yorkers, as Horn goes on a journey from Fort Greene to Far Rockaway and up and down the island of Manhattan. If you love New York and thinking about the stories from each of the 8 million people here, this movie will be a delight.The shots of the city are wonderful. Not overly grand, but reliably familiar. We see Midtown from Sheep's Meadow, the brownstone apartments in Brooklyn and the train shuttling back and forth from the Rockaways. Overall, I strongly recommend you see the film.

Well, let me just say, its TOO much for anyone that experienced 9/11, period. Between the continued shots of the burning WTC towers to the slow motion pictures of falling bodies, to the lost posters, it was constant and extremely painful. What could have been a love story to the city of New York (similar to Midnight in Paris being a visual feast of Paris)fell short of that. Although the boy traveled all over the city, the movie did not take advantage of that in it's visuals. The 9/11 visuals, details, audio, etc. just overwhelmed anything else in the movie and I was literally sick to my stomach by the time the movie ended.

Still, my sympathies were with the child, annoying though he was, and I ended up having a good weep. So if it made me cry, it couldn't have been all bad. (Okay, so I'm blonde.)The story was a bit contrived - full of coincidences - not really acceptable in a serious movie, in my opinion. Without the backdrop of the 911 tragedy, I felt the story line wouldn't be at all satisfying.But I intend now to read the book, which promises to be more pleasing.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

HOWEVER, this was a complete waste of my time.Don't misconstrue... I get it. I get what the story was about and what the director was conveying to the viewer, but it just was utterly BORING.

223,steve-61-293483,Quit possibly the most horrible movie I've seen in a long time.,1,1 February 2012,"Where do I even begin? Here, we have a movie based around a boy who's father died on 9/11. His story seemed compelling enough when viewing the trailer for the movie - a boy on a quest to find something his dead father left for him to find in the city.However, this trailer was entirely misleading, as that is not what happens.Instead, what we (as an audience) experience is quite possibly the most revolting, hypocritical, arrogant, egotistical, insulting, annoying excuse of a child I have ever laid my eyes on. From telling his mother she should have died in the attacks, to slapping her awake at night on the face, to swearing insults at random people, to talking to himself, to badgering, to referring to 9/11 as the ""Worst Day"", we simply have an entire recipe of what we were brought up not to be like from our own parents.Quit possibly the worst arch in the dull, plot-less, and entirely expected storyline (you can tell where the storyline is going minutes ahead of time) is the boys cruel and decisive way of holding back 6 integral phone messages from his father, to his mother, and telling her no one called, and keeping them to himself. The messages, taken within the Trade Center by his father during the attacks were clearly of incredible significance both in the film, and to the emotional backdrop of the story. Instead, they're used to hurt, and to show the boys complete selfishness and arrogance, as well as ignorance, towards others. Words cannot express how much I wanted to get up and leave the theater as I watched this with my girlfriend, who somehow, got the movie, and cried her way through it.Looking at the movie through NON-mystified eyes, the movie has absolutely no closing value, and no joie de vivre. It's story arch is bland, and quite frankly, infuriating. In the end, you are disappointed yet again when the boy finds out nothing from his father was left for him in his hunt to find something.... anything. And instead of discovering what the key was for (his main clue as to his father leaving something for him) you find out it belonged to another man, and you don't even find out it's use or value. You then find out that his grandfather never talks, and never truly admits to being his grandfather. You find out that the boy needs a damn tambourine in order to go anywhere without being nervous, and that when he is nervous, he screams and belittles all around him.I could go on and on and on and on about how absolutely terrible this movie is in the eyes of someone who watches a movie for a deeper storyline, but instead, all I can tell you is that for someone without the ability to dive functionally into a backstory of a movie within their mind, this movie is great.Unfortunately, for the rest of us, it's a horrible and sickening tale of complete scuzz.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Opposite of many of the positive reviews, I can not help but wonder if I saw the same film as some of the other viewers. I thought this movie was absolutely dreadful. It was boring, had a poor (or no) plot, a waste of Tom Hanks' talent, but most importantly, this kid was quite possibly the most annoying character I have ever seen in a film. I am familiar with autistic children, and he not only did not portray accurate symptoms, he was a horrible actor. I honestly would have left after 30 minutes, but my friend was kind of into it and I kept thinking that it had to get better. I am not exaggerating when I say it was one of the worst films I have EVER seen (and I have seen a lot of films). It was painful, and I really did not think I was going to make it through all 2+ hours of this torment.

John Goodman and Tom Hanks are safe bets for any production. This is a story of emotions void of development, characters expressing frustration without solutions. Worst of all, a boy at times behaving like a half-nut, though not psychically disturbed enough to rate as a patient to deserve compassion and maybe healing; and not grown-up enough to handle his quest maturely. What is the purpose? With teen movies, you guess that another college year needs to be occupied with nonsense topics. Here, Max von Sydow's silence is obviously saner and more humane than the exaggerated, artificial, and too often hysterical voicings of Thomas Horn. If every relative of 9/11 victims reacted like that, the whole nation would have collapsed by now.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

To start, Thomas Horn's acting is incredible, considering this is his first acting role- he plays the character of oskar so well, showing how people cope with grief differently, and how children with autistic traits view the world. The story line is interesting - and being based around the 9-11, it is relatable for a lot of people. Obviously, with the film being based on such a traumatic event, the story is emotional, but with enough funny and light hearted parts, to keep it form being too depressing. i wouldn't recommend it for children under the age of 13, because of some of the disturbing themes, such as how Oskar harms himself to try and help with his grief, although for older viewers it is a very good movie, and i would definitely recommend it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
227,christine-dreyer89,A healthy slice of brown bread from the film industry.,6,29 April 2012,"Where does one start...? Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was a tough one I tell you. The film follows the adventures and grieving of a young boy who has to deal with his father's unexpected death during the 9/11- attacks. I believe the WORST thing that ever could have happened to this film was the nomination for the Best Picture Oscar. My apologies to Mr. Daldry (Director). Yes. Once a film is nominated for this award, everyone expects it to be the Mona Lisa of movies, and THAT is exactly why I think Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close shouldn't have been nominated. This is a perspective-film, and I think a lot of the people who watched it were duped into thinking that it HAD to be THE GREATEST thing since sliced bread. Sadly, when it turned out to be brown bread instead of white it felt a bit, too, regular.The main character Oskar Schell (Horn) confused me for a long time – Oskar seems like a super weird nine-year old. He seemed to have annoyed a lot of people, which is a shame, seeing as they missed the point of the film because they were fixated on only one part of it. Regardless, I'm sure even seasoned actors would agree that his character was not an easy one to play! I would even go as far as saying that he should have been nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award. Young Haley Joel Osmont was nominated for his role as Cole Sear, the I-see-dead-people-kid from The Sixth Sense. I mean, really. Horn would probably not have won, but he seemed as if he had been acting much longer than what Max Von Sydow has. As the mime-like 'Renter', I believe Von Sydow's extraordinary talents were kept mostly covered-up. On the other hand, Horn screamed out his talent at the top of his lungs.Note that this film has a fictional storyline, but the ideas were developed within events which have really happened. The 9th of September 2001 was a day that meant different things to different people – some were involved physically, emotionally, mentally. Some were not involved at all. The negative reviewers on Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close were starving, and quick to tear into the flesh of the film for it's shallow portrayal of the 9/11 attacks and Horn's (apparent) poor acting. A tragedy like 9/11 can NEVER fully be reinvented for entertainment purposes. One could NEVER really see what happened, if you weren't part of the havoc which took place in New York, that day. I would think that making a film, which tries to depict EXACTLY what happened, would be much more devastating to mourning families, than this version of a young boy grieving over his father, Thomas (Hanks) and his mother Linda (Bullock) dealing with both the loss of her husband and her son's outbursts.This is a fresh outlook on the attacks which took place almost eleven years ago. I'm sure no disrespect was meant, and I urge people to watch the film as an ADVENTURE through death, grief and illness. When I put it like that, the brown bread doesn't seem that appetizing, it doesn't sound great. I'm not saying it is. But, I'm also not saying it's not. Above all, this film is just a story, about a boy, whose father helps him overcome life's trials and tribulations, even after his death.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
228,Transfiguration,Images with no substance,1,29 August 2012,"OK, so I get the fact Oskar is somewhat Aspergers/Autistic. Fine. Guh...I don't even know how to review this film because it did nothing but annoy the crap out of me. It seemed the only point of the film was to create interesting images, composition wise.......effectively making what could have been a silent film. New Yorkers letting a random annoying kid into their homes, being an intrusive little sh**, then taking their pictures (on an old camera that somehow gives him a print the very same day....same day developing you say?....its a stretch), New Yorkers aren't that inviting, even post 9/11. Why would Oskars mother NOT check the answerphone and ask her son if there were any messages? He switched the machine at least a day later. Why would Oskar fantasize about his father falling out of the tower when he watched the tower collapse live while hearing message 6 LIVE?!!Every time time I heard Oskar say ""the Worst Day"" I wanted to punch him.

When that happens we try to find reason and meaning in what has happened. But sometimes as much as we may try, its hard to find one, as hardly there is any. Still we will keep searching. The search is not wrong. But not letting to have peace with it is. I don't want to speak much about the story in detail as you will eventually see it( i will strongly recommend that) but i sure will like to shed some light on what i got form it. To most of my understanding this wonderful movie is trying to convey this message in a more beautiful manner. This story tell you about a kid who is logical and smart. he is courageous and scared at the same time. He is trying to be in peace with what happened. In search of that he is ready to go the extents required. It also tells you about the complex but delicate role a family plays in one's life. Its shows the love of a mother. A determination of man to punish himself for the wrong which he did. It a lot of things served in a single plate. The most to be admired is the relentless try of a kid to hold on to his fathers memory and in the same time how all his family tries their best to help him in his pursuit. It also talks about how strangers can connect and make us feel as a part of a big family. The most what i like is the way it ended. That's the charm.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The story had high predictability and the reveals were surprisingly unspectacular.The main character was a young boy searching for a lock for the mysterious key he finds in his deceased father's closet. The only clue this kid has is a scrawled name ""Black"" on the envelope that holds the key.The child goes on a mission to visit every ""Black"" in the city of New York trying to find a clue to his father's Wait, what exactly is he doing? I wonder. Oh yes, trying to find his eight minutes with his father. No, that still doesn't make sense. I suppose what his true mission was to find some sort of sense for his father's death, but to me it seemed he was looking in all the wrong places. Not once for believability's sake did the boy bother to ask his mother the origin of the key. No, he would rather walk (because he's afraid of public transportation) around the city of New York, (sometimes in really dorky pajamas) visiting complete strangers and going into their homes in order to ask them all about his father and their life story. The kid spends a lot of time drawing on maps, and pasting very photographic images into his composition book which has perfect calligraphy as headers for each page.The child actor was poor at delivering the emotional scenes, so I was laughing at rather unfunny material. I kept wondering if the boy got beat up a lot at school because he was so terribly unrealistic and strange even for a character, but never mind that because apparently school is out and even though everyone asks why he isn't in school, his lame excuses are apparently enough for both the people asking and the school board who must surely be marking his name full of absences.And while the child and his father were nuts enough; strange apparently runs in the family, with his grandmother talking on a walkie-talkie to her grandson whenever they please (apparently whoever wrote the story does not know how quickly batteries run out of walkie-talkies that or the boy has calculated every second that he must change them. However, like him attending school, this is never seen either.) The deaf man in the story who is constantly writing notes never runs out of paper either. Seems awfully lucky, but I still thought the tattooed ""YES"" and ""NO"" on the palms of each hand was a pretty cool idea. Over-all I found the story to be quite incomplete, with many letdowns and dropped opportunities for better material. Perhaps what the boy was truly searching for was a better story than his own, because his wasn't very interesting at all.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

It started off slow, giving NO indication as to what it was about OR where it was going! My g/f said to me ""Oh I think this is a kid's movie"". I told her NOT to 'review' it just yet! THEN, the reference to 9/11 was made by Oskar, and I said, ""A-ha, NOW we see where this is going"". From then on I watched this wonderful, (that word again), performance by Thomas Horn, an actor I'd not heard of beforehand. Thomas is 14/15, (born 1997) in real life, but in the movie supposedly plays a 9yo. (This I found a little hard to swallow!). However, his performance as Oskar is excellent! He IS the movie. Odd fact, Thomas speaks 'fluent Croatian'. (As he is Californian, I wonder HOW that benefits him at school).Tom Hanks, an actor I have long admired was spot-on AND,(my children will definitely think reaching 50 has changed my demeanor), I (actually) liked Sandra Bullock....her performance as Oskar's mum was quite brilliant! Wonderfully surprising and under-stated! Irish movie fans will notice Fr. Ted's, 'Bishop Brennan' (Jim Norton), in a 'blink and you miss it' scene.....The movie definitely deserves it's Oscar nomination for Best Pic, (no 'K'), and Max Van Sydow is definitely overdue the recognition of the Academy!

Tried reading the book first, but gave up after 10-15 pages. It just didn't resonate with me. Maybe the style, maybe something else, don't know.The movie is a totally different story - watched all 2 hours without looking away. I'm not an emotional man, but, have to admit, this movie had me chocking back tears many times. Very emotional story, excellent acting, attention to details.

235,greg-1260,This movie will stay with me for the rest of my days.,9,17 February 2012,"At thirty minutes in I was wondering who would be the first to leave the small audience in the cinema. By the end of this movie I, and the few others, simply sat with our metaphorical mouths agape at the impact of what we had just seen. A slow, meandering, and with hindsight, entirely necessary beginning gives way to a riveting and gripping story. A story which you would expect to bring you to tears (and it will for some) but is ultimately about triumph. It may appear to be a story about 9/11 and such was the enormity of that event that it would be easy to suggest that this is just an excellently acted and well-crafted story about that day. That would be to undersell this movie. 9/11 is just the vehicle which carries the message of how our everyday, minor irritations with other people and our general lives are simply unimportant in comparison to the reality that most people are just trying to do their best in our jobs, our marriages and in our relationships. We are imperfect and the enormity of 9/11 hammered that home. These couple of hours repeats the exercise. But this movie does more than use the day's story in such a simplistic way. Rather, it weaves the tragedy into the story of lives that are already living with sadness and it allows those participants to view their personal tragedies in the context of the much bigger one. To use the ""device"" of a compulsive child (what a performance!)forces us voyeurs to focus more clearly on the everyday minutiae which both he and we come to see as insignificant.

I will hope for the best for him, as he has potential to become a good actor if he wants to continue into it. Lastly, I can say that this movie was a decent film to be included in the whole World Trade Center category. Sure, some people will think it will be good, others will think that it will suck.

241,m-p-williams,Extremely Annoying & Incredibly Crass..,2,29 February 2012,"'Out of the blue' is one way of describing Stephen Daldry's tale of a grieving boy struggling to come to terms with the death of his father during the September 11th terrorist attacks. Perhaps the most interesting notion is how suddenly it came to prominence with not one, but two, Oscar nominations (Best Picture and Supporting Actor). Adapted from a novel; Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) pens a screenplay that solely aims to evoke emotional tension using 9/11 as the story's premise.Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close focuses on Oskar (Thomas Horn); an irritatingly prim boy with suggested Asperger's syndrome, which proves a defining element in both character and plot, as the youngster struggles to accept the death of his father played by Tom Hanks. Discovering a key and a cryptic clue in his dad's closet, Oskar embarks on a mission to uncover the location of the lock, in the hope of seeking closure to his painful suffering.The biggest problem here is a combination of two things: firstly using 9/11 as a basis for a film is not unusual (see World Trade Centre et al), but rather than as a mere backdrop, it explicitly tries to evoke horrendous memories relating to that day, rather than create an independent story. Through conversation or flashback we are constantly reminded of September 11th and how relentless it was - as if we didn't know.The second flaw is the way Oskar is portrayed. An effort to create a naive, fragile soul that has mental health issues as well as trauma complexities is a difficult task, and fails to work on the basis that we are encouraged to sympathise: one moment, a poignantly articulate narrator gradually begins to generate some audience engagement, but is instantly banished when the obnoxiousness of a foul-mouthed brat rears his head. Little annoyances build up; for example, when he embarks on a 25th Hour style monologue that feels like it goes on for all eternity, and then some.The extreme sentimentality of the piece is unlikely to faze the sceptics amongst us, but on a basic level the moments of embrace, tenderness and loss will indeed strike a chord with some viewers. However, for the most part it is a shameless plug for a stateside patriotism that in fact generates a lot of prejudice, hatred and anger in relation to the forceful reminder of 9/11.Using terrorism as the basis for Oskar's heartache is unnecessary. His father could have died in a hundred other ways on a thousand different days if the filmmakers so wished, but instead decide to target the single most devastating moment of the past twenty years in an obvious attempt to engage its audience. Were the narrative to be about a man who dies in a car crash, void of Hollywood heavyweights Bullock and Hanks, would anyone batter an eyelid, let alone gift Oscar nominations?This leads us to another factor: the supporting role of Max von Sydow. A talented actor, having been in some excellent movies over the decades; his inclusion as an ageing German mute doesn't lift the film to a newer or more respectable height, as his character proves terribly gimmicky and ultimately irrelevant in the scheme of the plot, too.VERDICT: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is awfully crass at times as it goes straight for the jugular at every opportune moment. Hanks and Bullock have small roles, allowing von Sydow to step in and offer an interesting, yet contrived contribution. Its inclusion as a Best Picture contender is baffling, and can only be credited with such due to reasons of a political nature, because there's nothing here that justifies association with any awards.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

But after his dad dies, he sneaks into his closet and accidentally finds a little envelope with the word ""Black"" written on it and a key inside.So Oskar sets off, for the better part of a year in search of anyone and everyone last named black, basically going door to door (which I always thought was dangerous).

But number one, he's very young and going through a really intense time in his life, and number two, he has autism.

Despite this he really is able to connect to people who are hurting or have experienced loss. The movie really deals a lot with the human experience. Our connections with others, the stories behind each human life, making sense out of tragedy and coping with intense emotional pain. This is done in a highly artistic and moving way. That alone should have left the film with at least an 7.5 rating.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
245,tphilpott,Excellent film on a difficult subject,9,19 September 2013,"This is an incredibly difficult story to tell and Stephen Daldry pulls it off magnificently. Eric Roth did a phenomenal job adapting the book by Jonathan Safran Foer (which I haven't read, but would now like to). Alexandre Desplat did an beautiful job with the score, which was touching and appropriate for a major film of this calibre. While it was clearly a major studio picture, lacking the grit of an independent film, it also had substance that can often seem lacking in this regard, I differ from a number of critics who panned the film's apparent lack of substance. The story is somewhat incredulous, especially when his mother turns out to have been following him for his journey, and then there is the very obvious note from his father at the end. But I forgave this given that this is supposed to be a film about hope in times of despair and the greatness that can be found in each of us - it did not sink into the clichéd devices that Spielberg often finds himself using. I was especially touched the scene near the end when his mother finds his incredibly touching book where he depicts his father falling from the tower.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

And now I am starting to have a ""deja vu"" feeling watching American films digesting the theme of 09-11. I do empathize with the grief and loss of the American people, but sometimes it comes a little bit too much. Other than that this is an excellent movie, and the actors were very convincing, especially the young Thomas Horn. The latter was so good that I disliked his character throughout, or may be not exactly ""disliked"", but had a mixed feeling of irritation during his mostly awkward a-la-Asperger syndrome behavior. I liked the film a lot because of the personal level it had mixed in the global anti-terror agenda.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Thank God I did not see this in theaters, I would have walked out quite possibly. The boy, who is the main character is completely not likable! In fact, he behaves like a complete a-hole for more than 80% of the film, which makes you want to literally strangle him! This is not a good thing in a movie where you should feel bad for the kid. It might not be the fault of the actor, perhaps that was the vision of the director, I don't know, but that is how I felt and all around me. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are great as always, but they are not central in the film. I think the Grandfather is the best in the cast! He pulls the movie to a different level.

I also did like Thomas Horn's acting as this is his first film and he's I think 11?

Then, slowly over the span of the film, little connections begin to pop up as you begin to make sense of it all. I loved every moment of the film. There are ups, and downs, and everything in between, and even if you have never experienced exactly what Oskar experiences, you feel connected to his character, and you feel just as motivated to resolve his quest as he is.

No way does a city dweller simply open their home to some strange thirsty kid who knocks at the door.What were the odds the word ""black"" on the manila envelope was a person's name anyway? Then to deduce the number of people named ""Black"" is limited to only those listed in the New York City phone book? No Blacks live upstate, on Long Island, or in New Jersey? And what about the unlisted Blacks?? Besides, Thomas Schell had meetings on the 106th floor of the WTC. This alleged person named Black could've lived anywhere in the world!The kid's specious deductions render illogical the entire premise of the story. Yet, after all the running around New York City seeking out as many Blacks as possible, it turns out the one he was searching for was the very first he visited!! That's intellectually insulting enough, but then we're told that his mother visited all these many people named Black beforehand to prepare them for his visit?? Wow. One can suspend disbelief for only so long.Then there's the fact that noticeably missing from this story is a PSYCHIATRIST! Both mother and child would be in desperate need of one even if only for their tragic loss. But Oskar has issues beyond that. How is it that no one ever thought to perhaps get this kid some cognitive therapy and medical treatment for his many phobias and social disabilities? A trained professional who can help eliminate that tambourine.Add to all this that as irritating as Oskar is due to whatever has rendered his brain a little wonky, the actor portraying him is so terrible that virtually nothing he says with emotion is believable. He's so bad, you literally don't feel for his character or the situation. He's not even a New Yorker, for goodness sake. I'm sorry, but even putting aside all the other ridiculousness, choosing Thomas Horn to play the lead role of Oskar made this film virtually unwatchable.

I found this to be a particularly emotional and moving film, while finding other parts of the movie quite confrontational and off-putting. The premise of a 9-11 themed fictional film aims to emotionally draw the viewer through sequences such as the 'falling man' jumping out of the World Trade Center... This didn't seem entirely tasteful. On the other hand the themes this movie presents, particularly encouragement of social interaction for a child with autism as well as celebration of the memory of those we have lost, bring a comforting and uplifting presence to the film, reminding the viewer that while it may seem to be a coercing tear-jerking, the movie's major cause lies in the journey taken by the lead character.

That said, the whole cheesy, middle-class paean to 9/11 that is this movie has ruined the Xmas season for me and, I suspect, for legions of others. The unusual soundtrack was worthwhile and interesting, but am unsure as who to cite; perhaps it is Debby VanPoucke, credited as sound designer. Wonderful NYC moments, however, allow for the 3 rating, those moments, of course, not including the 9/11 ones the filmmakers chose to shove in innocent moviegoers' faces.

I understand the young actor portraying a kid on the autistic spectrum did a good job, but I didn't find the character engaging; in fact, I found him the opposite. Max Von Sydow's character of the mute was more engaging than the boy. The story, though dealing with a tragic theme (loss of a parent), didn't draw me in or hook me. I simply kept watching just to see what would happen and wondering when it would end. Even the ending didn't move me or cause me to have feelings for the characters.

No action, nothing cinematic. Action, except for a few surprises late, never happens. The movie is about the people. They begin as interesting characters then become absolutely riveting.I saw the movie at an industry screening at New York's best theater, the Zeigfield.

256,pianocomposer,Incredibly Emotional And Amazingly Overlooked,9,1 April 2012,"On a whim, we crashed out in the living room and started looking through the on-demand movies we could rent after a fun day spent with our visiting niece, Michelle. We considered a couple of options before settling on this odd, post-9/11 film directed by Stephen Daldry (adapted from a book by Jonathan Safran Foer) about a family trying to recover from the loss of their father/husband, Thomas Schell, played with wit and charm by Tom Hanks. Sandra Bullock does a beautiful job of playing his grieving wife. After her husband dies, she becomes quiet and withdrawn, but spends a lot of energy and quality time with her semi- autistic son, Oskar, who is having a very bad time now that his father is gone. The son, played by Thomas Horn with a charming kind of honesty that only children can get away with, depended very much on his father's encouragement to meet people and interact with the world. The boy is filled with all kinds of social tics, phobias, and superstitions. He carries around an irritating tambourine wherever he goes, a strange fact that is never fully explained, now that I think about it.Poor Oskar grieves in his own strange way for a year before finally going into his father's closet (untouched since his death) and finds a mystery key inside a little envelope marked ""Black"". In an attempt to maintain a connection with the fading memory of his father, Oskar decides to find out what the key opens. He starts visiting everyone in the New York metropolitan area with the last name of Black. In the middle of his journey, his estranged grandfather, played by Max von Sydow, joins him on the quest. His grandfather is inexplicably mute, but writes notes of encouragement and helps young Oskar learn to overcome his fear of crossing bridges and taking public transportation. Von Sydow does a fantastic job without dialog by using his face and body to convey the emotional journey he is experiencing with his grandson as they try to literally unlock the mystery of the key.One of the biggest traumas of the entire film is the series of six voice mail messages that Oskar's father left before he died when one of the twin towers collapsed. The messages are clearly meant only for Oskar's ears, and the boy hid the message machine and replaced it with an exact duplicate just to spare his mother the grief of listening to these heart wrenching final expressions of love and loss. The sixth message, in particular, is difficult for Oskar to handle for reasons that you'll have to learn when you see the movie for yourself. When the movie was over, the three of us looked at each other and wondered why this wonderfully complex and emotional movie was beaten by the (clearly) inferior film, Hugo, which was nominated for (and won) several academy awards this year. Von Sydow was the sole recipient of a nomination, but he did not win the Oscar. We decided that director Martin Scorsese has more supporters in the industry. It's a shame, because the child actor in Hugo was not convincing, whereas Thomas Horn, who played the child in this film, seemed to capture the truth of the joy and suffering that his character endured. *SPOILER ALERT BEGIN * Oh, BTW: Towards the end of the film we finally discover what the key opens... and it had nothing to do with him or his family. There is another clue (associated with a swing set and a treasure map) that helps our intrepid explorer finally break through his sadness and reconnect to the world after his father has died. The ""key"" to the movie, in fact, is more about the journey than what Oskar actually found. It was the process of grieving and adjusting his perspective that was most important. * SPOILER ALERT END *p.s. After I wrote this review, I discovered that male critics tended to find this movie manipulative and irritating whereas female critics more often respond positively to it. The heart of the movie really is not rational... it is about emotional loss. So I guess if you hate movies with quirky characters that deliberately attempt to evoke powerful emotions, this one is not for you. The three of us, however, found it sad but wonderfully refreshing overall.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

He grows on you as you begin to understand him better, and by the end you realise he is perfect for the story line. The mother and 'the renter' were also well cast I thought.

Having lost a mother when I was at a similar age and having a disabled child, I could relate to the autistic, Oscar's agonising journey at coming to terms with his own grief. By the end of this excellent production, I realised that the movie conveyed pearls of universal wisdom. For example I saw striking parallels to some of the Buddhist teachings. These included the parable of the ""mustard seed"", facing and befriending one's fears and pain, interconnectedness, unconditional compassion and one's search often ending, at the most unexpected and yet, most obvious place.

He is a better actor than some adult actors I would believe. When that is said, there is some scene where it's obvious that he is just a kid. BUT he steals the show completely and WILL enter you heart so watch this with caution :-) Max Von Sydow performance is without words, and it just shows how great of an actor he truly is. He had captured my heart, and I cried with him throughout the film even when he didn't even speak a word! Other stars to mention is Sandra Bullock - she has a break-down scene with the young Oscar Schell and they fire up on each other. They make each other look great. However, when that said, I do not believe this is Sandra Bullocks best acting. Her role is simply not energetic enough for her to shine which is a shame. It's only few scenes that allows her to show how great of an actor she really is. All in all; this is a great movie to see, if you want your heart to pour out. It is sad, outstanding and a stunning piece of art. The only thing that I didn't like that much, is that the 9/11 fills too much. While 9/11 is both a positive thing to the film, it's also negative because they talk so much about it. It could be spared in some of the scenes. Yet, it still somehow is a great element in the movie.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Apparently one person's trash is truly another's treasure,10,23 March 2013,"I had wanted to see this since it first came out; and finally did.I don't know if it's because I know a lot of people with aspbergers/autism, if it's because I have a heart or because I understood the puzzle/connections, but what drove so many people crazy about this movie have me feel incredibly badly for them; as what they call overacting/obnoxiousness/being too old.... I truly did not see that way at all, and in fact was utterly blown away by almost everyone's performance.9/11 was a backdrop; and like a King's Speech, you take a person almost paralyzed with fears who has one person he trusts say it's going to be OK; and then have the worst fear realized. Autistic children have MANY incredibly steep phobias; so the fact this child faced all of them with courage and dogged determination and a scary intelligence, it is a sign of incredible intelligence, and for someone people talk about being unemotional; he shows that he wants to be deserving of his father's love and pride. This is not someone hate-able nor someone obnoxious; this is someone with courage against paralyzing fear; with mental monsters that would cripple most people; Max Von Sydow's character being another with similar.Sandra Bullock was incredibly real as a woman who wanted to connect with someone who was far from her, and hated himself for it. Without giving away anything; the character she portrayed showed incredible wisdom, heart and patience, while trying to be brave and stay out of his way. She did incredibly well with a very difficult role; and Viola Davis as always was amazing.For anyone who did not like it; I hope at some point they watch it again; through another set of eyes. If you like a King's Speech; it is similar courage he is facing; the child was INCREDIBLE in his courage, his doggedness, and he is aware in a very real way of people's emotions and how they feel in spite of his disorder, which shows that he is beyond typical in that disorder; he cares about the fact he should care more; and tries to make good.It was incredibly, incredibly moving; it was not overly emotional at all; it showed the terrifying, paralyzing monsters he faced while trying to make sense of the non-sensible... it was exactly what it should have been.I hope those who hated it give it another chance, while watching with a different set of eyes.Because it was magical... and it was incredible, and it was inspirational beyond belief.It was a life changer; every bit as much as Pay It Forward; only in a different way.LOVED it!

After much consideration, I decided that the trailer was completely misleading: leading me to believe it was a cheerful, inspirational tale of a boy going on a treasure hunt set out by his father soon before his untimely death. I was to believe that Tom Hanks - a favorite actor of mine - was going to have a huge part in this film. So, although the general story-line was accurate, I was not expecting the terrifyingly emotional roller-coaster that I ended up on. I still thoroughly enjoyed the film - I found it both devastating and uplifting in the best possible sense of each and Tom Hanks role seemed to embody all that I love about him and his work. Perhaps it was because I hadn't been expecting it to be so grounded in reality, but it left me an emotional wreck for a few hours and stayed with me over the next few days and weeks. Overall, it was surprisingly different from what I expected, but still amazing. It would've rated 10/10 if Tom Hanks had made more of an appearance.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

280,tkossler,This movie was a wonderful surprise to me,8,23 January 2012,"This movie was a wonderful surprise to me. This is not a typical Hollywood movie by any means. Extremely Loud is a fictional story about 9/11 and its impact on one family's loss. Not very many main stream films have been done about 9/11 and the aftermath, but this one is very well done.There is some wonderful acting performances in this film. Even though the film is quite long, it held my attention throughout the 2 hour and 9 minute runtime.Thomas Horn as 9 year Oskar Schell is really the main actor in the movie and he does a fantastic job, but he has just about the best supporting cast you could ask for. Max von Sydow as a man who does not speak is really amazingly good without saying anything at all. Sandra Bullock gives yet another touching performance as a mother as Oskar's mom Linda Schell. Tom Hanks is not even in the film very much, but he makes us believe Oskar's father was just the greatest Dad a kid could ask for. There are many other characters in the film that Oskar meets on his journey, and these secondary characters are very interesting as well.Overall I gave this movie an 8 out 10 because it was so well crafted by director Stephen Daldry and rich in texture. We are all challenged in life at some point to overcome great loss and to face our biggest fears. The 9 year old boy in this film gives us a powerful reminder of that.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Here is the bottom line : IF you are not an American and a fan of 9/11 movie theme then avoid this movie like plague.I waited and waited AND waited very patiently that the story will have me in grips any moment now but all in vain, it was so deadly boring that i could not bring myself to go on hoping.

282,j-kleinitz,An Extremely overwhelming and Incredibly heart-breaking movie,9,16 December 2020,"The movie ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" fits to the genre of drama and mystery. It´s based on the novel from Jonathan Safran Foer and is about the nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who's father ""Thomas Schell"" (Tom Hanks) died in 9/11. After finding a key in his dad's room he goes on a search for the lock and meets many different people, all with the last name ""Black"". Later on, the renter (Max von Sydow) joins the search and accompanies Oskar and his emotions. Throughout the movie there are several discussions between Oskar and his mother (Sandra Bullock), representing the personal difficulties of both characters dealing with the loss of a beloved person.Thomas Horn acts the protagonist Oskar Schell. He was 14 years old during the work at the film and played a nine-year-old boy, who suffers from the Asperger syndrome. Throughout the movie he acts the emotional outbursts and the despair after the death of his dad very well.Well underlined by the emotional acting of Max von Sydow, who wasn´t allowed to talk, because of his role as the renter, yet there is always a great emotional contrast between him and Oskar. A good reason why he should have received the Oscar for his performance!The movie focuses on the main characters of the book, but still covers every important character trait of the side characters like Ron or Dr. Fein in the novel. The only thing, which disappointed me during the movie, was leaving out the character of A. R. Black. Originally it´s him who joins Oskar on his search for the lock and symbolizes that the renter isn´t ready to be Oskar grandfather. Yet in the movie he seems to be right at the beginning.Furthermore, there are different leitmotifs in the movie compared to the novel like the swing on the playground. In the movie, the playground creates some kind of frame and gives the audience reasons for Oskar´s autism and the swing is kind of an explanation for Oskar´s fears. Also, the playground is connected to the relationship between Oskar and his father due to the last Reconnaissance Expedition, both are playing before the worst day. Speaking of the Reconnaissance Expedition, another good point is that it all comes to a satisfying end.To put it in a nutshell, the movie is a must see for everyone. It definitely deserved all his awards and the attention it got. But at the end it should be mentioned that if you are interested in the plot, you should first read the incredibly great novel and then watch this masterpiece of a movie.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
283,hessejens,A revolutionary film who should have been awarded with the Oskar,9,15 December 2020,"9/11, one of the most tragic days in human history.
Extremely loud and incredibly close, a revolutionary movie, based on the novel and the happenings of 9/11. Oskar who lost his father during 9/11, tries to solve the last quest of his father.
On his quest to find this solution Oskar meets many people and with that learns to overcome his fears and to begin a new life as well as to get rid of his trauma of the loss of his father.Oskar, who is played by Thomas Horn, is a really interesting and complex character and perfect election for this movie like. Furthermore, Thomas Horn plays the role of this rather unusual nine- year-old boy really good. He shows the character traits and fears of Oskar in a really convincing way, especially the violent outbursts, in connection to his autism, are really poignant.
But not just the role of Oskar is played well in the movie, also the father, played by Tom Hanks, and the Grandfather (Max von Sydow), build up the base of this well made movie.
The convincing story is presented in a straight way but leaves room for interpretations. The viewer is able to understand the whole story without reading the book. Moreover the story line of the movie is more simple than the story line of the book and is easier to understand for the viewer. Especially the end of the movie fits more to the overall story. It represents Oskar's overcome of his fears and starting of a new life.
In comparison to other movies ""Extremely loud and incredibly close"" is a movie which is emotionally gripping and presented the trauma and grieve of Oskar in a really realistic way and not over dramatized way. Furthermore, this movie has many heart-rending moments which could make the viewer cry. For example the situation where his grandfather leaves him shows the trauma of Oskar in a way which is emotionally gripping.All in all this movie has changed my life. Now I am more able to understand the grieve of a child like Oskar who lost their parents in such a tragedy. Also the acting performances are extraordinary and represented the story in a really, really good way. But not all the glitter is gold: in my opinion this movie has also some weak points. For me the Grandmother, who played a really important role in the novel, isn't presented in the right way in the movie. She isn't important for the story of Oskar in the movie at all and is with that the opposite of person in the novel.
To put it in a nutshell, I would give this movie 8,5/10 stars because of some weak points, but this movie must be seen.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
284,emilyschmidt-84210,A movie portraying 9/11 from a complete new angle,9,15 December 2020,"Handsomely polished, thoughtfully wrapped Hollywood production about the national tragedy of 9/11 that seems to have forever redefined words like unthinkable, forgivable, catastrophic. - Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times.
This fitting quote shows our impression after first watching the movie. It distinguishes itself by its authenticity and the convincing acting performance of Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Max von Sydow and Thomas Horn.
The movie Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is about a nine-year-old boy called Oskar whose father died on 9/11. Through his quest of searching the key he found he found in his father's closet, the boy tries to stay close to his father a little longer.
He finds the key in an envelope with the name Black written on it hidden in a blue vase. His plan is to meet every single person in New York City with the last name Black to ask them if they know anything about the key or if they know his dad Thomas Schell. Throughout that he needs to fight many fears like his fear of high buildings partly caused by the fact that he is suffering from PTSD and the Asperger syndrome. In addition he makes friends with the renter of his grandmother with whom Oskar continues his search.
Considering the acting performance of the main characters played by the already mentioned actors, one can say that none of the roles was an easy one to play. Especially the amazing performance of Max von Sydow (the renter) was worth an Academy Award nomination due to his way of conveying through his facial expressions since his character wasn't able to speak.
The fourteen year old Thomas Horn playing the nine year old Oskar Schell had a tough time acting a character suffering from PTSD and Asperger. As a consequence on one hand he has to deal with the typical character traits of a young boy and on the other hand he had to embody the significant symptoms of a traumatized authist. Especially the emotional outbursts of the boy should have been a great challenge for the young actor.
Then there is Tom Hanks playing the father of Oskar. He authentically embodied the vivid and intelligent man communicating with his son having autism through over-exaggerated mimic and gestures.
Last but not least there is Sandra Bullock to be seen as the mother of Oskar. Compared to Thomas Horn and Max von Sydow her role was rather small but nonetheless important. As for the other actors as well her acting was outstanding too when it comes to her emotional performance. Especially in the end you can find some really emotional scenes between a mother and her son dealing with the loss of a loved one.
As somebody who has also red the novel to the movie I can say that they did a great job when it comes to the way they handled all the difficulties and solved the problems appearing when transferring a book into a movie.
The producers needed to cut down and narrow in the storyline to make it understandable. For instance they cut down a total of three narratives in the novel to only one perspective in the movie. They did a great job there because even though some aspects were missing due to the narrowing in, the essence of the story is still recognizable for the viewer. Through symbolic places and actions like the swings on the playground they still conveyed the main message in an elegant way.
To put it in a nutshell it's a great job that has been done with the whole movie. No matter if it comes to the actors or the storyline. Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is definitely worth watching.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
285,maksbogachenkov,"Cool actors, cool story, nice to watch",7,16 December 2020,"I could have never imagine that such a book with so less attracting attention can provide that amount of emotions and complicated thoughts. The polarizing story of the book is able to shock even a emotionally stable person, because it transports the reader into another world of the tragic event.Generally the film ""Extremely Loud and Incredible Close"", directed by Stephen Daldry in 2012, deals with a nine years old boy named Oskar. A child who is mentally unstable caused by the terrorist attack on 9/11. One of the victims was his father, who was an important part of Oscars life. It makes Oskar sick and traumatised. That´s the reason why he tries to come closer to his dad in the course the search for the lock.To begin with the actors I have to mention that Thomas Horn did an excellent job portraying the protagonist. Everybody who is not able to recognise this perfect reconstruction of a autistic child who suffers from the consequences of the most horrible event of that time, should shut up and be quiet. It is festinating how sensitive you can feel the emotions of Oskar in different situations. These can paralyze the reader when he becomes a part of the story by listening. Stephen Daldry did also an extremely great job in how he let the actors fit perfectly in Oskars life and suffers. As a real example you see that Max von Sydow, who acted the renter in the movie, got a nomination for a real Oscar as the best supporting actor.Furthermore it´s pleasant to to see how the actors of the movie interact with each other. Their relationships are based on real feeling and are mostly relatable to the real life. Also Oskars parents have shown to the reader how different and hard it is to treat a complicated child with autistic syndrome.Another point is that the movie includes a lot of flashbacks which make it for the reader more possible to reproduce the emotions of the people who lost their loved person.Personally for me, the storyline of the movie could have been more diversified. All over it´s only about a 9 years old boy who searches for the unknown and finds almost nothing at the end: In my view the producer could create a better film with such a cast of actors.Although the main part of the movie wasn´t so active and stimulating, there was a closed ending with an instructive solution of the problem. It made the viewer think about the own life more closely.To put it in a nutshell I´m absolutely convinced that the movie won´t be a waste of your free time. A lot of emotions, the real-story-background and professionals actors shape the movie for a pretty Sunday afternoon.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
286,josi-21594,A sad and touching story of a young boy trying to connect himself with his death father,8,16 December 2020,"The movie ""Extremely loud and Incredibly close"" published in 2011, deals with the events of 9/11 and the consequences for a young boy, who lost his father during the attack. Right from the beginning the tragic story is able to generate my emotions. Due to their brilliant interpretations of their roles, it was easy to emphasize with the characters and to understand their feelings, which makes the happenings even more emotional. Although the roles were really hard to play, it seemed as if the actors are really able to identify with their characters. The facial expressions and gestures of the renter and the untypical and mature characteristics of the nine-year-old protagonist ""Oskar"" (Thomas Horn) make the story line very special and unique. It shows how young children are forced to give up their childhood and find themselves confronted with tragedies and the loss of beloved persons. The movie shows the process of grief and development of a young boy called Oskar, who lost his father at 9/11 and is now trying to overcome this pain and loss by questing for the suitable lock for the key he has found in the closet of his dad.
Particularly the fact that Oskar tries to find ways to build up a connection to his death father, because he misses him a lot, was really touching, because it shows how a young boy tries to deal with a bad stroke of fate. Many scenes of the movie show how helpless Oskar is and tries to cope with the loss, but can't find a way to overcome this pain, especially the part, when Oskar hurts himself, which makes me really emotional, because it shows his desperateness and helplessness. I think it is really important to include this part, because it demonstrates what tragic consequences the death of beloved persons can have on a person.
Moreover, the different methods Oskar tries as well as the meetings with the Blacks, show how strong the love and connection to his father was and how painful the death is for Oskar. In connection to this I really liked the development of Oskar, which is pretty shown in the movie, from a shy and introverted boy to a more open-minded and self-conscious boy, really impressed me and is really inspiring, especially for those, who are in a similar situation. Through the interaction with other people and the quest for the suitable lock, he overcome his boundaries and got to know new people, as well as the renter, who helped him to go through the pain and the hard time and to solve the secret for the key.
It was a chaos of emotions, in some scenes you were emotionally touched, other scenes left you shocked, again others inspired you and gave you hope, for example when Oskar coped with the loss of his dad. I think it is really helpful and you can identify with Oskar, because the emotions were so tangible and the death of a loved one is something that can happen to each of us every day. Especially the way they present the process of grief shows that everyone has his own way to cope with the loss of something and it is totally fine to take time and do things that are good for you. In general, the movie was full of emotions and actions making you overthink your life and the way we often take our family and friends for granted. Particularly when Oskar has one of his emotional outbursts, it shows his trauma and how horrible it is to lose someone so close to you. When thinking about persons in the same situation as the protagonist, I can imagine that this movie might help and support them, as it demonstrates them, that they aren't alone and that it is totally fine to mourn and to take your time to cope with your loss.
All in all, it can be said that the Oskar's way of dealing with his loss is very inspiring and impressive. He finds relief by finding the suitable lock and thereby feels a connection to his father, making it possible for him to accept his death. Personally, I learned a lot from the movie, as it showed, that mourning is normal and a part of our life. Oskar's development reminds us that bad times will pass by and even if at some point it seems as if we will never be happy again, good times will follow and after a certain time we will be able to live with our loss.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
287,amysabel,Extremely Emotional & Incredibly hard not to cry,8,16 December 2020,"""It´s hard to say goodbye to the place you´ve lived. It can be as hard as saying goodbye to a person."" - this quote stayed in my mind after watching this emotional movie.
""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" deals with different fatal blows and problems. The main character Oskar loses his father during 9/11, his grandma and grandfather had to leave their hometown Dresden because of World War II and they split up, his mother is a single parent from now on with her autistic son. That is literally enough to call this a drama movie!
I guess everyone can identify at least a bit with one of the special life stories and that is what makes the movie special for me.
Tom Hanks embodies Thomas Schell, as the loving father of Oskar, who spends a lot of time to keep Oskar happy and busy with exploring the world.
Sandra Bullock completes the famous parent-duo, but only plays a bigger role towards the end of the film, when Oskar solved his fathers last riddle. Throughout the film he thinks that she is not interested in him and his actions, but secretly she knew everything and secretly support her son to get the task finished faster/easier.
I think the riddle-thing is a cute father-son activity which brings them both together and creates beautiful childhood memories.
You can actually feel how detached Oskar is after he solved the last riddle and how he starts a new chapter in his life without his father in the end of the movie. I like that since I know that there are many people who have comparable problems right now and no hope of improvement. This scene or rather the whole movie shows that there is always another way out of any problem.
I also read the book and I really liked the movie better. The movie is easier to understand, there are no misunderstandings and too long sections from the book are cut out. But if you liked the film a lot and want to get more details, the book is perfect for you! Especially when you want to get to know the characters better.
But if you are a big fan of special effects then this movie is not the right one for you.
This film works without any special effects or cuts, because what should be in the foreground is the emotional story and it does not need emotional support.
All in all I would recommend the movie to everyone who has also experienced some fatal blows or knows somebody who lived trough them!
Have fun watching and share your opinion too! Do you agree with me?",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
288,daumsraphael,"Book extremely sad, movie incredibly good",7,16 December 2020,"Fascinating and surprising.
The film, extremely loud and incredibly close, tells the story Oskar Schell, a nine-year-old autistic boy who loses his father during the World Trade Center terrorist attack. After his death, Oskar finds a secret key hidden in his father's closet. He sets off in search of the lock the key matches and meets many new people. Oskar also learns more about his grandparents and their previous life. In the end, however, only the relationship to his mother and father and the young autistic person's handling of the trauma he has experienced are important.
The film is based on the book of the same name and was written by Jonathan Safran Foer. Compared to the book, there are many differences, which become clear in the film. The end was very disappointing, especially the resolution of the search seems rather pointless and takes a long time to build up without any real tension. However, the film deals with the 9/11 topic as well as the consequences of the victims very vividly.
Thomas Horn embodies the role of Oskar Schell in a brilliant way, because he had to deal with specific character traits like autism or the trauma of his dad's death. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock add a finishing touch to the film, as both play their roles excellently, as you know it from other of their movies. Throughout the whole film you are feverishly involved with Oskar and put yourself in the role of Oskar.In summary, I would say that the film is recommended for people interested in American drama, but not for book lovers who have read the book and liked it.

289,yasminebakhouche,Beautiful story of a young autistic boy that was perfectly implemented into a film,9,16 December 2020,"Crying, falling and dying people. The victims faced these horrific experiences at the tragedy of the 11th September 2001, also known as 9/11. But also, the relatives of the affected people have to deal with the following trauma, such as grief, loss or anxiety. Just as the protagonist Oskar Schell who has lost his father, Thomas Schell, during the terroristic attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. The movie ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" which is directed and published by Stephen Daldry in 2012 shows the viewer how the family Schell deals with Thomas's death. Let's take a closer look on the plot and how it is converted into this film drama.
One year, after the death of Oskar's father, the nine-year-old boy finds a key hidden in blue vase on top of his father's dresser. The only information Oskar gets is a labeled envelope with the name ""Black"". Therefore, Oskar holds on to the thought that his father has left an important message to him behind the lock, which leads him to his search: Finding the lock in which the key fits. Oskar spends months on meeting the Blacks in alphabetically order and coping his father's loss.
Now, what about the movie, actors and technical elements? The role of the main character Oskar Schell is filled by Thomas Horn. At the time of the film making he was only 14 years old. He made a very good job at representing the autistic and traumatized boy because of his facial expressions, body language and telling the audience his thoughts and feelings. Thus, it is better to understand the complex plot of the whole story which leads me to the next aspect. The order is comprehensible, the movie starts and ends with the falling man (Thomas Schell), only the most important things were mentioned and the irrelevant scenes did not take much time. For example, the sixth messages on the answering machine were distributed in the course of the whole movie, just like Jonathan Safran Foer did in the novel. Therefore, the messages are the leitmotif in the film, the viewer can simply follow the scheme. About the other actors Tom Hanks who played Oskar's father and Sandra Bullock who represented the character of the mother, there is actually nothing to complain as well. Their acting was convincing and the chemistry between these two and to the main character Oskar Schell seemed pretty perfect. Another thing is the technical side: Sound, lightning and the camera resolution were of the highest quality and the cuts between the scenes were put suitable so that the ""tension"" stayed in place.
Beside all these good aspects there are also negative points that should be mentioned. Firstly, the grandparents' story is not included so we cannot know why the grandma and the renter do not want that Oskar tells the other one about each other's conversation. Of course, this is also something to praise because of the fact that all of this extra information of Oskar's grandparents is more likely a load for the audience to process. Secondly, the important character Mr. A. R. Black is missing. Not only as a reader of the novel, but also as a watcher of the movie the connection between the protagonist and the Black can be build up to have a better imagination for Oskar's current state of feelings and health. Unfortunately, in the novel, the message of this story is to say ""I love you"" whenever there is the right moment and time to even say it but in the movie, this major point was not really observed.
Nevertheless, I think with a look on the total package of the movie, it came out very good. The themes like terror, love, guilt, self-harm etc. were appropriately presented. Even though, there are some deviations, it does not change the plot. The ending is emotional and leads the reader to thinking about the real meaning of family and coping strategy. For that reason, the movie deserves four of five stars.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
290,moritzwoll,Extremely tear jerking and incredibly sketchy,7,16 December 2020,"A nine-year-old boy with Asperger's and PTSD roams around around NYC to find the lock fitting to a random key. Sounds boring, absolutely isn't!
The movie ""Extremely Loud And Incredible Close"", is produced by Stephen Daldry and was published in 2011.
Almost every of the 130 minutes is full of pain, love and tension. Based on Jonathan Safran Foer's eponymous novel, Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) loses his father, Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks) while the terror attack of 9/11. He immediately starts to close himself off to his mum, a mysterious subtenant of his German grandmother becomes his partner for the goal he made himself up: finding out what the key, he found in his father's closet, fits to and what this has to do with his father. On his journey he meets several different people and learns new important things every single day. At first the subtenant supports him, but later on Oskar becomes too challenging and he stops being his helping hand.In contrast to the book, Oskars 11th September is described more detailed and much sadder to us in the movie. His day's meeting all the Blacks are much more detailed and a much bigger spectrum of different types is showed. The ending with all the Blacks is very sweet and tear jerking. Oskar wrote a letter to them and they all get emotional and so gets the viewer. It is really nice, that the roots of the grandmother are also shown in her German accent. The actor of the grandfather (Max von Sydow) shows his emotional trauma through his acting really good. Trough this stylistic devices the development of the main character gets easier to understand, for the viewer. It also makes the viewer emotional in a good way. The ending is also really emotional and makes the viewer kind of happy.Sadly, the second storyline of the novel is missing, no Dresden, except of the accent, no WW II, no meeting in Delhi, no strictly ruled apartment and no grandfather trying to leave several times. In our opinion left out potential, even though the movie already has excess length. For this and for the fact, that Oskars father told him, that he loves him on the answering machine, which literally destroys Oskars reason for wanting to find out more about his dad.Alone the great acting skills of the actors from Oskar (Thomas Horn) makes the movie worth to watch. Just let the movie affect you and don't think too much about the little details!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
291,krdaniels,A very sweet story about love and connection.,9,28 January 2012,"I found this film to be a very sweet story about an autistic boy struggling to hold onto his father after losing him on 9/11. For anyone who has lost someone suddenly and without reason, this tale will resonate. Thomas Horn was brilliant in his role, and I suspect we will see more of him in years to come. Sandra Bullock, though only having less than twenty minutes of screen time, was touching and believable. Tom Hanks, who had even less screen time, made us care about him, and understand how profoundly his absence will be felt by his son, wife, mother and even his absent father. Oskars quest takes him all over New York, on a mission to solve a mystery he thought was left by his father, only to discover that his quest provided healing and comfort to strangers all over the city.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
292,marcopchen,2 out of 4 stars,5,29 January 2012,"I only watched Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, because it was nominated for Best Picture this year. I was very surprised, because the movie only has 46% positive reviews at the moment. Apparently, this is the worst reviewed movie to have been nominated for the prestigious award. Interestingly enough, the second lowest rated movie was The Reader at 62%, also directed by Stephen Daldry. The Academy must love this guy or something. I looked at Eric Roth's resume, and I like what I see. He recently wrote The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, one of my favorite movies. Maybe then, the source material was the reason why this movie was pretty unbearable for me. It's usually pretty hard to adapt books. I never read the book, though, but I hate that title. For a good amount of the movie, I was looking away or covering my face, because it was too nauseating to watch. I guess it was the kid, Thomas Horn, who kept making me cringe. There's a lot of screaming in this movie from him, and it's very irritating. I always admit bias, and I have never experienced a close death. However, other critics have also pointed how the situations the kid is put in seem forced, which I totally agree with. The kid is a very unlikable character. I guess that's another reason why I find it hard to enjoy the movie. It's hard to feel sorry for him when he's acting all crazy. I really hated it when he curses at the doorman, who didn't do anything. The premise is so strange and silly that I don't really want to follow this character in his journey. He randomly finds a key and decides to walk around NYC to find somebody who can be connected to it. Are you kidding me? He's living in a delusion. Another thing, how does he get around without public transportation? NYC is not a small town. I was kind of surprised that Max von Sydow was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He didn't speak, and I felt like he wasn't in the movie much. He was the most interesting character, but his story wasn't really concluded. He left before we could find out more about him. The whole story just seemed ridiculous to me, and I know I wasn't the only one. Roger Ebert said it seemed like a fairy tale, and I think that is a perfect description. Another big problem for me is that I feel like the movie exploits the 9/11 tragedy. Does the father dying in the towers really move the story any better? He could have died any other way. A more inexplicable way to die would be some terminal illness like a cancer. You see, a theme of the movie is that some things such as 9/11 can't be explained. I really felt the exploitation when the movie showed images of a man falling or jumping out of the towers. The thing that really drives this exploitation thing home for me is that the kid introduces himself as a son of a 9/11 victim to everybody. Of course, it's going to be sad when a kid constantly brings up that his father died in that awful tragedy. I wanted to give the movie a lower rating, but I can't really say it's a bad movie. To give it less than 2 out of 4 stars would be doing just that. My favorite part of the movie is towards the end with Sandra Bullock. It's too bad she wasn't in the movie more. Tom Hanks was hardly in the movie, too, but I liked him a lot in that role. I liked all the supporting cast, including John Goodman and Viola Davis, a contender for Best Leading Actress. I guess I'm saying that I like everybody in the movie, except for the main character, the annoying kid. Maybe, it wasn't a good idea to give a job like this to a kid without any acting experience. The whole movie, including the dialogue and everything about 9/11, seem to have all been done for Oscar bait. It'a hard not to feel somebody who has been affected by the worst tragedy in history, but even the kid's name is Oskar! Come on, now!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The actors all give it everything they've got and the adult performances are quite good. Max von Sydow totally deserved his Oscar Nomination and Sandra Bullock and Jeffrey Wright give possibly the best performances of their careers. But they can't save it. This story is simply one that should not have been made into a film. The 9/11 attacks are merely the setup for the plot to begin and are completely interchangeable with any tragedy ranging from a drunk driving accident to a natural disaster. The film has NOTHING to say about 9/11 and it merely serves as an gimmick to win sympathy of American audiences. I found it very VERY offensive and not even the genuinely likable performances can make up for it. The kid overacts in most of his scenes and the ending came across as phony, pointless and extremely pretentious. If you want to make a film that really deals with 9/11, pretentious is something you simply cannot be.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
295,dziggy1993,"One of the most poignant, powerful films I have seen",10,30 January 2012,"I walked into the theater expecting to see a relatively well made, very emotional film, which according to the reviews, I would either love or hate. When the two hour film was over I experienced something which I had never experienced before. As the credits started rolling and the lights were turned up, the theater stayed absolutely silent. Everybody stayed in their seats until all of the credits were through. There wasn't a dry eye in the entire audience and I didn't hear one peep out of anyone even as they exited the building. As I watched this happen, I realized that the film was still sinking in. It was still being processed by everyone in the audience including myself. Even after two days, I still cannot get my mind off of this film. I'm sure that if you're reading this review, chances are you've read others and know the basic plot of the movie. In that case, I won't bother to review it again. Instead I am going to focus on the raw emotion and talent exhibited in the film. Thomas Horn, who is in about 90% of the film cannot be described with words. I would say that he is a virtuoso and unequivocally talented, but I feel that it would not do him justice. I feel as if people who didn't appreciate his performance either didn't understand how complex Oscar's character is or they forgot that the film is told from Oscar's perspective. Because it is told form Oscar's perspective, there is sure to be what some would consider annoying or un needed inner dialogue. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock both have small, but vastly important scenes which immerse the viewer deeper into Oscar's world. The fact that the story is told from a child's perspective is what makes the film so poignant. It takes the audience back to a naive, child like mentality which soon witnesses one of the greatest catastrophes in history. I can say that some of Oscar's reactions to the attacks mimicked my own. I was 7 yrs old when 9/11 happened and I can remember how helpless and fearful I felt. Of course, I didn't lose a parent, but I did have trouble sleeping and I had a fear of loud airplanes. Overall, the film is life changing. It reminds us what is really important in life, and it gives us hope. It teaches the audience that anything is possible and that there is always someone who has got your back. I left the theater and called my parents the next day to tell them that I love them. It has that kind of a human impact that very few other movies have. I would recommend this film to everybody 10 out of 10",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
296,Yns01,"OK, but certainly not Oscar material",6,10 December 2011,"Just returned from a screening of this film. Thought it was just OK. Intermittently engaging, moving at times and at others mawkish, the film is not really about 9/11 but rather about how one child deals with the sudden loss of a parent. 9/11 is tangential to the story, and in some respects, one can argue that it is used here in a manipulative way in order to gain easy sympathy for the main character, who otherwise is a pretty irritating child. Shares many themes with the superior (and lighter) ""Hugo"". The acting here is top-notch but viewers should be aware that this is not a Tom Hanks movie. Mr. Hanks has a very small role. All of the name actors are in supporting roles to Thomas Horn, who plays the lead. Sandra Bullock also has a fairly small part. She is effective, although it's difficult to imagine a real mother in NYC allowing her son to wander around the city without adult supervision. Viola Davis is wasted in a very small part.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I thought it was remarkable, especially considering how difficult it must have been to transfer it from the page to the screen. JSF's book is absolutely gorgeous and unique and when I found out it was being made into a movie I was very hesitant to believe it could really be done, and done well. But, when I heard Stephen Daldry would be at the helm, I lost all doubt. I thought the film version of Extremely Loud was staggeringly beautiful and moving. The first time I saw it, I cried through most of it. I loved it so much, I went to see it again two days later. I think the boy who plays Oskar is the perfect re-imagination of the Oskar in the book. And I REALLY don't understand all of the curious and off-beat criticisms of the movie's ""version"" of 9/11. That's not what the movie is about. I repeat, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT 9/11 so I'm not really sure why people are getting so huffy about it. In fact, what is shown of 9/11, I thought, was very well done, tasteful, and respectful.

305,donttalkaboutmylife,I just couldn't bring myself to like it,2,22 March 2012,"I watched ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" after hearing my friend's recommendations and I was ultimately extremely disappointed with the movie. When I first read some online plot summaries about this movie, the story revolves around Oskar's search for the lock that fits the key his late father had left behind. Yet when I finally watched the movie, the taste of adventure was noticeably negligible. I was reasonably disappointed, but I couldn't fully attribute the movie's failure to my entirely misled expectations. There were more problems than that.One of the bigger problems was how the character played by Thomas Horn was portrayed – a tremendously annoying, self-centered, unlikeable, despicable, spoiled brat. He speaks foul language, has no manners, and simply does not care about people's feelings when he talks. I don't know if it was overacting or just the way the people who made it wanted it to be like, but the way Oskar threw accusations at people or condemned them, shouted at them, for whatever reason, was simply unacceptable and genuinely heartbreaking. I understand how the director and the production crew were trying to display an extreme case of autism (if indeed he has Asperger's Syndrome), but movies just don't work this way. I have had absolutely no emotional attachment to the characters throughout the movie, and I honestly didn't care whether Oskar completed his search and found the message behind.The plot line regarding the search was awfully ridiculous, too. Where did the Sixth Borough eventually go? There was no resolution. I was confused to the point I almost felt cheated. The whole talk regarding it made the whole movie seem even more unrealistic.The pace of the story was slow and in overall it was incredibly boring. It was a waste of having Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock – both incredible actors giving extraordinary performances – in a movie with an average script and storyline. The linkage to 9/11 was far-fetched and unbelievable. If the movie was actually trying to deliver some kind of deep meaning about the tragedy on ""the worst day"", I definitely did not receive it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
306,jeremydamaske,great adaptation to a beautiful story,9,2 January 2012,"After finishing the book a little over a month ago I was very excited to see that a film was being made and would be here for the new year. I got to see this film this past weekend on a trip to NYC for the holiday. It felt pretty incredible to get to experience viewing this movie blocks away from where it was filmed and where the original story took place. This may make my opinion seem biased. I thought that this film was a great adaption to Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. Thomas Horn does an excellent job representing Oskar and all of his maniacally sensitive and intellectually curious behavioral trademarks. A lot of folks seem to be super upset that Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock were casted as main roles of this film. both in my opinion were good performances that held very small parts in the film. Even John Candy, an incredibly well established actor, chose to take a part as insignificant as Stan the doorman. Max Von Sydow was nothing short of perfect. The film did add some things to make the story flow in a more cohesive manor. I feel that this was necessary because it would not be possible to replicate Foer's writing style to film. The film also did cut a lot of very beautiful and important parts out from Foer's story due to what I'm sure was a mere lack of time that Stephen Daldry had to tell this story. This movie in no way plays itself as a 911 tribute movie. Those who think that are completely missing the point of the story and its beauty. I would highly recommend seeing the movie but as well reading the original story.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
307,danitramarie,Amazing,10,5 January 2012,"""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" being made into a film? Unbelievable! Not only is this book on my top-favorite list, it also is the most well written novel I have on my shelf. Jonathon Safran Foer, in my opinion, is an abstract author. I can tell you right now that the film will not be as amazing as the novel, but after seeing the trailer, I am so damn excited. Films can never capture everything a book has, but it will be interesting to see what the director has done with all of the different perspectives involved in the novel. The novel has so many good one-liners that I hope the director has incorporated into the movie. It's fun and also heart breaking. I realize that there are people who are upset that this story is somewhat about 9/11, but it has more depth than that, if you would just give it a chance. ""The story is simple: about a boy whose father died in 9/11 and a couple of years after, he found a mysterious key under a flower vase inside his father's dresser.

As a parent of a child with an autism-spectrum disorder, I found the portrayal of Oskar, if very different from my own child, utterly believable.Oskar's attempt to make sense of an event that in the end makes no sense was heart-wrenching, but for me, the movie's most effective aspects where not merely the Oskar's journey, but those brief glimpses of both his mother's grief and all of those he touches on that journey.I think that a lot of people will find the protagonist difficult. Many attempts of those around him to comfort are utterly lost on him, and his inability to detect the emotional states in others along with his monomaniacal focus on attempting to process his father's death can make him profoundly unlikable for those not familiar with autism (or who don't care). Certainly, this is borne out in other reviews.In the end, this film touched me more deeply than most I have seen this year - 9/10.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

319,mickiegerie1977,Powerful and human!!! truly worth deserving best picture nomination!!!,10,24 January 2012,"Powerful and human!!! and it is NOT about 911 itself, it is the story of a child trying to make sense of his loss, and of those that are in his life.I am surprised with the myopia of some high critics, who complaint about how obnoxious the kid is.. they are missing the point totally!!!!First, let me me explain: The title is related to the high perception to stimulus kids with developmental disorders have. The acting is superb, Horn delivers a realistic performance of a kid with high functioning Asperger's disease. Bright, precocious but socially awkward and unable to understand his pain and process his feelings, in this case grieving in a ""normal way"". You see the world through his eyes, the way his brain is trying to make sense of the loss and pain. You can see his anguish and suffering even though he cannot really understand it.There is a heartbreaking scene when he tell his mother he wants to be normal and he promises her he will one day be normal. He understand there is something off .The stories and the acting are marvelous, understanding the pain of a broken marriage in the eyes of viola Davis in less than a 1 minute, the horrors of the WWII in the mute world of the renter. The need to come to terms with father-son relationships that we humans dream to have but sometimes we need to let go those dreams and accept reality, that such bond was never created. Above all the pain that goes behind closed doors of those that loss a family member on that ""worst day"" , as seen in the acting by Bullocks. In regards to the details of the movie to visuals, and sounds.. it really take you closer to how this kid perceives the world. The novel has many stories, including the grandparents story, but the movie is focused on Oskar and his emotional burden, as well as his journey. MAgnificent acting by Von Sydow! no a single word, but a wold of expressions and emotions. The relationship that develops between oskar and the renter is somehow a way of redeeming his past. Everyone in the theater was silent, and you could hear their tears, -along with mine.. it really touches your heart if you open your mind.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
320,bdyats,Brilliant Performances Make Their Mark,10,27 January 2012,"This movie features a new to Hollywood actor (Thomas Horn) in his first movie playing a very difficult part. In the movie, Oskar (Horn) states that tests for Asperger's Syndrome were inconclusive. If you don't know, Asperger's is a type of high-functioning autism. After watching the movie, I'm completely convinced that Oskar is definitely Asperger's. I'm sure this is very difficult to portray as an actor. As an Asperger's myself, I found numerous comparisons between myself and the Oskar. As a first time actor, I'm astounded by how spot-on Horn's portrayal of Oskar is. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock perform brilliantly in limited roles and Max von Sydow performs well for never speaking a word. From beginning to end, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close will keep you guessing and tell a story unlike any ever shown on screen.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Since I had very little interest in that movie i picked this one. To tell the truth, i went in there expecting that it was going to be sad and emotional, but not that emotional. Yeah i almost cried in some parts but at the time I wasn't in there to watch something so morbidly depressing. I enjoyed the characters and how they acted everything. It was a good plot line and everything was good. I'm just stating this as my opinion. I'm a teenager and depressing wasn't something i was looking for. So if you're in the mood for depression have at that movie all you want, otherwise go see something like Underworld because that movie just wasn't for me.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The premise was pretty out there and the movie was slow as molasses. We almost got up to leave twice in the first half hour. I don't think this is a spoiler because it mentions it in the synopsis of the story - It's hard to believe a 9 yr old child with Asberger's would be allowed by his loving mother (grieving or not) to wander the 5 buroughs of New York unaccompanied. Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate it. It was way too artsy for me.

I mean anything of substance, anything that matters. I kept waiting for the ""pieces"" of the movie to fall together, to make sense. Instead I found random pieces of a movie, that did not connect (at least in any way that mattered). I wanted a heart felt movie, or a somehow moving story line. I received none of this. I am familiar with autism, and this boy had no signs of autism. Autistic children have a hard time with eye contact, interacting with others, being touched, this boy had no problem interacting, making eye contact or being touched. In all my years of movie going I have never felt so disappointed, I actually sat in my chair and ""boo"" the movie at the end. I couldn't believe it was over without ever coming together. 3 out of 4 of my siblings walked out saying ""What just happened?"", ""Does anyone else get it?"" My one sister said it was odd but she liked it,the rest of us just felt very disappointed!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
324,saki-davis,"Beautifully directed, beautifully written",10,3 February 2012,"This movie was almost better than the book, which is hard to say for most adaptations. I was in awe of the creativity that was used in order to stir up our emotions the way Jonathan Safran Foer did with his writing skills.It is a real shame that people are complaining 9/11 is being used as a catalyst to provoke our emotions. My mom worked across frome the trade centers and lost a close friend, and she was so depressed she could not even visit ground zero a year later. But she loved this film. She didn't feel like it was emotionally insulting at all.Rather than the story profiting off the emotions surrounding 9/11, I think it is quite the opposite. The fictional story is a catalyst to help people come to terms with what happened. If you are so appalled at the use of fiction to create emotion, then you really don't understand what fiction writers are all about. Try reading Foer's books and tell me it doesn't touch you on more than just a superficial level. I've been a crazy fan of Foer because he affected my life when I read his books. We have to learn to distinguish between true literature/drama and pure entertainment. Fiction is not just entertainment. This movie was not just entertainment.The fact that some people are appalled at the child's behavior only shows how much of a lack of understanding they have of real human nature. The emotions expressed in this film/book are so raw, that apparently some audiences can not handle it. Maybe they're just used to seeing the fake crap that's spewed out to them on chick flick and prime time television.If you are an avid reader of Jonathan Safran Foer, you won't be disappointed by this film. And if you are thinking of watching this because you saw the trailers, don't let some pathetic excuses of bad reviews keep you from watching.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

327,shoffman419,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close to Good,7,7 February 2012,"This movie was on the verge of something great. To people criticizing its use of 9/11 just to evoke emotion: the focus of this movie is not the tragedy that happened, but how a young, autistic child copes with the loss of his father. Could the story have revolved around a different tragedy, such as losing his father in car crash or to disease? Sure, but that's been done. The reason this movie uses a global tragedy is because it's beyond what a child can understand and cope with (I myself was also in middle school when 9/11 happened, and didn't truly understand what happened until years later). I think this movie was close to something great. Sure, it was gimmicky at times, especially with the voice messages that Oskar listens to of his father, slowly revealing them to the audience one by one until its eventual climax with the final message. I think this is the greatest weakness of all in the movie, not the inclusion of 9/11.The characters are compelling, especially Oskar, even if he is obnoxious and frustrating at times: Thomas Horn nails his role. Children with autism (or Asperger's for that matter) have an extremely difficult time expressing emotion, so imagine having to deal with the loss of their father in a global tragedy that they can't possibly comprehend? I think the portrayal is remarkable, especially for such a young actor. So, bottom line, does it accomplish what it set out to do (or at least what I said earlier that I think it attempted to do)? Certainly. Could it have been better? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Definitely.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

In less the ten min, the director found a cure to Asperger's Syndome as Oskar do not need to wear his mask anymore??!! - Lack of developed characters, full of caricatures, unnecessary use of the 9/11 event - Not saved by Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock or Max von Sydow who have some rare moments of good acting.It's unbelievable that this movie received a Best Picture nomination....painful and long to watch...quickly forgotten the key is if after 2h10min, you are not able to recall any emotions or good feeling or lively moments of a movie, forget it! it is probably a big s**** :)",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
329,Otisburgh,Extremely Bad and Incredibly Annoying,1,14 February 2012,"I love watching movies, even bad ones I can laugh about later. I will never laugh about this one. I have never wanted to leave the movie theatre in the middle of a movie as much as I did with this one.The worst part is this movie is not forgettable like a lot of other useless films - I will never forget how bad this movie is.It wasn't the acting that made this bad, it was everything else. I did not feel for any of these characters - perhaps because it was so obviously contrived, basically the audience was told how to feel with the mood that was set. I could tell exactly how they were trying to make us feel, but instead of shedding a tear or getting even close to choked up, I felt angry. We were supposed to feel for this kid (Oskar), but I would have felt better if he got hit by a bus while he is wandering around New York on his own. His character was not likable at all - he was rude and weird, and not in a good way.This movie would have been better if it was a kids movie about a ""kid detective"" searching for clues on a city adventure. Instead they took this same theme and added a 911 back-story as an excuse to attempt a ""deep"" and ""painful"" message. Shame on them.Icing on the cake - nominated for best picture. Seriously? Apparently these voters do not have a mind of their own to decide how to ""feel"". Cue the melodramatic music, add a long camera shot of nothing to get that ""indie think piece"" feel, then base the drama around 911 and you got yourself a Oscar nod. What a shame.The funny thing is, I don't want to be alone in having gone through this terrible viewing experience, I have asked others to see it just so I have someone else to discuss with how extremely bad and incredibly annoying this movie really is. So I do recommend everyone see this movie - just don't pay.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
330,xxrachelxx25,An excellent and moving portrayal of a child making sense of something that makes no sense,10,18 February 2012,"This is my first review I have done, I actually created and account especially for this as I am quite shocked by some of the things I have read on here. I know that if you are reading this review you will have probably read other reviews and already know the story line by now, so instead of being tedious I will be giving my own personal views about what I thought were the main aspects of the film.Although I am not American, I still understand how much of a tragedy September 11th was, although I was only 7 years old at the time I remember coming home from school and crying in front of the TV watching the news. I know a lot of people have been criticising the film for exploiting September 11th just to emote the audience, but i do not think this is the case, although I have never experienced a loss as tragic as this I believe Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close is a very tasteful film which tells a beautiful and heart wrenching story of a child who has difficulty understanding and accepting the loss of his father.I also do understand that a lot of people who do go to watch the film will have never met anyone, adult or child, with autism, and may not be able to understand Oskar' behaviour. I will not insult these people by calling them ignorant, but I think anyone watching should be able to see that the child does have social and behaviour difficulties and should sympathise with his character more. When i went to watch the film last night I hadn't read any reviews and didn't know that Oskar had autism, but I have a nephew who is autistic and I noticed the signs right away and realised that so does Oskar and was able to relate to his behaviour and attitude and I couldn't help but see the similarities to my own nephew and this made me quite emotional and connect to Oskar very easily. As i was walking out of the cinema i actually turned to my boyfriend, and said I should have realised from the film title itself. Thomas Horn did an excellent job, I was very surprised to learn that this was his first movie and believe that he will have a very long and successful acting career and I can't wait to see him acting again, hopefully not in the too distant future.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

It only made me think. When I watched the trailer, yes I did notice how the movie is about 9/11 someway. This didn't really change the movie a lot for me. I don't think the movie is meant to be used "" as a gimmick ,or to make people cry "" This might be because I was very young at the time when it happened and wasn't involved. And i think any other way of his father dying would have been just fine. I just like how the movie is. Oskar, is an odd character.. But he I noticed upfront that he probably a little autistic, or something. I don't understand how so many people are saying "" he is awful, and over doing it."" No.. I think the way his character is makes the movie better. I guess people would rather a more ""normal"" kid would have played Oskar. And that it's plot didn't involve 9/11. This is still a story about a boy who is dealing with his fathers death. Everyone has their own way of dealing with death. BUT this movie does have a underlying theme, which is that when your searching for something, sometimes even if you don't find exactly what you are looking for, you still learned something. Because everything Oskar did, turned into a long story of meeting people, like his grandfather. All in all I would give it maybe 7 of 10 .

In the movie there is a mention of Oskar possibly having Asperger's Syndrome and based on my life as an Aspie and having two Aspie sons, I'm PRETTY SURE that Oskar is an Aspie - so many hallmark elements to this statement. The plot was deep, with meaning and substance. The acting was great and this young man, who never acted prior to this movie, did a stupendous job.

338,sos-cute-girl,Absolutely astonishing!,9,12 March 2012,"At some moments in the movie I couldn't even hold back my tears. This is really an amazing movie. Thomas Horn did an amazing part on playing Oskar as well as Sandra Bullock played his mother. Unlike others I won't judge Tom Hanks, he did a fine job and he had a tiny role in this movie(as for acting).Thomas' role was the most amazing role I've seen in many years. As an Audiovisual student, I got to say he might become a very great actor and has a bright future in front of him. Even though it's said Oskar doesn't have ""Asperger"" Syndrome(as far as I understood), he definitely has Autism, I have some experience in real life and I already noticed it in the trailer. Oskar is highly intelligent but social contacts and pressure/stress/loud sounds scare him until he's in a total shock. That's what remarks an autistic person, doesn't matter which part of the spectrum he has. Most autistic children have these problems and Thomas portrays that so well!As for the sound/editing/set-dressing/costumes: I liked how the voice over and all the sounds were mixed together. There was quite much voice-over, sometimes a bit too much, but that's a style choice. And still, it fits Oskar's character. The editing fitted every part of Oskar's situation, especially on the chaos parts. The costumes really told a bit about the character, especially on Oskar. His outfit fitted the character's personality: diverse,curious and colorful. The set-dressing was well done as well, I loved Oskar's room and the little space above his bed he made for his father. Also, the electronics used matched the electronics back in 2001.About people finding this insulting to 9/11 victim families: Gosh people, when are you going to live in the future? Those people died in 2001 and nobody's ever being able to see them back. That's what this movie is also about: accepting the facts even when it hurts so much! I don't live in the US, but I felt sympathy for every one of those relatives, friends and family members of every one of the 9/11 victims, even when I only recently started to feel those(I was 8 when those towers collapsed and those planes crashed, so I only recalled the news but never really knew what happened until I was older). And about getting out of the building .. what the ..! He was on the 100th floor if I remember well and can you walk down that many stairs? Since you may NOT use the elevator when there's a fire in the building(and there's a good reason for that! What if the elevator was on fire as well? Then the fire would spread much faster). If he was much more down in the building(let's say the 30th floor) he could've made it .. maybe. You'll never know. At moments like that you can't think and if you know you don't stand a chance you call the ones you love. Don't act like you wouldn't have done the same.Quite good start for the last month of the first movie trimester of 2012! And as for Thomas, I'm curious about your next works. Sandra, I think you can definitely grow into mother roles, since you're already doing so well.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I loved Tom Hank's small role in this movie. Instilling knowledge and the love of learning on his son and teaching him to overcome his fears even from beyond the grave.

If you know nothing about Asperger syndrome, this is a great way for you to glean a very truthful view of life with Asperger syndrome! At our local Cinema (The Electric Palace Cinema in Harwich) we had an audience of 100 school children - who spontaneously applauded at the end of the film. Although it's a long film they watched avidly, laughed with relief at the funny scenes - and there were quite a few, breaking the serious note and message of the film. As a parent of two teenage children I loved the relationship between the lad and his family. Without giving too much away, the end was surprising and such a relief! As a lone parent I understand that children miss what they have lost more than they appreciate what they have. I love the logic and seeing just how another individuals logic works. The characters were all very sensitively portrayed (warts and all), the 'boy' was fantastic - what a challenging role to get his head round at his young age! This film captivated the children and adults alike - beautiful photography and lovely insights into relationships and snap shots of life. My opinion is...ignore bad reviews and watch this film yourself. My son and I had a really good discussion about the film and what it meant to him... all positive I might add. I really wondered about the suitability of the topic for a group of school children and was so pleased that they chose to watch this film.

I found myself identifying with the protagonist in so many ways. He's what society would deem odd. But, at his core he is no different that any human being. I thank the writers for bringing this type of individual to the big screen. The acting is great. The director hits the right tones. And I must praise Thomas Horn. He perfectly captured the emotional turmoil that, not just an individual on the autism spectrum would feel at the loss of someone central to who they are, but what anyone would feel when faced with tragedy.

I have lost many, in my life, and a couple weeks before I watched this movie, my cousin had passed away and I have been struggling with grieving since I was 11 the first death I experienced was watching my father die. I still have not grieved and I am 33. That I believe is what this movie was trying show, not trying to use 9/11 as a gimmick to ""push buttons"" wow. It was to me beautiful and it showed humans, and human emotion and a glimpse at maybe what the families experienced as they lost on that tragic day, and that we are all human, we all have lost and we all grieve no matter what disorders we may have, which by the way was amazingly betrayed I might add. The recreation of the ""worst day ever"" was amazingly done with not too much attention on what was happening with the towers but what us, the humans were doing and what was going on all around. I understand that it must be difficult for those who had lost anybody on that day, whom I pray for every day, because I could not imagine what it would have been like, but those of us who sat in front of the television crying, praying, thanking god that we were so far this movie gave us a glimpse into that emotion,not just showed planes flying into towers.

It really cuts into you. I have never been outwardly emotional. I watched this movie alone which I shouldn't have done. I also watched this late at night and could not call anyone to help me through all the emotions I felt and tried to deal with. I cried most of the night.

What an incredible story to tell and, moreover, as a mother and educator, what a sensitive, insightful and poignant portrayal of a child with Asperger's Syndrome trying to make sense of the insensible. I will ever be grateful to the writer for this gift!!! As a mother who has raised a child with Asperger's Syndrome, it was so refreshing that the writer was able to look beyond the oddities if behavior and reach the depth of love and humanity in the main character. I hope all that view this film will have a better understanding and willingness to embrace those who don't fit a ""mold"".",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
346,sherrylevoy,Why all the negative reviews?,10,6 May 2012,"Once again Tom Hanks comes through as an incredible actor. I was surprised at the very small part Sandra plays and very surprised to find out who ""the renter"" is. The child was wonderful, a kid with years of experience couldn't have done it better. And all the negativity about 911 - get off it, it wasn't a ploy or meant to be a tearjerker, all movies have to have a basis. To say the child was ""annoying"", obviously a lot of people do not understand a child with any type of syndrome. This kid did an amazing job. You travel right along with the kid and keep your fingers crossed. Importantly the movie keeps you engrossed and interested. Wonderful movie.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
347,jenniewhistle,Thomas Horn deserved an award for this...,10,12 May 2012,"I loved this movie. I cried through many scenes. But I also cry through commercials, so that doesn't really say much about me! What I want to say about this movie, is that Thomas Horn deserved at least a ""nod"" for Best Actor in a role.Now - that may sound strange to say, considering it was his debut role - and he's just a child. So this leaves me with an obvious suggestion: Awards ceremonies need to have a special category for ""best child actor/actress in a role"" - because I cannot believe that George Clooney got Best Actor for the Descendants, and Thomas Horn wasn't even mentioned. It all comes down to fame. (I still think Clooney's award was for something different he's done - much like Goldberg won an award for Ghost because she was overlooked for the Color Purple - another debut role that transcended the norm.) What I can say, after having watched Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is that Thomas Horn should be expected to make headlines very soon. His acting was far more phenomenal than that of many experienced actors.Many condemn this movie because of the connection to 911, and the fact that it was focused on one boy, instead of focusing on the thousands of lives that were lost. I disagree with those criticisms.This movie is beautiful because it's personalized. It goes behind the scenes, to a personal space - and paints a picture of how a widowed parent is forced to suffer through the loss of a spouse, when there are children involved. In this case, the child has a disability - suggested to be aspergers, but never verified.I loved this movie and cried through most of it - not because I felt sad the entire time - but because the script was beautifully executed. Let's just say - I knew exactly where he was heading in the last scene - and the fact that I predicted it made my heart feel good - not cheated.Most who've read the book call it ""extremely loud and incredibly rude"" - but I would call it ""incredibly humble."" Movies never live up to books - but I feel this movie does a pretty good job (and I have read the book). I still recommend the book...but what transpires through the film shouldn't cloud ones judgement about how it ends. His character is less angry in the book - but the movie has less time to get the message across...Story aside - I posted this review to voice my opinion about Thomas Horn, to applaud him on a job that is so well done - I truly hope future awards will start recognizing talented children who exceed the talents of their experienced elders.This young man is geared for stardom.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
348,sajilsalim786,Do not waste 2 hours of your life,1,16 May 2012,"When watching a movie filed under the 'Drama' category, an absolute prerequisite is for the audience to feel endearment towards the main character(s), if that connection is not achieved then you end up with an extremely bored audience. This movie goes one step further, in the opposite direction, rather than endearment you feel the overwhelming ""want to get up and slap the little brat"" emotion.This movie attempts to pull at the heart string of the audience but it's all too ""hollywood"" with the usual, run of the mill, melodrama that becomes very transparent.I watched this film with my wife and we both hated it.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

I think every one who has lost someone and gone through the grieving process or knows someone that is going through it would find a place in their heart that understands what this movie is saying. Or if they have tried to find the courage to find themselves, they would get something good from this movie.The acting was very well done and the directing and editing of the film left nothing on the floor that should have been in it. The story of this boy and his quest was more than just finding the lock to the key. It was a part of how he dealt with his grief and came through the other side.The lessons he learned about people as well as himself and the chance at the end to get to share his grief with his mother are something that will stay with him for the rest of his life. All a part of his own odyssey of growing up and of dealing with the big truth.... he will never come back.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
350,powdered-eggs,A Challenging and Poignant Film,9,13 June 2012,"Some great plays of the past have a central character in them hallmarked by a single flaw. A flaw that defines their actions, their behavior, their choices. This film revolves around the scared heart of a little boy, crippled and blessed by his extraordinary intelligence. He's nine or ten, awkward around people, relying on tools he finds that would help him to cope with the painfully loud world he finds himself in. He's extremely rational, but given just a few false precepts - because he's a child, he doesn't know any better - this mindset is what launches the film along its journey. This is, at its heart, a story about a child trying to make sense out of unanswerable questions. He's violently intelligent, and at times there is some physical violence (no one gets hurt, but it's violent) at tense moments. It also tells the story of a mother crushed under the weight of the loss of her husband and forced to now learn her son whom discards her. There's more in it, but if you're not hooked by now you won't be.This movie will bore those not deeply empathetic to the aching of the human heart.It doesn't have a 'loud', bloom lighted, romantic music, feel-good ending, either. Which is not to say it's lacking an ending - it does, and fittingly so. Just like real life.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
351,woutervannes1,Read the book!,8,30 January 2015,"This film is pretty good, but it doesn't do the book any justice! The book by Safran Foer is so much more than what's displayed in the movie. I really can get in to people not liking the Oskar character and the movie really is but a summary of clips of the bigger story that the book tells. Nonetheless it tells the story for a big part and did that in a very nice way. I just suggests you read the book, it may totally destroy the movie for you but at least you get the entire story and the reading experience. There are so many literary and graphical elements in the book that make it so much more valuable than the movie, just because they can't, or didn't, translated that.

No one behaves the same, so don't understand how people can be so crucial of the lad's depiction of his character. I found it so moving. It is a watch again film. reminded me of The Straight Story, as he traveled around meeting new people and finding out their experiences while dealing with his own sorrows and thoughts. I love Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock which is why I chose the film in the first place, because I usually trust their choice of film to act in. I was not disappointed. I did weep from around midway of the film and continued until the end in empathy for anyone who may have had a loss in 9/11. or any other reason which the film did portray very well.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
353,antonytroughton,Emotionally charged,8,10 September 2012,"Great film. Took me 3-4 watch's to get through it, as it is IN YOUR FACE. A lot of people don't like that, and obviously Im in the same boat as well, hence the 3-4 viewings to finish the film. Truly emotionally charged, with a lot of loose ends (non-resolves), make this a very humane film, well done all. The reasons on my behalf for so many viewings is the content/subject matters are, intense. I still find 9/11 horrific, in the minute details, and while this is not a ""9/11"" film as such, it does deal with the tiny parts of normal grieving that we all go through when someone close pass's away. The childs behaviour is heavy as well, so a huge amount of respect goes out to the parents, families, social workers, that deal with this unique personality. However, if endured, this film offers hope through compasion and hardwork! Truly great film",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

His dialogue came off as contrived and his portrayal of Oskar seemed coached and disingenuous instead of endearing or believable... There were very few scenes where I didn't think to myself, ""Couldn't they have found a better child actor for this role?"" It was quite distracting and made the movie almost completely unwatchable.Thank goodness for Sandra Bullock and Max Von Sydow, as they are the only reasons I stuck it out and finished the film.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

It has got to be the worst film I have ever seen. There was no continuing story line. The child's character was ambiguous. Was he autistic or not? He was fixated with a mother that didn't even notice he was leaving the house at all hours of the night? There is willful suspension of disbelief and then there is this figment of a movie. I watched it twice on cable and the first time I thought I missed something, but I didn't. Predictable. The child character even more predictable. So glad I didn't waste actual money on this. Disappointment doesn't even sum it up.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
356,GreatArt1,Misconception about this movie,9,3 October 2012,"Guidelines recommend not commenting on other reviewers' reviews. However, a reviewer made an (incorrect) reference to the Jewishness of the characters of this movie (they were specifically NOT Jewish), and then proceeded to rant about the prominence of Jews in popular culture. I feel this warrants a response, especially since the characters in this movie are not even Jewish (the grandparents are German survivors of the 1945 bombing of Dresden clearly implying that they are non-Jews).I wrote a private communication to Glock22 who reviewed this movie. I feel it should be posted publicly as well to dispel a misconception about this movie that is probably not unique to Glock 22. Here it is:""Hi Glock22,I am compelled to respond to your review of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.The movie (and book) clearly state that the grandmother and grandfather are survivors of the bombing of Dresden in Germany. This was in February of 1945. The obvious implication of this is that they are Germans (non-Jewish) who survived the war and emigrated to the United States. There would be virtually no Jews left in Dresden, which is a major Germany city, by 1945. Schell is a very common German name.You refer to the Grandmother as a holocaust survivor, so unless you think of ALL survivors of the war in Europe on BOTH SIDES of the war as ""holocaust survivors"" (which I doubt), then you assumed that they were Jewish survivors as soon as you heard they were from Germany during the war.You then proceed to go on a rant about the prominence of Jews in movies and T.V., which is kind of pathetic since what made you bring up the topic at all was a false/incorrect understanding that the main characters in the movie were Jewish. They obviously were not. Nowhere in the movie does it refer to them as such. Quite the opposite, by referring to them as survivors of the Dresden bombing, it clearly implies that they were SPECIFICALLY NOT Jewish. I would feel differently about your review if their status as Jews or Non-Jews was ambiguous or left open, but that was not the case. The facts as presented makes it clear that this is a movie whose main characters are NON-JEWS.That fact makes your observation about the Israeli gas mask even funnier. Israel, for obvious reasons, is one of easiest places to obtain high quality gas masks, and the reference to an Israeli gas mask as a gift to an over-frightened boy who has lost his father in the 9/11 attack makes perfect sense. In any case, your connecting that reference to their Jewishness and the focus of the movie on Jewish characters, is even more absurd once you take into account the falseness of your original assumption.One has to wonder for ALL of your reviews whether or not you pay so little attention to what is actually going on in the movie you are reviewing. Clearly, once you have let the facts just slide by, you then let the lens through which you see everything take your interpretation of the rest of whatever you are reviewing into realms that make no sense unless you revise everything to conform with your original misunderstanding based on your not paying any attention to what is actually going on. It makes EVERYTHING you have to say suspect.""",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

358,Vanessajennings,Great Movie :),7,13 November 2012,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, was an inspiring and touching movie that taught me life lessons or how to live a good life. The movie was based on family, death, and determination, this was all caused by the 9/11 terrorist attack. For example, the film was inspiring and touching because the way you see how you can instantly loose a family member or someone important in life faster than you know and how it effects many lives. Thus, the motion picture was an amazing experience. Although, there were many scenes that made me very emotional. The Stephan Daldry movie starring Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell, who was the main character that went on a door to door journey to find what his key unlocked and could tell him more about his father. Oskar was a determined young man, that was very close to his father, whom he had lost in the 9/11 attack. He found a key that he thought would lead him closer to information about his father. Eventually, after planning, researching, skipping school, using every minute of weekends, making charts and maps, Oskar realized that the key lead someone else closer to their dead father but lead Oskar not even a tiny bit closer to his. Even though, Oskar didn't become closer to his deceased father he became closer to his grandfather, who he never knew existed before his adventure. Furthermore, the movie has inspired me as well as brought me closer to my family. This tragic event that destroyed many families has made me to be more thankful for mine. It was also an inspiration to me how Oskar had so much faith and determination to go out on his own knocking on unfamiliar doors. It taught me that if I want something bad enough and give my all, it can be worth it in the end. Seeing how you could lose a loved one at any time changes my outlook in life. If I hadn't watched this movie, I feel that I wouldn't be as close to my family and friends as I am today.On the contrary, the movie could have been seen as a horrible film due to the lack of action and the amount of prediction and imagination that was needed in the film. The film didn't have a lot of detail nor good descriptions. Therefore, if you look for a big amount of detail in a film I don't recommend this movie. If you expect a movie with a good quantity of computer graphics then this movie isn't for you. Moreover, the movie was emotional and brought excitement, curiosity, and sadness to me. Likewise, the film made me sad and brought many tears to my eyes because of many scenes. The first was watching how Oskar had many regrets by not answering his phone when his dad was calling him minutes before his death. Instead, he sat and listened to voice mail after voice mail his father left hearing him face his death in the last message. Secondly, I was very emotional watching how Oskar yelled at his mother wishing she would've died instead of his father. Finally, I was sad because after all the hard work Oskar did for his expedition, he did it all for nothing. Henceforth, the movie had me curious to see if he was going to pick up his fathers last call or why his mom allowed him the freedom to ride the subway by himself and go to strangers' houses. Last but not least, I couldn't wait as Oskar got closer and closer to finding what the key unlocked. Additionally, I was excited for Oskar knowing he was able to have a great life without his father being there. Even though, he was happy towards the end I was excited that he made up with his mom and that their relationship as a mother and a son had the chance to grow stronger. In conclusion, the movie was great. I recommend this movie to those who aren't very close to family and that need a good reason why they should be. Without our families we wouldn't be as great as a person we all are now. I challenge all readers of my review to watch the film and than tell me how it affected your life, if it did.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The movie is painfully long for something so sad so it loses a point perhaps for diluting the emotion with length. But this is a quibble. Beautifully acted and photographed. Stephen Daldry gets a wonderful, if occasionally shrill, performance from Thomas Horn but he wins you fully by the end. This is the a film almost impossible to make today without the power of a Scott Rudin behind it. 911 was a national and personal tragedy for Americans and people around the world but this film really personalizes it. It's themes of loss, grief and recovery are universal so there is something for everyone here. Thanks for making a real movie about family.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

The storyline, on the other hand was okay, it was planned out great but there could have been more visuals to it.

The movie put so much emotion towards 9/11 and the effect it put on family's.The movie was very emotional.....it made me cry in so many scenes. It had was full of sorrow in most scenes. The actors were doing everything amazingly and were what made this movie a tear-jerking experience. Being based on the tragic 9/11 moment that changed everyone in anyway. It was a passionate movie. Being such an emotional encounter, the movie changed the way I looked at life. Personally, it brought me closer to not only family but God as well. The movie had such a beautiful effect on me, it made me realize how lucky I am to have a mom and dad, to be more thankful about my life and the people in it.

361,rader91,Masterpiece that I will love for life,10,3 May 2018,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is one of the most remarkable films I have had the pleasure of seeing. It's about a boy, who has teenage emotions and an adult mentality, living with aspergers. That alone is an interesting character, but the film quickly begins taking us on a journey. It's a journey of searching for something that Oscar knows he may never find. If you have ever lost a loved one, you can relate with Oscar to some degree. But to see your dad falling to his death from the World Trade Center, just like every Manhattan child who lost a parent on 9/11, thinking that they see their mom or dad falling, you experience a heartbreak that only this film can capture. It is such a respectable tribute to ""the worst day"", September 11, 2001. For all of the bodies that burned into the rubble, their children will never stop searching until they fill a gap in their heart. That is exactly what the film is about. So if you were disappointed that you didn't get a Goonies pirateship full of treasure, don't watch a movie about 9/11. In fact, stay away from movies that are something different. Not everyone can handle a tragic, loving, and sophisticated story. Stick to reboots. I will watch this movie again and again. I enjoyed it more than the book. I'd also like to mention the actors did an amazing job, and the composer made the most beautiful soundtrack. If there is a chance that anyone who helped make this movie possible reads this, thank you from the bottom of my heart for making something so amazing, and for making my favorite movie.

It had some of the worst acting I have seen. The little boy did not act like anyone else I have ever met with Aspergers, and his portrayal of the scenes were completely different from how they were conveyed in the novel. He was so unlikeable it made it nearly impossible to watch the rest of the movie. Sandra Bullock and Tom Hank's roles were blown up to get them more screen time, versus the grandparents, who's sub- story made up 2/3 of the novel and were extremely downplayed in the movie.

364,mykidsmomx4,"Very emotional movie, but well done and great acting.",9,25 May 2013,"I knew what I was getting into with this movie since I'd recently read the book. When reading the book, my 13yo son noticed what I was reading and suggested I watch the movie, which he'd watched at school. First of all, I have never had such intense emotions, nor cried so much during a movie as I did with this one. I appreciate that the movie, while extremely emotional, switched back and forth between the emotional part and the other part of the storyline, which allowed me to recover a bit before plunging back into the tissue box. Of course any movie about 9/11 is certain to be emotional; this one, since it was told from the perspective of a precocious, sensitive boy, was not just a look at how 9/11 affected him and his family, but how he had to process things in his own way. It was a beautiful story about his very close relationship with his father and, as a result of losing his dad and setting out on a ""recognizance mission"", finding a relationship with his mother. They both found strength that they didn't know they possessed and, in doing so, realized that they still had each other and their memories of the man they loved and still love. It was more than a story about 9/11. It was about facing our fears and walking through them, emerging even stronger than we ever imagined we could be. It's about accepting change, even when it makes no sense and is not wanted or welcome. I would recommend this movie without hesitation, but be warned that it is not an easy one to get through. I was exhausted after the movie, but also felt renewed. It wasn't a ""feel good"" kind of movie, but I did feel good when reflecting on the story. It made quite an impression on me.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close

Despite the devastating reality of loss as seen from the eyes of a child who loses a parent in that event, this story is really not about tragedy. It is about the endless capacity of a mother's love. The performances by Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are inspired, but it is the performance of the young lead that captures viewers. The story itself is beautiful, but the cinematography is equally stunning. The real power of this is revealed in the way lives intersect and people are brought together by a tragedy that may or may not have touched them personally. Beautiful movie.

This is a movie I definitely don't regret watching and would absolutely suggest it to a friend without hesitation. It reminded me of why 9/11 is still such an important subject, even after many years. I will for sure look into reading the book.

Would thoroughly recommend anyone to watch this, as long as they can with an open mind to the characteristics of the child.

So why the heck after he found the key he kept looking at the blank solid key and didn't think of looking at the cover! He also put the key back in the cover, keeps asking his grandma and the guy at the keys shop"" Hey, I found that key in that cover, there's no clue about it's lock, not a one! do you know anything about it?"" if i were that man in the keys shop i would slap him in the face and telling him he's a blind before telling him about that ""Black"" word! that seemed very odd for me as he supposed to be a clever kid, -- The other thing that blowed my mind about his extremely cleverness.. He had that paper with ""notstop looking"" thing all over the movie! he had that paper even before his father dies, he kept that paper with him during his genius searching, he spent nights looking at this word which inspires him to keep looking. Because of this paper with the two words marked, he searched in a huge books about every single ""black"" person in new york, he made a schedule for them, he made a genius relationship between their names and numbers, He placed their places on a map, and made a genius plan to visit them all in about 2 years! what a genius kid! BUT, all this time, he NEVER looked at the back of that paper!, he spent nights looking at these words, he showed that paper to his grandpa, he kept that paper with him along the movie, he searched a bunch of books and names for any clue, but he NEVER turned the paper around! or even noticed that BIG RED MARK on the back!! I mean what the F*** guys!. Seriously!!! he supposed to be genius!, not as stupid as Shi*! That's why the movie called ""Incredibly close""? i think it should named Extremely genius and incredibly stupid, after that boy.

The 9/11 part is of course touching but it the movie as such is still extremely badly presented. The protagonist also acts and speaks as if he was 43 years old. No 11 year old speaks that way. The script writer must be tired of his job. And the same goes for the director - this film is so badly directed my cats could have done it better.

I have worked with children for years, including some on the autism spectrum and I thought his behavior was very authentic for a child of his age.Also, please have mercy and tell us what was in the safety deposit box. I can see how frustrating it must have been for him after spending the entire movie looking because it is also frustrating for my husband and I.I was very relieved to find out that his mother knew what he was doing, protected him, and paved the way for him with the people named Black.

371,noahcurcio,Differences and Commons with the novel,7,4 March 2016,"(There could be some spoilers! Attention!) Hello everybody. I saw the movie during our English class two days ago. I found the film very interesting, although the story was taken by a fictional book, which I read too, but I found distressed and strange. The film has lots of commons with the book, but also some differences. It can be mentioned that the part of the book which was really interesting was filmed, and the other ""boring"" or strange parts were taken out of the script (fortunately). So at the end you see a film which actually deals about a very interesting topic (9/11). The movie is well structured and has a good casting (Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and Max Von Sydow) which was not really necessary for this film, but okey...! So guys if you want to know more about the movie why you don't check out the wikipedia article or other blogs, or you just watch the film!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
372,roller_man,Inspiring story of a boy who never gives up.,9,17 September 2017,A breathtaking story remarkably recreated by the cast. The memorial day on 11th of September seen through the eyes of a kid. An unusual child who is trying to get to the mystery left by his father or maybe everything is in his imagination. One journey in the big city of New York which completely absorbs you and you wait for every next step of frantic interest.,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
373,biliwewe,Extremely Quiet and Incredibly Close,8,21 October 2018,"This is not a perfect film. What's truly remarkable is that I had already been submerged by all the negative comments about it before I clicked on the video. If you check this film on Rotten Tomatoes, you'll find an appallingly lower point than those films of its kind. And viewers on RT always seem friendlier. For a film which possesses such an amazing crew and a sound story, how repulsive and unacceptable the audience decided it to be is quite a wonder.Maybe it is due to the influence of those unpleasant opinions, this film seems, at first, indeed full of flaws. There are too many clues, and they are never summarized properly. The frequent jumps form the present to the past keeps you distant and distracted. Also, it is extremely loud. The boy's scream, anger and accusation make it nearly impossible for the audience to get close with this eccentric little creature, or the story.But it is when the boy's grandfather appears that the narrative suddenly turns calm, gentle, and even slightly sweet. It is also the time when I was finally aware of the fact that the boy is ill so it is reasonable that his behaviors differ from normal kids. As you begin to see the world from his perspective, you can easily understand his agony, his broken heart for the loss of his dear father, and his delicate kindness and care shown to others through a rather unique way. After the criticism is forgotten, the story gradually unveils its sincerity and variety, the catastrophe, a destructed family, a lost kid all growing clear.Tom Hanks shines in this film. Although he constantly does a fantastic job in almost all his roles, his performance in this heartfelt movie is still surprising. He plays a wonderful father who died at 9/11. Mr. Schell exists in this film only in his son's memory. Through those fragments, the audience can feel clearly his warmth and wit. He is without doubt the most amazing dad, leaving such a strong and supportive father figure that always lingers and motivates the story. He is also a loving husband, who tragically was deprived of the chance to express his numerous love and care to his beloved family at his last minutes.If there's a color to represent Mr. Schell, it is gold, not only for his special way of existence, but for his benign character, the way he treats his son, so equally interact with him yet quietly encouraging. All this will look further more beautiful if you consider how observant and patient he is to contrive to help his not-so-normal son develop and grow happily, healthily and freely.It is not a perfect film. What it has, is some outstanding performances delivered by some of the finest actors, a heartbreaking story which reveals part of the cruelty of the tragic event, a sorrowful protagonist who lives the trauma, and after experiencing the worst things, directs people to hope, uplifting human spirits, and a rosy future.As a person who is truly touched by it, I have only one suggestion for you. That is, you may have to be extremely quiet, and then you'll find that you and the story are actually, incredibly close.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
374,oliviarulesall,One of the most emotional movies I've ever seen,10,26 May 2020,"Everyone in the reviews who bashes on the main character (Oskar) for being annoying/rude/loud/etc. has clearly NEVER spent time with a non-neurotypical person, much less a child. Even though it's not explicitly stated, it is heavily implied that Oskar has Aspergers or is on the autism spectrum. This movie is emotional because this IS how real people act and speak. Oskar goes through the unimaginable trauma of losing his father (the only person he feels he can truly relate to) and after spending months hyperfixating on clues that could lead him to something about his father, he finds that his wild goose chase was really for someone else. OF COURSE he would be devastated, of course he would yell and scream and cry; if you find raw human emotion irritating and ""bratty"", you should really take a second to evaluate why you are unable to feel any empathy toward another human being. This movie was a rollercoaster of emotions, and it deserves every bit of acclaim it has received. Even though the ending isn't the ""happy"" one that we would expect, it shows the true growth of Oskar through his relationships with the people he meets along the way. Neurodivergent children often find it difficult to talk to new people and relate to them, something that Oskar's father was trying to help him work on during their adventures. Even after his father was gone, Oskar kept his father's memory alive by going on yet another adventure.In terms of the film's reference to 9/11, it shocks me that people would find this insensitive and ""exploitative"" of the tragic event. This film shows the reality that many children and families faced that day. If you can watch this film and not feel even an ounce of compassion for Oskar after everything he has to go through, please try to put yourself in another person's shoes for once.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
375,Robert-872,Perfect Portrayal of an Autistic Spectrum Disorder Child,10,20 January 2012,"I have read a LOT of reviews from people who seem to know absolutely nothing about children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders. Thomas Horn did an excellent job portraying one. He was very moving in everything he did! I know he did a great job because I have two children with the disorder and he fit perfectly between their two levels of autism. Does he have big beautiful eyes... sure. Don't knock the kid because he looks good. He was spot on with his acting! This story has you feeling all sorts of emotions and by the end of the movie we had all shed a lot of tears. And the tears were caused by what the child was doing to handle his grief and understand why his dad was taken away from him and NOT because it had anything to do with 9/11. My son had lost his mom and the movie brought back all sorts of emotions because he could relate to the child perfectly. This movie has replaced Billy Elliot on my list of most moving story. Not everyone can enjoy this kind of loving and sophisticated story so it might not be for everyone but if you have a heart and have ever lost a parent, I am sure that you will love this movie! Another moving story brought to us by Stephen Daldry!",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
376,whitx5,A haunting and lovely tale of a boys journey to keep his father alive in his memory.,10,28 January 2012,"I personally loved this movie, and was shocked to see such negative reviews. I loved the fact that it centered around 9/11, as I think as painful and emotional as that was, we should NEVER forget it. I thought that the acting was superb and the scenery of NYC was wonderful. I loved the message and even though I was emotionally exhausted by the films end, I still felt good after seeing it. I give this film 10 stars and hope to see it receive many awards. I'll be owning it on DVD when its released. The acting by the whole cast, although the boy carried the movie almost single handily, was great, and this movie seriously touched my heart.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
377,c-02204,Underestimated!,8,18 September 2018,"I am always easily be involved in a movie lead by kids.This one definately have the power to touch people, to talk to people. As we can see, the boy has some psychological problems, the special narrative way conveys the message and moreover, push the story particularly. This is a perspective from a young child, though not so perfect, enough for people to remember the day in another way.",Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
