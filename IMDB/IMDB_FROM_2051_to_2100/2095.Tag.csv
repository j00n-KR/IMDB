0,TheLittleSongbird,Catch me if you can,6,11 August 2018,"Loved the idea, based on a true story, the advertising was interesting and the cast is a talented one (Jeremy Renner, Isla Fisher and John Hamm particularly have shown themselves to be more than capable in a lot of things). 'Tag' had the potential right off the bat to be a fun and intriguing film, regardless of its mixed critical reception.'Tag' turned out to be just that, fun and intriguing with some over-the-top excitement and a few tender moments. It is far from perfect and it is not great or one of those unforgettable films of the ages films, with content that is not going to be for all tastes, but it did make me smile and laugh and a lot of effort went into it. Neither one of the best films of the year or the worst, instead it's somewhere in the middle which is not too bad a position to be in.It looks good, slick, stylish and sometimes clever, never incoherent. The music appeals on the ear and is hardly ill fitting. The direction shows an ease with the material and allows the cast and their chemistry to shine. Much of 'Tag' goes at a lively pace and the cast are stellar mostly, Jeremy Renner and Isla Fisher being particularly good.A good deal of the film is very funny and often hilarious. Am actually not always a fan of lowbrow comedy, am more a sophisticated, witty and subtle (and also dark and screwball) sort of person myself, but there are times where it's done well thanks to the wit, the sharp timing and the comic timing of the cast and 'Tag' is one of those examples. A few touching tender moments too and it makes the game of tag interesting and exciting.However, 'Tag' is not perfect. The flimsiness of the story does show in moments of slack pacing in some extraneous scenes (namely the dramatic ones). The film sometimes goes overboard on the sentimentality, the tacked on (or that's how it felt) ending, as well as the over-the-topness.While most of the cast are fine, Leslie Bibb's overacting does get too much quite badly that it gets tiresome. Didn't see the need for Jake Johnson's character when nothing is done with him, merely an example of a just there stereotype. Do agree that some of the content is distasteful, am not surprised actually at the offense the miscarriage jokes/parts have garnered (can be known to find things found controversial blown out of proportion in film, not this time with it being one of the worst things one can go through).Summing up, an uneven film but an enjoyable one. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Tag
1,SnoopyStyle,likeable group of friends,6,23 August 2018,"Wall Street Journal reporter Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis) is interviewing businessman Bob Callahan (Jon Hamm) when they're interrupted by Hoagie Malloy (Ed Helms) in disguise. The guys explain that they've been playing the same game of tag since childhood in the month of May. Rebecca is immediately more interested in the tag story and joins them as they set out to tag the untagable Jerry Pierce (Jeremy Renner) who has never been tagged in 30 years. Jerry is marrying Susan Rollins (Leslie Bibb) and the group heads home to crash the party. The group includes Chilli Cilliano (Jake Johnson), Hoagie's wife Anna (Isla Fisher), and Kevin Sable (Hannibal Buress). Jerry invites Bob and Hoagie's childhood love Cheryl Deakins (Rashida Jones) to distract them.I really like this group of actors and they have a fun chemistry together. This is fun for awhile but the stakes are so low that it fails to gather any tension. The momentum fades and I'm not sure how to get it back. The heart of this movie is the group dynamics. From the first moment of Helms and Hamm, I'm in on this group. I'm less convinced about Wallis. She's a little bland and if she's that way, then she has to be a romantic interest for somebody. Fisher has a couple of funny outbursts as she is known to do. Renner is almost playing the villain which may be too dark for this light inconsequential subject matter. Rashida Jones comes in later but the love triangle wilts on the vine. The first tag scene with Renner has a fun action thrill but the subsequent ones doesn't have the same punch. Overall, this is a fun bunch but the fun in the movie does fade.",Tag

3,nogodnomasters,This is getting way too extreme.,6,10 July 2018,"A group of adults have a contiguous game of tag that goes back thirty years. They only play during the month of May. Hogan (Ed Helms) is determined to tag Jerry (Jeremy Renner), a fast resourceful guy who has never been tagged. He rounds up the gang as they head toward his May wedding. The characters were good. I liked how the women got into helping their husbands, although Annabelle Wallis was under utilized in her role. I didn't like Jeremy Renner as Jerry, I thought Rob Riggle would have been better and maybe James Franco instead of Jake Johnson. The film spoofed action choreography. A globe trotting sequel would be great. Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.",Tag
4,kosmasp,Boys will be boys ...,9,27 October 2018,"The incredible thing here? That this is actually based on a true story. I mean at the end you get to see the real life persons behind the characters. And yes the movie enhances things and takes liberty to tell a story. But still having adults doing this all their life and be so close to each other should warm your heart (if you have one that is - just kidding).So if you like some meat behind your comedy, this should be your thing. It gets low at times (joke-wise) and it has some cringe worthy depictions of things. But if you can over that, you will realize the drive behind it. Friendship, holding on to fantasy and childhood. As some may already understood, this can be seen as a bad thing too (for the adults that is) - but that will be in the eyes of the beholder. In this case the movie really can win you over and it was made with a lot of heart - can't stress that enough",Tag
5,classicsoncall,"""Our friend is a psycopath, and this is scary!""",7,7 September 2019,"I usually don't go for these low brow films but the concept sounded intriguing and I like a few of the actors appearing in the story so I gave it a try. It actually was pretty funny in parts, and the individual players performed their roles well as former childhood buddies who grew up, but never gave up their overzealous passion for playing 'tag'. In that regard, Ed Helms was the most over-the-top portraying his character Hogan 'Hoagie' Malloy, closely matched by his story wife, Isla Fisher as Anna Molloy. Together they pull out all the stops to tag the untaggable Jerry Pierce (Jeremy Renner), who for thirty years reigned as the uncrowned champion of a game in which he couldn't be touched. Quite honestly, I thought Hoagie's hospitalization following Jerry's wedding was yet another elaborate set up to deliver the impossible tag, but the writers held back and came up with an inspired and effective dialog that spoke to the long held friendship that kept the guys together for so many years. There's nothing here worthy of any kind of award nomination, but the fast and funny antics will leave you amused long enough to tag along.",Tag
6,jboothmillard,Tag,4,14 July 2018,"I knew it was about the playground game ""Tag! You're It!"", then I read it a based on the Wall Street Journal article entitled ""It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being It"" by), so it really is based on a true story, I hoped it would be reasonable fun. Basically Hogan ""Hoagie"" Malloy (Ed Helms), Bob Callahan (Jon Hamm), Randy ""Chilli"" Cilliano (Jake Johnson), Kevin Sable (Hannibal Buress) and Jerry Pierce (Jeremy Renner) have been best friends since 1983. They have managed to keep in touch by playing the game of ""Tag"" annually, during the month of May, with Jerry being the only player who has never been tagged ""It"". Hoagie recruits Bob, Chilli and Kevin for one last attempt to tag Jerry, telling them that Jerry plans to retire after this year's game because of his upcoming marriage. Wall Street Journal journalist Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis) is doing a piece on Bob, she decides to join them and write an article about them, finding their story fascinating, they are also accompanied by Hoagie's wife Anna (Isla Fisher). Once in their hometown, they locate Jerry and make an attempt to tag him but are overwhelmed by his skills of escape. Jerry introduces his fiancée Susan Rollins (Leslie Bibb), Jerry explains they were not invited to the wedding, because knew he would almost certainly be tagged or targeted during the ceremonies. They agree to not play the game at any wedding-related events in exchange for invitations to the wedding. Despite this, the group makes several attempts to tag Jerry, but constantly fail, including one attempt leaving Hoagie, Chilli, and Kevin in painful traps, set by Jerry. During the rehearsal dinner, Susan reveals to the guys that she is pregnant, the group feel defeated and try to build a new plan. They find out that Jerry attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, so decide to strike at his next meeting, on the same day as his wedding, in preparation, they lock and barricade every door. They make their move to tag Jerry, trapped inside the church he retreats to the wine storage, he stays there for hours while the others sit outside. Susan comes by, the wedding is just hours away, she berates Jerry for the childish game playing, then she appears to be having a miscarriage. Jerry comes out to help her, Chilli is convinced that it is a ruse, but the situation seems authentic, and Jerry himself also tells them he is not playing around and the two leave. The guys receive text messages that the wedding has been postponed due to the potential miscarriage, but a suspicious Anna manages to get the truth from one of the bridesmaids, the wedding is still on schedule. Incensed by the trick, the gang decide to crash the wedding, upon their arrival, Susan confirms that both the miscarriage and pregnancy were fake. Angry at Jerry's lying, after the vows and as the newly married couple kiss, Hoagie charges at Jerry to tag him, only to take the pastor to the ground. Hoagie loses consciousness, Jerry thinks this is a ruse, but Anna confirms he has a serious condition and calls an ambulance. Everyone gathers in the hospital to see Hoagie, he tells the truth: he lied about Jerry quitting after the season to reunite his friends after discovering he has a tumour on his liver and advanced liver cancer, he may not be alive the following year. Jerry chooses to swallow his pride and allows Hoagie to tag him, the group starts the game again, changing the rules during so that Anna and Rebecca can play as well, and they all run around the hospital tagging each other as they did as children. Before the end credits, archive footage and photographs show the real group of ten men that inspired the film, who have been playing Tag for 28 years, and continue their game to this day. Also starring Angie Tribeca's Rashida Jones as Cheryl Deakins and Brian Dennehy as Mr. Cilliano. Helms and Hamm are the most childishly competitive, Renner is amusing spoofing his previous superhero persona to avoid tagging, Buress is deadpan, and Fisher is wild as the maniacal cheerleading wife. It is good it is based on a real story with an underlying message about friendship, some of the over-the-top slapstick, including in slow-motion, did make me laugh, but it lapse a little at times, it gets very outlandish, and the fake miscarriage does push the boundaries of bad taste, but it's not all bad, a reasonable comedy. Okay!",Tag
7,oscaralbert,"From Presidential ""Checkers"" speeches to silly ""Trump"" cards . . .",7,20 June 2018,". . . the always eponymous Warner Bros. have issued TAG as a warning that America's so-called government has devolved to the level of the most rudimentary kiddies' game. ""Based upon a true story,"" TAG could be ripped from Today's headlines with its cast of health insurance billionaires and star national media journalists. Though all of this may sound like ""fun and games"" to some, TAG's sobering ending conveys Warner's bottom-line caution that our current state of affairs is as serious as a liver tumor. Not content to rest upon their well-deserved laurels, Warner already has ear-marked much of its anticipated merger windfall toward their next entry of the TAG Franchise, slated to start production within a few weeks. Based upon another Real Life Saga already partially documented by U.S. Attorneys, the FBI, and Special Counsels, Warner plans to fill in the gaps and connect all the dots with its upcoming Holiday release, I SEE SOMETHING RED.",Tag
8,neil-476,Hugely likeable,8,9 July 2018,"5 men devote every May to playing Tag, something which they have been doing since they were kids. 30 year ago. And Jerry has never been tagged, and time is running out.This is a great idea, but very very silly. Until you find out that it is based on the activity of a group of 10 real-life friends. Ed Helms' air of an everyman teetering on the edge is ideal for the role of Hoagie, pushing hard for the group to tag Jerry, and Jeremy Renner has huge fun as Jerry, supremely self-confident because he is, in fact, far better at this than the other 4 combined.There are some action set pieces which are very well choreographed as well as being funny, and some fun performances, not least from Isla Fisher as Hoagie's wife, ever-so-slightly out of control. The story takes an unexpected twist towards the end, but it works,And, importantly, I liked these people. Hoagie is a bit of an ass, and Jerry is a bit full of himself, but on the whole these are decent, likeable folk and I enjoyed their company.The end credits contain a selection of home movie clips featuring the real-life taggers in action over the years.

9,morrison-dylan-fan,Tick.,7,8 December 2018,"With Christmas coming up,I started looking for a Comedy flick that a friend would enjoy watching over the holidays. Hearing her praise the excellent Game Night, (which I've also reviewed) I looked for similar titles, and found one which led to me tagging into the game.View on the film:Chasing after the guys (and the women) playing the game, director Jeff Tomsic & cinematographer Larry Blanford give the set pieces an Action-Comedy crunch, via darting fast zoom-ins as a hand reaches out to tag, and shots of slo-mo tracking the most stealth methods of avoiding the tag.Making his cinema debut after years making TV movies and series, Tomsic displays a keen grip on keeping the atmosphere snappy, with side screen wipe keeping the game in constant ""action"" mode, and wide group-shots catching the taken aback glances as each member makes plans on how to tag Pierce.Tagged from Russell Adams WSJ article entitled ""It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being It"" (!) the screenplay by Rob McKittrick and Mark Steilen plays bromance-style bonding with slick physical comedy. Whilst jokes where the guys are at various times called gay feel ill-fitting, the writers make up for it with dollops of charm from the increasingly hilarious, over the top ways the loyal friends try to outplay Pierce.Setting up in flashbacks over years that Pierce has never been beaten, the writers do really well at building a bond Callahan and the others in the group over never having got this win, whilst Pierce is visible more detached to his friends due to the game.Having the eye of a hawk to spot all tag attempts,Jeremy Renner gives a great turn as Pierce, whose dead-pan manner from Renner has Pierce escaping under the nose of his pals. Reuniting with Renner from The Town (2010) Jon Hamm gives a very funny, frustrated turn as Callahan, whilst Ed Helms and Lil Rel Howery as Malloy and Reggie hand out the slap-stick with zest in ths epic round of Tick.",Tag
10,deloudelouvain,Funny relaxing movie with a dumb story.,7,9 September 2020,"I agree that the story of Tag is quite dumb, growing men playing tag is just dumb, but I can't deny I had a lot of fun watching this movie. Ed Helms has one of those nerdy funny faces that makes me laugh all the time, but I get it that not everyone can be a fan. The rest of the cast was also good, even though I'm not a big fan of Hannibal Buress, not as a stand-up comedian nor as an actor. But other than that I liked everything about this movie, even the stupid infantile story (that is even better when you're baked). If you're easily pleased, with a good sense of humor you'll like Tag. On the other hand if you're searching for a story with some depth, or if you lack of a funny bone, you should just skip this one.",Tag
11,Hellmant,"No soon-to-be-classic (like it feels like it really wants to be), but worth seeing!",8,22 June 2018,"'TAG': Four Stars (Out of Five)A comedy about a group of adult men that have spent the month of May, every year, playing the game of tag since they were children. The film was directed by debut feature filmmaker Jeff Tomsic, and it was scripted by Mark Steilen and Rob McKittrick (who also wrote and directed the outstanding 2005 comedy 'WAITING'). The story was inspired by a Wall Street Journal article, written by Russell Adams. It stars Ed Helms, Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Isla Fisher, Annabelle Wallis, Rashida Jones and Leslie Bibb. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's a modest hit at the Box Office as well. It's entertaining enough I'd say. Hoagie (Helms), Jerry (Renner), Bob (Hamm), Randy (Johnson) and Kevin (Buress) have been playing the same game of tag since they were nine-years-old, always all through the month of May. For thirty years it's the one thing that's always brought the close friend group back together. Jerry has never been tagged, and he's about to be married. So he's quitting after this year. The other friends decide to team-up, in order to obsessively try and finally tag him. The movie has a great premise, and a great cast. It seems like Helms is cast in so many buddy comedies like this, but he never truly gets the credit he deserves for them. Renner is brilliant casting as well, and Hamm and Johnson just seem natural in their roles too. Buress is good, but he's not given enough to really do. The film is funny, but the tag scenes are a little too over-the-top for me. It feels like a slapstick action flick at times, and it's better as just a buddy comedy. The film is definitely no soon-to-be-classic (like it feels like it really wants to be), but I think it's definitely still worth seeing.",Tag

13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Does exactly what it says on the tin, for better or worse.",7,2 July 2018,"Though it's only the broad scenario that's inspired by real life as opposed to the actual narrative or characters, both aspects of 'Tag (2018)' work surprisingly well. The true story is quite cute and idyllic, though hardly movie material. That's where Rob McKittrick and Mark Steillen come in. They've written a flick that's fairly fully formed, and fairly funny, too. The adaptation comes not from those playing the game, but from the game itself and is only 'accurate' when it comes to its rules or the specific - and suitably outlandish - scenarios chosen to bring to the big-screen. The film provides plenty of laughs (honestly, more than you'd expect) and even has some nice messages perhaps counter to those most obvious. Some moments are unpredictable, with the piece playing with expectation in a neat, if somewhat contrived, way. There's still the foreseeable mix of ad-libbed nonsense that seeps into the fray which, though it delivers solid material on a number of occasions, means that the comedy comes more from the actors than the actual characters. This is a minor but noticeable issue that stops any meaty development, essentially, dead in its tracks. It doesn't ruin the pacy picture, however, as there are a some moments of change for a few of our core players. Sometimes, these don't feel quite genuine but they always stem from the right place. This lack of true character-focus does prevent the picture from becoming anything other than a fun ride that does exactly what it says on the tin, though. It is much better than it could have been and I certainly enjoyed it. It was an entertaining time that gave me a good chuckle here and there. 7/10",Tag
14,bowmanblue,A one-note comedy that could be worse,6,9 June 2019,"I'm always a little skeptical of films which say something like 'based on a true story.' However - unbelievably - this happens to be one when at least it is (partly) based on a pursuit that people really did. We've all played 'tag' when we were children (or 'it' if you were in my gang), but most of us give up 'play' like that when we grow up (or notice the opposite sex - whichever comes first). But, this film covers one group of male friends in America who don't stop playing (or at least for the month of May every year, right the way through their adult life).What follows is a bit of a 'screwball' comedy as four of the friends track down the fifth, who has - as yet - still never been tagged in their game, from childhood to present day. They figure that seeing as he's getting married, this might just be their chance to pounce. Yes, the 'stakes' are hardly high. Up against films like 'The Avengers' when the heroes are literally trying to save 50% of the universe, all that matters here is that a man gets 'touched' by a mate once.It's quite a silly film and it knows it is. The laughs come from the ensemble cast, which (mainly) includes the pairing of Ed Helms and Jon Hamm. They have the majority of the screen time and it's them who pretty much carry most of the film as they try to track down the 'untaggable' final member of the group, played by Jeremy Renner. He has the least to do of the cast, besides thwart their attempts at tagging him via a series of 'set-pieces' of action scenes which would probably look more at home with his 'Hawkeye' persona in 'The Avengers.'Isla Fisher is in their as Ed Helm's onscreen wife and she's pretty good with just the little time her character is given. However, the female journalist who is tasked with writing a story on this unusual adult pursuit is used so little I sometimes forgot she was even in the story!Overall, 'Tag' is good - harmless - fun. There are plenty of laughs to have and it's a simple story that works because of its cast. My only two criticisms were that about halfway through the film the comedy seems to rely a little too much on 'slapstick' humour where people seem to take about as much punishment as Tom and Jerry and simply walk away unscathed. Plus, seeing as this is pretty much a 'one joke' movie, it did go on a little too long. I checked my watch figuring it was nearly wrapping up (at what I believed was about the ninety minute mark) to find I was only fifty minutes in with a further fifty to go!",Tag
15,ThomasDrufke,A Surprisingly Moving Dramedy,8,9 July 2018,"In retrospect, Tag was definitely poorly marketed and a clear missed opportunity to make this film out to be something its not. Tag is a drama disguised as a comedy, and I think that's the way people should go into it thinking. Even amidst its unbelievable true source material, there is a great deal of heart that Tag delves into. Yes, this a 90 minute film based around a group of friends that plays tag every year for the entire month of May, but there's so much more beneath the surface that gets explored here. And I think most people are not critiquing the movie based on that, but rather, the failed comedic attempts in Tag. And admittedly, the movie isn't all that funny. There are some standout scenes and performances, particularly anything involving Jeremy Renner, Hannibal Buress, Leslie Bibb, and Isla Fisher. They were very funny, but the film succeeds far more in its subtle attempts at drama than it does in its blatant attempts at making you laugh. But I really enjoy the types of films that move me in a personal way. Tag does that due to my nostalgia for my childhood playing outside with my neighborhood friends. The idea of having something like that end for any number of reasons always saddened me. And the reality is, those things don't live on forever. So when Tag explores those themes it really hit home. Maybe that wasn't exactly the filmmakers intentions, but that's the way I interpreted the film. Sometimes that's all you need to connect to a film.8.5/10",Tag
16,Cineanalyst,That it's Stupid isn't the Problem,2,21 November 2018,"I saw a trailer for ""Tag,"" so I knew I was in for an inane premise of male 30-to-40-somethings continuing a game of tag that they've been playing since childhood. Heck, I chose to see it for that very reason--in addition to the vain hope that it wouldn't also be awash in sentimentality. But, of course, it is, and it ruins any chance--albeit, already slim--that this high-concept picture could've risen to the level of a guilty pleasure or a movie so bad that it's good. Repeatedly, it's claimed in the story that the game has kept them friends and young, and, in a sense, that's likely true for the actors playing these characters. As actors, they're playing, and the significant pay that stars like Ed Helms, Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner receive for it, indeed, extends their life expectancy and potential quality of life--keeping them young.Unfortunately, even the silly tag stuff isn't very funny. So much of the timing just seems off, and the way the picture is assembled is clichéd and obvious. There's slow-motion action scenes with voiceover narration for character thoughts and cutaway flashbacks that were supposed to be amusing. For an R-rated comedy, its raunchiness is slight, too, with even jokes about gay sex and waterboarding, among other things, coming off as tame and as half-heartedly politically correct as the casting of an African American as the least used of the tag players and the partial inclusion of women in the fun. Meanwhile, Renner plays the part of possibly the greatest tag player in the world (just imagine his Hawkeye from the ""Avengers"" movies if all the villains were lava trying to touch him, and Hawkeye had no bow and arrows). For the most part, he did so with both arms broken--reportedly requiring considerable CGI work on his arms, but it also may explain why his character so often just stands there as others approach before some quick modern-day-action-movie cuts (again, as in the MCU). In reality, such an injury would likely reduce Renner to being as bad at tag as this movie is.",Tag

It tells the story of a group of friends who have been playing the same elaborate game of tag ever since they were kids as a charming way of keeping one another in their lives.The concept is kind of cute, but totally wasted here.First of all the biggest flaw to Tag is that it's another one of these big Hollywood comedies that forgot it's a comedy. What I mean by that is it simply isn't very funny and get's really serious at times which totally takes the fun out of it.Sure it has it's moment, I did laugh and it has a few thought provoking original segments but they are far to few in number.I'd have love to have seen what a competent writer could do with this concept, whoever wrote this dropped the ball and dropped it hard.Passable harmless stuff, but not funny enough to be a comedy and not dramatic enough to be a drama.

22,The-Sarkologist,A bit of a downer.,4,13 April 2019,"Well, when this film was in the cinemas I was sort of in two minds about seeing it, and in the end decided to pass on it for something a little more productive (like completing assignments). Well, since I have now subscribed to Netflix it turns out that this little film has landed up in their library, so I decided that it might be worth sitting down and watching it, even if it has something to do with the concept.This film is based on a true story, and involves a game that we would play as kids - tag. However, these guys have decided that they would continue it into their adulthood, and every May they will engage in what is effectively a no holds barred game of Tag. There is one catch though - Hawkeye, I mean Jerry, has never, ever been tagged, and apparently he is getting married, and bailing out as well.
Well, there are some rules in the game, namely that it only happens in May, the last person tagged becomes it the next year, and no women are allowed (though of course, if only the original guys are allowed to play, then the no woman aspect of the game really doesn't make any sense). However, it is interesting the lengths that these guys go to to play the game during the month, even going as far as getting employed at one of their workplaces, putting on disguises and then touching them.However, it is Jerry, I mean Hawkeye, that is the goal here, because apparently he is very, very good at not getting caught. In fact, he runs his own gym due to this particular skill that he has. Oh, he is also pretty perceptive, though honestly, that aspect of the film seems to have borrowed heavily from Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. Oh, and when I say no holds barred, well, I mean it, because people will go to incredible lengths to either tag, or not get tagged, including faking some very serious stuff.Still, I wouldn't necessarily consider the film to be all that great, and the ending was a bit of a downer as well. Okay, they may be trying to make it somewhat more realistic, though I'm not entirely sure how close to real events they followed (with the exception of the Wall Street Journal reporter following them around of course). Still, I thought that it could have ended on a much lighter note, and also with what had happened previously in the film, I have no idea whether they were lying or not in the end either.",Tag
23,UniqueParticle,It's a blast!,9,22 June 2018,"I laughed a lot, great moments, fun movie with no boring moments. I love the way it was filmed; Hanibal Buress & Jeremy Renner were excellent! Also I love when Jake Johnson says she's too intense referring to Isla Fisher. One of the funniest scenes is when 3 of the cast are standing in a circle tagging each other that was hilarious. It's an all around great movie; I'll probably buy it in 4K or Blu-Ray when it becomes available.",Tag
24,cruise01,Hilarious and fun.,8,1 September 2018,"Tag (4 out of 5 stars).Tag is a comedy film filled with stupid humor, a great cast, and a plot that is ridiculous (but it is a true story). Yes, a plot that involves grown man playing a game of tag and taking it very seriously. Literally. But it is a story of friendship and the game of tag is the only thing that keeps them connected as they grow older and live their separate lives. The plot follows Hoagie (Ed Helms), Bob (Jon Hamm), Chilli (Jake Johnson), and Kevin (Hannibal Buress) who are traveling to Washington cause their friend Jerry (Jeremy Renner) is about to get married. And during the month of May, they all play a game of tag and the one person that has not been tagged yet is Jerry. Only thing is Jerry is well prepared and has everything planned out for escape routes and tricks up his sleeve to preventing his friends from getting close.It is a ridiculous plot. Such as Hoagie has a degree and is willing to go through a job interview process for a big company to land a job as a janitor. In order to get close to Bob. Or Hoagie using his maniac wife Anna (Isla Fisher) to try to trap the guys in a corner. It is a fun plot. It does have a story of friendship and how close and distant they got from each other. Even with a sub plot when Cheryl (Rashida Jones) shows up to Jerry wedding rehearsal which Bob and Chilli both have a crush on since elementary school. Jerry is the mastermind. He is hidden in his basement leaving trails for his friends to fall into a trap. Such as playing cat and mouse in the forest with several people running around dressed like him. And log traps and net traps set up for his friends. Sure, things may be out of hand with the game. But the movie is entertainment. It is funny throughout. It has a lot of stupid humor. But it works. When Bob is threatening the gym receptionist after bribing him did not work to reveal Jerry's location. Even the thought of water boarding him was coming into play. The cast was great. Ed Helms was great. Almost feels like the same character he was playing in The Hangover movie. Jeremy Renner was good as a professional player. A little too skilled. Almost every escape route he takes leaves him breaking out of a window. Jon Hamm was good. Jake Johnson playing a stoner who is always high and smoking weed throughout. Hannibal Buress plays a character that does not make sense but has too many problems mentally. Isla Fisher was great playing Hoagie's wife. A lady who has mood swings from being sweet and nice to a complete out of control anger issues. Annabelle Wallis was good but her character did not have much to do with the movie. Besides the group of guys explaining to her how their version of the game works so she can write about it.The film does take for a serious turn in the climax. Sometimes a little too serious when jokes are taken so far. If some would find it funny or sensitive on the jokes that is portrayed.Overall, Tag is a good comedy film. The humor is stupid and hilarious throughout. The plot is ridiculous but fun. And the cast was great.",Tag
25,Floated2,Mediocre silly comedy,3,7 July 2019,"Seeing the previews and trailers for this film, one would come to expect the type of film this was made out to be. Tag is quite an over the top and overly silly movie. With a simple plot just about a group of friends who have been playing this game of tag as children and into their adult lives 30 years later.The problem with this film is that it isn't funny, and the jokes are more missfires and feels forced at times. The actors do a decent job, as they are likeable for their roles. Jeremy Renner steals his scenes as he is the best part of the film.Tag is just too silly, not filled with enough good jokes and the vulgar didn't help it. Overall when we think about it, the concept is just silly and hard to believe it is ""inspired by real events"" as it says in the opening credits. Then we see footage after the end credits showing a group of grown friends portraying in on the act of ""tag"". Although it looks somewhat staged.",Tag
26,eddie_baggins,"An hilariously over the top comedy, Tag is well worth your time",7,17 June 2018,"One of the more random true stories to be adapted for the big screen in recent times, Tag is for all intents and purposes an extremely silly and over the top comedy but one that knows and understands what it is and is all the better for it.Directed by first time director Jeff Tomsic and featuring an all-star cast led by Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress and Jeremy Renner, with help from the underused female supports Isla Fischer, Annabelle Wallis, Rashida Jones and Leslie Bibb, Tag is quite literally a film about a bunch of adults trying to beat each other at the game we here in Australia call chasey/tiggy but it's also a subtlety affecting examination on friendship and finding reasons to remain in each other's life, which makes Tag become such an enjoyable watch from start to finish.Based on the original Wall Street Journal article published in 2013, Tag features little titbits of the real life story its based upon but recognising the absurdity of the real-life game played by a group of long-term friends one month every year, Tomsic and his cast aim for the over the top and deliver and ensure that Tag never takes itself too seriously, which allows us as an audience to accept what we are in for and go along for the constantly moving ride.Focussing its attentions on Helm's determined Hoagie, Hamm's self-assured Callahan, Johnson's no-hoper Chilli and Buress's mild-mannered Sable trying their best to ""tag"" Jeremy Renner's champion player Jerry before he gets hitched and retires from the game as the uncatchable player, we are thrust into a series of completely over the top yet often hilarious high-stakes scenes of attempts to catch-out Jerry and the film's ability to craft an energy and frenetic nature to these moments really stands out as the does the cast's ability to build up a solid chemistry together.Led by Helms and Hamm who are both having a real blast in their respective roles, everyone gets a moment to shine here with supporting players Fischer and Renner both stealing the MVP chocolates with their fun turns and come the films surprisingly touching finale you begin to realise that you've grown attached to these characters despite the silliness and mayhem that surrounds them.Final Say - If dumb comedies aren't your thing, Tag is a film to run very quickly away from but for anyone that heads into this hilariously true tale with the right mindset, Tag will become one of the more easy to enjoy and likeable comedies released this year and a likely inspiration to get your old chasey buddies together for one last game.3 ½ waterboarding's out of 5",Tag
27,TheMovieDiorama,"Tag shouts ""You're It!"" through fun slow motion carnage and true friendship.",6,4 July 2018,"You would think a group of grown men playing tag once a month every year would make for a silly disposable comedy, right? Well, you're right. Is that necessarily a negative to the film? Not in the slightest. It's just plain fun. Four of the five friends meet up at the start of their ""tag season"" to plan an ambush on their untaggable friend, who remains the champion of tag. Rapidly, the game is afoot! On the surface, it resembles a story about friendship (especially as it's based on a true story). Being able to maintain a close relationship with friends for such a long duration of time is a testament and a rarity in itself, where occasionally this gratifying eternal game of tag intrudes on their personal lives. However, if you look beyond the game itself you will find that it's a story about maturity. Balancing the inevitability of ageing with the persistence of retaining stupid fun. It's something, regrettably, I wish I did with my friends. The game of tag is a plot device in grouping the friends together on an annual basis, and it works. This is a film where its success hangs on the balance of its cast members. Fortunately, they exhume natural chemistry. Hamm, Buress, Johnson and even Helms (who I didn't hate!) felt like true friends, as if acting wasn't required. Renner, performing most of the action, clearly looked like he was enjoying himself. That in itself is very contagious. Tomsic's usage of slow motion during the tag scenes elevated the comedic intensity that the screenplay may have lacked. The latter is the weakest element, relying on crude humour and some rather insensitive material. The joke about the miscarriage was unnecessary and seemingly felt ridiculously prolonged. The tag scenes themselves could've been more inventive and outlandish, which would've enhanced the memorability of this comedy. Also, the male dominant onscreen antics felt rather fatigued, with Fisher and Wallis frequently sidelined. Alas, it knows what it is. A high concept disposable comedy that makes for a good time rather than a long time.",Tag

29,southdavid,Warning Label,5,10 July 2018,"""Tag"" is a very loose adaptation of a newspaper article about a group of friends who have been playing a game of Tag for 30 years. In this version, where the slapstick and violence have been increased for comic effect, four friends played by Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress and John Hamm combine forces to try and finally tag Jerry played by Jeremy Renner, who has never been caught before and has honed his skills to almost precognition levels. All the cast are generally playing the sort of roles that we've seen them play before. They are mostly likable, if a little dull. Which is also a fair assessment of the film. ""Tag's"" problems are almost exclusively regarding the tone of the picture. Fairly quickly it abandons reality for a scene of a chase through an apartment building that ends with one character taking a spine destroying pratfall at the conclusion, he shrugs this off to continue the plot. This would be fine, if later on the film didn't include scenes regarding substance abuse, miscarriages and serious medical illness. The jarring nature of this shift really dragged me away from what I thought was a fun if slight movie up until that point and I feel like it's going to be a real trigger for some people who are after a bit of escapist humour.Instantly forgettable, apart from the misjudged moments, don't bother tagging in for this one.",Tag

31,jtindahouse,A solid comedy that has more than just humour going for it,8,5 April 2020,"I read in the trivia section for 'Tag' that Will Ferrell and Jack Black were at one point a part of the cast. A part of me would really like them to have been there, but another part of me wonders if the film wasn't almost better off without them. They are incredibly talented comedic actors who would thrive in a chaotic film like this, however if they are in the film then it becomes their film (Ferrell especially). It becomes ""Have you seen the latest Will Ferrell film?"" rather than ""Have you seen the film about the guys who play tag?"" Because one of the strengths of 'Tag' is that no one dominates the film. It is an ensemble cast where everyone plays their part.I wondered how they were going to make this film work. On the surface the concept sounds wonderful, but a game of tag could get very tedious over a 100 minute runtime. Structuring the story around one of the guys never having been tagged was very smart. It gave the film both life and legs.The films ending was handled quite strangely for me. Interestingly I would consider the final scene to be the strongest in the whole movie. However under the surface the film turns both surprisingly dark and also quite ambiguous. I actually kind of respect it for going the route that it did. I suppose I just didn't really see it coming (which is a good thing right?). 'Tag' is consistently funny without ever being what you may refer to as hilarious. What it does lack in humour at times though it makes up for through fun and heart. 'Tag' is a comedy that I would happily recommend.",Tag
32,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,29 December 2018,"It really is just funny. If you're looking for more than a funny movie it's time to question why you're watching Tag.The strength is the casting. Everyone did a great job, but there are three highlights I feel the need to specifically praise:Jake Johnson plays the best perpetual stoner friend I've seen since Brad Pitt in True Romance. He's both relatable and completely exaggerated, and he pulls both off with ease.Isla Fisher was, well, the best way to describe her is: ""consistently hysterical."" She was so aggressively over-the-top that her scenes were a delight to watch. She was able to capture a specific personality trait of a certain type of person everyone knows, and then believably exaggerate it to hysterical proportions. She delivered what was probably the best comedic performance in 2018.And Jeremy Renner was able to play the aloof living McGuffin perfectly straight and believable no matter how absurd his scenes were. They say comedy is best delivered straight and he proves the statement true and adds a graceful timing to his performance.Unfortunately it's not going to be remembered, but it might be a cult classic if for no other reason that the characters were perfectly cast for their individual roles.Ultimately, when all is said and done, Tag will make you laugh, and that really was the point of both making the film and watching the film. In my book that's a success.",Tag
33,stevendbeard,Never Grow Old,7,16 June 2018,"I saw ""Tag"", starring Ed Helms-Chappaquiddick, Semi_Pro; Jon Hamm-Baby Driver, The Town; Isla Fisher-Nocturnal Animals, Hot Rod and Jeremy Renner-Arrival The Town.
Believe it or not, this is based on a true story about a group of guys that played the game of tag, as kids, and made it an annual game they continued playing for 30 years, into their 40's. They claimed that it kept them close as friends and their motto was 'You don't stop playing because you grow old, you grow old because you stop playing'-and I may not have the exact wording of it right but that was the gist of it. They had their rules. It was only in the month of May. No girls could play-remember, they were kids when they wrote it. Whoever was tagged last at the end of the month, had to start the next game the following year-you could say he was 'It' for a year. And sometimes, they would travel all over the country-some may have moved-and they would have to get inventive in their means of tagging their prey. Ed, Jon and Jeremy are 3 of the guys and Isla is Ed's wife. She likes to tag along for the fun-Ha Ha, I said tag along-plus she gets super charged up during the game, as she coaches on her husband, using strings of profanity. Jeremy has never been tagged-he is real athletic and has a super human Spidey sense as he moves like a ninja-and when Ed tells the rest of the gang that Jeremy is getting married and retiring from the game, they go all out in trying to get him before it's too late. During the end credits, they show the actual guys in action-I guess they used to film themselves at work-tagging each other in unexpected ways. One is caught in a shower and there is some brief nudity.

37,kirbylee70-599-526179,WHY AREN'T COMEDIES FUNNY?,3,4 October 2018,"Apparently I've become the curmudgeon I always thought I'd never become. I've often asked people when they thought the best movies ever made were. What I've found is that while most think it was when they were younger more and more tend to think of films from the 70s and 80s as the best. Growing up in that time period I know I'm biased and admit it. But I am stunned when I see certain movies today and how terribly bad they are. Take for instance TAG.The plot of the film is supposedly based on a true story. A group of friends has had an ongoing game of tag since they were 9 years old in 1983. As they got older the game became an annual event taking place every May. Hogan ""Hoagie"" Malloy (Ed Helms) was the last person tagged the previous year and he has set his goal high this year. That's because his goal is to tag Jerry Pierce (Jeremy Renner), the only player in the game who has never been ""it"". To do so Hoagie recruits his fellow players starting with Bob Callahan (Jon Hamm), the CEO of an insurance company. Showing up at work he tags him and sets in motion his plan for all the members to focus on Jerry this year. Those members include Randy ""Chilli"" Cilliano (Jake Johnson), a perpetual stoner still, and Kevin Sable (Hannibal Buress) perhaps the only sane one of the group. Along for support is Hoagie's overly enthusiastic wife Anna (Isla Fisher). Also in the group is Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis) a Wall Street Journal reporter doing a piece on Bob. What makes this year's game more difficult is the fact that Jerry is about to get married. None of the friends were invited for fear they would ruin the day with the game. In return for invitations the group must not play the game at the various wedding functions to take place. They all agree and then the game begins. As the impending wedding approaches the group does everything in their power to tag Jerry. But Jerry is a planner and skilled athlete and avoids them at all turns. They sneak into his house and he's prepared to that possibility. They show up at a function and he's ready and waiting with a pre-planned escape route. SPOILER ALERT! As the last chance to tag him approaches they get a message that the wedding has been postponed only to find out this is a ruse. The game must go on!The movie sounds like great fun and the trailers for it made it appear that it would be just that. The end product is far from it. The jokes are lame and predictable for the most part. The acting is over the top throughout the film, especially from Fisher. But there were several things about the movie that were just not funny.Keeping in mind that growing up movies like BLAZING SADDLES and THE GROOVE TUBE provided plenty of things to offend viewers and yet remained funny. But this film goes beyond that in several ways. The reason they say the marriage is postponed is because the bride had a miscarriage. Somehow I don't find a lot of humor in a woman losing her child. When it turns out that this was a hoax it made it just as uncaring a concept.The movie seems fueled by the F bomb as well. Fisher seems to spout it out every fourth or fifth word and more so when she goes into tirades about the game her husband is playing in support of him. I understand that this is becoming more and more acceptable to many (a recent trip to a restaurant was ruined by 2 young men who felt it was okay to punctuate sentences with the word while we sat nearby) but its overuse does not make something funny. What it does is demonstrate lazy film writing. The film might look great and polished but the end result is whether or not it was funny. Especially since the movies is promoted as a comedy. I found that while watching the entire 1 hour and 40 minutes of the film I found one laugh. At one point the reporter says ""This is why journalism is dying"". That's it. The single laugh in the film. Sorry if I ruined it for you but if you want to see this movie for that single line you would have wasted the rental money.It seems like more and more comedies are relying on vulgarity and gross out tactics to get a laugh these days and the more they do so the less funny they are. They're no longer shocking they're just sick. Worst of all they're not funny. Consider TAG as one of the un-funniest comedies this year.",Tag

Tagging You Into This Review,8,15 June 2018,"Childhood games and traditions may seem silly, but with them comes a pact that helps solidify the friendships that start with them. Based on true events, today's review is based on events of a group of guys who played Tag for almost three decades and the craziness that came with it. Another comedy arrives this weekend and yours truly is here to help get your movie going experience on, or not depending on the movie. Let's gets started as I review: Movie: Tag (2018)Director:
 Jeff Tomsic
Writers:
 Rob McKittrick (screenplay by), Mark Steilen (screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Jeremy Renner, Ed Helms, Jake JohnsonLIKES: Good Pace: A movie about a childhood game requires a good pace to capture that energy and Tag succeeds in securing this. The movie constantly keeps the gang on their toes, as the crew makes attempts to discover the whereabouts of Jerry (Jeremy Renner) and then execute their plans. Most of the scenes are high adrenaline bouts of running, with obstacles courses, clever dodges, and a few other moves. It keeps up the fun of the movie and does little to venture off the course of bringing you back into your youth.Surprisingly Deep: While it is a comedy, Tag somehow manages to take a break away from the silliness by getting into the character stories. As a balance between fun and depth, the movie does a unique job presenting the background history, by using the temporarily lapses in the excitement to interview the crew. Rebecca (Annabelle Wallis) is an interviewer who gets dragged into the adventure, and to further understand the trend, asks the group how things evolved. Through this story, the characters evolve, and the relationship dives into something much more emotionally charged than I ever expected. Funny: Is the comedy funny? Yes it is, and the movie does a nice job of broadening the comedic styles across the board to not only help each character stand out, but keep the comedy fresh and fun. I myself enjoyed the physical comedy of the group, which felt like a more ridiculous version of Home Alone's stunts. In addition, Hannibal Buress dry, monotone delivery was perfect to offset all the yelling, high drug and angry comedy that the rest brought. Matched with the energy of the movie, the comedy helped rejuvenate the youthful energy of the movie and keep everything fun to watch. Good Balance of Characters: My concerns for actors getting underutilized was misplaced for once, and Tag was able to keep everyone practically involved in the adventure. Much of this has to do with the presentation of backstory and modern-day planning, but everyone who gets pulled into the game stays in the game... in a nonthreatening manner that is. And thanks to the blend of comedy styles, every character is very well utilized to further expand the game at hand. 
DISLIKES:Crosses the line sometimes: Some of the styles in this movie are very dark and mature. It's these elements that sometimes cross way over the line, jumping into topics that aren't worth joking about. Super competitive people will relish in the tactics used to win, but for me, the writers sometimes went a little too far in impeding the sanctity of things that needed to be impeded on. Sexual Innuendo Banter: Innuendos are a great device when deployed sparingly and timed right. Tag accomplishes this goal well, but there are a few moments where the aggressive comedy diverges from the path to just stuff more sexual antics into the mix. One of these times was completely unnecessary, a lead that was doomed to fail and could have been edited out. When the banter about this stuff continues to occur, it got old due to how irrelevant it needed. Over the Top At Times: The whole movie is over the top, I get that, but sometimes it flew sky high into the childish and moronic territories. The game of tag has a lot of stakes to winning, and when competitiveness gets in the way, the adrenaline rush causes one to do stupid things. However, this movie takes it a little too far, leading to yes amusing antics at times, but other times very destructive habits that again crossed a line not only into illegal areas, but stupid territory again. Isla Fisher's Character: This has nothing to do with the actress herself, but the direction they took her in. Anna is a firecracker to say it nicely, but the direction had her a little too obnoxious and bipolar for my liking. At times it came off well, but other times it was just annoying to see her aggressively yell, curse, or sometimes strike a person for no reason. It never got any better for me, and some of my fellow movie goers agreed that her character may have been the weakest link of the group. Still, you want that firecracker wild woman, you are in the right area. 
The Verdict: Tag is a movie that doesn't sell you short on the simplistic, fun, youthful adventure that it is. It's a ridiculous, over the top comedy that is incredibly entertaining and should keep you in the film for the entire ride. With a great ensemble and multiple styles integrated together, one should find a few laughs held in the confines of this game. Despite the surprising depth to the movie, the ridiculous antics, cursing/dirty comedy still cross the line and Fisher's character didn't help to maintain the balance they would have strived for. Still, the movie succeeds in recapturing the spirit of youth, and is worth a trip to the theater as a group or date movie. If you can't catch that together, then save your money for the rental service and wait for next week's flick. My scores: Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5",Tag
45,invisibleunicornninja,Stupid and Immature.,7,17 June 2018,"I had a lot of fun watching this movie. I wasn't expecting a lot out of this film, other than to be entertained, and I definitely was. If you try to take this movie seriously, you are not going to have a good time. Some of these situations get hilariously out of hand and there are plenty of scenes of people jumping off roofs without injuries. They did what I was hoping would happen, which is have the situations get more and more insane while all the characters stay extremely serious about everything that is happening. The guy who plays Hawkeye is more badass in this movie than he is in the Avengers, which is pretty funny in it of itself. This movie is actually very well shot with lots of long takes and interesting angles, which I was not expecting. All the acting was fantastic and the action was well-done. I'm not saying that this movie is a masterpiece, but its a lot of fun and worth seeing in theaters. If you do see it, don't forget to hang around for the end credits, which were pretty funny.",Tag
46,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Tag,4,2 July 2018,"Tag is my latest review and a misconstrued spotlight for the city of Spokane, Washington. It's a film about the game of tag, its adjoining of lifelong friendship, and its silly tag along amendments. Heck, Tag might be the very first pic to ever dabble in the subject of said game. Now would I rightly recommend Tag? No. Would I call its premise a little too lightweight? Yes. Would I deem Tag to be stupid funny and effectively doltish? In small moments. Finally, would I say that Tag is a rare genre trailblazer? Again no.Anyway, I knew Tag's chancy trailer would doom it from the start. Tag is based on true events via a story in The Wall Street Journal. I couldn't make this up. A group of middle age men have been playing the same game of tag for over thirty years and yup, they only do it in the month of May. Man that's goofy. Something tells me that these dudes are a little off. Also, it seems that they are starving for attention, are bent on scarring their families, and want a peek at fifteen minutes of fame. In hindsight, Tag is not heinous but it has shades of being a cinematic ""red flag"". You should never trust a movie in which its production company contains the words ""broken"" and ""road"".Tag is directed by a TV helmer (Jeff Tomsic) and penned by two writers (Rob McKittrick and Mark Steilen). It's a poor man's Hangover ""makeover"". Tag's recycled screenplay reeks of penis jokes, pot quips, bland improvisation, and homophobic innuendo. Basically it feels as though it was written about fifteen years ago. With the addition of an old school hip-hop soundtrack, some R-rated dialect, a messed up waterboarding scene, and some slo-mo, Jason Bourne-like fight sequences, Tag tries to mask how trivial and flimsy it really is. In truth, it's hard to make an efficacious movie about sneaking up on someone and simply tapping them on the shoulder. Maybe a horror version of blind man's bluff or Capture the Flag might have been a better option. In conclusion, Tag stars Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Jon Hamm, Hannibal Buress, and Jeremy Renner. They are the five friends who partake in the pastime of tag and never know how to venture past pubescence. Helms and Johnson are basically playing the same sad sack characters as in all their other movies. And yes, Hannibal Buress is pretty much doing the same line reading shtick as he did when he co-starred in the Neighbors vehicles. As for Jon Hamm and Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner, well they need to scold their agents for recommending that they appear in something as asinine as Tag. Bottom line: If you must, see Tag once but don't get ""tagged"" along into seeing it again. Rating: 1 and a half stars.",Tag
47,Kingslaay,Good fun,7,24 June 2018,"Most of us going into this film would have probably known that Tag is not an Oscar contender. It would be a fun and entertaining comedy which is one of the main purposes of going to the cinema. To enjoy and have this experience, for the most part Tag serves this purpose. The main story is unique and fun to watch and surprisingly based on a true story of friends. The intensity and devotion with which the game is played is amusing. From John Hamm not caring about his interview with the WSJ to Jeremy Renner's character going to great lengths to maintain his streak. The film could have been funnier. Having such a trivial and different plot is a vehicle for all kinds of humour and absurdity. For the most part the jokes were R rated but some worked quite well. The characters could have been made very different with different career paths who join up for the game. The list of possible improves can go on. Overall not too bad. 7/10",Tag
48,eric262003,A True Story of Keeping the Game Alive,7,26 February 2019,"Inspired by true events based off of an article by the Wall Street Journal, ""Tag"" tells the story of group of friends from the Pacific Northwest area as they embark on a game of tag that they have been playing every May for over thirty years. The game is fun and all that, but the principal goal for the gang is finally get their hands on one particular participate who has dodged being tagged is their longtime friend and fellow participant Jerry Pierce (Jeremy Renner) who seems to use his athleticism and intelligence to his advantage and is soon to be married to Susan Rollins (Leslie Bibb). This may be their last chance to tag Jerry as he may drop out of the game. To prove that this movie is not convoluted work of fiction, the film shows archive footage of the real characters that this movie was based on as we see them incognito, engaging in silly pranks, and stalking them in showers all for the sake of saying those two dreaded words, ""You're it.""The group abide the words of the this philosophical mantra phrased by James Holmes ""You don't stop playing because you get old, You get old because you stop playing."" They say that Ben Franklin coined that phrase which is quite untrue. Though the guys which includes one of the guy's wife (Isla Fisher) use this game of tag as a decoy way so that they could keep in contact all these years, which is for a good cause due to so many former high-school teens drift away and never hear from each other ever again. But what's surreal is that these guys must so wealthy to put all their resources together for this one game of tag plus they must have unlimited free time on their hands.""Tag"" is about as illogical as it comes, but once get to realize that , you could bask into the surrealism and enjoy the ride. Jerry is tough nugget who not dodges being tagged but also places traps like a mouse in a cartoon to outsmart his friends just to preserve his undefeated streak and will even get his fiancee involved in this nonsense. His friends will do anything to finally catch the one who gets away. The story begins with Hogan Malloy (Ed Helms) a veterinarian who applies for a job as a custodian at the company that his friend and CEO Bob Callahan (Jon Hamm) works just to take in friend and fellow tagger in while being interviewed by a Wall Street Journal reporter (Annabelle Wallis). This catches the attention of the reporter as she is more interested in the game than the company that Bob works for and joins along on the fun as they try to catch The Untouchable Jerry Pierce.Though in all for fun, Jerry does lay out some restrictions in their quest to catch him. The gang are to lay off him as he gets married and to back off during the rehearsal dinner. Other than that everything's fair game including his AA meetings. The gang goes to great lengths to catch their foe including paying off individuals like there's nothing else that matters in the world. Though the reason for this reunion takes a turn for a much darker plot twist.The movie was very entertaining in spite of the surrealism that comes along for the ride and the performers all look like they're having a good time. The real standout performance comes from Jeremy Renner who was excellent as the mysterious untouchable tagger. His resourcefulness is so impressive you remain intrigued as to he'll escape getting tagged by the others and it's handled with great comic timing. There may have been some scenes used for comical or dramatization licensing but looking through the actual footage, it seems highly unlikely.",Tag

51,phubbs,Tag,7,21 January 2019,"Believe it or not but this movie is actually based on a true story about a group of adult men that actually play tag for an entire month each year. This story came to light via an article in the Wall Street Journal. I don't think any of the movies characters were actually based on this group of gentlemen, but their actions do seem to be, albeit over the top.Long story short, if you can call this a long story. Five chaps have been playing tag since they were kids. During the month of May its open season for the man who's 'it' to try and tag another and so on. Last man 'it' at the end of the month remains so until the following May. This time four of the men (Ed Helms as Hoagie, Jon Hamm as Bob, Jake Johnson as Chilli, and Hannibal Buress as Kevin) decide to team up to try and tag Jerry (Jeremy Renner) as he has never been tagged due to his overall awesomeness. Jerry plans on 'retiring' from the game untagged.Now I know what you're thinking, how the fudge can you make a movie out of the kid's playground game tag? Well bottom line you can't, and this movie pretty much shows that. The entire notion of grown men running after each other or trying to covertly touch each other and claim 'tag! You're it!' is absurd. When you start to think about this logically, and whilst watching this movie, it just doesn't add up at all. Like sure you could sneak up on someone and tag them, but considering they could be in a crowded supermarket or at home on the couch completely oblivious to anything, well it's hardly challenging is it.Naturally this movie does its best to conjure up these inventive scenarios where the guys are trying to basically use military manoeuvres to tag their prey. And yes I can't deny there are some great little sequences here showcasing some inventive chaos. I did enjoy the slow-motion action sequences as the guys try to apprehend Jerry whilst at the same time being accompanied by commentary from within Jerry's mind (lovely 'Point Break' homage in here also). Overall it's a nice humorous touch hearing how Jerry breaks down each attempted attack so he can evade being tagged. But God damn you gotta suspend your disbelief because there is just no way someone could evade being 'touched' in these over the top spats. I was sitting watching this movie just thinking...'it looks cool, but seriously, just jump on the guy!'.Despite the sheer lunacy on display here the characters are also quite relatable and enjoyable to watch. The crux of the plot is Jerry getting married and the guys agreeing to hold off on the game at wedding related events. But as said time after time each attempt is foiled by Jerry's skillful athleticism and trickery. This all culminates in Jerry's fiancée having a miscarriage just when it looks as though the boys will actually tag Jerry. But is this another of Jerry's clever tricks? Up to this point the characters have generally been your typical goofballs, but when the action takes a serious turn it's actually quite impressive how moving and engaging these guys become.Admittedly Ed Helms pretty much plays the same character he always does, but his characters U-turn ending is definitely unpredicted and showcases some genuinely solid acting. Both Hamm and Johnson are fun but at the same time Hamm kinda seems miscast, he looks too stern, too good looking, too strong, like he should be crushing the others. Renner is also believable as the super suave tag player Jeremy, he does 'cocky' well. But I felt that maybe Hamm and Renner could of swapped roles. As for Buress, I have literally no clue how this guy was cast because he can't act, he isn't funny, and he can hardly talk or walk properly (was that part of the character or a real-life problem?). I can only guess it was the usual quota box-ticking at play again.Whilst the plot does indeed get better as it progresses (surprisingly) you cannot deny that overall it's insanely stupid. At one point the guys pay some dude $2500 just for information on Jerry! Really?? They actually have a golf cart chase sequence. Jerry sets up numerous Ewok-like booby traps throughout some woods to ensnare the others. A reporter who was originally doing a story on Bob (he was a CEO) decides to follow the guys around to record their antics instead when Bob goes off with them (would a reporter just go off to record some blokes literally acting the fool?).This movie basically relies on a few key elements such as physical comedy, frat boy humour, and spoofery. Overall it does actually work in part although it's wholly outlandish to the max. The whole time you just can't get over the fact these guys are playing tag! It's an odd one, whilst the cast is solid none of them gel much as a team or as friends throughout the story. It's like none of them have anything much in common despite being friends their whole lives. But you could argue that was the whole idea and this silly game was keeping their friendships alive. Or you could say that's a cop out and the actors just don't gel (bad casting). Either way the movie is surprisingly enjoyable when I fully expected a load of tosh honesty.7/10",Tag
52,aciessi,Game Over.,2,16 June 2018,"Tag, you're it. Based on the true story of a group of men who spend decades tagging each other across the country in order to keep in touch and stay in each others lives. The extent to which they went was truly incredible. This would make for an incredible documentary. But instead, Hollywood wanted to rework the story into a high concept comedy. Not a bad gamble. But you could have done so much with this. The creativity, the fun, the mayhem. You could have done anything. ANYTHING, but what they did here.Tag is a colossal bomb. It's a sleepwalking comedy, hoping to God that it's concept is so high energy, it could negate the fact that nearly nothing funny was attributed to it. It wouldn't matter if these guys were playing Tiddlywinks, they'd manage to make it suck. Button, button, who's got the stop button? Helms, Renner, Johnson and Hamm want us all to believe they've got the chops here. They're forced to a frightening degree. The only one that is naturally funny is Hannibal Buress, who saved this film from being a walk-out for me. He's a deadpan genius, who could take any mundane line or joke and turn it into gold. Isla Fischer is also a trip. Nonetheless, this is a chore. Aside from a creative scene in the forrest, the endless possibilities of tagging are neglected here in favor of horrendous improv comedy. I want out.",Tag

It also has a great soundtrack and being really well shot.The ensemble cast is superb and well cast, everyone of the group brings their own comedic side to the character that they portray which makes everyone unique and funny.

54,RforFilm,Your it! Tag is a funny comedy. Who would have thought a movie about guys touching each other would be touching,7,18 June 2018,"Making friends as an adult can be hard enough, but what about keeping those friends? It's not to say we drift all the time (even though this does happen), but when our own lives become filled with normal responsibilities like work, family, and significant others, how do we maintain that connection. Many would argue that social media has been able to fill that void. While it does give us a way to connect, it still doesn't replace the day-to-day meet and greet. I personally try to organize a way to meet up at least once a month whether it's a movie, a game night, or whatever.What I love about today's movie is that it understands that a lot of friends would do stupid stuff just for the sake of doing it...as long as it doesn't go too far. Probably one of my favorite memories from middle school in which my buds and I spent three years creating our own theme park on the computer game Roller Coaster Tycoon. There was no reason for it, but we had fun passing it around to see if we could make the greatest...or at least craziest theme park. You could do that...or you could play tag like a group of friends does in Tag. Right off the mat were introduced to several men. We have a doctor Hogan (played by Ed Helms), a business tycoon Bob (played by Jon Hamm), a stoner Randy (played by Jake Johnson), and a anxious hypochondriac Kevin (played by Hannibal Buress). Even since they were kids, they would spend the month of May playing the simple game of tag. On their thirtieth year of playing, a Wall Street Journal journalist Rebecca (played by Annabelle Wallis) is following them to write about it.The guys vow to make it the year they finally tag their one friend who has never been touched, Jerry (played by Jeremy Renner). Jerry happens to be getting married that month and see this as the chance to get him when he's vulnerable. They guys make a pack that wedding parties and the ceremony are off limits, but otherwise state that anything else goes. Much of the time is spent seeing who can tag who, trying harder to get Jerry and just having fun.Honestly, I can say that Tag is the kind of shenanigans comedy that I really like. Where Action Park didn't establish enough genuine fun, this is the kind of dangerous stuff that I probably would have done if my friends were to do this. This works for a lot of reasons, but let's start off with the most important, the chemistry. All five of these stars, including Jeremy Renner, all feel like friends that have known each other for a while. They make a lot of banter and taunting, the kind that a lot of guys would have. But there does seem to be a lot of underlying heart. The fact that they get so intense with their team of tag, that abandoning it would be like a death in the family. Something like Tag could have bombed had they not just shot five guys touching each other for an hour and a half. Instead, Tag looks like it was partially shot as an action movie. Just replace the guns and fighting with...tag. With Jeremy Renner, you know your going to get the kind of stunt work that only makes the situation funnier and why he would be so hard to touch. Comedies need to exaggerate and this knows how to do so in the right places.While Tag does work for a while, I do unfortunately have to talk about the film's last act. Without spoiling anything, a character reveals themselves as dying, hence why he wanted to make this game of tag intense. While I appreciate trying to add more heart, it made the overall goal too easy, as standing up for a dying person is obvious. Wouldn't have made it more profound if it was all another trick, adding to the unpredictability of the group? I don't know if the real life subjects were faced with a similar dilemma, but if they did, I do feel for them.I'll give this eight tag hands out of ten. This made for a fun watch and a great reminder that the simplest and stupidest moments of friendship are the most cherished. So tag your friends and go see this,",Tag

57,AngelHonesty,Give and Take,7,20 January 2021,"The movie is a little off beat as it lacks in something, but it also gives a fun story to watch. I loved that the film is based from a true story, it makes it more interesting to watch to know that something like this happened in real life - adults playing tag. It's an easy going film that doesn't have any inappropriate moments, the scenes with Jerry are my favorite as their the funniest. But in all honesty the movie feels very lacking. It's too slow and simple at moments then it's suddenly almost over done. I strongly feel that the movie could have benefited from a different cast or better script. Ed Helms was extremely irritating the entire time, I loved him in The Hangover, but not in this movie. Lil Rel Howery's character Reggie was useless. He had such a small part that I kept asking why this guy was in the movie. It feels like they try to touch on character growth and such, but fail badly at it. I wish they would have solely focused on the funny parts of the film instead of trying to give it some depth. Overall you have to take the movie for face value. Something that's not deep or heavy and might make you laugh here and there, nothing more.",Tag
58,springfieldrental,Cute and witty is the Tagline,7,1 July 2018,"There are movies you just sit back and let it roll over you without thinking about expecting any deep social messages or the keys to humanity's perplexing question of metaphysical existence. ""Tag"" is such a movie.
 In real life, every February for 23 years a group of guys in Spokane, Washington, play tag amongst themselves. The Wall Street Journal, of all newspapers, got wind of the competition and the cat got out of the bag. Mark Steilen wrote a story based on the Spokane antics and delivers a solid comedy offering several very funny sequences. 
Although ""Tag"" won't be inducted to the Comedy Hall of Fame, the film is capably directed by Jeff Tomsic, who uses slo-mo effects to dissect some very quick-paced situations. And Josh Crockett's editing, with several very inventive invisible wipes, takes advantage of Tomsic's set-ups to keep the comedy springing forward. Not a bad way to spend a date-night.",Tag
59,kjproulx,Does It Really Work As A Movie?,7,16 June 2018,"There are times when a true story lends itself to a film in an emotionally resonant way and other times when it's simply done in order to impress or deliver laughs to an audience. That being said, Tag is a rare film that sort of relies on all of those things and more, which sort of makes for a weird experience at the movies. I have been looking forward to this film for a while and hearing that it was based on a true story made me that much more intrigued by it. Personally, I enjoyed my experience watching this film, but upon reflection, I can see why many viewers may find it boring or wish for it to be a much funnier romp. Here's why I would recommend Tag if you can check your expectations at the door and not expect it to be a hilarious movie from start to finish.Following a group of friends who have been playing the same game of tag for over thirty years, as a way of staying friends, they make it their mission to finally tag their friend Jerry, who has been the champion forever. Yes, the plot is silly and outlandish, as is the movie itself, but the fact that people are actually out there in the real world doing this, made for a much more subdued experience. At its core, this is a film about friendship and the comedic aspect of this film simply comes from whenever the writers decided to add jokes into the core premise of the movie. The emotional core is really what hooked me throughout this movie.It seems strange to say that the dramatic aspects of a movie that follows older men playing tag are the best portions of the film, but that's truly where I found myself most impacted by it. Yes, there are some very funny lines of dialogue that I'm still replaying in my head, but they are few and far between, making way for the third act, which isn't exactly the type of conclusion I was expecting. Without giving anything away (and if you don't know the way this true story ends), this film ends on a note that actually had me slightly tearing up. This truly is a movie about friendship, first and foremost. For that reason alone, I forgave the fact that it wasn't loaded with comedy.Now, that's precisely why I believe certain viewers will be turned off by this film. Most people will look at the trailers and think they're going to see a laugh riot, and like I said, there are jokes that work very well, but it's sort of a blend of both comedy and drama. If you're able to gravitate toward that throughout your viewing experience, then I can definitely say this is the movie for you. A good story always trumps good jokes in my opinion. A movie could have lame jokes, but if the core plot is holding it together, then it's not a complete flop in my opinion.Tag benefits from a very dedicated cast, with standouts being Hannibal Buress and Jake Johnson. These dedicated performers made this a very believable (albeit ridiculous) movie to watch. With some clever editing choices and quite frankly some cool choices in terms of cinematography, this movie tried to be much more than it needed to be, so I absolutely have to commend it for that. This is a comedy that you shouldn't be seeing for the comedy, but you'll still be rewarded with some hilarious moments. See this film for the camaraderie of friendship and I think you'll have a good time with it, as I did. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's a solid time at the movies.",Tag

61,msbreviews,Rating: B-,6,30 August 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I love when movies don't take themselves seriously enough and own how dumb they are. Honestly, this kind of films are usually the ones where I laugh the most, whether at the high levels of stupidity or at the nonsensical plot. In a comedy, if the director is able to accept that the premise is not exactly clever and plays with that, then for me it is an immediate success.Tag is not less not more than what I expected, which is precisely what I wished for. I already knew that the cast would be awesome, but they genuinely surprised me. The euphoric Ed Helms (Hoagie) is amazingly supported by some phenomenal performances from Jon Hamm (Bob Callahan), Jake Johnson (Chilli) and Hannibal Buress (Kevin Sable), even if Buress is a little below the others' level.However, I can't describe how hilariously badass Jeremy Renner (Jerry Pierce) is. I laughed so damn much at every single scene with him. From the incredible stunts (he broke his right arm and his left wrist during the first days of filming and kept going!) to the tremendously funny facial expressions, he is fabulous! I always enjoy his performances, and I do think he is a bit of an underrated actor in Hollywood, but he surprised me once more with his comedic talent.The girls are also very funny. Isla Fisher (Anna Malloy) and Annabelle Wallis (Rebecca Crosby) are the standouts, but I wished Jeff Tomsic used the talent of Rashida Jones (Cheryl Deakins) a bit more. However, Tomsic brilliantly directed the chasing scenes! They are extremely fun to watch, and the use of slow-motion is especially entertaining. Having Renner narrate what his character is thinking while escaping several attempts of a tag is surprisingly both impressive and amusing. It never gets annoying or excessive, I just can't get enough of it!Even the screenplay is well-written. I mean, clearly, this is not an Oscar masterpiece. It has its generic plot points and cliche characters, besides some lazy exposition moments. However, the way it is written easily captivates the audience, and each character's script is pretty funny. Even if it is based on a true story, sometimes they cross the line between ""yeah, I can accept that"" and ""nop, that's too stupid for my brain,"" due to the clear exaggeration of some scenes or to the way too dull dialogue.Inside the comedy genre, Tag is just another flick. It is no mind-blowing journey through laughter and snorting. Nevertheless, inside the sub-genre of ""silly comedies,"" it is definitely in the top half. The cast and the chasing scenes alone deserve that credit. That is actually one thing I wished they gave more time to, the actual game of ""tag"". There are loads of set pieces, but I still wanted more, since the subplots outside the game are not appealing at all.Tomsic demonstrates an excellent balance of tone and pacing. Tonally, it switches well between comedy and drama, even if during the third act it loses a bit of that control. However, the fast pacing helps smooth those minor issues out and keeps the high rhythm going. The editing is also pretty great throughout the runtime.Undoubtedly, Tag is a fantastic Sunday afternoon movie to watch with friends and family. It is hugely entertaining, and it has some awesome chasing scenes, which are sure to provide some hilarious moments. Wonderful performances from everyone, especially Ed Helms, Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner. Ignore some of the extreme silliness, and be sure to have fun with it because that is exactly what everyone involved with this film definitely had.",Tag
62,MrDHWong,An amusing farce anchored by the five likeable and funny lead actors,7,20 December 2018,"Tag is a comedy film starring Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, and Jeremy Renner. Based on the true story ""It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being It"" published by The Wall Street Journal, it is an amusing farce anchored by the five likeable and funny lead actors.Since they were nine years old, friends Hoagie (Ed Helms), Bob (Jon Hamm), Chilli (Jake Johnson), Kevin (Hannibal Buress), and Jerry (Jeremy Renner) have been playing an intense game of tag throughout the month of May. Despite now being fully grown men, the friends still continue their game no matter what obstacles are in their way. However, in the decades they have been playing, the only one of them who has never been ""It"" is Jerry, whose cunning and clever ways to avoid being tagged put him at odds with his four friends. Determined to tag Jerry once and for all, Hoagie, Bob, Chilli, and Kevin decide to unite and come up with a plan to get him back after all these years.High spirited and good natured, Tag thankfully extends beyond its one joke concept to become an entertaining comedy film that never bores its audience. Even if it were not based on a true story, the film still works just as well as a standard comedy film, even if it does get somewhat silly and non-sensical at times. All of the five leads had solid chemistry with each another and it is clear that they all had a blast filming this movie, in particular Jeremy Renner, who was incredibly fun to watch avoiding being tagged.I rate it 7/10",Tag
63,CANpatbuck3664,"Carried by a Talented Ensemble Cast, Funny Jokes and a Nice Message",8,4 July 2018,"Tag banks on the premise of this group of guys all playing a game of Tag that has lasted 20+ years. There isn't much of a story developed other than a couple of events to escalate (Jerry's wedding and potential retirement doesn't develop things, it only serves as a catalyst to throw the game into overdrive) and this is one of the few movies where I appreciated that. Tag is at its best when the characters are dropping one-liners at each other's expense or playing the game itself. Its when they try to bring in other elements to the story that Tag gets bogged down. The streamlining of the plot helped the movie operate at a quicker pace and I enjoyed that part of Tag.The action scenes in this movie are improbable and stretch plausibility. The scene in the woods encompasses this the best. But there is one standout aspect to them. Jeremy Renner's character of Jerry is a generational talent at the game of tag and he can anticipate the strategies and movements of his friends before they even happen. The scenes featuring Jerry are a sneaky satire of the Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes movies and even though I really dig those movies, the scenes were hysterical. They had a fun flow to them and despite the rest of the ensemble acting like goofballs to sell how awesome Renner's character is, they were some of the best parts of Tag.Tag brought together a mix of established comedians/comediennes and a few unexpected dramatic actors/actresses to cut loose. Ed Helms is playing a very Ed Helms character as Hogan, he's a little more animated than usual but he's a veteran and performs capably. The same goes for Jake Johnson as Randy 'Chilly' Chillano. I liked him here, he tends to be someone who needs good material to be effective, but he did his job. Jon Hamm seems like an odd choice (considering his age and his dramatic background) but it was also fun to see him do something unexpected in this. He also had his moments where he was just as funny as everyone else. My 2 favourites members of the cast were Hannibal Buress as Kevin Sable and Jeremy Renner as Jerry. Buress isn't stretching but his dialogue and his delivery were on point and he probably had me laughing the hardest out of anyone. Jeremy Renner also looked like he was having a blast cutting loose in this. He's usually very stern and low-key and he was great as this guy whose ability transcends this game. I also want to compliment Isla Fisher and Leslie Bibb as Anna Malloy and Susan Rollins respectively. They were both very funny in their own right (especially Isla) and it would be great to see them both take on more comedic projects like this. Tag has more than enough stuff to enjoy but it did have some problems that brought the movie down a little. Most of the subplots fall flat on their face. I couldn't have cared less about Annabelle Wallis' character Rebecca or the fact that she was covering this unusual story. Callahan and Chilly fighting over Cheryl (Rashida Jones) comes across as half-baked and felt like it should have been cut out of the movie. They gave Isla Fisher and Leslie Bibb great moments, I just wish Annabelle and Rashida could have some strong material to work with as well. I also thought the ending got a little melodramatic, I definitely liked where the movie was coming from emotionally but the drama surrounding Hogan felt tacked on and just out of left field (especially since the movie has no problem mocking chancy material throughout).Lastly, I liked the message/underlying theme that Tag is promoting. Whether you think a group of grown men playing tag is awesome or shockingly immature, the message of lasting friendship was heart warming. As the movie addresses, when you're young, you think you're going to have the same group of friends forever. This is almost never the case, but I liked the camaraderie this group had and I can see why someone looked at this story and was inspired by it.I got some big laughs out of Tag and that was enough to make it a worthwhile trip to the theatre. This won't be a transcendent comedy where I watch it regularly but I'm happy I took a chance on it. If you're looking for something to get a few belly laughs out of and don't mind seeing something a little on the immature side, give this a shot. My actual rating for Tag is 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10.",Tag

We're talking about an R-rated comedy that centers on a game of tag that's been going for 30 years. Yes, it is silly. Yes, it is over the top. That's the goal. And I chuckled a fair bit. It could have maybe been a bit shorter and found a better plot pace. Also, some characters did not really fit. So there were issues. But the idea works, and the main actors make it funny.

65,apryla-58795,Tag Me Out!,3,3 September 2018,This could have been a good movie. It had all the components for a good film...great story idea (based on a true story so no need to make stuff up) & a good cast. It was tailor made for success you would almost have to try to mess this up for it to not be a home run...but that's what they did. I laughed once during the film. John Hamm was out of place. They didn't even try to make him look any different than Don Draper. It's like he walked off the TV set onto the movie set and then tried to be funny but it didn't land. It was distracting because I kept thinking why is Don Draper trying to be Don Knotts. He looked like he was trying to belong but this just wasn't the right role for him.Jeremy Renner - why do they have to make him into a superhero in everyday normal films? He's getting to be one-note. I've never liked Isla Fisher. Ever since I saw her in Wedding Crashers my opinion hasn't changed - she's annoying just like her husband. It's like the two of them try to outdumb each other with their over the top acting roles. Wish Hollywood would stop giving them work. Ugh!Leslie Bibb must be in a three-way contest with Nicole Kidman & Gwen Stefani for whose face can split right down the middle first due to their skin being stretched so tight with injections. Pretty soon none of them will be able to close their mouths or their eyes. So distracting! They keep throwing Leslie Bibb in these dumb roles that would be better suited for younger bimbos. She's not young anymore it's just embarrassing. She tries so hard to be funny but all her roles are essentially the same - she has no range she is just window dressing with mean girl lines. Who even is Annabelle Wallis? They just threw her in this movie cause she's pretty. She added nothing! Running around scowling or rolling your eyes is not acting.Ed Helms is usually pretty funny but even he couldn't save this. Jake Johnson is really funny but again he couldn't save this either.Hannibal Buress might be funny in stand-up but he was just thrown in this movie to capitalize on his flavor of the month moment at the time this was made. What is with the mumbling?! It could have been anyone in that role. He added nothing.Nora Dunn-God! What the heck was she needed for?! The role was completely unnecessary. They could have used her salary to do more rewrites.Finally when you use miscarriage as a part of a joke-well these writers should be ashamed of themselves. What if some poor woman went to see this after having a miscarriage because her husband convinced her to go out for the night to get her mind off of it and then she sees that?! Not cool!And seriously-running around in a hospital?! There's no way that would have happened in a hospital.I knew within the first 15 minutes that my husband and I chose unwisely when we rented this film. I spent the remainder of the film hoping there would be something to redeem it but that never happened.Tag out on purpose and run away from this one.,Tag

Of course, Jerry's upcoming wedding is the perfect opportunity for his friends - Hoagie (Ed Helms), Reggie (Lil Rel Howery), Bob (Jon Hamm) and Chilli (Jake Johnson) - to plot their attack to finally take him down. All of this being documented by Wall Street Journal reporter Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis). Sure, it sounds insane, but when you find out this was actually based on a true story, it sort of blows your mind.Despite the interesting concept, 'Tag' stumbles on execution. It feels unoriginal and follows a cookie cutter script. The dialogue is lazy and trite. The stylized, slo-mo action scenes are a decade or two late, and even minor roles for Rashida Jones as Cheryl Deakins and Isla Fisher as the intense tag-playing co-conspirator and wife of Hoagie don't do enough to improve things.'Tag' is another example of why we need a revival in adult comedies, rather than settling for the same old retreads.",Tag

The premise lends itself to a lot of easy humor but the laughs are multi-layered and hit at many a level: The sight of grown adults shocking bystanders with such abormal devotion to a childish game (the camera makes sure to pan to these shots), the Isla Fisher character who regularly ups her intensity to maniacal at her husband's progress, and the physical comedy all hit.Similar to another Ed Helms film ""The Hangover"", there's a lot of escalating tension. Will the bad guy be tagged? Will people be seriously maimed or killed before the end of the film?

81,jayjaycee,"Men don't grow up, they only age",6,8 June 2020,"""Tag"" is a 2018 comedy directed by Jeff Tomsic starring Jeremy Renner and Ed Helms. After almost an hour of desperately attempting to find a film for the evening in our own shelves, my brother and I decided to relocate the search the the virtual video store that Netflix is. Even though it still took some time to decide on what genre to go through, we finally settled for this comedy we coincidentally found in the respective category. It was clear from the beginning that is wasn't going to be outstanding amusement, but from time to time, it is also necessary to check out this type of movies. This film definitely served its purpose and delighted me mildly. It was truly surprising to see that plot is based on true events and the shenanigans of some childhood friends, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was indeed possible to be true. This whole motion picture is the proof for the theory that men really don't grow up and instead remain kids in bodies of adults, with their toys and possibilities growing with them accordingly. As depicted in here, you got a group of childhood friends in their early/mid forties who lead the innocent game of tag ad absurdum. Once a year, in the month of May, they set out to continue the game they started almost thirty years ago and make it some sort of competition, no matter what has happened since then. One is a successful veterinarian, another is the fruitful CEO of a huge company, the third is still the same stoner he used to be as a teenager and the last of them suffers from paranoia and persecutory delusion, and yet they annually meet and enjoy their seemingly everlasting friendship. They couldn't be anymore different to each other and yet they come back to their childish game and relive their good old days, and as depicted in this movie, ally one last time to finally catch their mutual friend who has never been tagged once in the whole three decades, before he retires in the course of his wedding. That is the basic concept of this flick and as already expected, it is nothing but cheap fun. First, the actors casted in fact managed to convey that they are from entirely different walks of life, but I really don't buy from them that they share a deep friendship that persists to the present day. Aside from the fact that Jake Johnson, commonly known as the guy from ""New Girl"", is noticeably younger than his co-stars, the overall chemistry between all of them is anything but harmonious. Ed Helms is mediocrely funny, just as his always Stuart Price resembling performances allow him to be, Johnson plays the stereotypical stoner/loser who easily could have been portrayed by Seth Rogen, and Howery delivers some actually hilarious lines as the mainly objective bystander. While the three at least display a little bit of connection to each other, Hamm and Renner are wholly out of place in this constellation. To be honest, I previously have seen the ""Mad Men"" star in more or less serious roles (""The Town"", ""Baby Driver"") and hence it felt enormously weird to see him star in such an infantile flick alongside mediocre comedy actors. The same applies to Hawkeye Renner who is rather known as an MCU and action film actor and not a comedy actor. It is anything but terrible when artists want to explore new territory, but in case of the two it shows that some people are not made for certain genres. Even if the character constellation is more weird than convincing and lacks any form of chemistry, the plot at least offers a few hilarious ideas that make it at least a bit entertaining. The fact that Renner's Jeff is still the undefeated champion of this silly game creates the comedic momentum of the film. What once has been a tomfoolery of boys has turned into a serious competition over the years and hence the stunts, chicanery and measures became more extreme accordingly. Next to setting up traps in forest area that easily could have been used to defeat the Predator, attempted waterboarding of close-lipped gym employees and faking a miscarriage nothing is left untried. Pleasantly, the film doesn't try to be funny by delivering one ""funny"" joke and snappy punchline after another, the humour lies in the ludicrous nature of the film and the absurd concept it underlies. Also the bizarrely analytic thinking of Renner's character, the way he extensively plans his next actions in his mind while everything around him seems to move in slow motion doesn't only make him appear to be some sort of superhuman with beyond nature abilities, it also adds a lot to the ridiculousness. Even the unexpectedly sad turn in the end of the film played a major role in the whole concept, as it eventually binds together the unconnected characters and conveys the important message that one is never too old to have fun with friends. All in all, this flick might not be the funniest in terms of comedy gold, as the characters lack any chemistry between each other and the jokes are mostly delivered through the actions, but it still has got a lot of heart and bares an important meaning that we all should take to our hearts: We are never too mature to find joy in silly things. That is what I give this film credit for.",Tag

For one month every year, five highly competitive friends organize no-holds-barred game of tag they've been playing forever - risking their necks, jobs and relationships to take each other down with the battle cry ""You're It!""This time, the game coincides with the wedding of the gang's only undefeated player, which should finally make him an easy target...Starring Ed Helms, Jeremy Renner, John Hamm, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Isla Fisher, Leslie Bibb, Rashida Jones, Annabelle Wallis et al.I mentioned all these people that may be hard to remember just by name, because ""Tag"" comedy is essentially a team comedy, an effort where the success depends very much on the flow and synergy between actors.The good news is, since they're all professionals who do this kind of thing all the time, there's no trouble here. Basics are solid.Even the best-known names, such as Helms, Hamm (of ""Mad Men"" fame), or Renner are here for the team, nobody's in star position.Except maybe Helms, a versatile comedian offering his usual mix of sweet, sensitive and funny. The problem with him is that he does the same thing all the time, so any movie will feel a bit more generic just by having him.But it's not just all comedy. ""Tag"" is also kind of an action movie, although in unusual way. There is only little amount of actual, you know, action, although the handbag fight is a standout part.But the clever use of slow motion gives the scenes of grown-ups playing tag a distinct feel of an action movie, with all the amateur parkour and dangerous stunts to get away from being tagged. Nicely done.For an R-rated adult comedy, ""Tag"" is also refreshingly obscenity-free. There's only character who has a bit of a foul mouth (a female, by the way) and the amount of dirty jokes is less than average.We still have a constantly pot-smoking character but no modern comedy would be complete without drug-jokes.In summary, ""Tag"" is more about atmosphere and flow than heavy on laugh out loud moments. You may not remember it that well in couple of day's time but it's breezy fun while it lasts.For a bit of escapist entertainment released during summer season, I've seen a lot worse.",Tag
86,WalkdenEntertainment,"Your it, No Your it, Na Your it, Nope Your It!",6,16 November 2018,"A group of 5 friends start a yearly game of TAG when they are just young boys in school. The rules of the game are simple- only the 5 boys are allowed to play (no one else!) and the game starts and ends during the month of May. Whoever is IT at the end of May has to wait for the game to resume the next year in May again.Fast forward 30 years later to the present day and the boys are now grown up adults who are still playing the game once a year for the full month of May. It's also the one time of the year that brings the original guys back together so they don't lose touch with one another.To make the film more interesting and humorous, one of the 5 leading players, Jerry (played by Jeremy Renner), has been impossible to tag because he's just too damn good at the game. This year, defeat is not an option and the 4 men will team up together to try and TAG one man.Those who are unaware, this film is fact based on true events of a group of men who not only still play TAG, but go great distances in order to try and tag the other players. The lengths they will go to include dressing up completely so the other players are not aware of their presence, or sometimes sneaking into the boot of someone's car and so on.I was rather curious, as the film's concept is different to anything we have seen previous seen in a comedy.While the idea is good, the film's end result can be rather average, and at time our jokes can feel repetitive. Sometimes it feels like the same scene is repeated, with our main characters setting up a situation in order to try and catch Jeremy Renner's character.Jeremy Renner does manage to bring many good jokes to the film, including us hearing his inner monologue in action moments, just like Robert Downy Jr in Sherlock Holmes.The film also introduces a few side plots which don't always get full resolution. One example is watching a couple of the guys both trying to win the affection of one woman. This side story has no real point and never feels complete or resolved.On a positive note, I truly love the comedy cast and line up. Jerry (Jeremy Renner), Callahan (Jon Hamm), Randy (Jake Johnson), Sable (Hannibal Buress) and Hoagie (Ed Helms) are excellent, and one my favourite crazy stars in this film is Hoagie's wife, played by Isla Fisher.Overall, Tag is a comedy I would recommend to Finesse Fans if you want to watch a brainless comedy.

Five friends decide early in their childhood to never stop playing, that way they would never really get old in spirit, so they continue to play their favorite game, tag, which has persisted over the course of thirty years, but only during the month of may each year; but the real point of the film involves one of these friends, Jerry (Jeremy Renner) who has never been tagged and has the perfect record. The four remaining friends hope to catch him this time because Jerry gets married and they believe it would be a perfect opportunity to do it. The movie contains some impressive slow-motion action sequences which are charged with comedic insights about what the Jerry character is thinking (à la Sherlock Holmes). The rest of the cast does a great job, Ed Helms, Jon Hamm, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress and Isla Fisher (every scene where she yells and acts overly excited is particularly funny).So, don't dismiss this movie because of its silly plot, although it says that is based on true events.

But it's been a while since that wheezy old trope has been executed as perfectly as it is in Tag - my frontrunner for the funniest movie of the year so far.Based on a true story (as hard as it might be to believe), this hilarious and heartwarming tale revolves around a group of childhood best friends who refuse to let the responsibilities and disappointments of adulthood kill off their inner 9-year-olds. Every year, for one month, these five middle-aged merry pranksters (Jeremy Renner, Ed Helms, Jon Hamm, Jake Johnson, and Hannibal Buress) play tag - that classic ""You're it!"" playground pastime whose rules couldn't be more simple. Of course, they've added their own arcane bylaws and codicils to the game over the years, including tagging players at the most inopportune times in the most unexpected places, such as the hospital delivery room during the births of their children and the funerals of their parents. It's a cross-country full-contact blood sport. To them, tag has become more than just a stupid game. It's a lifeline to a more innocent, carefree time.When asked by everyone they meet why they do this - why they keep playing this kids' game after all these years - the guys keep repeating, ""We don't stop playing because we get old; we get old because we stop playing."" You get the sense they've said this mantra of an excuse so many times that they know how corny and hollow it sounds. But the magic of Tag is that it winds up being absolutely true. It's a ridiculously raunchy and very, very sweet comedy about staying connected to the most important people in your life. The people who know everything about you and what makes you tick - even the things you'd rather they didn't. It's about being vulnerable and accepted unconditionally. This silly game about getting away from one another, deep down, is about staying close and getting closer.",Tag

Even being a Jake Johnson fan boy, this movie just didn't do it for me. I felt it missed a lot of opportunities for some great comedy and went for a weird touchy-feely thing that just didn't belong with the dick jokes.

96,Jared_Andrews,Tag is Flawed but still Fun,6,19 June 2018,"If you seek a fun and funny summer movie, look no further than Tag. Well, as long as you're okay with a movie that possesses zero lasting impact, little substance, and moral, umm, compromises. Five male friends have been playing the same game of tag for over 30 years, even as they have each moved on to different cities and their adult lives. Each month of May the game resumes and the taggers take great lengths to avoid being ""it."" Despite the best efforts of the other four, Jerry (Jeremy Renner) has never been tagged. Not once. In 30 years. Hoagie (Ed Helms) informs the guys that Jerry is retiring from the game, so this must be the year that they finally tag him. To get things started, Hoagie sets off on one of the best ""getting the gang together"" movie sequences I've seen in several years. Of course, Jerry hasn't remained untagged all these years for no reason. When approached, he unveils his heightened senses and powers of observation via internal monologues that the film captures surprisingly well. Renner's escape sequences truly make him look like a superhero. Actually, his character in this movie is more impressive than his Hawkeye character in Avengers. This movie is jampacked with action, much of it intentionally over-the-top. The taggers are intense, even diabolical. Taking this too seriously could have been disastrous, but fortunately the film is self-aware. It never passes up an opportunity to poke fun at itself. Each chase scene makes the taggers appear both heroic and appropriately ridiculous. In another indication of the film's self-awareness, the filmmakers make clear that the game is more than a game. Unfortunately, they deliver this message in a tactless way. A character literally utters the words, ""It's not just about playing tag. The game keeps us together."" The line is a bit too blunt, but it's understandable. Subtlety isn't exactly this movie's strong suit. The film also understands when to deliver a dose of comic relief as things become too intense. Hannibal Buress does most of the heavy lifting in that department. Despite the movie's frenetic action and breezy pacing, it drags. Even a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes felt too long. Overall, Tag is inconsistent. It has its funny and tender moments but nothing that will stick with viewers for long. To its credit, the cast and gags make for a fleeting night of fun. For some, that may be enough.",Tag
97,MickeyTheConstant,Poor,3,10 January 2021,Other than a couple of funny moments (bum scene and granny scene) this was very poor. Renner was good in his role making fun of himself quite a bit. Many times during the movie I was bored. There was also one scene towards the end that was incredibly bad taste and how the creators signed it off I don't know. Mocking miscarriage is a terrible idea. How many people going through a bad time with pregnancy who may have watched this movie to try and have a bit of fun and escape for a few hours would have had to sit through that. People that have gone through such bad experiences would have been reminded of it all. I know these movies are never going to be 100% PC but this use of humour was awful. Shame on everyone involved.,Tag
98,scb_coldsteel,Lots of talent went into a movie that turned out not funny in the least.,4,15 January 2019,"I finally watched the movie Tag on DVD. The previews looked pretty funny and I was in the mood for a comedy. Unfortunately there was nothing quite funny about this movie in any regard.The premise of the movie follows a group of friends who have been playing a near non-stop game of tag. As the movie progresses they find themselves in more and more elaborate situations playing tag all the while coming to terms with growing up and with life and its many struggles. Wacky shenanigans ensue and the film ends with an obligatory montage of best friends playing tag.It's not exactly a well-written film in any regard. All the characters in the film were one-dimensional and lacked any sense of humor or timing. The jokes were a mix of unfunny juvenile jokes and simply bad ones. The film never found its comedic voice at all.So I found the premise to be ridiculous, but I still had hope based upon the cast. To put it simply no one is funny in this entire film. There isn't a funny situation or comical line that made me even chuckle. I don't care that this is based around a true story, it simply was not a well-made film or compelling story.The actors could not save this film and the horrendous material they are forced to deliver. Which is an absolute shame because I like the entire cast. It takes a lot of skill to put this much talent into a movie and have it bomb so horribly. There were however moments where I enjoyed the chemistry between the cast and there were also a few familiar plot points for those of us who've had friends we remained close to since adolescence. You can tell they really wanted this movie to have a deep emotional meaning, particularly in the final arc, it just doesn't.The film plays towards the lowest common denominator, but still isn't funny in the least. I don't mind a stupid comedy if it can embrace its silliness and make you laugh. However there's just nothing in this film that is very funny.There is nothing that I can really say I enjoyed about this movie. Comedy unfortunately has struggled substantially over the years. This is a great example of how not to make a comedy. Nothing in this movie particularly works well. It is not even a case of it's so bad it's worth watching, it's simply not worth watching.

104,snowfre,"When you're done watching it, you'll forget it immediately",5,24 March 2020,"Jeff Tomsic's comedy film ""Tag"" is based on one of those cute real-life stories that has made internet go ""Aaaaaw"". It follows a group of adults who has never stopped playing tag, and four of them (Helms, Hamm, Johnson, and Buress) get together to take down the fifth group member, the all-time tag champion, Jerry (Renner). With the support of a few other actors, who the cast makes a good delivery of the film's jokes. At times, ""Tag"" is really funny, but during the 100 minutes running length, they are quite sparse. I think the writers had the opportunity to create a nostalgic feel good movie with additional tagging action, but they settled with a typical buddy comedy that simply isn't beneficial for the film's plot. Watching adult men playing tag with an all-in commitment isn't necessarily awkward, but to say the least, very uninteresting. Once again, there's nothing wrong with the cast, even though no one makes the role of their lives, but ""Tag"" ends up rather uninteresting despite its funniest, action packed moments.",Tag

107,bastille-852-731547,Amusing (but only sporadically funny) R-rated Laughs,6,15 June 2018,"Few studio comedies have a premise as ludicrous at first glance than ""Tag,"" which centers on a group of 40-something men playing the playground game of tag for a month every year. They play the game with absolutely no holds barred, and the best player in the group (who has never been tagged,) is about to marry.The cast in this film is generally quite strong throughout. I'm a fan of much of the ensemble, which was the primary reason I took interest in this comedy. The chemistry between the leading men is strong, and the female roles are also enjoyable to watch while adding narrative tissue to the film. It's certainly enjoyable and entertaining to see such a talented cast just have fun with each other. The plot is generally amusing, and the slapstick ""action"" sequences as players avoid being tagged are fairly creative and fun to watch. That said, the film does have some very notable flaws which bring it down a notch compared to similar mainstream comedy films.The first key flaw with the movie is the clear and present lack of conflict, since the characters agree to a book of rules for the game--so even though players can be afraid of being tagged, there's a pretty drastic lack of suspense or even a sense of thrill in these moments at times. The writing is fine and there are some good jokes, but plenty of them don't work. Much of the humor tends to come from the absurdity of the situations in the game rather than any written plot devices. Also, the movie seems to (maybe unintentionally?) send a mixed message about the friends' game of tag. It means to be a silly comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, and also wants to portray the friend group as tight knit. Then again, it also portrays the game of tag as something that does have clear negative consequences--albeit to a fleeting and finite extent. Of course the movie is intended to be over-the-top, but even in far-fetched scenarios like this, there is a psychological limit to just how long the viewer can suspend their disbelief. That doesn't mean they won't have some fun watching it, but it means that the movie's concept could have been executed slightly better.If you are a fan of someone in the cast, I liked ""Tag"" just enough to recommend that you see it, but others can probably just wait to rent it. 6/10",Tag
108,iguth,It is TV humor,6,27 April 2019,"Tag is a movie that reminds me of Daddy's Home. It is a comedy featuring some honestly good actors but it is pretty meh. The concept is actually quite fun; the idea of having a game of tag for years into adulthood is cool. The movie however really truly is just a dumb humor kind of movie where our main characters go through some sort of wacky adventure in this case being a game of tag. Past a game of tag there really aren't any theatrical ups to this movie. The movie itself relies solely on the funny writing along with the natural humorous nature of the cast in order to make the film compelling. While the cast is strong and the writing is okay, those two things alone cannot create a very high quality movie.",Tag

113,domtaylor,You're it.,7,8 July 2018,"Although it's only occasionally funny, 'Tag' manages to be a constantly entertaining experience that uses its unique storyline to offer audiences a comedy that feels fresh. While the joke structure and general feel of the film is similar to the majority of comedies from recent years, the situations that the characters find themselves in in order to 'tag' each other offer something original. The majority of characters are well-realised, and all bring a different comedic aspect to the picture. The only character that I didn't like was Annabelle Wallis' 'Rebecca Crosby'. While it has nothing to do with Wallis' performance, the character has no real purpose except for being the person who all the exposition is dumped on. The character is a reporter who likes the idea of what these men are doing and decides to go on their 'tagging' quest with them. Throughout the film all she does is follow the characters around asking questions about their pasts, the rules and regulations of their 'tag' game, and even about events that had literally just taken place onscreen. Personally, I feel like this character should not have been included in the film, as much of the 'required' exposition could have been delivered through the main characters- or perhaps a one-scene side character who was confused as to what the characters were doing (although it's pretty clear due to the visuals)- and not through a reporter who's role in the film is a rather unbelievable one. Apart from the inclusion of that character and the exposition, the film flies along at a rapid pace, always being entertaining. It might not be a laugh-out-loud comedy that breaks the mould, but its characters and fun situations are good enough to keep you entertained for 100 minutes. 7/10.",Tag

However, it is the ""Adults Only"" type of Comedy Flick",8,14 June 2018,"I have always enjoyed comedy movies, that is why I ""loved"" watching ""Tag"". The fact that really surprised me, is that the story of this movie is inspired from real life events of some people that actually exist in this world. Knowing this fact made me laugh even more as I viewed this fun-infused movie. The basic plot of ""Tag"" revolves around a group of friends, who have been playing the game of tag from childhood to adulthood, and are still continuing with it.Their ""game-of-tag champion"" is known as Jerry (Jeremy Renner). The others plan on taking the champ's title away from him before he ""officially"" announces his retirement from the game after his well-planned wedding ceremony.I have to congratulate the ensemble cast for all their excellent performances in this laugh-riot picture. Watching these adult-actors play the children's game of tag is ""funny to the power of infinity"". At the same time, it teaches us (adults) that it is vital for everyone to keep the child alive inside us - even if it is at a minimum level, and just in one tiny part of our daily lives.The director has done a marvelous job in making ""Tag"" a fresh-comedy experience for viewers.

I loves how it escalates, and everything becomes bigger and bigger. The feeling of urgency and the stakes are there with Jeremy Renner's character retirement. The conflict is non-stop and the pace is mostly fast and consistent. The action sequences understand its tone and are as absurd as they are thrilling and fun. On the other hand, I feel the third act is not as strong as the other two. It lacks a climax scene, a final showdown. Sure, we get Ed Helms trying to tackle Jeremy Renner on his wedding, but it lasts just a few seconds.

Not every joke lands but nothing made me groan and the film was constant enough to keep a smile on my face throughout.The concept is explored very well with some brilliant psychical humour and absurd set pieces and despite falling into a small handful of expected cliches the screen play feels fresh and different.I might have given this a better score if I hadn't just seen the surprising similar film Game Night this year but this does stand on it's own.

135,Ingrouille181,"A film I've been curious about for a while, but didn't need to watch",4,8 July 2018,"I can at least say I'm interested when a production company puts together a film like this; earlier this year we had Truth and Dare, a horror about the Truth or Dare game. And now we have a comedy, about a 30 year game of tag between friends which is apparently based on a true story. I really didn't feel interested enough to see this film, but it had a great cast of actors in it, so either they saw something in the script about it that appealed heavily to them, or they did it for a quick pay check; I'm thinking it was the second one.The story of course focuses on a group of 5 friends, all of whom have been playing the same game of tag with each other for 30 years. One year however, four have decided to group in order to finally tag the last of the five; the one who has never been tagged, before he weds and ends the game for good. Ed Helms, Jon Hamm, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress do their job, as well as the supporting cast including Isla Fisher and Annabelle Wallis; they all work off each other, but other than that I have no other opinions of them in this. Jeremy Renner on the other hand was the perfect level of over the top CIA, government trained badass this kinda movie needs. My main problems lie in how the story tries to span its runtime. It just feels overly seriously in large parts, and I just would've preferred if it knew what kinda film it was, more. This movie should've just been like The Disaster Artist, just be as accurate to real life as possible, at least we would get into it more. Overall it's a safe, by the numbers comedy, and I for one am glad that we have a film about tag, but honestly I'm glad this films exists so we can get it out of the way.

The game is played one month a year and one of the members Jerry (the only member who has never been tagged) is planning to retire motivating the men to tag him once and for all. This film was funny and totally star studded. The acting was great and the comedy was at its best. Yes, I felt the film was a bit mediocre but it definitely worth the watch. The film is enjoyable and heart warming with action, comedy, and a classic movie twist. I was very hyped for the film and was not much disappointed with the film. I definitely recommend for those who have not yet heard of the ""Tag"" brothers.""Some couples go on cruises. Some couples go camping. Some couple go to strip clubs and have gang bangs. And this is just what we love, this is our gang bang.""

146,sarajimi,feels like two different movies,6,14 March 2019,"Tag had some really funny parts that were offset by the crassness, which ironically pops up the most in the non-action sequences. The action sequences were (in my opinion) well done, humorous, and on a better level than the rest of the ""humor"" in the movie; just the concept that someone would go so far to win a game of tag is funny in itself. in between action scenes, however, it was as if the writers had no clue how to maintain the flow without resorting to locker-room dialogue. they also seemed uncertain how to handle topics with emotional depth, skating across the discovery of one character's alcoholism (although they attempt to broach it at least twice) and the sense of separation/alienation the same character feels from the rest. but they still find time for a full minute of pointless conversation about sucking dicks and a drawn out interaction of one of their's moms coming onto one of the friends, among other misstarts.
if the movie had been all entirely along the lines of the chase/action scenes, I would've given it an 8. if it had been entirely the in-between stuff, I wouldn't have finished it and given it a 1 (since so few ratings sites, not just imdb, don't allow zeroes).",Tag

148,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Lackluster and not worth your time,4,29 June 2018,"A movie where they put all of their money into the actors and were left trying to fill in the missing pieces. The direction wasn't up to par and the plot really just was lacking. Sure you had some ""twists"" but they were either unbelievable or just not what you wanted to see.
They brought together a great cast with a mix of perennial stars and newcomers that would be able to build off of one another as just a strange group of friends. But the pacing was off, the lines were awkward, and for a comedy based on the game of tag there wasn't much room for it to not be funny, because tag can't really be built up that dramatically. Lil Rel Howery was really the only one that capitalized in the comedy category. Jake Johnson was an utter disappointment who really didn't contribute if anything he got in the way. Then Ed Helms and Jon Hamm were just present for the plot and weren't anything special.
Trying to break into blockbusters, Jeff Tomsic did not give himself any help. This movie will need to be swept under the rug to continue on in his career. He also didn't have much help from the writers. Who tried there best to produce comedic lines, but were stuck on the sidelines with random one liners and bloopers that couldn't carry a full-length film",Tag

I didn't expect anything mind blowing, just a film with some laughs. And generally, that's what I got. There isn't much to the characters, and the plot is thin, but the laughs are there. I like the main cast members, so that's what drew me to this feature, that and wanting to laugh. I feel like Hannibal Buress and Jon Hamm are particularly good comedians, and handle their roles well. Annabelle Wallis was an odd choice for her role, and doesn't really have much to do, but is there through much of the film. She's pretty, but there's no reason they couldn't have cast an American in the role instead of a Brit playing American. In general though, I think the male cast is spot on with their antics, and this isn't a bad way to spend an hour and a half. 6/10",Tag

Seemingly they all have nothing else in their lives, characters are one dimensional which would normally do in a film with leading characters to make the rest of the film. All we have here is five supporting actors, no lead, no direction. Poor writing in that it has a sequences, but no dialogue of any merit. 
This is what happens when you get bankable comedy actors, and a reasonable budget and make a film thinking that's all you need. 
It surprises me this has a total of six points by people who give it nines, I means SERIOUSLY! You think films don't get much better than this? You leave yourself only one point to place all the better films you will ever see in your life?

I liked it a decent amount, it was better than I expected.The performances are great. The veteran cast take the weight of the story on their shoulders and pull off quite a bit. Their chemistry is flawed; you really feel like you know these people and they've known each other for so long. All of the guys played their parts well. Jeremy Renner in particular had quite the opportunity to show off his comedic chops. Ilsa Fisher, however, is the standout, playing her perfect role as a maniacal wife. A1.The writing was sub-par. An over exaggerated story and funnily written scenarios with a sweet center help bolster the writing above an uneven plot.The direction was good. It's comedic action that really fits. Might be the standout of the movie. There are a few particular segments that really stand out.One other aspect that stood out was the choreography for the fighting.

Not much to report here except they are all fine. The script is pretty... loose. Its clear that the ""based on true events"" part is stretching it. However, they managed to make it enjoyable. The comedy is where this will be hit or miss for you. There are several raunchy, over-the-top gags that I imagine wont sit well with older people, children, or those who dont like dirty and screwed up humor.

It's weakness is it's lack of emotional weight , most of which comes in the last moment and feels almost forced. Characters don't seem to learn the important lessons that seem to be seeded throughout the film and instead are just used as punch lines. Just some of the character arcs that really go no where are : a jobless stoner with no ambition, a corporate big wig who is self absorbed, a seemingly perfect man who's actually an alcoholic, a man fearful that his wife is cheating on him and a reporter bored with work . None of this matters as the movie heads to its end. it does try to become Something more and it sure is fun when those moments happen , it's just to little and way to late in to help it rise to greatness .",Tag
168,chasemykleby,"""Tag"" is a very fun movie and it captures what it feels like to be a kid again.",7,9 March 2019,"Review for ""Tag""
(7/10)""Tag"" is a very fun movie and it captures what it feels like to be a kid again, playing a fun ""little"" game of tag. You probably know by now that Tag is based on a true story. When they were nine-years-old, a group of tight-knit friends created a game of tag that they played for the duration of the month of May. Every year, for thirty years, it continued, regardless of where they were or what they were doing. That didn't change until one of the group, who had never been tagged, is believed to be about to quit. Now, the game is on more than ever.
The ensemble cast boasts Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson and Hannibal Buress as the taggers alongside Isla Fisher, Leslie Bibb, and Rashida Jones. For his first movie directing job, Jeff Tomsic, effortlessly and stylishly choreographs. The cast is great, and Renner really gets to show off his comedy and action acting abilities.
A major reason for Tag succeeding is that the script is on point. It doesn't feel forced and it doesn't feel like it is merely a series of tropes or clichés even though it plays with many of them. What you end up with is a movie that nestles nicely between familiar and fresh. If anything, I'd have liked to have seen Tag really earn its R-rating and go a bit harder. While there are a few moments that are close to the bone, I think it could have taken the whole thing a bit further. Regardless, it's worth checking out.
Tag isn't a comedy classic but it's certainly entertaining and delivers what it promises along with a few welcome surprises. As a whole, it's never anything less than entertaining with some nicely twisted touches.",Tag

It makes you laugh and have fun, but it also delivers a message I couldn't agree more with: ""we don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing"" ... or something like that. You see negative reviews for this movie (bar the obviously paid 1 ratings of some idiots who didn't even watch it) exactly because many people grow old prematurely: they get obsessed with their jobs, with making money they can't enjoy until they get old and incapable of enjoying things anymore, with living for others and not themselves or giving up on their way of life for what others tell them it's 'appropriate'. The fact that this movie is loosely based on a real story makes it even more enjoyable and fun - apparently, there's still hope for people in the world and I can only guess how fun it would be to be one of them, hahaha!Back to the actual movie, it is filled with quality humour, but also some crude humour that prematurely old parents would tell you it's not 'safe' for kids - forget that nonsense, kids will love it too, it's not like they don't do it between themselves anyway. The movie strikes the right balance between delivering an accurate and positive message of enjoying life (despite the social conventions that tell you not to) and not taking itself too seriously, while also expertly and subtly poking fun at some of the nowadays social obsessions (e.g. the 'fake' hysteria, the media's reputation, and so on) for very brief moments during its playtime. It's also quite packed with 'action' and doesn't let you get bored for a second, all within the context of the competitive nature of the game.Normally, this would have been a solid 8, but I raised it to 9 as its message is perfectly suited for my taste (as I mentioned above) and to 10 because I couldn't believe that even for a comedy like this there are losers that can rate it 1 star ... without even seeing it.

The ""what?"" punchline was used excessively and the ending was very predictable. However I did laugh now and then, great cast (still a bit shaky on Annabelle Wallis) and is just entertaining for the hour and 40 minutes run time. The directing and cinematography was decent. And some of the slow mo Sherlock esk scenes were quite well done. Overall, this film isn't bad.

It's refreshing to see their still is the ability to make a good comedy these days without TOO overloading it with sex and drug humor. Granted their was some of that in the film, but it wasn't the focus or over done. Though a lot of people would say it's too much.The writing was wonderful, with the jokes and interactions between the characters being engaging and funny.

But that doesn't mean that it's not enjoyable for what it truly is. Watching Tag might be compared to taking a cruise through the Bahamas. There isn't anything particularly unique, aside from the true story that inspired the film, but it's a pleasant experience and in the end, maybe you'll wish that cruise lasted just a little longer. Tag has just about everything packed into a friendly and amusing character development story about friendship. It's lighthearted drama with some action and humor sprinkled on top. For this, I applaud the effort to not over-sensationalize the script any more than it did. It actually did end exactly where it needed to. What you take from it depends on what you bring to it.",Tag
218,sjbradford,"Interesting idea, but too thin to sustain a movie",4,31 December 2018,"This movie was based on an newspaper article about childhood friends continuing a game of tag into adulthood. Fun idea, but not nearly enough to sustain a 100 minute movie. So they try to stuff in a bunch of other stuff, including a romantic subplot, and cancer. That's right, cancer - a well known comedy killer.It doesn't help that the cast is populated by second-tier TV actors. Ed Helms is not a movie star; stop trying to make him happen. Neither is Jake Johnson. I can't understand how Jeremy Renner made it - he's a very dull screen presence and not good looking at all (by movie standards).The two saving graces of this movie: Jon Hamm and Isla Fisher. Hamm does his usual charming cad routine, but he does it so well. And Fisher is a riot, doing a lot with very little material. Why isn't she a bigger star?",Tag

It's so worth your time and money if you just want a good laugh, what more can you expect from adults not able to tag their friend for 30 years?My small little complaint/nitpick is having Chilli and Bob have a crush on the same girl, and fight over her.

236,charlie-krausse,Tag - You're It!,8,15 June 2018,"Tag, you're it! And thus the game has begun and the plot has been defined! For 30 years a group of best friends every May continued this time honored childhood tradition of who was it! Of course, amendments to their by-laws occur, and yes, they do have written by-laws. Pages of them. All with the same common goal, tag Jerry.Hogan (Helms), Callahan (Hamm), Chilli (Johnson), Sable (Buress) are the childhood friends who were never able to tag the elusive Jerry (Renner). Ever. Throughout the film they go through great lengths to both tag and avoid tag from each other. Either by dumb luck or happenstance, USA Today stumbled across this game (in real life) and thus the story was born. From there, ESPN had a 30 for 30 about the group of friends. From there, it has evolved to a major motion picture.The lengths the guys go to, to be both not tagged and to tag seem far fetched, but 1) they guys and that's not the dumbest thing guys have done when together and 2) like every other movie based on a real life story, it shows footage of the actual game throughout the years, proving their idiotic behavior and yes, awesomeness. An argument can be made for who is the favorite male in the movie but Isla Fisher wins that award on the female side. Foul-mouthed and clearly the most competitive, even though not part of the original team, she assists throughout the movie in her own dynamic way.This movie makes the audience remissness about their childhood friends and stupid traditions.

241,jaka6052,"""Look at me I'm funny""",2,26 August 2018,"The movie has a catchy setup. The trailer already predicted some of the major flaws but i gave it a go anyway. In short: I do not recommend to watch it. The main issue I had with the movie are the poorly developed characters. The main characters are acting so irrational that it makes it hard not to get annoyed. The side characters are also completely misplaced. I know they had to add the Wallstreet Journal Girl because of the newspaper article, but does she really add something to the movie? Then the wife with the temper issue. Maybe funny in theory but it was so over the top that it was simply dull. Same goes with the stoner. Ok i get it, its fun to have a lowlife weed smoking dude in the movie, but then please do it right (also no CGI smoke please it looks like adobe after effects trial pack). This movie feels like its constantly screaming at me ""look! we are funny!"". A little example: why do this meticulous fight scenes work for Robert Downey Jr. in Sherlock Holmes but not in this movie? Because it doesn't fit the character development at all. Jerry ""the untagged"" is not some mastermind, hes just a regular guy! And thats ok! The essence of the movie is that 5 guys just play this since 30 years, this idea is so much fun, it doesn't need all this nonsensical addition. Im sure many of you also liked the ending. Me too. I liked the ending because all this nonsense finally stops, and they all become normal people again. Jerry is a little harder to tag. There is some trickery involved.

247,ReelVillain,Jeff Tomsic plays the great game,1,21 July 2020,"Friends are important throughout life, and while we may lose many across time there will forever be a handful we can never forget. That is the beautiful poetry of friendship, and also a far deeper message than anything Tag hands us. So I suppose the reel question is, why not just stay ""home""?Tag opens with a quote more tilted towards philosophy than comedy ""We don't stop playing because we get old, we get old because we stop playing"" and for the briefest of moments we are given the idea that this could be far a more intellectual movie than expected. This is the trap that Tag lays out for us. A good cast, a unique pitch, and the concept of a true-life tale all contribute to making us believe Tag could be outstanding, but within seconds of the film starting the value immediately depreciates.This misstep screams lunacy to me. There have been few films that are more directly positions to be about pure fun and silliness than Tag. It's a movie about grown men who play a playground game. How can anything bad be placed inside its 100-minute runtime? Don't worry Jeff Tomsic is willing to give us a master class in failure.Let's start with the characters. There are 5 ""players"" in the game. These are Hoggie, Chillie, Sable, Bob, and Jerry. None of which have a redeeming feature among them. Firstly there is Chillie, who is introduced to us via smoking weed with father after his wife has left him, Sable whom continually makes homophobic remarks while never actually addressing his feelings of insecurity, Hoggie whom lies and manipulates every one around him, Bob who's a director of an insurance company with some dark allegations and Jerry whom it's safe to say is a certified sociopath. Somehow we are supposed to like these men. Throw in Hoggies wife Anna (a woman that threatens everyone she meets with abuse and violence) and you have a good grasp of the main players. Despite this, I still have no addressed the main problem with Tag.Somewhere inside Tag lurks something truly ugly, an incurable sickness that stems from an unjustified hated towards both its characters and audience. The lowest points of the film come from jokes about waterboarding, miscarriage, and terminal illness. Miscarriage. How is that in any way acceptable for a movie to use and manipulate such topics? Which one of the producers was too busy dabbing their eyes dry from crying with laughter to not realise how truly heartbreakingly offensive it is? Who?What is most upsetting about Tag is generally speaking (Except for the poor man's Jason Bateman Ed Helms) the film is comprised of a strongly talented cast, with many well-respected actors. I can only presume there was some kind of blackmail involved in the casting process.Ironically Tag is just like a schoolyard bully. Horrible without justification and abusive to all that dare question it.1 slap in the face out of 5",Tag

If you like comides and aren't offended by ""adult humor"" (strictly dialog) you should give it a try.Oh, and I feel like they wrote and wanted the bar tender role for Zach Galifianakis but they couldn't get him so they casted someone to look and act like him. Maybe just me but I found that it took away from the movie.",Tag

263,jaymcguinness,A stretched out true story that misses the mark,5,7 January 2019,"Tag is a comedy based on a true story about a group of school friends who continue to play a game of tag into their adult lives.I personally really struggled with the plausibility of the plot. It is based on an article written in the Wall Street Journal about a real group of friends who tried to deceive each other one month a year by playing tag. It is very hard to believe that they actually did some of the things depicted in this movie.The writers Mark Steilen and Rob McKittrick being involved in their first major film release here, pushed the realms of reality too far.The only funny scenes in the movie for me all came from the same person. Lil Rel Howery (playing Reggie) has had a good few years starring in the Oscar winning Get Out, Tag and Bird Box. Nearly all of his scenes made me laugh and it was the only saving grace of the movie. Isla Fisher's character was interesting as the over competitive and aggressive member of the group. Jeremy Renner's scenes were all very superhero-esqe and it felt like a kids movie when he was involved, particularly early on.Overall, for the cast in this film...it missed the mark for me. 5/10",Tag

You probably won't remember it five years from now, but it's worth a rental. I would only buy it if it was on sale for like $5 of something. It's enjoyable enough and there could be worse movies to waste your time on. If you watch the trailer it pretty describes the whole movie. Ed Helms was little bit over the top to the point of being a little annoying but other than that the acting was good. It's nice to know that this was based on a true story.

I enjoyed this film, I found it funny, I laughed. I've no idea whether you will or not. It's quite gentle, silly humour which was what I was in the mood for. It's also got moments that are quite sweet - especially as it's based on real life, enduring friendships. The end credit clips are lovely for the same reason.

If you are profanity sensitive, don't watch it. If you have a problem with adults bringing out their inner child, don't watch it. If you are sensitive to anything that has to do with miscarriages, don't watch it - that part may have been borderline insensitive, but when you're playing to such a wide audience, you can't win them all anyway.

I was especially impressed with the fact that each one of them was unique and totally different from the other.
I doubt the real Tag game story was as a ggressive and exaggerated as the movie, and I wonder if the annoying female characters do exist in real life.
Isla Fisher character is terrible, she disrupted the flow, ruined the dynamics and was straight out bonkers in a bad way, on the other hand Jermey's annoying bride was fake and smug.
The Jouranlist and Rashid Jones were okey, I liked their cool headed attitude.

281,stevengiordullo,A Corporate and Unfunny Waste of Time.,2,15 June 2018,"Tag feels like a bunch of studio executives put together a stupid premise and a star studded cast so that hopefully they would make something that audiences would see; and from what I observed in the late Thursday showing that I attended, people were eating this movie up. I, however, found it to be one of the worst movies this year, and perhaps that will still be the case by the end of 2018. I usually find a lot of entertainment to dumb comedies such as this to watch with a big crowd, and this year was no exception (films such as Blockers and Game Night ended up being very enjoyable). The difference between this film and those two movies is very simple: The movie is horrendously unfunny and tone deaf. This movie suffers from an underdeveloped script and a premise that would only work if it was taken to the extreme, but this movie decides to play it safe for some reason with dumb slapstick that only exists to generate cheap laughs. This movie is insulting to the audience's intelligence by thinking that people would pay money to see such uninspired and dull filmmaking. There is also a lot of things that I didn't expect to take issue with and that was the fake smoke. Every time a character would smoke a cigarette or use a bong, it is so obvious that the smoke was added in post by the way it just disappears. How much do you not have to care to not even have the smoke look realistic? There is also this girl in the movie that two of the main characters have a crush on (Played by Rashida Jones) and it goes absolutely nowhere by the end of it and its only purpose was too pad the movie to an appropriate theatrical runtime. Which leads into the next problem, which is that the movie is super boring and horribly paced. The plot is so thin that the movie as no other choice than to just have the characters just hang out at random locations with horrible dialogue. The movie tries so hard to have heartwarming message about friendship but its not developed and is artificially used to try and connect with the audience. Most of the acting is ranges from tolerable to awful, the worst being Leslie Bibb, who plays Jeremy Renner's fiancé. Her acting is what gave me the most laughs in the movie. Her facial expressions are so over the top and her delivery is so ham fisted that you almost wouldn't believe that she was a professional actress. The one redeeming quality of this film would be the over the top action sequences of the rest of the gang trying to catch Jeremy Renner is some clever ways, and even though most of the humor was unbearable, I found that Hannibal's delivery of these lines were very well done, and I wish that he was in more movies; just not this one. Run away from this movie at all costs. Negatives:

303,chandIerbing,Can't believe I waited 2 years to watch this movie,9,20 August 2020,"Tag is a hilarious movie that would resonate with much of its target audience via its theme of friendship and adulthood.
It's a ride filled with laughter from start to finish and every single character is likeable. There was never a dull moment. One thing that the movie got right is to create a story and characters with heart. You really feel that bond of friendship and adventure, even more so towards the end.
The cast was impeccably chosen, with Isla Fisher really shining in her role of the intense and supportive wife. Every time she was on screen, it was delightful to watch. Watching the hilraious banter of the main cast, you feel a sense of jealousy at their close friendship and left wondering how they were like growing up.
The theme of adulthood, friendship and growing up are front and center in this movie, not in an obvious, shoehorned kind of way, but something that is organic and makes you really think. Of course, at its core, it is an over the top action comedy with great set pieces, but its humour doesn't lessen the gravity of the questions that you are left asking yourself.

309,ddemk,Tag Review,8,26 June 2018,"Jon Hamm (Mad Men), Jeremy Renner (Arrival), Isla Fisher (Arrested Development), and Ed Helms (Vacation) star in Tag, a comedy focused on a group of friends who have been playing in the same game of tag since 1983. As adults they now play the game through the month of May, with the characters going to extreme lengths to get the upper hand on their friends. In the opening scene Helms's character, Hoagie, goes as far as getting a job as a janitor at Bob Callahan's (Hamm) place of employment in order to tag him and make him ""it"". The elaborate schemes the characters go to throughout the film's hour and forty minutes are reminiscent of shenanigans seen in The Hangover or Superbad, as the group plots to finally tag Jerry Pierce (Renner), the one friend who has never been tagged in the game's 30 year history. Jake Johnson (Neighbors), Hannibal Buress (Blockers), Annabelle Wallis (The Brothers Grimm), and Rashida Jones (The Office) co-star in what was a highly enjoyable comedy.The film, while featuring an abundance of laugh out out loud moments as the characters repeatedly try and one-up each other, contains a strong message of the value of friendship. In an age where most people converge only to look at their phones or for weddings, children's birthday parties, etc; it is refreshing to see a group of people remain active in each others lives based on something as simple as a kids game. This film, which was based on a true story (in the end credits video clips of the actual participants are shown, which demonstrate the hi-jinx in the movie aren't highly exaggerated) and although the characters sometimes go to extreme lengths (some highly extreme) to get the upper hand on each other, you can tell through the strong acting performances of Helms, Hamm, and Fisher that these people genuinely care for one another.Tag will likely not go down as one of the greatest comedies of all time (I gave it 8 stars on iMDB), but it was an enjoyable, feel good movie in a time where it's nice to smile for 100 minutes. Very strong performances from Hamm (who has shown his range between this and Beirut being released not far apart), Fisher (who is highly underrated for both her comedic timing and ability to display raw emotion) and Helms (who also showed his range recently in Chappaquidick, released at the same time as Beirut). Released at a good time before a majority of summer blockbusters hit screens, if you're looking for something enjoyable for a few laughs, this is ""it"" (sorry). Thanks for reading.",Tag

Movies are meant to be enjoyed, some fun time with friends and Family and it is not meant always to be a thinking process Christopher Nolan fans?. And this movie is Super Fun. Ok I know it has a wafer thin plot or I could say that no plot at all. But what the heck who cares if you are entertained and you have had pretty good laughs at the antiques carried by the adult characters in this game of movie or movie of a game. It is acceptable both ways trust me. It has got some of favourite cheesy lines like"" You never quit playing because you are Old, You are old because you have quit playing."" So life is a a game. Keep playing!!. And some other cheesy lines like"" You are not living if you leave in the Past and not in the present "". Profound but cliche and cheesy!!
So all in all it is a movie about a group of friends who have kept on the tradition of playing a game called TAG for 30 years of their life. I will not give more information then that. Highly Entertaining and Fun Ride. Just for a moment leave your brain at home and Enjoy the Fun!!!",Tag

Not the fact he was token, I mean, that happens in movies to this day. It was the fact that they made him the stupid one, constantly making barely intelligible statements, saying things that were either obvious or just plain ridiculous. He seemed to me to be tacked on, an afterthought, a very late addition to the process. Was hardly a real part of the banter. The actor (Hannibal Duress) looked and sounded uncomfortable and delivered his lines in a lacklustre manner. And the most telling scene for me was where they all get out of the car and are filmed in slow-motion walking together towards the ceremony. There's a shot which pans across the cast on screen, but it misses the black guy out!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The film does a better-than-expected job at taking a ridiculous premise and turning it into a feature-length film. Although some critics have attacked the film for being R-rated when it's literally about a game played by children, I actually consider that a strength, not a weakness. Going the R-rated route actually creates a lot more room for plot development, because anything can happen at that point. And believe me when I say that you will be shocked at the extremes that these characters go to at this point.Many of the gags are so out there that one should wonder if director Jeff Tomsic consulted with Seth MacFarlane on how to have gags that would normally appear in an episode of 'Family Guy' work in a live-action film as opposed to in a cartoon. By the way, if you're not a fan of that type of humor, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.Isla Fisher. This is her best performance in a comedy since 'Wedding Crashers.' Actually, I lied. This is her best performance in a comedy, PERIOD. If the Golden Globes had its Supporting Actor/Actress categories divided into Comedy and Drama categories (like they do with the Lead Actor/Actress categories), Fisher would be a lock for a nomination right now. Her character is so psychotic and zealous when it comes to playing ""tag"" that you can probably make an entire ""losing his/her sh**"" YouTube video like the ones of Nicolas Cage, Jack Nicholson, and John Goodman, just from this film alone.The film actually has a plot. It's not the best-written plot, but it's a plot that has the characters do more than just play tag for 100 minutes. When they're not playing tag, they're doing other stupid thing such as smoking pot, spying on each other while having sex, breaking into each other's houses, etc. Oh, and there's some drama at some points as well.
 THE BAD
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MAN, do I wish this was a cartoon instead of live-action. The more I think about just how similar this kind of comedy is to that of 'Family Guy,' the more I wonder, ""what could've been?"" But on the bright side, at least that means I now know a live-action 'Family Guy' movie can work.The comedy can be a bit mean-spirited at times.Again, we have a plot, but it's not the best-written plot. There are some problems. Such as: Um... any particular reason it's mentioned that Ed Helms and Isla Fisher have a ""first child"" but that ""first child"" is NEVER shown? Also, Jake Johnson's character is soooo stereotypical when it comes to being a pothead. I don't mind being stereotypical as long as it's not outright offensive, AND AS LONG AS THE STEREOTYPE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE PLOT (which does NOT happen in this case). Furthermore, what the hell is Rashida Jones doing in this movie? She makes virtually no contribution to the plot whatsoever, other than stir up drama between Jon Hamm and Jake Johnson that for the most part goes nowhere.
 THE UGLY
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first 90 minutes were great. The last 10 minutes were abysmal. Whoever thinks it would be a good idea have this movie end with a resolution as FORCED and SENTIMENTAL as what I saw in the theater should not be allowed to work in Hollywood. As a person who has written screenplays for (un-produced) feature-length comedies, whoever wrote that ending should know that you should never, EVER insert last-minute hardcore drama that late into a comedy film. This kind of stuff should be introduced no later than the early part of the third act. Anything later than that could cause serious damage to, if not outright ruin the film. Did this ending ruin the film for me? No, but only because the film ends on a high note, AND the drama seems to be ignored by the main characters quickly enough for me to wonder if the drama itself was meant to be a joke. But if that's the case, that joke stands out as the only joke in the film that falls flat. And it falls flat HARD. Ah, well. At least the random musical number by Jeremy Renner, Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, and Jake Johnson during the credits cheered me up.",Tag

351,acroyer,Astonishing!,4,19 June 2018,"I wanted to leave after 10 minutes of this pure-crap fest but I didn't want to make a fuss with my group. What's astonishing is the waste of talent with seriously juvenile writing. Hmm, let's see, how many dick jokes can we try to make funny? If that doesn't work let's try 'jerking each other off', you know, for that cringey feeling like an R rated 'Office' episode. No? How about a scene about a woman faking a mis-carriage. Or how about marijuana jokes? Anyone? And on and on.
Tag has a fun concept but the execution is terrible. I found all of the characters and the actors playing them very unlikable. What I was cringing at was watching how earnest Jon Hamm was in trying to be funny and falling flat on his face. Why was Rashida Jones in this and playing against a sub-par actor like Jake Johnson? Did they need to pad out the budget in order to have pizza everyday for the crew? Annabelle Wallis was pure eye candy for sure and that's all she was directed to be. When the group of men were talking and shouting over each other, with incoherent editing to hide the seriously cornball writing, the director made sure to include a shot of Annabelle raising an eyebrow or rolling her eyes, just to remind the audience that she was still there. 
People are saying that the 'tag' scenes were impressive but they actually play out like action scenes in ALL modern movies, that being heavily edited with YUGE sound effects and no kinetic affect. Blech!
I hated this movie and couldn't wait to get out. No, it is NOT funny like the original Hangover. No, I am not a humorless individual. I like raunchy comedies but not for the sake of being raunchy. Seriously, the best thing about Tag was the very end where they showed actual footage of the men who played the game in reality.

For such a ridiculous concept, 'Tag' doesn't treat itself seriously and is pretty self-aware (for the most part). The editing was really good for a comedy movie, especially the HotFuzz's seamless transitions. I had a couple chuckles and a laugh but anticipated a lot more from such a comedy. 
Where did all the money go? Aside from some nice looking cinematography, casting and the movie being in focus, nothing shows where did the 28 million dollars go. Most of the characters weren't developed aside from one character-trait. There were some pacing issues in the dialogue and the majority of the jokes are just being told.

At that point, a character appeared to be having a miscarriage. It was treated seriously by all the characters, and the game suspended.But then, it's revealed that it was faked. That's right. It was a backup plan to ensure that Jeremy Renner's character could get out of getting tagged. She was never pregnant. Not only wasn't it a lie, but the characters that orchestrated this lie just laughed and had a grand time with their cleverness in this ""escape.""Miscarriage is NOT A JOKE. Period. It seemed as if the movie was making light of miscarriages and the pain and trauma mothers experience when it does happen.This one moment took this movie from a 9 star rating down to a 4 star rating.",Tag
392,laerkeworm,"It was funny, I guess, but the female journalist...",6,23 May 2019,"Like the title says, I guess it was funny. I mean, I laughed at several points, but I just could not get past how utterly superfluous the female journalist was.I have a hard time imagining a Wall Street Journal journalist would spontanously chase a story about a group of adult men playing tag without even consulting her editor, (not uncommon in movies, I know). I kept looking for a good reason for her to be there, and it just never came! It was so obvious she was there for exposition, it was painful. And she stopped being exposition after they told her they play tag, and just became a random person tagging along! I concluded early on that she was Jerry's actual fianceé, sent to spy on the guys and get to know his friends, before betraying them at a crucial moment. When Leslie Bibb showed up I concluded that she was a hired actress, but no.The female journalist was so bland that I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen to her. I hate this trope but I would have almost prefered for her to become the love interest of one of the guys, but that didn't happen either. I didn't even get the feeling that she'd become friendly with the guys - heck, I don't even remember if she had a name!It was a good movie that subverted some tropes and fell straight into a couple of others. I liked that the fianceé was supportive the way she was, and I'm glad that it had a more 'realistic' ending than a happily ever after where everyone got paired up, but I'm sorry, I just cannot get past that Wall Street Journal journalist!! I'm so confused about it that it's making me angry!",Tag

There's a fake miscarriage scene but at during the scene you don't know if it's truly fake.

422,justjoia,"Tag is ""it"" for your raunchy slapstick comedy of the Summer",7,25 June 2018,"You can't make this stuff up... wait, this is based on a true story?!? Believe it or not, this ridiculous movie is based in part on a Wall Street Journal article from 2013! The movie differs a little bit. Our group of guys have been playing since they were little kids, but the original crew started in high school. There are some tags taken directly from the original crew's home videos, but the majority of the film has taken artistic license to make the tags more entertaining and the film, overall more interesting.Basically a group of men started a game of tag that has lasted over 30 years. Every month of May they play and then who ever is left as ""it"" at the end of the month has to suffer in shame until the next May. The game can be played anywhere in the world and the players just have to basically stalk each other in order to tag each other. They even have an official document stating the rules as well as their agreement to participate.Jeremy Renner (Avengers) is Jerry, who has never been ""it"" and wants to protect his perfect record. The character is a bad ass, gym owning, black belt certified athlete who has always prided himself on never getting tagged as ""it"". Jeremy Renner definitely pokes a little fun at himself and his role as ""Hawkeye"" in the Avengers films in this role.Ed Helms (the Office) is ""Hoagie"" and the apparent main character of this film, along with his wife Anna played by Isla Fisher(Wedding Crashers). Isla Fisher slips effortlessly into yet another ""crazy but beautiful"" role as Hoagie's equally competitive, slightly psycho wife, who is desperate to be included in the game and is the root of many of the slapstick follies. The two of them travel all around the United States to collect the rest of the group in order to knock Jerry off of his ""perfect record"" throne before he retires after he marries the beautiful Susan (Leslie Bibb).Hoagie gets himself hired as a janitor at a fortune 500 company and dons an elaborate disguise in order to tag successful CEO Callahan (Jon Hamm), who happens to be in the middle of a very important interview for the Wall Street Journal when the sneaky and ingenious tag takes place. Intrigued by the zaniness of the game and all that it entails, the writer played by Annabelle Wallis, demands to join the quest to collect the rest group and tag the un-tag-able.First stop is Colorado, to pick up stoner extraordinaire Randy (Jake Johnson). Much like Jeremy Renner reprises his role as Hawkeye in this film, Randy is basically an exaggerated version of the role Jake Johnson played as ""Nick"" in ""The New Girl"" with just a ton more cannabis. Once he agrees to join the group in hunting down Jerry and tagging him DURING his wedding (where NONE of them were invited), they move on to coerce Sable played by Hannibal Buress (Broad City) while he is in the middle of a therapy session. Once the team is assembled, they all travel together to the men's home town only to discover that Jerry has been expecting them. Shenanigans ensue, including a joke or two that might cross the line regarding what's ok and what's not ok to joke about.I laughed my ass off throughout this film. While I highly doubt this film will earn any award nominations, I enjoyed just about every minute of it. I know it's hard to imagine, but it does carry a heart warming message and the group became even closer than they already have been over the past couple of decades. In a world of high tech gadgets and gizmos we all depend on to help us remain connected to each other, this film shows that a simple game can be the thread that binds across the miles and over the years.",Tag

I don't think I laughed again, I may have raised the odd smile here and there. The acting is good, but the story line is silly and way over the top. It says based on the true story and there is a clip in the credits of the real tag team, but I can't help but think how much was staged as a promotion for this film. The honest truth is it didn't keep my interest and I fell asleep towards the end and had to rewind.

436,kylecon,"Good Story, Bad Comedy",4,1 May 2019,"Tag had such a great concept and story, and the cast was pretty good, but it was all poorly executed. My main issue with this movie was that it was an R rated comedy that relied on inappropriate language and blatant, crude humor to get laughs, which it does not do well. The movie is about a bunch of friends who play tag all the way up until their fully grown adults, so you would expect it to be a ridiculous ""group-of-friends"" comedy that shows the adults acting like kids, and to be honest, that would fit much better that the comedy we did get. Every minute was jam-packed with mindless mature jokes, and it got old after about 5 minutes. In my opinion, the best scene in the movie was somewhere near the beginning when Jeremy Renner's character, Jerry, walks into a dimly lit room with an intense score playing reminiscent of an action movie and when he notices all of his friends hiding, he asks, ""Who's It?"" before an action sequence begins. This immediately took me back to the days on the playground, because ""who's it"" was what everybody would constantly yell out while running around. It's such a small detail, but I absolutely love it. The line just goes to show how good this movie could have been, had it tried to live up to it's name. Ultimately, the terrible sense of humor ruined this movie, to the point where it didn't even feel like they were playing tag. I would've loved to see people calling out random places to be ""bases"" or ""safe spots"" and getting really mad when they got tagged. That actually leads me to my next point, the stakes. We see the group of friends constantly getting tagged intentionally (throughout the whole movie) and it really contradicted the dialogue as well as actual tag. Being ""it"" should be a big deal, and a burden the person deals with. But because of these constant exchanges, being ""it"" is discredited and it feels lame. It should be clear at all times who is it, and we should be able to tell based on how the characters treat him. I would want to see the friends all keeping their distance and making a big deal out of staying away from whoever is it. The last main issue I have with this movie is the character: The character development. The main point that this movie should drive home is that these people are, at the end of the day, just a bunch of friends that are fooling around and playing a game, but Jerry was completely disconnected from the other men and never gave us any impression that they had been friends for as long as they supposedly had been. In addition to this, Jerry is way to over-the-top when it comes to avoiding being tagged. He has secret lairs, tech, and way to advance of a strategy. It really did make the movie seem unrealistic and disconnected from reality. The other characters were all underwhelming and I didn't really care about Hoagie's implied death at the end, which ruined the whole sequence because there was no real emotional value. So far, I've only expressed what I disliked about this movie (which was a WHOLE lot) so I should say what I liked about it. The fighting and stunt choreography for Jerry was super fun to watch. The tag chases through building were all fast paced and exciting, I especially like the hospital tag at the end. But that's it.Overall rating: 4/10 (not good)",Tag

As with generally any comedy with an outrageous concept, Tag isn't highbrow and you can't really take it seriously (which is a mistake I believe a lot of the negative reviewers made here). What I loved about Tag is that they took the already interesting and humorous concept of grown men playing a kid's game and just RAN WITH IT. The action in this movie was outrageous and not at all realistic, but that's just what was needed. 
Tag doesn't take itself too seriously and makes the most with its initial concept, like any group of fun-loving friends would. Tag is great if you're looking for an easy watch that's hilarious and fun!",Tag

I thought that the premise of adults playing tag was ok if good executed, but it wasn't. There weren't a lot of jokes and the movie was relying on the high energy. The plot of the movie is also very thin, because the entire movie was talking and case scenes. For the most part I was bored and at the end I almost fell asleep . The pacing was bad and several times I I thought the movie was ending. There was a lot of filler and without it the movie would be an hour. There was a big problem with the tone. During the cases some of the injuries were treated seriously and other times the action was cartoonish and people were punched with fire extinguishers and battering rams without any injuries. The acting wasn't good as well. Ed Helms did a good job of playing Ed Helms and the Wall street journalist Annabelle Wallis just stood around doing nothing. The characters weren't written very interesting. They were ether psychopaths or they had no development, except for the pot guy. The directing wasn't good. There was no style to it. Nothing interesting or new. It was like all other bad comedies. The budget of the movie is 28 million dollars which is very high and I am not sure were the money went.

488,mg-18796,A waste of time,1,20 August 2018,"This is my first review ever. Why? Because it was such horrible movie. A wasted ensemble of great comedic actors. The likable Ed Helms develops into an accidentally infuriating individual in this movie. Everything seemed just so manufactured. From the first interaction to the life and death situation. You'll be able to tell what happens next in every scene. You can see some chemistry, but it all falls flat as it gets too over the top (annoyingly) and repetitive. You will certainly end up caring lesser and lesser for the characters in the movie. Do yourself a favor and watch blockers instead. I feel bad for Jeremy Renner since he could've been in Mission Impossible: Fallout and/or Avengers, but instead he showed up in Tag. Can you say career suicide? If this is his only appearance in a movie for 2018 he's sure to lose some fans. If only I could give it a zero.",Tag
489,lowzieuk,The first movie that has ever upset me...,1,30 June 2018,"I love movies and love comedies. Goofy comedies are me and my wife's standard go-to especially when we need cheering up. Tag was 5 minutes away from being one of those movies we would get down from the self and watch again and again. Instead it left us both deeply hurt and upset. To give that context; I have never been offended, hurt or upset by any movie I have ever seen, and I've watched a lot.The problem is this; the way this film handles the topic of miscarriage is so crass and badly handled it is laughing AT anyone who has been through that particular trauma. If any of the writers had been through miscarriage there is no way they would have treated it the way they did. Other difficult topics in this movie are not handled well but at least the writers recognised that they deserve pathos. The studio and writers however believe miscarriage is some minor inconvenience that can be the butt of a joke. The stress and trauma of a miscarriage is clinically assessed as being higher than cancer treatment and just below the death of a partner and one third of women following miscarriage exhibit symptoms of PTSD. Some topics are beyond comedy and if you go anywhere near them you had better be extremely skilled at what you're doing. These film makers were not.And here's what is so upsetting is that the writers thought that was funny then after months and months of oversight by studio executives they thought it was okay. Then the half a dozen actors who acted it out thought it was okay. Everyone taking part in the filming of this scene thought it was okay. How scared were they of speaking up and/or how detached from reality?Tag has the feel of a movie written by rich spoiled people who have never been through real difficulty. Nearly every major life trauma in it is laughed at and dismissed but not in a cathartic and healing way but in a narcissistic, almost sociopathic way. There is a great movie in here, there probably still is in the editing room and the true story it is based on sounds fantastic but the movie that got released has a cruel heart.If these film makers care about people at all they'll pull it from cinemas, makes some editing changes and re-release it. Because me and my wife were left deeply shaken after watching this film, online many people are already saying the same and many more are about to be hurt and upset by it. Do the right thing.",Tag

Tag is a great movie about some people that played tag for 30 years and the new season just began
one guy is ''it,, and has to tag the other guys but there is one guy that hasn't been tagt in all those 30 years and this year they will have to work as a group to tag him.I liked the film because it had lots of good comedy in it and I had a lot of laughs,
the storyline is actually very stupid but it has been stitched together to a good comedy movie
where there is something to laugh about all the time.
The actors did a great job, especially when jerry got married and then that slowmotion scene
the music they used is perfect and it really makes the movie.My overall opinion is that it is a great film that has a good sense of humor, acted super good and the movie is filmed great, perosnaly I would recommend this film to people that are in for a laugh.",Tag
