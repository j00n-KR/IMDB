0,TheLittleSongbird,The emotional roller-coaster Castle,7,12 October 2017,"The book is wonderful, one of my favourite and most memorable reads in recent years. It was thought-provoking, harrowing and poignant, with a chillingly troubled but complex portrayal of dysfunctional family life. So there were high expectations on that front, as well as that a great cast were involved.Seeing 'The Glass Castle' last night, it is a pretty well done film on its own terms despite a few faults. On the other hand, it is very understandable why it has been said that as an adaptation it is mishandled. Although always striving to judge a film adaptation always as a standalone, if asked which is better between the book and the film the answer's a no brainer. The book feels much more balanced and more complex and the ending rang true far more. Although 'The Glass Castle' has a huge amount to recommend and is better than some of the mixed critical reception suggests (personal opinion), its ending and some tonal issues are its biggest faults.Particularly in the case of the ending. Not just because it is drenched in sentimentality that is hard even for the strongest of stomachs. Even more so because things feel wrapped up too tidily and patly, the ending is far more realistic in the source material and should have made it on film, definitely would have preferred something more daring than a conclusion that really did not ring true and felt tacked on. Another issue with the ending is that we are told up to the end one thing about Rex and Rose Mary, and it is so overwhelming in evidence that it's easy to believe, then at the end it does a complete 180 degrees and it was just hard to buy.While not as problematic, things do get a little melodramatic in places and the point of view of the film is somewhat too one-sided, with much more development to Rose Mary and showing her as equally accountable there would have been more complexity.However, 'The Glass Castle' is a beautifully shot film and the production values are never less than top drawer. The music is neither too intrusive or too low-key and the direction is skillful visually, handles most of the tonal and time shifts well and with good attention to making the portrayal of the family as real as possible.Script flows naturally and is thought-provoking and nuanced. The story has its problems, but mostly it is very compelling, hard-hitting and pathos-filled. It's particularly good in its careful balance of laughter and tears, the intense but also profound understanding of the central father-daughter bond and in the twisted but troubled portrayal of the dysfunctional family. Apart from Rose Mary being underwritten and underused, the characters are more than archetypal clichés, Jeannette is especially well realised.Woody Harrelson gives a courageously gutsy performance as a pretty reprehensible human being, while Brie Larson's Jeanette is powerfully conflicted. All the children are well cast, with Ella Anderson in particular being an absolute revelation. Naomi Watts does a very good job with what she has.In conclusion, adaptation-wise it is mishandled and the ending really doesn't ring true at all, but it's a well made emotional roller-coaster with a believable portrayal of dysfunctional family life and stellar performances deserving of some kind of award recognition (Harrelson, Larson and Anderson in particular). 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Glass Castle
1,SnoopyStyle,complicated family,8,1 December 2017,"Jeannette Walls (Brie Larson) and David (Max Greenfield) are a yuppie couple in 80's NYC. She is horrified to see her parents dumpster diving. The movie tells the story of her growing up with her troubled parents (Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts) and her three siblings in a volatile nomadic lifestyle.I didn't read the Jeannette's autobiographical novel. I think I've seen another movie with a similar premise but I don't remember what it's called. Some of this seem familiar without knowing where the story is headed. At first, the childhood story overshadows the future story. Woody is doing some great work. One can see both the love and the fear from young Jeannette. I wasn't sold on older Jeannette until Brie turns up the volume during the arm wrestling scene. She fully rises up to Woody's level. It's great dueling performances. It does need to find a way to wrap up the story. The third act meanders but I give it some leeway as real life. It's hard to manufacture a climax. I'd probably tighten the ending. The movie runs on too long anyways. I love the two performances and like her clashing feelings about her parents. Family are complicated.",The Glass Castle
2,Horst_In_Translation,Defining film in father-daughter relationships and parents neglecting their children,10,12 October 2017,"""The Glass Castle"" is an American English-language film from this year (2017) directed by Hawaiian filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton and he also adapted the novel for the screen here. It's not the first time he worked with Oscar winner Brie Larson, who plays the central character here. And she proves once more without a doubt that she is among the very finest from her age group in Hollywood now. But still, this is without a doubt Woody Harrelson's film here and the only thing in doubt is if he should win the Oscar for supporting or lead. His character is somewhat similar to Viggo Mortensen's Captain Fantastic and also he has as much of an impact as Arquette in Boyhood and if these two were getting such a great deal of recognition, then so should he as it was simply an amazing portrayal here.Let me add that I have not read the novel, so my review is entirely based on the film and I cannot comment on parallels and differences compared to the book. But I can say that the book must be amazing to be as good as these slightly over 2 hours we have here. The film is by far the best of 2017 by now and that means especially something as I have seen a lot from this year already and I cannot agree with the mixed reception at all. It is close to a masterpiece. The actors are all good, even the dude from New Girl is tolerable this time. Harrelson is the great standout though and I see he has 2 films in the race this year and it is really high time he gets his Oscar. Very overdue. As for the film itself, it may not be a dominant player this awards season if I see the reception and also because people will say it is the specific story of one family, but irrelevant in the grand picture. This may be true, the first part, but I think they could not be any more wrong about the second. There's important subjects like coming-of-age, alcoholism, father-daughter relationships, husband-wife relationships, sexual abuse, criminal negligence and many others in here and yet the film never feels rushed or for the sake of it, but more like an in-depth examination of these issues that is always satisfying.Everybody will think something else about the subplots and it will depend on your history how much you will connect with each of these. But I think that there is something in here for everybody and even as a neutral observer, it will be tough not to appreciate the film. This is also due to the great attention to detail. Just one example from near the end: The moment the central character stands still before entering her dad's room one last time because she does(n't) know what expects her at the other side of the door. Harrelson raises the bar to a spectacular level for future performances of loving dads whose approach to life and whose own demons keep them from being the parent their children need them to be. This film's raw authenticity, the characters' imperfection as well as many heartbreaking moments turn this onto one of the very best films of the 2010s. Don't trust the critics talking down on it. This is my Best Picture winner of 2017 at this point and you really need to see it because it is so good and you have a lot more to gain than to lose here. Chances are almost zero you will hate it, but they are good that you will totally love it. So much heart in here and it never drags despite comfortably crossing the 2-hour mark. Go get that Oscar Woody.",The Glass Castle
3,kosmasp,Growing up - difficult,8,3 March 2018,"Raising children is not easy. Being a child growing up in an unstable relationship and general instability character wise (parents wise that is), is not easy either. This movie is not easy to watch is what I'm trying to say. But it is rewarding if you are into dramas and really good performances. The lines are blurred between good and bad, and what parenting is about and how or what you should learn from the usually most important people in your life.Woody Harrelson gives a powerhouse performance, which elevates but is also enhanched through the other great performances. As the saying goes, what doesn't kill you ... So if you like slow moving drama with a distraught time line, this is the one you may like",The Glass Castle
4,lee_eisenberg,dysfunctional childhood and questionable adulthood,7,19 November 2017,"I should start by noting that I've never read Jeannette Wells's autobiography, and had never even heard of her until I saw ""The Glass Castle"". The movie is interesting, as the protagonist remembers her unhappy childhood. But it becomes clear that despite the well-off life that she has as an adult, there's something unresolved.Brie Larson puts in a good performance as Jeannette, but the movie really belongs to Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts as her parents. The dad was abusive and the mom spent most of her time on art. Not surprisingly, the family didn't manage to stay in a house for long periods of time.I've read that the movie didn't fully capture the book's spirit. I guess that's always the case with movies. On its own, the movie is worth seeing. I recommend it. Watch for Iain Armitage (Shailene Woodley's character's son on ""Big Little Lies"" and young Sheldon on the spin off of ""The Big Bang Theory"").",The Glass Castle
5,writers_reign,Walls Have Fears,8,7 October 2017,"What follows is my take on the movie ONLY as I appear to be alone in not having read the book, in fact, for the record I had never HEARD of either the book or the movie until it opened in London yesterday. I checked out the credits, noted that it featured Brie Larson and that was sufficient for me. Woody Harrelson I can take (Cheers) or leave (Natural Born Killers) but my admiration for Larson, who I saw and enjoyed in two fine movies is boundless so I high-tailed it to the box office for the very first screening. There appears to be a consensus that the movie played false with the book on several counts but, as I noted above I can only comment on what ended up on the screen. Both Larson AND Harrelson were exceptional and I would not begrudge either an Oscar or at least a nomination. The young Jeanette held her own with both and at times eclipsed them. Definitely one of the finest Hollywood movies of the year.",The Glass Castle
6,ferguson-6,We all have stories,6,10 August 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. We all have our stories. The stories that make up our life. Some of us dwell on the ""bad"" things, while others remember only the good times. A few even romanticize the past, which could also be termed embellishment. Where exactly on this scale that Jeannette Walls' story falls is debatable, but the facts are that her life story is the foundation for a best-selling book and now a high-profile movie.Ms. Walls' memoir describes her unconventional childhood with bohemian parents who cared more for freedom and independence than for feeding their kids. Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (a 'must-follow' filmmaker after his powerful 2013 indie gem SHORT TERM 12) chose this as his next project, co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Lanham, and wisely opted to work again with Brie Larson, who stars as the oldest Jeannette (from late teens through adult).The film bounces around in time from Jeannette's childhood in the 1960's and 1970's to her time as a New York gossip columnist in 1989. The timeline isn't all that bounces, as we watch this family of six, seemingly always on the run, ricochet across America with all their belongings strapped to the top of the battered station wagon – usually on the run from creditors or following the latest dream from Rex (Woody Harrelson).Rex is the type of guy who rants against most everything that makes up what we know as society. He can't (or won't) hold a job and fills his trusting kids' heads with hopes and dreams of a better tomorrow - going as far as drawing up plans and specs for the off-the-grid fantasy home referenced in the title. Rex then spends what little money the dirt poor family has on drinking benders which cause him to become a nasty, abusive threat.Rex's wife Rose (Naomi Watts) is a free-spirited artist who somehow possesses even fewer parental instincts than her husband. Although she could be labeled an enabler of his abusive ways, she might actually be the more interesting of the two, even if the story (and Jeannette) focuses much more on Rex. The best scene in the movie is when mother and grown daughter share a restaurant booth, and the two worlds collide.Of course the real story here is how Jeanette managed to rise above this less-than-desirable childhood and achieve her own form of freedom as a writer. The stark contrast between the squalor of her West Virginia shack and the million dollar apartment she later shares with her fiancé (Max Greenfield) makes this the ultimate depiction of the American Dream – pulling yourself up by your bootstraps (even when you don't have boots).The acting is stellar throughout. Mr. Harrelson could garner Oscar attention as he manages to capture both the dreamer and failure that was Rex. Ms. Watts maximizes her underwritten role and turns Rose into someone we believe we know and (at least partially) understand. Ms. Larson embodies both the desperation of a teenager whose environment forced her to be wise beyond her years, and the iciness of a grown-up trying so hard to leave the past behind. In just a few scenes, Robin Bartlett manages to create a memorable and horrific grandmother – one whose actions explain a great deal. The most remarkable performance of all, however, belongs to Ella Anderson (the only good thing about THE BOSS). She captures our hearts as the adolescent Jeannette – the closest thing to a parent this family had.There are some similarities between this film and last year's expertly crafted CAPTAIN FANTASTIC. In fact, two of the young actors (Shree Crooks, Charlie Shotwell) from that film also appear in THE GLASS CASTLE. The biggest difference being that Viggo Mortensen's character could be considered to have an over-parenting approach, while Woody Harrelson's Rex never over-did anything, except drink and dream. The movie probably has a bit too much Hollywood gloss and sheen to adequately portray the hardships of a large family living in poverty, though the top notch acting keeps us glued to the screen. By the end, we can't help but wonder if some of Ms. Walls' romanticism of her father and past might be due as much to her immense writing talent as to her childhood challenges.",The Glass Castle
7,phd_travel,Horrific child neglect story told with a light tone,7,1 December 2017,There is a voyeuristic element that keeps the viewer watching this fascinating story. Two loving parents - an alcoholic father and negligent mother raise their kids in a nomadic vagrant style. The family is close and there is affection but the neglect is horrific. There is a comic tone but the horror is what prevails. The way the kids pulled through is amazing.Woody is perfect for the insane father. Naomi tries to look disheveled but is still too pretty to be homeless. Brie looks very beautiful in her New York lifestyle. The dramatic confrontation at the end seems a bit contrived.I haven't read the book so can't say whether it's a good adaptation of the source material. Whatever it is the movie is engrossing.,The Glass Castle
8,deloudelouvain,Away from the supposed normal way of living,8,10 March 2018,"A wonderful movie based on a true story, but the story shouldn't be remembered as an example on how to live life. There are of course good points about their way of living, free from the daily routine and the pressure to contribute to society and fitting in, but the minor points are that the father is just a hopeless drunk that rather had his drinks and fags then providing food for his family. But the story is very captivating, it won't let anybody indifferent. The cast is very well chosen, with Woody Harrelson and Ella Anderson as the most outstanding actors in this movie. But Naomi Watts and Brie Larson were also very good in their roles, as the rest of the cast. At the end of the movie you get to see the real characters of this movie remembering their deceased father, and of course all remembering the good times. Never talk bad about the dead, that's how it is. But not everything was a clear blue sky, on the contrary. The Glass Castle is one of the better movies I saw lately and I could only recommend it.",The Glass Castle
9,blanbrn,A time of reflection that proves no matter who or how your family love lasts forever.,7,12 August 2017,"""The Glass Castle"" is one of those sentimental feel good films that shows how one reflects to the past to see how it determined one's path and upbringing in life. Still love is the rock that causes flow. Brie Larson's character is now a success a woman who's in business and married still she thinks and reconnects back to the times when she was a young woman and remembers the poverty and different way of life that her family had for her still tough love would win out and shape her. Woody Harrelson shines as her country and hard working smart father proving that outspoken love and work ethic wins out and over. This film proves be proud of family and remember your roots no matter how far you go love shapes and guides it will never leave or grow old.",The Glass Castle
10,Hellmant,Filled with one heartbreaking scene after another!,8,17 August 2017,"'THE GLASS CASTLE': Four Stars (Out of Five) The new drama adapted from the 2005 memoir (of the same name) by Jeannette Walls, based on her experiences growing up in a poor dysfunctional family. The film was directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (who also helmed the 2013 critical darling 'SHORT TERM 12'), and it was written by Cretton and Andrew Lanham. The movie stars Brie Larson (who also starred in 'SHORT TERM 12'), Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts, Ella Anderson, Chandler Head and Max Greenfield. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office so far. I found it to be a little too long, and slow-paced, but it's mostly a very moving and enjoyable film.The story is told from Jeannette's (Larson) point of view, as an adult, as she recollects on growing up as a child in extreme poverty. Her mother, Rose Mary (Watts), was an eccentric artist, and her father, Rex (Harrelson), was a free-spirited alcoholic. Jeannette, and her three siblings, were constantly forced to move, and often times they didn't have enough to eat, or ideally safe conditions to live in. The whole time Rex filled the children's heads with unrealistic hopes and dreams of a better life.The movie is filled with one heartbreaking scene after another, I cried multiple times throughout the entire film. Larson plays the central character in it (as an adult), but Harrelson actually has far more screen time; and he's the real star of the movie (in my opinion) as well. As flawed a character as he is, Harrelson's character is also (in some ways) the most relatable, at least for me, due to his dreams and generally positive outlook on life. The film has many great moments in it too, but it seems to lose it's way at times, and it's sometimes a pain to sit through (due to it's pacing). 'SHORT TERM 12' is definitely a much better film, but this movie had a lot of potential to it. I think it's definitely still worth seeing.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j_XDrmlMJNY",The Glass Castle
11,ThomasDrufke,"Jumbled, but Worth Your Time",7,12 October 2018,"I find these types of films to be fascinating. Movies are about escapism, they always have been. So I appreciate when films attempt to actually bring you into a world which you have never explored. Leave No Trace, Captain Fantastic, and now The Glass Castle are all films that deal with families living in places/areas that are unlike where/how 99% of Americans live. It doesn't get everything right, but I did find some of the film to be very appealing. However, the critics of the film commenting on the fact that the film has a jumbled tone of dark abusive family relationship mixed with a hilarious family ""road trip"" like comedy at times. From what I hear, the book is a deep, emotional tale of a dysfunctional family trying to put together the missing pieces from childhood. Make no mistake though, there are some disturbing sequences in this film that show abuse far more so than I figured this film would tackle. The performances are great, and that keeps the film afloat in its weaker moments, and ultimately it's certainly an interesting watch.7.1/10",The Glass Castle
12,cricketbat,A fascinating book that got a watered-down movie,6,28 December 2018,"My wife read The Glass Castle before we watched this movie, and many of the shocking things she shared with me from the book didn't make it into the film. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to water down and even sugarcoat the true events so that this dysfunctional family could seem more relatable. The problem is, that makes the story less interesting and the movie becomes a bland feel-good indie flick.",The Glass Castle
13,inkblot11,"Yes, the book is a great deal better; but, this is still a very worthy film about rising out of poverty",7,12 October 2017,"Jeannette (Brie Larson) is dressed to party in a Manhattan taxi cab when she looks out the window and inwardly screams. Nearby, rooting through a dumpster, is her homeless mother, Rose Mary (Naomi Watts). As Jeannette is with her likewise well-groomed fiancé, she doesn't relate her sighting. But, soon after, she calls her mother to invite her to lunch. Its there, watching her mother devour food and talk on as if nothing is unusual, that Jeannette begins to remember her childhood. Eccentric is almost too slight a word. Her artist mother and her brilliant but devious father Rex (Woody Harrelson) never hold steady jobs and wander around the Southwest USA, always trying to outrun the bill collectors. At a young age, Jeannette is allowed to cook hotdogs by herself, resulting in setting her clothes on fire and getting badly burned. After social workers question her parents strongly, its time for another ""skedaddle"" out of that town. She, her older sister Lori, brother Brian and younger sister Maureen, are often hungry. But, Dad insists when some of his brilliant ideas load them up with money, he will build them a special ""glass castle"" to live in. But, when, when? After another sad incident in northern Nevada, Rose Mary insists they move to West Virginia, where Rex grew up, so his folks can help them. What a mistake! Not only are the children's grandparents cold and mean, life goes downhill after they all move into another shack. Therefore, Jeannette tells the kids they are going ""to work"" themselves and save money to get the heck away from their reckless parents. They do, one by one. Back in the present day, Jen and her fiancé clash when meeting Rex and Rose Mary in their ""squat"" housing. Will Jeannette ever be able to break away from her folks? First, dear viewer, this film is a worthy look at pulling oneself up by bootstraps but, for a better story, read the book by Jeannette Walls herself. It is superb. Nevertheless, Larson, Harrelson, Watts and especially the child actors, are all very fine. Despite the grim premise, the movies is also funny as well, and the scenery from the West to the East if great. No, I didn't care for Larson's costumes while Watts looks great even in chaos. That's small potatoes. Don't miss the credits which show the REAL Walls family. Overall, this film is a incisive look at many issues while touching the heart. Can all movies say the same?",The Glass Castle
14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,8 November 2017,"The Glass Castle Dysfunctional families work best when everyone in the family is dysfunctional.Unfortunately, it's only the father in this drama that cannot stay sober.Born and raised in an unstable home environment by her alcoholic father Rex (Woody Harrelson) and her free-spirited mother Rose Mary (Naomi Watts), Jeannette Walls (Brie Larson) and her two siblings struggle to stay sane.Constantly on the move due to their dad's gambling debts and social services, the children are perpetually placated by Rex's flowery promises of a better life just around the corner.Dealing with sensitive subject matter like rape, incest and substance abuse head on, this melodramatic adaptation of Walls' own biography tries too hard to find a silver lining in the oppressive sadness. While the performances are impactful, the Hollywood ending feels as fanciful as one of the father's yarns.Incidentally, alcoholics sacrifice sobriety so their children can someday write a bestselling tell-all.

16,Reno-Rangan,The story of a Mountain Goat!,8,24 January 2018,"This was like a combination of 'Captain Fantastic' and 'Infinitely Polar Bear'. But only a messed up tale than them. It was based on the book of the same name which originally a true story. A fascinating one. Inspiring, as well as heartbreaking story. But a wonderful film for families to watch. Because it focused on the family's unity in the difficult times. Told from a kid's perspective as she was growing up having suffered from basic facilities, along with her siblings.A family with a below poverty level, frequently moving from town to town, making a home in the remote places has one dream that they want to build their own glass castle, particularly for the kids. One of sibling who is close to her father, realises what's going on in the family and tries to find a solution to it. So it takes years to accomplish, and those years were narrated for us with so much fun and emotions.I love this kind of tales, When I came to know it that it was a memoir based, I loved it even more. True stories always reach my heart. This was just like I wanted. Enjoyed every bit of it, especially performances were top notch. One of the highlights was Ella Anderson. Find of the film, despite she has done other decent roles prior to it. Brie's not a great actress, but her choice of films always was the best, hence her part too was good in this.Second feature film for the director, as well as with Brie. He was good though. Not to say anything about Harrelson, one of the under-rated actors of our generation. He should get the Oscar nominee for this role, but that's very unlikely I think. Naomi too has given a memorable performance with the rest of the cast. Forget the runtime, it was so fast and the always to points. Definitely one of the best of the year that must not be missed.8/10",The Glass Castle
17,zkonedog,Extremely Relatable & Challenging At The Same Time,9,24 November 2017,"Everyone comes from somewhere and some family...there is absolutely denying that. While others embrace their family and past, others push it away. ""The Glass Castle"" is a film that deals with all the complexities in between...and does so in a remarkably poignant & thought-provoking manner.For a basic plot summary, this based-on-true-events tale tells the story of Jeannette (Brie Larson), a New York City gossip columnist who clearly (seen right from the get-go) has a troubled relationship with father Rex (Woody Harrelson) & mother Rose Mary (Naomi Watts). With Jeanette now engaged to fiancée David (Max Greenfield), her family and background is thrust back into her life, as she struggles with how much to include them in the proceedings. As the film moves forward, at least half of the 2:07 runtime is comprised of flashbacks to different stages of Jeannette's life growing up with Rex & Rose Mary, giving us viewers a birds-eye view of why ""current Jeannette"" views her parents the way she does.The main reason ""Glass Castle"" works so well as a film is because it is such a relatable concept. While most people's parents are not high-dreaming drunks like Rex or flighty, no-backbone artists like Rose Mary, everyone has that kind of turbulent relationship with their parents as both parties age. Does one look back at childhood with a sense of awe and wonder no matter what the circumstances, or should one hold their parents fully accountable for the many mistakes that are inevitably made along the way? Perhaps it is a little of both? Where does one draw the line? Those are the complex issues that ""Glass Castle"" deals with, and what makes it such an engaging overall experience.It helps that Larson is spot-on (as usual), and Harrelson matches her all the way through. A number of child actors do their jobs admirably, and this helps create a string of continuity that a flashback film like this really needs to succeed. Basically, all the acting is great enough to never let the viewer doubt or question the sincerity of the material.One final interesting observation about ""The Glass Castle"": While I won't give away the ending here, I will say that I believe it will challenge many viewers. Many will not agree with the route taken by Jeanette. However, this being based on real life turns these decisions into avenues for mental exploration for viewers: One can think ""how would I react in this situation?"" or ""what would I do different here?"".Thus, though I was initially wary that ""Glass Castle"" would be kind of a schmaltzy, feel-good, romanticized family drama, what I found instead was a film with a laser-focused message and the acting to back it up. For people who love movies that make them think long and hard about life and relationships, this one will rocket to the top of your favorites list.",The Glass Castle
18,eddie_baggins,One of 2017's hidden gems,9,17 December 2017,"A true case of just ignore the critics, The Glass Castle presents one of the year's most undeservedly mistreated major releases and for anyone that would cast their eye over many of the negative critical responses to director Destin Daniel Cretton's great follow-up to his indie darling Short Term 12 and choose to not see this touching based on a true story, they'd be missing out on one of the year's underseen gems.Based on Jeannette Walls autobiographical book of the same name, The Glass Castle tells the poignant story of Walls life growing up with her siblings under the care of their parental duo in the form of Naomi Watt's artistic and free spirited Rose Mary and most tellingly Woody Harrelson's intellectually attuned, yet troubled and alcoholic father Rex.Telling the story in two era's with both Brie Larson's older and career minded Jeannette struggling to come to grips with her upbringing and her loving yet divisive relationship with her father and Walls as a young girl, being constantly uprooted by her parents lifestyle and frequently letdown by a father that promises much, yet fails to deliver.Over the course of The Glass Castle's two hour runtime we feel a part of the Wall family life, the good, the bad and all that falls in-between and showcasing the eye he has for humanity and relatable human flaws and graces, Cretton is perfectly in tune with his performers and characters as we begin to feel their disappointments, their frustrations and most importantly their bonds.At the heart of Cretton's film also is some fantastic turns from his varied Wall performers and from the young Chandler Hand through to Larson's incarnation, all actors work well to bring Jeannette to life while Rex Walls gives Woody Harrelson one of his meatiest feature film roles in a number of years.After career revivals in Zombieland and HBO's megahit first season of True Detective, Harrelson once more showcases his acting chops in the difficult role of Rex.Flirting the line between despicable drunk to kind-hearted protector, Harrelson delivers an awards worthy turn here and while Cretton's film may not have been taken up by critics or audiences in the way in which The Glass Castle deserved, there's little denying Harrelson's impressive performance is one of the years very best.Final Say - Ignore the overriding critical consensus and you'll find a film full of raw emotion, power and a beautifully constructed human heart. With The Glass Castle Cretton has crafted an emotionally engaging and thought-provoking family drama and one of the year's best dramatic efforts, featuring one of Woody Harrelson's most memorable film roles.4 ½ arm wrestling matches out of 5",The Glass Castle

As the movie opens, we Jeannette, all grown up, is having dinner with her fiancé in New York. On the way home after dinner, she sees her mom and dad, obviously homeless, rummaging the streets of Manhattan. We then go back in time, it's probably the 1950s. Jeannette's mom is busy doing her paintings, so Jeannette is forced to fix lunch for herself, and accidentally sets herself on fire. It's not long before Jeannette's dad decides that her hospital stay has lasted long enough, and he sneaks her out... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you';; just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion between writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton and actress Brie Larson--they did the under-appreciated ""Short Term 12"" together a few years ago. Here they tackle a difficult task, namely how to bring the 2005 iconic memoir of Jeannette Walls to the big screen. I read the memoir, and there is a reason it is considered an absolute classic. It is crucial then to find the right performers for the key roles, and I believe that casting Woody Harrelson in the key role of Rex (Jeannette's crazy and drunk dad) was a mistake, for no other reason than Harrelson (whom I love otherwise) is simply too old for the role (he is mid-50s in real life). But there are other problems too: some of the scenes look so... staged! You can practically hear the director yell ""And... action!"", check out the awkward arm-wrestling match between Rex and David (Jeannette's fiancé). Last, but certainly not least, is that some of the material is so inherently unlikable that it feels wrong seeing it on the big screen (as opposed to reading it, where you can process it in the confines of your own privacy). Each time Rex says ""Things are going to be different this time around"", you just want to slap him straight. On the plus side, there are some terrific performances, none more so than the two actresses who play Jeannette at a younger age. Given the long shadow of the 2005 memoir, maybe no film could ever have done justice to the memoir, who knows. One thing is for sure: this particular movie is an awkward and ultimately disappointing adaptation.""The Glass Castle"" opened wide this weekend, and I really was looking forward to this. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay. Yet I can't see this playing in theaters all that long, to be honest. The movie is simply not that good, and in a few weeks will be buried by other new movies. If you've read the book, approach this with caution, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Glass Castle

It reminds me of Captain Fantastic, but if you seen the movie, The Glass Castle acts a lot like the aftermath of Captain Fantastic as the The Glass Castle goes back and forth from the past of this woman's childhood of being a squatter and loving her father, played by Woody Harrison, to death, but realizing how unstable he and her mom, played by Naomi Watts are to her and her siblings. The movie goes into the present, which is actually 1989 and shows what the kids grew up to be because of their parents.Not a  bad movie, it did not make me sob uncontrollably like the novel seemed to but it was a touching revelation about how much influence our parents have on us despite how different we may be from them .Loved Woody Harrison, Naomi Watts and Brie Larson in that order in the film.",The Glass Castle

24,peterp-450-298716,This film touched me and shows the consequences of alcohol abuse,8,20 December 2017,"""I never built the glass castle.
No. But it was fun to plan it. """"The Glass Castle"" is the film version of a true story that will baffle and mystify you. A film that balances between a romanticized comedy and a serious drama. It's like an adventurous road-movie in which an apparently normal family travel around as nomads. But, ""Apparently normal"" is an understatement, because they lead a rather unusual life. And this thanks to Rex, the pater familias of the Walls family (Woody Harrelson). On the one hand he thoroughly hates everything that smells like capitalism. And on the other hand there's also a serious alcohol problem that causes a number of problems. An addicted man with manic-depressive traits who's planning already for years to build a dream house in the most efficient place (an argument that he uses over and over again when they are moving again for the umpteenth time). This realization involves a futuristic glass house. A house probably as fragile as the family structure in which Jeannette (Ella Anderson / Brie Larson) grew up.Rex Walls is without doubt an intelligent person, but has never used this intelligence in a positive way. Hence the chaotic life with a different destination every other time. From a poor home to spending the night under a starry sky in the desert. Rex and Rose Mary (Naomi Watts) are parents who feel responsible for the welfare of their children, but on the other hand they can not bear that responsibility. Rose Mary is a would-be artist with a hippie look who follows Rex unconditionally and goes along with his illusions. Even though she realizes at certain moments that they aren't exactly leading a normal life, it's still very difficult for her to leave Rex. Sometimes she acts as if she's intoxicated as well.""The Glass Castle"" contains some heavy themes such as raising children, an addiction and the consequences, rebelling against established values in a capitalist community and psychological child abuse. Even though it sometimes feels absurd and light-footed, the whole left an everlasting impression. A family life with well-meaning parents who make everyday life almost impossible. I haven't experienced similar circumstances. But the addiction element is something that touched me personally. It showed in a realistic way how someone's dependency is destructive and how difficult it is to reverse such a process. Despair and guilt were played in a striking way by Woody Harrelson.Woody Harrelson plays his prominent role in a truly brilliant way. For me this was one of the best acting performances of this versatile actor till now. Brie Larson shows in a realistic way how the older Jeanette struggles with her inner feelings. There was this turnaround moment when she realizes that she doesn't belong to the artificial world of the wealthy people and that the imaginary world of her father, she wanted to escape from so desperately, was the place where she felt at home. Perhaps it's a bit too corny, but at the same time it's really touching. The one who made the most impression, however, was Ella Anderson as the young Jeannette. The interactions between Rex and the young Jeannette were the most beautiful film moments. The father with his changing moods opposite that vulnerable girl whose unconditional love for her father is indestructible.Even though it's not explicitely about alcohol, I think this is the common thread throughout the film. I'm convinced that alcohol is the structural cause of the totally disrupted family situation and the reason for all kinds of incidents. Rex realizes that his family doesn't get the regular life that they actually deserve because of his drinking problem. And when his favorite daughter asks the ultimate question to quit drinking, there's that pained and guilt-soaked look. Most will see this parental behavior as unheard and irresponsible. But remember that an alcohol addict is trapped in a hard-to-flee compulsion pattern and most of times doesn't have control over his behavior. However, I fear the film isn't a reflection of how the situation was in reality.",The Glass Castle

28,eric262003,The Best Role Models Are Yourselves,8,6 August 2018,"The Glass Castle"" based on actual events is based off the the best-selling memoir Jeanette Walls and about her unusual and unorthodox upbringing by her parents (Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts). Rex and Rose Mary Walls were a fiercely nomadic married couple of four children, three daughters and a son. Though the family's life is built around freedom of convention, regulations and materialism around the house, they're dependent on striving towards their own individual endeavours which includes to appreciate learning, love of nature, for exploring the facets of life and for living in utopia like pipe dreams.That might sound good on paper, but in the real world, there's a cornucopia of drawbacks for this kind of free-thinking environment they live in. The family is constantly migrating from one home to another making them feel alienated by people around them. Their schooling is no properly fundamental, sure they're home-schooled, but not under educational restrictions. Even food, shelter, heating, air conditioning is very scarce to total deprivation. To make matters worse, Rex is a chronic inebriate with a temper to match which is the perfect catalyst for empathy over ideology. His idea of education is through living and everything else is bull, contrary to the ""swim or sink"" lessons we've learned in school. In spite of being an alcoholic and a dreamer, he is quite naturally intelligent with a gift of engineering. However, his ideological beliefs and carefree demeanour counterbalances between being unmotivated and depressed and his inner manifestations leads him to drink. For Rose Mary her ambitions is to be an artist, her real work embellishes the film. Her dreams are there, but her drive is absent and her reality check comes into play as she neglects to the people who need her the most.Like youth, adults can build their lifestyles off of dreams, even settling in a condemned home that's deprived of indoor plumbing labeled as the metaphoric ""glass castle"" (hence the title). Sure it seems exciting that the children live in a world in which they are free to be themselves, only drawback is the societal norms and reality does come by and that the parents need to at times get their heads out of those clouds. It comes to point where the kids need to be self taught if their parents won't provide the nurture for them. Sure it's all right to dream, but if it becomes more a part of your life it becomes more self-serving and careless to the breaking point that Rex and Rose Mary might be unfit to raise their children.Under the direction of Destin Daniel Cretton he directed a brilliant nuanced story complimented by an ensemble of well-versed performances. Along with veteran performers like Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts, Brie Larson is showing that super stardom is inches away. She's shown her acting in chops in her Oscar winning performance in ""Room"" and here as Jeanette she's turning in one great performance after another. The other actors who play their kids from different ages were wonderful too especially provocative was Ella Anderson who played Jeanette at the age of 11. And yes like all family themed stories, ""The Glass Castle"" has its moments of laughter, tears, fear and tragedy along with the more material moments that are light, dark, high, low, triumph and failure.And sure the characters had their imperfections, but who doesn't? Sure dreamers understand other dreamers, but Rex makes his dreaming more complex being that his ambitions should have been put to help instead it hurt the people around him. Aside from the movie there features various extras that you might enjoy including nine deleted scenes, a half-hour feature an intriguing interview with the real Jeanette Walls and a great behind the scenes footage of the song ""Summer Sonf"" by Rex Walls.",The Glass Castle
29,nancyldraper,Incredible performances,7,4 September 2021,"This is not an easy movie to watch but it must have been a brutal life to live. Based on Jeannette Watts' memoir, by the same name, this is a beautifully performed production. All the headliners (Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts) were superb but the performance by the child actors are what really sold the picture. Already a bestseller for 2 years after it was published, the book once again rose to the top of the New York Bestsellers list upon the release of the movie, and, I understand why. The movie made me want to get closer to the source material. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Drama}",The Glass Castle
30,bandw,Truth or fiction?,2,11 September 2018,"This is based on a memoir by Jeannette Walls and, given that,
I would expect most scenes to be believable.
However, I found it hard to believe that things
happened as presented in so many scenes.For examle, early on Jeanette's family (father Rex,
mother Rose, and their four young daughters) is travelling in
an old beat-up 1955 Ford when Rex decides give vent to some sense
of defiant freedom by veering off the road, crashing through a fence
and hooting and hollering as he drives hundreds of yards into a
dessicated southwestern landscape. Having gotten his family stuck in
the middle of nowhere Rex says how great it is--they can camp out
there and have a great view of the stars when the sun goes down.
In the meantime Rose has found a fascinating Joshua tree that, being
an artist, she must paint immediately. How would such a scene 
ultimately end? Somehow they would have to get the car out of there
and have it repaired--at what price freedom, huh? And, in their
apparent destitution, where will they get the money to get the car
back on the highway? This scene set the mood for the whole movie
for me, showing Rex to be an irresponsible ass with some idealistic
sense of freedom that allows him to put himself above less
liberated souls. And this is Rex at his best, he only gets worse
as the movie goes along and we become familiar with the depths
of his alcoholism.I give the movie credit in its convincing presentation of Rex as being a
troubled drunk with little redeeming value.
What I could not understand was how
any of his family could tolerate him for a second. However he apparently
had some quality that the family on occassion would find 
appealing, a quality that was totally lost on me. Unfortunately for
my being able to appreciate this movie,
Rex's appeal was at the heart of the family dynamic.Most all scenes are amped up for maximum emotional response and the music
cues us as to how we should respond. In one scene Rex returns home
from a drunk with a six inch gash in his arm and he coaches his
daughter to put in stitches while he braves the pain with no
anesthetic. Really? No
antiseptic even? What does Rex do when he turns up with a major infection?
He could not possibly lower himself to go to an emergency room
in a hospital that is there primarily to put money into the pockets
of rich doctors.In an emotional final scene Rex presents Jeanette with a scrap book 
where he has
saved every piece of her writing. Given the total chaos of the family's
vagabond lifestyle and Rex's inability to focus on anything long enough
to push it through, introducing this unbelievable scrap book 
antic for a purely emotional punch at the end of Rex's life was 
insulting to me.For a movie that is supposed to be somewhat autobiographical this had
more the feeling of fiction than of truth.",The Glass Castle

It could be a truly horrendous childhood someone is running away from and they can be still dealing with the damage. This is a movie about self- discovery as Larson is the grown-up Jeannette Walls who never took the time to objectively assess her childhood's impact on her life. Then again, who among us ever has? Hers was just a miserable life of neglect by an alcoholic father and a mother who escaped life through painting. Her pain is compounded by her constant disappointment over her father's promises that he could never seem to keep. But, when she got over her anger and disappointment she was finally able to accept herself as she really was. So, it's true, it's never too late to have a happy childhood. Catch it.

34,cultfilmfan,The Glass Castle,10,16 August 2017,"I remember reading Jeannette Walls' memoir back in 2012. A good friend had given it to me as a gift because he himself had read it and liked it very much and thought that I would too. At the time that I read, The Glass Castle, it was either the Fall, or Winter of that year and I remember that during that year I was dealing particularly with some unwanted anxiety and depression issues which were mostly situational issues and yet nevertheless they were there. As, I read this memoir, I found myself appreciating it and yet perhaps because of the fragile emotional state I was in where any little thing could bring about a strong anxiety attack, or racing thoughts, I found the book a difficult read not because it was overly academic, or anything of that kind, but instead because of the high emotional intensity of the book and the themes that the book ran on which in this case was a true story about a girl growing up in an extremely dysfunctional family. I remember whilst reading the book that I became almost exasperated at the two parental figures in the book and why they chose two live the way they did and why so much trauma and difficulties were thrust upon their young children at such a young and impressionable age. I haven't read the book since then as usually I will finish one book and then jump right into another with me very seldomly returning to a book to reread it, but one thing that stuck out about the book to me and it becomes even more apparent now that I have seen the film version of The Glass Castle, is that basically we are dealing with two parental figures who for reasons either of their own choosing, or perhaps some like other things were maybe situational as well. Needless to say they did not want to live a swanky, posh lifestyle and give their kids everything handed to them on a silver platter. These kids really had to witness a lot of difficult and what I would consider traumatic life changing things as they were growing up in the Walls' family household including alcoholism, poverty and going without daily necessities such as food as well as the fact that their father, Rex, could almost be really friendly and warm one minute, but in the next be the exact polar opposite and could come on strong, intimidating and even down right scary and mean. The alcohol he consumed any chance he had probably did not help this and there were often many family arguments and things that could get so tense and uncomfortable that you could probably cut the thick dense air around them with a butter knife. One element that is really rewarding to watch amiss the dysfunction is how these young kids really stuck together and would defend one another and more, or less made a pact between one another to always be there for each other because I think that even at a young age they knew that their family dynamics were not in the least bit what you would call ""normal"" and that to survive that they would have to make it on their own and be self sufficient and be able to provide for themselves and also each other. While, I was at times incredulous with these two parents while I read the book and also watched this new film, I have to say that the film also gave the story a new light to the subject in my eyes as while it showed the unhealthy living conditions of this family and what to most children would have caused irreparable psychological damage, the film also shows us that while living like this certainly wasn't easy for any of them that because of their surroundings they all grew up to be perfectly functioning and capable people who were not hindered because of their upbringing, but instead grew all the more strong because of it and truly learned to persevere and stay strong in the midst of whatever storms came their way. The film also showcases that while Rex Walls in particular was a terrifying figure at times and a true nonconformist and yet he had his own personal demons and troubles to deal with and even if he had an odd way of showing it, he really did love these kids with all his heart and that no matter what happened nothing would change that. And, I think also as the kids became adults they could put aside the troubling and bad times and remember everything that was good because there were certainly those moments as well. This film version of The Glass Castle, is top notch in each and every way possible and while it can not include each and every moment of the book, what it does leave us with is quite memorable. The acting here is beyond phenomenal from the young child actors to greats like Brie Larson and Woody Harrelson, who I sincerely hope are both up for Oscars for their powerful and moving performances. This is a film that hits you quite hard emotionally, but at the same time is a completely rewarding experience that made me appreciate the book even more, but also gave me a different look at this family and dysfunction in general with even a sense of acceptance and love towards this family. This is the most powerful and moving film of the year so far and also with the best performances so far this year. A true masterpiece in each and every sense of the word.",The Glass Castle

36,dave-mcclain,Extremely unpleasant and with almost no entertainment value whatsoever.,1,13 August 2017,"In the classic 1990 holiday comedy ""Home Alone"", Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom) tells Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin), ""How you feel about your family is a complicated thing."" I'd say that's true for most of us. No matter how uneventful our upbringing or how close we currently are with our family members, there always seems to be unresolved issues. Of course, significant issues in our childhoods lead to complicated feelings as adults. That has certainly been the case for writer Jeanette Walls. The former newspaper writer turned author endured a nomadic, poverty-stricken childhood, carved out a life for herself which was diametrically opposed to how she was raised and then had to come to terms with her dysfunctional parents and her complicated memories from her youth. She chronicled that journey in her 2005 best-seller, which spawned 2017's ""The Glass Castle"" (PG-13, 2:07).To say Jeanette Walls had a difficult childhood is like saying that the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign was kind of divisive. Jeanette (played in flashbacks by Ella Anderson and Chandler Head) is the second of four children raised by Rex and Rose Mary Walls (Oscar nominees Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts). Rex acts like an overgrown hippie. His attitude is summed up well when he tells Jeanette, ""Rich city folks live in fancy apartments with their air so polluted they can't even see the stars. We'd be out of our minds to trade places with any one of them."" He loves his children on an emotional level, but does a terrible job of showing it on a practical one. He constantly indulges his drinking and smoking habits, but often can't afford food for his family. He can't hold a job, he avoids all financial responsibilities and he often moves his family from place to place – and in most of the places they live, they're squatting. Jeanette's mother isn't much better at parenting. She loves to paint and manages to do that in spite of her children often not knowing where their next meal is coming from. She gets frustrated with Rex, but she enables Rex's alcoholism and resists leaving him, even though he's emotionally and sometimes physically abusive towards his family. Meanwhile, their three daughters and one son are simply stuck.As an adult (in scenes that take place in the early 1990s – the ""present"" in this film), Jeanette (Oscar winner Brie Larson) has become one of those ""rich city folks in fancy apartments."" She's a successful writer living in New York City with her fiancé, an investment banker named David (Max Greenfield). By this point, her three siblings have also settled in the Big Apple, as have their parents who are squatting in an abandoned building. Jeanette says she's happy with her fiancé and her job, and she seems to be, but her face also seems to betray a deep inner conflict regarding what she really wants in life – and how she feels about her parents. Early in the film, she drives past the two of them picking through trash, pretending not to see them. That incident launches her into a series of flashbacks in which we see her childhood play out (including a recurring subplot of her father drawing up plans for the titular dwelling, an energy-efficient house full of windows, which his children help him plan, but increasingly doubt will ever be built). In Jeanette's present, she struggles to come to terms with her upbringing, while her relationship with her siblings and her parents grow, change and move towards some sort of resolution.""The Glass Castle"" is difficult to watch – and not in a good way. The film is similar to 2016's ""Captain Fantastic"" (and includes a couple of the same child actors), but that one was somewhat entertaining. Movie Fans will marvel at the irresponsibility, neglect and even abuse on the part of these parents, and wonder how the kids survived, let alone felt any affection for them. In its synopsis, Rotten Tomatoes calls this movie ""a remarkable story of unconditional love"", but people who see it will be forced to consider whether these parents deserved such devotion and whether their children are foolish for trying to give it. This story is really more about resilience, while the experience of watching it is more like an endurance test. A few times, I found myself briefly closing my eyes, not because I was tired, or even because of any specific images on the screen, but because I simply didn't want to watch these characters anymore. Only my integrity as a reviewer kept me in my seat, but even that was tested. Hearing fingernails dragged across an old chalkboard is more pleasant than enduring this film. Director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton should never be allowed to bring another book to the screen. The book includes more interesting stories and more emotional levels than this adaptation. Cretton chooses to oversimplify Jeanette's life and focuses mainly on the depressing point of how bad her parents were. Only impressive performances by the main actors keep this movie from being completely unwatchable – and it's still a close call. ""D""",The Glass Castle

My Rating 10/10
I'm so grateful a friend recommended this fine film as it was one of those movies that slipped under the radar for me.I'm fascinated by films about dysfunctional families and addiction probably because I see similarities with my own but this family made me feel very grateful even though there were similarities but also a lot of differences.The most recent film on a dysfunctional family ""Hillbilly Elegy "" in my opinion doesn't come anywhere near the quality of ""The Glass Castle."" but got all the publicity and fanfare.The story is based on Jeannette Walls' 2005 best-selling memoir of the same name. The story is based on her childhood, where her family lived in poverty and sometimes as squatters. The film stars Brie Larson as Jeannette Walls who is perfectly cast in this difficult sensitive role. Naomi Watts is also wonderful cast as her artist mother Rose Mary who seems so detached from the reality and havoc plus trauma that her husband Rex's Alcoholism and Adult child immaturity had caused to her family. Much of which is the result of his own intergenerational neglect and sexual abuse .Naomi Watts is a splendid actress ,who doesn't seem to get the same attention as her friend Nicole Kidman and others ,perhaps she doesn't want it but her versatility in challenging roles like this and her recent magnificent performance in ""Penguin Bloom""convince me she is equal to any of the fine movie actresses around today.Woody Harrelson as Rex gives a superb portrayal of a victim of abuse and addiction and portrays a Father and husband who fails dismally to be breadwinner and yet is forgiven time and again and enabled by his loyal wife .He is intelligent but deluded by a classic superiority/inferiority complex and tries to sober up by himself stopping drinking for a short time but can't stay stopped.Brie Larson is perfectly cast as Jeannette the eldest daughter and apple of her dysfunctional fathers eye. Her character relates the story of her childhood and eventual escape from poverty and neglect to a successful literary career in New York where she meets her fiancée David ( Max Greenfield).It was so interesting to see Australian actress Sarah Snook in a very effective role as

The mother is an artist, the father is an alcoholic and a dreamer who seems to refuse societies norms at the expense of his children. Both parents neglected their children equally and they are frequently on the run from their debts.The father tries to instill his style of independence on the family to such an extent that they are denied basic human necessities such as a stable home environment, food, water, and an education. Frequent flash-backs show how the children's lives and personalities have been shaped by the lifestyle they are forced to follow.Near the end, we discover that the parents had inherited some land many years before that could have been sold to provide substantial financial security, yet they still chose to live in poverty. At the very end of the film the father dies and the family come together to reminisce over the 'good times', this is unnecessarily cheesy and I found hard to believe. Stay for the credits to see photos and videos of the actual people the film is based.",The Glass Castle
40,Andres-Camara,"Está bien, pero le falta algo. It's fine, but it's missing something",6,16 June 2018,"¿A qué me refiero? Pues a que la película es buena, de eso no hay duda, pero una película con una historia así, debería poner en ciertos momentos la piel de gallina y no lo consigue. Creo que es por tu forma de hacerla para llegar al corazón. Pierde fuerza y aparte por su manera de rodar.No conozco el libro y por lo tanto no lo he leído. No sé si la historia es así, imagino que sí, pero a mí estas películas de perdón, me dejan mal. A una persona como ese padre que se gana por derecho propio que todos sus hijos le desprecien y no quieran saber nada de él, no sé por qué hay que redimirlo y menos por haber hecho alguna cosa buena, que por defecto, debería haber hecho.Me parece que los actores están todos estupendos, pero eso es lógico, con ese elenco es difícil que esta faceta este mal. Desde el más pequeño hasta el último, hacen unos papeles impresionantes.No me gusta el cambio final de Brie, no creo que tenga que darle esa parte de culpabilidad.En esta película la peluquería, maquillaje y vestuario tienen un papel fundamental. Están todos esplendidos. Te ayudan a que te creas todos los personajes completamente.La iluminación está muy bien. Es bonita y te ayuda a meterte en la historia. Si bien algunas partes deberían haber sido más frías.El director, lleva la película hacia delante, si, el problema es que tira más por un camino sensiblero y eso la hace peor. No sabe poner la cámara para ganar en todos los aspectos, solo cuenta la historia desde fuera. Pero por lo menos la cuenta y no te aburre.No se si no habría ganado más si el montaje fuese distinto. Hay veces que tanto volver hace decaer la película. A lo mejor debería haber contado todo lo anterior más junto.Es una buena recomendación.
What do I mean? Well, the film is good, there's no doubt about it, but a movie with a story like that, should give goose bumps at certain moments and it does not work. I think it's because of the way you do it to get to the heart. Loses strength and apart by his way of rolling.I do not know the book and therefore I have not read it. I do not know if history is like that, I guess so, but to me these movies of forgiveness, they leave me badly. To a person like that father who earns in his own right that all his children despise him and do not want to know anything about him, I do not know why he has to be redeemed and less for having done something good, which by default, he should have done.I think the actors are all great, but that is logical, with that cast it is difficult that this facet is wrong. From the smallest to the last, they make some impressive roles.I do not like the final change of Brie, I do not think I have to give him that part of guilt.In this film hairdressing, makeup and costumes have a fundamental role. They are all splendid. They help you to create all the characters completely.The lighting is very good. She's pretty and helps you get into the story. While some parts should have been colder.The director, takes the film forward, yes, the problem is that it throws more down a maudlin path and that makes it worse. He does not know how to put the camera to win in all aspects, only tells the story from the outside. But at least it counts and it does not bore you.I do not know if I would not have won more if the assembly was different. There are times when so much to return causes the film to decay. Maybe I should have told all the above more together.It is a good recommendation",The Glass Castle
41,Alexander_Blanchett,A mixed bag,7,11 October 2017,"On one hand it is very moving and moved me deeply on the other hand it was very clichéd and predictable. But generally a good film that is worth to see and to be seen. The film mostly works due to its great performances. Brie Larson is fantastic. Especially in the flashbacks but constantly through the entire film she delivers a perfect performance. On the one hand she is like Cinderella in a world she does not fit in and on the other hand she is the vulnerable girl who tries to escape the tragedy of her life. But is it really a tragedy? Thats what the film explores and it does it very well. Besides the fabulous Larson there is Woody Harrelson who delivers one of his finest and most versatile performances of the last years. You never know if you should like him or not or how he really ticks. Harrelson plays the role with a lot of different facets. Naomi Watts was a bit disappointing. She had a great character at hand but overplayed it and was too over the top at times and not always very believable. The film is like a dark ""Captain Fantastic"". Direction wise it was good. Maybe too many flashbacks, which were needed but still stretched the film as I thought the relationship between adult Jeanette and her father was more interesting than between kid Jeanette and her father. I also hoped director Destin Daniel Cretton would be brave in regards showing the really dark aspects of the past. But generally it delivers and gives you a bittersweet feeling about nostalgia. It also is about the true values of life. I did leave the cinema being moved so it worked for me for most parts.",The Glass Castle

44,coreyjdenford,Cracks appear,6,6 October 2017,"This review of The Glass Castle is spoiler free*** (3/5)BEFORE BRIE LARSON gained a well-praised Oscar win for her emotionally powerful performance in 2015s Room, she appeared in writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton's second feature 2013's film festival favourite Short Term 12 where she played as Grace a twentysomething supervising staff member of a residential treatment facility. A film which gave her almost unanimous praise from critics and awards alike. After her Oscar she was awarded with blockbuster success in this year's Kong: Skull Island and a chance to play the title role in MCU's Captain Marvel. However before that she returns to Cretton for his latest The Glass Castle.Based upon Jeanette Walls' best-selling memoirs of the same name we have Larson starring as the grown-up Jeanette, a twentysomething writer working for a magazine in New York meanwhile happily living with her Fiancé (Max Greenfield), however, this soon transpires that she is using this look as a shield to hide away from her dysfunctional childhood. There are a few well-placed flashbacks showing her childhood living with her father, Rex (Woody Harrelson) an illiterate alcoholic who teaches his children the ways of life instead of taking them to school, he tells them stories to stir their imagination as hope for a distraction to their poverty. Her mother Rose (Naomi Watts) is an eccentric artist who much like Rex paints what she sees and instead of looking after her children she tries to paint a masterpiece. This leaves Jeanette, the second eldest child to cook and to clean this leaves her physically scarred. The family are constantly on the move from place-to-place desperately trying to avoid the government and tax payments.The flashbacks are the films shining light forming most of the story as Cretton directs each form of Jeanette from young child (Chandler Head) through her pre-teen years (Ella Anderson) to Larson's adolescent and adult Jeanette swiftly and smoothly moving his camera along each memory. Whether it's her father promising to do something for her or tearfully listening to one of his stories he captures each of them in glistening form. Unfortunately some of the flashbacks fail to grasp the imagination of Jeanette Walls' memoirs as a lot of the fail to securely transfer to the grown woman Larson plays in the present which makes her character sadly flawed utterly grading with her performance. Also it's both seemingly too tidy and too messy, and at the same time neither quite wild nor quite sensible enough making it a sadly more forgettable venture in Larson's powerful filmography. That said The Glass Castle is a subtle and utterly sweet drama which just about often enough breathes into raucous life. VERDICT On the one hand The Glass Castle is a tidy poignant drama with refined performances and on the other it's a flawed tale which often fails to grasp Walls' memories on the screen.",The Glass Castle
45,kaptenvideo-89875,Dark and intriguing family drama with another tour de force performance by Woody Harrelson.,8,16 August 2017,"Based on a true story about a family on the run from the government, often hiding in small towns and living in poverty. The central character is Jeannette (Brie Larson), oldest of four siblings, but the story's really about their brilliant but tormented father (Woody Harrelson) who's the main reason the family can't settle down and, even worse, the children often have to take care of themselves. Also starring, Naomi Watts as the artistic but equally careless mother. I am a bit surprised by the low scores the movie has received – 5.8 by Metacritic users and 56 by critics, 49% by Rotten Tomatoes critics. I felt that The Glass Castle"" is a superb family drama, ensemble movie, and character study, not to mention one of the more enjoyable cinema experiences I've had recently, despite grim topics explored. The 127 minutes fly by, because you can't help but be mesmerized by the tour de force performance Woody Harrelson has to offer. You could say he's offering his usual but this can't be a bad thing if the result is acting so powerful as Harrelson has been known for at least 10 years – mixing brutality with tenderness, good spirits and humor with sharpness and undeniably strong presence, thus being able to steal or own most scenes he appears in. The man's been nominated for Oscar twice already (1996's The People vs. Larry Flint"" and 2009's The Messenger"") but this is the time he can't be ignored anymore by the American Film Academy can he? This sure feels like a greatest hits of what Harrelson has to give as a thespian, and he's dedicated to bring out every nuance his intriguing character has to offer. If he's not nominated the next year, there's no justice in the world anymore! The cast is actually really good all around, bringing the wide-ranging family dynamics to screen in subtle but very moving and real way. Even Watts as a loyal wife is mentionworthy, in a role which often turns out too thin and decorative. Especially for her after having had enough such petty roles already. The Good Castle"" is a great movie for memorable female roles altogether. Brie Larson reminds us once again why she's one of the most interesting and able actresses of her generation. She always plays the second fiddle to Harrelson but she has an intriguing character as well, able to display both fragility and strength – an Oscar nom for her, too, perhaps? Also, Ella Anderson as the younger version of the oldest sister is very compelling, offering one of the most memorable child performances of recent times. Beside all the quality acting, The Glass Castle"" comes across as interesting social commentary about how much and how exactly the parents should support their offspring to help them become resourceful and resilient members of future society. Sure, the Walls family can be a sobering reminder of how bad some kids have it, which also influences their future potential chances and successes. But in a way, their methods are also a refreshing antidote to excessive and needless pampering widespread today, which is dangerous in the long run, because the minions grow up to become useless burden with a lots of false sense of entitlement. All's not great, though. The ending gets unnecessarily mushy and kills some of the charm the movie had before. It has garnered its fair share of criticisms. But it's not a death blow to nullify all the effort that has gone into otherwise a very fine experience. I almost wish it was a longer story, I enjoyed it so much. Following 2013's acclaimed indie drama Short Term 12"", this is Larson's second collaboration with the director Destin Daniel Cretton. She and Woody Harrelson also both starred in 2011's mediocre thriller/drama Rampart"". ""The Glass Castle"" may have turned out a very different movie with the original cast choices staying intact. Larson came to replace Jennifer Lawrence, Harrelson and Watts to replace Mark Ruffalo and Clare Danes. But in any case, it's a grim and noteworthy drama, and a real actors' movie, ready to showcase their talents whoever's filling the roles. Resulting in one of my favorite movies of 2017 thus far.",The Glass Castle
46,PipAndSqueak,oh yawn,3,7 October 2017,"This film manages to signal that, somewhere, there is a proper story whilst simultaneously failing to depict one. At a snails pace, we learn that Jeanette's father was probably sexually molested by his mother and seems to respond to this by becoming a dreaming fantasist who talks the talk but fails to act...other than to run off and avoid his responsibilities. Nevertheless, he tries to teach Jeanette how to deal with fear by putting her in the deep end of danger and letting her sink or swim....literally. This, apparently, is a good thing. Jeanette rebels and signs up for a different, settled life, with a finance whizz kid and his life of smoke and mirrors. So, she chooses a version of what she already knows but then suddenly has a moment of insight and chooses to go out on her own, to a freelance life that she has been raised to believe is normal.

Harrelson does a great job as a drunk veteran living on the underbelly of America, moving around the country, one step ahead of his creditors and dragging an ever-growing family with him. It is a movie about failure and redemption. Probably one of the worst date movies ever made. Definitely a chick flick.",The Glass Castle

Need strong nerves and willpower to make it through this one.Given the subject matter and how it is portrayed I'm not sure how to rate this movie. It's not possible to give an accurate rating of a movie that retells the traumatic events that occurred in someone's life, especially when the movie is based on a book. The best I can do is share the content of the movie. People will have to decide for themselves whether or not they watch it.-3 stars: For the MANY alternating scenes showing the past and present through the WHOLE movie. The scenes last several minutes so it is easy to identify what is past and present. If you do not like movies that alternate from past to present absolutely avoid this movie because it will drive you mad how many times the movie skips back and forth. I can't remember the last time I was annoyed by alternating time shifts in a movie. By the last half hour I was SO over the skipping back and forth that I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.CONTENT ADVISORY: there is some foul, abusive language, some demoralizing ""cutting"" type of remarks and abusive words. Video of items within a house being destroyed by the abusive father. Sounds of items being destroyed off camera with yelling and screaming by the father at the mother. Lead character Jeannette is shown accidentally setting her dress on fire as a small girl while cooking with a gas stove. Her mother quickly puts out the fire. Her ""burned"" skin is shown a short time later. Later in the movie she deters a drunk from raping her by partially undressing and showing him her severely scarred body. With underwear & bra visible she says the scarring is worse down lower beneath her underwear.Strong insinuation several times of child sexual abuse by the grandmother against her son and grandson. Grandmother physically and verbally abusive. Heavy alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. Father shown violently detoxing from alcohol while tied to a bed at home and being verbally abusive. Father and mother living as grifters who don't pay their debts, trespassing on private property as squatters along with their children. Few physical altercations shown and aftermath also shown on the father who is literally stitched up by Jeannette. Throughout the movie the children complain of being hungry and the parents not able to feed them, but the dad always has money for alcohol and cigarettes. At times the movie is hard to watch because it is well acted and portrayed.

49,austin0731,misguided and misleading,6,30 September 2017,"Since ""Room"", Brie Larson seems to be struggling to reclaim that spark that she had. While she gave a solid performance in ""Kong: Skull island"" and is now looking to be part of the MCU as Captain Marvel she hasn't kept such a great track record. ""The Glass Castle"" marks another mediocre film that Larson is a part of since ""Room"". However that's not to say that she performed poorly in ""the glass castle"", in fact she did pretty well with the material that she's got. Woody Harrelson also stars in The glass castle as the father to Larson's character, Harrelson who also gave a relatable performance seems to be doing very well recently playing secondary characters but playing them very well. So, about the movie itself, I found many parallels with a film released earlier this year, ""Captain Fantastic"". But, ""the glass castle never really captures that spark that made me enjoy ""Captain Fantastic"" so much more than this film. While both films deal with odd family dynamics and internal struggles ""The glass castle"" just feels like it takes this idea to another extreme.While in ""Captain Fantastic"" the cast of children learn and grow through their alternate lifestyle in ""the glass castle"", they rummage through trash piles as their father attempts to convince them of a beautiful future. In truth, they are rummaging through trash piles and are going nowhere because this father character, he's a deadbeat and has pretty much no redeeming factors to him. To me ""the glass castle"" glorifies this lifestyle and while I can't say that it is wrong I certainly don't stand by the film's choice to portray this story this way. The film makes it seem like a child's imagination and hope can make up for these poor living conditions but it just doesn't really work. The film paints of picture that this father is such a great man where in truth, I don't see it at all. To me, the film's direction is misguided on the whole. But, there are redeeming factors, the acting was pretty good and the first act of the story before we learn that the film isn't really going anywhere is alright also. It is when we fit the later parts of the movie do we come to realize that the audience like the characters in the movie are just 'not going anywhere'. Is there a message hidden somewhere in here, perhaps but the narrative and execution simply does not bring it out in a meaningful or understandable way.",The Glass Castle

52,bastille-852-731547,Well-Acted--but Otherwise Mediocre--Drama,6,21 August 2017,"I went to see this because I'm a fan of the cast. This film is a small and often depressing drama about a woman who grew up in a nomadic, impoverished family with an alcoholic and abusive father. Brie Larson plays the protagonist (as an adult,) and her parents are played by Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts.The performances in this film are generally quite strong. Larson gives an emotional performance as the lead actress, bringing a lot of grit and tenacity to the role. Harrelson successfully treads a fine line playing an erratic and unstable character. Watts--while underused to some extent--does a good job playing the wife, who is shown as a complex and multi-dimensional character well beyond the traditional and generic ""wife"" characterization often used in feature films. While the acting (and cinematography) are impressive, the film's narrative is very flawed. The film's tone often feels melodramatic and souped-up rather than truly emotionally powerful. This tone is, without a doubt, the film's Achilles heel. Such a problem with the tone is evident throughout the film, as many scenes in the film's first half seem primarily designed to generate a standard response from an audience than portray something--or depict any thoughtful critique--about the characters. The second half of the film is generally an improvement, until the story builds to a cop-out of an ending. Worth a watch due to the acting, but wait to rent it. 6.5/10",The Glass Castle

56,themovieparadise,Phenomenal Storytelling and Performances,9,21 August 2017,"One of The Glass Castle's strongest aspects is how it takes an experience unique to a small amount of people, and makes it so relatable to the masses. 99% of the people watching this movie have not had an upbringing like Jeanette's, but the film crafts the story in a way that you can form parallels to your own life. This isn't just telling the story of someone's childhood; it becomes a commentary on the ups and downs of family life itself. And that's where The Glass Castle becomes something more profound. Some may have seen this relatability as a simplification of child abuse. But I would disagree. The movie never painted what happened in the film as a good thing. It never tried to spin that the parents for justified for how they chose to raise their kids. Instead, they showed that, when you boil it all down, the dysfunction between Jeanette and her parents stem from the same place as other people's parental issues. Instead of isolating the audience by showing us something completely and utterly foreign to us, they chose to make it relatable so that we could draw comparisons to our own lives...",The Glass Castle

I loved the nature of the characters and the story that it told, but it makes you absolutely feel for the kids.On one hand, they got this upbringing that showed them that the world is so much more than dollars and things, but at the same time deprived them of what some may call a ""traditional"" upbringing. There were moments in the film where you absolutely wanted to reach through the screen and ""rescue"" the children, but then there were parts that you realize...maybe I'm the one who needs saving. I need saving from the cookie-cutter life that I'm living, maybe I need to more open to adventure and the idea of finding more out of life.

My parents were at a loss at what to do with me, as I aspired to go to college, and they couldn't afford it. I should add, my parents were never dysfunctional or abusive as those in this film. It's remarkable that Jeanette managed to overcome her obstacles, and people who lived near her in Welch have attested to the condition in which the family lived.I, like many others, managed to get an education....by hard work!, and a MA degree to boot. The main idea that is impressive about this film is the courage it took to break away from the oppressive nature of living in poverty in Appalachia. People say, ""just move away,"" but the hold is very strong. It's implanted generationally. Part of the Appalachian tradition.Also, I must add, the parental psychological abuse featured in the book and in this film is hard to digest, making the overcoming all the more impressive.",The Glass Castle
59,Stoshie,I Guess I'm Hard-Hearted,5,15 July 2019,"This movie didn't move me much at all. I'm not sure what I was supposed to feel after the movie was over. Was I supposed to feel sympathetic toward the father? No, I didn't. Since he was the main focus of the film, it lost me right there.Sure, it's great that the kids survived their childhood without major psychological damage (that we know of), and that one of them became a fairly well-known author. Still not enough to make me care much. I could have done without the oversentimental last part of the movie, too. I might have liked it better if it were, say an hour and forty minutes long instead of over two hours. The last half hour was painful for me to sit through.I can understand why Jeanette Walls, as a writer, would have written a memoir about her childhood. It might have been a bit cathartic for her to do so, too. But I would bet there are a thousand other similar stories out there, not all with such happy endings. Did it need to be made into a movie? In my opinion, no.A similar true-life movie that I liked better was ""The Poker House"", even though it has a lower rating on IMDB. It wasn't really all that good, either, but it had better overall performances in it, including one by a then-unknown Jennifer Lawrence. The performances in ""The Glass House"" seemed wooden to me; none of the acting stood out, none of the characters really grabbed me or made me care about them. With one huge exception: I thought Woody Harrelson was excellent. He's an underrated actor, in my opinion. He was able to inject nuance and believability into his character.

The film may not be up to some people's wants - there is not enough time to tell the whole story. Four children born into a very dysfunctional family. An eccentric mother who probably should not have had children, married to an alcoholic dreamer - and a talker of his dreams. BUT neither take good care of the children and the children end up raising themselves. I have always felt that all families are dysfunctional - with varying levels of function. Woody's character has many issues from his childhood and only one is made known. He has many demons to fight and mostly he doesn't fight - he dreams. I am not a fan of Woody Herrelson however this is a good role for him. I am most impressed with the acting of the younger cast - to be able to show the real emotions of those siblings - well done.

62,trevor-82944,A Roller-coaster Experience in More Ways Than One,6,11 August 2017,"We usually prefer to think of ourselves as better off without our family, taking on trials by ourselves. The 2005 memoir by Jeannette Walls proves to us otherwise: we need our family more than we can ever realize, no matter what turmoil they may put us through. While The Glass Castle certainly means well in execution, this literary adaptation still pales in comparison to the book.Director Destin Daniel Cretton wrote the script, along with Andrew Lanham, both relatively new to the art of screen writing. However the blame for the feature's weak service to Jeannette lands more on the imbalanced editing by the Oscar-nominated Moonlight editor Nat Sanders. He made little clarity as to where or when you were in time, the only indicator being the actress playing the main character. Even then, by the third act, hardly anything useful tells you when you are in time, as the makeup artists did nothing to let you know of anybody's age. So consequently, it became harder to connect with Jeannette in her adult years. Obviously, the time-jumping narrative structure here worked a lot more fluidly on paper.Director Cretton did little to communicate the book's intention with the lack of screen control, resorting for the most part on a rarely focused Steadicam. The post production process also looked a little too rushed, with little contrast in the inconsistent color grading.His casting decision for the lead in particular deserves some serious questioning, because frankly, Brie Larson (Trainwrecked, Room) contradicts Jeannette Walls' true hair color or skin tone. Believe me, at the end credits, you get to see real home videos of the real family, and Cretton ought to lose credibility for ignoring the detail of appearance. The reasoning behind his casting here seems more to do with Brie's rising status as an A-list celebrity with a rocking body and normal everyday face. Although, it could have been worse, Jennifer Lawrence, who looks even less like Jeannette Walls, almost took the part instead.Yet amongst the beautified celebrity sickness, it still communicates the hard truth about honoring our own family members, even the dysfunctional ones. The whole cast works to their greatest effort to prove love's complex nature, in a trial of finding the beauty in the struggle. Some research proves that ""The Glass Castle movie is actually more accurate than the book,"" (Bustle) and in film, the extra explored possibilities unravel one alcoholic father's dangerous self-fear.Consistently in Jeannette's point of view, we watch her lifelong hunt after the demons in her life as she basically had to raise herself and her three siblings as they live from their suitcases. At a young age, she burned herself while cooking lunch because her mother cared more about her oil painting. Her father lead her in forced swimming lessons by throwing her into the water, literally drowning her. Then he attacked the swimming pool manager after the lesson nearly killed her, leading to the family running off into the wilderness to live.She wanted nothing more than her abusive father to stop drinking, but she still loyally stitched his wounds and stargazed with him until she became old enough to question why. Yes, the ups and downs she shared with her father come off strong, and his intentions, even if dangerous, always seemed good in his perspective for his little ""mountain goat"" (the nickname he gave her). He taught her an important philosophy she unconsciously kept throughout her life: ""you learn from living, all else is a damn lie.""So with each dusty landscape, with each blanketing snowfall, with each new painting covering up the family's trash heap of a home, with each stick of butter mixed with sugar, with each traumatizing episode with the father's mother, you sweat in dizzying fury as you watch the difficulties the father put his family through, until the outcome at last gives you some hope. The feminism here also meets common ground— while the women here need no man to obtain completeness, one can still make her a more well-rounded individual, just like in real life.Once the credits roll after the turmoil, the proper morals spark your lightbulb: whether run by drunks or supported by loving saints, your family stays your family, no matter what happens. We each need one another, because we can never achieve perfection on our own. Whoever read the book should be satisfied with the recreated feel of the reading experience. I don't think I can recommend it to anyone else unfamiliar with the book, better cinematic family dramas deserve your time, such as the recent Captain Fantastic, which communicate the hard truth in a more impactful way. So long story short, Walls' intent of The Glass Castle remains unscathed: forgiveness helps you just as much as it helps your debtor.",The Glass Castle

67,jmc4769,Fails to capture much of what was good about the book,5,20 August 2017,"The Glass Castle was one of my favorite books that I've read recently. But unfortunately, the movie fails to capture much of what was good about the book: 1. In the book the story is told from Jeanette's perspective. She is the narrator and the main character. In the movie there is no narrator and you could make the case that the main character is not Jeanette, but her father, Rex. 2. In the book the main focus is on how the children, through their resourcefulness, are able to overcome horrible parenting. The movie devotes some attention to the children's resourcefulness. But the main focus is on the father's child abuse and neglect, which makes the movie much darker than the book. 3. Except in one dramatic scene that occurs near the beginning, the movie places the blame for most of the bad things that happen to the family squarely on the shoulders of Jeanette's father. But in the book Jeanette's mother is almost as responsible for the family's down and out situation. In one memorable scene in the book (missing from the movie), the children, after going hungry for days, find their mother hiding under a blanket eating from her hoard of chocolate bars. 4. Most of the movie takes place after the family moves to West Virginia, which is the most difficult and depressing time period for the family. Almost all of the lighthearted, funny, and enjoyable parts of the book happen when the family is living out west, before they move to West Virginia. But the movie just skims over that part of the story. 5. The movie has a sentimental, ""Hollywood"" ending which is not true to the more realistic ending in the book.",The Glass Castle

Make no mistake, this is an unpleasant movie featuring first rate actors trying to make a flawed screen adaptation work.

Themes explored? Self-hatred, male emasculation, alcoholism, extreme poverty (the family sometimes goes a half week without any food), backwater depression and hopelessness, and wonderful and expansive dreams with no substance.

This review is solely based on the movie since i never read the book.
It was very emotional and kept me interested in the story the whole time, but the ending left me feeling a little ripped off with confusion and unanswered questions.
We are told why the father is the way he is, but we never find out what's up with the mother. The whole time you don't know if she's mentally ill, delusional, sociopathic, an abuse victim, or what. I mean no normal mother allows their children to grow up like that and her motives are never explained to us.
The ending turned out to be very silly. She decides to divorce her husband and quit her job and accept where she comes from, then they all sit around the dinner table talking about how great the father was. I'm sorry but that doesn't count as closure to me. It felt so foolish after such a serious movie.

He alienates his family. His wife enables his abusive behavior. Will he nevertheless, over the long run earn the respect of his daughters? Will they come to realize his ""brilliance?""

Pedestrian direction; highly artificial sets, costumes, and make-up; and three miscast leads who never jell together and exhibit absolutely no chemistry. What a missed opportunity. Imagine what someone like Mike Nichols could have done with this material?",The Glass Castle
81,SomeGuyName,Strains believability,6,16 November 2017,"People have called this movie cheesy because of Harrelson's ""overacting"" performance, and his character's ""unbelievable"" shifting between cruelty and genuine love - while others will recognise the twisted logic and menacing stares. You can't even call him ""a broken person"", ""an emotional cripple"" or ""a childhood PTSD victim"" anymore, because those terms have been used too frequently to keep their true meaning. But this is what ""messed up, not evil"" used to mean. And let me tell you with outmost certainty that men like him exist. I was left disappointed with this movie, and it was not because of the supposed shallowness of Hollywood - rather, is was because it felt like the director didn't quite ""get"" the emotional core of the story. There was clearly a lot of heart and earnest passion behind this movie, but it struggled with tone and editing - so much that you are never left with a clear feeling of what growing up in a family like this is really like.It not only sugarcoated the ugliness that spurs inside of everyone,(yes, even the children) who are exposed to an environment like this for too long - it also ignored arguably the most inspirational part of the movie. What extreme struggle it must have been to rise above poverty like our main character did! Yet almost her entire education and ""from rags to riches"" career as a journalist was left to be explained through a short montage. Performances are great, but the scenes are drawn out too long, and thus kept losing some of their spark. The jump between time is hard to bear at times, because it spends too little time at crucial moments in the main character's life, and too much at others. And despite the great acting, a lot of the emotional scenes did not move me like they should - I think, in part, because the tone was too light as compared to what was portrayed. You do not see the mother shaking in fear near her violent husband when he's in a bad mood - you see her paint and act feeble-minded. You do not see any evidence of the children growing feral amongst each other, raised on starvation, violence and homelessness - you watch them cry, then grow up like normal kids do. And according to this movie, what are the consequences of huge open sores + alcoholism + poverty? Scars! That's it.What happened here is that the director rightly so realised that the story was too dark for a big audience; so he tried to water it down. But the story was so black in the first place, that removing too many of it's truths left us with something that covers a heavy subject, yet feels too artificial, and too palpable. Yet so wrong, because the funny parts are still too dark to laugh at - and it's still too heavy a subject to give it a ""quirky family"" twist. I was also lightly disturbed by the movie's message and how the climax was where she realises that daddy was right all along. If it was up to me, the movie should've focused on how she broke free of the abuse and became a normal person - to revel in her independence and anger, leaving us with a sense of clarity and relief when she finally chooses to forgive her family. Instead, it focuses on the ""family union above all!""-message, making the conclusion feel more disturbing than happy.",The Glass Castle

83,dermobreen,"Simple, effective story-telling",7,24 August 2017,"I watched my wife, Ciara, cry her way through Jeanette Walls' New York Times best- selling biography, The Glass Castle. I initially dismissed the book as chick-lit but was sufficiently intrigued by the trailer to want to see this movie. To be honest it was less the trailer and more the realisation that Brie Larson and Woody Harrelson were the stars. I'm fans of both actors and was curious. I'm glad I was.The story is that of a young girl who comes of age in a dysfunctional family of nonconformist nomads with a mother (Naomi Watts) who's an eccentric artist and an alcoholic father (Harrelson) who stirs their children's imagination with hope as a distraction to their poverty. The focus of this hope is the titular glass castle, which is a folly.I came to this film not knowing it was a biography and it was only during the end credits, where the real-life characters are shown, that I realised the events I had been watching was true. In a cinema schedule of comic book adaptations, re-telling of old tales, sequels and prequels, The Glass Castle is a refreshing piece of work. It joins this summer's stand-out mainstream films: Dunkirk, Baby Driver and Detroit as unique creations.At times painful and uplifting, the film is replete with well-developed characters and a story that draws one in. We feel the pain, the anguish, the hope, the heart-break, the cruelty, the despair and the love present in this family. The story is told from the perspective of the author, Jeanette (Brie Larson) in flashbacks to her childhood from where she is today, engaged to a successful New York financier. Larson is spot on. Her portrayal captures the conflict she experiences and the dyadic love/hate relationship she has with her father. Harrelson will surely get an Oscar nomination for the life he breathes into the father. He is both villain and hero in his children's eyes.This is family life, a slice of a particular family's life. The story-telling, the acting are all top-notch. I have read some indifferent reviews. For me the film is worth a second viewing, if only to dig deeper into the layers of the characters and their shared story.Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton who also directed the critically acclaimed Short Term 12, this is a fine addition to his resumé and marks him out as a director to keep an eye on.Definitely worth a look.

Unfortunately, the movie is a classic Hollywood portrayal of such a subject. We go through a few key points that occurred in the book, only to have that counterpointed with points in the screenplay as to why the parents are actually sympathetic people, and why (at the end of the day) they truly cared about the children deep down. The movie actually leaves audiences with the feeling and idea that the main character feels ""lucky"" to have the *terrible and abusive experience* she did in childhood.Absolutely no *true* responsibility is assigned to the parents that abused their children in this movie-just the idea that they are sympathetic screw ups that tried their best.Child abuse is a serious subject, and of course, we can leave it to Hollywood to take a memoir about that dark subject and turn it into a classic bitter-sweet tale of a dysfunctional (but of course all-American!) family simply getting through their lives as best as they can while deep down caring about their children.",The Glass Castle
87,Melvin_Tigerfists,"Grotesque Story of Broken, Co-Dependent Adults with No Boundaries",8,22 September 2017,"First, this film is apparently based on a true story, so it makes no sense to criticize the message. Life is messy. Please do not take my review as an appeal to make all films tidy and redemptive.That said, not all true stories are worth committing to film and being held up as examples of family commitment and unconditional love. I found the ""heart"" of this film to be twisted and dark, and the message to be potentially harmful to people with truly abusive and heartbreaking family circumstances.Woody Harrelson plays an abusive drunk who terrorizes and mercilessly deprives his own children. He also meticulously manipulates his co-dependent wife to enable his dysfunctions and remain cooperative with every sick development, including the sexual molestation of their son by his own grandmother. This is supposed to be ""balanced"" by the fact that he is a dreamer who is occasionally nice. Heck, he even coughed up some tuition money. Once. After stealing money from the same kid earlier. What a great dad. As the kids mature and literally escape into independence as adults, the mentally deranged parents follow them all the way to New York City and continue to sabotage their happiness. When a family member attempts to draw boundaries in order to establish some sanity and peace, they all conspire to leverage one another back into the nightmare with guilt trips.The central character, one of the daughters, actually manages to put together a relatively sane life (one in which she copes with her background by lying to others about it), but is repeatedly told by the father that she is not really happy and craves his brand of freedom and ""adventure"". ""Down is up, left is right,"" says the sociopath.The nice, happy part of the movie is when the dad finally dies, making it easier for the remaining family to gloss over and romanticize the brutal treatment they received as the children and wife of a lazy, booze-addled abuser.I gave it an 8 out of 10 because it is well acted, convincing, and impeccably made.

There was no depth to the movie at all and at times it felt ridiculous and insulting to watch the Hollywood portrayal of these characters, particularly with Naomi Watts. Naomi's make-up and wardrobe were horribly contrived and her acting wasn't much better. She was a bad choice for Rose Mary. The movie changed the order and places of events, skipped about half the book, and threw some important parts in at awkward times just to get them in the movie. They also just plain made stuff up, particularly with the ending.The movie lost the emotional punch of the book because they omitted everything that was difficult and meaningful. I didn't care about any of the characters and I was so frustrated and bored that I actually got up and left the theater for a few minutes. It was a sugar-coated, feel good mess.

Told from the adult Jeanette's perspective looking back, the movie version took on a serious tone right away and lost some of what made the book such an addictive (no pun intended) read. When told from a child's perspective, some of the family's experiences seemed truly magical, like spending the night in the desert or dancing in rain puddles during a storm. I also felt a stronger emotional connection to the dad through young Jeanette's idealized view of him and was less able to hate him later when his alcoholism totally spiraled out of control. From the child's perspective, Jeanette's growing realization that her larger than life dad was not so heroic was very potent. The story told by the adult Jeanette was still emotionally powerful, but the present dysfunction gave away the secret of why her parents were so odd and why they kept moving. The fiancé was barely mentioned in the book, but I loved the dynamics between him and the dad in the film. That add-in was very helpful in understanding how Walls came to terms with who she is and where she came from. I wish the other siblings had been more developed.

Particularly in the scene (childhood flashback) where the parents were fighting to the point of dad (Rex) holding mom (Rose Mary) out of the second-story window of their home. The kids (below in the yard) are innocently jump-roping when this event unfolds. They run up in pure terror to save their mother, dangling out the window. Only for her to finally be pulled back in by Rex, and the two parents burst out in a fit of chaotic laughter.If THAT doesn't scream ""crazy,"" I don't know what does! Anywho, the feelings evoked in me during these moments is what truly made me love this film. It was VERY real.I'm only giving it an 8/10 though because I've been told by someone close to me just how far off this portrayal is from the actual book. I personally haven't read the book, but I have to give that some kind of credit.It seems that the film has possibly made Rex (the father) some type of ""anti-hero"" when in reality, (or according to the book) he didn't deserve all the praise. I'll just have to read the book myself to make that decision, but as far as the movie alone is concerned, I really enjoyed it, and yeah, in the end, I did feel sorry for Rex.(Also, Woody Harrelson KILLED this role.)",The Glass Castle
99,MHeying777-1,Made Especially for the Wounded Warrior.,8,14 August 2017,"This is the film of the century for wounded warriors like myself who survived severe childhood trauma and chaos. I sat down in the theater and it was over in a blink. I sobbed in more than a couple of places and left in a state of shock that lasted for hours. For ""civilians,"" this masterful bio- flick will not be such a monumental achievement, for they lack a frame of reference. The sting of a hornet is an abstract notion for those who've never been stung. But for the rest of us..., wham!Casting: Excellent, especially the roles of Jeannette and her father, Rex. The child roles were very effective, especially those of Jeannette.Acting: Brilliant by Brie and Woody, who channeled Jeannette and Rex The Rosemary (mother of Jeannette) role was believable but didn't convey the degree of maternal indifference in the book. Woody seemed overweight for the role, but his mannerisms and speech delivery made up for it. He had several strong moments, but I expect his rendition of Rex's delirium in his Herculean struggle to quit drinking will be shown on Oscar night. Script: Well done. Jeannette's story unfolds in overlapping flashbacks, starting when Jeannette as an accomplished adult writer in New York. Very effective for the way it emulates the consciousness of someone wrestling with their traumatic history but challenging for those who crave a simplistic plot line.Setting: There are three main settings--New York City, Arizona and Virginia mountains (or similar ""hillbilly"" country). The Arizona desert scenes lacked the full brilliance of the sweeping sunsets and nighttime Milky Way galaxy that I recall. The scenes in New York and Virginia were confined as well, but effective.Themes: Triumph over the effects of alcoholism, parental neglect, pedophilia and the resiliency of children in the face of parental dysfunction.Key Dialog: ""We have to stick together,"" teenage Jeannette to her siblings.Suggestion: Read the book first. Jeannette's an excellent writer.This complicated, emotionally draining film owes much of its high effectiveness to the fact that it is a true story, proving that fiction cannot compete with the harrowing reality of well rendered truth.",The Glass Castle
100,sbloram,idealizing parental abuse,6,10 November 2020,"This really had potential... amazing cast, well acted, beautiful cinematography. however, the significance of parental abuse seemed extremely diluted. the father was essentially made out to be a hero by the end of the film, skating passed all the horrific situations he had put his children in throughout.
everyone has their flaws, no family is perfect, no parents are perfect. i understand the message of loving someone despite their worst attributes (and woody harrelson and naomi watts gave outstanding performances in their roles) but i was really hoping for more of a moment of redemption for the parents. the final father/daughter moments were well done and emotional, but too little, too late, in my opinion! and the real footage at the end further added to the irritation as the father was idolized; painted to have been a great father who just had some quirks, rather than an abusive sociopath. and the mother bore none of the weight or responsibility for allowing those situations to happen to her children. don't make these people out to be extraordinary... those children should've been taken away from them a dozen times over.",The Glass Castle
101,jonathanbrown12,Well worth the time.,9,7 October 2018,"Being a fan of Janette Walls' work, I was excited to see this movie, and was not disappointed. The writing was fascinating, the acting was terrific, and the cinematography was incredible. I love the acting choice for this film: Woody Harrelson was the perfect fit for the father, Brie Larson was beautiful as Janette. There was not a single acting choice that I could not think of replacing (except maybe the brother's mustache). Each character seemed to bring their all for this film.This is a movie that is highly recommended in my book. You learn to have a love/hate feel for many of the characters. The parents continued struggle to balance their own struggles with raising a big family is hard to accept (the father's constant drinking, and the mother neglect of her children for her art); yet there are times when the family comes together and it seems like there may be hope yet.There is real heartbreak seeing the kids saving up money and running away so they could have a chance at life. But then, to see it all work out for them, shows hope that no one HAS to play the cards they are dealt. Sometime you can change your hand, as long as you believe in yourself. I think this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I would recommend anyone and everyone to rent, buy, download, whatever you need to do to see this movie.",The Glass Castle
102,kevinlemenager,Life in Welch,5,20 October 2017,"The Glass Castle is probably my favorite book that I've read, but not the best movie that I've seen. As I child, I was never really much of a reader. I always dreaded reading in front of my fellow classmates and I had a short attention span. So reading an entire novel felt almost impossible to me (I would read a few chapters then never finish). I would always rely on others to read the books that were mandatory for class. It wasn't until my Senior year that I finally read a book that kept me invested until the end of the book. The Glass Castle is the true story of a woman who grew up in a less than ideal home life. Her family was always moving from place to place, having almost nothing to eat, and living with an alcoholic father and hippie mother. So when I found out that they were going to make a movie, I was thrilled. Everything about it seemed like a success. From the casting to the author's involvement. So what went wrong? I actually did like the movie. The performances are terrific and it does feel like they didn't ignore the message of the book. The main problem is the fact that they made it a little to ""Hollywood."" The book is very ""R,"" with a lot of stuff that they cut in order to keep it ""PG-13."" They don't gloss over anything important, but they don't push the boundaries enough either. So for the most part, The Glass Castle was satisfying enough. I'm just glad it got adapted.",The Glass Castle

Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts, and Ella Anderson (who plays a young Jeannette) were brilliant. The pace of the movie is relatively even toned. I think the frustration that viewers may encounter has more to do with the context and material of the movie vs. the pace.

110,martha-adam1,Irritatingly 'Hollywood' adaptation of an incredible book,5,17 October 2017,"I read the book last week so it was fresh in my mind when I went to see the film, and I know this will sound like another book lover whining ""the book was better"" but this is absolutely the case. If you haven't read Walls' memoir, it is a beautifully written, honest account of a childhood with parents who were selfish and neglectful to an absurd degree. One of the best things about it is that Walls writes without any self pity and focuses the story on how she and her siblings survived thanks to their resourcefulness despite the ridiculous things her parents did. It is emotional because the reader is left to make their own judgement rather than the author telling us to pity her for how awful it was. What blows my mind is how the Hollywood misogyny machine managed to make the entire film about the father. Yes the father is a huge part of the story, and the author had a closer relationship with him than some of her siblings, but the film made him out to be some kind of anti-hero. We are directed to see how flawed and imperfect he is in a ""yeah he did some bad things but really he was great"" kind of way with the result that you come away feeling like he really tried his best and nothing was really his fault. All of this is at the expense of the mother being a developed character - in the film she is a 'battered wife' stereotype, whereas in real life she was just as selfish and neglectful, and as accountable as the father. The memoir gives a variety of instances such as when the children had not eaten for days and found the mother eating from her hoard of chocolate bars; or when the kids found a diamond ring and the mother refused to sell it to pay for food because it could replace the engagement ring the father never got her and her self-esteem was more important!The resolution of the film was the part that made me the most angry. Brie Larson tearfully tells her husband she's leaving the restaurant (of course she really means leave the marriage), removes her heels and starts running down the road to get to her dying father - what the hell?! Followed by an emotional deathbed reconciliation with the father and the final Thanksgiving scene where Larson sobs ""I feel so lucky"" before the family toast to the father as if all is forgiven - it was so saccharine it made me want to vomit.Ultimately the whole film relied on stereotypes - the tortured alcoholic father, the weak mother, Larson as a cold career woman who ultimately decides her dysfunctional-yet-lovable family are more important than money and success. All of this dumbed it down just enough to be just another story of a man doing whatever the hell he wants and ultimately being forgiven in the end because deep down he had a good heart and wiped out all of the parts of the original memoir that made it such a riveting, unforgettable read.My final gripe is the choice to switch from the child to adult actors during some of the later childhood scenes. Of course this is common and does involve some suspension of disbelief, however it was particularly uncomfortable during the scene in the bar with Robbie. Now then, it's pretty bad that Rex pretty much gives Robbie permission to take his daughter upstairs and do whatever he wants because she can take care of herself. In the film, we're invited to feel sympathetic towards Rex (again) because he's just found out his beloved Mountain Goat is planning to leave him. He's hurt, he's betrayed, so why should he come to her defence right? So she goes upstairs with Robbie, he tries to rape her but she gets away by showing him her ""ugly scars"". She's played by Larson at this point and she's about to move to NYC, so how old would we imagine she is, late teens? Well folks, here's a revelation for you - SHE WAS THIRTEEN. In real life that wasn't an ill-judged incident brought on by Rex's grief for his abusive mother, no, he deliberately took his 13-year-old daughter to the bar with the express purpose of using her to charm older men so that he win their money. He then does nothing to stop said older men taking his 13-year-old daughter upstairs and it's only at that point that the film and the book line up. But let's remember she was THIRTEEN. What angers me is the fact that the filmmakers decided they wanted to put that scene in (presumably for some kind of shock value) but decided that it was a little too shocking, so we'll water it down by having an adult actor and throwing in more emotional context that makes the father slightly less of an asshole and puts more responsibility on his adult daughter to look after herself. Because if the real story had been shown, we might be a bit too angry with the father to be OK with the nice little deathbed reconciliation. See my problem? What I will say, is that this film was very well acted, particularly by Larson and Harrelson. I still found myself drawn in and welling up in some of the more emotional scenes, so perhaps if you haven't got the book to compare it to, you may like it. It's only that that makes it a 5 rather than a 2 for me; though I'm still irritated that most of the elements that made the book so good have been cut to satisfy Hollywood's apparently insatiable appetite for stories about middle-aged white men.",The Glass Castle
111,markandtsimpson,Not true to the book,6,6 August 2018,"This movie really bothered me. Rex Walls was not a misunderstood man whose demons excused the neglect and abuse he made his family suffer. He was a drunk con-artist who made his family suffer by not providing them with food or shelter. He was also an expert in conning his children into believing that he actually loved and cared about them. The Mom was not portrayed properly, she was equally complicit with the neglect and horrible childhood those children endured. The movie should have been about the children and how they somehow managed to thrive, not their horrible alcoholic father and lazy mother.",The Glass Castle
112,reverendlinneken,"Good acting, lacking focus",7,11 August 2017,"The acting and writing for this movie are great, however, I think it missed the mark in terms of what of this incredible story the screen writers chose to focus on. I read the book as an amazing story of resilience, and while the film certainly didn't shy from the fact that Walls thrived despite the neglect and emotional abuse she endured as a child, it played more like a story about her relationship with her father than as a personal story about her tenacity to survive despite it all. I found the book inspiring. The movie didn't inspire as much as it pulled the heart strings. In the end her parents looked a bit too sympathetic, and I left the theater feeling that us viewers were robbed of some of the most raw and telling details her of her childhood, the details that best illustrated just how trying and unique her life was growing up. In all, though I thought the acting was great, I think the meat of Jeanette's personal story of transformation was sacrificed to make space for telling the specific story of her relationship with her father.",The Glass Castle

What it can do is make Brie Larson look like maybe the best actress of her generation. (Sue me!) What it can do is pair her with Woody Harrelson, who may very well have delivered the best performance of the entire year. (That's saying something: Harrelson got an Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in a separate film.)Harrelson and Larson work wonders as a duo, forcing us to find strength and empathy in the strangest places imaginable while shedding light on an extraordinary truth: We are all a little bit broken, but the brokenness we'd never ask for comes with a beauty we'd never trade away.There are films you expect to shoot an arrow into your soul, and instead they send knife after knife, hook after hook, until they've ripped you apart and put you back together.

119,allaman-george,Direct Hit,10,5 March 2019,"I've never given a movie a rating of 10 before. This movie hit me on every emotional level I can be hit. It felt like it was made for me, and, judging from most of the people who were moved enough to write reviews, it hit them similarly.I was surprised and disappointed that the Ebert review, with which I usually agree, was so low at 2 stars. I think you have to have had a certain set of experiences to truly ""get"" this movie, and if you do, every scene, every line, every nuance hits you right between the eyes. If you don't perhaps it's just another formulaic story about the value of family.The story's essence is the emotional conflict we all have with our families - inextricably attached and yet simultaneously repulsed. As the father of an adult daughter whom I love desperately and who is completely estranged from me by her mother, to my dismay and shame I saw a lot of myself in Rex, and that was gut-wrenching. I am not an alcoholic and I have an upper middle class income from a rewarding profession, but in her absence I am left with the ugly awareness of having failed my daughter in so many ways. Every missed opportunity to connect, every misunderstood plea for emotional closeness, every selfish parental moment haunts and shames me. This movie, and this story, captured every aspect of that perfectly. The acting, casting, production, timing, flow, score, all were right on target. I can't think of a single thing I would change.Woody Harrelson was perfectly cast for Rex and he did not disappoint. But for me the prize goes to Brie Larson. Her stoic depiction of adult Jeanette captures perfectly the curse of one who carries a heavy conflict around that nobody else but their family can understand. Every blink, every pause, every sideward glance silently conveys the inner pain of that conflict in a way that leads the viewer to believe that only they understand it. For me this is movie acting at its subtle best.If you have a perfect family and are a perfect person, this movie will bore you senseless. If you disowned your family decades ago it will seem stupid. But for the rest of us this movie is a shot straight to the heart and will reveal to you a lot of the meaning behind your family conflicts.",The Glass Castle

The timeline of that experience is not clear in the movie, how she gets from being ""home-schooled"" as in given books to read without direction, to being a scholarship student at Barnard is vague. Obviously, it happened. While telling the story of that abusive childhood is a major part of the movie, the really unsettling part is the de rigeur forgiveness and redemption of the parents.
By the end of the movie, there's nothing left but happy memories because when their smart, self-educated father wasn't extremely drunk, he could be very creative and engaging. Forgiving is wonderful and necessary. Forgetting leaves mistakes to be repeated. It's well acted by Harrellson - it's a rich part, tailor- made for him - not ot so much by Watts who simply seems to be miscast. Performances by the various Jeannettes as they are growing up are compelling. But I couldn't possibly recommend this movie to anyone.

129,tedogmo,The Mesmerizing Journey Of A Partly Broken Family,10,12 May 2019,"Rex : ""I never did build that Glass Castle, huh.""
Jeanette : ""Yeah, but we had a lot of fun playing in it.""The Glass Castle is a film that captures the audience like no other. It is a tale of survival, willingness and a semi-broken love. The film revolves around the Walls Family. Heading them are Rex (Woody Harrelson), an alcoholic who is constantly drunk and jobless, and Rosemarie (Naomi Watts), a delusional artist who believes that she will make it big with her paintings, even though she knows clearly she won't. The children: Jeanette, Lori, Brian and Maureen are raised with the belief that learning takes place outside and are deprived of an opportunity to attend school.The family, constantly on the run from debt collectors and authorities, find it difficult to secure a place to live. This helps the family realise that home is not a place, but home is the people around you. The film particularly highlights the bond between a young Jeanette (Ella Anderson) and her father Rex. The beautiful story unfolds of how they interact with each other through arduous times. At times, they have an inseperable bond, but when life gets too tough, their relationship is tested to the limit. When they finally land a rickety place to live in, Rex promises Jeanette that he would build the Glass Castle that he had always planned, a beautiful glass structure that would serve as a new home for them. Everyday, they experience the joy of building the foundation for their new structure, while at the same time juggling problems like poverty, hunger and Rex's irresponsibility.As times changed, a now older Jeanette (Brie Larson) and her siblings realise that they cannot keep living an impoverished life anymore. Jeanette, Lori and Brian then plan to leave to New York to pursue their studies and escape their pitiful lifestyle, leaving Maureen behind. When Lori leaves, Rex is furiated and disallows anyone to leave again. However, when Jeanette is going to leave to New York too, Rex is heartbroken and finally realises the damage he has caused to the family.Jeanette is now a successful writer of a gossip column. She vows never to regard Rex anymore. However, when events unfold, she would finally realise the importance of her father and appreciate the life that he gave her.The film is a true testament to the human values in difficult times. It truly shows the story of how Rex, a naturally smart and extremely intelligent man, uses unorthodox methods to raise Jeanette and his children to make a change in society. It also reflects the roller coaster of emotions that is Jeanette's life, even when she's all grown up, and her complex and confusing journey through the most difficult adventure that is life.Viewers will be drawn in deeply to the movie. They would feel pity during all the conflicts, and feel touched at all the heartwarming and jovial moments that the Walls experience. Brie Larson does a flawless job in portraying a resilient and confused adult, who can also be fierce yet fragile.
Woody Harrelson also does a masterpiece of a job to make the viewers realise that life is a constant learning journey, and the only way to succeed is to fail a lot.I felt really empty after the movie as I self reflected on my blessed life. I constantly rewatch it as it really is a gem of a film, and each time it doesn't fail to make me cry. It really is one that shows the beautiful and ugly sides of a family, and shows us that no matter what we feel, emotions are temporary but family is for life.",The Glass Castle

In the movie this occurs in West Virginia most of the movie after about the 30-minute Mark takes place in West Virginia what in reality they don't arrive in West Virginia till about halfway through the book also there's no emphasis on the teachers once in West Virginia.Some situations are omitted altogether there's a situation in Nevada involving another kid around Jeanette's age this is completely omitted from the movie it seems like they wanted to focus on the dark part of the book when Jeanette is older,Rather than the ""happier"" part when Jeanette is younger. the only event from when Jeanette is younger is when she Burns herself with the hot dogs another one I would like to mention where they just seem to merge events is when she's at the pool she learns to swim in a hot spring out west she goes to a public pool in West Virginia these are merged into one event that takes place on the West Coast in the movie.I was hoping would have very big potential considering the writer was working with them. but unfourtenly this is not the case this is just hollywood tring to make it more family friendly",The Glass Castle

132,pransiskiko,Great movie!,10,18 August 2018,"Love every second of this film! Very heartwarming. I don't like reading books so I stick to watching films even they are based on books. No offence to some book lovers out there, I don't know why they watch a film and give a bad review as it's too different from the book. I watch movies for entertainmnet not to compare it with the book I read. Books and movies are never ever going to be the same. The Glass Castle deserves a much higher rating!",The Glass Castle
133,proniomj,Fabulous,9,12 August 2017,"As the sister of someone extremely like Rex, I was disturbed, heart- broken, and reminded of my life growing up with an unpredictable, intelligent, unstable, and sometimes very charming man. His children loved him inexplicably but they are still living with the effects of their tumultuous life. This movie, in my opinion, was fabulous. It was well paced and the dual story lines of past and current day melded beautifully. All of the acting was superb. Woody Harrelson deserves an Academy Award and all of the child actors were phenomenal. I was especially impressed by Ella Anderson who played young Jeannette. She expressed so clearly her emotions, both love, hurt, and anger at her father and with that I believe she also deserves kudos. Go see this movie if you enjoy deep, emotional, thought-provoking films.",The Glass Castle
134,vikivok,Exceptional,10,21 December 2017,"Personally I found this film amazing. I was waiting for months to see this, and when I did i wasn't disappointed. The actors, especially Woody Harrelson played his character just as I imagined he would do so. Ella Henderson who played young Jeanette was also quite exceptional, and it was fascinating to see how such a young girl can play a role as hard as young Jeanette was.
I did not understand why the critics were so negative, because if the writer Jeanette Walls was content with how the film turned out, how can they say that it did not catch the tone of the book?I would recommend this movie if you are interested in deep and non-superficial movies, and also if you like films based on real-life events.",The Glass Castle

I'm not an huge reader and I listened to this book on audible, read by the the author. I hung on to her every word, it was so gripping! I was excited to see there was a movie shortly after I finished. However the movie was horrible. It was hard to follow and did not flow like the book. They left out major defining parts of their lives. I could barely make it through til the end. The ONLY saving grace was at the end they show actual home video and photos of the family.",The Glass Castle
137,charmagnehaight,Thoughtful and beautifully acted.,7,5 February 2018,"The Glass Castle is one of those films that stirs up all the dirty messy bits from an abusive and neglectful childhood. It also reminds us that even in the middle of anger, pain and regret, that there is a form of beauty within it all. The book by Jeanette Walls on which this film is based is one of my ""Top 10"" books. I connected with this story and could not put it down. The film is based on a memoir from the author's own personal story growing up with her three siblings and neglectful dysfunctional parents. Her father was an alcoholic, brilliant and yet incapable of providing for the family. Walls mother was a talented artist who stayed with her husband despite the unstable and impoverished lifestyle her and her children endured.The dual story line throughout the movie bounces back and forth from Jeanette's childhood to the present day where she is a successful writer engaged and living in NY. Naomi Watts and Woody Harrelson were beautifully cast as Jeanette's parents. Their chemistry on screen was completely believable and realistic. Harrelson rocked his role as a complex, troubled father and husband. Ella Anderson as the young Jeanette was brilliant. It goes without saying of course, but if the viewer has experienced neglect or abuse in their own life or witnessed it in the lives of others close to you, this film may be a trigger for you.",The Glass Castle

139,amwink-17030,Read the book first,6,16 June 2018,"There is no nice way to put it. The film doesn't do the book justice.The book manages to convince us that Jeanette can understand how badly her parents looked after their children and still love them. The film fails to do that, which results in a review of traumatic childhood experiences.Other reviews suggest that this is because there is too much to fit in the 2 hours of film. The problem of the film is that too much has been put in, and all the childhood stories are shown as short flashbacks. But the lack of time, and the loss of chronological ordering, make it impossible to see the strong theme in the book: that somehow the children manage to deal with their hardships and turn them into something positive. The power in the childhood stories for me was that Jeanette managed to be in control in the end, and that effect was missing in the film flashbacks for lack of time. It would have been better to select fewer stories and then fully develop them. Read the book first, without it the film does not make sense.",The Glass Castle

143,kyle-roberts-00085,"A movie driven by the script, not the plot",8,13 August 2017,"This is a movie based on a woman's memoir and flashes back between the main character's childhood and adult life. There is no bomb that needs to be defused or deranged madman that needs to be stopped. The scary monsters exist within the minds of the complex characters that are built up over the course of the movie. In the end I had a real sense that I understood the characters and what made them flawed and damaged. The film had great character development, great writing, great acting, not corny or cheesy and no sunshine blown up my ass at the end. This is a good, well crafted movie. You just have to understand, this wasn't made by Ridley Scott, there is no super-genetic alien fight scene at the end, the movie has no epic quest to save the universe. It's just the story of a girl's life and her complex relationship with her highly eccentric and ideological father.",The Glass Castle
144,jogforjoy,Woody Harrelson Was Amazing,10,15 August 2017,"If you are the adult child of an alcoholic or if you were ever told by your parents that ""what happens in this house stays in this house"" then you will love Woody Harrelson's portrayal of the dad. Naomi Watts portrayal of the mom was stunning, as well. I was uncomfortable seeing what amounts to the reality of life in so many American homes, and, I was relieved to see the reality of life in so many American homes because it resonated with me.I loved the book but I loved the movie adaptation of the book even more because my imagination could not fathom some of what I read. I grew up with a ""Glass Castle"" kind of dad in whom the whole family trusted. This movie portrays how that dynamic happens and it is riveting.",The Glass Castle

As a person who went to very similar events in her life, I loved this movie and cried with it. Even my boyfriend told me that i was just like Jeanette... maybe you need to have a personal connection to these type of people in order to care for them and feel every emotion that they go through.

147,solrock-32525,It's garbage,1,2 December 2017,"This movie is just a disgusting glorification of rape culture, severe child abuse and neglect, alcoholism, and childhood. Nothing in it's even remotely realistic (it's a move I get it but still) and it's just painful to watch. Not painful as in emotionally gripping but utterly pathetic and ridiculous. I couldn't even make it through to the end, it was that bad. Don't waste your time with this move it's not emotional. It attempts to be ""deep"" and I bet the smug director thinks he's shedding light on an unseen issue in America, but it's so obscure and has no relevant information whatsoever. If you want to educate yourself, look elsewhere. If you want to be moved, look elsewhere. If your time is valuable, look elsewhere!",The Glass Castle

150,eschini,The Extraordinary Film The Glass Castle Shatters All Others in Recent Years,9,18 January 2019,"The Glass Castle is one of the most exceptional films in the recent years. Throughout The Glass Castle there was never a moment where I was not on the edge of my seat. This outstanding film was packed full of an intense and suspenseful storyline that was over before I knew it. This emotional film is directed by talented Destin Daniel Cretton.
While The Glass Castle has a very powerful message about overcoming the dysfunctional family relationships during Jeannette Walls's childhood, the Short Term 12, also directed by Cretton, portrays the idea of helping troubled teenagers in a long term foster care. However, I prefer to watch The Glass Castle any day. The captivating movie of The Glass Castle can largely be attributed to Brie Larson's amazing character portrayal. Brie and many other actors contribute to this beautifully crafted film that is based on a personal memoir written by Jeannette Walls. Although Brie Larson is excellent in other roles including Short Term 12, 21 Jump Street and 13 Going on 30, nothing compares to the outstanding lead role that she plays in the The Glass Castle. If it wasn't for her overpowering performance, the film would not be where it is today. Overall, there are many factors that contributed to the outstanding and remarkable message portrayed in the film based on the disturbing family events experienced throughout Walls's childhood.
The film begins in 1989 when Jeanette (Brie Larson) a successful and wealthy columnist for New York magazine, engaged to David (Max Greenfield), are out to dinner when Jeannette later that night notices her parents on the streets searching through garbage cans. This is only the beginning of seeing how embarrassed and ashamed she is of her parents. As the movie progresses, Cretton uses many flashbacks to allow the audience to see the dysfunctional abusive family relationships from Jeanette's childhood contrasting it to her new improved life. We begin to learn more about her father, Rex Walls (Woody Harrelson), through these flashbacks that illustrate the abusive family relationships. Her father who is an alcoholic, and rarely holds a job, repeatedly tells the kids a fairytale that one day he will build their ""glass castle"". His wife, Rose Mary (Naomi Watts) is a ""talented"" artist, gives little care for the children and only concentrates on her painting. Because the parents do not have a stable income, the family is homeless and forced to move frequently. Meanwhile Rex explains to the children that one day they will overcome these hardships and live in a glass castle. Over time we see how Jeanette and her siblings develop distrust in their father and realize he never follows through with his promises. The children soon understand that they need to change their situation and collectively decide to save up their money to move out of this unhealthy environment. Despite Jeannette's desire to leave her parents, in the end she realizes how empowering her father influences have been.
The success of the flashbacks used throughout the movie relied on the director, Cretton to use outstanding makeup skills especially to age the parents, Rex and Rose. Not only is the effect of makeup in the story dominant, but the lighting in the film creates a tone that strongly demonstrates the harsh reality of poverty living conditions. When the story recalls Jeanette's childhood, the lighting instantly is darker in order to show the dingy house. The gloomy lighting contributes to the somber impact of the dilapidated house while illustrating the poor living conditions including not having indoor plumbing and sparse food supplies. The director dresses the characters in ragged clothes and their general appearance is disheveled to further illustrate their poverty. These flashbacks shape the theme and allow the audience to understand the challenges and dysfunctionality that Jeanette's family faced. The author uses these flashbacks to show the family's transformation over time and tell a very powerful story, however, it lacks balance and smooth transitions between time periods. Consequently at some points during the film it can be confusing. The director also uses music throughout the film to emphasize the mood and tone of that specific time. For example, one very memorable scene early in the film is when Jeannette accidentally sets herself on fire in the kitchen while making hot dogs. As she is making the hot dogs the music is quieter leading up to her dress catching the flame. Immediately as her clothing catches on fire the music becomes very loud leading to an emotion evoking scene. This scene in particular is very powerful because it sets the tone for the majority of the movie and showing how negligent and dysfunctional her parents are during her childhood. Despite the effective music, lighting and descriptions setting the tone of the accidental fire scene, the marginal acting and unrealistic special effects leave something to be desired by the audience.
By the end of this remarkable film, it is difficult to forget the powerful theme that is created from the rollercoaster of events portraying Jeannette's life. This meaningful theme is also portrayed in other movies such as Rudy where a football player has dreams of playing college football, but must overcome academic and financial hurdles to attend college while persevering to achieve his athletic dream. Both movies send the viewer home with a life lesson realizing that one can face an obstacle and persevere to overcome it to achieve personal success. Ultimately, The Glass Castle has a very memorable theme for any viewer showing that stones or hardships can be thrown at someone's fairytale of a glass castle, but it will never shatter.",The Glass Castle
