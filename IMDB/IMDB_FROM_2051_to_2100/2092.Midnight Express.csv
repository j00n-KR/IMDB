0,TheLittleSongbird,"Superbly staged, with a wonderful score, powerful direction and outstanding performances",10,20 February 2011,"First off, I can understand any criticisms geared towards Midnight Express. Some might say it has a sympathetic depiction of drug traffickers. Some might say it has pitiless violence. Some might say the representation of the Turkish jailers is stereotypical. Some might say it had an over-simplistic approach to the key issues that greeted it upon release. Those who say that are in some ways right, this film does have those things.However, while they are hard to counter in a way, I actually don't consider them flaws. To me, Midnight Express was still a superbly staged film. It has atmospheric cinematography and lighting, while the direction from Alan Parker is powerful and intelligent. Giorgio Moroder's electronic score is wonderful and unforgettable, some people may think it too strident perhaps, but I loved it and thought it added a lot to the film. The film also has a very good screenplay, a very effective and iconic opening sequence and a harrowing yet gripping story.The acting is outstanding, especially Brad Davis, while Randy Quaid and the underrated John Hurt are also excellent. So all in all, Midnight Express is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Midnight Express
1,bkoganbing,Those Istanbul Blues,9,12 October 2014,"It was with some interest that I sat and watched an interview with the real Billy Hayes before writing this. Two interviews in fact where Hayes admits this film does not tell the whole story. Above all he states that this was not a first offense for him, it was only the first time he was caught smuggling hashish out of Turkey. Had to happen sooner or later and Hayes was sent to Turkish prison.That does not lessen in the slightest the impact that Midnight Express has because jail is jail no matter where you go. And jail except for a few western countries like the USA is rough. What it is is not as squalid as what you see in Turkey. And of course those rights that are in the Constitution that one takes for granted here just aren't there in most countries. It's only in countries with their legal system stemming from an Anglo-Saxon tradition that you are innocent until proved guilty. Good reason to deter people from doing what Billy Hayes did.Midnight Express is probably the best of a tradition of Americans in foreign prisons films like Breakout or Brokedown Palace as other examples. Brad Davis in a breakthrough role gives a powerful performance as our protagonist Billy Hayes. His fellow western inmates include Randy Quaid, Norbert Weisser and Academy Award nominee John Hurt. Each of them adapts to Turkish prison in their own way and they all mentor Davis.The real Billy Hayes said that the portrayal of the Turks was unjust and that we shouldn't judge Turkey by the Turks we see here. I wouldn't do that either, but who do we see but Turks involved in the criminal justice system so different that our's and Turk prisoners in the same jail that Davis and the rest are in.Jail is jail and no jail is complete without it's officials finks. Paolo Bonacelli is the stool pigeon planted in the same cell with the foreigners and he gets a rather just comeuppance for his activities. Most powerful of all is the head guard Paul Smith who has made Davis a particular target for torture. Inadvertently also he's means for Davis's deliverance.Midnight Express got two Oscars for Best Music score and best adapted screenplay and other nominations including the one John Hurt got for Best Supporting Actor. Prison films never date and Midnight Express is as powerful as when it was released in 1978.",Midnight Express
2,Leofwine_draca,Probably the most gruelling prison film in existence,8,28 August 2016,"As bleak as most prison dramas usually are, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is probably one of the most harrowing of all time. The reasons for this are that a) we watch some totally appalling things go on, b) the acting is exceptional and makes us care for the characters, and c) the realism of the film means that it's easy for the viewer to think ""this could happen to me..."", as it wouldn't be the first time drugs have been planted on an unsuspecting holidaymaker. The prison in this film is definitely the dirtiest I've ever seen, miles away from the hi-tech surveillance compounds of Britain and America.Brad Davis has the central performance, as the film follows his teenager right from his arrest to his eventual escape (seven years later!). He's excellent, creating a believable character who goes through a realistic change as the years progress. In one scene, Davis memorably snaps and goes insane, a haunting and extremely powerful moment. Supporting him are John Hurt, who gives a memorably twitchy performance, and poor young Randy Quaid. The things that happen to Quaid will make you cringe.This is definitely an adult film in nature, containing as it does some very explicit and horrible violence. The prison guards in Turkey have a thing about whacking their batons against the soles of the feet of offenders, scenes which are nearly as difficult to watch as those in MISERY. In other graphic moments, a man has his tongue bitten and ripped out of his mouth, and a prison guard gets his just desserts when he falls against a coat hook with fatal results. For a film so depressing and harsh, it's a must to have an uplifting ending, which this thankfully has, but not before Davis has undergone all manner of ordeals. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a film that every potential holidaymaker should be made to watch as a warning, and will remain in your memory long after viewing.",Midnight Express
3,SnoopyStyle,Good Prison Movie,7,4 December 2013,"Based on his book, Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) tries to smuggle hashish out of Turkey and is caught. He is eventually sentenced to 4 years and 2 months. The conditions are impossible and he faces physical and emotional trials. He makes a few friends with the foreigners in prison which includes John Hurt and Randy Quaid.While the ordeal is harrowing, I don't see how anybody could root for the guy. He's a drug smuggling idiot. That is not in dispute. He is by no means innocent. And 4 years seems like a light sentence. He didn't get caught with a joint. He was packing a lot of drugs. The fact that they're trying to play him as a sweet kid only made him look stupid.It is one of Oliver Stone's early screenplays. There is some arguments over its accuracy. I will go back to my usual expectation that this is not a documentary. I'm sure much of it is fictionalized.The ending seems a little bit unrealistic. But it's a good prison movie overall. There are some surprisingly original scenes in this. Oliver Stone probably had something to do with that.",Midnight Express
4,Hitchcoc,It Is Racist,5,22 December 2016,"Having visited Istanbul and other Turkish cities, I have a different impression of the people of that country. Unfortunately, as I write, there is big trouble, with violence reigning. In this movie, a guy stupidly tries to smuggle drugs onto an airplane. He is captured and put in a Turkish prison. Did he have any doubt what would happen to him when he did this. I remember a ""Sixty Minutes"" feature on a couple twenty-something girls who were given free passage to Thailand. All they had to do was bring a package back. They will be in prison until they are thirty-five. Don't mess around in foreign countries. Americans don't always get their way. Of course, I am no expert on Turkish prisons, but the portrayal of the prisoners and the Turkish people is utterly racist. I thought the movie was exciting but it is overriden by trying to feel positively about this guy.",Midnight Express
5,kosmasp,On time (not?),8,30 August 2020,"While I try to read as little as possible about movies I'm about to watch (and this is the first time I saw this the other day), it is quite difficult not knowing where most of the movie will be playing out. Which makes it even more difficult to understand certain decisions the main character makes. While most are at least understandable, there is a running scene relatively early on, that does not make sense at all.It's made even worse when you think about it almost not mattering in the grand scheme of things. Not that our main actor would know, but still. And talking about knowing, this is based on a true story. Don't roll your eyes (if you did) - although I understand the sentiment. One thing the director makes clear in the special features, this may be based on something that happened, but what you see in the film is quite heightened. One of the people who heightened it, got an Oscar for it. Oliver Stone - and is seems to have helped his career a lot.The movie itself is quite draining and a tour de force, for the viewer but also the persons involved. This is also r-rated for a reason. It is not for the squeaish or faint of hearted. A lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration and a lot of anger ... the system can and will work against you at times ... or is it always? Whatever you make of this, it left a mark and while not without flaws, is disturbing and good enough to give you nightmares or pause to think/reflect",Midnight Express
6,classicsoncall,"""There ain't nobody here who's innocent.""",8,27 June 2019,"I recall how horrified I was at the treatment of Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) in prison when I first saw this picture during it's original release. Part of that had to do with the fact that I was about his age in the movie at the time, and couldn't imagine going through an ordeal like his myself. Not that it would ever happen because I wouldn't be smuggling drugs out of a foreign country, but you get the point. The issue was made in the film that Billy's punishment far outweighed the crime, and I don't know if that would have been the case if his arrest and imprisonment occurred in America. But he certainly wouldn't have been subject to the harsh prison conditions and abject brutality that he was forced to undergo in a foreign country like Turkey. He did himself no favors of course when he went on his courtroom tirade against the judge and prosecuting attorney during the retrial. Combined with the original infraction, it should be a worthy lesson to all about committing a crime in a foreign country where the rule of law can be anything but. I don't know anything about the real incident that was the basis for this movie. If Billy's Hayes experience was even half as bad as depicted in the story, it would be a sad commentary on man's inhumanity to man, and an object lesson in demonstrating how one ought not to stray from the straight and narrow in a culture that doesn't value human life the way we do.",Midnight Express
7,lee_eisenberg,"Hopefully, we've all learned to avoid getting thrown in jail in the Third World.",8,14 February 2006,"The movie that made director Alan Parker really famous tells the true -if somewhat exaggerated - story of Billy Hayes (Brad Davis), who got thrown into a hellish Turkish prison after he was caught smuggling hashish. The movie starts off by setting up the historical context. The first thing that you see is Billy and his hubby Susan (Irene Miracle) reading about Janis Joplin's death in the paper. But once he gets arrested, then things get ugly. You'll need a strong stomach to watch this movie. That of course means that they did really well with it in every way. Oliver Stone was one of the screenwriters. Also starring Randy Quaid, John Hurt, and Bo Hopkins.",Midnight Express
8,jboothmillard,Midnight Express,8,13 October 2009,"From BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Sir Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone, Fame, Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita), I noticed this film for being five stars out of five, and having two good stars in the cast. Based on a true story, Billy Hayes (BAFTA and twice Golden Globe nominated Brad Davis) is arrested in Turkey trying to smuggle drugs. The Turkish authorities sentence him to four years in prison, to make an example of him. While in prison, Hayes meets fellow inmates Jimmy Booth (Randy Quaid) and Max (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John Hurt), who have plans for some sort of escape attempt. Hayes does have two opportunities to get out of prison: appealing with his lawyer, family and the American government; or the ""Midnight Express"" (prison slang for an inmate's escape attempt). He does attempt to escape from the prison with Booth and Max, removing large stones from the wall and trying to find an escape in the sewers below. But this backfires when the removed stones are discovered. Hayes then ruins his chances of getting out by biting the tongue off a prison informant. He is placed in a mental asylum, and after another escape attempt involving bribing, he is nearly raped by a guard. Hayes kills this guard, accidentally, steals his uniform, and manages to walk out the front gate. The final text says that he managed to cross the border of Greece and get home three weeks later. Also starring Golden Globe nominated Irene Miracle as Susan, Bo Hopkins as Tex, Paolo Bonacelli as Rifki, Paul L. Smith as Hamidou, Norbert Weisser as Erich, Mike Kellin as Mr. Hayes, Franco Diogene as Yesil and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's Kevork Malikyan as the Prosecutor. Davis is magnificent as the prisoner you can sort of sympathise with, Hurt and Quaid are also fantastic support. It has very hard-hitting material, including the brutality of the law and authorative system, it is from what I've read not completely accurate in its facts, but you cannot be compelled by it, a fantastic prison drama. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Giorgio Moroder and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Oliver Stone, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. John Hurt was number 27 on The 100 Greatest British Actors. Very good!",Midnight Express
9,ma-cortes,Fascinating and violent prison movie partially based on true events,7,25 August 2010,"This excellent movie deals with the American Bill Hayes (performedd by the late Brad Davis ) who was detained smuggling two kilograms of hashish while trying to board the flight along with his girlfriend (Irene Miracle) from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1970 . He was condemned to four years in a hellish Turkish prison on a drug possession charge, but his sentence was later extended Turkish courts decide to make an example of him , sentencing him to more than 30 years in jail . Hayes has two opportunities for getting freedom : the appeals made by his advocate at law , his father (Mike Kellin), and the American government, or the ""Midnight Express¨ . Meanwhile, Hayes suffers incredible cruelty and sadism before his escape in 1975. It deals upon horrible conditions of prisoners and grueling efforts of the meager captives to survive ,confrontating mistreats, rampage and continuous violence with punches , lashes, knocks and incredible tortures . The most part of the movie takes place into four walls of a jail , criminal court ,yard and sewers involving and executing the preparatives of the escape . The picture tells the authentic experiences of convicts who live in a brutal Turkish prison that is a hell on the earth , reflecting the hardship existence of the inmates . We have seen men tortured , harassed and humiliated in a gaol where rules the strongest law . The film narrates physical mistreats , tortures and the preparation and execution of the getaway , but also friendship and comradeship . Later on , Hayes erupts in an explosion of self-defensive violence in some breathtaking scenes.This powerful prison movie well produced by prestigious producer David Puttnam contains thought-provoking drama , thrills , chills and lots of violence . Sensational performances from the magnificent starring Brad Davis who suffers an emotional brutalization and perfect support cast as the junkie John Hurt , the nasty sneaker Paolo Bonacelli who causes in Hayes an explosion of violence and Paul Smith as sadist warden who uses unthinkable tortures and brutality. This is a superbly crafted film though is also intensely manipulative and xenophobic . Interesting screenplay deserving an Oscar by Oliver Stone though full of offensive stereotypes against Turks and not faithful to Bill Hayes's true deeds . Evocative and dark cinematography by Michael Seresin . Unforgettable score by Giorgio Moroder with excessive use of synthesizer and electronic music. Skill and riveting direction by Alan Parker with some sensationalist touch ; this is his first big success , subsequently he made other hits such as ¨Fame¨, ¨The Wall¨,¨Angel heart¨, ¨Missisipi Burning¨ , among them. Rating : Very good , above average . Worthwhile watching .",Midnight Express
10,moonspinner55,It's a masochist's dream come true...,6,30 May 2005,"Bearing little resemblance to the book, or in fact to real life, ""Midnight Express"" exists in a sadomasochist bubble, completely removed from anything concrete. Even on its own terms, it makes no sense. With heavy homosexual overtones throughout, our hero (played by Brad Davis) turns down gay sex as if he's above it, yet director Alan Parker revels in the sexual imagery (what with Davis standing spread out in front of the law or being pawed at by sexual brute Paul Smith). Are we to believe that this American tourist in Turkey, jailed for attempting to smuggle out hashish, is some kind Arc Angel, remaining pure throughout the carnage? Oliver Stone adapted the non-fiction book, and won an Oscar, but he waters down an already taut account (or maybe it was watered down for him). This is not to say the film doesn't have horrifying or fascinating passages (it does command attention), but the ""plot"", as such, doesn't hang together. The movie has a dated look, and dated music, causing it to resemble an old porny picture, and the performances are variable. **1/2 from ****",Midnight Express
11,Quinoa1984,"as a story and emotional experience in and of itself, it's depressing, manipulative, and highly charged drama",8,22 October 2004,"I've never been to Turkey, or Istanbul, and I can hold no claims as to what it must be like for a person, American or otherwise, to endure time in one of their country's prisons. But the job of the filmmaker is not necessarily to get the facts down pat and present them as such. It's to present a story and make it appropriate for the dramatization. Oliver Stone, who wrote the script for this and went on to controversy in bringing the true story of Jim Garrison's trial of Clayshaw, Morrison's life with the Doors, and the late president Nixon, knew at 31 that taking what was in the source and bringing it to a life that any audience could understand emotionally was what was important. And he, along with director Alan Parker, deliver this with conviction, if not greatness. The story of William Hayes is ugly, as depicted in the film, and despite the fact that the real Hayes has said the depiction of some of the characters in the film is not as it was, it does not deter it for myself in the pure emotional intake.The story at first does not sound like it will have a happy outcome- Hayes (Davis, a shattering, torn performance) tries to smuggle Hash for friends back on long island, gets caught, and is thrown in jail 'as an example' among others in a Turkish prison. He's abused, and witnesses multiples abuses of prisoners young and old, and once he realizes he won't get out nearly as soon as he thought, he and a couple of other prisoners (Randy Quaid and John Hurt, both superb in supporting roles), plan to escape, or rather 'take the midnight express'. What occurs from there is what makes up the bulk of the drama, the hurt, and a 'version' of the truth in the Turskish prison system.The thing to keep in mind in dealing with a film like Midnight Express, is that in cinematic terms, Parker and Stone pull off their goals whether or not they depict the 'truth' to its fullest extent. They follow the book, and on that count they try their best to bring an adaptation. From that end, I found that it was compelling, if at times almost too heavy and, oddly enough, masochistic. But what comes through strongest, after the outright point of view of the script, are the performances. Hurt is one of only several truly convincing screen junkies in movie history. The actor that plays the burly guard in the prison is absolutely terrifying. And Quaid and Hayes fill their roles finitely. The music, ironically to me, is the one Oscar-winning drag, which sometimes adds pre-80's sounding music that doesn't fit as maybe it could've. But besides that, Midnight Express is overall a work of concentrated drama, that tries to not affect just the American collective conscious, but the world's as well. Years from now, people who have no idea what the prison system in that country or others was like, can at least have an idea, if not altogether to the truth.",Midnight Express
12,wes-connors,Brad Davis Makes You Pull for Billy,7,27 July 2011,"Underwear model perfect Brad Davis (as William ""Billy"" Hayes) gets caught trying to smuggle hash into America, and is terrorized in a Turkish prison. This is based on the true story, and a very good one. The real Billy Hayes authored book ""Midnight Express"" that led to this film was responsible for alerting millions of people about the dangers of attempting to smuggle drugs out of a foreign country. Generations thought twice about pulling a stunt like this, after hearing Mr. Hayes' account. A quick comparison between book and movie will reveal much of what occurs in this film is fictionalized...The tongue-lashing and final rape attempt never happened, though they sure command your attention. The weird, almost ""Zen"" romance did happen - but, this story leaves you the impression no actual sex acts occurred (one tiny edit would change the relationship to absolutely sexual, given surrounding scenes). That, and the otherworldly psych ward are too mystical. Despite faults, ""Midnight Express"" was nominated for six ""Oscars"" (and won what seem to be the unlikeliest). While he's burdened with serious deviations from the original character, Mr. Davis really makes you pull for Billy.******* Midnight Express (8/31/78) Alan Parker ~ Brad Davis, John Hurt, Randy Quaid, Paul Smith",Midnight Express
13,hitchcockthelegend,"I'm Billy Hayes, well at least I used to be.",8,16 February 2012,"Midnight Express is directed by Alan Parker and adapted to screenplay by Oliver Stone. It is loosely based on Billy Hayes' book of the same name. It tells of American Hayes' (Brad Davis) arrest and subsequent conviction for trying to smuggle hashish out of Istanbul, Turkey, for which he was sent to a hellish Turkish prison to serve his time. It also stars Randy Quaid, John Hurt, Paul L. Smith and Irene Miracle. Music is scored by Giorgio Moroder and cinematography is by Michael Seresin.Although controversy followed it due to its portrayals of the Turkish people, Midnight Express is today still a raw and uncompromising experience. In fact if we strip away Moroder's Oscar winning electro bubbling score, the film holds up as a fresh and pertinent piece of film making. Parker doesn't cut corners or attempt any sort of Hollywood gloss, he keeps it grimy, oppressive and harsh in its telling, whilst the hand-held camera work keeps things jittery, harmonising with Billy Hayes and his fellow cons' state of mind. The narrative unfurls from Billy's POV, and it's mostly in a downwards direction, with that it's hard to call the picture essential entertainment, we are after all observant to mental and physical abuse, with the disintegration of the human spirit front and centre. Billy's alienation is deftly crafted by Parker, where the non use of subtitles for the Turkish characters helps us to feel as isolated as Billy was. However, there's the odd glimmer of hope and humanity, courtesy of Billy's interactions within the few friendships he forms, and of course there's the overriding urge to see him escape his hell.Stone won the Academy Award for his screenplay, and even though it has been frowned upon for some of the perceived bile unleashed on the Turks, it mostly excels on a human's under duress basis. The interactions between prisoners is often solemn and edgy, due to the characters being from different walks of life, while much of Hayes' outpourings of emotion have conviction by way of the words; even if one particular ""speech"" is ill advised and over the top. Cast are excellent, where Davis calls on the sadness in his real life upbringing to give a performance of real intensity, while Hurt and Quaid are beaten down by drug fuelled resignation and tempestuousness respectively. It has flaws, and the over dramatising of certain events tends to deviate from a real story that hardly needed extra oomph, but always Midnight Express remains a harrowing and potent piece of cinema. 8/10",Midnight Express
14,Theo Robertson,Fictional Account Of A True Story,7,15 November 2012,"I read the book MIDNIGHT EXPRESS many years ago , but didn't actually see the film until it was broadcast on network TV in the mid 90's . Of course any film adaption of any book will be the inferior article but the problem with this film is .....It's entirely made up !!!!!The film follows the book until Billy is arrested then for some unexplained reason the script decides go its own way !!!MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! First of all Max is a composite character. He's several people rolled into one and none them were beaten half to death and left to languish in the psyciatric hospital.Nor did any of them have a cat that was lynched Billy biting the Turk's tongue out. Hard hitting scene. Didn't happenin reality Hamidou. A sadistic and sexually deviant prison guard. Entirely based in the realms of Oliver Stone's imagination. His attempted rape of Billy and being Killed by him is fictionalAs irritating as these inventions are , the worst aspect of the film is Billy's whining self pity. The Billy Hayes of the book is brutal in his honesty , never ever forgetting that he broke the 11th commandment: Though shalt not get caught; an attitude he still carries to this day. The Billy of the film seems to have given into victim culture and therefore doesn't deserve our sympathy. If you can't do the time ,don't do the crime.Strangely Oliver Stone won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for his script. Surely he should have won it for ORIGINAL screenplay ? But despite its flaws MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a tense ,involving, tough film. Just make sure you read the book AFTER seeing the film",Midnight Express
15,jotix100,Drug Trafficking,8,25 November 2004,"Billy Hayes is a dumb American man trying to make a fast buck, thinking he can get away with murder. How could anyone take the chance of smuggling the drugs taped around his belly? How stupid could this guy be, acting in such an uncool way, as he appears so nervous going through passport control? He was a dead give away, as we see him perspiring profusely in front of the local authorities. It's unfortunate that some people see Billy Hayes as a hero, when he is nothing but a misguided young man trying to capitalize on what he thought was the perfect scheme.What happens to Billy Hayes is chronicled by English film maker Alan Parker. He, and his screen writer take the main idea of the book and change it to give us a horror story, and in the process, he makes the fatal mistake in thinking that by giving the viewer a glance about what Billy has to endure in prison doesn't fit the crime he committed.Mr. Parker and his main collaborator, Oliver Stone, have created a film that has the tone of a documentary; the emphasis is on the cruelty experienced in prison. Actually, the director and the screen play, place the blame in the Turkish prison system, but actually, they succeed in making a hero of this idiotic man.Hayes was a coward and an opportunist who believed he would be able to get away with his crime without being made accountable for it, as he would get a profit from the sale of the drug. Mr. Hayes never took into account what he was doing or that the drug he was smuggling would do to other people. He deserved much more time in prison, or if he was going to deal in drugs, he would have been better off doing it in his own country, where maybe, with the help of a power attorney, he wouldn't even have served time for his crime.While the film makes thrilling film making, it's not realistic at all. Look at how the inmates live within prison. Compared to other countries, life in that prison was not so bad! The prisoners can get food from outside, pay their way for basic necessities; it was almost like living in a flea bag hotel in a foreign country.Brad Davis makes a puzzling Billy. At times, he is up to the task, but at others he is not convincing, in my humble opinion. The multi national cast is excellent. Much of what goes in prison is depicted in full detail.Perhaps ""Midnight Express"" made a better impression when it came out than right now. It's still worth a look at it and to watch it as a thriller, but nothing to do with reality.",Midnight Express
16,zardoz-13,"The Message Is: ""Don't Smuggle Hash Out of Turkey!""",10,26 November 2008,"British director Alan Parker depicts the traumatic ordeal of an American citizen seized for drugs in a Middle Eastern country whose laws make an example of him for the ills visited on them by U.S. Foreign policy in ""The Midnight Express,"" one of the most powerful and important films of 1978, starring Brad Davis and John Hurt. According to the film's closing credits, on May 18, 1978, ""Midnight Express"" was shown to an audience of world press at the Cannes Film Festival . . . 43 days later, the United States and Turkey entered into formal negotiations for the exchange of prisoners. Initially, the Turkish government tried to prevent the film from being produced. Indeed, even after the ""Midnight Express"" came out, the Turkish government banned the film from being shown in theatres.Based on a bestselling autobiographical account by Billy Hayes, a tourist arrested in 1970 for trying to smuggle hash out of Turkey, the film traces Billy's descent into the hellish oblivion of Turkey's penal system and his miraculous escape. Not surprisingly, ""Midnight Express"" stretched the truth and even Billy Hayes has admitted that the filmmakers took advantage of dramatic license to heighten the dramatic impact of the material. As directed by Alan Parker and scripted by Oliver Stone, ""Midnight Express"" indicts Turkish law for its cruel, inhuman treatment of prisoners and celebrates Hayes' courage and will to survive. Billy expresses the film's theme: ""the quality of mercy is measured in a society by its sense of justice.Briefly, American tourist Billy (Brad Davis of ""Querelle"") tries to smuggle $200 worth of hashish out of Turkey. The authorities catch him, however, during a routine search before he boards a commercial airliner, arrest him, and sentence him to prison. This sequence is pretty harrowing stuff. Six months later, Billy stands trial and receives a three-year sentence. The prison that they stick him in is a version of Hell on earth. With only 53 days left of his sentence, Billy learns to his horror that the authorities have scheduled a new trial for him. The sentence this time is life imprisonment commuted to 30 years. During his incarceration, Hayes befriends an Englishman, Max (John Hurt of ""Heaven's Gate""), and a fellow American, psychotic Jimmy Booth (Randy Quaid of ""The Last Detail""), and contends with one of the cinema's most sadistic villains, Hamidou (Paul L. Smith of ""Red Sonja""), who loves to wield a paddle and beat the daylights out of unruly convicts. Undoubtedly, ""Midnight Express"" ranks Smith's most memorable role. You'll never forget the scene when the barrel-chested Hamidou marches out with a chubby little child clutching each hand to inflict torture on an unfortunate inmate. He snaps his head one way to remove the sweat from his brow and starts swinging with a vengeance. Imagine Bud Spencer of ""Trinity"" fame in a foul mood and you will get the picture.Parker and Stone have reconstructed the events of Hayes' book so they follow a logical progression. Otherwise, apart from two scenes, the film generally keeps the book intact. Those scenes include the movie's ending, which differs drastically from the book's ending. And there is a brutal fight scene in which a prison informer is killed and his tongue bitten out. Another slight difference is that the book had no central villain, but the film provides the sadistic guard Hamidou who beats prisoners on the feet with a two-by-four. Credit director Parker with vigorous, imaginative direction. There is not one bad minute in this exciting film. To enhance the realism of the action, Parker has shot it in semi-documentary style with occasional narration. The editing also deserves mention; much of the film had to be lensed outside of Turkey, and the filmmakers have smoothly integrated shots of Turkey with location shots made on the island of Malta.One of the best surprises in ""Midnight Express"" is Giorgio Moroder's electrifying music. He captures effectively the atmosphere of the film and the hostile Turkish setting. His use of pulsating music during an early chase when Billy tries to elude his captors exemplifies his great talent. ""The Midnight Express"" is not a film for the squeamish; the language is harsh and the content is frank with some homosexuality. One of the most depressing scenes occurs when Billy's girlfriend visits him in prison. A thick glass wall separates them. Billy begs her to press her breasts again the glass and he masturbates with one hand on the glass where her breast is flattened out and the other . . . while she cries in despair and humiliation. The finale when Billy tangles with the evil Hamidou will have you on the edge of your seat. If it has a fault, it may be that it is too reactionary and paints a biased view of Turkey. However, one that ""The Midnight Express"" makes painfully clear: when you're busted over there, you are in for the hassle of your life.",Midnight Express
17,grantss,Great prison drama,8,22 April 2015,"Great prison drama.Loosely based on a true story (many details are changed), the movie revolves around a man, Billy Hayes, who is imprisoned in Istanbul for drug possession/smuggling. Director Alan Parker and writer Oliver Stone slowly ratchet up the tension, scene by scene. Initially Hayes' predicament does not seem so bad - the Turkish police are depicted as harmless, almost buffoons - but as the movie goes on it becomes more and more claustrophobic as Hayes' position becomes more and more dire.

Billy learns to trust no one, though befriends a fellow American played by Randy Quaid, who is even more of a hard luck case than he is. Billy gets more desperate as time passes, though his infrequent visits with his father & girlfriend do help. Billy must hang on despite his bleak situation if he is to survive, even if he has to kill...Alan Parker creates a bleak and harsh atmosphere in this true-life account, though sympathy is limited since Billy was guilty of a serious crime, though whether he deserved his nightmarish prison is of course another matter. Film is so relentlessly downbeat for two hours that it wears the viewer down. Not really an inspirational story of the triumph of the will, more like a cautionary tale about drug smuggling, and that may be its sole lasting worth.",Midnight Express

21,The_Void,Great true life prison drama,8,23 January 2006,"I didn't go into this film with massively high hopes - but I don't know why, as Midnight Express is surely one of the best 'hidden gems' that I've seen! The film is almost three decades old now, making it strange that it hasn't turned up in this decade with a better reputation. Starring Brad Davis and directed by Alan Parker, this British production follows the frightening idea of being trapped in a foreign prison. Adding to that is the fact that it's actually based a true story. The real life Billy Hayes (Davis' character in this film) wrote the book 'Midnight Express', from which this film takes it's inspiration. The idea of being caught breaking the law in another country is handled well in this film, and Alan Parker always ensures that the prison environment is dark and claustrophobic, with the focus being on the state of mind of the main character at all times. It's very easy to get into this film, and the linear plot helps this massively. These days it's customary to mess around with plotting in an attempt to be as original as possible; but Midnight Express proves how a straight story can allow the audience to connect with the characters.Midnight Express benefits from an array of great actors in the central roles. Brad Davis, as mentioned, takes the lead role and manages to capture just the right amount of naivety and self-preservation to make the role believable. He is joined by big name actors Randy Quaid and John Hurt, while smaller name actors such as Bo Hopkins, Paolo Bonacelli and Mike Kellin give it their all in their respective parts. For justice to work the crime must fit the punishment; and this is something that makes this film obviously based on a book by the prisoner himself. We never seen the main character admit that he's done anything wrong, and the focus is always put on him wanting to get out of jail. This is wrong in a way, as if people were allowed to get away with crime; there would be no law - but on the other hand, it allows us to get into the accused's head a little more, and this ultimately makes the final payoff far more rewarding. Overall, I'm not saying this film is without problems; but it's definitely well worth seeing. The acting and directing are fabulous, and this film also benefits from being based on a great true story. I'd maybe even label it 'must see'.",Midnight Express

23,MovieAddict2016,A harrowing and powerful film,9,9 April 2006,"Loosely based on the true story of Billy Hayes (collected from his book of the same title), Alan Parker's ""Midnight Express"" contains some of the most effective and rightly iconic scenes in all of film history -- the opening with the heartbeats devoid of any soundtrack; the ""Oh Billy!"" segment; and of course the entire idea of Turkish prisons being terrible and abusive.Hayes' story was elaborative to begin with and Oliver Stone -- not exactly one to be known for sticking close to the truth -- exaggerates it even more; so far, indeed, that it almost becomes fictional. The real Hayes had no girlfriend, was not raped in jail, DID have a homosexual relationship with another inmate (the film shows him denying the advances), and escaped at night by sea.However, as a film this is probably one of the great motion pictures of the 1970s. Parker (""Angel Heart"") is a brilliant visual director and uses much of the same imagery he would use later on in his career. For example, take note of the fans in the sweltering heat inside the courtroom. They'd be used again in ""Angel Heart."" Brad Davis gives a wonderful performance and convincingly devolves from a naive American student to a crazy lunatic by the time he enters the insane asylum. John Hurt's performance was also worthy of its Oscar nomination.Overall, this is very much a product of its time -- it's depressing, bleak, and almost painful to watch; and because it's a Stone screenplay, there's a lot of politics at play. However, the overall film is breathtaking, thrilling and unpredictable (to a point) -- it's definitely worth seeing at least once in your lifetime.",Midnight Express
24,lasttimeisaw,"If you are not a Turk, I do recommend you to give it a try",8,22 December 2016,"UK polymath Alan Parker's second feature, an Oscar BEST PICTURE finalist, notching up 6 nominations with 2 wins, one for Giorgio Moroder's first-ever synthesized soundtrack and another for Oliver Stone's adapted screenplay. Speciously based on Bill Hayes' personal experience in the Turkish prison (from his nonfiction book of the same title), MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a sensationalized account of the searing injustice in Turkish penal system, subjected to Hayes (a heart-throbbing Davis), an American college student, who is arrested in Istanbul on October 6, 1970, for attempting to smuggle 2 kg of hashish out of Turkey. By saying ""sensationalized"" is not an over-statement, since various sources (including Parker and Stone) have admitted that fabricated characterization was excessively adopted to spice up the story (to a point of evoking a soupçon of orientalism and American chauvinism), and Hayes himself also confirms that the movie's depiction is a far cry from what really happened (including the gay overtone, which is allowed with a very contained but tender glimpse before being officially nipped in the bud). So, at then, in spite of its huge success in the West, the film was severely censured for its vilification and racist misrepresentation of Turkish people, which was bound to hurt its reputation, because, if one can turn a blind eye on its politically incorrect spin, say, the story is purely fictitious, then the film per se can be more unbiasedly viewed as a pulsating prison drama par excellence, an arousing polemic against inhuman treatment and conditions in the prison, plus a sometimes torture-porn, anchored by an arresting impersonation from Brad Davis. Bill is caught red-handedly for his own air-headed action, after another harebrained decision to take flight when he sees fit, he knows he must swallow the bitter pills to serve jail time, at first, it is 4 years which he considers fair and learns to lie low under the high-handed atrocity of chief guard Hamidou (Smith, a towering symbol of sadistic monstrosity) until when there is only 53 days left, his sentence is wantonly overturned by Turkish High Court (to set an example also in the wake of the strained and delicate relation between Turkey and USA then), and this time, it adds up to 30 years, a demoralized Bill harangues the court by calling out ""all Turks are pigs"", his diction is racist and radical, but it is such a deafening manifesto emitting from the unfairly abused, one simply cannot deny it is self-righteously touching. Days behind the bars (in a distinctly reconstructed Sagmalcilar Prison, filmed in Malta) become unbearable for Bill and his fellow Western inmates, Jimmy Booth (Quaid), an American petty pilferer, and the British heroin addict Max (Hurt), they decide to carry out the so-called ""midnight express"", a prison slang for escape attempt, but the plan is prematurely scuppered by Rifki (Bonacelli), a shifty Turk squealer, the ensuing ruckus sends both Bill and Max in the ward for the insane, a true purgatory where one subsumes himself into a walking dead among others, it mise- en-scène startlingly reveals the sub-human circumstances of the habitat, silently deplores the barbarism enacted behinds those closed doors. The unexpected visit of Bill's American girlfriend Susan (Irene Miracle, what a great name!) becomes the game-changer, it revitalizes Bill's will to escape the living hell (with a little help from Susan's bared bust too), thanks to a coup de théâtre (again, not what happened in reality), Bill manages to get his revenge and also walk out of the prison, eventually reunites with his family in USA, over a stretch of 5 years from being arrest in the airport. Parker effectively deploys the auditory aid of Bill's heartbeats in both the opening sequences where he has to face the airport checkup and the final step of his escape exploit, to retain a structural coordination, whereas in the bulk of the interior scenes, the interplay among actors has been mapped out with attentive closeness and Moroder's score is eerily apposite to synchronize with the atmosphere runs the gamut from scathing, indignant to compassionate and enthralling. Brad Davis is snubbed for at least an Oscar nomination for his fearless screen debut, during the segment where he tussles with Rifki, his explosive impulsion simmered with raw rage and resentment is simply transfixing, yet he can also be divinely empathetic in his invective without sounding tub-thumping. Indeed, there is no question why Fassbinder wanted to cast him in his swan-song QUERELLE (1982), he is a walking hot rod, yet, both would untimely exit the world due to drug abuse. An infirm John Hurt receives his first Oscar nomination for his Method embodiment of a sympathetic character slowly rotten in the corner of the madhouse, it is an impressive feat and well-deserving the laurels, a typically unobtrusive supporting turn without over-egging the pudding. Fairly enough, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a tremendously engrossing film, overtly, takes its poetic license too broadly in a way only eclipses its own cinematic achievement and powerhouse performances, if you are not a Turk, I do recommend you to give it a try.",Midnight Express
25,sddavis63,"Full Of Intensity, But Lacking In Accuracy",8,16 August 2003,"First let me say that this is a great movie. It kept me glued to the screen all the way through. Having said that, the biggest disappointment in the movie is director Oliver Stone's own admission that he took great liberties with the story of William Hayes, the young American sentenced to thirty years in a Turkish prison for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country, and the reality is that what we see in the movie isn't much like what actually happened. (My understanding is that the language used in the film isn't even Turkish. It's apparently Maltese, because the movie had to be filmed in Malta, since Turkey refused to allow filming there because they considered the script so anti-Turkish.) The portrayal of the Turks is also a bit of a problem. I'm not trying to suggest that life in a Turkish prison is easy. But the purpose of the movie seemed to be to try to elicit from the viewer sympathy for Hayes' plight. I'm not defending brutality, but the fact of the matter is that Hayes did this to himself. The Turks didn't force him to smuggle hashish out of the country. If he had obeyed the law there would have been no problem. I suspect that the Turks weren't as bad as Stone depicted them (although I'm sure it was no country club.)I really liked Brad Davis in the role of Hayes. He seemed to capture the character perfectly (which is probably why it is the role that defined - and probably in the long run hurt - his acting career.) He quite literally carried the movie. No one else particularly stood out to me. The scenes in the psychiatric ward were extremely disturbing, as was the scene in which Hayes is visited by his girlfriend Susan (Irene Miracle).The movie left a lot of open questions (unfortunate for a supposedly true story.) We aren't told what happened to Hayes' friend Max (John Hurt), who he left behind in prison after promising to come back for him (I assume Hayes never helped him, but I have no idea), and although Stone does a good job of depicting Hayes' escape from the prison, my understanding is that the story of his escape to Greece is quite dramatic, but it isn't even dealt with by the movie.I have no problem stating that this is a great movie, but it certainly loses points for its questionable reflection of reality and for leaving so many loose ends.8/10",Midnight Express
26,ElMaruecan82,The greatest prison movie ... sublimated by an unforgettable score ...,10,10 February 2011,"The iconic score from Giorgio Moroder still echoes the sound of an eternal moral battle between hope and desperateness, about standing against adversity, or dying slowly when the light of hope is weakening. And ""Midnight Express"" communicates these emotions through one of the greatest male performances ever, from Brad Davis, as Billy Hayes, a stranger in a hostile country.And this is the point to be cleared first, for intellectual honesty's sake. Till now, the movie is held responsible for having paved the way to a whole misconception about Turkish prisons in general and Turks more particularly (ironically, this is how the movie lurched so fast into Pop-Culture). But I don't think we should blame the film for having depicted a population in such an extreme way for two reasons. First, it's against the system more than the people. Secondly, dramatization is a key element, had the movie been more politically correct, it would have probably been less impacting without gaining more accuracy. Dramatization is affection : like many men thought twice before having a mistress, after they watched ""Fatal Attraction"", I'm sure the movie was a lesson to drug smugglers.And as ludicrous as it sounds, a sincere inaccuracy is better than a hypocritical tolerance. After all, aren't we all biased, too? And aren't the others? If you put the film into perspective, Turkey had a very bad reputation because of men like Billy Hayes, and he was chosen by destiny to take all the punishment, to set an example. Billy had to commit this mistake to realize that. And we put ourselves in his shoes, we follow Billy in the toilets where he desperately tries to hide his anxiety, we feel our heart beating as fast as his. Alan Parker's direction perfectly emphasizes the whole paranoid feeling, it's like we got so high everything became suspect. When the eyes of Billy betray him and the guards search him, we feel like carrying hashish too, then, when Billy raises his arms and the ring of guards point guns at him, we know the doors of a hellish journey have just been opened. The empathy between the viewer and Billy is so strong that from this point, both feelings are combined, including, the hate against the Turkish system.I insist on the word 'system' because Billy is indeed the scapegoat of a system where corruption and legality flirt together in an obscene masquerade, like the funny but meaningful image of a judge staring at a girl's sexy legs in the press room while Billy's is pleading for his cause. It's a crooked system disguising Billy's punishment as a victory in the war against drug smuggling. Billy accepts the punishment after a heart-breaking leaving scene with his father; he's ready to wait for four long years. He befriends Jimmy (Randy Quaid) a hot-headed American who's got only one thing in head, escape and Max, the English (John Hurt), a smooth talking, pot-smoker and detached intellectual. During this time, as I said, we –as viewers- feel a strong attachment to Billy, we can't wait for him getting out of prison as we're embarked with him in the same hell. And we see Turkish people the way he does, yes, they are vile, and corrupted, but don't forget the movie sitting in the throne of IMDb's Top 250 doesn't feature the nicest warden and chief guard in the world either. Again, my point is to put things into perspective, Billy's hate is a reaction to the hostility aimed at him. Billy's considered as ""Ayip"", impure, from the start. We can't perceive the brutal Hamidou and the sneaky Rifki's with other eyes. This is the power of ""Midnight Express"", something I don't think any other prison movies achieved, making us feel exactly like the central character whose emotions are magnificently expressed through Moroder's unforgettable score, my favorite after ""The Godfather"".""Midnight Express"" is definitely one of these films where the score and the story are inseparable: the iconic chase theme is like the rhythm of our own heart pounding as we're running with Billy. Also take the scene with the Swedish prisoner, despite the disturbing intimacy, the music helped me to empathize, to wonder how I would have handled these four years without expressing some feelings. Beyond the music, ""Midnight Express"" is one of these great cinematic achievements where everything is so perfectly combined we don't watch the film, we feel it. The prison's ugliness exudes from a beautiful cinematography and the hostility of Billy's world is so masterfully directed, you can feel the dirt on the beds, and smell the sweat of other prisoners, not to mention the perfect acting that made the realism of the story even scarier.The only element that seems to disturb is the script, but if the music is the heart of the film, the script is the soul. Yes, it's politically incorrect, yes after his sentence was extended to perpetuity, Billy delivered one of the most racist rants ever said, but this is not where the movie sinned: as I said, this is the movie's sincerity speaking. It's a gut wrenching speech, because this is not Billy talking, this is the desperation of someone who's got nothing to lose, who played the game and lost it. And more than that, this is Billy's turning point from which, he and Jimmy and Max will try to catch the Midnight Express, the metaphorical train leading to freedom, while they are already standing on a less imaginary stairway to hell, preparing Billy for one of the most chilling, and realistic descents into madness, ever portrayed in film. So sad, such an amazing actor and promising career had to leave us so soon.""Midnight Express"" transcends its setting, and sublimates any critical aspect into an intense story about the power of human spirit struggling in a hostile environment ... a misunderstood masterpiece, the greatest prison movie, and one of the best of the 70's.",Midnight Express
27,MOscarbradley,Life in a Turkish prison.,2,2 April 2017,"There's no denying that ""Midnight Express"" is a well made movie. Its director, Alan Parker, is probably the flashiest of British film-makers; the kinetic thrust he applies to his movies makes the work of his predecessors like Lean and Carol Reed seem positively pedestrian but flash without substance amounts to very little. ""Midnight Express"" certainly has substance, (Oliver Stone won an Oscar for his screenplay), but it's still a very difficult film to like. When it came out accusations of xenophobia were rightly leveled at it; very few western made movies were ever so baldly critical of a European country as this was of Turkey, where everyone in authority is painted as a monster.It's the true story of Billy Hayes, arrested at Istanbul airport for smuggling drugs and sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish prison. The movie is really nothing more than a chronicle of the horrors he suffered before finally escaping and they are laid on thick and fast. Hayes was not innocent but over and over again the film tells us the punishment did not fit the crime and to prove the point Parker rubs our noses in the degradation and the extreme violence. It's a film not only without heroes but without characters we can empathize with unless, of course, you choose to empathize with Billy who endures every deprivation known to man.Brad Davis plays him as a wounded, weeping angel who is so much better than everyone around him. The camera lingers over his beautiful, battered body the way it might do in a porn film; there is less acting than ego on display. On the other hand there are two outstanding performances, from the late John Hurt, (Oscar nominated), as a drug addicted inmate and from the American actor Paul Smith as a sadistic Turkish prison guard; when he finally gets it the audience is invited to cheer and while the film is purported to be a 'true' story Stone apparently played fast and loose with the facts.Technically it's something of a marvel. DoP Michael Seresin makes the prison almost a thing of beauty while editor Gerry Hambling makes sure it moves very briskly indeed for over 2 hours. It was a massive success, winning 2 Oscars and being nominated for 4 more, including Best Picture. It also spawned a lot of gay Turkish prison jokes and put a lot of people off visiting the country for many years.",Midnight Express
28,g-bodyl,A Spiral Into Madness!,9,6 March 2015,"Midnight Express is one of Alan Parker's greatest cinematic achievements and it talks about the ruthless prison environment in Turkey as well as the corrupt and ineffective Turkish criminal system. Almost forty years after the film's release, this movie is very strong and relevant and it ranks just behind the Shawshank Redemption in my favorite prison-escape films. A very powerful film about a man's descent into madness as he tries to escape from his harsh reality.Alan Parker's film is about a college student named Billy Hayes who is detained at a Turkish flight due to possession of hashish. Originally sentenced to four years in prison, that gets changed because of the stronger smuggling laws. Now Billy must find a way to survive and board the midnight express.The acting gave the film the sense of powerfulness. Brad Davis is fantastic as Hayes. He gave some powerful speeches during the courtroom scenes that just might stay with me for awhile. John Hurt delivers a good performance as one of Hayes cellmates who specializes in medicine. I also liked Randy Quaid who brings a sense of optimism to his character and provided the will for the attempt to escape.Overall, Midnight Express is a very powerful movie about a harsh criminal system in the Middle East. One thing to note is that the movie does not shy down from the brutality, and that may be the criticisms this movie receives. Hardly any Turkish people are seen in a positive light, so that was a little odd. But one cannot deny the ineffectiveness of the court system in Turkey. A very good film with strong acting and a wonderful score by Giorgio Moroder.My Grade: A",Midnight Express
29,Dr_Coulardeau,A strong film against drugs and justice,10,4 April 2010,"This film is a manifesto in many ways and will remain a classic. A manifesto against drug trafficking. This activity is absurd, silly, only dictated by greed at all levels for something that has no justification whatsoever. And yet the real cause of the drama is in the tolerance some – like the father or the girl friend – have in front of the moderate use of such substances. But it is also a manifesto against the only answer that is leveled at that problem, in this case in Turkey, but it is not better anywhere else as for that, and that is repression. Repression makes the activity dangerous, hence all the more attractive because it becomes pure sports. What's more it is a manifesto against the cruelty of the punishment. The only objective of it is to make the person suffer physically first of all and to enjoy the slow and brutal degradation of the person. It also creates a social microcosm among prisoners that aims at developing fear and hatred. At the same time the surrounding microcosm of the prison wardens is a descent into a sadistic hellish cloaca that cannot in any way be redeemed. It is finally a manifesto against justice, and not only Turkish justice. The representative of the US consulate, or the lawyers, local or not, are not better. At the end we just wonder what we could do to really avoid the sadistic spiral of that vengeful vision of social management. And the only answer seems to be ""escape"".

There's no way around, saying it's a bad movie. Today, with people who still carry drugs across the country (idiots) it's a crying shame these people won't learn. Watch this movie to see what happens if you get caught with stuff in an unfamiliar and hostile country, cause this is what exactly happens here, where the late great Davis who plays, drug trafficker, Billy Hayes gets caught with hashish strapped around his body. From the opening scene, a screen shot of Turkey we know the scene is set for a great movie. Too in detail, we see Davis strapping the thick foiled bundles to his chest, while also priming himself not just at the airport in the bathroom, but in the mirror here. When caught, so begins a trapped hell in a sh..hole of a prison, where one brutish thug warden Hamoui (a fantastic Paul Smith) rules the roost. Randy Quaid, delivers a good performance like he usually does, as the angry, hyped and unthinking inmate while Hurt is unforgettable as the crazed and funny prisoner, Max, who eventually loses his marbles, reduced to a mumbling mummy. Let me tell you, there are a couple of heavy scenes to watch, involving beatings, and Stone has told a true story well with his great and detailed screenplay which is a much enjoyable read, all though I didn't read all of it, where small chunks were cut of the script, throughout, much so after the ending, that has him pulling a sham as a guard going home, before running and leaping up into a pause shot. The talented Stone knows how to write scripts, and even if it didn't win best script, in my opinion it's still a winner. Did I mention too Rifkie, a prisoner who bunks with Max and Billy, who a plays dirty, crawling prisoner, one scene forcing Billy to lose it, where he ends in the nutter section of the prison. The film is well shot. I really did love the shots with Billy making an escape from authorities where he's cornered by Hopkins. And when seeing Billy in the dock, receiving the ugly news about his fate, where his case is reviewed, again it just shows you what a stupid thing smuggling crap in is. I love a true story like this, when it's translated well to film, and Stone has a great grip on the handling on this story. It's a heavy and grim film, but emotionally powerful, if by the brilliant and sincere performances, like Hurt, David, and the guy playing his father.

33,bsmith5552,We've Got To Get Out of This Place!,8,12 November 2019,"Except for the ending, ""Midnight Express"" is a riveting prison movie. It's all about a young American Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who is caught in Istanbul, Turkey trying to smuggle 2 kilos of hashish out of the country. His girl friend Susan (Irene Miracle) is unaware of this and is allowed to leave.Despite arguments from the prosecutor (Kevork Malikyan) that Billy was a smuggler not merely in possession of the drug, he is sentenced to four years for possession. Inside the run down prison, Billy learns the ways of the institution. He is first beaten by brutal guard Hamidou (Paul L. Smith) who virtually runs the prison striking fear into the hearts of the inmates.Billy's father (Mike Kellin) and an oily Turkish lawyer Yesil (Franco Diogene) tell Billy that they will get him out. Billy befriends Jimmy Booth (Randy Quaid), Erich, a Swede (Norbert Weisser) and veteran inmate Max (John Hurt). Billy becomes ""extra friendly"" with Erich. Booth attempts an escape but is caught and beaten to within an inch of his life by the guards. After Erich is released Billy Booth and Max (recovered from his ordeal) plan an escape by removing two cement blocks and descending to the catacombs below.They manage to remove the blocks and go down below only to find that any escape route has been sealed off. Prison rat Rifki (Paolo Bonacelli) discovers the plot and reports it to Hamidou who immediately suspects Booth and carries him off for more brutal punishment. Booth does not return. Billy then loses it and attacks Rifki beating him senseless. As a result Billy is placed in the criminally insane section of the prison where he wanders aimlessly. He receives a visit from Susan in his confused state. Billy's case is reviewed by a higher court and he is re-convicted, this time for smuggling and receives a 30 year sentence.And now to the unlikely ending. Even though this story is supposedly a true story, I find the events of the ending a little hard to believe. Somehow he comes out of his confused state and is able to overpower the burly Hamidou and find a guard uniform from God knows where, and walk out the front door undetected. To me it spoils an otherwise great film.Davis is good as Billy Hayes who goes from a carefree tourist to an embittered prisoner.

Although the events took place in the 1970ies, I presume that conditions in Turkish prisons have not generally improved. And nowadays prisons in Europe are, in fact, guarded holiday homes, where inmates tend to enjoy better life than their law-abiding, but poorer countrymen...Directing and script are excellent, but the main character Billy Hayes (played by Brad Davies) is overshadowed by his countrymen Max and Jimmy (played by John Hurt and Randy Quaid, resp.). It is also pity that Turks were played by non-Turks and that only the first steps of escape were shown.

35,FilmCriticLalitRao,An Alan Parker film : One of the most controversial films about life in a prison,6,1 August 2008,"It is generally believed that ""Midnight Express"" is one of those rare films which must have had a long life of maximum television reruns in USA thanks to its disputatious content.Those who have seen it will have no qualms in affirming that even after 30 years of its release, Midnight Express continues to offend Turkish people as it had portrayed their nation as a barbaric third world country which has scant respect for human rights.All the fuss is created due to the shocking yet sympathetic portrayal of an American citizen William Hayes who is put in a Turkish prison after his arrest on drug peddling charges.It is true that director Alan Parker and script writer Oliver Stone have done a good job by showing that some prisons can turn out to be absolute hell.What did not work in their favor is the fact that most of scenes related to prison life and William Haye's treatment by Turkish authorities have been grossly exaggerated. To state that British director Alan Parker's film Midnight Express is a highly controversial work of art would be akin to twisting history.It is a film entirely based on perceptions.One must watch ""Le Trou"" by Jacques Becker if somebody is looking for a commendable film based on prison life.",Midnight Express
36,JasparLamarCrabb,Hard to take,7,6 October 2008,"It's a great movie but it's also VERY depressing...perhaps too depressing to recommend. Whether or not it's a ""true"" story doesn't really matter...director Alan Parker and screenwriter Oliver Stone have created a real work of art. Expertly cast Brad Davis is Billy Hayes, an American doing hard time in Turkish prison. Davis has just the right mix of hardness and vulnerability. The supporting cast is superb: Randy Quaid, Paul Smith (as the sadistic, nearly silent warden), and, best of all, John Hurt as a cat loving hash head. It's brutal, ugly and scary. The excellent music is by Vangelis. With Bo Hopkins, Irene Miracle as Davis's unlucky girlfriend and Mike Kellin as his father.",Midnight Express
37,jimbo-53-186511,"Strong in many areas, but it's Brad Davis' excellent performance that really sticks in your mind",7,26 October 2014,"Midnight Express follows the true story of college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who ends up imprisoned in a brutal Turkish prison after he attempts to smuggle drugs out of the country.Midnight Express was good on many levels, but I'll begin with Brad Davis; his acting performance in this film was superb - from the beginning when he's just an everyday cocky college punk, to him having to toughen up and adapt to the brutal way he's treated in prison, to then seeing him deteriorate and become more and more disillusioned was tough to watch, but also very realistic. Davis handled his character well and managed to be convincing across all the various stages of the narrative. There is a scene later in the film involving his girlfriend which was so touching and harrowing and further demonstrated Hayes' desperation. That scene really touched a nerve with me.Davis is well supported by the likes of Quaid and Hurt (although Hurt was particularly good in his respective role). Their characters become friends with Hayes and once Hayes is introduced to their characters the meaning of the title 'Midnight Express' soon becomes obvious.Those of a nervous disposition should be careful when watching this film as there are some scenes in this film that are quite tough to watch. In fairness though, the brutality isn't over the top and some of these scenes are shown off camera. I think that the writers did enough to show the brutality of the prison without being excessive or seemingly revelling in the violence. The balance was just about right.Despite the fact that Hayes was a criminal, I still found that I could identify with him and actually found him to be a fairly likable individual. There's no condoning what he did, but I just saw him as a naïve young man who was just out to try and make a quick buck back in the States. He stated that he was only going to sell the hash to his friends so it's not like he was a major drug kingpin. I was worried that I wouldn't care for his character because he was a criminal, but I did care and I could see that he wasn't a bad person deep down.All in all, Midnight Express is a wonderful film that is harrowing, moving, brutal and there are also some wonderful acting performances (notably from Hurt and Davis). Definitely worth a look.",Midnight Express

39,gcd70,Lasting Impression,8,20 June 2007,"One word completely describes this film. Powerful! The movie itself tells the painful and disturbing story of young American Billy Hayes who, in 1970, was convicted of being in possession of one kilogram of Hashish while attempting to leave Turkey. Billy is made an example for others by the Turkish High Court, and is subsequently sentenced unjustly to thirty years in a hellish Turk prison.Alan Parker's shocking film, based on a true story, uses powerful drama and extremely effective imagery to both hold you in and consistently hit you hard.

40,MarieGabrielle,"Dated, but still ....",8,27 July 2007,"This is a relevant story. I also read the book. Yes there are some stereotypes and some truly haunting scenes in the prison. The effects are there. The starkness and horrific conditions of the prison are visually indelible.Sympathy for the character? Well, you may have more if you read the book. Mike Kellin portrays Hayes' father, a world weary insurance salesman from NY who will do whatever he can to get his son out. The problem is that international law has no application here. Hayes has committed a crime of drug smuggling in Turkey, it will take more than an American attorney or even the embassy to protect Billy Hayes.Brad Davis is very good as Billy, John Hurt a the resident drug addict (rather annoying and hard to understand, mumbling alternate lines). Randy Quaid also as another imprisoned American. Overall it is an interesting, if depressing story and cautionary tale. One which people should take heed of, before traveling. When you are in a foreign country, you follow their laws, as being a tourist will not protect you. Recommended if you are up for this type of story. 8/10.",Midnight Express

In these times of political correctness, the main concern of some reviewers was to protest because the Turkish people were depicted in a bad light.I have been to Turkey (but not to prison) and it does not seem all that unlikely to me that bad living conditions and sadistic law enforcement both happens to coexist inside a prison - not only in Turkey but pretty much around the word.Given or taken some degrees of realism, the film is a tough ride that stood pretty well the test of time.",Midnight Express
42,raulfaust,I just wanna leave... or live,7,6 March 2014,"Whilst reading the reviews of 1999's ""Brokedown Palace"", I noticed many people stating how that picture was a copy of the ""classic Midnight Express""-- albeit I've never heard about it before. My local videostore just bought it on blu-ray and I rented it to check what's going on. ""Midnight Express"" tells a story about an American drug smuggler that gets caught while arriving on Turkey, and after that, things only go worse. There are some strong scenes that prove how professional are the director and Brad Davis, such as Billy's hearing on court. Also, the scene in which he turns everything upside down and beats Rifki up proves, clearly, how far people can go in a despairing situation. The cast, made mainly of local actors, helps bringing reality into the flick, since everyone seemed to be truly Turkish. The homosexual scene, however, didn't feel very elaborated to me; they are just normal friends, and all of a sudden, they end up kissing in the shower. Maybe that lack of explanation was due to the fact that sexual diversity was a HUGE taboo in the seventies, so I won't be that critical about it. For some moments, I considered it to have the plausible plot that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" wasn't able to, and it feels unfair that such movie is on top of IMDb's list, when this one is barely known world widely. Besides, I can agree that the story feels pretty original for the time it's been released, but nowadays it seems to exist lot of films like this out there. The ending is relatively happy, and it makes you remember that there always has to be HOPE in your heart! No matter how bad a situation can be, people and life itself will help you get out of it, so if this movie has a message, that should be it. It's not a hidden gem, but an interesting work from the seventies.",Midnight Express
43,eric262003,Gripping Story But Way Too Offenisive,8,25 March 2013,"""Midnight Express"" tells the true story of a young American tourist named Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who is visiting Turkey. While there, he steps over the line of himself by smuggling huge cartels of hashish out of the country. Without hesitation by the Turkish officials, Billy is sentenced to four years in prison.At first glance I had absolutely no sympathy for Billy as I felt the Turkish government was more than fair in Billy's sentencing. But as the movie progressed I started to take pity for Billy when the Turkish officials decided to expand his sentence to thirty years instead. The worst part is that they changed their minds after Billy was near to being discharged.At that moment I really thought hard and felt that though Billy committed a crime and should face some jail time, but I didn't think it was that bad that he should be jailed for thirty years.Sadly, Billy is very vulnerable. Even people who are fighting to get him out of prison like his father (Mike Kellin) and his Turkish lawyer had made the effort, but couldn't convince the Turkish authorities to get Billy out. So while on the topic of Turkish prison life, ""Midnight Express"" exhibits what goes on behind the walls in it's most graphic depictions you will ever see in your lifetime. The raping, the beatings prisoners endure and the #$%$ food are just some of the nasty routines that prisoners in Turkey face everyday of their lives. While in jail, Billy makes friends with some inmates like a frantic American named Jimmy, a gay Swede named Erich (Norbert Weisser) and a perpetually doped up Englishman named Max (John Hurt). The trio is seen together quite frequently, but violence rages on when Billy with the instincts like a wolf, actually annihilates another prisoner and literally rips the flash off the man's face.A lot of scenes are quite offencive and definitely not for the faint of heart. In one such case is when Billy's girlfriend (Irene Miracle) comes to pay him a visit. Though they were glassed apart from each other, Billy asks her to do remove her shirt so that he can bate the bishop. Nudity comes sporadically in the scene but it's only from the woman. The prison scenes feature more exposed nudity. The fighting displayed in the movie are quite graphic and at times over-the-top barbaric in its content. As you would expect in prisoner stories the language and profanity is often times gratuitous. In a rather disturbing scene that might not be for everyone involves Billy and Erich as they're in the shower together and they engage in the kiss, but you could clearly see that Erich wants to go beyond just a friendly kiss. Billy rebuffs the idea of taking it beyond. I for one don't have a problem with homosexuality, but for those who do might be disturbed by that scene.There are a lot of good thing about ""Midnight Express"" that make this movie special. The script was brilliantly written by Oliver Stone who won an Oscar for his achievement, and the movie was very impressive at the box office, but still I feel doubtful that this movie should be recommended. If you have never seen the movie and are curious about it don't let me stop anyone. I just felt very uncomfortable the whole time sitting through and was taken back at how cruel humanity can really be especially to those who go punished. Just be advised to those who would like to see ""Midnight Express"", there are images that are graphic to the max.",Midnight Express
44,philip_vanderveken,Much better than the average movie in the genre.,8,4 September 2005,"When it comes to movies about Americans who have been caught in some remote country and ended up in a filthy jail after they tried to smuggle drugs, I'm always very cautious. The main reason for that is because too often this kind of (TV-)movies tries too hard to show what a good guy the smuggler actually is and how bad and corrupt the people and the justice system in that particular country are, that a great injustice has been done to that poor man/woman, that this person didn't know that he/she was smuggling drugs because some bad guy switched bags without telling,... I'm very sorry, but I don't like that kind of drama's. It's not believable and it's my opinion that when you do the crime, you'll have to sit the time. However, I'm also convinced that not all movies in the genre are as bad as that and this ""Midnight Express"" may well be the best example to prove it.When the young American tourist Billy Hayes is about to return home from his holiday in Turkey with his girlfriend, he's caught smuggling drugs out of the country. The prosecutor wants to make an example of him and asks a life sentence, but thanks to some bribes and a lawyer who knows his way in the court rooms, he gets a much smaller sentence. However, the prosecutor isn't all too happy with that and goes into higher appeal. Because the government wants to set an example, they decide to change the previous four years of jail time - which he already has served except for 53 days - in at least thirty. Hayes isn't able to cope with that extra setback and starts to decent into complete insanity, also partially caused by the severe treatment given to him and his 'friends' by the jailers. Because he can no longer count on any opportunities for a swift release, he sees no other but to take 'the Midnight Express', which is jail-slang for escaping...If you are looking for some nice images about Turkey or want to learn something about its culture, its people,... than this isn't the movie that you are looking for. This certainly isn't a nice documentary about the country, but should be seen as some kind of warning to all people that think about smuggling drugs out of the (often Asian and / or Muslim) countries where they spent their holidays. If I read some other comments, than I get the feeling that this isn't alway very clear to some people. They believe that this movie doesn't show the real Turkey, that the country has a lot more to offer than what we see in this film. I couldn't agree more with that statement, but this is still a prison movie, showing prison life, not the daily lives of the ordinary Turks. This movie shows how drug smugglers were treated in Turkey in the 1970's and it has to be said that it does a good job. It has become a surprisingly powerful movie that isn't too corny or too black-and-white. Sure, it shows that life in a Turkish jail wasn't a pleasure (and for as far as we hear over here, still isn't - one of the reasons why they aren't allowed to the European Union is because they don't care all that much about human rights), but it also shows that Hayes wasn't just a victim. If he hadn't taped those drugs on his body, he would have been able to get out of the country as a free man. He chose to take the risk and he lost.Next to the interesting story, this movie is also worth watching for the very nice performances by Brad Davis, Paolo Bonacelli, John Hurt, Franco Diogene, Norbert Weisser,... They all did a very good job, lifting this movie even more above the average in the genre. Take for instance Franco Diogene. He's really excellent as the corrupt lawyer who can arrange something for a little price. The man does not only act like a real one, he also looks like such a lawyer. Really very nice.All in all this is an excellent movie for all those people who don't mind to see a not so nice view on Turkey and who are looking for something extra in the average court room / drug smuggling drama. I didn't expect it before watching this movie, but I really liked it. That's why I give this movie a rating of 7.5/10.",Midnight Express
45,sme_no_densetsu,Quality seventies cinema,8,27 March 2011,"Alan Parker's ""Midnight Express"" tells the story of Billy Hayes, a young American imprisoned in Turkey for a drug-smuggling offence. Conditions in the prison are deplorable and the machinery of justice is slow to move in his favour. Considering this state of affairs, Hayes begins to eye escape as his only chance for freedom.The film is based on a true story but Parker freely acknowledges that several adjustments were made in the process of adaptation. Not being familiar with the actual events, I found the proceedings to be realistic in spirit and not having the feel of Hollywood fakery.That being said, Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning screenplay does venture into hyperbole from time to time. Luckily, the few missteps are made up for by as many (if not more) memorable scenes. Also, while the script is often bashed for showing a one-sided view of the Turks, I think that any level-headed individual will recognize that this film is not meant as an indictment of the Turkish people in general.When it comes to the acting, the standout is John Hurt, who collected his first Oscar nomination for his supporting performance. Surprisingly, leading man Brad Davis was passed over for his performance, though he did snag Golden Globe & BAFTA nominations. As for the rest of the cast, Randy Quaid is a bit of a weak link but the majority of the cast is dependable.Alan Parker's Oscar-nominated direction is impressive but the film's distinctive look may owe as much to Michael Seresin's attractive cinematography. Meanwhile, Giorgio Moroder's electronic score ended up winning an Oscar but timeless it is not.In the end, ""Midnight Express"" delivers a satisfying viewing experience despite not completely finding its groove until roughly the halfway point. After 30+ years it holds up well, with little besides the Moroder score to betray its age.",Midnight Express
46,schappe1,It's not about Turkey,8,2 October 2019,"I found an old VHS tape of this film among my film collection: I don't think I've watched it for 30 years so I put it in the machine. I thought it was a strong movie with good performances and held up very well. I've always liked the music. I was amazed to read the reviews and find that the film was treated like a cinematic diatribe against Turkey and the Turkish people. The film is not about Turkey. That's simply the setting. it's no more about the Turkish people than ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is about the American people.The film works on two levels. It's about a guy who foolishly decides to ignore the laws of a foreign country and smuggle hashish from ti to make some quick money. He gets caught and confronts a series of policemen, lawyers, judges and prison guards, none of them sympathetic characters. Those are the ""Turkish people"" presented to him and to us. They are little different from the sort of people who would hold those jobs in any country, including ours. A couple of prisoners make comments about disliking Turks but that's because this is their experience of them. There's no implications that all of the Turkish people are like these characters. On this level the film is just a stark reminder that if you travel to a foreign country you must be aware of and obey their laws. Just because you are an American, you have no special status.The other level of the film and the part that makes it special is the psychological. the ""Midnight Express"" is not a train but it's not just an escape attempt. When Billy winds up in the asylum, he gets into a battle to hold on to his mind. He doesn't want to be a ""bad machine"", which is the other way to escape his dismal reality. he's losing that battle when his girlfriend show up to give him hope and reason to use it. That's what the movie is really about.",Midnight Express

I read the book which is different than the movie and a enjoyable read recommended. The movie keeps one tuned in and for you druggies out there, the lure of drug-free laws or usage was strong back then and people wanted to stay high or include it in everything they did which in this case it became part of a vacation. The thinking was: while I'm here, I will pick up (score) for next to nothing quantity of this stuff and party-hearty when I get home etc. Getting caught in this country was bad enough but out of the USA? A nightmare! It will do everyone well to leave this country and contrast it personally for yourself and then come back renewed and thankful.

I do agree with character development and all that, but I feel what needed to be said to make the movie work could have been said in 30 minutes instead of the used 60 minutes. The only other thing that bothered me about this film was Irene Miracle (Susan). I mean that woman couldn't act if her life depended on it. What a BAD performance, really. Who chose that chick? She was awful in my opinion and in her last scene (not the photo's at the end) she nearly ruined everything. It was a MIRACLE that she got the part and yet another that she received a Golden Globe nomination, though I must admit it was a miracle Brad Davis didn't get an Oscar nomination as well. The film itself is not too special and there are some real Hollywood moments in there, along with the crappy Miracle and the slow first hour, but I HAVE TO SAY I enjoyed Brad Davis' acting a lot.6 out of 10",Midnight Express
50,gab-14712,Don't Get Arrested In Turkey!,9,18 October 2017,"Alan Parker's Midnight Express is a powerful movie based on the real-life experiences of Billy Hayes and his brutal stay at a Turkish prison in the early 1970's. This film paints a portrait on how awful life in prison can be especially as a foreigner. It doesn't help that the Turkish guards are nasty brutes reveling in the fact that they can do whatever they want to their prisoners. Especially the head guard. Wow, what a sadistic man! I'll tell you straight up that this film can be hard to watch sometimes because of the brutality of the prison scenes. They are very violent and the head guard's favorite punishment is painfully beating the soles of the feet. This film is also a portrait on the corruption of the Turkish political and criminal system (Hayes was sentenced to over 30 years for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country just to set an example). This film is also a wonderful portrait on the descent from normality to madness. Hayes is seen at first as a man fighting to be free, but we later see him as a shadow of himself, high on opium, with little chance of seeing the outside world again. There are many issues at play regarding themes, and Alan Parker does a magnificent job making them relevant. This could have been a simple prison escape movie, but this film was more than that by tackling very important themes relevant to the time period.One thing that interested me is how the Turks are portrayed in the movie. It did not bother me as it bothered many others, but all Turkish people are viewed as corrupt. Whether they are the prison guards, lawyers, judges, prisoners, or just citizens-all of them are viewed as bad people. In reality, many Turks are great people. Maybe it was the time period of the film's release, but it was clear that Parker and screenwriter Oliver Stone were either judgmental or ignorant. It's a sad fact that I did not notice until a while after the viewing of this film but regardless, my viewpoints of the film do not change.Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is an American college student in Turkey on vacation. But on October 6th, 1970, he is arrested for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. He is originally given a light sentence, but the Turkish courts changed the sentence to over thirty years to make an example out of him. The prison environment is awful thanks to the sadistic torture from head guard Hamidou (Paul L. Smith.) For Hayes, there are only two options for release. He can wait for help from his family and friends back home and the American government or he can take the ""Midnight Express"" which stands for escaping the prison.The performances are brilliant to say the least. The acting is the main reason why the film is so powerful. Brad Davis does very well as Billy Hayes. His performance gave me the chills because it showed what it was like to be dehumanized. He did end up saying some very powerful courtroom speeches before he got sent away to prison. Paul L. Smith absolutely crushes it as Hamidou. He is a brutal man, and Smith does a good job convincing us so. There are two other performances worthy of a mention. John Hurt as a British prisoner named Max who is the drug supplier and Randy Quaid as the free-spirited American prisoner named Jimmy Booth bent on escape. Hurt's supporting turn stuck with me most of all. There is a disturbing scene where his cat is hung and killed by one of the Turkish prisoners and Hurt's pain made his performance resounding and realistic. In fact, he was nominated for an Oscar because his performance was so good.Controversies aside, Oliver Stone's script and Alan Parker's direction stood out to me. Stone would eventually become a great director himself, but he really developed himself as a screenwriter. Stone always had a passion for politics, so it's no surprise he would tackle the subject of global justice corruption. He really captured the essence of prison life from the view of an outsider (in which Hayes was). Stone also sympathizes with Hayes. Hayes is known to be not too nice of a guy, but it did not really seem like it here. Alan Parker has a keen eye for politics as well. Not just this movie, but you'll see in future movies. Parker's style is to get you hooked right away, and boy did he do that here. The opening scene has Davis walking through the Turkish airport with his girlfriendand drugs taped to his body. The sweat dripping down his face, the intimidating guards, what a way to open the movie! I really, really liked Midnight Express. Nominated for six Oscars and winning two of them (for Stone's screenplay and the wonderful score by Giorgio Moroder), Hollywood also really liked the movie. It did not come without its controversies, but this film really ended up being a tense watch from beginning to end. SPOILERS!!! For those who know the story, Hayes did manage to escape prison. But it was a pain-staking process for him. Life in Turkish prison is harsh and the film is very successful is showing that thanks to the brutal torture techniques from Hamidou. This story is about morality, violence, and sadism..and yes you may be terrified.My Grade: A",Midnight Express
51,Ruskington,Another Alan Parker masterpiece,8,4 August 2020,"Thanks in no small part to Alan Parker's unique hallmarks, Midnight Express ranks as one of the most compelling prison dramas of the 20th century. Although he is prone to overdoing things at times, Brad Davis is nevertheless entirely captivating in the lead role and his performance is extremely poignant given the events of his real life. John Hurt is equally brilliant, delivering a breakthrough performance of astounding quality. Many aspects of the film are somewhat dated but the seventies feel that pervades every scene is perfectly appropriate for a piece like this.Many of the criticisms of the movie are aimed at its portrayal of Turkish people in a solely negative light. I would have to disagree. The Turkish police and prison guards are shown to be inhumane and sadistic but this is true of virtually any prison movie, wherever it may be set. There is no need to conflate trope characterisation with racist stereotyping. The Turkish prisoners meanwhile, appear to be more placid, less grotesque and much less barbaric than the usual band of rapists and gangsters that are depicted in American prison movies on a constant basis.This is one of those movies that is thoroughly unpleasant to watch but lingers in the heart and mind long after. Watching it is a deeply visceral and disturbing experience, particularly in its final act where we are introduced to an almost literal hell.Strangely, I watched this film for the first time on the same day that Alan Parker passed away- July 31st 2020. It seems appropriate to mention that I rate him as one of the great film-makers, a true master of his craft, and Midnight Express only consolidates that opinion.",Midnight Express

Sane ones do, but commit these acts to defy law or are in a business prohibited by the law(prostitution,gambling,extortion,car-jacking,drug-peddling etc.). This film is based on the true story of Billy Hayes, a young American student sent to a Turkish prison for trying to smuggle hashish out of Turkey.There because of America's relationship with Turkey at that time, Billy's sentence changes from 4 years to 30 years.Billy has no option but to escape any way he can.This 1978 film won two Oscars Best Music, Original Score (Giorgio Moroder) and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Oliver Stone).The casting is superb.

Norbert Weisser plays a gay Swede who was also convicted for smuggling hashish.Bo Hopkins has the smallest role of all but plays his part with finesse. Well?

It seemed to show the world the way it really was. It exposed in exquisite detail a corrupt third-world justice system and a brutal prison system.And I just saw it again today, about 35 years later. Some of the scenes, so devastating back them, have become memes in modern culture (""Oh Billy...""), so it's hard to appreciate them fully now. It's also difficult to sit through such an unrelentingly negative portrayal of Turkey. I've been to Turkey several times, and it is difficult to see this side of Turkey. It didn't help that the producer and writer played up that aspect.Regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy, it is one hell of a good movie.",Midnight Express
56,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: Midnight Express (1978),8,28 August 2005,"Synopsis: Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is your average American kid in the 70's. Sex, drugs and rock n' roll are his lifestyle but his whole world comes crashing down when he is busted at the Turkish airport attempting to smuggle drugs out of the country. But his youthful indiscretion turns into a living hell as he becomes a game piece between two governments as he is forced to rot in the bowels of a Turkish prison. 'Midnight Express' is based on a true story. (Also stars: Irene Miracle, Bo Hopkins, Paul L. Smith, Randy Quaid and John Hurt)Thoughts: It's been said that the fact based 'Midnight Express' was an over-exaggerated account of the real events. But that doesn't stop the film from being in any way less powerful. This early Oliver Stone script (based off the book co-authored by the real Billy Hayes) lays out a powerful, social-political drama that nabbed Stone an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The fine musical score by Giorgio Moroder also won an Oscar (it also received nominations for Picture, Director, Film Editing and a Supporting Actor nod for John Hurt). The cast wonderfully do their parts with Brad Davis' first major role and John Hurt's role as one of Billy's prison friends. Alan Parker (Fame, Pink Floyd The Wall) shows us his knack of gritty film-making that he would use so effectively in the supernatural thriller 'Angel Heart'. ""Midnight Express' is an excellent and superbly acted and written social drama. S10 rates it an 8 out of 10.",Midnight Express
57,thejcowboy22,Shurla Burla! Praise the Quaid! Read the book it's much better.,4,17 October 2018,"I remember my first independent business enterprise. It was 1971. My stocky friend Jeff and yours truly started a label-making business. We sold at least 5 to 6 label makers a week to our fellow classmates at $3.00 apiece. It was going really well as we continued to sell these popular little labelers through Elmont Junior high. We sold the unit plus multi-colored refill rolls at a modest pace as sales grew throughout the hallowed hallways. Oh, I forgot to mention our supplier. Jeff and I would enter our local supermarket and shoplift the items which were situated at the rear of the store. I would stay at the front near the register and watch the manager in his booth as Jeff would snatch the items and shove them in his coat and then walk ever so briskly away and out the door to safety. We would alternate the theft as I would steal the items in my coat and Jeff would be the lookout at the exit. This went on for months until one day the manager with the help of his employees were ready for us as I noticed the manager wasn't at his regular perch in the booth but I figured he was away somewhere. Jeff took the items and put them in his coat with the confidence that no one was around. Then all of a sudden Jeff was surrounded by the manager and several male employees. They took the label guns and smacked him with the stolen item. Jeff didn't even cry. He was so surprised he had no time to react. I froze in my tracks and then when I turned toward the exit doors two guys grabbed me and said, "" where are you going?"" The staff took us down the stairs for an interrogation The room had cement walls and a musty smell. Quite the opposite from the upstairs with the light and airy atmosphere. Jeff and I were in a world of trouble. This brings me to my review of Midnight Express. I read the book about the overseas incarceration of Long Island-born and raised Billy Hayes. Billy strapped two bricks of Turkish hash to his chest as he boards a plane for home. Unfourtnetly without Billy knowing, a bomb threat was happening at the Istanbul Airport. Each passenger was frisked including the bulk-ridden Billy. Billy was pulled from the plane as the Turkish authorities ransacked his suitcase looking for more hashish. Billy is questioned by a liaison of the Turkish police named Tex (Bo Hopkins). Tex wants Billy to finger his supplier by going to the pudding shop where he claims he purchased the marijuana. Instead, Billy flees only to get caught and thrown into prison. Billy (Brad Davis) ends up in an abominable, dirty, disgusting prison. Filled with an international array of convicts who do drugs, steal from each other, and randomly stab each other. This is a progressive prison so every so often the head guard constantly scowling (Paul Smith) would beat an inmate with a club in an open square with his two children present just to keep everyone in line. Meanwhile Billy is hopeful that his sentence will be lessened or downgraded. His father (Mike Kellin) travels to Turkey and pays an appeasing yellow-bellied Turkish lawyer (Franco Diogene) his entire savings to get him out. Director Alan Parker shows the hopelessness and drudgery of prison life with some of the ugliest prisoners you would ever see. Billy forms a small circle of friends in prison starting with the gentle Swede Erich (Norbert Weiss) as the movie shifts and becomes more tolerable. The hook in this film is the energetic acting performance of Randy Quaid who plays Jimmy. Both Jimmy and Billy spend there days trying to figure how to dig there way out of the prison. Meanwhile drug addict Max played by John Hurt, (with the company of his felines), creates comic relief as Jimmy and Max argue throughout the film. The antagonist, also notable in the film, Rivki (Paolo Bonacelli) who does bad business dealings with his cellmates, promotes hate of Americans and chaos in the snake pit of prison. In hindsight this film was an anti-Turkish film written by Oliver Stone who to my chagrin did an editing hack job on Billy Hayes's book which hampers the ending of the movie. The Music score is my Favorite. The""Chase"" has a catchy beat to this day and goes well with jogging or roller blades. Some facts about the film ... Giorgio Moroder won the Oscar for Best Music score and for the record, Billy Hayes smuggled hashish from Turkey to the U. S. about 4 times before he got caught. Jeff and I went to the well too many times and also got busted. Meanwhile Jeff and I were stuck in the basement as the store manager tried to call our parents. Luckily my mother was out shopping in another store. Jeff's Mom was running late from her job. The manager let us go and banned us from the store permanently. A few years later the store went out of business. A shoplifting experience!",Midnight Express
58,rocknrelics,Entertaining enough.,6,18 September 2021,"Whilst I'm sure this probably seemed quite violent when released, it seems very tame by today's standards, and therefore any shock value is reduced.Having said that, there's decent performances from all involved, and it moves along at a decent pace, and therefore entertains with no problem.Would I call it a classic of cinema? No I wouldn't, the storyline is very basic, and whilst apparently based on a true story , it seems reality has been stretched to its limits for the film.Worth a watch, but once you've seen it, you've seen it, there aren't layers there to keep going back to.",Midnight Express
59,mcfly-31,not for the tourism board...,5,8 August 2010,"The film that launched a thousand ""turkish prison"" jokes into the 1980s, this sees young American smuggler Davis tossed into a cruel foreign jail. Attempting to bring a bunch of dope stateside, he's busted at the airport, which begins a hellish five year ordeal.Being a big ""pacing"" hound, I usually enjoy films that quickly get into their plots. But somehow, here, it hurt the film for the most part. We know nothing about Davis, and when he's subjected to vicious conditions in the prison, there isn't a lot of sympathy. If he, perhaps, was a smuggler driven by some sort of debt that his life depended on, then I may have felt more. But at the heart of things, he is a criminal, and has only himself to blame for any time he must serve.Davis carries the film well enough, but it was the people that surrounded him, that added more character. Quaid's rambling crusader, and the perpetually stoned-out Hurt, make for more interesting personality studies. All the business involving Davis' father and lawyer and courts, etc, just had an absent tone to them. Throw in your obligatory band of ruthless prison guards, and everything is sort of unoriginally standard.Another glaring frustration is the lack of subtitles. At the front, it was mostly effective, as we feel what Davis' feels when hearing a bunch of incomprehensible jargon barked out in ominous tones. But once Davis learns the language (and can communicate with it rather effectively, as seen later), we needed to be privy to what was being discussed. Otherwise, it's just more blather.As far as the close goes, it was entirely too rushed and inadequate. After all that build (to a confrontation you knew would come), things sort of jump to a conclusion that isn't really finished. And the homecoming wrap-up involving black and white photos was a very peculiar choice. And I'm sure a vast majority will disagree with me, but Davis almost suffers too little. Sure, there's beatings and mental decomposition, but most of Davis stay is clouded by attempts at escape and legal boloney (punctuated by the embarrassingly rambled courtroom tirade).In all, the film can still shock with its more seedy sexual subject matter and third-world environment, but the sum total isn't equal to as good a film as it could have been.",Midnight Express
60,TheExpatriate700,"Good, but Not Great",7,22 July 2010,"Midnight Express is an involving thriller focusing on the plight of a young American drug smuggler imprisoned in Turkey. This controversial film has been accused of being anti-Turkish, while simultaneously serving as a potent warning to those who want to smuggle drugs across borders. The truth is, it is a mixture of the two.The most involving character in the film is the prison itself, which as a society seems to form a living organism in its own right. Isolated from the rest of the world, the prison develops its own economy and mores, in essence becoming a type of microcosm. Indeed, at times I found myself wishing the filmmakers would go into more detail on the functioning of this captive community.Although there is a great deal of brutality in the film, at times the Turkish prison comes across as more humane than its Western counterparts. Inmates are allowed to keep their own clothes, and do not appear to be put to hard labor. This does not excuse the brutality depicted, but does provide a counterpoint to accusations that the movie is uniformly anti-Turkish.Furthermore, contrary to statements by some reviewers, there are actually some sympathetic Turkish characters in the film. For instance, it is made clear that the judge only sentences Hayes to a long term because of the inflexibility of Turkish law. The accusations seem to stem from the fact that many of the villainous characters, such as the guard Hamid, are underdeveloped. We do not see their motivations for cruelty, so that they seem to be caricatures.One flaw of the film, a symptom of the time it was made, is its squeamish treatment of homosexuality within the prison. Although it is clear that prisoners resort to homosexuality, the film refuses to go into any detail, other than a rather clichéd implied romance between Hayes and another prisoner. Ultimately though, the film's main flaw, aside from those mentioned above, is the rather histrionic script from Oliver Stone. The bombast overwhelms the film at times. Nevertheless, it is still worth a view.",Midnight Express
61,cat_ranchero,Interesting...,8,9 September 2012,"Very well made with some great visuals on show; you really get a feel for the place. I can't say I was enamoured with the music though, yes there were a few Turkish themes but then there was this electronic music that seemed to cut right across the grain. How the music won the Oscar in 1979 I will never know! All the performances were very good; Brad Davis does a decent job in the lead roll as Billy Hayes without being particularly outstanding. Randy Quaid did some great scenery chewing as Jimmy Booth, John Hurt was excellent (as ever) and Max and Norbert Weisser did a decent job as Erich. Of the bad guys, I thought Paolo Bonacelli did a very good job as the slippery Rifki and Paul L. Smith did a great job as the brutal head guard Hamidou. Finally honourable mentions go to both Irene Miracle as Billy's girlfriend, Susan and Mike Kellin as Billy's father.For a film that won two Oscars; 'Best Music, Original Score' and 'Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium'; I found it a little disappointing. Other nominations included 'Best Actor in a Supporting Role' for John Hurt which I thought was well deserved. I think what lets it down is the performance of Brad Davis in the central role. He doesn't quite carry it off and, because the whole film hangs on his part, it suffers because of it. It's almost like he's trying just a little bit too hard at times and you can see it on the screen. Even so, it's an intriguing tale with some nice touches; for example the use of the sound of Billy's heartbeat as he's going through customs as the beginning of the film; very effective. Over all, well worth a look but not particularly for the central role; there is still much to admire though, hence my score.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.8/10",Midnight Express

63,happipuppi13,"My Expression For ""Midnight Express""",10,15 March 2007,"I'll start off by saying that I hold no prejudiced views of Turks or any other culture in this world and I know that not all Turks are of a violent nature. We shouldn't take what Hayes said at the time and the things shown here as gospel.By the same token though,I also don't defend Hayes or anyone else who deals in illegal activities. Hayes himself,in the the short film extra that accompanies the movie/DVD,looked back at his ordeal at age 30 and stated his regret. He's 56/57 now and this is all water under the bridge.The truths told here are that prison systems in other countries and Turkey at that time in history were archaic,ruthless and unforgiving. Not to mention crooked and corrupt. That said,I finally saw this movie for the first time last night. I recall the ads back in 1978 but of course,I was too young too see such a thing. Spotting a copy at the local library I decided to finally watch it. Since the storyline has been told here before I'll simply state that in terms of telling a true to life story,this movie at times excels and at other times seems just slightly over the top,but most Hollywood movies take creative license that way anyway. Hard as the violent scenes are to watch,it would not have done justice to the film to sanitize these realities. I'm just glad they didn't actually show the children getting their feet struck with a heavy board,that would have been too much. Hayes hatred of the Turks that he states in the courtroom is not something he came into the country with,he was justifiably angry and at his wits end with their supposed system of justice. While it's wrong to break the law there should always be a limit and a measure of what is the suitable price one should pay for their actions.Davis was a fine actor and his performance is spectacular. Had I seen this before Jim Carrey was famous,I would have not laughed unintentionally every time he said ""Max"". Davis & Carrey look somewhat similar and though I haven't seen what Carrey did in ""The Cable Guy"",I know it had to be a great send-up. Davis is absolutely electric when his character goes on a rampage and ends up in the insane asylum.The actors playing the Turks who run the prison don't budge an inch from their roles as virtual monsters who revel in the violence and cruelty they are allowed to get away with. Randy Quaid gives one of the best performances I've ever seen him in and I really felt bad for his character who is sent into the ""sanatarium"" twice and beaten senseless. The Georgio Moroder score certainly punctuates every scene that it's used in.Again,putting aside political views and without any prejudices,I can honestly rate this movie 10 stars. I recommend it 100% but only for those with a strong skin and mind that can tolerate the violence depicted. Lastly,it's wise to remember that not ""all"" people of a given country or culture/group think and believe or do things in the same way. There are countries that control it's citizens' thoughts and actions but eventually time and the resolve of independent thinking wins out in the long run.Midnight Express though based on fact,is still after all,only a movie.(END)",Midnight Express
64,jonathanruano,Midnight Express (1978) -- Review,10,24 October 2009,"""Midnight Express"" ranks as one of the most daring and original prison films ever made -- thanks mainly to the creative genius of Director Alan Pakula and screenwriter (and future director) Oliver Stone. If you could imagine a movie about Donald Trump getting busted for hashish possession in Turkey, denouncing Turkey as a ""nation of pigs,"" and then emerging from his difficulties victorious, then that's basically the plot of Midnight Express.To be sure, this movie is based upon a true story. The main character Billy Hayes (played brilliantly in the movie by Brad Davis) was arrested and imprisoned for hashish possession in Turkey. He did escape from prison, after his sentence was changed from 3-5 years to 30 years. Yet the most entertaining content of this film is an invention: What Pakula and Stone have done is make a film about a youthful and narcissistic Donald Trump-equivalent getting imprisoned for hashish possession. As with Donald Trump, Billy Hayes' outrage against Turkey's justice system (apparently for unjustly imprisoning him) and bigotry against all Turks are valid only to himself. After all, Billy Hayes knew about the draconian drug laws in Turkey. He is guilty of smuggling hashish out of Turkey, just as we can imagine Trump being guilty of breaking the law. Any objective person would, therefore, conclude that Hayes is primarily responsible for his misfortunes. But since this story is viewed solely from Hayes' perspective, these inconvenient truths are overlooked and his imprisonment is a straight forward case of injustice.Moreover, Hayes' outrage over his lengthy imprisonment interestingly enough does not translate into sympathy for the Turks who encountered a similar fate. Critic Roger Ebert considers Billy Hayes' self-pity to be the main weakness in the film, but maybe this weakness is a strength. ""Midnight Express"" is a fascinating film about a young narcissist who views the Turkish justice system only in terms of how it victimizes him. He does not have much sympathy for the Turkish prisoners who faced the same severe treatment as himself. He promises to help his fellow inmate Max (played by John Hurt) out of a hellhole of an insane asylum, but interestingly Max never gets mentioned again after Hayes is free. This omission is deliberate: for the movie Hayes, success is measured only in terms of his ability to break out of prison and denounce all Turks as pigs. Hayes is also similar to Trump in another way: he has an uncanny ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. While it's hard to imagine feeling much sympathy for Midnight Express' Hayes or Trump, that does not diminish the entertainment value of watching either personality maneuver themselves out of very difficult circumstances and outwit their adversaries.Moreover, Billy Hayes' narcissistic and self-centered crusade to freedom takes place amidst a feast of sadomasochistic, drug-induced, and sadistic nightmare set to composer Giorgio Moroder's disco synths. This daring and original approach to filmmaking can go terribly wrong. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini's last film, the 120 Days of Sodom, was a shocking disaster, because of its treatment of roughly the same subject matter. But Pakula and Stone make this material work, with the result that they create a whole new fantasy world for Billy Hayes to inhabit. This world is both terrible and fascinating to watch and is bolstered by some great supporting performances. Randy Quaid contributes to the film's more amusing scenes as the mischievous schemer Jimmy. Paul Smith delivers a deliciously evil performance as the Turkish captain Hamidou the bear, whose repressed homosexuality takes on truly perverse and brutal forms in the film's sadomasochistic scenes. John Hurt is brilliant as the doped up Max. Lastly, there is even Norbert Weisser as Hayes' gay lover in the movie's surreal romantic scene. A brilliant film.",Midnight Express
65,fimimix,..difficult to enjoy..,10,2 June 2006,"Although I was fascinated with this movie when it was released, it truly WAS difficult to watch - the only enjoyment one could get from it is the strong comment on how inhumane humans can beI've read every comment - I understand the Turks' anger over the exaggerations and criticisms, however I suppose there are awful prisons like this all over the world. The point that ALL overlooked is, being in ANY jail for ANY reason is not a holiday. Turkey, because of human-rights violations has been refused Eurpoean Union participation for years: see the comment made by ""Tillie Gokbydak"". It's not the only nation guilty of that. It took many years for USA prisoners to win freedom by use of DNA. Although they are set free, no guarantee their life can pick-up where it took-off, almost impossible.AND - we are now hearing of human-rights violations by American troops in Iraq. This only proves the point that you cannot take very young men and women, turn them into dummies to ""follow orders, no matter what"", teach them to be killers and not expect them to kill - whether they were disposed to this crime or committed it out of anger. Now, tell me that any nation which had ""colonies"" wasn't guilty of being a tad ruthless. Has no one else heard stories that Turkey and other Mid-Eastern nations can be fanned to anger from ancient crusades over Christianity, fanned by influence from The Vatican? ""Holy Roman Emperor"" wasn't an empty title - ""Rome"" wanted revenge because the crusaders seldom won. We must consider those Mid-Eastern nations are much older than other nations.......they arne't dumb.However, I must inform you of an annual event that takes place in Los Angeles. Blocks apart, Armenians are still protesting - in large groups - over their genocide, and the Turks are protesting that they are protesting....""it ain't true"". History will bear-out it is. The law-enforcement brigade for this protest is huge. But, nations today don't want to be shackled by their ancestors' foibles, and that is understandable. Think about African-Americans and slavery......I've never heard of a Turkish Mafia, but there is an Armenian one.....""Midnight Express"" is a shockingly beautiful movie. One doesn't have to look extremely hard to see its message. True, Hayes was a criminal - I agree with those who make that point. My question is how he thought he could get past customs in the USA ? Double-dumb, don't you think? The true story is just as many have discovered, being in such a degrading atmosphere for many years is enough to make anyone insane. I think Brad Davis' acting was brilliant - I knew him.....he was a very nice man with a lot of humility, trying to be successful in his career, cut-down by AIDS. That should tell you a story - he was bisexual. The prisoner who wanted to make love to him WAS his friend - they did exercises to keep sane, together. I don't think Davis would have objected had that scene progressed to sexuality. For those who commented on rape in prisons, it is seldom one-on-one: it involves a gang. We must be truthful and also admit that sexual repression will cause heterosexual prisoners - or soldiers - to ""use"" what is available.I also read the book, and agree that it wouldn't have made a very good movie, as written. We tend to forget that movies are seldom factual, as many commentators have written. Too dull - we wouldn't enjoy them....movies are an escape from realism, or can make very important statements. No one should be overly influenced by their plots - it's wonderful to become engrossed in a film, but it's going to end....no matter what impression you get, let it end.Commentator ""Egozalan"" from Turkey confirms Turkish prisoners were brutalized. It is fact that Turkey imprisoned 20,000 political victims. Every country is guilty of that. ""Midnight Express"" expresses how the frailty of the human body and emotions can stand only so much. Although it took half of the film for Hayes to come to that victimization, there is little doubt that Davis played the role with conviction. How we would like for humans to treat one another doesn't always happen - we are too naive.As for the other actors, I think they all were brilliant - Randy Quaid was the kook he was supposed to be, no matter what he stole (same guy in ""Brokeback Mountain""?). Paul Smith must have done some deep research to make his role so brutal. John Hurt delivers total devotion to any role he has done. Mike Kellan's father broke my heart for ""if I could be where you are""; all parents suffer and grieve for their children in such circumstances. ""Rifki"" was a monster. Whatever language those supposedly Turkish actors were speaking is of little importance, but their acting was just as brilliant as the featured players: they did their job by convincing us. More than any other reason, the film was made to make money - good-ole American capitalism.....if Hayes didn't realize his book would be cannibalized, then HE was naive. He took the money and ran, whether it came from Armenians or Hollywood........and we must admit there are films denigrating Americans. We have to accept that.....they are films. The Mid-East is centuries older than we are - it was the seat of civilization, so you may ponder those people were our ancestors, too.I gave this movie a 10, although it is near torture to watch. If you thought it was trash, watch it again - perhaps you'll discover things you missed the first time. Bravo for Davis !!!",Midnight Express
66,karl_consiglio,What's a nice guy like you doing in a place like this?,8,2 September 2006,"For Billy Hayes 1970 was a horrifying year it was the year when he tried to smuggle 4lbs of hashish from Istanbul back to his home in America. It was the year when he was arrested at Istanbul airport, tried, and sentenced to eventually thirty years in a Turkish prison. For five years he suffered the filth, brutality and degradation of imprisonment in an environment of hellish squalor, while his family fought in vain to secure his release. Finally in desperation he made a daring escape bid and incredibly the bid succeeds. This is the astounding true story of Billy Hayes in living hell and of the harrowing ordeal to get out of there. Vivid, realistic and at times morbid, a classic story of survival and human endurance, told with touch of humour, intelligence and total honesty. Most of this film was made in Malta when i would say we were practically off the map because they even used our own language pretending it was Turkish at times.

This is a milestone to all films that are going to depict human struggle in the environment where nothing human exists. I found this film more fascinating even than 'Shaw-shank Redemption' regarding many things. The latter even though made 20 years later is much more sweetened and it matches the seventies more than Midnight Express. On contrary, for the time made, Midnight Express is being served to the audience without any softeners never attempting to underestimate life in the place as Turkish Prison. Extremely direct and expressionistic this film is playing with your hope moving it up and down never underestimating a power of faith of one most likely lost individual.

I've met and known a lot of pretty girls in my life but none were prettier than Paula. She was just about to begin a job working as an usher in a local movie theater. The film playing that night was MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. Now I must tell you that the Maxter once did a six month bit in a North African prison. I was surprised to find out that Paula did two and a half years in Algeria. I went to visit her on her first night of work not knowing what the film would be. When we came to both the trial and especially the prison sequences we both couldn't stop laughing. It was more like summer camp than a North African prison and we knew what some dank pestilent hole in Turkey would be like. I'm afraid my roaring - ""Oh Billy"" while he wanks off in the prison visiting room - set her off so much that she was fired. Oliver Stone won an academy award for the script which is a different sort of laugh maker, and hey, Alan Parker was one of my favorite directors but its just so much crap, like a piece of crap under twelve coats of automotive enamel with chrome do-dads.

73,ScottAmundsen,Exciting and Involving But Unfortunately Also Somewhat Dishonest,7,26 June 2012,"There's a lot to like about MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. Based on a true story, it stars Brad Davis as Billy Hayes, a young American arrested and imprisoned in Istanbul, Turkey, for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country. The harshness of the prison conditions displayed in Parker's film are a bit over the top, but the one thing you can't call this film is boring. And I never understood why it didn't make a major star of the late Brad Davis.Davis is miscast; dark and stocky, he looks nothing like the real Hayes, who is tall, blond, and slender. But looks aside, Davis delivers a sensational performance in a film that purports to tell the true story of Hayes's ordeal but which fails in several key places to do so.For starters, Hayes's book didn't tell the whole story (he has revealed this recently, claiming rather ambiguously that it was necessary to fictionalize certain things ""to protect certain persons.""); neither the book nor the film tells the truth about Hayes's smuggling: it was not a one-time thing; he had been doing it for several years and the only reason that he was caught this time was that security at Middle Eastern airports was increased in the aftermath of a recent bombing in the region (I forget where). On previous occasions he was able to board the plane carrying several kilos of hashish because the airport officials barely noticed him; on this occasion they were frisking everyone and that's how he got caught.But I digress; the film, like the book, is primarily about Hayes's experience at Sagmalcilar prison. And here's where the most egregious dishonesty is to be found in Parker's film. All the Turks are depicted as stereotypical sadists who take delight in abusing the prisoners. In Hayes's book there was one such individual, but in the film the whole prison staff appears to be cut from the same piece of cloth.The film's depiction of Hayes himself has problems. For one thing, he never threw the legendary temper tantrum in the courtroom; neither did he bite off a prison guard's tongue. And what may be the film's most famous scene is also a lie: a fellow inmate makes sexual advances towards Billy, who gently but firmly rebuffs him; in fact Billy and this inmate had a love affair that lasted until the other inmate left the prison.Despite all these plot holes, the film is eminently watchable and Davis throws himself into the role of Hayes with an intensity and abandon that should have gotten him an Oscar nomination. It must be said, however, that while this film tells its story very well, there are good and valid reasons that the Turkish people consider it insulting and offensive. A pity, because what the film does well it does exceedingly well.",Midnight Express
74,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Superbly enjoyable film,10,11 November 2013,"The criticisms concerning the political correctness of this film don't really concern me. PC is not something that I knew anything about when I first saw this film as a teenager, nor now as an adult concerning matters between the USA and Turkey.This is a story about a guy who tries to smuggle a couple of kilos of dope but without planning events or thinking about the consequences too well. He gets caught and the engrossing story ensues.There are all sort of moments in this film that will stick with me forever. The terrible pronunciation of the name 'William Hayes' by the Turkish official trying to write it down; the very affecting role by brilliant John Hurt; the corrupt prison warden and his obese, wobbling along kids; the excruciating but almost funny ""s'il vous plait"" pleading at his girlfriend to reveal her breasts in the private interview booth; the very dislikeable mental patient and his comments about being broken machines and not knowing that they're broken. Memories that are ingrained in my mind forever.The film looks and feels a bit grainy by today's standards and maybe some of the prison conditions are no longer up-to-date or relevant, but the story relates a series of events that any one of us could have found ourselves in if we had made the same misguided decisions in the past. After the initial airport arrest, events start to spiral downwards, at first clinging to hope that release would be imminent, getting legal counselling and paying bribes to reduce the sentence from smuggling to mere possession, ultimately leading to life incarceration, giving up on life itself and leading to madness.The friends gained along the way, including the decision not get involved in gay activities, the attempts to escape and the enemies made in certain quarters are a fundamental part of this terrific tale.It's in my list of 20/30 favourites, I guess.",Midnight Express
75,blazesnakes9,Journey into the heart of brutality,10,5 October 2014,"Billy Hayes was just an American, trying to get home to his family. He and his girlfriend were vacationing in Turkey for a while. But, Billy decided to smuggle hashish out of the country. Before he boards the plane, he is stopped by the Turkish airport police and is caught with the hashish, strapped onto his stomach and body. This is only the beginning of a story that is filled with spellbinding terror and sheer bravery. Midnight Express tells that kind of story. The movie is based on the real-life Billy Hayes, who was caught smuggling hashish across the border from Turkey. Risking his life and his dignity, he tries to escape from the authorities, but fails. Knowing that he will face the consequences, Hayes is sentenced to prison for 4 years. In those 4 years, Hayes suffers through a series of unflinching, excruciating torture. When his parole is denied, Billy decides to escape from prison with the help of two other fellow prisoners. The movie has an amazing array of great performances by Brad Davis, who plays Billy Hayes, and also John Hurt as the Englishman, who's befriends Hayes during his prison sentence. Randy Quaid also plays a supporting role in the movie as Hayes' other fellow prisoner. Quaid is spectacular, showing us that his star power is expanding since his supporting role in The Last Detail.The only performance that I really cared a lot was Brad Davis. Davis is a newcomer in the film industry at that time during the making of this movie and he is very convincing as Billy Hayes. Whenever he was placed under such extreme violence, I cared more about his survival and especially his willingness to escape from this hellish prison. Since Davis is new to all of us, that's very important to the movie because it creates authenticity for the story. If Davis was not cast in the movie, then the movie would've never been effective as it is now. Most movies tend to star big-name actors because the director or producer thinks that we can relate to these big-name stars as realistic characters. Sometimes that does worked. But, here, the acting is very effective and honest.The music score by Giorgio Moroder is also effective since the music doesn't have a triumphant orchestral feeling to the movie. Moroder's score illustrates a world that's filled with danger and hostility. His synthesized music score is well done and like the acting, it brings something new to the table. When audiences listen to certain music scores in movies, they tend to listen to something that can coincides with the look of the movie. Here, the score is played directly toward the audience's involvement. Imagine if you were put inside this movie. This score would never been done if it wasn't for the acting and also, the story.Midnight Express takes us into a world where the only thing that can keep you alive in a world of hurt is bravery. Some people might think that sympathizing with Billy Hayes is something that we all can't do. What I say to that is place yourself in this environment. How would you feel if you had to undergo such extreme torture? What would you do? Would you escape? Or would you embraced the harsh brutality of human despair? That's what makes Midnight Express great. It's honest about human nature. Hayes isn't just a typical movie hero. He is a everyday person who's makes the fatal mistake of smuggling drugs. His story is so emotional and shattering that we really understand what he's going through. The movie is played for sympathy. We can care for him or despise him for his actions. But, the true heart of the story is the willingness to move on and go where your instincts tells you.One thing that I would like to say is I didn't care about was the representation of Turks as being bad people. I know that isn't true. Similar to The Deer Hunter, where the critics blasted it for portraying the Vietnamese as killers and racists, Midnight Express tells a honest story about human nature in a sub-ordinate environment. People do get hurt both physically and emotionally by other people. Just because they hurt people doesn't make them bad people. The movie isn't just a routine prison movie. The movie is about a human story. This is the same set-up with The Deer Hunter. It isn't just a war story. It's a human story. That is a big misunderstanding. The violence in Midnight Express is not glorified in any way. The scenes that showed the torture is very well-directed by Alan Parker. Parker, at certain times during the movie, cuts away from the brutal sadistic activities. With his idea of turning away from the violence, we can actually see what it would look like. But, I'm glad he didn't overboard with the torture scenes. I know that people might think that the scenes involving the violence is too much to handle. Some might say that it's over the top. I believe that the violence illustrates the Turkish prison as Hell. It paints a unhappy world of cruel people who do inhumane activities to others. Yet, it isn't glorification. It's honesty. And that what makes this movie worth watching. It's the craftsmanship of what movies are all about. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Midnight Express
76,jbartelone,"Very Powerful Film, Despite Several Distortions of The Real Story.",9,9 March 2007,"Midnight Express tells the story of a young American, Billy Hayes, who was arrested in 1970 for possession of Hashish in Istanbul Turkey. The film chronicles Billy's journey into the nightmarish hell of the Turkish prison. Slowly, the viewer begins to see how Billy's personality begins to change from a fun-loving individual, to a decaying vegetable as the justice system betrays him. Originally sentenced to 4 years and two months, the head prosecutor successfully appeals the verdict to the Turkish Supreme Court, forcing the trial court judge to resentence Billy to a minimum of 30 years.The torture scenes involving Billy getting sadistically beaten by the prison guard Hamadu are very painful to watch, especially a scene early on in the film where Billy is strung up by his ankles and beaten on a rack for taking a blanket without permission. Billy and his inmates escape plans provide great dramatic tension in a terrific narrative style. Ultimately, Billy engages in a brutal fight with an inmate named Rifki, whom everyone hates, especially Billy, because Rifki rats on all of the prisoners. Rifki likes to make life even more miserable for the inmates. As punishment, Billy is sent to the prison's Section 13 for the criminally insane.Billy is given bribe money by his girlfriend Susan who comes to see him in a heartbreaking scene. Almost all of Billy's inner-strength is taken away by the harsh realities of the prison. However, he is able to say ""I love you"" through many tears.The head guard Hamidou refuses to be bought, and takes Billy to the Sanitarium where he beats him, and tries to have sex with him. Billy charges the guard, rams the guard's head into a spike on the wall, killing him. Stealing his uniform, Billy escapes the prison and shortly afterward we learn that he arrived home with his family 3 weeks later.I have actually read Billy Hayes' book, Midnight Express. In reality, Billy did not have any major quarrels with the Turkish people. The film shows the opposite. There was really only one guard that treated him badly, but nowhere near what Hamidou did in the movie. In reality, Billy never was transferred to the insane part of the prison for fighting. He had one minor altercation with an inmate. The book talks more about the unsanitary conditions of the prison. (There are many instances in the book that will make you want to surrender your lunch, unfortunately.)The biggest distortion is that in real-life, Billy Hayes never killed any guard as a part of his escape plan. He simply got out one night and swam across the boarder into Greece and that was it.There are differences in how the film was made as well. The Turkish Government was outraged at how this movie distorted the real Billy Hayes case and refused to allow the movie to be filmed there. Most of the film was shot off the island of Malta. A good deal of the language spoken in the movie is NOT Turkish, but Maltese, which to the untrained ear, is often mistaken for Turkish dialect.Nevertheless, I rate the film highly because it is still a very good movie with great acting, music, and dramatic tension. Amazingly, the actor who played Billy Hayes, Brad Davis, died of AIDS. He did an excellent job as the real Billy Hayes. In my view, many scenes had to be changed for dramatic effect. You will remember this film forever. It will undoubtedly make you think twice about doing something stupid in a foreign country! Despite its flaws, when compared to Billy Hayes' real-life story, Midnight Express is still a very emotional film that withstands the test of time. It would be a 10/10 if it were closer to the truth. However, the film is still excellent and is strongly recommended viewing.",Midnight Express
77,chthon2,"Great, But Stereotyping and Not Completely True",8,14 April 2003,"Based on a book by William Hayes, we follow him, as played by Brad Davis, on his trip into a Turkish prison and his eventual escape.  Alan Parker does a wonderful job directing, and, from an artistic point of view, Oliver Stone wrote a truly good and unique script.There are some problems, though.  Hayes himself said some time after this film that most of the bad things that happened to Davis in the film never happened to him.  One of the guards was mean to them, and he got in a fight with another prisoner in his first week, but that was it.  Stone greatly exagerated the truth here, although if you've seen anything else Stone has done, you know that's normal for him.This is also very stereotyping.  The real Hayes was not a racist, and even though there aren't many gay people in Turkey, it isn't banned.  All the Turkish characters are also ugly and mean; they could have at least made one of his cell mates to humanize them a bit.  Turkish prisons are also no as bad as this; to get a more accurate picture, see Yol (1982).Regardless, this film is a classic and enjoyable if you're not Turkish.  The acting is superb, and Peter Jeffrey as Ahmet is fantastic in his cameo.  The film is done well, we're with Billy all the way (he broke the law, but suffered far too much for it), and the fight scene with Billy and Rifki is the most realistic and violent fight scene in the history of film in any country, ever.  That fight scene will haunt me at night for the rest of my life.",Midnight Express
78,tmpj,An Engaging Thriller.....,5,14 September 2010,"American citizens traveling overseas to certain destinations can be assured of hardships and hassles...this was true even prior to the hi-jacking days. Those who were dealing in drugs and contraband were really living dangerously. In some countries it is a death sentence merely to be caught with such contraband. The facts about Hayes are not fully explained as to his motives...we can assume that it was financial motivation. That, coupled with his inexperience and his up-bringing in what was still sheltered middle or upper middle class America at that point in time, kicked in to make his downfall all the more difficult. He is busted with hash at the airport as he leaves Istanbul. His girlfriend travels on to her destination, and spreads the bad news to the family at home. This film was, at the time, one of the first of the realistic prison shockers, knocking down the old images of Cagney and Bogart, and replacing them with as near to the real world as would be permitted by the censors in the late 1970s. Prison life is no game in America...and in Istanbul it appears to be almost completely Darwinian. A four year sentence gets overturned, and is replace by a 30 year sentence. By then, Hayes and his cohorts feel they have nothing to lose by trying to escape, and they almost succeed...until they are turned in by one of the snitches. Hopes are consistently raised, and dashed, and raised again, and dashed again. Finally Hayes manages an escape...one that I will not spoil in case there are late arrivals to this film, like myself. It is a bit hard to follow, and you must pay close attention. They speak in what appears to be Turkish dialect in many of the scenes and not all scenes or sentences are well translated, so you must use your powers of deduction to realize what is happening at certain points. But it is power packed, and is a film well worth seeing, though if you let your kids watch it, be there to help them along...or maybe in today's world, some parents may need to have the kids watching with them so that the kids can make an accurate social assessment. Either way, see the film. It is more of worthwhile watch than I first imagined.",Midnight Express
79,turkam,"Pure, racist trash",1,3 July 2002,"If this film were made about almost any other group besidse the Turks (I am half-Turkish, Half-American), it would have never been made. I respect Alan Parker for several of his other films, most notably ""The Commitments,"" but this film has no merit whatsoever. It completely turns around the events in the book. The finale (not to spoil for those of you who haven't seen it- sarcasm intended!) is a complete fabrication and never happened. Most people who have been to my fathter's country enjoy their stay. I'm sorry Billy Hayes had to smuggle drugs and see an ugly side of the country. But, he took a stupid risk. Turkey has since made considerable improvements in the area of human rights since this film was made.

The acting is terrific from the supporting cast but I wasn't overly impressed with the leading actor playing Billy Hayes, he laid it on a bit thick at times. As I read about the movie I concluded as others have, that this movie isn't based entirely on reality. The author himself has said the movie has little to do with what actually happened to him. Yeah, it's a bit racist against the Turks as well. Yet, it's a movie and you have to accept that this isn't the true story at all.

82,Exiled_Archangel,Disgustingly subjective! Purely racist trash!,1,1 February 2004,"Ok I'll try not to be subjective as the movie itself while judging it, whereas it'll be hard. Now, it has its pluses and minuses like all the movies ever made in the history of cinema. Nothing wrong with that for sure. What's wrong, though, is that, the minuses override the pluses in this movie BIG TIME! Life in a Turkish prison might not be anywhere close to a vacation in Hawaii, but the situation is exaggerated 5 million times in this movie. First of all, foreigners are always treated nicer than locals in Turkey, in all aspects of society, including the prisons. Second, this Hayes guy wasn't imprisoned just because everyone in the prison was ugly and the prison needed a handsome detainee, he was imprisoned because he was trafficking DRUGS! Even in Holland, where the law permits the use of hash, trafficking so much stuff would be enough to make one look at the world through the jail bars. For those who don't know: There was another American guy who went to prison in Turkey at about the same time as Hayes, for the same crime. And upon watching this revolting movie, he wrote a book about his experience in the ""tourist cell"" of a Turkish prison, and he clearly states Hayes is a big time BS thrower and his life in the Turkish prison was exactly as good as a life in any prison could have been. So one could easily tell that the storyline on this movie is not necessarily imaginary, but an absolute exaggeration of the reality.
Enough about the story, now let's talk about the cinematography itself. Well.. It's BAD! The Turkish lawyer and the Turkish prisoners speaking Turkish with an Italian accent, the Turkish judge speaking Turkish with an American accent, the Turkish prosecutor played by an Armenian terrorist speaking in a terrible Armenian accent.. That's hillarious! Also, everyone who plays a Turkish role in the movie is ugly as hell. Women all wear ninja-suits. Well, what else? Or do we need any other reason to say this movie is a failure? It's so obvious that the director is tearing up his rear to make Turks and Turkey look bad. And if it takes such an obvious try to do that, it means his filmmaking skills are not good enough to manifest his message. If you want to see a movie that's showing things 0 out of which are the least bit real, and if you want to lose all your respect to director Alan Parker, go watch this movie right now! But if you just want a good movie, avoid it at all costs, it'll make you nauseous.",Midnight Express
83,Wulfstan10,"Artistically excellent, but utterly, inexcusably prejudiced",2,7 October 2005,"I have a hard time even talking about this film, much less giving it an overall rating, but felt compelled to. My rating of 2 is somewhat arbitrary, but it certainly represents my overall opinion of this film when considering both purely artistic/film-making elements and the disgusting bias of the film. My discussion is thus in two basic parts that do not really interrelate, but I think that anyone must consider both these aspects of the film.Artistically, this film is for the most part simply excellent. The cinematography, visuals, acting, etc. are all top-notch. The use of shadows, perspective, lighting, smoke, etc., are incredible and excellent for creating a strange, surreal, and utterly frightening impression. Even here, though, there are some problems, though not with the visuals, etc. My main problem for a cinematic point of view, and the one that does tie into the other overarching problem with this film, is how it portrays the main character, essentially a none-too-bright, low-life drug smuggler as some sort of victimized hero. Even if he does not necessarily deserve the treatment he is shown receiving in the film, it is hard to feel much sympathy for such a character. The film even goes so far as to try to evoke sympathy and care for another loser character who complains that he was put in prison for stealing candlesticks or something like that from a mosque. How is one supposed to empathize with scum like that? In the US, that'd be like stealing from from a church and I don't think most people here would view such conduct very highly. It is especially hard to sympathize with such a character when he portrays no remorse for what he did, but instead turns it around on the supposedly ""evil"" Turks.This segues into the fundamental problem with this film, which is so inexcusably, thoroughly, and groundlessly prejudiced that this aspect of the film almost utterly negates its artistic value. Not only are the events at least somewhat fictionalized in a way that makes the Turks look worse, but every element of this film is bursting with what seems like simple disgust and hatred for Turks and Turkey without any foundation. Every single thing about the Turks is used to make them look monstrous and inhuman, while the city of Istanbul, an enthralling, beautiful, and vibrant city (although admittedly, the 1970s was something of a low point in the city's life and status), is shown as scary and bizarre. An example is the story about stealing from a mosque, mentioned above. The film even goes so far as to imply that stealing candles from a mosque isn't that bad because, after all, it's ""just a Turkish mosque,"" which is utterly ridiculous and disgusting. Even anti-Turkish racial/ethnic slurs are bluntly stated as if they are totally justified. No culture in the world, now or ever, is even remotely as bad as the Turks are shown here, and I can't think of another film I have ever seen that makes any other nation, ethnic, or political group (not even Nazi-era Germans) look so demonic. I am not a Turk, but I have also been to Turkey several times and I can say from personal experience that Turkey and Turks bear absolutely no resemblance to the nation portrayed here.I want to emphasize that I am not trying to use this as a soap box to espouse political or social views about any country, etc. My discussion of Turkey and the bigotry and falsehoods in the movie are only intended as a discussion about the merits of this film. I touch on the accuracy, etc., of any film that is supposedly about ""real"" events, people, places, etc. I would have made the same criticisms had it shown any people or nation the way it shows Turks.",Midnight Express
84,anxiousgayhorseonketamine,watch something else ...,3,1 March 2020,"As fate would have it I watched Almanya a film about the Turkish experience in Germany over the last 50 years .... then a day later I found myself watching Midnight Express .... a sobering experience seeing this 40 years later.
At the time this film had a cult following and pretty much defined the image of Turkey in the minds of many for many years to come (AND HERE IS THE CRIME).HA but here is the thing. It is unbelievably racist all the Turks in the film are brutal devious the lawyer is fat underhand and greedy ... the judges are played by Ankara and unable to do their job .... it paints a very grim picture of that country and its people; Bill Hayes the real-life protagonist and writer of the book this was based on complained after the event that all the violent behaviour and cruelty had not been present in his memory (see Stone the writer)
On the other hand any English speaker is portrayed as noble in some way even the junky played by Hurt ... and the boy smuggler.The American father feels it is ok to racially insult the head guard in the prison since he is after all Ummerrikkan ie from a superior race and culture although his son tried to smuggle 2 kg of dope; subtext is ""how dare these barbarians lock up an American boy"". Apology of everything American follows with the usual cliches ... back in 78 this film was revered as was Alan Parker for making it .... we probably will not be surprised that subtlemeister Oliver Stone penned the scenario.Watching this 40 years later your jaw drops .... the times have really moved on on that score and we can be grateful for that ... blatant racism contained in this ""opus"" would no longer be allowed/wished for/lauded

Compared to later movies of a similar nature it hasn't fared well. It now lacks shock value of any kind. The lack of foreign subtiltles was annoying, although I can understand it was done so the viewer would be in the same position as Hayes. The musical score is so annoying today.

The depiction of prison situations and the resemblance of the lead actor to the original Billy Hayes is striking and was enough to create the buzz it generated after its release, much towards the negative side for Turkish Tourism for many years.

Brad Davis gives one of my all-time favorite performances, in a baring role, and watching this film again makes me wish that Davis hadn't died so young as I don't think we got all the performances he was capable of from him. The situation is nightmarish and the portrayal is extremely effective in the use of score, Oliver Stone's script, and the acting ability of Brad Davis.

Neither have I.And even if you had some historical knowledge that would contradict some of the aspects of this movie...rape,violence and grim facilities ARE features of almost any prison.And anyway,it is through the subjective eyes of Hayes that we see the whole thing,it is not a news report. So I do not understand why you are so defensive about it. For the ""this is not what really happened"" commentators:I am really surprised that you can watch some propaganda junk like ""The Patriot"" and ravel about how real it is, and yet attack this movie for not sticking with the real story of William Hayes. At least it got the atmosphere right,which is more than enough for its purpose. The nationalist comments that I read here are pathetic. If you are a Turk and you are offended by this movie you are either a fanatical idiot or just maybe you recognize yourself in the characters. Please don't this comment personally.2. This movie is stunning. Not because of the story but because of the WAY the story was told and because of the acting.John Hurt was so convincing and transposed ! Because at the time I first saw the movie I was not familiar with any of his movies, I didn't realize that it was John Hurt until 10 years later, even though by then I had seen lots of movies with him. Quaid was also incredible. As for Brad Davis, no other could have been better.No matter how many times I see this movie, the emotions of William Hayes are there with me (and I have watched it at least 50 times).In particular, the masturbation scene is one of the gutsiest scenes I have ever seen in movies. The movie does succeed, in the most convincing way, to turn you into a voyeur of William Hays' torments. Parker and Stone made an excellent team,and the actors were equally matched.Drama at its best.If this movie would come out now,it would be a disaster at the box-office, I would think. Who would want to see a REAL movie like this one when you can watch Vin Diesel driving cars for 90 minutes or Ben Affleck shooting Japanese and German planes and managing to f*** the prom queen in the same time?

94,thomasmitilis1995,CATCH THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS...,7,14 April 2020,"PROS:The film captures perfectly the injuctice that exists in the world. Brad Davis portrays a man that endures the cruelty of the prison system, the corruption of the prison guards and the encroachment of his rights. Through his eyes you see the loneliness and the madness in which a hopeless person could be led into. Hopkins and Hurt give solid performances and the soundtrack is mesmerizing.
CONS:Some political views of the movie have not aged well. Many turkish characters overact their roles and they are presented unrealistically mean and cartoonish. Moreover, the gay scene between Davis and Hurt is a little out of place and underdeveloped.",Midnight Express
95,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,An eye-opening experience.,8,29 January 2014,"If you think that there is nothing worse than death, then you have not seen Midnight Express. Midnight Express tells the tale of a young American who gets caught smuggling drugs out of Turkey. The film pulls no punches in showing the experiences of the captives in the Turkish prison. It's intense, gritty and, at times, downright disturbing. It seems like everybody in Midnight Express is covered in dirt and then coated with a layer of sweat. It's this kind of realism that makes Midnight Express a great film. It's too bad more films today don't follow its blueprint. Midnight Express didn't worry about how much the audience could handle. They wanted to show prison life for what it is and succeeded. Studios today are too worried about scaring away the audience, when they should be more worried about making a great film. Midnight Express deserves to be placed on any list of great prison films, along with The Great Escape, Papillon, The Shawshank Redemption and Bridge on the River Kwai (yes, it's a prison film, not a war film.) It perfectly depicts what a person goes through in prison both mentally and physically. There are truly some things worse than death, lets just hope you won't have to visit a Turkish prison to realize that fact.",Midnight Express
96,andrejvasiljevic,A man on Mars.,8,6 September 2012,"""Midnight Express"" is the best prison brake flick I've seen by far. Although It's very loosely based on the book by William Hayes, and twists the reality quite some, the story brings to light the most important aspect into light - being lost in another world.Going behind bars is tough. I haven't had that pleasure yet and I honestly hope I won't be getting it, but one can only imagine how hard is to find yourself in a world without freedom, privacy or any commodity. Furthermore, being locked up in such an inferno on the other side of the world makes one feel like being on a different planet. And that's a binding fact which is present both in the book as well as in the film. For known reasons it wasn't filmed in Turkey, and yet, the substitute Maltese surrounding Parker chose managed to project the atmosphere of an oriental prison in full. Personally, I admire Hayes's courage to withstand all the hardships during all those years. I'd probably end up like Max...Parker has generally shown a great deal of talent as a director. It's a pity such talent wasn't applied on the silver screen some more. Acting - one of the best Anglo-American co-ops on screen. John Hurt brilliant as ever, Randy Quaid in the role of his life and finally the refreshing Brad Davis, whose talent never got to shine as bright as in ""Midnight Express"". The ""Turkish"" (Maltese-Italian) cast did their job just as fine. Still, ""Midnight Express"" wouldn't have been nearly such a success without Giorgio Moroder's soundtrack. It's a perfect example how each segment of a motion picture makes up to it's role, thus creating a full cinematic experience.""Midnight Express"" is a timeless classic, an action drama which will keep you focused until the last minute, no matter how many times You watch it.

101,Sisiutil,"Very good movie, but did they have to demonize an entire nation?",8,30 August 2001,"First of all, let me say that I think this is a very good movie--riveting, controversial, thought-provoking. I've seen it a couple of times, and I've never been able to forget it.Brad Davis gives one hell of a performance, and much of the success for the movie goes to him. He had to take an unsympathetic character--a drug smuggler, albeit an extremely amateurish one--and make him sympathetic, and he does so. Oliver Stone deserves some credit here too, since he wrote the script, and successfully characterizes Billy's smuggling as the foolish mistake of a callow young man rather than the plot of an evil mastermind.The film challenges its viewers to care about some unappealing people, and to watch them persevere through some harrowing experiences. It raises questions about crime and punishment, the possibility of redemption, and what the human spirit can endure. It's too easy to think the film is only trying to say ""don't get involved with drugs"" or ""Turkey is evil"". There are much bigger questions being raised here.That said, I remember being aware during my first viewing that there were no sympathetic Turkish characters, and that the entire country was being portrayed in a light so dim you'd be hard-pressed not to bump into your own prejudices. American movies have never been good at portraying Middle-Eastern cultures positively. I can't think of one that does, in fact. Yet even the most simple-minded movies of recent years take steps to portray at least one sympathetic foil to the villainous culture of the piece (True Lies comes to mind). Oliver Stone, however, never does that here, and it's what keeps the movie from being great. I don't know what there is in Stone's history that made him hate Turkey so much, and maybe I don't want to know. I've been to Turkey, and loved the country and its people; I fully intend to go back there one day. I found most Turks to be overwhelmingly friendly, gregarious, and open of both mind and heart--especially outside the bustle of Istanbul. Turkey is one of the most forward-looking and liberal of the Arab nations, and prides itself on that fact. No, it's not perfect--their persecution of the Kurds particularly rankles--but no nation is. I'm not proud of my own country's record when it comes to aboriginal rights, for example. Frankly, the movie would have been much MORE successful had it shown that even in such a welcoming and friendly country, the worst side of human nature can still emerge--especially in the dark crevices of society which few people care to examine, such as the prison system. Do you really think similar abuses don't take place in American or Canadian prisons? Come on.I can still watch and enjoy this movie (although I'm not sure ""enjoy"" is really the right term, but anyway...). But only if I shut out its demonization of all things Turkish--which is, of course, not entirely possible. I recommend it, but watch it with a very necessary grain of salt.",Midnight Express

103,MovieMan-112,one of the greatest prison movies of all time,10,2 January 2000,"Midnight Express is right up there with The Shawshank Redemption, Cool Hand Luke, and Bad Boys. The story of how one american was sentenced to life in a turkish prison just for trying to smuggle hashish back to the united states is fabulous. The beginning scene perfectly captures the smuggler's horror and nervousness as he's passing through customs and trying to get on the plane without being caught. There is a loud and fast heartbeat on the soundtrack that gives the scene a triumphant effect on how one person must feel when they are terrified. The rest of the film depicts the smuggler's torturous life in the prison, his tolerance, courage, strength, and eventually his chance to finally escape. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good movies.",Midnight Express
104,heywood100,"Good, but flawed in character depiction",8,21 January 2003,"Midnight Express is an excellent prison drama written by Oliver Stone of Platoon and Born On The 4th Of July fame. It follows American Billy Hayes, who gets arrested in Turkey while trying to take drugs over the border. The officials make him a scapegoat by giving him a life sentence, and he spends the next few years facing the brutality of the prison guards and making ill-fated plans to catch `the Midnight Express` (escape).Midnight Express' biggest problem is that it's really not all that shocking. Someone gets beaten up occasionally, there's a few scuffles in the exercise yard, the prison's sort of grimy, and one of the characters takes drugs. This isn't helped by the stylish, glossy lighting. It's really nothing that modern audiences won't have seen in a much gorier format already. Where it really excels is in the acting department. Brad Davis is excellent, and Randy Quaid and John Hurt provide good support. Also, the Oscar winning score is fantastic.The opening scene, with Hayes trying to sneak through customs with 2 kilos of hashish attached to his torso are wonderfully tense, even though you know he has to get caught at some point (it wouldn't be much of a prison movie otherwise). From then on, the film takes the same philosophy as Fight Club - to escape from his life in prison, get redemption, and start again Billy has to completely hit rock bottom and pay for his crime. Max the Englishman doesn't face up to this responsibility and escapes the reality of his situation through a drug-induced stupor, and so he doesn't get the same chance.Although many have (rightly) derided the film for it's demonisation of the Turks, it wouldn't be an Oliver Stone movie if it didn't take at least a side-swipe at America as well. In this case, Billy is clearly portrayed as a Turk-hating racist, making him a less sympathetic character in my eyes, and his father is constantly talking of ways to cheat Billy out of the legal system so he can escape to Greece. He seems to completely ignore the fact that his son is a criminal and takes out his anger verbally on the Turkish guards. And of course, it's only the Turks being portrayed negatively because that's were Billy got arrested in reality. This is a mainstream Hollywood film, so of course it needs to have clear cut bad guys to appeal to the masses. If Billy had been arrested in any other Eastern country, it would have been them shown in this negative light. It's not Turkey's fault that they happened to arrest him, but the film obviously wouldn't have had much success if the story was: Billy Hayes gets arrested in Turkey, everyone treats him nicely, he gets out and goes home. It just happens that he got arrested in Turkey, so it is the Turks who are portrayed in a bad light in order to make Billy in to some kind of `hero'. That's the way Hollywood moviemaking was, and still is.It's not quite a ten-out-of-ten bona fide classic, mainly because of the overly simple portrayal of the Turks, but it takes a disturbing look at issues of escape, redemption, and punishment, and doesn't take the overly straightforward standpoint that a major Hollywood prison film might be expected to take. Personally, I preferred Midnight Express to that other great escape film, The Shawshank Redemption.",Midnight Express
105,msultan,synthesizers haven't aged well,8,22 June 2003,"Generally speaking, I have a problem with westerners who travelabroad, brake the law, insult the country, and expect specialtreatment because of their citizenship, yet this is pretty common allover the Middle East and Asia.This being said, prison stories are are always exciting, andMidnight Express is no exception. It's a very well-made movie,except for the cultural mistakes (mosques don't have candles;Muslims don't pray the way they're portrayed to, and Turkish, Arabic-and apparently Maltese (languages)- are confused).  I don'tunderstand why everyone describes this prison as hell though:they're not confined to a cell, they smoke up as much as they want,they're allowed packages from outside, they get to hang out in thecourtyard, read, etc.  I was expecting more violence, but theprisoners are actually 'punished' only when they screw up, they'renot randomly tortured.  I'm not saying it's fun; this is a prison afterall.Before watching Midnight Express, I knew that the music wasfamous but had forgotten what it was. It was funny to hear it, Icouldn't take it very seriously. Amazing performances from everyone, and the mise en scenewas great too.  Yet, no matter how political Alan Parker's moviesget, there's something missing. There was something missing inMississippi Burning and there's something missing in this one aswell.

After watching The Learning Channel about great prison breaks,i had to go and rent this movie. Oliver stone delivers as always the sheer magnetic horror of how a persons life can be turned upside down through one mistake. Getting caught at the airport with hash stuffed in his boots and shirt billy was sentenced to an original fifteen years until it was overturned to thirty. This made an all too clear idea to billy Hayes that he was going nowhere except insane in his mind. But as history tells it,he was the very first human prisoner to escape a Turkish prison. Making him the all time number one escapee. Making it to Greece he was almost turned back to turkey until an agent spoke on his behalf to the American consulate,giving him his freedom once again. He never stepped foot back on Turkish soil,and he also had given speeches about his plight back home in schools and drug rehab centers,hopefully opening the eyes of people who dwell on the idea of trying to make it big in the drug trade.

What a movie, not much goes on here, but you do not breathe, it's a torture, a waterfall of emotions. Uauuuuu, what a movie, howling!

110,Weredegu,Prisoner of a foreign land,8,28 January 2007,"At times gut-wrenching prison drama from UK director Alan Parker, director of 'Birdy' later on, about an American's gauntlet in Turkey's justice system. Surrounded by heated debate over its way of dramatizing the original book and consequently over the film-makers' motives. In other words, this is great film-making at the expense of accuracy in the portrayal of what happened and at the expense of hurting Turkish national feelings.(You may find a minor spoiler in this paragraph, suggested rather for those in the know.) In my view, the main message of that most controversial part of the movie is that while it is neither right, nor wise to talk at a Turkish court about how, unlike you, Jesus () might forgive the 'nation of pigs' you name Turks to be (especially since they aren't, of course), you might consider doing just that after spending a couple of years in a Turkish prison (and that prison term of yours should be in the 1970s, for that might make a difference). So the film-makers' point is: under the circumstances you might do things that are not right. Trivial, isn't it? Too trivial, I think, for it to generate all the 'we, this'-'you, that' talk seen on message boards. Just think of how the Turkish judge even apologizes to a degree for the sentence he has to read out after the above cited remarks that could be very offending to him. The judge understands what Hayes is going through and why he is saying what he is saying  and the judge's character is the film-makers' creation. The rest of the changes to the original story are, I think, not a deliberate offense to, rather only ignorance of Turkish feelings.As far as circumstances in Turkish prisons are concerned, one certainly wouldn't be right in citing another movie such as Yilmaz Güney's 'The Wall' ('Duvar', 1983) as proof of anything, but its picture of Turkish prisons is no less brutal. As to what the situation is nowadays, if you're really interested, read human rights reports, judge for yourself.",Midnight Express
111,FrankNSteinSinatra,Americans overestimate their importance,5,27 October 2019,"I'm not sure what Oliver Stone meant when he wrote this, in his later works the message is more obvious. Also the director Alan Parker has made some cult classics better than this. Personally, I don't have reason to hate americans as humans (their aggressive foreign policy yes) but either the main character was not especially sympathetic. He committed a crime, was thrown in jail, and -despite having a girlfriend- his efforts did not reflect manliness and he did not show remorse at any point. A good looking american guy in a Middle-East country, smuggling two kilos of hash in selling purpose, why they couldn´t just forgive him? Was he Papillon who was wrongly convicted? I mean, the more uglier character and from non-Western country, who would have cared less? Today is also know fact, that CIA exports heroin from Afghanistan, so the ""morality"" of this movie seems even more ridiculous. (The music btw is close to George Michael's mega hit ""Careless Whisper"", he apparently was strongly influenced by gayish character's fate).

Either IMDb is populated with Turkish ex-cons or they don't know and are wrong (seeing that no one ever is freed from a Turkish prison). And if Billy Hayes was such a threat to the kind, gentle Turkish society and deserved a life sentence, why didn't the Turkish gov't deport him?I guess I could criticize the character development of the prison guards as shallow and one-sided. I am sure they had many redeeming qualities that if more fully explored would explain that the torture was just symptomatic of deeper, inner pain experienced as children.At any rate, I am sure Joey knew that Turkish prison guards and Captain Oveur's suggestion couldn't be any good, even without seeing this movie or reading IMDb comments from Turkish ex-cons!",Midnight Express

Only five years into his more than 30 year film making career, Midnight Express came along almost ten years ahead of his Angel Heart and Mississippi Burning, masterpieces. This is a movie that can't quite make up its mind about the story or stories it wants to tell, and which also seems unable to settle into a coherent storytelling style. We don't really understand why Bill is so bent on stashing hashish on a return flight from Turkey, where he is well aware of the harsh consequences of capture. The relationship with his girlfriend and his father, are sketchy, almost to the point of irrelevance, yet these are clearly extremely important. We have no idea why he bonds with three particular fellow prisoners, but yet again, these relationships are front and centre. Alan is clearly struck by the alien-ness of Turkish culture, which he themes in almost mystical tones. The harshness of Bill's imprisonment is intensified by this sense of a complete severing from any culturally familiar references. He is indeed a stranger in a strange land, rendered helpless and unable to speak or understand the language of the strangers who surround him. This powerful rendering of mysticism and alienation, are effective ways to convey experience, but don't fare so well in expressing the nuances within relationships. The characters of his fellow inmates lack coherence, and while their shared imprisonment does explain how they come to care for one another, the issue of intimacy is handled rather clumsily. Other key plot details throughout the movie are delivered in a way that makes them seem contrived and bolted on. Whilst this could have been in the interests of brevity, or to appease controversy; they also reveal a director who has yet to find his métier, and who is struggling at the limits of his ability to deliver a coherent vision. Midnight Express remains a powerful, if somewhat confused story of a nightmarishly strange incarceration.

Although I forgot much of it, I was underwhelmed by the plot and characters a second time through. While there is an adrenaline rush related to Billy's capture, the movie bogs down into a typical prison movie. While there are flashes of brilliance, it does not have the oomph of Cool Hand Luke or Shawshank Redemption where we love the main character. The problem is the main character is Billy Hayes. While I initially found myself rooting for him, after awhile, I found him to be a selfish, violent sociopath who deserved his plight. It was not the actor's fault, but the character development. Billy wasn't a nice guy. Billy's friend, the William Hurt character, was an annoying low talker who spoke cryptically, making his dialogue impossible to understand. The ending escape was a concocted, ""let's end this movie somehow"" and let's make sure the sadistic guard gets killed.

Not heroin, but hashish. Bloody idiot. He should've tried it out of Amsterdam; at least the prisons would've been more comfortable. The depiction of the prisons as an unrelenting horror zone and a random justice system, irritated the Turks no end at the time with them threatening to stop the export of Turkish coffee and the misnamed Turkish delights to the US. And who else to do the irritating but the most maverick of the mainstream; Alan Parker. While you have lots of individualist directors, they tend to be limited to a very art house crowd. And spread their messages in the most doom ridden, clichéd ways. (Sorry, Mike Leigh). Alan parker, on the other hand, has done what the hell he likes; taking unfilmable works and making them his own in an original, accessible way.

So he knows how to make a difficult concept saleable. In this he was joined in the script writing by none other than Oliver Stone, another maverick and conspiracy king, who later helped him with writing EVITA. (Yes, sort of like finding out that your macho gym teacher wears Victoria's Secret.)Scattered throughout are some great performances by Randy Quaid and John Hurt (already looking sixty at the ripe old age of 38) but the star performance is by Brad Davis as Billy Hayes; a tortured, realistic performance. He went on to be one of the first and best known stars to die of AIDS. Truth be told, Midnight Express was his greatest role and the one he will be remembered for.Even though it was made in the late 70's it is a pretty timeless piece, give or take a polyester suit, which is the way those prisons are.The brutality exhibited would make a dominatrix squeal.",Midnight Express

Straight ahead, to be honest: This movie is waste of time and beside that, it twists the truth. People might say, that it is just entertainment, but this movie comes up with the ambition to show the world, how brutally corruption in mid-east countries exist.The problem of the whole storytelling is the one-sided point of view. I'm telling this, because you can't approach seriousness and afterwards when the audience, i think especially the Turkish, is getting angry at your spoiling work, turn around and save your butt by telling, hey it's just entertainment. This is cheap recreancy.The movie itself is driven by known feeling-games, portraying ""bad-good"" skirmish without any draft to endorse the story. After some certain point it's getting boring and annoying, since there is too little atmosphere in the movie, and that leaves a cheesy aftertaste.It's a pity, why Olive Stone didn't go deeper into the characters, because then the audience have had some knots to cling to some interesting aspects. So in the end, Oliver Stone fails and produces a bunch of crap, sorted by a bad story.rawkid i'm the audience, i decide.",Midnight Express
127,jennys-saviour,"Well scripted, but ultimately misses the mark.",6,26 October 2000,"""Midnight Express"" is an incredibly famous movie. Everyone I know has either seen it or mentioned it at one time or another. It also has a big reputation as being one of the harshest prison movies ever. So after many years of hearing about it I decided to hire it out. The beginning is a great sequence is suspense and expectations. However the ordeal the main character goes through after this is greatly hampered by a few factors. ""Warning Spoilers Ahead"" 1.The main character chose to smuggle the drugs of his own accord for no apparent reason (e.g His family didnt seem to greatly need any money neither did he given how supportive his dad is throughout) 2.The Main character seems mostly unrepentant of his actions throughout the whole film (At one point giving a speech in which he expresses his hatred of the whole of Turkey) 3.Although the prison sequences are tough alot of the worst things happen to other characters. Except for the very end where things then start to fall down on him. The saving graces of this movie are the performances of John Hurt and Brad Davis and the great Opening and closing sequences which really come to the heart of the story. Other than that the rest of the film is too lopsided and too many scenes miss their mark for this film to have the impact the makers of it obviously desired for it to have.All up not the classic its billed as.",Midnight Express

Billie Hayes was not treated that badly, and admitted it, many years later.This is a man who smuggled drugs into Turkey, was caught, sentenced according to their laws, and then escaped.

After they won the Academy Award, the Cohen Brothers admitted this was a lie, and the story was fiction. But the movie was so darn cute the audience forgave them. Would they have forgiven them had they known the truth at the time? Would the audience have forgiven Billie Hayes for his stretching (breaking) of the truth in this film had they known it as the time? As a work of drama, it's effective.

Nonetheless, they, along with the vast majority of their countrymen who deal with harsh authoritarianism and humiliation day in and day out, can at least be thankful that this film played an undeniably enormous role in keeping Turkey from becoming a major destination for druggie tourism a la Holland, Goa, Nepal, etc. Alan Parker did them no small favour in this respect...

The prison guards are cruel,they use primitive torturing methods and of course the famous rape...I agree with the movie-maker that the country was a backward place, corrupt prison guards, torturing, political unrest, drug trafficking, etc.Those who feel offended should do some self-evaluation and work towards improving Turkey's human rights conditions instead of bashing a movie and denying historic facts such as the Armenian Genocide and the occupation of Cyprus and persecution of the kurds, and the torturing of prisoners.Reality hurts, a movie will not make a difference except for mirroring a certain situation in an artistic, ""hollywoodean"" way.I give this movie 7 out of 10.",Midnight Express

The thing which amazed me most it the plot  the film is about an American, which went to another country, broke the laws of that country, got himself caught, received a severe punishment as a result of US pressure on Turkey to fight drug trafficking.  While serving his sentence he breaks many rules, customs and regulations, tries to escape, gets caught again and finally escapes killing in the process a law enforcement officer.  And he is a HERO  the director skillfully employs every trick in the book to make us feel for the guy and rejoice at the ending.

If only Oliver Stone wrote his own screenplay instead of adapting Hayes' book. If only the film was more complimentary towards Turkey.If only.Midnight Express is a flawed masterpiece. It has excellent, engaging performances; sensitive, tense direction - and an amazing score.That said, the film has problems.One is minor. At the end, the film begins to kinda drag and the scenes in the loony bin make absolutely no sense. But that's kinda the point of a loony bin.The other is quite major. The film's absolute refusal to heed to Hayes' book and its quite negative treatment of Turkish people has understandably drawn a huge amount of ire. As good as this film is, it's utter, utter bullshit. That scene where he condemns Turkey was a well-written and well-acted scene, but it does not belong in this film. It would have been better served in a fictional film, a film where there'd be little repercussions to insulting an entire nation of people.That said, I enjoyed this film very much.

146,zlarvixen,Powerful and inspiring film,9,20 April 2020,"A very old motion picture indeed, this movie kept my attention precisely because it was so realistic.There was definitely an air of self-righteousness on the part of the protagonist, as he did commit a crime in a foreign country after all. Regardless, a life sentence for an amount of hashish so small seemed quite absurd to me at the time. The antagonist who tormented him throughout the movie was also very well played out and did a terrific job of instilling the reality of depraved individuals in these sorts of occupations.It was shot in a very graceful style, and the interaction between the different characters really had a unique tone to the whole atmosphere. The slow but certain degeneration of Hayes' character as a whole really shows what takes a toll on humanity once they are secluded to a place where they are subject to no freedom in any aspect of their lives.On an additional note, in contrast to what most skeptics might say, in my opinion the portrayal of Turkish people in this movie was spot on. They are not a moral nor graceful people by any means, and thus should not be displayed as such. From the atrocities of the Ottoman Empire to the Armenian genocide, there is little sympathy to be had with Turkish history, especially from a Western and Christian perspective.Midnight Express was nothing other than a film with enough courage to expose the Turkish nation for what it truly is, and how UN-European its people and culture truly are.

149,cem92003,"Grossly exaggerated, pathetically idiotic.",2,20 May 2007,"The film is based on the true story of a drug smuggler named Bill Hayes who was jailed in a Turkish prison. While I was studying in Europe in 1982, many people I had met had mentioned this movie upon understanding that I was Turkish. Almost 10 years later, I was able to see it on a private Turkish channel ironically. I will not dwell on demonizing an entire nation issue but would like move on to some serious flaws in the film. First, if the language spoken is Turkish, then I must have been taught Sanskrit or Urdu as my native language. Hardly any native speaker can understand a word that guardians and the police speak here. Second, when delivering the verdict, the judges in Turkey never say ""Gecmis Olsun"" (let it be passed),which is a word of consolation spoken only to people who are either recovering from an illness or who may have had an accident. Moreover, the prison looks more like a demolished Spanish hacienda rather than a prison. As for the homosexuality issue blamed on Turkish people, hardly have I seen an American prison movie without scenes of either homosexuality or homosexual rape. Examples are plentiful: The ""Shawshanks Redemption"", ""American History X"", ""The Glass House"", ""The Butterfly Effect"" etc.. The director and/or the producer may have wanted to do some hate mongering, after all it is their right.

I have heard very wonderful things about Turkey and people I know who have traveled there loved the country and the people. Whether this young man is telling a completely truthful, objective story about his treatment in prison in Turkey or not, the point is that this movie is a work of art, and a GREAT WORK OF ART. The acting is awesome, as are the sets, the costumes, dialogue, photography and the action.Nobody is defending drug smuggling here, the movie is showing how unfairly this particular young man was treated because the punishment he received far outweighed his crime. And the focus is on this young man's struggle to stay sane, deal with his loneliness, sexual desires, and fears. Brad Davis is perfectly cast in this role. The focus is also on other prisoners and their struggles. The character played by John Hurt is particularly compelling and pathetic, and Hurt's acting is top notch.I highly recommend this film.

People have criticized this movie for its racist portrayal of Turks. However one should remember that this is a PRISON MOVIE-hence the likes of Hamidou and Rifki portray prison life at its worst.  Most other Turks, eg. airport officials, and other prison guards are simply INDIFFERENT as opposed to sadistic, as you would generally expected. It was also criticized for its exaggeration/falsification of certain events. Perhaps. But once again this is a MOVIE, hence the dramatic impact necessary in order to carry the story. The real Billy Hayes had actually admitted to screenwriter, Oliver Stone, that even though he never gave that ""Turks are pigs"" speech in real life, he nevertheless FELT EXTREMELY UPSET upon receiving 30 years,& hence reflects his true emotions at the time. Overall a must see movie, that will leave you thrilled as well as portray the concept of miscarriage of justice. Incidentally, the recent complaints by Amnesty International on the alleged continued use of brutality and torture in Turkish prisons, reflects how the movie wasn't made for nothing.

153,karakurtf,And here I thought Turkish people were xenophobic,4,30 August 2018,"Midnight Express was actually a pretty big issue in Turkey around my childhood. It was accepted as a successful but misguided movie by Turkish critics. And the message it delivers was a thorn on the society to a degree. It was banned for a long time and I believe I've had a chance to watch the movie on television around 92-92. Watching it again in 2018 made me question a lot of the views I've had as a child. Just take me as a neutral viewer since I've tried so hard to stay that way throughout the movie (and believe me it was difficult). The movie begins slowly, and makes it pretty clear that the only logical and dignified/civilised people that Bill can interact are the other foreigners at the jail. Any Turkish person they come in contact either prisoner or guard or prosecutor etc. etc. Do not have a speck of dignity. I am not talking about evil, or dangerous, Just flat out degenerates. And this one sided aprroach doe not show any indication of change throughout the movie. He might as well have been sent to jail in Mars and you would not know the difference. The character that we are expected to sympathise with follows the rules right up until the point when he cannot anymore and flat out demolishes a whole nation with a tirade so undercooked, you eyeballs would roll up back to your brain. The cinematography is hellish but the pace is so dull that you would force yourself to stay awake at certain intervals. The acting is surprisingly over the top and distracting that one cannot emphasize or understand the characters' state of mind. And the movie just ends abruptly without any logical build up whatsoever. So all in all, yes this movie can be divisive but at the same time one should consider if the movie has the quality to be discussed so intensely? Does it deserve attention on such magnitude or does it simply feed on the phobias of the western nations on foreign cultures and tells a pathetic story just for the sake of being disturbing?",Midnight Express

The film was touching but was not very intense, and it should have been since it took place in a Turkish prison. In fact, I thought the prison wasn't bad at all. Not imprisoned in cells but something life a living apartment. The director or writer should have used more details to really give a feel for what the problems were at the prison because I wasn't bothered by the setting. The main character mentioned be lonely or something like that but that didn't seen effective either in communicating the feel of the prison. Only did the conditions seem radical later in the film when he is transfered. But up till that point it wasting striking me as a horrible experience. Other criticisms are the abrupt homosexual sequence and the 70's soundtrack. The story moved along well but the suddenness of the homosexual encounter was too abrupt and could have been built up better by the writer. Also, the music had it's strong moments but was also distracting sometimes because of the distinct outdated 70's tunes. But I wont say much about that because the 70's were awesome and it was a 70's movie. Too bad all the 70's songs don't last.

That people shows respect their great leader by put his picture on every toilets wall. This is what movie told us. And I will tell the truth.In 1970's Turkish people demanded some democratic rights by actions. Like every growing country, 68's were energetic and full of ideas for their country. They wanted a liberated country of law. They weren't use drugs for peace, peace must have to be earn! In the same time, there were CIA agents too. They trained some bad people (we know them as counter guerillas) for torture to that young and hopefully people. Many prisons fulled with thinking prison. This movie is very weak to show suffer that people had. In addition there weren't any American citizen, only Turkish mind prisons and American torturers. I know Alan Parker and Oliver Stone are both left minded cinema makers. But obviously they didn't care their friends in this movie except Greek and Armenian lobby in USA. I don't tell this movie is lying, but doesn't tell anything about truth either. The real truth is Oliver Stone came to Istanbul after made his movie 'Troy' and danced in all night clubs, ate dinners in some elegant restaurants and had a boat trip with beautiful womens.

The only downside is, for the sake of awards and ""art"", a culture was demonized beyond redemption and any limits over a fictional story (Oliver Stone himself wrote the story for the movie). *The following is not a spoiler from the movie but points out an event from the plot* In reality, William Hayes it turns out, was arrested at the Turkish airport for trying to smuggle packs of drugs attached on his body into the U.S., and he was held for a time before being given to the American authorities for deportation. William Hayes and Oliver Stone themselves it turns out, have already apologized to the Turkish people for the overly dramatized and fictional parts of the movie and the book. It's funny actually how a movie can create so much on a true moment in life to a point of fiction and still call it a true story. The Turks don't get any breaks in the movie. All their people, cops, judges, lawyers and inmates are shown in such extreme way as ugly, merciless, demonic and sadistic people that one who knows nothing about Turkey would think that its population consists of demons and ugly merciless sadists. Actually this can be compared to movies which have been made about the Russians in the past which always seem to show the Russian women as ugly people with facial hair and nothing attractive while in reality, Beautiful Russian women dominated the modeling business in the world. While apologies have been made, the damage has already been done on the image of the Turkish people. People who are anti-Turkish love praising this movie and insisting that it's a true story all the way while the Turks keep getting rightfully offended. Be aware however, that %80 or some more of this movie is purely fictional. Even just logic would tell you that at a time where the U.S. and Turkey had such strong relations during the cold war, something like what is shown in the movie would have been unthinkable by the Turkish authorities. For a person who just wants to watch a good thriller movie and doesn't care nor wants to get involved in any dramatic flame wars or political discussions on this board or any other, it's worth watching at least once. If you don't like the movie, at least you'll see what all this fuss has been about over the years since the movie was shown in the theaters.Keep the pop-corns popping' and the good movies rolling' :D",Midnight Express

Who goes to a movie theatre in search of 'the truth'?   This movie was made in the seventies, but the political situations have changed since then, and so has the general American xenophobia. I don't think any American viewer nowadays would go see this movie and then be lead to think all Turkish people are pigs.  Loneliness and suffering of the human soul and body can have any other setting, either realistic (Nazi concentration camp) or fictional (King Lear's palace).  I have never seen in cinema a more realistic and honest--almost to the point of crudeness at times--portrait of a tortured human being and his anguished, desperate struggles against a sick, twisted, perverse world--any imaginary or real one.   The performance of the entire cast (especially the Turkish characters) is impeccable.  John Hurt is cut out for the character.  The only flaw of the movie is the surprise ending, a classic deus ex machina; so are the black and white family reunion pictures which struck me as mush.",Midnight Express

Turkish denial is legendary especially to those who do research into the Armenian Genocide where the Turks systematically murdered millions of Armenians and others on a scale never before seen by man.The bad news though is Oliver Stone has gone on to make subsequent movies that were fictitious made to look like fact. Two prime examples include JFK and the more recent Alexander. However it is very important to note that Midnight Express is an accurate account of Turkish culture. In fact, Midnight Express was made well before Stone learned that controversy generates income. Midnight Express wasn't even meant to be controversial but the standard issue Turkish denial made it so. This could be a good thing in the long run since more and more people are starting to realize the crimes against humanity and start to ignore the denial.",Midnight Express

Pretty much the whole time my attention was engulfed by the film's story. The sound design used to intensify scenes was a brilliant idea and the cinematography was great. Not to mention the acting from Randy Quaid was surprising, I guess he was good in his early years.The only bad thing I have to say about the movie is that the audience is dealing with a character, Billy, who did commit a crime, which can make it hard to root for him. So when the court changes his sentence after serving three years it almost feels like that is the director's only way in getting the audience to feel for the character. There was also a quick scene of homosexuality, which I thought the film could have done without, especially since the other character wasn't even one of Billy's close friends. Other than that it was a very engrossing movie from start to end.I just have to mention that there are two intense scenes that come out of nowhere and surprise you (trust me, you'll know them when you see them).",Midnight Express

There is no doubt Turkey was shown barbaric; in this movie, Turkish people characterised as foolish and cruel. Actually both Alan Parker and Oliver Stone agreed that the movie criticised Turkish people unfairly. Anyway I can confirm that the movie is one of the best prison- themed movie I have ever seen. Especially ''Paolo Bonacelli"" acts terrific as ""Rifki."" His fluent Turkish inspired me a lot despite his Italian citizenship. Also the Turkish folk themes which were sung by Asik Reyhani who is the father of the Turkish lament content songs were extraordinary.

Midnight Express-1978-Directed by Alan Parker-Starring Brad Davis and the legendary John Hurt-Screenplay by the great Oliver Stone. This film is a 9/10. The film is based on the real story of a man called Billy Hayes who was imprisoned for trying to smuggle hash out of Turkey. The film really struck me on the harsh reality and how much grit was projected. The film is really a bleak reality filled with horror and violence with sadistic humans which creates true terror of a horrible place with true grit and real terror. The film is sickening and in places and saddening in others. I'm not sure what to do. From a sweaty, enclosed prison to a horrifying mental asylum where the talk of 'machines' rules and the slow demise of Billy as he discovers his meaning and sexuality and the power of his mentality is sometimes heartbreaking as he plans his escape to normality.""if I stay here I'm going to die!""",Midnight Express

Billy's Lawyer, his dad, the Turkish judges, the trustee, the sadistic guard, etc. It bothers me that the truth of the real story was distorted. Oliver Stone wrote the script, and I heard him say that sometimes things need to be changed for dramatic purposes. I believe him, but I also think it's used to convey a personal point-of-view.

If you like this movie, watch ""Kurtlar Vadisi"" and see that aggression comes back to the aggressor. By the way I must mention that a Turkish jail is not worse than an American jail where prison rape is everyday's business.

He is beaten and degraded, he witnesses the beating of children, and it's a bad scene all around. Most of the other prisoners are Turks.  Turkish is spoken, and is shown without subtitles. This is great.  It puts the movie viewer in the shoes of the main character, who doesn't know Turkish either.The main character, William, pals up with two other guys, a bombastic American played by Randy Quaid, and a timid bespectacled Englishman named Max (played well by John Hurt).  Randy Quaid's character is so over-the-top as to be annoying.  He's also so unbelievable as to almost have ruined the movie for me.  The last 1/3 of the movie is better than the rest, I think.I won't ruin the ending for you by telling you what happens.Suffice it to say that this is a rough movie about an American imprisoned in Turkey.  The style of moviemaking itself is very sentimental and emotional. The music is a bit over the top also.  The music could have been more subtle and a bit lighter, rather than pounding the viewer.Fans of prison movies should definitely see this.

This movie is so genius and powerful that it can't be fully understood by trying to rationalize it. Many think the movie is racist or not based on real facts. What these people fail to realize is that IT DOES NOT MATTER. The movie is about something so big and fundamental that it can't be judged according to the criteria used for some stupid 'good guys - bad guys' Hollywood nonsense. This is about the eternal evil of human nature which does not fit our definitions of 'good' and 'bad'. While smuggling drugs may be 'bad' and illegal, Billy Hayes had to deal with the evil so enormous that it made him a saint. This kind of evil can be encountered anywhere if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is not about 'bad' Turks and 'good' Americans: the events of the last decade clearly demonstrated that Americans can be as evil as anyone else.

They all seem to be the same, do a crime, go to prison and then escape. Midnight Express is no exception to this.The film is based on the true story of Billy Hayes who was sent to prison in Turkey for trying to smuggle drugs back to America. Billy gets caught at the airport and taken to prison, the story is very predictable from there, you seem to no what's going to happen next which takes all sense of mystery and suspense out of the film. Billy suffers four years inside the torturous prison and is about to be released when his parole is denied. Billy gets angry and with persuasion from his other inmates he decides to catch the 'MIDNIGHT EXPRESS' (prison code for escape.)Further on in the film after Billy's failure to escape he is sent to another prison for the criminally insane, from there he goes on to escape. For me the film ended rather suddenly and I felt very unfulfilled and disappointed. Its a nice movie to watch but in the end its 'just another prison movie' and when watching it don't be expecting anything different.

Where you hate it or love it but the message is given across. Well, I believe it has great acting and good cinematography. It stimulates discussion, and intellectual of the type. I seriously want to see it now that I have read the comments.The plot line is Billy while trying to smuggle hashish out of Turkey gets caught and falls to Turkish prison and is abused in the latter. The demonization of Turkish prison and in turn its people are part of the clear cut Hollywood style. If I have seen this film I obviously wouldn't want to go to Turkey but I am from Turkey. So in that case I don't think I have much choice. I don't think I will have a nationalistic reaction to the film if I see it. Because it is a film and entertainment and should be considered in that framework. The odds are that something similar to this happened and that it is hard not to feel sorry for the person who has gone through all this trouble for smuggling drugs.

It is like me going to U.S. and not paying my taxes and getting penalized in turn and getting, feeling sorry for myself and angry at the law enforcement officers and don't understand why they punish me so dearly.

193,eaglerock,My all time favourite movie,10,30 September 2006,"This is an unsurpassed cinematographic achievement that leaves you breathless. The lead actor did his job extremely well and the others were very convincing as well. The music by Giorgio Moroder is definitely a classic from 1970s.The director (Alan Parker) and screenplay writer (Oliver Stone) slowly but surely paint the gloomy picture of unimaginable atrocities and horrors one can expect in a Turkish prison. As the movie proceeds you can almost physically feel what the personal hell of Billy Hayes really felt like. The direction and storytelling are masterful, and you are instantly immersed into this twilight zone of brutality which normal people can hardly understand, let alone condone. Some say it was OK to punish him because he was smuggling drugs. What? This type of reasoning and justification never ceases to amaze me. That's completely besides the point. The point is that a man was treated with unimaginable brutality, while his ""crime"" was obviously used just as a pretence. Oliver Stone doesn't want to waste his time on those who cannot understand such a basic thing, that the punishment in sick societies often has nothing to do with the ""crime"".Unforgettable moments in the movie? There are so many, but if I had to choose, I'd single out all the scenes with the main prison bully, Hamidou, and when Billy walks in circles with the other prisoners like a lunatic, realizing he would go completely mad if he stayed there any longer. The moment when Billy gives his speech before the Turkish judge, is heart wrenching to say the least and represents the climax of the movie. I first saw this film in 1993 on a local TV station, and although I realized immediately that the movie was crafted very well, I thought to myself: ""oh, it can't be that bad in Turkey. They must have exaggerated things a lot"". I was wrong. I was still young and naive and believed that people are generally pleasant everywhere. NOT! I went to Turkey on a holiday, and albeit I didn't have any problems with their law, many of their hotels are like portals to Hell and much like the prison from this film - they are totally ridden with the nastiest toxic black MOULD, horrible food and often extremely rude Turks. My health was permanently damaged and I still suffer the consequences. Some of my friends had similar experience this year, after visiting Turkey. I guess not everywhere in turkey is so bad, but some places and people are definitely Hellish! I will NEVER go there again and I would not wish my worst enemy what I had to go through in Turkey.In this age of sickening political correctness it is absolutely refreshing to watch a film like this one, a film that doesn't mind throwing the blunt truth right before your eyes, no matter how it might seem to any arrogant nationalist offended by the perfectly candid review of the repressive policies and practices, or by the representation of the repulsive dangers that can befall anyone who is unfortunate enough to experience the dark side of this country.And for those Turks who are offended by this movie, I have to say only this: Why oh why don't you at least wash your hotels and remove the toxic mold that makes susceptible people extremely sick (but isn't pleasant for anyone for that matter). The toxic mold which some of your hotels are infested with can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting and even permanent neurological brain damage when touched or inhaled. People want to travel, not to become poisoned for life, you know? Why don't you serve food that won't make people sick? (if you didn't know, flies aren't good food for humans.) Why don't you treat holiday makers with some respect? Of course, there are good Turks, I'm not generalizing, but the number of rude, dirty and impolite ones, which for some strange reason were put in charge in many Turkish holiday resorts, is just mind-boggling.Kudos to Oliver Stone for not giving a damn what some might think about his beliefs and work. And for all of you who think this movie is biased or exaggerated - just go to tripadvisor dot com and do a search for ""turkey and dirty"". You'll be amazed with the number of reviews from various people that confirm exactly what I experienced. Why is this so, and why is it tolerated is beyond me. I guess people will go anywhere even if they get sick or get harassed by the locals, as long as it is cheap. Geez.",Midnight Express

Movie is based on a real life event, but the story is far from being accurate.It also happens in some gangster movies, you can feel pity for a guy who is actually doing things wrong, like Godfather, or like the protagonist of Midnight Express, who is a drug smuggler, who is caught by the Turkish authorities while intentionally carrying a great deal of illegal substance.Now, please show some emphaty, imagine an alien guy from a country that you don't like, say Turkey, coming to your country and committing a crime which requires punishment with prison. Do you really care about him? I watched the movie and I could not find it realistic, every Turkish guy seems to be disgusting, unworthy of living.

There is no justice only bribes and bribing. It was so good to watch the movie to get the opinion finally canalized. If Hayes are a bad, spoiled brat, that committed a crime, doesn't really matter.

199,manudave,Superb performances by Davis and Hurt make this a must see,10,2 July 2001,A harrowing movie that I saw over a dozen times as a teenager when it was first released. Saw it last week for the first time in 15 years and it still moves me. John Hurt is one of may favorite actors and he plays Max superbly. He is a character we sympathize with from the first time we see him. Brad Davis was a relative newcomer and it was certainly his first lead role. He was brilliant as Billy Hayes. Sadly his career seemed to stall after this until his untimely death in 1991 from AIDS. He never hit the same heights but what heights he hits in this film. Such a shame he self-destructed with drugs alcohol and promiscuous sex. The film is graphic - do not rent this if you are squeamish. The violence is a little over the top but the director obviously wanted a film that would shock. And what we end up with is a lot of scenes that make you want to turn away.,Midnight Express
200,egozalan,Comments,5,1 April 2006,Hello I'm from turkey.I was born and raised in Turkey I have watched the midnight express film. I have some comments for it.-the real story and film are different.Accorning to real story.There was a man who dealt with drugs comes to turkey and buys a high amount of hasis and earns extremely much money by selling it .But police chatchs him and Turkish government gives him 20 years prison sentence .Then a mafia in turkey takes him to U.S again .When he has reached to U.S .He wants his money which he had earned by selling hasis from Turkish government .Turkish government rejects this and he treats Turkish government by making a film about this subject.And they do .They really exaggerated this story in the film they wanted to prevent people to come to turkey and buy hasis .In those years Turkish people were producing hasis only to make hasis breed.-Who is the behind of this film.Armenians. All actors are Armenian in the film and they are speaking in Turkish with their Armenian accent.Why Armenians tiring to do something else like that.Because they want to make propaganda against turkey.FOr example Armenian discrimination is a part of the propaganda.Its totally lie like this film.BUT !!!! Unfortunately!!! In those years there was torture in the Turkish prisons.Even today in the 2006 physical and psychological torture is being made in the Turkish prisons.This is the shame of the Turkish society. I have never been to a prison thank god.I say this torture comment as I read from news papers.,Midnight Express

It might not be exactly like what happened to the real Billy Hayes but i'm sure it's close. The Turks is not very nice people but they're trying to clean up their act so they're allowed to join EU.

203,adembilmem,Worst movie ever..,1,5 January 2007,"This movie is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen, in my whole life. It is ignorant, racist and perverted. It can be compared with Nazi propaganda films from the 30s and 40s. Allthoug the real Billy Hayes girlfriend made lots of Turkish friends in Turkey who helped and comforted her, the film shows not one compassionate Turk. The Turks in the movie are portrayed as sadist, dumb,greedy and evil. And to some facts: The real Billy Hayes admitted in 1998 that the film is highly over exaggerated comparing with his own real experiences, in the Istanbul Prison 1970-1975. And he also admitted that the movie could be evaluated to be almost a fictional story. Make also notice of these facts: The guard Hamidou, who is probably the most sadist person in the movie,""Paul L. Smith"", is in fact an Armenian,his real name is Anam Edel. Likewise, the prosecutor, an Armenian, named Kevork Malikyan. Those who is not ignorant, knows that most Armenians hate Turks. Off course not all, but most of them. I also believe that 80 % of the positive comments written on this site, about the film, is written by Armenians.10 % by Greeks and 10 % by ignorants.In the film, an Englishman, is jailed for stealing some candles from a Mosque! Muslims do not keep candles in any mosques, at all! The Turkish inmates also play baseball in the prison yard. Baseball arrived to Turkey in the mid 90s. Brad Davis admitted shortly before his death in 1991, that he had an heavy drug abuse while filming the movie. This is another proof that only a junkie could play the head role in such a film. Davis died of AIDS at the age of 41. My final conclusion: This film is probably one of the most dangerous movies produced ever, and has damaged the reputation of Turkey, and the Turkish people, more than anybody can think of. There is no such thing, as a good people or a bad people. There is only such thing as good or bad persons. Exampel: one ""Turkish"" prisoner ""Rifki"" (italian actor, there was no Turkish actors in the film, likewise there was no good Turks in the film) murders a Cat, and hates Cats... Well I am of Turkish heritage, and I love Cats, and have had several as pets. Like millions of other Turks have had Cats as pets. My only hope for the future, is that people in the western world, would get more intelligent,in time, so they can see that, they should not build their information about Turkey and its people, just on this sick propaganda film.",Midnight Express

This film's depiction of Turks is one sided to the extent of being racist. To the extent that one thinks it was not a coincidence and was financed by a lobby that had an agenda.It may have been understandable if it was only the prison guards and policeman, and the soldiers etc, who were represented as pigs. OK, in that case we see the world from the eyes of the individual who is quashed by the legal system and enforcement of a state for a petty crime of smuggling some weed... It would be OK if the target here was the ""State"".However in this movie any Turk is a bad guy, filthy guy, a rapist, a liar ...How could any audience find this believable?

The teacher never checked the book for content, so I read it anyways. I must say as 12 year old this was definitely ""heavy reading"". However, this book really opened my eyes to a lot more than I was ever exposed to. I didn't even know what ""hash"" was at the time, I had to ask my Mom what it meant. And she was the one who bought the book at a garage sale. She of course never intervened with my reading either. Of course the book was very descriptive, but mind you as a 12 year old reading this, I couldn't quite paint the same picture as and adult reading it. After a couple years, I finally managed to rent the movie and see the pictorial representation. It definitely helped me understand a lot more, but also made the movie easier to follow after reading the book.My personal opinions on drug usage and sales are not for it at all. However, this story has made me understand a more universal truth, which is that ""we all make mistakes....some bigger than others"" I don't condone what Billy Hayes did, but then again what he had to endure surely wasn't commensurate with his crime. Yes, I know it was smuggling drugs out of a country, but being that I live in a more civilized nation (and I'm sure Turkey has changed also), I can't fathom the torture and mental damage it must have caused. Perhaps the movie may be a little of a stretch, but nonetheless I'm sure it was not a pleasant stay by any means. Had I not read this book and seen the movie, I think my outlook on life would not grant as much mercy and sympathy for unfortunate circumstances. I think this is a value we all need to feel and pass on to others to make our society a little less tense. I'm not saying let hardened criminals off easy, but I think some people deserve that second chance to right their wrongs and make better of themselves and society.If you have not read the book or seen the movie, I highly recommend doing one or the other, if not both.

The dark portrayal of Turks in the film isn't to say to us, ""hate the Turks,"" it's more about conveying that sense of homesickness and culture shock. If you watched this movie and were afraid of the Turks or felt hostile towards them, then you're probably the type who refused to swim in waters after Jaws came out. Basically you were an idiot, and this movie shouldn't have been made differently to accommodate you bastards. This piece of film is excellent, and is probably my favorite.By the way - they do show some Turks in a positive light if I'm not mistaken....isn't a lawyer sympathetic and hoping to help Hayes? Or one of the first Turkish interrogators who tells Billly he ""shouldn't"" be afraid?

I just want to tell that I really do not understand how Rıfkı is the most hated character in the movie, the plot goes like this (no spoiler though, it's not very important) First they burn Rıfkı's money for no good reason, and when Rıfkı tries to get his revenge by simply blaming one of them with smuggling, the HERO beats the hell out of Rıfkı and even though Rıfkı doesn't come back at him he goes after Rıfkı and rip his tongue off with HIS TEETH! That is how one pictures the Turks bad, right?Sincerely, I don't see where the exaggeration is. I mean, I know torture isn't very humanistic but it is everywhere, apart from the cultural mistakes in the plot, it seems very realistic to me. But I don't see how beating one's feet is so extreme that everyone starts hating Turks.

All this would not be possible without an incredible story (and also real)to tell. The management is simply spectacular and despite the fact that the story is very modified to the original of William Hayes, this film is very faithful to the feeling of closure, emotional punishment and the loss of life even when our protagonist (Brad Davis)keep breathing.

The Midnight Express passed in 1978 and has left a mark on my life and on everyone who has seen this masterpiece film.",Midnight Express

Worst of all Turks in the film, dirt, shown as dishonest. If you come to Turkey will understand it better. Because the Turkish people, tolerant, hospitable, and good people. Moreover, films taken in Malta. In the event that the film not interesting at all Turks and Turkish dialog is spoken almost none of the alleged conversation was not a proper Turkish. Moreover, more distorted and exaggerated events, author Billy Hayes said.Alan Parker and Oliver Stone's really a shame.

225,erkanca,Oliver Stone sorry for Midnight Express,2,23 January 2012,"The Hollywood writer and director Oliver Stone has apologized for offending Turkey with his Oscar-winning film Midnight Express, which featured powerful images of appalling prison conditions and brutality that have haunted the country for decades. Visiting Turkey for the first time since the movie was released in 1978, Stone admitted ""over-dramatising"" the screenplay, which he wrote. It was one of his early forays into cinematography for a film that was directed by Alan Parker.The script, which won Stone an Oscar in 1979, was based exclusively on interviews with Billy Hayes, the American sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling drugs into Turkey.In the film, Mr Hayes, who was played by the actor Brad Davis, eventually escapes.""It's true I over-dramatised the script,"" Stone told reporters in Istanbul before holding talks with Turkey's culture and tourism minister, Erkan Mumcu. ""But the reality of Turkish prisons at the time was also referred to ... by various human rights associations.""Stone said he had been fearful of visiting Turkey for a long time because of the effect the hard-hitting movie had had on the country. ""For years, I heard that Turkish people were angry with me and I didn't feel safe there,"" he told the mass selling Millyet daily.""The culture ministry gave me a guarantee that I would be safe, so I feel comfortable now,"" said the American, who went on to direct Born on the 4th of July, Platoon, Evita and, most recently, Alexander.Echoing the view of diplomats who said that, if anything, foreigners were often treated better than locals in Turkish jails, Stone said that the country had improved greatly since 1974, when a brief visit to Istanbul had given him the impression of being in a ""very Ottoman"" place.In Ankara yesterday, Stone's remarks were greeted with relief. Turks have long accused the film of exacerbating racist attitudes towards their country.Many expressed horror and hurt at the way the prison drama had formulated views of Turkey, despite the evident progress it had made on human rights in recent years.""It was an awful movie and very humiliating, especially if you were a Turk living abroad,"" said Harvard graduate Banu Revan.""Whenever you said you were from Turkey, Americans would automatically say, 'Oh yes, I've seen Midnight Express. Isn't that the place where they cut the hands off people who are caught stealing?' as if we lived in Saudi Arabia! It was ridiculous.""Stone's apology came with just days to go before the EU's crucial decision on whether to launch membership talks with Ankara.",Midnight Express

But I want to criticize about the ideology that it has. Let's think about a nation. Do you think we are so bad like they said? Or we were? It was not criticizing just our justice system. They were swearing at our people actually with using films. It has been 26 years since the film published. And some people who watches that film still don't want to come to our country. The subject you are imposed by is a total crap. I mean you are convinced by what you saw. Turks are bad. Why? How can you comment on a guy without knowing him? In conclude I recommend you that please don't believe what they said, research for yourself. And believe in what you want to believe than. Apart from that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it as a film fan. It is an absorbing film. But as a human being it is a ridiculous film.",Midnight Express

There is no Turkish people playing in the movie. Even you can not understand what they are saying although I am Turkish. I wish such an outstanding directors would focus on the bad system that resulted in a bad experience in Turkey like in many countries so that everyone would have gained a lesson;instead he(Stone) preferred to reflect Turks as bad, non-human and dirty. Even Bill Hayes told that ""I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.' ... I wish they'd shown some of the milk of human kindness I (also) witnessed.""

229,atikx,it is exaggerated,1,21 November 2006,"The actor was very successful. But, since I visited Turkey many times, there was no parallelism between the scenes of the film and Turkey. For example the accent of Turkish people in the film was not actual Turkish. The accent belonged to Greek actors who tried to speak Turkish. Also no people in Turkey was wearing fess and they do not wear Arabic clothes. Because they are not Arabic. There are no prison in Istanbul like the one was shown in the film. Homosexuality can not be accepted by Turkish people. The homosexuals are isolated from the public. As a result, the actors were successful, but the scenes do not represent Turkey and it is exaggerated.",Midnight Express

I don't think so,8,1 January 2005,"I've seen this movie quite a few times, since we were kids (seems like hundreds of years ago!), and have always enjoyed it, especially as a lot of it was made in Malta, where I'm from. Yes, that's the tiny island in the Mediterranean. I keep reading reviews about how the Turkish prison and people don't sound realistic enough, it's because most of the extras were Maltese, and are in fact speaking Maltese. The prison is a wartime fort, again, in Malta. It doesn't make much of a difference for English speaking people, as it all sounds the same, but as some Turkish people have pointed out, some of it doesn't sound Turkish. I hope this doesn't spoil anything for anyone, as it's still a great movie, sad yet still enjoyable.",Midnight Express

There is no good Turkish person in the movie. Not even single one. In WW2 movies you see German soldier gives a cigarettes to a prisoner or Jews or a Nazi officer do something nice for Jews. I mean i can understand that this is a prison movie and there is no good prison anywhere in the world. I am Turkish and this movie makes me think this movie was specially made to insult whole nation and influence the viewer and give them terrible opinion about Turkey which was not good in the first place. I rated 2 because i think the soundtrack is great.The rest awful.,Midnight Express
232,konradaden,Powerful Movie...reflecting 1970s Turkish prisons,8,7 January 2005,"This is a strong, realistic movie. It describes the situation in Turkish prisons in the turbulent 1970s. Some of the critiques here tried to be apologists by saying that in ""any country"" drug traffickers will be punished harshly such as USA or Holand..but come on guys, will you be raped by the prison guard in USA or Holland? Is that part of the ""punishment"" in USA? Therefore movie talks about a particular environment that existed in 1970s throughout 1990s. Those of you who defend Turkey by saying that they traveled (as tourists) to Istanbul (the modernized largest mega polis)in the 1990s and 2000s cannot judge objectively. First you should go to eastern turkey, south etc...to towns and villages, second you should visit public places, prisons, government agencies to see what the movie wanted to tell...and not lay down on some tourist resort and promote Turkey on this post. Then, this movie was made based on a 1970s story..and you comment in 2004 based on your recent visit to Istanbul!!!Second, why picturing the movie in Malta would be a problem for some of the critiques here? Aren't most of Hollywood movies that talk about Europe, Afghanistan, Cuba, Iraq, etc pictured elsewhere? Aren't historic movies like Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, Lawrence of Arabia and many many more movies were pictured in places like Morocco or Spain? Does that make a difference? In general its a good movie. It has a message...",Midnight Express

That's the problem about you, you don't understand the effect of your actions. An American movie is shown in cinemas worldwide, millions of people watch such a movie.But in contrast to some years ago, thanks to Mr. Bush and the terror he creates, people are more sceptic about anything American today.

The Turkish language, spoken in this movie is impossible to understand for a Turkish person. This, besides all evil characteristics of Turkish people, made me think that the director did not care how the movie would seem to the Turkish audience, which means that the movie is only about making other people think of Turkey in a certain way. On the other hand, even in the movies about Nazis you can find some good and hope in some minor group, but in this movie there's nothing even average, let alone good, attributed to a whole country.",Midnight Express

Don't take the junkies at the movie serious.Watch this as you watch Shawshank Redemption.This isn't and wasn't Turkey.I didn't even understand what those Turks(?) in the movie were saying. Ah yeah they were Armenians who tried to speak Turkish.Somethings may have happened 30 years ago in that prison but this is not different than what happened in Robert Redford's Brubaker.And what about the court scene in this one. ""You Turks don't eat pig but you are all pigs, your food suck, let me .... all your people women blah blah blah"" Nobody blamed American culture in prison movies. Nobody made any generalizations about any culture in any prison movie but this one. So, from a cultural standpoint this movie is nothing but a manipulation, provocation, scandal, illusion and a total lie.Mentioned earlier, watch this so-called true story as you watch Shawshank.

The movie seems to be made to please some specific group back in 70's, aiming to disrepute the Turkish but unfortunately, the outcome turns out to be a mirror on their own faces. The fate of nationalism is to make fool of ones's self.The comedy starts instantly. The entire ""Turkish"" characters in the movie seem to be leased from some cheap horror movie's set. This one is for Turkish speakers: Mr. Stone's ""Turkish"" characters all have a hilarious accent while trying to speak Turkish. Worth watching just to see this :))Everything is deliberately set up to make the guys look gross, but simply way too bad to be true. Actually it is hard to believe that you are watching a genuine Hollywood production. The script appears to be written to exhilarate the adolescent nationalist viewer only.

There was nobody to defend Turks in those years in US. Greek and Armenian lobbies took the advantage of this fact. Even in the 2005 Turkish children in the US are insulted by their friends because of this movie. I must say it is nothing but a waste of time. It is like Turkey is Mordor and the Turks are orcs.

All the Turkish people in the movie are portrayed as ugly evils.Some reviewers say that if you forget about the propaganda, it is a good movie. Other than the acting by the main character, i didn't see what makes this movie a good one. The screenplay is very simplistic and unrealistic. Simple good against simple bad.

Turks are known as very kind people and this movie portrays them all horrible. Even before in prison, you see all the men in Islamic skull caps and women with head scarfs. Turkey is not such a religious country, this is not realistic. Nor do the people even have good Turkish. The actors in this movie are Armenians, and it is filmed an old prison in Malta. In reality he was in a modern prison in Turkey. He even admits to the story being over-exaggerated and not portraying what he wanted. He wanted to show people to follow laws in other countries because once you leave America you do not have the same rights. This could happen in any country.
