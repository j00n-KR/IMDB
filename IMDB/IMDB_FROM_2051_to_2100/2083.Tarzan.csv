0,MartinHafer,okay....just okay,6,10 June 2007,"I think a major problem with me watching this film is that the character Tarzan has been done so many times that I frankly am pretty tired of him. He's been in 1001 films and at this point, what is there to add to the story that hasn't already been said? Generally, this movie seems to say ""nothing"". The addition of ""cool"" gorilla playmates wasn't enough to invigorate the series and as a result of such familiarity of the content, the film is just a very well-made time-passer. Sure, it's very good technically and my kids enjoyed it, but the film has very little lasting appeal. I've been to The Magic Kingdom dozens of times and apart from just after the film debuted, there is almost no reference to it--nothing. And I think this says a lot about this adequate film.",Tarzan
1,TheLittleSongbird,"The last great Disney, and that's a fact!",9,26 February 2009,"Tarzan is a very good film indeed, and is without doubt the last great Disney movie. It only has one flaw, that's it, and in comparison to Hercules (weakest Disney of the 90s)that's saying something. The animation is just gorgeous. I have been to Africa, and never have I seen the African Jungle look so beautiful. The songs, performed by Phil Collins mostly, are very pleasant, though I must confess, that I did get annoyed once when my sister played ""Two worlds"" at loud volume on the computer, for what felt like an eternity. The characters are great, Tarzan is a wonderfully charismatic lead. My favourite character was Jane, thanks to a brilliant characterisation from the underrated Minnie Driver. Terk and Tantor provide great comic relief, and the gorillas provide plenty of quite emotional scenes. The weakest character, was the aforementioned Clayton. Although Brian Blessed voiced him with enthusiasm, Clayton wasn't particularly likable. The main reason why I like this movie as much as I do, is the thoroughly human portrayals of the characters, and it was also the first time in a Disney since Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame when I cried at the very end of the movie. Who would, it's really emotional. Tarzan is a must-see for Disney fans. It's not perfect, but it's miles better than the trash out today. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Tarzan
2,SnoopyStyle,Beautiful animation of familiar story,7,5 January 2015,"A family is shipwrecked and stranded in the jungle. Sabor the leopard kills the parents and Kala the gorilla rescues the baby. Despite leader Kerchak's disapproval, Kala raises the baby naming him Tarzan. Brash gorilla Terk befriends him and they meet fearful elephant Tantor. When Sabor attacks, Tarzan saves Kerchak and the group with his spear. Professor Porter and his daughter Jane are studying the gorillas led by their hunter guide Clayton. Jane is chased by a pack of baboons and Tarzan rescues her. Tarzan becomes torn between the jungle and going with Jane to England.The animation is terrific and very energetic. Tarzan swinging in the trees is exciting. The traditional tale is a bit stale and I don't think the montage sequences are that compelling. The Phil Collins music may not be a great fit for a Disney kids movie. Nevertheless this is a good animated movie for the whole family. It has enough excitement and maintains the interest of the audience.",Tarzan
3,Hitchcoc,Very Nicely Done Version,9,31 December 2016,"Having seen almost every Tarzan film ever made, including the Elmo Lincoln one, I have to give Disney their due. This one catches the spirit and the story of the Tarzan epic. But what is the very best is the music. Phil Collins' songs and the animation that goes with it are quite remarkable. Tarzan is a kind-hearted brute who needs to get away from his connection to the apes so Jane will become his. Of course, there is the usual hunter, driven to destroy everything that can breathe. There is the struggle for Jane because of her connection to her previous life. As time goes by, there are adventures where the big guy has to face death in order to make his way to a status he didn't even know existed. The animals and the minor characters provide significant roles, so this works pretty well. There is one scene where Tarzan cruises through the trees like he's on a skateboard. I wish they would trash this kind of stuff, because putting a 1990's twist on it diminishes its effectiveness. Otherwise a really nice film.",Tarzan
4,jboothmillard,Tarzan,4,21 September 2005,"In the past there were many live-action films featuring the famous king of the jungle with his iconic ululating yell (call), created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Walt Disney Pictures brought us this first cartoon version telling the story of the ape man, from early beginnings to being the man. Basically the story begins in the 19th Century, an English couple and their infant son are swept onto a deserted jungle island after escaping a burning ship, the couple build themselves a home in the tree, and meanwhile female gorilla Kala (Glenn Close) is devastated to lose her own child after it was killed by rogue leopardess Sabor. One day though Kala hears the cries of the orphaned human baby, she takes the child and escapes an attack by Sabor, her mate Kerchak (Lance Henriksen) allows but disapproves her wanting to raise the child as her own, naming him Tarzan. As a young boy Tarzan (Home Alone 3's Alex D. Linz) does make friends with young female gorilla Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) and paranoid male elephant Tantor, but he finds himself unable to fit in with the gorilla pack, so he takes great efforts to improve himself. As a young man Tarzan (Ghost's Tony Goldwyn) kills Sabor during an attack, gaining the reluctant respect of Kerchak, but the pack's peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), his daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and their hunter- guide Clayton (Brian Blessed). Jane is separated from the group and ends up being chased by baboons, but Tarzan saves her, he examines her and recognises her as a human like him, and she leads them back to her father and Clayton, who take great interest in him, both as a scientific specimen and their link to finding the gorillas, Tarzan becomes distracted as he learns to speak English and about the human world, and he and Jane are falling in love. After some time the explorers' boat has come to pick up the group, Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas, while Terk and Tantor (Wayne Knight) distract Kerchak, Tarzan does lead the humans to the gorilla nesting grounds, Jane and Porter excitedly mingle with the animals, Kerchak however returns and threatens to kill the humans, Tarzan holds Kerchak back allowing them to get away. Tarzan humiliated by his actions runs away, Kala decides to take him to the treehouse she found him in, he discovers his true past, she tells him she wants him to be happy whatever his decision, he chooses to return with the humans to the ship, but once there he, Jane and Porter are ambushed by Clayton and the stowaway pirate crew, they plan to capture the gorillas. Terk and Tantor rescue Tarzan and the group, they race back to the gorillas' home ground, Kerchak is shot, while Tarzan and Clayton battle in the vine-covered trees, despite Tarzan trying to save him Clayton falls to his death, being hanged in the vines, and in his dying moments Kerchak finally accepts Tarzan, naming him leader of the gorillas, the rest of the gorillas are freed and the pirates are scared away. The next day Jane and Porter prepare to return to England on the ship, Tarzan decides to stay with his gorilla family and troop, however as the boat heads for the ship Porter encourages Jane to stay with the man she loves, she jumps overboard, with Porter following after, and they all embark on their new life together. The animation is as good as you would expect, there are some visually well put together action sequences, and there are some good funny and touching scenes, it does lack some flair, not all the background songs by Phil Collins are too bad, and the family will certainly have some fun, an average animated musical adventure. It won the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for Phil Collins' ""You'll Be In My Heart"". Adequate, but kids will like it!",Tarzan
5,ccthemovieman-1,Animated Tarzan A Pleasant Surprise,8,22 August 2006,"I found this surprisingly good because not only was animation well done - which they all seem to be in the past decade - but an involving, action-packed story that was interesting start-to-finish. The action is not overdone, however. The color in here is magnificent and it looks spectacular on DVD.The film turned out to be a good combination of drama, action, comedy and romance. I would think this would be a little too frightening, however, for little kids, for those wondering about that. The only negative I had was listening to the grating voice of Rose O'Donnell. That, and her New York City, accent, is definitely not appealing. Otherwise, I have nothing but good things to say about this film.",Tarzan
6,Tweekums,"Action, excitement and romance in Disney's version of Tarzan",9,4 December 2019,"As this Disney classic opens a couple and their young baby are shipwrecked on the African coast. Nearby in the jungle a mother gorilla loses her baby to a leopard. Shortly afterwards she hears the human baby crying; when she gets to him it appears that his parents have been killed by the leopard. She decides to adopt him, and names him Tarzan. Against the will of Kerchak, the leader of the gorilla family, he is raised to adulthood. During this time he befriends young gorilla Terk and a baby elephant named Tantor. He grows up believing that he is a gorilla but one day gunfire is heard; he investigates and meets the first people he has seen since he was a baby; an explorer, his daughter Jane, and a hunter. After an incident with a troop of baboons he rescues Jane and is more than a little fascinated by her! Soon he will have to decide whether his future lies in the jungle with the gorillas or back with mankind. He will also have to confront the threat posed by greedy men who seek to profit by capturing his gorilla family.This film is a lot of fun; if you want action, a sense of danger and a touch of romance then you should be most satisfied. The scenes where Tarzan and Jane are chased through the jungle are genuinely thrilling thanks to high quality, very kinetic animation that leaves the viewer feeling as though they are swinging through the jungle with our protagonists. Similarly there is a surprising level of threat for a UK-U rated film... there is a gripping opening scene where baby Tarzan is rescued from the leopard, the aforementioned baboon chase and a gripping finale. Given the rating it is all bloodless of course. The romance between Tarzan and Jane is tender and rather fun. The animation is of a high quality throughout with 2D characters fitting into a more 3D world. The voice cast which includes plenty of familiar names did a fine job bringing their characters to life. The songs, from Phil Collins are pretty good and fit in with the action rather than feeling like musical interludes between exciting scenes. Overall I'd certainly recommend this for fans of Disney or of animated family friendly action.",Tarzan
7,BA_Harrison,Another disappointing 90s offering from Disney.,5,30 September 2006,"With its traditional animation cleverly enhanced by CGI, Tarzan looks fantastic; it's just a shame that the story doesn't crackle and fizz with as much energy as the visuals.With absolutely no respect for its source material, this very loose adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's classic tale is given the full-on Disney approach. Hence, we get a crap Phil Collins song introducing the movie, a host of talking animals, a wisecracking sidekick and a nastier-than-nasty bad guy. And, unfortunately, not much of a story.Tarzan (a little too pointy-chinned and goggle-eyed for my liking), a man raised by gorillas, meets a group of explorers: Professor Archimedes Q. Porter; his daughter, Jane; and nasty Mr. Clayton, a hunter. Realising that he is human, Tarzan faces a dilemma: should he travel to civilisation or stay with his hairy pals in the jungle? While Tarzan is figuring out what to do with his life, trigger-happy Clayton is planning to bag himself a few gorillasPersonally, if I was in Tarzan's shoes (if he wore them, that is), I would travel anywhere just to get away from Terk, an annoying gorilla voiced by Rosie O'Donnell. With an unbelievably grating voice and quite awful characterisation, I wouldn't have been unhappy to see Terk captured and killed, and her paws turned into a nice set of ashtrays! And the same goes for Tantor, the irritating elephantmuch better off as set of umbrella stands and some piano keys!Of course, in true Disney style, Tarzan saves his furry friends from being captured and everything ends happily (except for Clayton, who meets a particularly nasty fate). Tarzan opts to stay in the jungle, accompanied by Jane and her father.Not exactly a classic offering from 'The House of Mouse', but worth seeing, if only for the sumptuous imagery.",Tarzan
8,moonspinner55,Edgar Rice Burroughs tale gets the Disney treatment...results are lively,7,3 August 2011,"Three screenwriters (Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, and Noni White) ably put the proverbial Disney stamp on the now-legendary Edgar Rice Burroughs story, and the King of the Jungle has never looked so good. Fast-moving, colorful animated adventure with Tony Goldwyn as the voice of Tarzan is full of comedy, romance, and songs (the latter courtesy Phil Collins, who performs some wonderful early tunes before lapsing into a repetitive spiral). The usual jokey sidekicks (de rigueur in the company's '90s output), as well as the rushed conclusion, do not detract from a lavishly-designed and sweetly-told tale. There's genuine awe and excitement in the presentation, making ""Tarzan"" one of the finest Disney efforts of this era. *** from ****",Tarzan
9,Quinoa1984,Mind-blowing,7,21 June 2000,"Tarzan brings to the screen song great animation to a usual Disney feature. The tale of Tarzan (now animated) shows a abandoned boy who is raised by gorillas and one day, finds a trio of humans who change his world forever. Much of the animation (mainly when Tarzan is flying in the trees, literally) reminded me of air surfers who swing on the ropes.  Great fun for all, mainly for kids, and some other stuff for animation fanatics (and some might find a connection to this to anime).  One of the better film of the year (that means it is in the top 20).  A+",Tarzan
10,michaelRokeefe,Disney animates the boy raised in the jungle.,6,12 November 2007,"Disney's Buena Vista Pictures presents a genuine animated classic tale of the orphaned infant raised by a family of gorillas. Unconditionaly accepted as one of their own, the young boy called Tarzan garners the instincts of a jungle animal and physically grows into a young man with skills more than the ordinary jungle dweller. His life will change forever when he finally meets other humans and his future life-mate Jane Porter. He realizes there is a new irresistible bond and discovers he is human; but his gorilla family will not forsake him. Entertainment for the entire family. Lending voices to the characters are: Alex D. Linz, Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Lance Henriksen, Wayne Knight and Jason Marsden.",Tarzan
11,studioAT,Tree swinging fun,7,12 June 2011,"Disney had a period of revival during the 1990's and this film is a good example of how they can still create magical stories after all these years.Great storytelling and music from Phill Collins all comes together in a way that only Disney can make happen with the voice casting also matching the vivid animation that takes place in this film.We get a nice love story in this film combined with some laugh out loud moments that remind us all of the immortal line from Walt Disney that ""for every laugh there should be a tear"".Disney may perhaps have been eclipsed by the hip and trendy animation from Blue Sky and Dreamworks but for sheer heart and warmth you cannot beat Disney and that is why films like this one will long live on in the memory while the pop culture laden films of the two previously mentioned companies fade away.",Tarzan
12,CinemaSerf,Simple story well told.,7,4 April 2020,"""Tarzan"" is rescued from the clutches of a tiger and raised in a colony of gorillas. As he gets older, he bonds with the animals around him and ultimately, with a few reservations from the alpha ""Kerchak"", becomes an internal part of the family. Enter a group of British explorers determined to see gorillas and our hero see ""Jane"" for the first time: the love story begins. Their guide ""Clayton"" betrays them all - he wants to sell the apes for £300-a-head in Europe and a colourful, perilous battle of ""civilisations"" ensues. The animations are a bit simple, vey angular - but the characterisations are much stronger. It isn't just a love story with an happy ending; we are taken on their journey of self-discovery as they both introduce the other to their own, drastically, different worlds... Great vocal efforts from Brian Blessed, Minnie Driver and Nigel Hawthorne add some extra fun and lots of pace to this action adventure complemented by a few good songs from Phil Collins.",Tarzan
13,Calicodreamin,Phil Collins 💯,8,10 November 2021,"The soundtrack to Tarzan is unmatched, Phil Collins made each song unique and the right vibe. The storyline is expected and there are few good heartfelt and comedic moments.",Tarzan
14,neil-476,Yes with some no,7,27 July 2009,"It's unusual for a Disney animated feature to be anything other than successful, and Tarzan doesn't buck the trend. It is a solidly entertaining animated feature. Which is not to say that it's perfect.I didn't care for the songs. Disney songs are usually notable for two things: one, they are memorable and, two, they move the story along. Well, perhaps these songs will become more memorable on repeat viewings, but I didn't feel that they moved the story along particularly well. Worse, they seemed horribly familiar, at least a couple seeming to have been bodily lifted, with only minor musical tweaks, from The Lion King. Oh well, perhaps it's just that I don't care for Phil Collns' voice serenading me in a Disney movie.The movie picks up on more of the Burroughs original than most movies before it, but it soft pedals Kerchak. This isn't entirely surprising, and is a reasonable editorial decision. I'd still like to see the original, though.As well as swinging through the jungle using vines, Tarzan has taken to """"surfing"" down moss-covered tree trunks and branches. Well, OK, I suppose. But the production people have come up with some fancy footwork along intertwined branches which supposedly emulates skateboarders skating between obstacles. They are so inordinately proud of this manoeuvre that it appears everywhere - in the movie, in the trailers, in every documentary on the special features DVD. I've got news for you, guys - it looks stupid.And I could do without the comedy sidekicks a retread of Timon and Pumbaa.The story is a serviceable simplification of the original, the voice talent is great (particularly Minnie Driver), and the jungle backgrounds are exquisitely animated - the film is handsome.Maybe I'm just getting picky in my old age!",Tarzan
15,anaconda-40658,Doesn't Quite Swing.,5,2 July 2015,"Tarzan (1999): Dir: Chris Buck, Kevin Lima / Voices: Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Lance Henriksen, Glenn Close, Rosie O'Donnell: Gloriously animated Disney film told for the umpteenth time. Tarzan's parents are killed by a leopard but he is saved by gorillas and raised among them. The mother gorilla hopes to use Tarzan as a replacement for the young she lost to the leopard but the chief silverback objects. Eventually Jane enters the story along with her father and a deceitful poacher. Setup works but payoff is never surprising. What truly works against it is the use of violence. Tarzan faces off against the leopard with a gleaming machete leaving parents with much to discern their children about. Directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima with colourful animation. Many of the voice talents are subdued in stereotypes but Tony Goldwyn gives personality to Tarzan in a manner that works. Minnie Driver steals scenes as the hilarious voice of Jane in an otherwise predictable role. Other roles are mere Disney stereotypes that we have seen countless times. Lance Henriksen voices the strict silverback who wants nothing to do with Tarzan. Glenn Close voices the mother gorilla who wants everything to do with Tarzan. Rosie O'Donnell voices a junior gorilla who is friends with Tarzan because making friends within its own species makes too much sense. Faithful version does little more than animate the recycled. Score: 5 / 10",Tarzan
16,Mr-Fusion,The last gasps of the Disney Renaissance,5,19 September 2016,"Gorgeous animation aside, there's no a whole lot that's memorable about ""Tarzan"". Even the baffling Phil Collins soundtrack is as vanilla as it gets (seriously, the guy owned in the '80s, but by the '90s . . . WTH?). The cast runs from great (Glenn Close) to extremely iffy (Rosie O'Donnell), but even by Disney standards, this isn't the strongest story they've rearranged. Don't get me wrong, I know I'm not the audience for this movie - I'm way too old. My daughter got a lot more out of it than I did. It's great for kids; there's color, movement, etc.It's really not a bad movie, but it's never really satisfying.5/10",Tarzan
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,We need more animation films like this,8,16 May 2006,"Tarzan was kind of like the last real cartoon animation film for Disney, which is sad when you think about it. I miss the films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast. I worry that my future children won't have the same experiences as I used to have, now a days it's Pixar that is the latest craze. Tarzan was an extremely fun movie for the whole family to watch. It had incredible animation and a great and touching story. It does have it's cheesy lesson at the end, but I think that's what makes Disney so special. While I admit, this isn't the best Disney movie, it's still a good one to watch.8/10",Tarzan
18,OllieSuave-007,"The Ape Man, Disney style.",7,23 June 2015,"This is Disney's 37th full-length animated film, a story about Tarzan, an orphan who was raised in the jungle by gorillas. While he befriends many wild animals and considers himself an ape, he must choose which side of the world he belongs in when he meets Jane Porter, a human on an expedition in the jungle.Like most Disney movies, the animation is colorful and vibrant. The overall story has a good combination of drama, adventure, romance and humor, with some suspense built-up during the fierce-some appearances of the antagonistic leopard and the sly human Clayton. The relationship between Tarzan and his adopted gorilla mother Kala is touching, and his friendship between the elephant Tantor and ape Terk is pretty funny. The two provided most of the comic relief in what is otherwise a dramatic film.There are adventurous scenes in abundance, from Tarzan sliding and swinging on trees in the jungle to him do battle with the leopard, Sabor. The first human scenes were a bit boring and dragged the film somewhat and I think some scenes were too intense for a family film, ***spoiler ahead*** the death of Tarzan's parents and some of the gorillas. Those events really brought down the film.***spoiler ends*** Overall, it's not a bad Disney movie, with some great, touching songs by Phil Collins. There are better ones out there, but family might find this one quite entertaining with all the adventures and action.Grade B-",Tarzan
19,Buddy-51,fairly dull version of the classic story,5,11 August 1999,"""Tarzan"", the newest animated feature from the Disney studios, has gotten such universally positive reviews that it is a bit surprising to discover it actually ranks several notches below the best of the recent Disney fare. Lacking the sophisticated wit of ""Aladdin"", the rich emotionalism of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", and the frenetic imaginativess of ""Hercules"", ""Tarzan"" settles for a basically dull, straightforward take on the Edgar Rice Burroughs' legendary tale of a human orphan raised by gorillas who makes the jungle his home.Like many Disney films, ""Tarzan"" continues the tradition of the sentimentalizing of nature, wherein wild animals become either cuddly lowbrow comics or mushyheaded preachers of strictly human virtues.  The message of ""Tarzan"" - respect for both nature and the differences of other - is certainly an admirable one, especially for youngsters, but the heavyhandedness with which it is conveyed weakens its effectiveness.Much of the weakness of the film lies with its screenplay, which fails to deviate much from the formula we have come to expect from children's films.  Tarzan is, essentially, a misfit among his peers, trying desperately to earn acceptance from the ""stepfather"" who refuses to acknowledge Tarzan's value as an individual.  Tarzan's childhood peers - a gorilla ""cousin"" and a sissified elephant - are simply weak echoes of far more entertaining sidekicks in other Disney films.  With the arrival of Jane, her eccentric explorer father and the traditional muscled villain who wants to trap the gorillas and ship them back to England, Tarzan is forced to choose between loyalty to his own kind or to those who raised him.  This leads to dull romantic overtures, some impressive action sequences and even a little much needed wit in the interplay between Jane's father and the other characters in the story.On the positive side, Phil Collins has provided a soaring, driving score, which is beautifully orchestrated and recorded and which, wisely, is performed as voiceovers rather than in the more traditional form of character's themselves singing.  Moreover, much of the animation is impressive, especially Tarzan's swinging frantically through the jungle, and many of the backdrops are lushly gorgeous.It is hard for me to evaluate how well children will respond to this film.  For an adult, requiring a bit more imagination to help fill up the time, ""Tarzan"" requires more patience than those with less time left may care to give.",Tarzan
20,FeastMode,my notes,6,27 July 2019,Well made movie and very enjoyable overall (about 3 viewings),Tarzan
21,ElMaruecan82,The last Hurrah of Disney Renaissance...,7,24 December 2017,"1999 was a cinematic year marked by the seal of originality and self-questioning that fitted the upcoming New Millennium timing, it is also the year where animated movies like ""Toy Story 2"" and the ""South Park"" movie came out and they were so in-line within the modern mood of their era, that they might overshadow ""Tarzan"" despite not being as visually breathtaking.Indeed, for all its spectacular jungle canvas and spellbinding animation (the animators really outdid themselves), not to mention its heartfelt story not devoid of a few existential undertones, ""Tarzan"" might be too 'classic' for its own good. The film is often noticed for being the last of the Disney Renaissance era, and it is true that if we forget the sorry streak of straight to video sequels of the early 2000's, Disney had definitely surrendered to the CGI wave after that. But ""Tarzan"" was made a bit too late, when the pulse of animation was beating in 3D and when the torch of traditional animation had already passed to Hayao Miyazaki. ""Chihiro's Travel"" is light years ahead of ""Tarzan"".I liked Tarzan a lot despite my criticism, I loved the relationship he had with his environment and the character of Kala, his adoptive mother voiced by Glenn Close, who is certainly one of the most memorable mother figures of Disney canons. There must be something about Close's voice as she was also remarkable as Homer Simpson's mother. The character of Jane is also a nice twist on the usual love interest figure and Minnie Driver delivers a fine performance as a girl always in good mood, curious about everything and whose awkwardness with Tarzan is both touching and funny. I loved the lighthearted tone of the encounter between Tarzan and Jane, the way they both try to communicate (we get it that the English spoken with animals is just the usual artistic license and that it's meant to be a series of articulate grunts and adequate body language) and how a well-meaning Tarzan tries to fit between the two worlds. Voiced by Tony Goldwyn, Tarzan is certainly deeper than most Disney protagonists, torn between the love and friendship of some and the defiance of other, most notably, Kala's mate, voice by Lance Henrikssen, who refuses to recognize him as a son.We do root for Tarzan, he's certainly an engaging hero but just when ou try to except something really worthy of this character, the film just never feels like delivering something reasonably new and fresh, if we except the splendid special effects, but from the trailer, viewers already knew about the surfing across the trees sequences, perhaps one of Disney's greatest moments. The problem is that the relationships, as original as they are, fail to blow the mind of an audience who's seen ""The Jungle Book"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or even ""Pocahontas"". The blame might also be on the weakness of the main villain (Brian Blessed) and the too distractingly old and goofy father (Nigel Hawthorne), I couldn't believe he would be Jane's father but Disney has a tendency to make little goofy midgets fathering beautiful and tall women, at least Tarzan looked like his real parents. Both the bad guy and the professor were rather dependable and maybe the story could have worked better without them, but I guess the purpose of the film was to culminate with a men vs. animal confrontation with Tarzan as the common denominator, but they could have found a more original climactic action sequence. The songs are touching and poignant like Phil Collins' songs but in a year where the ""South Park"" movie provided at least three Oscar-worthy songs, I won't forgive the Academy for having taken the easy choice. So I won't develop that chapter and will conclude by saying that ""Tarzan"" is certainly the last hurrah of Disney Renaissance and a great animated film in the sense that the animation is great and the story engaging but not to the point you'd want to watch it a second time.I'm a father and since today is Christmas, I just remembered I often bought Disney DVDs to my daughter and ""Tarzan"" is one of the rarest ones, there must be a reason, don't you think?",Tarzan
22,g-bodyl,Entertaining and Fast-Paced!,9,14 July 2013,"In the 1990's, Disney came out with a bunch of classic animated films that pushed the boundary of animated films at the time such as Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Lion King and they also came out with Pixar which had Toy Story and A Bug's Life. The final year of that decade, they released this film, Tarzan. This film reminds me of Disney classics of old. It's a fun, entertaining film that is crisply animated and has a good story.Based off the creation of Edgar Burrough Rice, this film is about a kid who was shipwrecked with his family and is orphaned after his parents were killed by Sabor, a vicious leopard. He is taken in by a herd of gorillas if somewhat reluctantly. Years later, another group of humans come into the area and Tarzan meets Jane and that's where he finds out there are more just like him.This film has a good voice cast. There is some good talent here such as Glenn Close, Brian Blessed, Minnie Driver, and even Lance Henricksen.Overall, this is a very entertaining Disney film. Despite the fact that this film is rated G, adults will like this film even more than the younger ones since it has some mature themes. Another plus is this movie has a very powerful soundtrack thanks to the excellent talent of Phil Collins. This is not the best Disney film, but it's still quite magnificent. I rate this film 9/10.",Tarzan

24,John6Daniels,Hello Newman...,8,7 March 2021,"Disney dominated in the 90s. TARZAN was a beaut of a movie.It's about a lost boy growing up in the jungle and blue eyed poachers invade.This movie takes its time to tell a story without the forced modern day toilet humour.The animation was beautiful. The colours were a delight.The villian is manipulative as ever.The supporting cast do a splendid job.Tarzan lead the film really well.Overall a magnificent movie for the fam. Only thing I'll nitpick is Tarzan speaking fine English with his gorilla tribe then when he talks to the humans he can't speak at all.
I understand why, although it still looked ironic.What can be learned? Sometimes unity is a curse.Verdict: in the jungle... The gorillas sleep tonight.",Tarzan
25,briancham1994,Excellent animation,8,2 June 2020,"This film's highlight is the animation of the jungle and Tarzan swinging through the trees. It all flows so smoothly and naturally that you don't notice the effort put into it. This, combined with compelling characters and story, make Tarzan a worthy addition to the Disney Animated Canon.",Tarzan
26,johnnyboyz,Healthy Disney entry that struggles in its representation and narrative but holds up with music and animation.,6,23 March 2008,"I do not think this film lacks the Disney 'spark', nor do I think it lacks the Disney 'magic' that so many of their films carry and that makes them so enjoyable. If anything, this Disney effort doesn't have any magic at all but that is only from a subjective point of view regarding the film's content itself. Whereas past protagonists have had magic lamps, have magically been given legs and have suffered magical epiphanies that makes them wan to go back and fight for what is rightfully theirs; Tarzan, as a film, is more down to Earth and on this level is more of a 'realistic' Disney film.This is not the first Disney film to deal with colonialism of some sort. 1995's Pocahontas had similar themes of outsiders visiting a rural utopia in which morals and understandings were happily being lived out. Like Tarzan, Pocahontas was a very 'real' film what with it being set in this world but its boundaries were blurred a little when that willow tree started talking to the characters. In this case, the outsiders visiting the rural world are initially only very few with the rest of the crew and the 'Governor Ratcliffe' character not yet apart of proceedings although Clayton (Blessed) looks suspiciously like the 1995 film's antagonist. One of the other two characters initially part of the set up is Jane (Driver) who, in a reverse of Pocahontas' set up, is a female visiting a male 'savage' rather than the other way around. Finally, as a villain, Clayton embodies all the necessary psychical traits of Ratcliffe as well as the dreams of a bigger and better life for him back home (at the expense of the new found riches, of course)So this film has a lot in common with Pocahontas in that sense but is it that good? Is it perhaps better than Pocahontas? My opinion is 'no, it is not' but it does come strikingly close to being better. Like I said, this does not lack Disney magic and Disney spark but that does not mean it contains enough anyway. From a storytelling point of view, Tarzan is pretty poor but so was 1992's Aladdin  only thing there was that it had the Genie character to keep laughs and entertainment flowing thick and fast; there is no loud and magical 'kick' to this, just a simple 'girl-meets-boy' premise and a sad back-story regarding the hero's parents. But that's the way it goes in terms of storytelling. On the whole, I was impressed. It is clear that the producers saw George of the Jungle from two years previous and were impressed by Brendan Fraser's performance of George; in terms of look and physique than actual acting because Tarzan in the film looks strikingly like him. There is also the way the film toys with the character of Tarzan, giving him the human instincts that he should possess and hinting at his soon to be obvious journey of self-discovery. During the course of the opening, Tarzan will invent the knife and he will upgrade it to a spear when he attaches a stick to it thus leaving behind the 'gorilla' method of merely climbing and reaching for fruit during a food gathering montage instead of using initiative and inventing something to tackle the situation. Tarzan will also use his man advantages to defeat a threat to the clan further emphasising his superiority over the strongest gorilla, Kerchak (Henriksen).But the film suffers from not only those things that hold back a Disney film when it comes to issues of equality, but also things of a film making nature. Firstly, the film has a problem with the space in which the characters inhabit, frequently ignoring logic and substituting it for laughs  since the film does not have a 'genie' or a set of cutlery or a 'Timon and Pumbaa' to get across the laughs that kids and some adults will enjoy, it needs to have Tarzan and Jane surfing down tree trunks; flying uncontrollably through the air and landing ridiculously safely as well as a bizarre and somewhat out of place chase involving a hoard of baboons. Not only this but Disney's now obligatory issues of representation creep in; I may have let them slide previously but when I am apart of the targeted group, I take offence. The English sailors are perceived as conniving and are somewhat evil  there are 'good' sailors but they are never presented and do not have a lot of screen time. Furthermore, Jane and her father come across as rather inept and innocent in their bumbling and comic antics. This is also the reason Tarzan's blood parents do not speak because they too are 'good' English characters.Then there are the other characters. The gorillas and Tarzan himself are all American with Tarzan's best friend Terk bizarrely adopting a Brooklyn accent; Tarzan's mother and Kerchak are also American and are put across as good people  no coincidence that the American gorillas all have morals and established ways of living before the interfering Europeans arrive with their big ideas. But if you delve deep enough into the Earth, you will destroy it as you will reach the core  Tarzan is still enjoyable and Phil Collins presents a great soundtrack. The premise may be cute and the execution equally so, but this is not a strong effort as the weak and anticlimactic final third would confirm.",Tarzan
27,TheMovieDiorama,"Tarzan swings through the iridescent jungle swiftly, ending Disney's Renaissance era with wild exuberance.",7,4 November 2019,"Two worlds, one family. An innocent little boy, approximately four-years old, was escorted for the first time to a cinema complex. Politely requesting a bucket of sweet polystyrene popcorn, he walked into the dimly lit auditorium scavenging for an appropriate seat that would maximise his film experience. The trailers initiated, suppressing the inner excitement of the full feature that was yet to commence. Then, it happened. The Disney logo emerged. It was time. A family surviving a shipwreck, colonising an uncharted jungle whilst the emphatic voice of Phil Collins powered the narrative. A leopard savaging a baby gorilla, then brutally slaying the English couple, leaving only their infant son crying. His sorrowful echoes reverberating through the rainforest, until a female gorilla acquires him. Adopting a human child. Tarzan. The four-year old, naive to the cruelty of nature, was transfixed by the colourful animation. The plethora of emotions. That pure Disney magic. It was the commencement of a new-founding love for cinema. An adoration he could never shake off again. Yes, that four-year old, was me.Subjectively speaking, Tarzan is more than just another Disney classic from their animated library. Even more than just an adaptation of Burroughs' epic. It was a trigger. A sweeping adventure that upheld every emotional resonance possible. The brooding romance between explorer Jane and fully-adolescent Tarzan. Thematically presenting ostracism through two interconnected species, conveying the ""Two Worlds, One Family"" conflict within Tarzan. Who we are raised to be and who we are truly meant to become. Comedic buoyancy through the supporting characters of Terk and Tantor, supplied with their own catchy rhythms. Dark antagonisms through Clayton's treacherous hunting techniques, viewing gorillas as merchantable assets. An exploration into the vivacious rainforests of Africa. All culminating to form a wonderfully effervescent coming-of-age tale. One of Disney's most overlooked, for sure.The art direction is the strongest of the Renaissance period, combining traditional hand-drawn animation with pioneering three-dimensional backgrounds. Often incorporating visual montages to steer the narrative into the intended direction. Watercolour backdrops to enhance the naturalistic environment. Bright character designs to contrast the darkened background. Sublimely directed by Lima and Buck. Then, Phil Collins just being the legendary musician that he is, providing the tale with apathy and soul. The ""Two Worlds"" anthem, ""You'll be in my Heart"" and ""Strangers Like Me"". Mancina's score actively preventing the characters from singing and turning into another unnecessary musical. As I said, subjectively I refuse to liken Tarzan to just another animation from the ""House of Mouse"". It was my first cinema endeavour after all.However, objectively, there are narrative stumbles. It's the breeziest story, condensing an epic plot into less than ninety minutes. The most noticeable consequence of this, is the rushed editing on certain segments. The introductory two minutes is a whirlwind of emotional storytelling that, unfortunately, holds minimal foundations. The montages of Tarzan growing up also lacked narrative heft, providing nothing more than visual delights. Goldwyn, Close and O'Donnell had insufficient power within their voice roles. Although Driver and Blessed were delightful. And, as much as I adore the song, the repetitious reprises of ""Two Worlds"" throughout minimised lyrical diversity.The entire story is told faster than a shotgun firing, but I refuse to shake my undying adoration for this feature. Tarzan was the film that made me the cinephile that I am today. If I hadn't received that euphoric pleasure from the cinema back in '99, well, these amateur reviews probably would never have been written. Ever. So for that, Tarzan and Disney have my eternal gratitude.",Tarzan
28,Vartiainen,*incoherent drooling due to the quality of the animation*,9,24 November 2015,"This movie is gorgeous! It makes me wish I was a better poet so I could do it justice with words. It is the reason why man makes pictures with colours. I could take any single frame, especially any single background, hang it on my wall and be perfectly happy with it. It's beautiful beyond words, beyond my ability to express it properly.It's also the end of an era. The last film of the Disney Renaissance. There are still good Disney films to come, but never again have we had such a streak of quality, of ambition and willingness to push the limits of what you can do with animation. And as far as I'm concerned, they could have done a lot worse than this film as a swan song. They took a relatively simple, yet classic book by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which is very clearly a product of its time, and updated it to the next millennium. A man raised in the jungles of Africa and meeting people like him for the first time in his life is a brilliant basic idea for a story and Disney utilizes it beautifully, giving us a tale full of excitement, interesting characters, emotions, adventure, plots and betrayals, love and learning, courage and above all understanding.They've also updated the characters a little bit. Tarzan isn't quite as masculine and demigod-ish as he is in the book, and Jane isn't just a damsel to be rescued. Jane's father, the professor, is essentially the same though, which isn't a problem as his role is rather minimal, whereas the gorillas have been given some actual roles and characteristics. Unfortunately they failed Clayton utterly as a character, which is the only real problem with the film. I get that they needed a clearly defined villain for the film, but they have made layered villains before. Judge Frollo and Scar, for example. Both were clearly the villains of their films, but they had complicated motivations and were willing to utilize every advantage they had. Clayton is simply a big white hunter with a huge gun. Nothing interesting about that.Plus I'm personally rather annoyed by Rosie O'Donnell's Terk, but that's just me. The character is objectively just fine.All in all Tarzan fails to reach that all around perfection movies such as Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King have, but it's still one of my favourite Disney films, and definitely one of the best looking. The music is also great, the characters are great - with one glaring exception - and overall it's definitely under-appreciated for its sheer quality.",Tarzan
29,lisafordeay,The last ever good Disney movie to come out of the 1990s before the new era began,9,14 August 2013,"As a kid Tarzan was one of my all time favourite movies and even up to this day it STILL excites me and here are a few reasons why I love this movie.#1 The Story: Now a lot of Disney movies have great storytelling's but this one was brilliant. From the very beginning where we meet Tarzan as a baby with his parents as they escape their boat that went up in fire,to the part where we cut to the ape Kayla(voiced by Glen Close whom you may know was also Cruella De Vil in 101 and 102 Dalmatians)who rears Tarzan as her own(yeah its been done countless times before but who cares)to the gripping finale,it was just brilliant.#2 The music: I ADMIT it I love Phil Collins,from his Genesis days to his solo career he was the best musician of all time before he gave up singing and playing the drums due to some difficulties. I loved ALL the songs in this film,they were all so brilliant and my favourite has to be either You'll Be In My Heart or Strangers Like Me cause they were so memorable. Also Son Of A Man was so good.#3 Animation: Flawless and colorful.#4 The charcther design for Tarzan: I had the weirdest crush on him as a kid and heck I still find him attractive. I dunno why but I love how former Disney animator Glen Keane made him so fit and strong. Rumors had it that Glen based Tarzan on his son which was pretty cool.Everything else was brilliant too and it was kinda sad that this will forever be the last great hand drawn movie before Disney turned their flicks into Computer Generated format to beat Pixar but at least 14 years after this was made ANOTHER brilliant movie won me over...but you probably know what that is so I'm gonna leave it at that.Overall Tarzan is breathtaking and amazing and gets a 9.5/10",Tarzan
30,FiendishDramaturgy,Excellent Disney fare. One of the best.,8,28 October 2003,"Okay. They rewrote the whole legend. But Disney has an unerring way of doing that. Anyone remember Pocahontas? They even changed Cinderella, Snow White, and every other Disney Masterpiece sitting on your shelves, so why does it matter that this, too, was changed?It matters on several different levels, but the most important reason it matters is because Disney, in their positioning among the children's entertainment market, is in the unique position to actually teach these legends, these snippets of history, these morals and ethics, to the children of their audiences, rather than proffering sugar-coated, merchandized over-glorifications in exchange for the great American dollar. That having been said, this is still an entertaining introduction to the legend, but I highly suggest ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,"" (1984), directed by Hugh Hudson. It is the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen, and a highly enjoyable adventure, which carries a PG rating and is safe for most ages to view.A lot has been said about the deep canvas effect used throughout the jungle scenes, and I must admit that I found the technique highly effective and extremely well done. I do computer graphics myself, and I was very impressed with the 3D effects throughout, including the water variants and textures used in the ship scenes, the fire effects used in the jungle, and the smoke effects from the guns used by the poachers. The textures and backgrounds were absolutely stunning, and for me, as a graphics artist, that's what I look for when I view a quality animation.Very good endeavor.It rates an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Tarzan
31,runamokprods,"Sweet, funny, touching animated fun",8,13 October 2014,"While not up to the level of sophistication of the best Pixar films, or even the very best of Disney, this has an admirable sense of humor, and an ability to be quite touching at times (if occasionally sappy). It also has some surprisingly dark and violent moments that might put it off limits to younger kids, who in other ways are its perfect audience. This takes the basic Tarzan story and focuses mainly on Tarzan's need and ability to be accepted by the Gorilla clan he is adopted into, offering slightly obvious but always valuable lessons in accepting those who look or act different. It also has a spunky and even sexy Jane – an explorer who comes to Africa with her scientist father, and (of course) an evil guide looking to capture and enslave the apes. Jane's romance with Tarzan is funny, playful and sometimes moving. The animation is generally energetic, kinetic and fun, and I found myself nicely caught up in the story. Unlike some animated features, I actually wasn't sure exactly how things would work themselves out. I also appreciated that Phil Collins' songs, which tended to hit the nail a little too hard on the head, were few and far between. If they weren't great, they didn't really damage the film either. It sounds like I'm damning this with faint praise, but the bottom line is I had a good time. I smiled, I chuckled, and I got choked up. When ANY film – animated or not - can do all three for me, I consider that a solid victory.",Tarzan

After reaching adulthood he finds himself caught between two worlds and must make a choice between his now foreign homeland and the only home he's ever known.Razor thin, Cliff notes version of the Tarzan story skates by (or is that swings?) on gorgeous visuals, a surprisingly strong and emotional bond between Tarzan and his adoptive ape mother and a charmingly quirky performance from Minnie Driver as Jane.As a courtesy I must warn you that approx. 79 of its 88 minute runtime contains music by Phil Collins.

33,r96sk,It's a cracker,8,7 July 2020,"'Tarzan' is one of those films that I had always assumed I had seen, though evidently I hadn't and this was my first time watching. It's a cracker!Phil Collins' music is tremendous, it truly adds a lot to the film - ""Son of Man"", which I already knew about, is a great song which works very well with the montage. Some of the editing is rather sharp, while the animation is pleasing on the eye.Tony Goldwyn (Tarzan) and Minnie Driver (Jane) suit their respective roles nicely, as do Glenn Close (Kala) and Brian Blessed (Clayton). Rosie O'Donnell is the one I enjoyed most, as she portrays Terk - which isn't really a massive character, yet O'Donnell makes her memorable.It does feature things you've seen from earlier jungle based films, like 1967's 'The Jungle Book' and, as expected yet still amusingly, 1997's 'George of the Jungle'. The early scenes in-particular, which rely firmly on Collins' music - from the midway point it's more level, whilst also taking its own route with this type of story.I'm interested to find out where the two follow-up films go.",Tarzan
34,MissSimonetta,A film still in my heart,8,3 July 2020,"I find films that mark the end of an era quite interesting. Such categorization largely applies to TARZAN, often considered the penultimate entry of the Disney Renaissance. TARZAN is among the more dramatic movies of this period, along with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or MULAN, though it has unobtrusive comedy as well. Like many of the Renaissance films, it features a protagonist who yearns for something more out of their life. Like many Renaissance films, the visuals are gorgeous.Undoubtedly, it is a beautiful film: the backgrounds and character animation are jaw-dropping in how gorgeous they are. When I was rewatching TARZAN the other day, my heart ached for the days of traditional animation at Disney. CG animation can be very lovely, but it's hard to imagine these visuals having comparable impact. I love the character designs here, particularly Jane: her face is not the traditional Disney Princess look. She looks very unique.However, TARZAN is not only the end of an era, but a liminal film, suggesting the strange (sometimes great, sometimes not) movies which were to come out of Disney in the early 2000s. The Phil Collins music, easily the most divisive aspect of this film, replaces the Broadway style musical numbers of the previous Renaissance films, and this sort of musical accompaniment style would be used in several of the films to come such as LILO AND STITCH (where Elvis music accompanies montages), BROTHER BEAR, and TREASURE PLANET. Overall, I like the music-- I think the music fits the story well and they're catchy.TARZAN is not the best of the Renaissance films, but it is damn good and I enjoy rewatching it every few years. I actually remembered a great deal of shots and dialogue too-- I must have watched it more times as a kid than I remembered. It strikes me as a beautiful movie from the twilight of one of Disney's golden ages and it's weathered the years well.",Tarzan

36,noralee,"Fun Animation, Character Voices and Music",10,21 December 2005,"I loved ""Tarzan""! I was afraid that Disney would cheap out on the romance but there was enough in it for me.I liked the Phil Collins drums, but wasn't crazy about his voice throughout the whole film (nor were the restless toddlers in the audience), rather than character voices singing.The animation was wonderful,incorporating computers and gels.The elephant was too much like Horton Hears A Who, but Rosie O'Donnell's voicing of the ape friend was wonderful.(originally written 7/12/1999)",Tarzan

The animals looked like they were designed for a different movie--a very bland, uninspired one. I especially couldn't stand the sidekick gorilla.

38,Spleen,"Great animation, gorgeous jungle, fine myth, and ...",8,2 September 1999,"""Hercules"", ""Mulan"", ""Tarzan"".  Three films in a row that are much better than they're generally supposed to be; but each is hobbled by a particularly damaging flaw.  What gives me hope is that it's a DIFFERENT flaw each time. Something wounds each film and leaves it still pretty good but in no danger of being a masterpiece, and it's always a different something.  You can look up my comments on the first two if you want to see what I think the problem is there.  I'll get to Tarzan's weakness in due course.I must admit I was apprehensive when I saw some of the character designs beforehand: the little gorilla Terk, the elephants, Archimedes Q. Porter (the very name makes me wince) - they all look like cutesy rejects from other Disney movies.  But the proof of animation is in the motion.  And the characterisation, as well as the animation, of Terk and Porter, is much more interesting than motionless drawings of them would suggest.  Then there's the marvellously understated tribe of gorillas.  And there's Tarzan himself: a man who thinks he's a gorilla who surfs through a world of branches and vines, and it couldn't look more natural.New computer techniques were used to render the jungle, and as the jungle was everywhere, so were the computers.  Does this make your blood run cold? Well, it ought to.  Computer animation has ruined many a film, animated and live action, before this, and will ruin many a film to come.  And the constant use of computers DOES generate the occasional awkwardness.  But that's the worst that can be said.  Actually, most of the images began life on paper, and the computers just turn them into a lush, three-dimensional world, into which Tarzan and the gorillas fit perfectly.  ""Deep Canvas"" would have been disastrous elsewhere but it isn't here.In starting with ""Tarzan of the Apes"" Disney placed itself in an enviable position - they couldn't possibly produce something worse than the book. Not that I've read the book.  Edgar Rice Burroughs is almost unreadable. He is, quite possibly, the very worst writer to have made any kind of mark on the twentieth century, and that's saying a lot.  He made his mark not by being able to put a sentence together, but by creating myths - or rather, by taking myths that were in the air and putting just enough flesh on them for the public to notice them.  His illustrators really deserve as much credit as he does.  Whatever.  Disney has captured most of the beauty of the Tarzan myth and made a moving story out of it.So what's the catch?  It's the music.  More precisely, it's the baleful influence of MTV, in all its aspects.  Item: we open with a couple and their child aboard a scuttled ship, trying to make it to shore - and no sooner have we grasped this, than does Phil Collins intrude on our thoughts and sing about it.  That it's a terrible song is the least of my complaints. The real problem is that it's beyond all doubt, as clear as the glare of the sun, that the song has no business being there.  Look: if you want to have songs, be honest about it, and make the film a musical.  If you don't want to make a musical then leave out the songs.  It's as simple as that.  In a musical, singing is an extension of talking, and songs can arise naturally out of speech.  Voice-over rock songs of this kind can't.  (An attempt is made to do so in one case, and it falls flat.)  Nor can these rock songs arise out of, or be part of, the musical score.  All they can do is get in the way.  This is particularly glaring here because ""Tarzan"" has the ambition and the capacity to be more than a bit of ""Flashdance"" rubbish. It's MUCH more than a music video.  So why does it sometimes act like one? -Oh, yes, that's the other problem: some of the editing and camera movement belongs on a weekend top-of-the-pops television program, distracting us from the poverty of the music; not here, disfiguring the animation.These were my thoughts in the first few minutes.  In those minutes are the worst.  It gets much better, largely because the Phil Collins music video style simply can't be sustained.  ""Tarzan"" is still very good.  It's just that it would have been a lot better if it had been honestly a musical, or honestly not a musical.",Tarzan

42,MR_Heraclius,Great way to close out the renaissance.,10,21 February 2020,"Tarzan (1999) - is the final movie in the Disney Renaissance and it certainly was a great note to leave on. The story is very basic and easy to follow but they allow so much to happen when it comes to character development and showing off the incredible surroundings of the jungle. All the characters are very memorable and I especially love the way they work Tarzan and Jane's relationship. I love how each of them work of each other and how Jane helps Tarzan understand the ways of the human life. The gorillas also have their moments of tenderness and I do like how each of their views of Tarzan are well understandable. I kinda will admit that the villain is sort of weak but he still acts as a major threat to Tarzan even though it's kinda obvious how Disney is hiding the fact that he's really a villain and not a good guy. The way they work the animation is absolutely incredible. it is just mind blowing and how they manage to combine hand-drawn animation with CGI effects. It makes the look of the jungle feel so immersive and lifelike. The action scenes definitely are proof of how great the animation is and it moves at such a fast and steady pace. it's probably some of the most action pack stuff I've ever seen in a hand drawn film. The overall music score is great for setting the mood and any type of scene. Whether there's a heartfelt scene or an action-packed sequence, the music is always there to accompany whatever is happening on screen. Phil Collins wrote and performed a few songs for the movie and I think all of them are heartfelt and catchy. They are all greatly separated from one another and they play their part whenever the moment is right.

45,Stampsfightclub,excellent show of the differences between animals and humans,8,29 July 2008,"A man, who has spent his whole life being raised by gorillas, must discover who he is and where he belongs when humans visit the jungle where he lives.In perhaps one of the most under-appreciated Disney films of the 90's, viewers are given an insight into the life of a man who must question who and what he is in the face of danger and humanity. The plot is a very romantic tale about the human spirit and has a very intriguing point of view upon humans, who are again in the darkness as villains in this Disney picture.Tarzan embodies the good nature about the human spirit with a heroic and loyal ideology towards the lives of others, but the humans who come to investigate the gorillas such as Clayton are the epitome of evil, and through the use of good vs evil and loyalty does the plot excel as a sharp and sentimental story about finding who you truly are. Humour is thrown in as good measure with the very enjoyable Jane, Terk and Tantor who all have their moments in this lovable tale.Though the humour is frequently used throughout, this is one of the most serious Disney films of recent years, and that is shown through the use of man against animal, and the inhuman nature of the humans, a very serious issue and one particular shot towards the end when the gorillas are all looking down, all sitting peacefully in their trees, all quiet and minding their own business, shows them as they are, extremely beautiful animals who are being disturbed by a group of violent money thirsty selfish humans.Its sad that there aren't many 2D animations being made now, as classics such as these look so brilliant and are basic, but with technology being so advanced, it is hard to see a way back into this brilliant format. The soundtrack by Phil Collins is exceptional and one of the best ever created for a Disney picture.Though the plot can be inconsistent and the direction not on top form, it is a sentimental and humours tale which examines the differences between animal and man.",Tarzan

I thought that Tarzan was a great movie for the whole family. Tarzan stars Glenn Close in a much better voice over role than her role in 101, or 102 Dalmatians. Voices include that of Tony Goldwyn, Rosie O'Donnell, Wayne Knight, and Nigel Hawthorne. My favorite character in this film was the elephant, Tantor. And the songs by Phil Collins were just spectacular, even winning an Oscar for ""You'll be in My Heart"".This film comes from a long line of Tarzan films, but stands out the most, mainly because it is the only animated feature film of Tarzan. A great film for children and parents alike. A 9/10 rating.",Tarzan
48,stamper,"You can call me a big, 19 year old child, but I know I liked this one",8,9 November 2000,"This is really a good effort from Disney, for they are able to pull something off many movies do not succeed in, they have made an interesting, exciting, moving and funny film. It is even harder, I presume to do such a thing with a story that has been told often before and everyone knows and then to get it done good as an animated feature is even harder. This is (in my opinion) a much better effort than for instance A bug's Life (I haven't seen Dinosaur, Mulan and Toy Story 2 yet) and that is the reason why for me it is the studio's best effort since Hercules.
What I really admire in Disney's animated features is how real they are. It becomes less obvious that it is an animated feature every time I see one and a lot of computer animation is used also. The high point of reality I feel is that the character of Jane Potter (voiced by Minnie Driver) even resembles the person who gave her the voice a bit at some points. But that might be just a bit subjective for I really like Minnie Driver and I immediately knew it was her when I heard the voice, so maybe I'm just imagining things. What I do know though is that Jane and Terk (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) were my favorite characters and not, as you might expect Tarzan (which by the way does not mean that Tarzan sucked and you did not feel for him).
My advice to all (young or old) is to see this movie for it is not a movie for kids only

49,Animany94,A few adjustments could possibly make it perfect.,8,17 August 2017,"Firstly, let me say that Tarzan is a wonderful piece of animation with CG-backgrounds blending in flawlessly behind 2D rendered characters. In some movies I CG-backgrounds ugly and unpleasant (Titan A.E. for instance). I like the action scenes and the soft moments, both do good jobs at catching the audience. The songs are memorable as well, probably the finest work of Phil Collins as a singer/songwriter. And now for my few adjustments. They should have scrapped Clayton as the villain and made Sabor the main villain. Sapora kills Tarzan's parents! And brutally battles Tarzan in one scene! I would have loved to see more of that. Perhaps that would have changed the story significantly, but I would still love to see it. Aside from that little thing I really like the final product",Tarzan
50,mitsubishizero,What a great movie!,10,17 August 2019,"I grew up watching this and I have to say it's aged pretty well. The songs by Phil Collins are memorable. I find myself humming ""Son of Man"" from time to time. The animation's amazing to this day. When Tarzan slides and swings on a tree it looks cool. The characters have interesting personalities and are fun to watch. As for the story it's pretty interesting.Tarzan gets adopted by a pack of gorillas after his real parents get killed by a leopard named Sabor. Growing up isn't easy as he struggles to fit in and keep up with the pack but slowly and slowly he figures out how to with the help of his friends the wise-cracking Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) and the timid elephant Tantor (Wayne Knight). One day he saves a woman from a pack of angry baboons and notices she's like him. Her name is Jane Porter (Minnie Driver) and she's the daughter of a professor from England. Aiding her in her research is her father (Nigel Hawthorne) and an arrogant hunter named Clayton (Brian Blessed).Tarzan helps them while also learning more about his past leading to their worlds being changed forever.What can I say that hasn't been said about this? I think it would've been cool to see more of Tarzan's childhood as that seems mostly glossed over. Aside from that Tarzan's a great movie anyone can enjoy. Swing on in and check it out.",Tarzan

Years later I re-watched it for having some nostalgic evening and yes, I still loved it like when I was a child. And I put it among my favourite Disney movies. Since the story of Tarzan is well known as there are at least 100 other movies about him, I won't be long.I liked almost all the characters. Tarzan is a very charismatic lead. My favourite characters were Terk (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) and Kerchak (voiced by Lance Henriksen). Minnie Driver, Glenn Close and Wayne Knight do a very good voice over work. The animation is very colorful and the soundtrack is probably the best thing about the movie. The many Phil Collins songs fit well the lead's spirit.Overall, if you love Disney movies then you'll love this one too as it's among the best from the Renaissance period.",Tarzan
52,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,Another Disney classic based on the character by Edgar Rice Burroughs,9,21 April 2012,"After such great Disney hits like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Mulan, Disney tried on another original story based on the Tarzan character by Edgar Rice Burroughs and boy did they succeed. It tells how Tarzan came to the jungle and how he came to be the protector of the gorilla family by any means necessary.The story is very original with some emotionally touching moments that would make you cry and some intense dark moments. The songs by Phil Collins are great with ""Two Worlds"", ""Strangers Like Me"", and ""You'll Be In My Heart"" as the best. The characters are great and the interactions between them are pretty good. Tarzan is a great character with a darker back-story as a baby when his parents got killed by the cheetah. Jane, the love interest, is so beautiful and likable to enjoy and so was her father Professor Porter. The sidekicks including Terk and Tantor are funny and likable. Kerchak and Kala are also pretty good with their great interactions with Tarzan.I hate to say this, but the only character that I hated the most was the villain Clayton, who was by far the worst Disney villain I've ever seen. The voice actor for him wasn't that bad, but the character itself kind of bothered me. He just wants to find and bring all of the gorillas from the island to get money and it kind of reminded me of Govenor Ratcliffe. It's the Pocahontas villain all over again! His personality was boring and even his Dialogue is also boring. It would've been better if Disney made the cheetah (who killed a baby ape and Tarzan's parents) into a Shere-Khan type villain and that would be cool. Instead we get a greedy human male villain trying to get rich and boy what a complete letdown for a villain! With the villain out of the way, everything else turned out great. The animation is unbelievably amazing with some creating surfing on the tree vines that Tarzan (I was like, ""Wow! That was awesome and creative! Great job, Disney!"" when I saw that scene) along with some nice visuals. The music from Mark Macina is also pretty good with a great mixture of drama, emotion, suspense, and adventure all together and the pacing well-done.The voice actors are flawless and excellent. Tony Goldwyn did great as Tarzan, Minnie Driver did awesome as Jane, Glenn Close did great as Kala, Lance Henriksen did very good as Kerchak, Rosie O Donnell and Wayne Knight were hilarious as Terk and Tantor, Nigel Hawthorne (who later died in December 26, 2001) did very well as Professor Porter and Brian Blessed was very decent as Clayton.Overall, despite the weak Disney villain, Tarzan is by no means a classic that would always be watched again and again to fans of Disney young and old.",Tarzan

54,Movie-12,"Great animation, with massive structural flaws. **1/2 out of ****",6,27 June 1999,"Sometimes I get feeling that audiences delight in Disney movies simply because they're pure, wholesome, family oriented, well animated.and released by Disney. Unfortunately, that is not enough to make a movie worth seeing. The film cartoon version of ""Tarzan"" will surely appeal to children under the age of 10, and many conservative adults. Like ""Mighty Joe Young,"" however, this film suffers from several structural flaws and a few crucial character bloopers that make this journey into the jungle stand far from becoming a memorable Disney experience.""Tarzan"" is the story of a young couple and their baby boy who, while sailing at sea, encounter a disastrous event and become shipwrecked on a large tropical island. They adapt to the new climate and build a massive tree house to for themselves to live in.However, they are not the only family living on that island. For a group of wild gorilla's are active nearby. When a single ape stumbles opon the deserted tree house and discovers that a sneaky tiger has broken into the humble home and killed the parents of a crying baby, she curiously gathers him up and starts back to her family.As in most movies of this genre, once discussed the theory of keeping this child as one of their one, daddy objects and is forever against the new member of the household, but they keep him anyway.The main structural flaw in this movie is the continuousness of  the theory of drama being played over and over: it begins with one problem and ends when it is solved. In ""Tarzan,"" the first problem is the shipwreck, and the solution is the family building a tree house. There you have it, enough for an entire movie in itself. Why not detail the family's adventures stranded on a tropical island over the years instead of almost immediately creating an internal problem, the leader of the gorilla pack is against the new family member; Tarzan. Then, how about the boy's problem's with his differences from the rest of his family: another internal problem--one that isn't meant to be solved. The relationship with Jane, another internal problem, will Jane stay with Tarzan or will Tarzan leave with Jane? And with all else happening, the filmmakers had to throw in a villain: Clayton. See what we are dealing with here, one of these stories is enough, but we need not to see every one of them in full, for I was baffled at this film's childish yet complicated plot.The only reason why the above fault didn't totally wreak this movie is because each of the ""mini-movies"" is connected with somewhat of a ""through-line,"" a basis for story telling that connects events together. ""Tarzan"" smartly conceives a firm plot in which one happening leads to another.Another problem with the film is the villain, Clayton, who has no characteristics about him that make him overly nasty, aggressive, evil or memorable. Think of  Jafar from ""Aladdin"" and Gaston from ""Beauty and the Beast.""The animation in ""Tarzan"" is a breathtaking visual exhilaration. The scenes where Tarzan surfs though the trees and swings on stretchy vines are wonderful. The colors are well chosen, and the film seems well directed.""Tarzan"" has enough good filmmaking in it to please the majority of an audience. But if you want to see a movie with high standards and true morals go see ""Instinct,"" which like ""Tarzan"" details a character who feels different from the rest of us. But unlike ""Tarzan,"" that film was precise in it characters, plot, and  concepts for that it is possible to live in harmony with a different species. ""Tarzan"" only delivers the stale wish that there are answers out there.",Tarzan
55,alice liddell,"Maddening, but brilliant (possible spoiler)",8,8 December 1999,"A mediocre film in Disney's history, but absolutely brilliant in the context of 1999.  Gleefully violent and filled with shocking innuendo, the plot makes up for neglible plotting with the almost BAMBIesque creation of a believable anthropomorphic universe.  The animated movement is sublime, and makes almost all live action films look clunky; the colour and characterisation is a pleasure - the death of Clayton is one of the best things ever in Disney.  There are the usual complaints - hair-pulling score, neo-fascist bildungsroman narrative; the muddled conservatism that confuses distrust of patriarchy and celebration of matriarchy with dollops of Social Darwinism.  Worst of all is the idea of a Disney film railing against cultural exploitation.  This mixture of squirm-inducing ideology and breathless aesthetic joy makes for a very disturbing viewing experience.",Tarzan

I you like this movie then i am pretty sure  you will like Tarzan and Jane because that concludes the next part of  Tarzan of what he gets up to this time in the jungle and what missions  he does. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i think it's brilliant.  I hope they will make a 3rd Tarzan movie, it would be great to see  Tarzan as a daddy. Who know what the future will hold, i hope there  will be another movie because Tarzan is so cool.",Tarzan
57,Min111,Tarzan of the Jungle,10,16 December 2019,"'Tarzan' was the last of these many great Disney movies we've been blessed with in the nineties. Before 'Tarzan', you had Disney movies such as 'Hercules' and 'Mulan'. It's hard to choose the best one, but I think they were all good. I was upset when you find out the fate of Tarzan's parents. They were killed by Sabor who is an aggressive, dangerous, destructive and ferocious wild leopard. I really hate Sabor for what he/she has done. 'Tarzan' was an infant. Kala, who's a female gorilla, who recently lost her own child to Sabor, finds the infant, and takes him back to the jungle. She raises the infant as her own. Kala names him 'Tarzan'. I was hoping his parents would be alive still. 'Tarzan' would've been a lot better had his parents stayed alive I reckon. Sabor is unable to speak, and is well-known throughout the jungle. Again, 'Tarzan' would've been more better if Sabor was able to speak just like the rest of the animals. These are the few things the movie should've gotten right. Anyway, Sabor, though, never backs down from a fight. Amazingly! Sabor has lived a remarkably long life for a leopard until what 'Tarzan' does to her or him. I'm glad 'Tarzan' kills her/him. Sabor's gender is actually unknown. Sabor is one of the main antagonists of 'Tarzan'. The other main antagonist is a man named Clayton who's from England. He's one of the more underrated Disney villains. I like Clayton's appearance. The guy also uses a shotgun. He plans to attack and seize the gorillas. He plans to be wealthy by selling gorillas on the black market. I like how Clayton never shows any signs of cowardice. In fact, when he's cornered with his own shotgun, he's far from begging for his life, and even mocks 'Tarzan' to pull the trigger. This is what makes Clayton such a terrific Disney villain. 'Tarzan' rescues a woman explorer named Jane Porter who's here on an expedition with her father. They're looking to study gorillas. This is where 'Tarzan' finds out he's a human after meeting Jane where both of them fall in love. They were meant. He now has to make a decision where he should belong. I liked how Kala takes 'Tarzan' to the treehouse where she found him as an infant, and shows him his true past. It's emotional. I really wanted 'Tarzan' to be with his caring, loving and protective parents. Why did they have to die? The movie can make you cry. Let's not forget the other characters such as Terk and Tantor who are Tarzan's friends. Terk is a gorilla, and Tantor is a elephant. There's also a gorilla named Kerchak who's Kala's mate. 'Tarzan', however, finds himself treated differently by the gorillas because of the way he looks. So he makes an effort to fit in with them. I liked how 'Tarzan' managed to defeat Clayton's men, and free the gorillas. Clayton, however, manages to shoot Kerchak. I like how Kerchak accepts 'Tarzan' as his son in the end, and makes him the leader of the gorillas. 'Tarzan' is a movie that can trigger your emotions. Very emotional. This is something other Disney movies are unable to provide. 'Tarzan' is unique. These Disney movies get the highest of ratings.",Tarzan
58,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,31 March 2021,"After an accident at sea, which causes a ship to sink on the coast of Africa, an English couple finds a way to go to the beach with their son, a newborn. However, the parents are killed by a leopard, while the baby is left to fend for themselves. The child is found by a gorilla, Kala, the companion of Kerchak, the leader of the tribe of monkeys. Kerchak is surprised by the abandoned child and wants him to be left in the jungle. On the other hand, Kala's maternal nature is touched, not to mention her memories of having lost her own child. Kala and Kerchak stay with the baby and give him the name Tarzan, who is raised with the other monkeys. Tarzan grows up to become an adult, until his life is changed forever with the arrival of Archimedes Q. Porter, an explorer, along with Jane Porter, his daughter, and Clayton, a hunter who is serving as a guide. Archimedes and Jane went to Africa to study wildlife in their natural habitat, although Clayton prefers to imprison as many gorillas as possible, as each is worth three hundred pounds. When the explorers find Tarzan, they think of the principle that they discovered the missing link, but soon realize that he is as human as they are. Tarzan finds himself torn between his desire to be with people of his kind, in addition to the new and little-known emotions he feels towards Jane, and his loyalty to the gorilla family that raised him, especially when Clayton doesn't see monkeys as friends but as prey.Film reviewed on March 31, 2021.",Tarzan
59,meydiana-65242,"Wow!! An 11 out of 10, if possible... ... or no, a 15, maybe.",10,19 October 2020,"This is right up there with 'The Lion King' and 'Mulan'. I had the treat to see this last night, and through it all, even the toddlers in the theater loved it! People have said this is a breakthrough animation-wise, but story-wise, this is like mind-blowing. Tarzan himself is the first truly deep Disney male character since ... I can't think of a really deep Disney male character, except perhaps Simba from The Lion King. Tarzan has everything that makes you realize that, though he's raised by apes, he's truly human, and even his upbringing can't hide that (C'mon, if you were raised your whole life thinking you were an ape, and then suddenly find out you're really something else, wouldn't you also be disturbed?)From the first to the last scene was awesome. Tarzan and the ape Kala's backgrounds were told briefly, poignantly, and emotionally. There's (intelligent) humor and love, which only add to the film, and there's an obvious love between Tarzan and Jane. Someone here said they're not in love, that it's obvious, but I have to strongly disagree. The scenes between them are funny and give you a feeling that there's a strong attraction (and not just because Jane's interested in studying apes). And even Jane's father, though he's a small background character, he helps the plot along, and while you'd describe him as ""dithering"", he has his own funny bone (When Jane is describing Tarzan to him by drawing a picture on a blackboard, she starts to go on about his 'wonderful eyes', and in the midst of her daydream, her father comments, ""Would you like me to give you and the blackboard some private time?"" Riot!).No, Clayton's not a Jafar or a Gaston, but he's not really the enemy here; he's just an antagonist to help along Tarzan's inner conflict. The real enemy would be Tarzan's battling against his 'true' world (the one with humans) and the one he's grown up with (the one with apes). Clayton just resembles a threat to Tarzan's ape family. In the past, villains were a direct challenge to the hero; here, he is a threat, sure, but he's not the whole movie here. I like it better this way. In real life, there's rarely a big evil soul against you, and Clayton seems like a realistic greedy, nasty guy, rather than the cliche megolamincal weirdos of most animated features.I loved Phil Collins. And while it's great hearing Ariel sing, I think background music was better for this particular movie. I couldn't see Jane or Tarzan singing; it makes the whole thing almost unrealistic.Tarzan himself was wonderful! Charismatic, emotional, outgoing, and at the same time, goofy and boyish. The scenes between him and his ape mother, Kala, were so tender. I haven't seen such wonderful emotions in live-action movies. And even Kerchak ... let me tell you something about him. Even my mom said he was real. I don't think he was too mean. He felt threatened by Tarzan's presence. It wasn't out of superiority. When Kala first shows baby Tarzan to him, Kerchak is worried about the existence of other humans in the jungle, which might endanger his family of apes. He only worries about his family, too, and I suspect that, while he keeps a stoic face over the death of his own baby ape in the beginning of the movie, he's not ready to adopt another baby (if one of your kids died, would you be so willing to adopt another right away? I know I wouldn't).The Lion King, Mulan, and Tarzan all have the same thing in common; they all show true emotion and character, unlike the basic fairy tale fluff like Cinderella and Bambi (nothing against fairy tales, but I like to see true-to-life stuff, you know?).This is a must-see. If Disney keeps this up, adults may start to change their views of animated stuff. It ain't just for lil' kids anymore! :)",Tarzan

From the little mermaid to beauty and the beast, from Aladdin to the lion king, from Pocahontas to Hercules, and finally, Mulan to Tarzan, these movies still hold their staying power to today. However, Tarzan was the last of these films, from the period known as the Disney Renaissance. Disney remains a popular animation studio in the public eye, but no one could deny how popular they were throughout the 1990s.Tarzan itself is based upon the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and the movies from the 1930s. Tarzan is a baby who loses his parents, and is adopted by a family of gorillas, who raise him up as their own.For a Disney film, this one is one of the best. For a renaissance film, It's not the best of them. I still like to say that the first 2 (The Little Mermaid & Beauty and the Beast) were the best.

Not even Johnny Weismuller could execute the moves that the animated Tarzan does, and Weismuller is the best Tarzan!  Disney's version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs story brings a grand, lush visual splendor to the jungle that can only be seen in animation.  What's nice about this Disney adventure is the fact that the characters do not break out into song.  Phil Collins' songs reinforce the images on the screen and do not intrude on the narrative.  The film is light on its feet and hits all the right buttons.  The vocal casting is good.  Lance Henrikson brings the right amount of menace to Kerchek and Minnie Driver was perfectly cast as Jane.  As stated before, the film is animated in a lush manner that no live action film could accomplish easily.

None of the characters are memorable and the scene where the apes play with the pots and pans is a ""Jungle Book"" ripoff. Even Phil Collins couldn't help this movie.And did anyone notice the poor quality of colors they used in this movie. This is the only Disney movie that, to me, looked like a cheap cartoon they usually play on some low budget TV network. It was really bad. And it's not just this movie. Check out ""The Whole Nine Yards"" or ""Sixth Day"" or some other movie I can't think of right now and you'll get the general idea. As if they were using some new cheap cameras that totally ruin the ""magic of colors"". Now there's a technical term for you! I am of course speaking in layman's terms but the point I'm trying to make is that these movies are not watchable. But let's get back to Tarzan.

67,TaylorYee94,I respect how Disney respects the nature in 'Tarzan'.,8,23 December 2020,"The way 'Tarzan' portrays the nature (both in form and in content) deserves compliments.The whole narrative happens in one setting: the jungle; therefore, the importance of the reality of this setting is huge. Sketches, animation, and colors are all beautiful to look at. Depicting how the trees wave in the wind, how the water ripples when the elephants stump on it, and how tree branches and leaves move when Tarzan and Jane walk the jungle is more complicated and detailed than that of human characters. The animation team of 'Tarzan' does the job right to convey the beauty of the nature to the audience.'Tarzan' sends out clear and strong message that the nature is not owned by human. This philosophical message and how each character approaches the difference between the nature and the human are more interesting and thought-provoking than the romance between Tarzan and Jane (even though they are such an adorable couple). At the end, Jane and Dr. Porter going back to the jungle symbolizes that the two can be different, but they can also co-exist. The scene when Porters meet gorillas for the first time is filled with love and respect: how Jane waits till they open up to her first, values their boundaries, and learns their language.It's not just 'Tarzan'. Among Disney Renaissance movies (except for Mulan), my favorites are 'The Lion King', 'Pocahontas', and 'Tarzan'. These three movies show the same respect for the nature & natural order and deeper messages than princesses' romance.P.S.

72,renegadeviking-271-528568,Tarzan,7,4 February 2020,"Known as the last of the classics from the Disney Renaissance, Tarzan was released June 18, 1999 as Disney's 37th animated motion picture. It was the first Disney animated film to open in theaters at #1 since Pocahontas (1995) and the most expensive made until Treasure Planet (2002). Interestingly, it is also the only completed animated adaption of Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs and is perhaps the most successful of all the Tarzan adaptations.Though incredibly expensive to make, Tarzan stands out as one of the greatest of all the Disney films not only because of its incredible animation, screenplay and stylization but also because of its the complicated message.To be honest, I am not a huge fan of the original Tarzan novels. To me, a man growing up wild in the jungle isn't as romantic as its seems. However, I think that Disney took a popularized story and changed it into something equal to the original novel. What made it so wonderful was the heart that Tarzan's creators put into its production, story, music, backgrounds and character design.The original story, published first in 1914 through a series of magazine articles, also takes place in Africa but instead tells the story of John Clayton. He was adopted by the gorilla Kala, after his mother died of an illness and his father was killed by the ape leader Kerchak, and was named Tarzan or ""white skin"" in the ape language.Subsequently, he adapts to his environment and struggles with his feelings of isolation. Rather than being a story of acceptance, family and love it instead played homage to the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin with themes specifically deriving from his theory of natural selection. Created in the heart of the earliest stages of film production, Burough's Tarzan has been adapted and re-adapted into film over 200 times. What is it about this story that intrigued readers and watchers so intently? Most likely it was the introduction of something completely foreign and mysterious that caught Westerner's attention. Almost like the horrifying creature from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), Tarzan in his primal masculinity became a legend unto himself.Since I saw Tarzan in theaters as a child, I have loved it just as adamantly as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Now that I am an adult, I think my admiration for the film and its production has changed, though my childhood love for its characters and story has not. I became interested in doing a review of this movie for several reasons, however the clincher was the release of the spectacular short video Duet by one of Tarzan's original character designers Glen Keane. Needless to say, I became VERY interested in Glen Keane's other work and set off to learn everything I could about him.It is a funny thing really because I have never particularly paid attention to the small details in character design and backgrounds until about two years ago when I saw Princess Mononoke (1997). What really intrigued me about Hayao Miyazaki's epic masterpiece was how he personally overlooked the production of over 140,000 cels of his film (which he wrote, story boarded, and directed) of which he redrew about 80,000 himself. Anyway, my love for hand draw animation was set aflame and I have become fascinated with the entire process.Tarzan begins with two contrasting couples raising their newly born children in the wilds of Africa: one a human couple, stranded by a terrible storm and the other native gorillas. Both though initially different are shown to have struggles, loss and intimate familial bonding. After Kala and Kerchak (gorillas) lost their baby to the female leopard Sabor, Kala follows the cries of child to the house built by Tarzan's parents and finds both the remains of his parents and the infant alone in a makeshift cradle. She saves him from Sabor and adopts him as her son Tarzan, though Kerchak refuses to acknowledge him.As he grows, Tarzan struggles with his differences from the other gorillas and resolves, after a close encounter with a herd of elephants and Kerchak's scathing reproach, to do everything he can to become stronger and be accepted by his family. By the time he is twenty years old, he has learned to adapt to his environment remarkably well even to the point where he kills Sabor, saving Kerchak and protecting his family.His whole world changes however when a group of humans wanders into the jungles and he saves one of them, Jane Porter, from a group of angry group of baboons. Against Kerchak's orders, he continues to interact with them, learning English, about the outside world and falls in love with Jane.When it becomes apparent that they, specifically Jane, would be leaving back for England, Clayton convinces Tarzan to lead them to his family though he knows it would endanger them and put his family at risk. Once he saves them from Kerchak's wrath Kala takes Tarzan back to the house where she found him and he decides to leave with Jane and the others for England. However, it turns sour when Clayton reveals his plans to capture the gorillas and sell them on the black market. Once Tarzan saves his family he is given charge when Kerchak dies from a gunshot wound. In the end Jane and her father stay with him and his pack and the film finishes showing all of them as they have adapted to their surroundings.I said before that I believe that this film is equal to the original novel. The defining reason why is because of its depth and emotionality, with its heavy emphasis on family and self-perception. At its heart, it strives to answer Tarzan's emotional question to Kerchak after he discovers that there are others like him: ""Why are you threatened by anyone different than you?"". It seems strange to see Tarzan seen as inferior by his family when in reality gorillas are perceived as more primitive by human beings.Another essential component that made this movie unique was the music done by Phil Collins. It is rather strange that they chose a contemporary artist to do almost all of its songs, yet it fit Tarzan's atmosphere nicely. I liked how well he worked with its instrumental score, written by Mark Mancina, and the feeling he put into each of the song's creation.What is also interesting about this film is how little dialogue there is compared to other Disney classics. It takes its time to show the audience intricate scenes of the jungle and its action scenes don't rely heavily on unneeded lines. In other words, the movie speaks for itself in its design and execution.In the film's production, Disney animators and story boarders went to Africa and took thousands of pictures of the jungle's vegetation, animals and scenery in order to capture the true essence of Tarzan's world. To ensure this, they developed a film technique ""Deep canvas"", where those who designed the backgrounds painted 3D images on a computer {Like painting a whole branch rather than just one visible side} which allowed them to show intricate scenes like Tarzan and Jane's flight from the baboons.When I watched it several weeks ago, I was awed by the beautiful painted backgrounds I had never had the mind to study. Honestly, it would be impossible to accomplish in a live-action film what they were able to in this movie. As the famous film critic Roger Ebert put it, ""It has scenes that move through space with a freedom undreamed of in older animated films, and unattainable by any live-action process."" That is what is so amazing about animation; it allows us to take our dreams and put them in a moving, artistic medium. How else would we be able to have movies like The Little Mermaid (1989) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004)?Glen Keane, who I mentioned earlier as my inspiration for this review, was in charge of Tarzan's adult design and conception. He insisted on using Disney's studio in France in order, with their superior knowledge of the human body (specifically the muscular system), to capture a definitive recreation of Tarzan. This decision is probably why Tarzan is one of the most memorable characters in animated history, at least for me.His design is definitely stunning and its shows that creating an animated film on Tarzan's level is a complicated and rigorous process. I look at it this way; it is like taking Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam (whose knowledge of the human body and the muscular system was EXTRAORDINARY) and redrawing it thousands of times in multiple angles and perspectives. Characters like the gorillas and various other animals were given the same attention by designers in The Lion King (1994), who had brought in live lions to the studio.Another interesting thing to note is the shape of the character's eyes, enlarged in order to emphasize emotions and expressions {Not unlike techniques incorporated by the Japanese}.Like in most of my favorite movies, Tarzan and Jane's romance is partly why I love this film. I like simple romances. More accurately, I like seeing the purity and joy that comes when two people truly love one another. Unlike in the original novel, Tarzan and Jane were given the chance to be together. What made their relationship so special is hard to explain. To put it simply, it was as if two kindred spirits, lost in their own way and unable to truly express themselves, were brought together and freed. In other words, they complimented one another.Without question my favorite scene is ""Strangers Like Me"" as it shows how they slowly drew closer to one another. Without any dialogue, it captured their growth together and how their worlds opened as their relationship progressed. Though Jane had many things to show and teach Tarzan, that didn't mean that he couldn't do the same for her. In one specific clip, Tarzan gently pushed her to swing on a vine, the exhilaration.",Tarzan
73,deexsocalygal,Would've been better without Phil Collins & Rosie O'Donnell music,3,17 October 2020,"Tarzan is not a very good Disney film. I give it a 3. I have major complaints: First, in my opinion, the Phil Collins songs were NOT a good fit. His music pulled me out of the movie, made me scowl, & think ""What the heck?!"" I don't ever want the soundtrack to pull me out of the wonderful mesmerized mood Disney movies always put me in. Phil Collins is way too modern for Tarzan. I turned the volume way down whenever his songs came on.Second: Rosie O'Donnell. Rosie has a harsh Brooklyn, NY accent. It's a jarring distraction that doesn't fit Tarzan. Here we see the old Victorian style dress, gloves, tea pots, & hear the old English accents of the explorers as they talk amongst themselves. Then we switch over to the Gorillas & we hear Rosie's Brooklyn accent? It doesn't fit.Third, Terk's personality doesn't fit into a nature story of long ago. Here we are back in time in the old Victorian era & they made the young gorillas in the jungle hard, unfriendly, inner city youths with New York accents trying to be cool & making it hard on Tarzan to get into their GANG. Tarzan even had to pass an ""initiation"" like real gangs have to do in order to hang out with the other gorilla kids.Fourth, I didn't like that there wasn't any meaningful scenes with any of the other animals that live in the jungle. There are thousands of creatures & insects in the jungle but all we see are monkeys & elephants. Too much time was spent on mean-spirited unfriendly young gorilla gangs.Fifth, I think it would of been a better fit if Disney would of stayed family oriented & focused on Tarzan's immediate family of gorillas - mother, father, brothers, sisters, grandmother, grandfather. Scenes of them interacting amongst themselves as a family.I was counting on seeing some scenes of Tarzan with big snakes, huge spiders, scorpions, crocodiles, & hippos!! There was one scene of Tarzan fighting a leopard that was okay & a very very short - maybe 2 minutes - dull forgetable clip of him with a snake.",Tarzan

77,fjhuerta-2,"Anaheim, we have a problem.",6,21 October 2000,"I am afraid Disney is losing its movie making magic.A couple of months ago I went to Disneyland with a couple of friends (30ish, I myself am 25), and had the time of my life. We all agreed this place had a strange magic in it, a redeeming quality that went beyond its 100 acre site and went deep into your subconscious. We were grinning the minute we went in, and we were still like that 12 hours later. We went 2 days in a row to the park, and we were delighted.  OTOH, we all think Disney World is the blandest, most artificial theme park ever.Tarzan, Pocahontas, Hunchback and everything else after ""Lion King"" seems to be like Disney World to me. Excess, excess (CGI animation, hyper-expensive songs by worn-out semi-pop stars (Phil Collins? how can you have Elton John do ""Lion King"" and then Phil Collins???), an ultra-expensive cast) doesn't mean a good movie. Beauty and the Beast is a hauntingly beautiful movie. Lion King is a very good movie. Tarzan is not.The only hope I still have is that the Disney Studios sometimes release very, very good stuff (Toy Story 2 has to be the best animated feature I've ever seen in my life). Sadly, people seem to ignore them in favor of the commercial, ""safe"" features.I can only hope my kids can still see Disneyland the way my grandmother, my mother and myself saw it. Yet, Disney wants to corrupt this park, too. Have you seen ""California Adventure"", the new park opposite Disneyland? The Disney people seem only to care about money nowadays.Needless to say, Walt wouldn't be proud.",Tarzan
78,FairlyAnonymous,"Animation is its strongest point, plot is not",6,22 March 2015,"Tarzan is a beautifully animated film (or at least the hand-drawn segments, but we will get to that later) and it has some of the fastest and most fluid movement from a Disney film in a very long time. The action and the pacing is very nice and the colors are all very vibrant, with very nice shading to boot. The human characters are also half of the fun of this movie. Just the way they move and how fast everyone interacts with each other is entertaining.However, Tarzan is not without some fairly major flaws.The biggest problem is the movie's plot. I know this is going off of some old material, but they aren't even following the original story very closely so it could've been improved. You can see where the movie is going almost a mile away and it has the same old cliché: ""I'm a protective father who is super conservative and old fashioned and won't risk my people for your ways"" kind of deal. This kind of thing has been done more frequently AFTER this film was released, but it wasn't an uncommon theme beforehand... I mean... Pocahontas. And of course you know Tarzan is going to do something that will make everyone mad at him, but then Tarzan will have to redeem himself and... you get the drift. Fortunately, this movie is so fast paced that it doesn't even get caught in those boring details and these clichés wizz by super fast. All in all, Tarzan's plot is very weak and the bad guy is... hilariously obvious and I'm even more surprised that Jane and her father didn't even notice how obsessed he was with gorillas... not even slightly suspicious. Overall, I like Clayton's design and his character, but he isn't a truly deep or interesting villain.Regardless of the villain, the other characters have a lot of issues. Almost every character in this movie is a one-dimensional or a two-dimensional character. You have some depth with Tarzan, and maybe a little bit with Jane, but because the movie thinks that montages are equivalent to character development, you never really get any on- screen development. You see the characters before and after the development, but rarely during. This hurts Jane's and Tarzan's relationship the most. In Aladdin it kind of worked because Jasmine already kind of liked Aladdin and recognized that it was probably him. They already had chemistry between each other and they sang a duet. However, when the Tarzan equivalent is a montage and the only romantic part is roughly 20 seconds long... you have almost no chemistry.All of the human characters seemed to have been cast fairly well (not sure about Tarzan, but he sounds fine) but a lot of the animal characters sound... not like their animated characters. Tarzan's ""father"" has a voice that sounds a little too high and clear for someone who is supposed to be a massive, giant, powerful gorilla. Terk's gender is almost impossible to tell until you watch the movie long enough. Almost everyone I know who has seen this movie thought Terk was a boy. And there are a couple of other examples of voices that don't seem to fit their characters.The hand-drawn animation in this movie is fantastic. There is no arguing it is some of Disney's best as far as individual characters go. However, almost everything outside of the characters is CGI or painted background... on a CGI plane. This sounds like a minor complaint, but it becomes rather annoying when you start to feel like you are watching a CGI film with hand-drawn characters instead of a hand-drawn film with CGI elements. Now, regarding the soundtrack... this is probably the most infamous aspect of this movie... the Phil Collins soundtrack. Don't get me wrong, there are MOMENTS in the songs that work perfectly with the visual imagery. There are times where the music lines up with the atmosphere but... it sounds so ridiculous and over the top that it makes it hard to take the movie seriously. This is much like the voice-casting of the movie: In some areas it works, in other areas it makes absolutely no sense.That actually sums up the movie pretty well: A movie that knows what it is doing in some areas, and has absolutely no idea in other areas. Certain scenes/songs come completely out of nowhere and are merely filler, almost all character development happens over montages, the animation is split between CGI and hand-drawn, half of the characters are voiced nicely while the other half aren't, and sometimes the movie is nicely paced while other times it is incredibly rushed. This is a movie that could've been much more entertaining than it was and much more interesting, but it falls into so many clichés and generic story-telling elements that it doesn't feel like a really special film.",Tarzan
79,Mitch-38,Great animation...So-so story,7,5 February 2000,"The animation has the Disney magic, the awesome technological and artistic talent we've come to expect for decades. Yet, with such an oft told story, it comes off as lame as your standard ""knock-knock joke"" fare.     Truly, bringing to life a story that's been around for a hundred years or so; takes a bit of a trick to breathe new life into. After all, the popular novel and its sequels. The cartoon strip, the endless series of motion pictures (silent and sound, black and white and color), the tv series...on and on. If anyone could pull it off, one would think the Disney studios could. Well, ""...there is no joy in Mudville..."", folks.
    The environmental message, the easy going charm, the finely tuned expressions of the characters are all there...just nothing really new. The hidden (""wink-wink"") humor to entertain the parents, which usually rescues adults from groaning through 2 hours of the normal kiddie fare, is also sorely lacking. The music did help, and was one of the picture's highlights. Unfortunately, that weighed against the predictability of the plot, the inaneness of some of the characters and the last second resolution of the differences between Tarzan and his adopted father really dull the senses.
    These are the kind of issues that separate great movies from the average.",Tarzan

However, it's a Disney movie and so I accept some fiction in their reality.The film basically consists of a baby boy who is raised in the jungle and becomes a jungle crazy type guy. He is named Tarzan. Soon humans come to check out the animals and he ends up interacting with them.The only thing I found odd was that he and the girl somehow fell in love so quickly without knowing anything about each other. Sure, it's possible to fall in love at first site, but a shirtless guy from the jungle whom I'm sure smelled a lot worse than we see on TV.But anyway, that's my only real gripe on the movie, if anything.I rate this 8/10.",Tarzan
82,PCC0921,A nice entry in the Tarzan mythos.,8,13 October 2020,"Disney brings out a nice story that follows the mythos of Tarzan quite well. How he was lost in the jungle, taken in by apes and there is Jane too. It is a film that bridges the gap between kid friendly and adult situations. Young and old alike can enjoy this one. Another good thing about it is the fact that the story stays in Africa so you do not have to worry about our hero going to Manhattan or something silly like that. It is complete with precision animation, colorful characters and a good cast.

I was thrilled.The way violence was handled was brilliant -- there was never any blood -- except in one of the very early scenes and it would be missed by most people.All death was handled discretely -- with all of it happening off screen -- with one exception.This movie may be too intense for young children but I highly recommend it for adults.",Tarzan

87,C22Man,Strangers like me,7,9 October 2015,"Tarzan is considered to be the final film of the 'Disney Renaissance'. It's hard to argue with that, as it was the studios last big box office hit and widely acclaimed film for a number of years. It is also a story that is perfectly tailored to Disney's style given its strong underlying themes and emotive characters. Importantly it understands the key aspects within the story as it provides a lot of feeling and intrigue to what is a straight-forward story. Tarzan's parents are killed in the jungle, he is raised by apes and he later battles the feelings that he doesn't belong with them. It is rather bare when you look at it like that, but Disney knows that what is important is seeing these characters grow and change through the challenges put in their way. Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn) himself is near perfect. He's kind, he's curious, he's smart, but he is also very much human and makes mistakes in realising that. He is someone that we can get behind and care about. Seeing him grow throughout the film and become more ape- like whilst becoming less human is really engaging. You do feel for him and connect with his struggle of getting his adoptive father to accept him as his own. I wasn't a fan of the stuff with the young Tarzan, but once he gets older the story keeps on becoming more interesting as we see Tarzan questioning who he is.The other characters are good too. Jane is just fantastic. She takes such joy from the little details, has plenty of funny moments and Minnie Driver does a superb job. Plus I found the romance between her and Tarzan very believable, more than I can say for many Disney efforts. Kala (Glenn Close) is nicely sympathetic and her bond with Tarzan is well developed, while Karchak has legitimate reasons for his hostility and Lance Henriksen is excellent as always. Clayton is a slightly weak villain and another who is just after money (which is a bit of a cop-out), but Brian Blessed's booming voice gives the character something of an edge. The professor (Nigel Hawthorne) gets some funny lines too. The animation is just spectacular. To see Tarzan effectively surf across the trees and vines is wonderful to see. What impresses me is how well the animation flows because at times it moves so quickly, especially in those surfing scenes. The jungle setting lends itself to some creative visuals too. There's some fabulous action sequences too that are always full of energy and really suspenseful, especially with the climax. The story is told relatively serious which is a suitable for a story like this. The comic relief can feel out of place but it is mostly kept to a minimum and most of the humour simply comes from the situations.The music is simply brilliant. I'm not a big fan of Phil Collins, but the songs here are really good songs and the lyrics perfectly convey the emotions that Tarzan is going through like they should. 'Two Worlds' and 'Strangers Like Me' are especially good. They might get in the way for some, but for me they were really impressive and never felt out of place. Of course the film isn't without flaws. Though Tarzan's dilemma is addressed, I would have liked to see the film look deeper into his problems. I also found characters like Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) rather annoying and not really needed. Plus I wish the cheetah that killed Tarzan's parents was given more of a story, he could have been a great obstacle for Tarzan to overcome given the personal history.Tarzan is a very impressive piece from Disney and it knows exactly where to keep its focus. It crafts a character that the audience cares about and puts him through a journey that we want to see the outcome of. I enjoyed how serious the story was kept and how the relationships between the characters felt real. It isn't perfect and stumbles at times, but its heart is always in the right place and when it works it is frequently brilliant. I like the characters, the animation is just great and the music is really effective. Tarzan is a worthy take on a well-known story, frequently striking a chord and doing what Disney do best.",Tarzan

Goldwyn supplies a nice voice of Tarzan, Knight and O'Donnell supply appealing kids voices, Driver gives a nice British standoff as Jane, Close was good as the motherly Kala, and Hawthorne didn't seem so bad as Professor Porter.  An amazing thing also is that the animation is top notch from the usual bunch as we see panoramic views of Tarzan swinging and surfing through vines.  There are many things that made this movie also different.  There isn't much musical interludes like the usual (total in movie: 3). It seemed pretty violent, like the fight against a leopard or blood of a mauling of parents.  Then there's the haunting figure of a man's shadow that looks like he was hung.

91,DanB-4,One of Disney's Best,8,25 July 1999,"The true measure of a family film is to watch a child's reaction. My (normally jumpy) three-year-old sat with enraptured glee through this movie and was able to articulate the plot back to me with amazing detail. That's not a parent's rambling, its a credit to a brilliant movie. Tarzan ranks just below Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid in the list of the best of Disney's new films.Disney formula (rogue orphan, evil villain pretending to be a friend, whacky sidekick, neurotic friend and lots a snappy tunes) has never been more apparent, but it works perfectly. But the real joy of this movie is its breathtaking beauty and the message of living without prejudice.Don't expect anything new from Disney, and do not expect a detailed retelling of the original novel. But do expect to see their product refined even further and at its best since Beauty and the Beast. This is a kid's movie, but any grown-up can like it. Minnie Driver and Wayne Knight provide the best voice overs.As my six-year-old daughter told me once, ""I like movies with scary beginnings, silly middles and happy endings.""

92,datautisticgamer-74853,Little more than top-tier emotion and intensity,7,11 May 2016,"Tarzan is officially the final film in the Disney Renaissance, made in a time when CGI movies were becoming the hottest thing since the founding of Disney parody sites on the internet (okay, maybe that didn't happen in 1999, but you should see my point), continuing to be strong at the box office like the films before it. There are a good amount of reasons as to why, such as having some unsettlingly awesome action between Tarzan, Sabor, and Clayton, one of the most horrifying and scarring villain deaths, and plenty of emotion. The sad thing is, most of it is in the prologue and epilogue acts, with Tarzan's childhood (which spawned one of the cartoon universe's most unwarranted sequels) and adolescence being rather ho-hum. There is some humor to lighten it all up, but it once again works about half the time and, wisely, comes during child Tarzan scenes when we know that Tarzan is still puerile.

I usually don't like movies, that have songs in them,especially animated movies, but Tarzan is one exception.Being a big fan of Phil Collins, I really loved this movie. The story is great, and the voice talents are superb.**Spoilers ahead**Tarzan is found by Kala (voice of Glenn Close), who saves him from a evil leopard, Sabor. Sabor had killed Tarzan's parents, who had been shipwrecked on Africa.Kala, along with Terk, a young female gorilla, take care of Tarzan.As an adult, Tarzan discovers humans in the jungle. Until then, he had never seen another human before. (Except his parents, but he was only a baby at the time that they were killed.) He learns more about them, and is betrayed by one of them, Clayton, who has an evil plot to capture the gorillas and use them for various things.The songs were written and performed by Phil Collins. His score is also done really well.The interesting thing about this movie is that it has 6 deaths. More than any other Disneyy film. I won't name the deaths, because it would be a big spoiler.My Score: 8/10",Tarzan
95,Jaime N. Christley,Minnie Driver,7,29 July 1999,"It's possible that not even Disney, with seventy-plus years experience in the animation industry, and all their money, can ever create an animated figure that is as dynamic as Minnie Driver is an actress.  Jane seems to be moving too slow and her mouth is out of synch with Driver's.  I can almost see the Disney animators, struggling feverishly to catch up with all of Driver's little nuances, all the little spins she puts on ordinary words, that irresistible little giggle, the ""useless"" words (conjunctions, pronouns, adverbs, etc.) that she slurs together as if they were one sound. She's more animated than animation.",Tarzan
96,pied,Top-rated entertainment; perfect for entire family!,10,6 July 1999,"Perfect animated film featuring the Tarzan story by Edgar Rice Burroughs which Disney faithfully adapts.  Much better than the hybrid ""Hunchback"" or the depressing ""Pocohantas,"" Tarzan scores a 10 in my book.  The scenery is breathtaking, making the African jungle realistic and beautiful. The characters are perfectly portrayed--Tarzan, Jane, Cerchak (the silver-striped leader of the gorillas) Tarzan's mother, his chums.The story is exciting, and the animation is simply marvelous.  The audience spontaneously applauded afterwards.  I loved it!",Tarzan
97,justbob1982,One of the weaker Disney films,6,31 December 2014,"Version: UK bluray releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 4/10Overall: 6/10Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan has become a very cinematic legend over the century since his first story was published but, for me, the Disney version comes during one of the dips in the quality of their output. Their initial Golden Age ended with the Jungle Book, followed by a revival during the 80s and 90s. More recently, they've come back to the top again with The Princess and the Frog, Tangled and Frozen.It's interesting that both the directors of Tarzan were involved with this latest renaissance: Chris Buck co-directed Frozen (with Jennifer Lee), and Kevin Lima got it all started with Enchanted, which re-assessed the glittering Disney back-catalogue, and came away with an attitude that was affectionate, yes, but not actually reverential. Sadly, there is little evidence in Tarzan of that healthier relationship with the legacy.The setting is a problem, for me. I grew up with Disney films that each had a distinctive setting, be it Arabia or under the sea. However, The Jungle Book had already covered, erm, jungle, and The Lion King had done Africa. An adult perception says that the African jungle is distinct from both of these, but Disney are not about adult, subtle distinctions.Another problem with Tarzan is the soundtrack. I found Phil Collins' voice dull and detached throughout, and when I bothered to tune into the lyrics, they just explained what I could already see was going on on-screen, thus making them pointless. Okay, they got Elton John in to make good songs for The Lion King, and there are versions sung by him, but they are distinctly poorer in my book, and in the main film I am glad they stuck with the cast as singers.The animation is pretty good for the period, especially in the sequences where Tarzan is racing through the branches... although they are also suspiciously reminiscent of a roller-coaster ride, coming from the company that must always be on the lookout for new Disneyland attractions. The movements of Tarzan and his ape 'family' are also well-observed, I was pleased to note.Such a shame, then, that the character of Tarzan himself (as voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is so unengaging. I'm not sure why it is; he certainly has enough character drama, what with an identity crisis and overall coming-of-age in classic film style. Maybe it's because they have set aside the traditional Tarzan symbol of masculinity in favour of something more vulnerable and adolescent; a defensible choice, but one that requires real attention to detail to instigate. He just didn't quite grab me... in stark contrast to his love interest, Jane (Minnie Driver). Driver was at the height of her powers back in 1999, and brings to the role the confidence of an actress in charge of her destiny. She has so much more screen magnetism and, quite frankly, I would have preferred it if she had just been the main character throughout. Maybe Tarzan's development would have been more interesting through her eyes.Oh, and TWENTY-ONE story writers! What's that all about? There's barely enough story here for one writer, once you take out the contributions of Burroughs and the screenwriters. It would appear that they just gave a writing credit to everyone who did some work on designing the characters or settings. Office politics, I guess.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/tarzan-1999.html",Tarzan
98,GuyCC,"Tarzan returns to the ""classic"" Disney feel.",9,7 August 1999,"Everyone has their favorite Disney film(s).  From more of the classic movies (Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty) to the newer films (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King), I've had more of my share.  I had better find a space in there for Tarzan.Tarzan, simply put, was amazing.  The animation was the usual Disney quality (top-notch), the story didn't wander as far off track as some of the other films, and Tarzan and Jane were great characters.  Minnie Driver's slightly scatterbrained twist on Jane made for a very enjoyable character, and Tarzan ""surfing"" through the trees and his fascination with the human world made for one of the best depictions of the character I've seen (I'm so glad they didn't use the ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" cliche).  I was also impressed on how well they handled the death issues in the movie.  The subject wasn't dropped halfway through the film, but it wasn't constantly focused on, and what little was seen was brief. Tarzan was a beautiful film to watch, and though many seem to criticize Phil Collins' singing, I didn't have a problem with it.  I found myself wishing that the film would have gone on longer than it had.My only complaint?  I found Clayton to be too much of the stereotypical ""bad guy"".  Sure, he was the kind of character that you could ""boo"" at through the film, but I would have liked to have seen more depth to him.  I don't see him joining the ""Great Disney Villain"" pantheon anytime soon.Even if you've been ""burned"" by past Disney films, this is one to see, and will easily find its place in my movie collection.  Highly recommended.",Tarzan
99,matlefebvre20,"The king of the jungle, indeed!",8,8 May 2009,"Edgar Rice Burroughs would have once suggested that his Tarzan character would fit perfectly with animation. If that anecdote is true, then we could say that Burroughs was a visionary man. But I don't know at which point his vision would have met the one that Disney Studios used to realize their own version of the man raised by the gorillas.""Tarzan"" is among the most spectacular adventures ever made by Disney. Not only the animation is astonishingly innovative and breathtaking, but the story, the characters and the wonderful songs from pop superstar Phil Collins will undoubtedly satisfy the youngsters and the grown-ups.Tarzan's story has been adapted to screen a rather incalculable amount of times in the history of cinema, most notably in the middle of the 20th century with Olympic athlete Johnny Weissmuller in the title role, but this ""Tarzan"" is the very first feature-length animated movie about the man-ape, and it takes advantage from every benefit that animation could bring in its presentation, but especially into the characters' development.The relationship which Tarzan keeps up with the gorillas, which he considers his family, are never really convincing in live action. And the attempts made to give some personality to the jungle creatures had never really allowed the viewers to express any sympathy towards them. We just have to look at the movie adaptation of ""George of the Jungle"" to be convinced.But here, the jungle animals are really likable and their depth allows to give to the story a much stronger foundation than everything that was done before. The relationship between Tarzan and his gorilla ""mother"" Kala (voiced by Glenn Close) is incredibly touching. Tarzan is also surrounded by funny and entertaining sidekicks, such as tomboyish gorilla Terk (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) and coward elephant Tantor (voiced by Wayne Knight). Even Kong-like Kerchak (voiced by Lance Henriksen) is rather well developed beyond his monstrous stature, and his attitude towards ""strangers"" kinda recalls Shere Khan in ""The Jungle Book"".And talking about ""The Jungle Book"", ""Tarzan"" inevitably sparks comparisons with the 1967 Disney classic, since both movies own many resemblances. Both of them talk about a human kid whose parents have died and who is raised by the jungle beasts. And when comes the moment of choosing their true place, between the animals and the humans, both Mowgli and Tarzan are confronted with heartbreaking dilemmas. So which one of the two movies is the best? Well, there again, it depends of your preferences. ""The Jungle Book"" benefits from a gallery of characters that is larger, more diversified and more elaborate than in ""Tarzan"". And that's probably on the weaknesses of the latter movie. Besides the gorillas, the elephants, a few baboons and one leopard, Tarzan's jungle seems to be rather huge, but also rather empty. And the musical numbers are way livelier in ""The Jungle Book"", and they are incorporated better into the story. The Phil Collins songs in ""Tarzan"", as good as they might be, sometimes give the impression that the images we see are merely a pretext for music videos which we could find on the MTV channel.The greatest advantage of ""Tarzan"" on ""The Jungle Book"" is the quality of its animation. Beside Tarzan's jungle, Mowgli's habitat looks like a botanical garden. In order to give more dimension to the African wild environment in which the characters live, the animators at Disney have created a new animation process called ""deep canvas"". This process gives more dimension to the jungle, giving the realist impression that the characters are moving themselves into a three-dimensional universe. The results are astounding. The illusion is pitch perfect. Thus we could bill ""Tarzan"" as a 2.5D animated movie.This process allows animators to conceive astonishing sequences where Tarzan moves from one vine to the other with the movements and the style of a skateboarder and also to create action and chase scenes which turn a trek among the branches and the vines into an authentic roller coaster ride. The images are often dizzying. Some of them might even be too much dizzying to my taste and I would have had no objection to slowing some scenes so I could appreciate them better.That kind of new technological development clearly shows that Disney is still the number 1 animated house in the world. It also demonstrates that, in spite of the constant rise of computer-animated features, movies made in traditional animation still own their place inside our film universe. I don't want to take off anything from computer-animated movies, but I have always preferred movies made in traditional animation. I have always felt that emotions and feelings were stronger and more authentic in that format instead of in 3D animation. There are some truly touching moments in ""Tarzan"" and I don't have the impression that those scenes would have had the same impact had this movie been realized in 3D animation.With the exception of Tarzan himself, there are only a few human characters in the movie and they are not among the most memorable ones. Jane maintains an interesting, but rather ambiguous relationship with Tarzan. Her father is your typical British scientist, while Clayton the hunter is not one of the most threatening nor interesting villains we have in the Disney filmography.Beside a few glitches, ""Tarzan"" still is an exceptional animated movie and a must-see for Disney fans. There is no better introduction to the world of Tarzan than this movie. Of course, beyond it, there are the Weissmuller movies, but if you consider their relative absence in today's shop shelves, Disney's movies is a more-than-perfect alternative. There is no doubt that it belongs among Disney classics, along with ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"".",Tarzan
100,Peter T. Movie,An A class movie,10,21 August 1999,"This movie is SO good, I can't believe it. ""TARZAN"" is truly a brilliant movie. Even as a teenager I was amazed by the quality of this movie. This film doesn't have the childish properties that a lot of the past Disney movies had. Its very easy to get caught up in this movie while you watch it. It is more realistic than I ever expected it to be. Also, it has amazing art quality, great music, a terrific story, and well developed characters.Some things that surprised me about this movie is that blood was shown several times. Also, there was more violence in this movie than in any other disney movie I've seen. I went through several emotions while watching this film and that was surprising (I didn't cry), because even ""TITANIC"" didn't have that type of effect on me. Thats why I discribe this movie as ""brilliant"". I don't think I can find any flaws in this film. Disney did such an exellent job with this movie that I now have a new respect for them. When I went to the theatre, I was expecting something like ""JUNGLE BOOK"". So, as you can see, this movie went way above my expectations. When ""TARZAN"" comes out on video, I will not hesitate to buy it. I want to own this masterpiece. Now that Disney has made the best movie ever, I will have higher expectation for them in the future. I give this movie an 11 out of 10. Or an A+. Good work.",Tarzan

102,Jeremy Bristol,"Should've been a Perfect 10, but instead a 7",7,14 June 2001,"I take away the first point partly for killing off the villain (yet again) and partly because the villain was ridiculous in the first place, taking up time that could have been used to expand the usual quick-cut musical montage.Hence the reason for the removal of the second point: having a musical montage take the place of an emotional or important event (two actually: tarzan growing up and Tarzan learning about civilization).  Is it really so much to ask for them to be expanded?  Despite what people think about the attention span of children, they are often enthralled when things they know are turned on their heads (when I was a kid, I loved that bird in the Little Mermaid whose explanations of forks and pipes were so far off base).The final point I remove is for the allegedly hip side characters, who speak like kids from the 1990's instead of the 1890's.  It really bugs me, but I'm not sure why.  I guess it's partly because ten years from now, kids will be laughing ""at"" lines like ""That one hurt 'em,"" just like people today laugh at Jimminy Cricket's antiquated idioms.

103,Rainfox,Welcome to the jungle,10,19 November 1999,"* * * * ½  (4½ stars of 5)Thoroughly warm, dynamic and rewarding Disney movie destined to be remembered among the best.Fast paced and constantly entertaining (not a dull moment), the legend of Tarzan swings again by way of a great screenplay (Burroughs is intelligently yet honorably cooked down) and some amazing and funny vocal work (Rosie McDonnell is hilarious as teenage friend Terk, Lance Henriksen is terrifying as silverback Kerchak, and Glenn Close is nothing short of magical as mother Kala.)Visually awe inspiring, Tarzan is like nothing you have ever seen before. I was told of this in advance, but little did I expect this much of a quantum leap; it can not be grasped untill witnessed. And this, in a cinema. Pleeeeze.The Disney studios introduce a new technique called `deep canvas´ - a form of greater scope, depth and texture by way of incorporating 2D characters in a 3D (CGI) enviroment - that truly make the jungle and it`s creatures come alive. Some downright spectacular action sequences (Indiana Jones worthy) - staged in this beautiful and lavish world of worlds - leave young as well as old gasping in their seats.Also watch for :* The distinct lack of characters crooning (singing), as the songs (Phil Collins) are used as a backdrop or for story compressional purposes only.* The intelligent twists on the incarnation of the figure of Tarzan. Mainly; here he walks on all fours like a gorilla. What a great touch.* The character of Jane; always a sore spot in other renditions (from the `Me Tarzan, you-scream-and-schmooze-only-Jane´ theory), is completely wonderful here. Minnie Driver`s ""performance"" is Academy Award worthy; fiesty, cheery, heartfelt and the best female lead since Lady (Lady and the Tramp).Ultimately fun for all ages, Tarzan only has one minor setback. The inclusion of a villain will - to the nitty-gritty - seem somewhat superflous as we are busy being enchanted by the wonderful scenery and characters and really have no wish to be disturbed.Go now.

104,marcotiero,Sub par Disney,4,4 July 2020,"This is pretty poor by Disney standards.I know this is supposed to be an animated feature film, yet the art work looks too ""cartoon"" like it was made for Disney Jr or something.I like Phil Collins but his songs in this are so cheesy and pretty terrible.Disney animated movies are always enjoyed by all, but this is so watered down that it feels like the target audience are pre-schoolers and movies like Aladdin feel serious in comparison.The apes stumbling into the camp and suddenly start making music is just so cringey. A 3 year old might find this amusing, but anyone over the age of 9 will probably find it awkward.A poor cash in of the fantastic Tarzan character",Tarzan
105,xsophietaylorx,Beautiful,8,24 September 2014,"Tarzan is beautiful. Everyone of Tarzan's characters Is likable. My personal favourite is definitely Tantor the little one liners that elephant comes out with are actually laugh out loud funny really are hysterical. Kala Tarzan's adoptive mother is just such a sweet gorilla she instantly takes Tarzan under her care and protects him even when others look down on him. At first Kerchak was the only character I didn't like as much as the others but at the end my heart completely warmed to him (be warned the end is a tear starter) Phill Collins is a music God and all his songs in this film are absolutely brilliant and add that extra spice to the movie. In the film we see Tarzan as a infant, young teen & adult we see him grow more and more into a Gorilla like state until Jane in which he starts picking up his natural human traits.

106,Rhino Rover,beautiful story,9,19 June 1999,"The first thing that hit me as the movie started was the feeling of something grand and different. I felt this when I saw The Lion King and I liked that movie so this was a good sign.Disney stepped out on the edge here with the depiction of Tarzan and what has resulted is a fabulous movie. Unlike Disney's last Tarzan movie (The Jungle Book), this one had a more adult theme and feel to it. The story allows the audience to gain some insight and feeling into Tarzan's character and personal conflicts. It does an admirable job on some of the peripheral characters too, like Tarzan's mother and father (the gorilla parents).Most of the humor was very well done and definitely generated a laugh (the loudest laughs came from adults!). The one character that got out of hand and became annoying at points was the character that Rosie O'donnell plays (Tarzan's best friend).The animation was fabulous and it becomes doubly amazing when you realize that this was not done strictly with computers. The scenery was stunning and the audience is treated to innovative camera angles that quite literally created a thrilling ride. It wouldn't surprise me to see Disney create a ride for this at their parks.The biggest thing that I noticed was that this was the first Disney movie that did not have the characters launch into song at various points. Phil Collins does an amazing job with the music and it was incorporated into the movie at different parts to substitute for the character songs. This definately added to movie and created a more smooth flowing story.Overall, this would be a movie that I would recommend any adult to go see. Guys, this is a great date movie. For children this is a must see. 9/10.",Tarzan
107,xyzkozak,"Two Worlds, One Family",7,11 January 2015,"From its dramatic opening sequence, to its jubilant, high-five finale, Disney's ""Tarzan"" is, without question, a very entertaining re-telling of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tale of a helpless, human baby reared to adulthood, in the jungle, by a band of gorillas.Featuring some excellent action sequences (mixed generously with moments of slapstick comedy and the excitement of adventure), 1999's ""Tarzan"" certainly turned out to be a mighty fine example of first-rate story-telling that actually tugged on this viewer's heartstrings, occasionally.In this animated feature film, the lean and athletic Tarzan (as the story's hero) comes across as being a truly likable and endearing character.Punctuated by songs (which seemed a bit out of place) from pop star, Phil Collins, ""Tarzan"" is still a delightful movie-experience that can definitely be enjoyed by all ages, young and old.",Tarzan

Disney's new animation technology, Deep Canvass, shows that there's still plenty of technology to explore in this kind of animation. The story is entertaining and moving.  Although predictable and simple, we are drawn to the story.  It seems like Disney pulled some punches to the story though, as if held back for the convenience of moving the plot.  One critic in my country pointed the ease with which Tarzan's origin was told. Nevertheless, this ""holding back"" doesn't stop me from describing this movie as excellent. The only element that I really didn't like was Jane's father who's somehow for convenience sake is made like a buffoon.  Rosie O' Donnel's performance as Terk was natural but Mr. Porter was simply unlikely for a researcher. The verdict: 4.5 of 5 stars.",Tarzan
109,bblack1-699-968577,"But That Death Though!! (IMDb won't let me ""shout"" in my Summary)",7,18 June 2014,"Tarzan is kind of like ""Mulan;"" it gained positive reviews from credits, it was a hit at the box office, and people still seem to like it today. Even though this movie grossed more money, I don't know if people like it more than Mulan now...Maybe that's just me. While I do like this movie, it just doesn't grab me as much as other Disney films. But there are still some good things about the film that I really enjoy.ANIMATION: This animation is amazing! You really feel like you're in the jungle. Look at the trees, the waterfall, the sky, the contrast between the darkness and brightness - you can't help but be sucked in the atmosphere! I like the animation of the characters, too. The leopard moves so wildly and quick, but that's how they move AND it adds to the threat he brings! Tarzan looks like a strong, bold hero. I love his intense moments because he really looks into it. Whether he's angry, scared, remorseful, or whatever, you get sucked into the emotion he feels.SONGS/MUSIC: I'll be honest, I can't get into these Phil Collins songs. I'm not saying they're bad, but I myself can't get invested into these music numbers. The last time my brother and I watched this film together, we made fun of the way these songs basically narrate the movie for us. ""Two worlds, one family..."" Get it? Tarzan is apart of these two worlds because of his upbringing, but he bridges them together, thus they're one. ""...Take my hand..."" When we heard him say that, Tarzan and Jane literally took hands! Yeah, I just can't get into them. The only song I really love is ""Trashin' in the Camp."" Though it has nothing to do with anything, it is a lot of fun!ROMANCE: This is another interesting romance. It's a great set up for a romance, given Tarzan's past and family. I like watching him with Jane, and I love how they both help each other. I have to admit, though, I wanted more. I feel the movie could have given us more insight into their relationship. Don't get me wrong, I believe they're in love, but I think the movie is trying to fight for room for the villain's plan. The romance is good, but I could have taken more of it.CHARACTERS: Tarzan is...OK. I don't know if it's the acting or the writing, but I don't find him that interesting. I actually invest more concern for Young Tarzan than adult Tarzan; I just thought he was more interesting. He had more to fight for, he had more to prove, and he was not bland. Adult Tarzan...is. He's not totally boring, as he is active, but his character as a whole is just kind of bland. Fortunately, Jane is not that at all! She's funny, eccentric, smart, and active. She's a lot of fun! Her father is the same, I love watching him! I guess some people find Terk annoying - by the way, is Terk male or female; I promise I hear something different every time I watch this movie - but Terk is fine to me. Honestly, Tantor is the annoying character to me. His character gets in the way, his dialogue is stupid, and he's just too much of a worry wart to me. I like him during the climax of the film, but he doesn't do anything for me. Likewise, Clayton doesn't phase me that much. He's not annoying, but he is kind of boring. I just don't remember that much from him. When I think about villains and threats in this movie, I think of the leopard. I don't know if it's his motivation or his character itself, but he just didn't affect me...Though, his death is one of the most darkest and possibly coolest deaths ever put in a Disney movie! Did you see his body swinging in the shadows?!! Good grief, said Charlie Brown!STORY: The story is good. It's nothing too special, but it does cause a great set up. We've all heard of Tarzan before, but I like that this one delves a bit in the dramatic conflict of what it means for a little boy to be raised by gorillas, and how he reacts when he sees humans for the first time. Honestly, I think this was enough to make a movie. If they had expanded these elements more and removed the plot about selling the gorillas, I think the story would have been better. That part isn't bad, necessarily; it's just that (1) it's been done, and (2) this movie doesn't do anything different or new with it...with the exception of leading to that great death scene! But maybe that's why I like the younger Tarzan more: with him, we actually do focus on him trying to fit in with the animals around him. It's not fighting for a cliché plot. Again, the story is good, but it could have been better if it weren't for Clayton's evil deeds...BUT THAT DEATH THOUGH!! OK, I'm done.CONCLUSION: I do like this movie. There are some things that could have been done to make the film better, but the final product is still enjoyable. I love the animation, I can't get enough of ""Trashin' in the Camp,"" I like the romance, I like the characters, and the story is good. This film may be a bit underrated, but it's still enjoyed by many. Take a look for yourself and see what you think. God bless you. BOOYIKA!",Tarzan

112,joshfedderson,A Film About Personal Discovery,10,12 August 2018,"Tarzan is a Disney classic, it will always be one of my favorite movies. Tarzan is just not a film about a man growing up in the jungle, it is a film about self discovery. In the film Tarzan discovers who he really is, and his story is kind of a sad one. His parents and him are marooned, they try to survive but are killed by a Leopard. Tarzan is raised by wild apes and basically that is his whole environment. But I believe Tarzan is a story about self discovery, it is about a human being discovering who he is a how special he is. A lot of Disney movies aim toward good messages, and Tarzan aims towards excepting who you are no matter your differences. The story is great and the characters make it even more great. For it's time the animation is fabulous. Some of my favorite Characters are Tantor, Terk, and of course Tarzan. Jane is pretty funny too, and I find her attractive for a cartoon character when I was a kid I thought she was pretty, still think so. The film also brings in great music with Phil Collins singing every song, and doing a great job. Tarzan is a story about self discovery and about excepting who you are. A great message to kids and adults.10/10 for Tarzan",Tarzan

114,StartingAllOver14,Disney's Tarzan - at last!,8,11 August 2007,"I wasn't so very surprised that Disney were putting their hands on Tarzan when I first heard about this project. It's a enjoyable movie, not absolutely perfect, but it's one of Disney's most stable films.The songs of Phil Collins are great (I know many don't like the songs in the film, but I personally love them) and the case that he sings the songs himself were a good choice. The score of Mark Mancina is also good. The films is very dynamic, have a lot of elements of action, romance and comedy in the same way that Disney did in the early 90's and comparing to the films after The Lion King, (even I liked those films) ""Tarzan"" is the feature who has the magic, family-friendly Disney-feeling too it. The animation is gorgeous (SPOILER: even Kerchak is the only gorilla in the film who certainly looks like a real gorilla, the same color and etc. SPOILERS OVER). The deep canvas scenes are very impressive.The story and the script works well, even the script is a little thin and it's suffers the same way like ""Hercules"" script did - too much information to tell in a short time. So some stuff are getting left behind for further development. The story is of course changed to fit a Disney movie, but still it remains true to the essence of the character of Tarzan.HERE COMES AGAIN A SPOILER I don't quite sympathize with Kerchak (even I feel sorry for him for his lost of his child) cause he's so stubborn. Kala is a great mother character, even she seems a little oversensitive (for the same reason as Kerchak and it's sorry for her too) and I think the film should be more focused about Tarzan's feelings for Kala, instead than her feelings for him. But that's my opinion. To see a parent loose it's child in a Disney feature is quite heartbreaking, even it's just for a little second, but the film doesn't really focus about that.SPOILERS OVER.The humor in this film is sometimes funny, but also sometimes. Terk is a cool character, but Tantor (as a grown up) is pretty annoying. So is Professor Porter and the baboons. I found Jane pretty quirky at first, but watching the movie several times again, I must admit that she's a great and warm character. SPOILER AGAIN: Tarzan himself is almost in every scene, who is an exception in a Disney-film. SPOILERS OVERThe film have some wonderful, emotional moments without dialog, but in the third act the emotional scenes are getting too sentimental, which I didn't like.The films action scenes works also well, the highlights in the movies are when the leopard Sabor is in the scenes. And he is a greater ""villain"" than Clayton. ANOTHER SPOILER: Don't get me wrong, Clayton is a good and enjoyable character, but in the story in a unit, he's doesn't quite fit in.A LITTLE MORE SPOILER: Besides that, Tarzan it's a great movie. It's a kinda mixture of ""Lion King"" and ""Pocahontas"". ""Lion King"" because of the African setting, the animal rules etc and ""Pocahontas"" because of the clashes of two worlds (civilization vs nature).",Tarzan
115,T-10,Great entertainment for everyone,10,23 June 1999,"Tarzan is a near perfect film for the entire family.  It has comedy, drama, a soundtrack that fits well with what happening on the screen, feelings and emotions, and it's fun.  The animators outdid themselves.  The background scenery was stunning and lifelike.  The opening scenes were well written and emotionally satisfying (I think it unfair to be specific). The scene in which Tarzan morphs from a child to an adult was visually brilliant.  The choice of Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan's voice was excellent.  It had a warmth and vulnerability that brought a new dimension to the obvious physicality of the apeman.  The other outstanding voice selection was Glenn Close who voiced Kala, Tarzan's ape mother.  She brought real feelings of sensitivity and nurturing.  There were times when my eyes got moist (yes I'm an old softy). At other times the action sequences had you feeling as if riding a roller coaster.  Great!  Probably the only weakness in the film was the obligatory villain and that subplot which neither added or took away from the film but just seemed tacked on.  All in all, Tarzan is a great movie and should be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated.  Three and half stars!!!",Tarzan
116,zack2085,A good movie anyone can enjoy,7,16 August 1999,"""Tarzan"" was a really fun movie, for adults, teens or kids. Being a teen myself, I would usually go for the ""She's All That"", ""Cruel Intentions"" or ""Scream"" kinda movies, but the previews for ""Tarzan"" didn't look THAT bad. In comparison to the horror of ""Pochahontes"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (which were both equally dreadful!) this one looked great. And I was right.The plot is really good; action, romance, comedy, adventure, tenderness, it has it all. And the characters are all funny and creative- especially Tarzan, Jane and Tarzan's funny friend elephant (I forgot his name at the moment). Minnie Driver, Rosie 'O Donnel  and Wayne Night (NEWMAN of Seinfeld!) did a great job with their voices.The animation is truly amazing too. The 3D effects and computer generized stuff makes you  say ""wow"" and there is such detail in the forest.
This movie is tons of fun.. one of Disney's best. My rating: 8.5 out of 10",Tarzan
117,pmcollectorboy,Disney's worst,3,14 September 2000,"I don't get the love surrounding this pathetic, cookie cutter, lame excuse for a Disney movie. This is easily Disney's worst movie ever created, surpassing even Dinosaur in lameness, and that's no small feat. This is the most formulaic Disney movie yet. Nothing new is attempted, and it even goes the opposite way, pulling out all the stops to throw in as many stereotypes and cliches as possible. What we get is a mixture of violence too scary for kids and humor too awful for adults. Everybody tries to make the movie seem funny, but the result seems forced and even out of place. Clayton is the typical maniacal villain that just shoots at everything for no apparent reason. His motives are unclear, and he often comes off as being silly. The professor is just another wimpy goofball, and Jane is obnoxiously silly, weak and very stereotypical. Since when was it okay to show a female lead character as a source of humor? Jeez. Kids might get the wrong ideas. Jane should go down in history as the worst designed female character ever created by Disney. Everytime I see her face, I'm not sure whether to cringe or laugh my head off. Tantor and Terk are not funny, and Tarzan is not an admirable hero. But hey. Don't take my word for it. Everybody else loves it. I'm just not one of them.",Tarzan
118,matthewnoorman,Just okay,6,23 June 2021,"Most people will disagree with me which is fine, its a decent film but for Disney or Pixar just okay is not good enough. Outside of Phil Collins tremendous score this film is just an average Disney film. The humor falls flat for me, the story moves like a Disney film but it just feels like a recycled story. Theres some major plot holes that make this harder to watch as an adult, I liked it as a kid. But some of the action sequences are just a little sloppy. Kerchak a Giants Gorilla could kill a Tiger without breaking a sweat but somehow losses the fight and a human somehow manages to kill it and pick it up, a 300-600 pound male tiger over his head. Things like that as an adult just make this movie harder for me to watch. I guess if you over look those things i can see someone enjoying it. I might have just outgrown some of Disneys work but in comparison to The Lion King and Aladdin and the other movies Pixar and Disney was coming out at this time Tarzan just feels so average.",Tarzan
119,minerwolfminer,A 1999 MOVIE!,10,27 June 2021,"I rewatched this with my cousins, siblings, uncle, auntie, grandpa, grandma and my mom; a lot of us watched it and we ALL
ENJOYED IT. I can't believe this was on 1999 😱 That is truly fascinating! We all loved this movie. The animation, their voices, the characters, and of course, Phil Collins' touching songs. "" You'll be in my heart "" has been my favorite ever since I was 10 yrs. Old and so will this amazing and fun movie. I love Tarzan and the rest of the characters....",Tarzan
120,LDB_Movies,Disappointed...,6,28 June 1999,"Despite the rave reviews of ""Tarzan"", I must say I was disappointed by it. It pales in comparison to most of the recent Disney cartoons including the underrated ""Hunchback of Notre Dame""-- it's not quite in the same league as ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Lion King"".First, to make it clear to prospective viewers, this movie IS NOT A MUSICAL! I was very surprised by that.  Phil Collins' songs are sparsely featured throughout the film, but he sings them all.  I found that a bit jarring and it ""threw me off"" for nearly the first 30 minutes of the film.The plot is thin at the start, but picks up when Jane arrives.  Minnie Driver's vocalization of Jane is definitely the highlight of the entire film.  She is perfect.The ending of the film I found a bit contrived.  Without trying to spoil the plot, let's just say I had trouble with the ""being in love"" part-- I think a more likely reason for certain people to stay with Tarzan is that their life's work involving gorillas could be fulfilled.  There was no evidence of anyone being ""in love"" throughout the movie.",Tarzan
121,phantopp,A pretty fun movie,7,4 September 2009,"Based on the famous series of novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950), Disney has come up with a pretty entertaining adaptation of the beloved literary character.The first thing I must talk about is the animation. Disney has perfectly blended classic animation with computer animation. The computer animation enhances the classic animation with movement drawings couldn't do. In many scenes, ""Tarzan"" (child voiced by Alex D. Lintz; adult voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is sliding on large tree branches rapidly. In the classic animation style, they would not have been successful in ""following"" ""Tarzan"" through the trees as well as they could with computer animation due to the rapid movement.There are very few dark colors in the scenery. In fact, the only dark colors were used for the gorillas, shadowing and human hair. Most of the colors are light gray, lots of green (it is in a jungle) and other brighter colors.There are some pretty good performances in this film. However, none really stood out in my opinion. I was not that impressed with some supporting characters, as they had little screen time and thus had no time to develop. Rosie O'Donnell was a delight as ""Terk,"" who was ""Tarzan's"" best gorilla friend.If you ask me, they really missed the mark to make a memorable villain in this film. They had two chances, but killed one, and just did a horrible job making a human villain.As for music, which Disney is known for, there isn't a lot performed on screen by characters like in previous movies. In fact, characters burst into two songs. The rest of the soundtrack is done mainly by Grammy and Academy Award-winning Phil Collins. The songs by Collins is easily a lot more memorable than the rest of the musical score. In fact, all I really can remember is Collins songs. However, the Collins songs, which he wrote and performed, is not as memorable as some of the classic songs Disney is known for. Therefore, if you hear the songs by Collins, you won't be catching yourself singing these tunes, nor will you think of the movie when you hear the songs. The songs did fit well into scenes though.The movie is well paced, however I did think the story was really rushed due to the 89 minute length of the film. They really rushed the part where ""Jane"" (voiced by Minnie Driver) and the team she was with tried to bring ""Tarzan"" back to civilization with some of the animal characters as prizes. They also did a pretty good job with the famed relationship between ""Jane"" and Tarzan. If this movie was a little longer, they really could have worked on many scenes, character development and the relationships between the characters. After seeing this movie, I am almost certain they made the animated television series based on this movie to better explore the relationships in the movie.If you ask me, this is almost a Disney classic. But, in my opinion, it barely misses the mark to be up there with ""Snow White"" and others touched by Disney's magic.",Tarzan
122,bek-12,"""Animal Man packs a Wallop""... Tarzan ROCKS.",8,8 February 2000,"You know, I'm 30 years old and have been a movie fan since I was about 22 or 23.  I've watched so many movies almost every one is predictable and, most of the time, boring.  Watching the beautiful animation in this latest incarnation of Tarzan was just stunning--no joke.  The story was reminescent of The Lion King, and my favorite scene (many animation fans will know which scene I'm talking about) looks a lot like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, but similarities aside, Disney has made another timeless masterpiece.  Who needs Anime?  I watch that stuff that so many people like, and I can't understand the stories, the motivations, or feel sympathy for the characters.  Anime.  Who needs it when we've got Disney.I could only be happier if they finally made a serious animated movie.  Take out all the singing and dancing, and put in a tough, realistic story. Otherwise, it's still easily an 8 out of 10 or better.Congratulations, Disney.  Best one since The Lion King.",Tarzan
123,spoken,Surfing the Emotions,9,6 May 2004,"This movie is nothing if not about relationships, and with them come the emotions.  All of them in plenty quantity.  I felt drawn into every facet of Tarzan's life through story, music and excellent animation.  Other users' comments go into good detail, so I won't do a repeat.  But I will add that Disney's relatively new *kind* of attention to facial detail makes certain scenes truly heart-grabbing.I also wish to point out to any concerned that I thought the death scenes were done with appropriate sensitivity, and the bad guy's demise was actually a self-inflicted accident which comes into play in one of the daily cartoons.I recommend viewers remember this is fictional, an extended cartoon, and ""just a movie"" to sit back and enjoy.",Tarzan
124,patboldt,The Best Adaptation of the Jungle Swinger,8,25 February 2018,"Tarzan is an underrated masterpiece made by Disney before the 3D age. I found this to be very engaging and very entertaining. Mostly because this movie is beautiful to look at and has truly great animation. The color scheme feels lively and active, one can really appreciate the beauty and wonder of the jungle and the animals that inhabit it.Furthermore ths story is also amazing and very entertaining. While it's not a perfect retelling of Tarzan nor is it an accurate one, it works and feels like an original retelling of this epic. My favorite character is Kerchek who is a really cool character and one who really adds life to the narrative. Tarzan is also a welcome character who really is fun and exciting. He starts off decent but ends up becoming awesome. This movie feels like a great adaptation of Tarzan which feels alive and refreshing unlike the live action reboot. The soundtrack in this movie is also amazing and Phil Collins really shines. The music is amazing and adds the Disney magic to this movie and it works so well because the music can be enjoyed outside of the movie. Overall I give it an 8/10 and think it's a pretty great Disney movie. Give it a watch.",Tarzan
125,Spencer-Staggs,A Great Disney Film For Everyone To Enjoy,7,2 March 2021,"1999's ""Tarzan"" is an absolutely wonderful Disney film from the Disney Renaissance. Tarzan was raised by gorillas after his parents were killed by a leopard. After being found by a gorilla named Kala who is mated to the leader of the gorillas (the small group Tarzan is in), Kerchak. After seeing Tarzan through the years we get to see Tarzan with his pals (Tantor the elephant and Terk the gorilla) all grown up. Tarzan hears a blast from somewhere and Kerchak decides to move the gorilla group, and Tarzan decides to go find where the sound comes from. There, Tarzan meets Jane who needs some help... I really don't want to write the whole film out, but Clayton's death is one of the more horrific Disney deaths out there. :)",Tarzan
126,Dr.Mike,Above Average Disney Fare,7,6 August 1999,"Tarzan is Disney's latest attempt at redoing a classic story.  In general, they succeed.  The film is fast paced and exciting.  The messages in the film are not as overdone as they sometimes are in Disney films.  Lessons about adoption, tolerance, and the meaning of family are all welcome from Disney.  After all, as one of our children's leading entertainment producers it is important for them to include positive messages and role models in their films.As for the negative parts of the film, one has to start with the music. Imagine how exciting some risk-taking music would be in a Disney film.  Some real jazz musicians working on some jungle music, or maybe a little acid jazz. Instead, we get the whitest man on earth, Phil Collins, singing utterly forgettable tunes about topics he knows nothing about.  Another bad point was, strangely, the animation, which seemed uninspired.  Sure, some of the sequences had an undeniable flow to them, but in general the film felt like it had been ground out in a hurry.  As Pixar continues to improve their methods, it will be interesting to see if Disney keeps up.  In spite of these problems and the participation of the worst actress in Hollywood (O'Donnell) and the most overrated (Driver), the film is recommended to all who enjoy Disney films and those who believe that film can teach our children well.",Tarzan
127,Soujiro,The Best Disney Movie Since Beauty and The Beast,9,2 July 1999,"First of all, I have not been favorably impressed with a Disney Movie since Aladdin.  The primary reason is simple, I dislike childish smart-allecky Tom and Jerry gags.  I don't mind joking as long as it's reasonably intelligent, above say the three year old level.  But I'm not going to go into all of that.However, Tarzan marks a potential major turning point for Disney and I absolutely love it.  First of all, the movie maintains a relatively serious mood throughout its length aside from the gorilla scatting which I feel is the low point.  The voice acting is wonderful, and Minnie Driver's awkward quirky Jane is the most appealing female Disney character ever.  Glenn Close is perfect as Tarzan's mother as is Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan.  Baby Tantor has that familiar adorable childish whine.The voice acting would be nothing without the support of believable, straight forward, emotional, intelligent writing.  This is what I am most impressed with in Tarzan.  There are very few cheap laughs and one-liners which force many of their other recent movies into a ""sitcom for 3 year olds"" feel.  The character of Clayton seems a bit tacked on but I suppose a Disney movie without a traditional villain is too much to ask for.In another major turning point, with one minor (appropriate) exception the characters DON'T sing! Instead the music accompanies the animation allowing the characters to act more naturally and believably.  All of the music fits the animation perfectly and it's clear that the animators worked hard to fit each scene to the songs' lyrics.Finally, the most obvious advance is in the animation.  The character design of Tarzan is brilliantly executed, and all of the apes are wonderfully like-like in their movements.  I was a bit disappointed to see the same old Jungle Book elephant designs, but it was a minor distraction.  The most impressive effect is the ""deep"" matte painting backgrounds composed of paintings wrapped around three dimensional surfaces allowing for very dynamic camera movements.One thing I would like to mention offhand.  This movie is NOT for babies or very small children.  This is a good thing, but it does mean that children three and below will probably be somewhat frightened.  Both of the times I have seen it the babies in the theater have cried.Disney fans will be quick to see similarities between Tarzan and The Jungle Book, and personally I like both of these movies about equally.  All in all, Tarzan is by far the best movie of the summer.",Tarzan
128,averjee,PC re-telling of Burroughs classic,7,6 July 1999,"There is no doubt that this is a very well-made, broad, sweeping epic - the kind of thing that Disney does very well. The animation is lush, utilizing a new technique called ""deep canvas"" that makes the background look more realistic and three-dimensional than any animated film that has gone before.Tarzan himself doesn't swing from vine t ovine so much as he surfs the jungle canopy; the visuals of the film are unquestionably first-rate. Energetic and quite violent for a kiddie flick, TARZAN doesn't have a lot of musical numbers for a Disney film.Yet, it is strangely unimaginative in the way it tells its story. The Burroughs tale had a racist element to it, which made it a fascinating study in multiculturalism. This version simply does away with the natives, to eliminate the thorny modern dilemma of racist subtext. Still, it's hard not to read the film in racial terms - it is ostensibly about figuring out where you belong, and about acceptance and tolerance, and the message is finally one about nurture defeating nurture.",Tarzan
129,Movieman-133,Entertaining throughout.,9,26 June 1999,"I thought the movie was good, and it was interesting and entertaining throughout. The voices are good,   the animation is marvelous(especially the action scenes),  and the characters of Anne,  Tarzan,   Kala were well developed.  The only failure in the movie was the music.  Phil Collins songs were upbeat and some were quite good, but Anne and Tarzan do not sing a single note in the entire film.   It was just Phil Collins as a narrative voice and I was a little repulsed at first.  The movie is not as sad as The Lion King's moments and probably would not make people cry,    but it does come in touch with children's themes and characters,  unlike the very adult themed Hunchback.  There was less side kicks in the film which was a plus, the villian was not as cartoon like as Jafar,  and he reminded of the greedy realistic villian of Pocahontas(not as appealing).  I was amused at a comment that usually all the villians die by falling and this movie adds a new twist to that aspect.   Overall entertaining film,   more appealing to children and much better than Mulan.   I'd recommend.",Tarzan
130,sebastianali123,The definition of great.,8,25 June 2021,"Tarzan is a great movie. Revolutionary animation, a very heartwarming story and it also has a very good soundtrack (and I didn't expect that). The only thing that if I was half annoyed was some silly jokes with Tarzan, he even becomes more dumb than when he was a child sometimes, which is surprising. But other than that, while it's not one of my favorite animated movies, I understand people who regard it as such, and it definitely stands out. Fully recommended.P. S: I don't know what people refer to ""Disney renaissance, but it probably was a very important movie, and I could rewatch it any time.",Tarzan
131,moviecritichank-7,Great way to end the Disney Renaissnance!,10,30 July 2009,"I first saw the theatrical trailer for ""Tarzan"" when I went to go see Disney's ""Mighty Joe Young"" and I knew it would be a great movie! I went to go see ""Tarzan"" in theaters a month after its June release and I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to see it again! And now, ten years later, I am finally writing a review for another one of my favorite Disney movies. Tarzan is a story (like most other Disney films sitting on your shelves and mine) about a man and a beautiful woman who meet and fall in love. But, Tarzan is a man who was found by an ape named Kala (Glenn Close) and raised by her after his birth parents are killed by a vicious leopard named Sabor. After she rescues him from Sabor, she takes him in and Kerchak, the silverback leader of the apes (Lance Henriksen), does not accept him as his son. Soon he finds friendship from the likes of a comic ape named Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) and a nutty elephant named Tantor (Wayne Knight) who help him become King of the Jungle. After he faces off with Sabor and kills him, saving Kerchak's life, Kerchak starts to respect him more. Then, he discovers man is in the jungle. But, he finds out they look and talk just like him! Now, he finds companionship with the beautiful Jane (Minnie Driver) who will teach him human ways. Like every story, there is a villain. The villain in this one is a greedy hunter named Clayton (Brian Blessed) who wants to hunt down and kill Tarzan's ape family. Tarzan has everything an animated movie should have: great story, great music score, great characters,an amazing climax, and a valuable lesson that can be learned and applied in everyday life. I have a lot of movies on my shelf, and this is one that I own. If you haven't seen this yet, I encourage you to do so. My rating for Tarzan: 10/10!",Tarzan
132,mallard-6,A new Disney classic! Among Disney's best!,9,7 September 1999,"This is a most enjoyable film. It is bright, coherent, funny, suspensful, colorful, and fulfilling. The characters are well conceived and brilliantly executed. This is a Disney film in the best traditions of the Disney studios--miles above Pochahantus, better far than Hercules or Hunchback, on a par with Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Dumbo, etc.",Tarzan
133,cbentrott,Classic Disney,8,13 November 2021,"Good music, classic storyline, and entertaining visuals. This movie is simple yet effective in its message that it's trying to deliver. Phil Collins makes some bangers for the soundtrack and O'Donnell shines as Turk.",Tarzan
134,WilliamOTyler,This Tarzan is as energetic and fluid as only animation can make him.,9,28 January 2016,"Disney's 1997 film Tarzan is often overlooked, partially because it's a stand alone film that hasn't been inducted into a franchise of princesses and also partially because the rights to the character of Tarzan are still tightly guarded by the estate of his creator, Edgar Rice Burroughs. Even still, it has proved itself to be a technological feat with a story, music and design worthy enough of being called a Disney classic.Coming at a time when Disney was struggling to recreate the success of The Lion King, it was probably a wise choice to do a story that most audiences would have already read or seen in some form. The general story is really already set, but Disney's presentation of the action swells while being comedic, romantic and even kinetic in a way that live-action filmmaking most likely could not pull off. Tarzan's movements swinging and sliding through the trees are inspired by modern skateboarders with lots of high energy. At the same time, the movie manages to balance its action with calm scenes focusing on character growth and romanticism. Tarzan learning a new culture and language is something mostly skipped over in Disney's earlier Pocahontas, so they get the chance to really explore through it here, and add in some laughs as well. Tarzan balances all of these aspects at once, creating a nice and natural flow.One thing that helps this natural movie flow is the music, presented not in crazy song and dance numbers, except one, but more so in several musical montages that not only cover a lot of time and growth, but does so in, again, a very organic way that doesn't feel too abrupt. Phil Collins' original songs are not only catchy and upbeat when they need to be, but also lullabying. They give us a sense of what the characters are thinking and feeling without them having to stop and sing it to us, adding to that flow.In fact, Tarzan is probably one of Disney's most fluidly animated films. Characters move smoothly and instinctively through the atmosphere so that it feels like they are gliding, yet they still are weighted and grounded. Long shots of Tarzan tree surfing or battling Sabor allow the camera to move with and around the characters seamlessly which, during the time that this film came out, was technically unheard of in animation. The production team created a new program called Deep Canvas just for this purpose, allowing them to take digitally painted backgrounds and animate them in 360 degrees. It's quite an achievement.Deep Canvas manages to pull the characters into the scenes even more than previous films, so that they become one. The bright colors of the characters are mimicked in the backgrounds, and even characters themselves hearken to other characters with their designs. Tarzan's lean but muscular design is exactly what it should be for someone who is constantly moving around on his knuckles the way his family of gorillas do. Along with his matted dreads, he is believably someone who has been stuck in a jungle for most of his life. While Disney has made a reputation out of giving animals human characteristics, perhaps only Mowgli in The Jungle Book has been an example of the opposite before Tarzan. These visual cues are memorable and strong.So Tarzan is not an animated movie to easily turn away from, despite it being often overlooked. The beautiful Deep Canvas technology aids a familiar story in being new, with perfectly balanced aspects of comedy, romance and action. Catchy music and stark designs also help to make Tarzan a Disney classic that should stand the test of time. It's a wonderful jungle to get completely lost in.",Tarzan
135,karagoraymond,"Yeah, this works !",7,26 March 2015,"A different but brilliantly adapted version of Borough's classic novel. From the get go Tarzan will have you wide eyed and waiting to see what will happen next. The opening sequence is one of the most impressive I have ever seen in film. The opening sequence is just so powerful as it shows the contrast of the human family (infant Tarzan with his parents) and the gorilla family living happily before tragedy strikes both families which leads Kala to finding the baby Tarzan. All done without dialog, all done with the great song ""Two Worlds"" in the background.Changing Tarzan's adoptive family to gorillas worked well because it showed a more gentle side to these great apes, which are often depicted as savage bruits in such films as King Kong and Planet of the apes. Tony Goldwyn did a great job as Tarzan; he hit the right balance of fun loving, relaxed and also emotional when it was required. However, Glen Close gave a soft, angelic voice to Kala that only a mother could have and her bond with both the child and adult Tarzan was at the emotional soul of the film. This was contradicted perfectly by Henriksen's performance as the un-accepting and judgmental ape leader Kurchack. Jane, Tantor, Turk were all great characters that all did well with adding humor at the appropriate times and what I liked about Driver's performance was that she was neither the defiant heroine nor the damsel in distress but rather she was simply a girl who had come to an untamed land and became enchanted with the world of a man she would later fall in love with. I would even go as far as to say that Jane is one of Disney's best female leads.I also give the movie points for the animations, most adaptations would have Tarzan swinging through the trees, but here he actually surfs through the trees.However, I do feel that the villain (voiced by Brian Blessed) was slightly weak in comparison to other characters, Clayton is not very interesting in terms of motivation but I do feel he could have been more unique if he had been made to look younger, I would have preferred to see him have the looks of say John Smith from Pocahontas, he just seemed quite forgettable but held up in the film's final third. I also feel the film would have been more effective if Sabor was given a speaking part. Simply having the leopard growl and roar seemed to make him a brainless carnivore as opposed to an enemy and in my humble opinion Sabor would have been more intimidating if the had a speaking role to match his ferocity.The film's strongest point was it's music and Phil Collins and Mark Mancina joined forces to create one of the greatest soundtracks I have heard in a very long time. With the exception of ""Trashing the camp"" which was sung by Turk, Collins used his actual voice for all of the songs and tunes such as ""Son of Man"" or ""Strangers like me"" or the Oscar winning ""You'll be in my heart"" will all go down as classics and give the film for being original and not sticking to the traditional musical tone.As one of the final traditionally animated films to be considered a hit, and is probably the greatest depiction of the story of Tarzan ever put on the big screen. An absolute must see.",Tarzan
136,djonin,Disney's flat animation falls flat again.,5,2 July 2000,"Disney's live action and animation in the past few years(with the exception of the Toy Story movies) just seams like they're not trying to come up with an engaging plot any more.  Instead they put some cool colors on the screen and think that's all you need to spend your money on. 
That's the problem with a lot of movies now days, but in Disney's case they don't think their Sh** stinks, and nether do the critics or movie going public.  They think as long as it has Disney on it, it can't be bad.  Unless it's a really good one like Pocahontas, that goes over their heads, then the movie going public hates it, just because the critics tell them to.The studios are not in the business to make good quality movies, but to make money, and as long as the public will buy the cool colors, big bangs, and one liners, the independent artist will get all the awards, and the studios will keep making dumb movies like this one.",Tarzan

It simply has it all - breathtaking animation, a rather faithful adaption of the story, a good share of humour, a good dose of action and excellent characterization, and, not to be forgotten, great songs by Phil Collins (although I'm not a fan of his usual solo works).
As I said in my comment to the new Star Wars movie, ""Tarzan"" succeeds in all points that ""The Phantom Menaces"" fails so bitterly - it's a movie perfect for kids but also highly entertaining for adults.Go and see it, you won't regret...",Tarzan
139,Ariel-28,This IS a real Tarzan!,10,18 December 1999,"I have read only the first of the Tarzan novels, and I must say that in fact I liked the Disney movie much more than it. Firstly, the filmmakers had changed the story so that Sabor (notice, the leopard, not the lioness) was the enemy of little Tarzan's family. I was really excited while she chased Kala and Tarzan. Kala is certainly the most tender and caring mother figure ever in the Disney films.It's a really excellent solution from Disney that Tarzan himself gets to know what it means to be different. It's also excellent that he moves like a gorilla and doesn't learn to speak human language perfectly. Finally the apes, even Kerchak, are ready to accept him as one of them, and it's good that he doesn't kill Kerchak like in the book.The meeting of Tarzan and Jane is one of the finest scenes in the movie. I was especially delighted when they both repeated each other's names - for I had been really amazed and disappointed that the famous words ""me Tarzan, you Jane"" failed from the novel. It's quite incredible to see the future lovers fly from tree to tree!Clayton is quite unbearable. I was really shocked when he had the gorillas imprisoned and yet tried to shoot Tarzan! His death was really the only good solution to the situation.The end is also the only to be possible. The film would not have been a real Tarzan story if Jane and Tarzan hadn't stayed together.",Tarzan
140,joebrian55,A childhood favourite and my first time in a movie theatre,10,16 June 2012,"Ever since my Mom took me along with my older brother, his friend and the friend's mom when he turned 6, I have held this movie very dear to me. I was 3 years old, about a few months before my 4th birthday, at the time and while I continue to wonder how I sat through the movie without having to be removed from the theatre, I have since managed to sit through outings at the movies.I admire the artwork, especially the blend of traditional animation and CGI, the music, the story and the voice acting. The decision to cast British actors to play Porter, Jane and Clayton is very well-suited, particularly Nigel Hawthorne who was also in The Black Cauldron, another childhood favourite.According to my mom, when we saw this in the theatre, I loved watching the end credits to the point where we had to wait until they were through so we could go home. Now I adore the songs performed by Phil Collins in this movie.Now we have the soundtrack CD, bought sometime after we saw it and when this movie came out on VHS in 2000, my mom and I went out and got it. Unfortunately, I stopped watching it after several viewings at home because it was too scary. When I was little, if a movie ever scared me, I decided the easiest thing to do was avoid it for as long as I possibly could. But when I was reaching adolescence, I went back and re-watched this movie and now it is once again one of my favourites.On the other hand, I would not recommend this for anyone under 5-7. There is some violence, a lot of fights, Kerchak tends to go into rages which may frighten kids, the opening scene and of course any scene with Sabor the leopard. Seriously. I urge you, if you're a parent, babysitter, grandparent or elder relative, to watch this movie before you let any children watch it and if so, watch it with them.All in all, this movie deserves 10 out of 10 for all the right reasons. ... If I could, though, I'd rate this 100/100.",Tarzan
141,mjuice,Disney misses the point - but delivers on everything but the story.,5,6 July 1999,"Normally, I don't go see animated films in the theater, because of the whiny-kid problem.  But Tarzan looked like it had such fun animation that I wanted to go see it.  But let's not worry too much about why I went to see it, let's instead worry about what it was like.I'll start with the good points:  First, the animation was fantastic.  Not a single moment in the movie fails to live up to the high standards the preview leads you to expect.  I would say the animation was not quite up to the level of The Lion King - mostly because the jungle canopy world of Tarzan is inherently confusing, so evoking it well gives a sense of magic, but not of realism.  9.5 / 10.Music?  Well, the songs were good and I like Phil Collins, so that was a plus.  They didn't fit as well into the movie, though.  I wouldn't classify Tarzan as a musical the same way I would classify most of the recent Disney movies as musicals, because the fact of the matter is, all the songs are background music to certain action sequences.  The characters, for the most part, don't sing.  Also there was less music than the other movies, or at least it seemed that way...  Let me put it this way: this was nowhere near The Little Mermaid in musical quality - the songs seemed to be a gesture rather than central to the movie.  7/10.Humor.  Truth be told, Disney Animated movies haven't been comedies for a long time.  But there are enough funny sight gags and such to keep the tone of the movie light even at serious moments.  Kind of what you would expect. 8/10.Lastly, we come to the plot.  The plot is actually important in this kind of movie - the Lion King wouldn't have worked at all without its plot. However, Tarzan falls significantly short of the excellent mark we have come to expect from Disney.  The story is pretty simple to start - A mother and father with their baby get shipwrecked, and live in a home on the shore. Unfortunately, the parents are killed.  At the same time, a gorilla loses her baby to a leopard.  The gorilla finds the baby human, and takes him back to the family to raise him.  The boy, of course, is Tarzan.  As he grows up, he has problems fitting in - the other youngsters don't accept him, and neither does the head of the family, Kerchak.  Eventually, he learns that he's human, when he meets Jane and her father and their guide, Clayton. Then, he struggles to decide whether he belongs with his family or with the humans that are clearly more like him.Up until this point, the story is nothing short of charming.  Then, Disney adds a gratuitous bad-guy (Clayton, of course, and anyone will see it coming) which completely ruins everything.  Tarzan rushes headlong into the fight which proves what?  He's brave?  He cares about his family?  We knew that already.  There was a point in the movie, right before the bad-guy part of the plot comes in, where I was actually interested.  After that, I just wasn't interested anymore.  Plot: 4 / 10.Oh yeah, one note I wanted to add - this movie should have been rated PG. Three scenes of note (that justify this comment) - at least twice in the movie, we see blood, once, we see the moment of death, not directly but directly enough that I would consider it violence.  Also, Tarzan touches Jane's breasts at one point - in an innocent way, but still.Of course, this is Disney and They Wouldn't Dare Give It A PG Rating.Overall - I enjoyed the movie, but because the thing they did with the plot was so annoying, I'm not going to be seeing it again.  I'd give it a 7/10. Disappointing for Disney, but still a good movie.",Tarzan
142,soanim8ed,Moves like liquid.,8,18 June 1999,"Well, being the big animation fan that I am, I went to see Tarzan this afternoon.  Wow.When I first heard that Disney was doing a version of the Tarzan story, I was hesitant.  I mean who wants to hear an ape man spouting out show tunes? Hakuna Matata!  The only songs are some of the best work Phil Collins has done in many years.  He ventures into the Peter Gabriel territory, but does a great job especially with the rhythms since he IS a drummer.  The open number (and sequence) is best albeit Lion King-esque.  It seems he was very inspired by the material and has rediscovered his love of music.  It's very uplifting.  Don't misunderstand me, the characters do sing, but it's more Rosie O'Donnell doing scat with the other apes as they destroy a camp and a very welcome singing cameo by Glenn Close doing the beginning of a lullaby that Phil takes over.As for the picture itself:  wow!  This is the most beautiful Disney animation ever:  lush, detailed, quick and smooth.  Tarzan moves like liquid, filling the screen with gymnastic ease especially the scene where he fights a leopard to save his ape family.And family is what this film is all about.  Disney's Tarzan makes a different decision that Edgar Rice Burroughs' and I think it works better, but it's the decision I would make in the same situation.  Some of the situations are a little contrived, but it is mostly Disney sticking with a winning formula.  (Tarzan does have nipples unlike Aladdin).  :-)  What surprised me was the dramatic tilt of the film. Rosie O'Donnell's ape and the elephant are the only comic relief and don't have much of it.  The film is very skewed towards adults; HOWEVER, as I was surrounded by a mob of kids there was dead silence right after the main gorillas lose their baby and Tarzan loses his parents to the leopard at the beginning.  All the questioning ceased and I got to enjoy the film in complete ""adult-like"" silence.  The kids were just as wrapped up in the movie as the adults.The voice talent was well cast, too.  Minnie Driver is great as the strong, yet proper British lady of the time.  Her father is a stereotypical egghead professor who is as clumsy as he is smart.  And then there is Brian Blessed as the villain, Clayton.  Man, do I love his voice! It's the Voice of God!  The deep, rich tones always give me a chill.  I wish he worked in more films other then Kenneth Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare films, but alas.... (well, I guess he WAS in The Phantom Menace)This truly is one of Disney's classics.  I felt the same way walking out of this one as I did from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.Oh, look for a cameo from Mrs. Potts and Chip from Beauty and the Beast!  I thought it was funny, but I don't think anyone else in the theater got it since I seemed to be the only one laughing.   I always embarrass myself at the movies it seems.",Tarzan
143,walter-17,Go!,7,23 August 1999,"I liked the movie.  I didn't like Minnie Driver in Good Will Hunting, but she was great in this role as Jane.It is a good movie for the family.I like Phil Collins.  However, the same voice through out the movie just did not work for me.  I was very tired of hearing Phil Collins by the time the movie ended.I gave it a 7/10",Tarzan
144,Bladerunner•,"Powerful, beautiful and moving version, marred only by it's weak villain",9,14 February 2000,"Without a doubt, this is the most visually impressive animated movie Disney has ever created. In the entire visual history of animated films, this one stands head and shoulders with the best, and above most. The concept of incorporating all or part of the actual person's face and mannerisms who provides the voice for an animated character (which Disney pioneered), has been raised to near art form in this movie. The casting of voices for the characters is excellent, and adds greatly to the impact of the animated performances. Indeed it adds immensely to the entire movie. The visual richness in this film is absolutely awe inspiring.I look for little things, that normally get overlooked, as a guide for how devoted animators are to bringing quality to the screen. For a small example of this, check out the scene (pretty early in the film) where boy Tarzan asks Terk if he can come with him to play. Terk says no, because `...you can't keep up'. The next scene Terk comes through a group of ferns and starts talking to his friends. Check out the movement of the ferns behind Terk, and also when boy Tarzan comes through them. They are incredibly detailed and are constantly moving (realistically). All this requires time, money and talent and NO WHERE in this film is that scrimped on.Deep Canvas, the new technique created by Disney, adds immeasurably to Tarzan. This film wouldn't be NEAR what it is without it. Normally for animation to occur where we follow the action `into' the frame or toward and away from you, the background has to be redrawn continuously because (for instance) elements get larger as you move toward them. This, In contrast to action that moves side-to-side where the background can be drawn once and only character cells need be redrawn. Its like moving `into' a painting, rather than back and forth across the canvas (hence the name probably).Animators rarely do much action `into' the frame, because the time and cost involved is very great. Deep Canvas uses backgrounds, hand drawn into the computer, to ""computerize"" (to an extent) this process. This not only greatly reduces the time and cost involved, but it also adds new tools at the animators disposal. Really, it allows the background to ""come alive"". It doesn't look computerized though, it looks like traditional animation. The technique resulted in many spectacular sequences in Tarzan. The scenes where he `surfs' the trees showcases just how awesome this new tool is. There is MUCH more to Deep Canvas than my over-simplified definition. There is MUCH to like in Tarzan... the visual lushness, excellent character animation and voice performances, the music (even if you aren't a Phil Collins fan, it's good) and it has an excellent sense of humor. It also shies away from the overly cute depictions of animals (as in Bambi) for more realistic ones which really took a big turn for the better in The Lion King. The sequences with babies and children (human and animal) and interactions between parent and child also rang very true, something else that began to really take off in The Lion King.Some scenes are very powerful, and will rock even adults. One scene in particular comes to mind. Directly after the fight sequence with Sabor (the leopard), Tarzan does his traditional ""Tarzan"" yell. This raised the hair on top of my head. I have found myself watching this over and over again. It's just about as perfect as animation can get. The yell itself is new and fresh, not the traditional yell we have heard so many times before (which is great, but shows it's age). Tremendous power and emotion is translated by less than six seconds of screen time. You will feel yourself fighting back your own yell, or tears when you watch this.Disney did so much right in this movie, but they continued one long, bad tradition.  Which is the weak writing and casting of the villain. Indeed the whole conceptualization and portrayal of the antagonist in Disney films, including this one, needs a massive overhaul.Alfred Hitchcock, above all others, understood how important the villain or antagonist was to a film. Hitch made the `heavy' attractive and intelligent. Often the villain was a much better person in most respects than the protagonist of the film, with only one fatal flaw marring him. The villain might be a person that you would really want as a friend or a lover, if it weren't for that ONE thing - which was a BIG thing, like he (or she) was a psycho or a traitor or a murderer. On one hand you wanted the `good-guy' to triumph, but you could identify with the villain and you often liked him more. Making the villain a desirable and multi-faceted character created incredible tension in the audience.I mention all this because this is one area where Disney REPEATEDLY fails in it's animated films, and Tarzan is no exception. The anti-hero in Tarzan is one-dimensional, and we don't identify with him in any way. He is the `bad hunter', used often as a villain in recent Disney movies, e.g., Beauty and the Beast and Pocahontas. We are drawn into the way Tarzan himself is torn between his adoptive gorilla family, and his identity with the human race. This tension is well done in the film, in every way from the writing and casting to the actual animation of emotion. We aren't however, a bit drawn in by the antagonist of the film.That aside, overall this film was GREAT. I loved it and anyone who likes animated films will love it too. Even if you don't like animation you will probably like this one. It far surpasses most if not all in recent memory. The only gripe I have is the cardboard cut-out villain. I long for more three dimensional antagonists that can get the audience thinking and emotionally involved in the struggle occurring on screen. Enrolling all the writers of the Disney animated movies in a college-level course on the films of Alfred Hitchcock could do WONDERS for their next projects. But that's about the only area where they need help. In every other way Disney is holding class, and all other feature animation studios could do well to sign up for a course or two.",Tarzan
145,loewleon,Tarzan,8,9 January 2019,"One of my favourite Disney Movies. As a child i nearly watched every Disney movie, now that im in my last Teenage years i'm about to rewatch them all and the movies i still like the most are Lion King, Jungle Book and Tarzan. Probably Robin Hood too but i haven't rewatched it yet.Tarzan is funny, interesting and brutal. There are scenes including the Silverback that even imonated me a bit. The scenes between Jane and Tarzan are even more funny for adults and i was very shocked to find out that the gorilla who grew up with Tarzan was a girl. I watched it in English for the first time today (i'm from Germany) and the dubbed version is a boy if i recall it right.8/10",Tarzan
146,rose-18,one of the absolute best animated films,10,3 July 1999,"Having seen just about every Disney animated film more than once through numerous babysitting jobs, I have very strong opinions and affections toward the films. In my opinion, the best Disney movies were Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, and Aladdin. Personally, I do not like Fantasia and while I believe Snow White is the most important to the genre, I do not especially care for it. I was thrilled last night to add Tarzan to my list of favorites, particularly in regard to the slump that Disney has been in since The Lion King. Tarzan itself. First the animation, it was gorgeous! The story unfolded great, and if some people disliked the narrative, it was likely because it has been filmed 24 times before! The characters and voices were almost all good. Minnie Driver as Jane was wonderful, completely hilarious, smart, sweet, sassy, a totally sympathetic heroine. Tarzan was good, even Rosie O'Donnell, who I expected to turn in another lame sidekick to the long Disney list made me laugh over and over. The music was wonderful, no awful Prince of Egypt junk to make me squirm in my seat! I wouldn't be surprised to have the CD wind up in my house! While it has been nice to have the characters sing, there should be room for difference, and the ""heroine singing a song about how she doesn't fit in"" has happened way too often and was good to lose! To be fair, I can state my problems, but shall preface them by saying they made little impact on the film- 1)the villain. He just wasn't that exciting or unique, but still, the real demon Tarzan was conquering was himself and who he saw himself as.2) I noticed that Disney seems to run into a pattern 3) The elephant character was kind of unnecessary.FINAL WORD: SEE IT!",Tarzan
147,BENARES-2,The best Disney movie I've seen in ages,10,21 June 1999,"When I first saw the ad for this movie, I was totally breathless at the fantastic animation shown -- could they keep it up for the entirety of the movie, I asked myself.  Also in the forefront of my mind was the nasty habit Disney had shown to me over the past eight years of providing beautiful animation but tremendously bad story, so I was expecting more of the same. And then I saw this movie.  Yes, they certainly proved they could keep up the adrenaline-pumping animation for the full length of the feature.  And more amazingly, this story was great!  It was extremely enjoyable, with very little of the kid-i-fied scenes that made ""Hercules"" a sickening experience for me.  It actually seemed more adult-oriented than many other American animated features I had seen, and yet did a good job of  not being gory or horrifically violent.  The fact that this movie was not a musical like every other Disney movie was a welcome break, too.  Overall, a great show for all ages (I mean it)!  Go see it!",Tarzan
148,Fred_Maxwell,Great Film,9,27 September 2008,"Disney brings the legendary story of the Lord of the Apes to animation with excellent results. The film follows the story of Tarzan, a young baby orphaned and alone in the jungle. After being found by a kindly gorilla named Kala, Tarzan is adopted into the gorilla family and raised as one of them. As he grows up, he attempts to prove himself to his family, most specifically the family's patriarch, Kerchak. This becomes even more difficult when more humans come into the jungle, including a spirited Englishwoman named Jane Porter. As he begins to fall in love with her, his loyalties are divided and he must choose whether to stay with his gorilla family or remain with Jane. The film is excellent, but, to me at least, doesn't seen to really take off until Jane enters the picture half way through the story. Most of Tarzan's adventures with sidekicks Terk the gorilla and Tantor the elephant near the beginning of the film are not as interesting as many of the events later on. The music by Phil Collins is great, the animation stunning, and the relationships between both Tarzan and Jane and Tarzan and his adopted-parents are also well played as well. A very well crafted film and worthy of being called one of Disney's best.",Tarzan
149,flipcritic,"As of this writing, the best film of 1999.",8,11 July 1999,"This movie draws a sense of awe throughout the entire story.  Though its plot may be formulaic, it executes better than any other formulaic movie this year.  This is the best animated film  I have seen in the last 5 years since ""The Lion King"".  The images are absolutely wonderful to look at. The music by Phil Collins is so powerful that it energizes the whole movie making you feel emotionally charged all throughout.  I feel this film could have never been made in live action, since it gives a totally new perspective on what Tarzan may actually have been like, his movement, his upbringing, and most of all, his interaction with jungle family.  The musical sequences by the gorillas were silly, but entertaining (it is a Disney film isn't it?).  And Tarzan's movement through the jungle is so spectacular that it makes Aladdin's flying carpet escape from the lamp's abyss seem pale in comparison.Though most of Tarzan's leaping, swinging, and tree surfing seem unrealistic, we have to keep in mind that this is an animated film, and since it is Disney's, thrills will be expected.  Tarzan delivers exciting thrills, fills you with awe through the entire film, without sacrificing the story and the underlying theme.  This is a WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL FILM.  Go see it.If you have to decide between Star Wars I and Tarzan, it's no contest... Tarzan is the film Star Wars I should have been.",Tarzan
150,MatrixFn,Quite possibly the best Disney cartoon ever,8,22 September 1999,"Tarzan is quite possibly the best Disney Cartoon ever.  Now that is saying a lot!Designed for children? Perhaps, but there is plenty in the movie for adults as well.The casting is excellent, as the voices really match the characters personalities.  The story flows very well form one scene to the next. There is enough going on to keep the viewer interested throughout.  In Tarzan, Disney avoids their tendency to over play the ""musical scenes.""The real beauty of the film comes in the strong emotion it captures.  The film really draws the viewer in.  One feels Tarzan's struggles to be accepted.  The turns the movie takes makes the viewer sad, then mad, and at last high again.I rate Tarzan as the 3rd best movie of 1999 (so far), behind The Matrix and and just behind October Sky.",Tarzan
151,riversol,An enjoyable Disney film which breaks Disney trends,7,1 October 1999,"I always look forward to Disney's releases with the simultaneous fear of seeing a G watered down story.  Like Mulan however, Tarzan transcends being simply a child's story with realistic and, at times, dark moments.  The shadow hanging of Tarzan's nemesis at the end is particularly eerie.  The animation and humor excel but only sometimes.  Jane and her father are flat as the pre-Copernican world, both in character and animation.  Yet this Disney film is worth seeing, if not alone for the underlying theme of wildlife preservation.",Tarzan
152,EdCurtis,Disney's newest masterpiece,10,14 July 1999,"Ok, before I start, a quick disclaimer:  This is the first ""Tarzan"" movie I've seen all the way through.  Nor have I read the books, so I can't speak for the film's faithfulness to classic Tarzan.With that out of the way, Disney's Tarzan is brilliant on its own merits. The animation, music and sound are some of their best ever -- make sure to see this on the big screen if at all possible!  The story is totally engrossing -- I only looked at my watch once through the whole film -- and the aftermath of the final battle is touching and surprising.Since this is a Disney film, the animals talk...BUT, this time there's a new spin on it.  We only hear the animals speak ""English"" when no humans are around (Tarzan excepted).  So, when Tarzan has his inevitable meeting with Jane, he doesn't speak a word of English.  The implication, then, is that the ""English"" the gorillas speak, is really gorilla-ese translated into English.  This is much like a ""Star Trek"" episode where, to save subtitle work, the Klingons speak English on one of their ships, where in actuality they'd be speaking their native tongue.  A very clever twist on a tried and true Disney cliche.In the final analysis, I truly have no complaints about Disney's Tarzan. A perfect 10.",Tarzan

I can't stress this enough.  Though the story is rushed in some places, it is easily forgiven, and the ""main"" chunk of plot still has lots of room to breathe and grow without dragging on.I also liked how Tarzan needed to be taught the English Language...I hoped Disney wouldn't cheep out on that part and give him an English accent or something.  Heheh.Even the tacked-on-bad-guy element was okay, because it offered Tarzan (already going through inner turmoil) to decide on his final course of action by having to face the Mr Evil-Guy of the day.All in all, a nearly perfect movie, and one that anyone can go to see and enjoy.  If Disney can just keep this new-found momentum instead of going back to the generic Hunchbacks and Mulans, they may actually be on to something.  Keep it up, guys! OH!  And a BIG thank-you for the design of Jane.  The animators FINALLY realized that beauty does NOT mean giant breasts and hips.  She was still stunning, though.  ^_^",Tarzan

157,Adrian-34,Wishing for more,8,4 June 2000,"May contain spoilers.Disney's Tarzan has a good, strong story with interesting characters and great talent providing the voices.  It is full of rich scenery loaded with detail.  It is a charming, family film which one would expect from Disney. However, it's one downfall is is the character artwork. 
I felt more detail would have improved the film 100 fold.  Too often, characters (especially the human ones) tend to look out of place in the pseudo-realistic scenery forcing them too look almost lampoonish, many of which practically are.  The scenery comes off as superior animation while many of the characters tend to look like excerpts from a Saturday morning cartoon misplaced amongst the rich animation of some animals and almost all scenery.  Animation fans will find many fanciful scenes that will please them, but will also find many that will disappoint them. 
In example, Kerchak is a superior piece of animation but tends to look out of place with the rest of the gorillas as none really compare to the effort which was so obviously applied to him.  Tarzan himself is simplistic from start to finish and amazingly resembles the actual artist's face who drew him.  Nor can the artist seem to decide just how defined Tarzan's muscles should be from time to time.Otherwise, the film is great.  However, some parents might find some of the violence to graphic for little ones, in particular a hanging.  The story might prove to advance for smaller children as well.",Tarzan
158,Basf-2,Not my cup of tea,5,27 October 1999,"This kind of movie is definitely not my cup of tea. Disney has allways been great at creating lovely furry little animals, and of course creatures like Donald Duck and the like. But they have allways been very bad at creating interesting human characters. And there are more and more of those in their recent films, including this one. Also, most animal characters in this film are either too ""human"" or very cliche. Finally: it has one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard; !",Tarzan

It was one of the first movies I saw on the theaters on the big screen when it was brand new and I still remember it now. Retelling the tale of a human infant raised by gorillas, this is by my standards the definitive version of the story. One thing I always enjoyed is that unlike in the original novel, the character of Sabor is not a lion, but a leopard. That is biologically correct because one, lions do not actually live in the jungle and two, in an environment like this, the leopard would technically be the only large animal capable on hunting a gorilla. I also cherished Wayne Knight as the cowardly elephant Tantor, which always results in the greatest jokes in the film. And the music by Phil Collins is well thought out. Highly recommended as a family film",Tarzan

We're waiting for video so we can watch it on TV with CC turned on to get the words.All in all this is a very exciting movie with genuine laughs along the way.

I had the treat to see this last night, and through it all, even the toddlers in the theater loved it!  People have said this is a breakthrough animation-wise, but story-wise, this is like mind-blowing.  Tarzan himself is the first truly deep Disney male character since ... I can't think of a really deep Disney male character, except perhaps Simba from The Lion King.  Tarzan has everything that makes you realize that, though he's raised by apes, he's truly human, and even his upbringing can't hide that (C'mon, if you were raised your whole life thinking you were an ape, and then suddenly find out you're really something else, wouldn't you also be disturbed?)From the first to the last scene was awesome.  Tarzan and the ape Kala's backgrounds were told briefly, poignantly, and emotionfully.  There's (intelligent) humor and love, which only add to the film, and there's an obvious love between Tarzan and Jane.  Someone here said they're not in love, that it's obvious, but I have to strongly disagree.  The scenes between them are funny and give you a feeling that there's a strong attraction (and not just because Jane's interested in studying apes).  And even Jane's father, though he's a small background character, he helps the plot along, and while you'd describe him as ""dithering"", he has his own funny bone (When Jane is describing Tarzan to him by drawing a picture on a blackboard, she starts to go on about his 'wonderful eyes', and in the midst of her daydream, her father comments, ""Would you like me to give you and the blackboard some private time?"" Riot!).No, Clayton's not a Jafar or a Gaston, but he's not really the enemy here; he's just an antagonist to help along Tarzan's inner conflict.  The real enemy would be Tarzan's battling against his 'true' world (the one with humans) and the one he's grown up with (the one with apes).  Clayton just resembles a threat to Tarzan's ape family.  In the past, villains were a direct challenge to the hero; here, he is a threat, sure, but he's not the whole movie here.  I like it better this way.  In real life, there's rarely a big evil soul against you, and Clayton seems like a realistic greedy, nasty guy, rather than the cliche megolamincal weirdos of most animated features.I loved Phil Collins.  And while it's great hearing Ariel sing, I think background music was better for this particular movie.  I couldn't see Jane or Tarzan singing; it makes the whole thing almost unrealistic.Tarzan himself was wonderful!  Charismatic, emotional, outgoing, and at the same time, goofy and boyish.  The scenes between him and his ape mother, Kala, were so tender.  I haven't seen such wonderful emotions in live-action movies.  And even Kerchak ... let me tell you something about him.  Even my mom said he was real.  I don't think he was too mean.  He felt threatened by Tarzan's presence.  It wasn't out of superiority.  When Kala first shows baby Tarzan to him, Kerchak is worried about the existence of other humans in the jungle, which might endanger his family of apes.  He only worries about his family, too, and I suspect that, while he keeps a stoic face over the death of his own baby ape in the beginning of the movie, he's not ready to adopt another baby (if one of your kids died, would you be so willing to adopt another right away?  I know I wouldn't).The Lion King, Mulan, and Tarzan all have the same thing in common; they all show true emotion and character, unlike the basic fairy tale fluff like Cinderella and Bambi (nothing against fairy tales, but I like to see true-to-life stuff, you know?).This is a must-see.  If Disney keeps this up, adults may start to change their views of animated stuff.  It ain't just for lil' kids anymore! :)",Tarzan
163,Polaro,Disney's at it again.,3,25 July 1999,"I'm so tired of the Disney formula. They just go through the motions. The story was bland and empty and the characters stock. And then there's those hideous, soaring Phil Collins songs.",Tarzan
164,Danny SwazZ,Not one of Disney's best,7,18 August 2001,"I have to say I was quite dissapointed by Tarzan. It just didn't hold up to Disney's standards. Instead of an interesting, original story like in classics such as The Lion King, or Mulan. Tarzan was merely a copy of every ""jungle-boy"" movie ever made.I must however hand it to this movie for being the best Tarzan I've ever seen. The music was average, but if nothing else watch it for the spectacular animation.Overall 7/10, not outrageously terrible but not bewildering.",Tarzan
165,jkmtzgr,Wish Disney did more movies like this!,8,6 July 2021,"The animation in this movie is top notch! One of Disney's best thanks to the deep canvas techniques that they used. It really makes the jungle environment come alive and it's so awesome to see how Tarzan glides through the trees!Even though it differs from the original story (kind of typical for Disney), it still tells its own version really well. The songs really elevate it with the beginning song and Son of Man being the highlights. The other songs feel like they should have been sung by the characters or maybe in their heads, but that's only a nit pick.Most of the characters are very likable especially Jane and her father. Clayton is kind of a boring villain, kind of in the same league as the villain from Pocahontas. I think either the leopard or Kerchak would have been better as the main villain.This movie still holds a special place in my heart and I still admire it all these years later!",Tarzan
166,Seifer006,A really good underrated Movie,9,13 April 2009,"This movie is perhaps misunderstood, you may look at the cover and think that it is yet another disneyfied classic ruined and altered until it has been worked into the Disney formula, this may have happened a little, but it is not about singing monkeys roaming around aimlessly...The movie is filled with so much heartache. in the beginning, When Kala loses a child the emotion conveyed in that scene was excellent. The and the scene shared between Tarzan and Jane, the feeling of the heartbeat, was worthy of any film, not just a child's film. I honestly believe that adults will get more from this story than any of the children. The story also moves rather quickly avoided the dragging on, the timing of the movie was perfect, a little short, but never a dull moment. This movie was brilliant.The technological aspects were amazing the seamless integration of 2D and 3D animation was just extraordinary. I believe that there is something for everybody in this story, a must see for Disney fans and non-fans alike.",Tarzan
167,Carmen-5,Wow...I was impressed!,8,20 June 1999,"Ok, when I first heard Disney was doing ""Tarzan,"" I was not too keen on the idea.  But, I was very surprised by how this film came together!The animation is wonderful, as is the storyline.  The movie flies by!  I loved the songs, but seeing I love Phil Collins' music anyway...I may be biased there.  :)I enjoyed the characters.  Tarzan was much more than the ""Me Tarzan.  You Jane"" type- he had a full existence.  Jane was clever, not as much the damsel that the trailers pins her as.  Tarzan's pals Terk and Tantor were amusing as well.  I noticed there was some feeling the villain (Clayton) isn't much of anything.  That's true- but I consider his presence more to further Tarzan's decision of where he belongs rather than be the main roadblock to him.I highly recommend this film!",Tarzan
168,TheEagle,"A new classic (?), but not for the kids",8,15 August 1999,"+ and - points:
+ music well integrated in movie; finally a Disney movie where the songs do not suddenly appear for the need of a song but because some music is required.Phil Collins still makes the same music as 20 years ago; we know the trick by now Phil, try something new (and NEVER EVER sing another song in a foreign language!)+ a lot of action, not just action sequences that are required to get young parents with their children in the theater.it's so much action that the Disney cuteness disappears a little. The average age of the visitor Disney aims at is increasing (children below 4 don't buy toys and the ones below 13 don't have much to spend)+ a solid story (for an American movie, that is); only the musical scene in the camp jumped out, but that one's for the toys again)
Total: This might become one of the new classics. Though it's better than missers as Pocahontas and Mulan it's not a good as the Lion King and certainly has not the class of Bambi of the Jungle Book",Tarzan
169,PAL-9,It is a very good movie and the music is great.,9,3 September 1999,"This movie combines great music, humour and a good story about friendship. Tarzan is my favourite character in the movie. You can take the entire family. Adults, all the way to grandparents,  and kids will like it very much. Asher, age 12",Tarzan
170,FilmBuph,A fine retelling of the classic tale.,5,6 July 1999,"A well told story made into a well told story.  I am not a great fan of animated features, but this one was worth the money.  The only thing keeping me from giving this a higher rating is the ham-handed preaching of ""man and animals are all the same under the skin.""  Save the philosophizing on evolution for the classroom or the home.  Don't preach to our kids by using doe-eyed animated characters.",Tarzan
171,jwga,"Adoption gets the spotlight, and sweetly done",6,9 July 1999,"Considering how Disney usually enjoys focusing on social injustices and rebellious characters, Tarzan is unusual.  This film actually speaks to the average Jane about a topic everyone has encountered to some degree and in a way that should touch any viewer.  Tarzan is a man adopted by an ape.  He has more complexity and maturity than any other Disney character to date. Sounds ironic, doesn't it?  Unfortunately, many of the other minor characters fall way short in comparison.  Phil Collins' music should touch viewers.  Overall, a very sweet and pleasant story.",Tarzan

Walt Disney has been overcome itself with this splendid movie about the Tarzan's story. It has a very good script. Action and touching moments are perfectly built and they caused in me a lot of emotions, laughing and crying.I've bought the soundtrack and I've heard it three times in two days.

175,lilmufasa2,Ending with a Bang........ TARZAN,10,15 August 2008,"Disney was basically on a scale between Great offerings and the Poor offerings of the Disney Renniscance. The great films were From Mermaid to Lion king with a little Hercules jazz. The poor offerings were Pocahantas, Hunchback, Rescuers 2, and Mulan. Going to theaters in the summer of 1999, i was ready to sit through a re-hash of Lion king and Jungle book. I was as wrong as i could be. Phil Collins did what Elton john, Tim rice, Alan Menken, Howard ashman, and the Sherman brothers had set done on the Disney canon with Phenomenal songs including You'll be in my heart, Son of man, and Strangers like me. After Tarzan (with the exception of Fantasia 2000 and The emperors new groove), I stopped watching Disney animation because it isn't exciting anymore. Tarzan ended what was set down by Little Mermaid 10 years earlier",Tarzan
176,Spider-36,One of Disney's greatest achievements,10,28 March 2000,"Tarzan is one of Disney's greatest accomplishments. It mixes various elements from Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King and Aladdin. It is a story that will touch your heart (I know it touched mine).Phil Colin's soundtrack is excellent. It perfectly embellishes on the situations in the movie and does not interfere with the story. It is a welcome change from previous Disney movies, where a mediocre song would interrupt the story for 2 or 3 minutes. The animation is quite marvelous. I never expected to see this type of animation from Disney; previously it was 20th Century Fox and Dreamworks who were the ones taking risks and introducing new innovations to animation. With this new ""Deep Canvas"" method, Disney has reached new heights. I loved the way the two principle characters, Tarzan and Jane, were drawn. Tarzan has so much depth to him; his facial expressions were numerous; he is much more than a two-dimensional figure. And Jane is simply magnificent. I never thought that I could fall in love with a drawing; but I fell in love with Jane. And kudos to Disney for casting Minnie Driver, she was perfect for the part.If Disney keeps making movies like this, I don't think I'll be able to wait for their next film!",Tarzan

178,annalisetiley,Brilliant,9,11 December 2020,"Looove this movie, one of my all time favorites. Makes me emotional when I watch it every time and the plot is genius.

179,MattGrif,Tree-swinging entertainment in the best Disney mould.,7,6 November 1999,"Well done Disney for coming up with another hit. Although Aladdin and The Hunchback of Notre Dame were superior in terms of story and general presentation, Tarzan was a vast improvement over the likes of The Little Mermaid or Pocahontas, both of which lacked the charm that we've come to expect from Disney. Vocal performances by Minnie Driver and Glenn Close were well up to standard. Nevertheless, the film is far from mould-breaking, though this seems to be a minor concern.Overall, Tarzan is an entertaining retelling of Burroughs' story.",Tarzan
180,sticky-4,Overall Entertaining,7,20 June 1999,"Disney's latest entry is full of its usual breath taking visuals and great vocal performances.  I liked: the 3D swinging sequences, Kala's rescue of the human infant, the overall character developement.Disney did well creating the main plot of a hero trying to figure out where he belongs, but the addition of the villianous Clayton seems thrown in unnecessarily, Rosie O'Donell's Terk character is far more annoying than Jar Jar could ever be.  So the big problem here is that they have a good serious story that they try to mix in with ""the usual comic relief in a Disney film"" I don't need a good story that all of a sudden has Elephants talking about how pirhana's are native to South America and other antics that just don't seem to fit this story.Kids will love this, Adults will probably enjoy it too.  But mind you this, From Little Mermaid to Mulan, the past Disney films have depicted 1 - 3 deaths in each of them, TARZAN has 6 deaths in it, and while I have never read the original story by Edgar Rice Burroughs, I found Disney's version to be very predictable.  Beauty and the Beast it ain't, but if you can watch a movie without being so nit picky you should be able to enjoy this film.",Tarzan
181,phfa,Ahhhhhhhh!!,9,19 June 1999,"This Tarzan is really good for the whole family.  Really digged how he ""surfed"" through the trees, really cool.  Minnie Driver as Jane stole the show, but everyone did a good job, with the exception of a certain loud-mouthed New York talk show host. See this movie!!",Tarzan
182,Listmstr,Three-dimensional animation,10,24 June 1999,"As the state of the art in animation, the standards get higher and the full length movies get better.  ""Tarzan"" is another leap forward.  I've never seen such three-dimensional animation.  With every scene you're looking *into* the jungle.  The scenes where Tarzan is flying, swinging, or surfing through the jungle look as if you can peer into it for ever.The characters are exciting and fun to watch, as is usual for Disney animated features, but seldom in those features do you see such growth and such *depth* in a character as you do with Tarzan's struggle to win his place in his troop.  You come to understand Kerchak over the course of the movie.  Only the villain seems flat and one-dimensional.See this one on the big screen, if you can.",Tarzan

185,conqueror6,good...,9,18 November 2000,"the animation was good, if not great, and as an animation student, I pay close detail to it. It was another good display of Disney's talent.

186,conqueror6,cool,9,10 January 2002,"I've always loved animated movies, and even went to school for animation, so naturally I would like this, but when I found out they used Lance Henriksen's voice, it rose a notch. It had great effects, a splash of modernism which is always refreshing, and the mood was fitting, for a Disney film.",Tarzan
187,Disneylover34,Phil Collins is not for everyone.,6,10 August 2021,"It's obvious, the biggest issues with this movie arrive from its use of Phil Collins as its main artist. If you don't like Phil, you will not like this movie or it will extremely hard to stomach. Other issues with this movie include the moral of the story, ""Do what you believe is right"". However, the movie Clearly shows what Tarzan believes is wrong, as his adopted father dies from what Tarzan believes in. This is never really addressed and the film just seems to be content with this very contradictory statement. The characters however are fun. The Villian is slightly memorable just for his death in the film. Some of the voice casting is horrible including Rosie O'Donnell who never gets a laugh as long as the movie runs. This movie has considerable upside but contains some extreme flaws that are not addressed in the slightest.",Tarzan
188,caradryanmusic,"Good looking movie, but a tonal mess!",6,16 November 2018,"I have a love and hate relationship with this movie. On the one hand I love it, the visuals are stunning and the jungle looks lush and enchanting and the story is great, but the movie falls apart for me in tone and thanks to the mis-use of Phil Collins' music.The best example for this is the opening scene where we follow the misfortunes of Tarzan's family. During all of this they play Collins' song, it's a good song on its own but in my opinion a mismatch to the events shown on screen, which are dramatic to say the least. This takes me out of the movie and unfortunately this happens almost all the time Collins' songs kick in.
The songs just seem to belong in a different movie.I also find the tone of the movie to be very inconsistent switching from very dark and moody to lighthearted sillines all the time. Clayton for example is basically being played for laughs untill the very last moment that he attacks the Gorilla's and then turns into the maniacal Disney villain of old. The leopard was more of a threat and less forgettable than Clayton.However I do like the movie but I think it's the weakest one out of the Disney Renaissance period.But I will always be thankful for the hillarious line:
""Is this water sanitary?""
Something me and my friends use all the time!",Tarzan
189,rjung,"Should have been called ""George of the Jungle""",5,21 June 1999,"Maybe it's me, but when I step into a movie called ""Tarzan,"" I expect to see feats of heroic daring-do by Burroughs' King of the Jungle, heavy on the action and adventure.  But between all the slapstick jokes, goofy gags, and screwball sidekicks, this movie should have been called ""George of the Jungle"" instead.While ""Tarzan"" is not one of the worst movies of all times, it is another letdown from Disney (especially following the more sophisticated ""Mulan"") and an insult to the Tarzan mythology.  The Disney formula is running on all cylinders here, and the more serious themes of acceptance and tolerance are ignored by the meandering plot whenever it's convenient.Not bad for a budget matinee, but they really should correct the title.",Tarzan
190,harpo-14,Good time!,10,25 June 1999,"Very, very clever..excellent casting..everything Disney quality, but I never knew TARZAN was such a horney one, baby....It sounded like ROSIE had fun.

192,ASHfan,Disney has done it again!,10,24 June 1999,"Well this is a great comeback from Disney. Great animation, I love that waterfall in the background. The idea of Tarzan as a skateboarder or rollerblader was cool. The movie just kept me at the edge of the seat all the time. It was a blast, the movie was hilarious at times, sad at times, and tearful at times. I came out with puffy eyes because it was soo good. Tarzan has an all-star cast. Contributing voices like Glenn Close, who I think did a wonderful job in projecting her voice and she really sounded like Tarzan's mother. And how can anybody forget the voice of Kerchak??? Gosh, that dark, voice of Lance Henriksen is just perfect. He was perfect as the fearless, bold, and courageous leader of the gorillas. Tony Goldwyn is just fantastic. Rosie was funny as ever and Wayne Knight as the worry some elephant. Minnie Driver as the quirky daughter of Porter. I truly recommend that people go see it. I went mainly to hear Lance but it turned out I loved the whole story and movie. I gave it a 10.",Tarzan

I did find this movie a little scary for children between ages 4 and 8.  It shows a couple of gruesome scenes, albeit by illusion.  I really liked the story and characters though, especially Tantor (""Is this water sanitary?  It looks questionable to me."")  The classic story of two opposites meeting and finding a way to be together work perfectly!  I was also glad to see a father and mother both present.  Must see!",Tarzan

Why did no other producer ever think that someone brought up in the jungle without the benefits of shampoo and conditioner would naturally have dreadlocked hair?!?Someone has bemoaned the lack of any native (human) Africans in the film - but that's missing the point.

This film is set on the classic books about 'Tarzan of the Apes' by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and is a Disney film not to be missed. It is filled with show stopping humor, mostly thanks to the hilarious Rosie O' Donnell, voicing the lovable Terk, and Wayne Knight as Tantor. The story is beautifully told with great music by Phil Collins, and is one of Disney's finest. In my collection, it's my 7th favorite, which is pretty good, considering I have about 60 Disney videos. As you can tell I'm an enormous fan, and that's why I'd recommend any Disney film, particularly this adorable classic. Tarzan is not to be missed.",Tarzan

(Minnie Driver) plays the voice of Jane and oh my gosh this character is the funniest alongside Terk (played by Rosie O Donnel).Another big reason to watch this film is because of its soundtrack. The long time famous Phil Colins explodes with songs like Son of Man, Stranger Like Me, Two Worlds and Award Winning You'll be in my heart.With all the vine swing, ape yelling and jungle madness this fabulous art masterpiece is sure to be fun.",Tarzan
200,koala_t_98,"Good movie, but not exactly Burroughs",8,23 July 2020,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and then just recently re-watched it. While it's not a bad movie (actually, it's quite good in its own right,) it is NOT the story that Edgar Rice Burroughs told in ""Tarzan of the Apes. For one thing, his parents were not survivors of a shipwreck, they were put ashore in Africa by mutineers who had taken over the ship. In addition, the baby wasn't born until some time after their being stranded there. One of my main objections to this story is the continual reference to the apes as gorillas. Anyone who has read the book would know that they were not gorillas or chimpanzees, they were, simply, apes. Burroughs made that point more than once in his novels. Also, I don't understand why the film-makers decided to use the wrong name for the leopard. Sabor was the name the apes used for lionesses, with Numa being the name for lion, and Sheeta the name for leopards. I could go on about any number of changes from the book, but I will leave it where it is.
Movie-makers have NEVER made a Tarzan movie that tells the story that Burroughs did. It's a disappointing fact, because ERB's story does have the elements that make for a good movie.
Because this is NOT the Tarzan story that's told in Burroughs' books, I can only give this film a rating of 8. As I stated at the start, it's actually a good movie in its own right. But it's NOT Edgar Rice Burroughs' story of the man raised among apes.",Tarzan
201,Tremaine,Fantastic! Another Disney Classic,10,24 June 1999,"Again Disney shows they are the tops in animation. Great music, fun characters and breath-taking CGI work make one of the most true to Burroughs original story adaptations ever.So what if you get the background of the story in a ten minute rap-up. Do you want to sit for hours getting the background so the story can finally begin? In media res, is the term I think that applies here.Thank goodness there are no ""cute fuzzy"" sidekicks just for the kiddies. Terk and Tantor are very real characters that help move the plot and along and are not just comic releaf. Maybe Disney will get the hint that family entertainment is for all of the family to enjoy, not talk down to the kids. Bugs Bunny is a classic example of humor that grows on you and is funny at different ages for different reasons. The action is fast paced and the kids should not be bored with what is going on.The music is by Phil Collins and Mike Mancia. Great, fantastic wonderful! Enough said. Buy the CD.This is a fun, entertaining movie that I can't wait to own on Video. Two thumbs way up on this one....",Tarzan
202,TcH-3,Worst Disney Movie,1,4 July 1999,This was the worst Disney movie I've ever seen. Took my two granddaughters and they were bored. Disney seems to want to pump out the movies without putting any thought to them. Animation was flat. Wasted my money.,Tarzan
203,Bookman-2,E.R.B. would've love this!!!,10,19 June 1999,"I first found the Tarzan books over 30 years ago and have since, read each one at least twice. I have seen every movie, read every comic book, every newspaper funny and almost every word written about the Apeman. Until now, all of the media, except for the books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, have been a joke, not having been true to the original at all, but now, probably the closest to the original story has been made and it is a cartoon. But what a cartoon!!! Tarzan is a glorious movie in it's own right, cartoon or not. This is a movie for adults as well as children. The story is great, the visuals are superb and magnificent, the soundtrack (by Phil Collins) is unmatched, and overall, this is an experience that everyone should partake of! Everyone!!! Don't miss it!!!!",Tarzan

205,likemovi,"Great, Beautiful animation",10,6 July 1999,The movie is great.  I loved it so much that I sat thru it twice before I left.  The animation is very good and the songs by Phil Collins are good.,Tarzan
206,Jerry73,Disney's formula is getting old.,6,10 July 1999,"This film has a strong beginning and ending. Too bad the middle was nothing more than the usual Disney shlock for kids only. It was nice to see Disney take a chance with the scene where Tarzan is found and the untimely end of the villain, however,  the villain himself was a stock Disney character and is one of the weakest points of the movie. Unfortunately, as long as Disney keeps raking in the money the formula will probably stay the same. Not nearly as good as Beauty and the Beast or The Hunchback of Notre Dame.",Tarzan
207,Foolish,Squeezing a Cash Cow Dry,2,3 February 2000,"This film represents everything wrong with the Disney money machine.  It plays like a set up for an animated, Saturday morning cartoon show.  It feels like an attempt to remake (and cash in on) the success of Disney's own 'The Lion King.'That said, the animation is wonderful.  Tarzan himself is AMAZINGLY WELL ANIMATED and the violence is handled as well as I've ever seen in a Disney feature.  The computer animation and cell animation work very well together, but the pacing, story and the out of place music ruin what might have been a good animated telling of the Tarzan legend.I grew up reading the Tarzan books.  I loved them.  They rank right up there with other ""young adult"" fiction like ""Treasure Island"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""  All of these books are classics for a reason -- they are good.  They are great as they are, and terrible when rewritten.  I am aware that a film (especially one aimed at an ""all ages"" audience with a running time under two hours) can't tell the story in the same way as the book.  Movies must trim things.  But to trim the story to the point that there is almost nothing of the original left is an insult to the audience paying to see a film based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic.  What makes it even worse is all the stuff that was ADDED to the story.   None of it any good. What's left isn't 'Tarzan', but something else masquerading as it.This movie was well animated, but lacked an interesting story based on the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs (who created Tarzan in his ""pulp"" novels). It plays out more like a music video for the first ten minutes and when it finally slows down and tries to actually tell it's story, it mucks it all up with irritating animal characters (voiced by talented people) spewing forth some of the worse dialogue I've ever heard in a Disney feature.  The whole film plays like an attempt to capitalize on 'The Lion King' formula. Almost none of the jokes are funny and even fewer characters are memorable.  This movie is only slightly better than the Bo Derek version ('Tarzan the Ape Man').I feel sorry for the animators, because ever 15 minutes or so there was a scene that felt ""right.""  Unfortunately, each of these scenes is lost in a formulaic mess of a movie.  I kept getting the feeling that each of these ""good"" scenes (like Tarzan fighting the leopard or the death of the villain) was what the animators WANTED the whole film to be like, but the Disney executives just wouldn't let them play ball.  It is with a head hung low that I say that I would recommend this film to NO ONE.Watch 'The Jungle Book' instead.  Only loosely based on it's source material as well, but infinitely more entertaining, with one memorable scene after another (and GREAT songs)!",Tarzan
208,acsjacks,"A break through for Disney, a treasure for audiences",9,24 November 1999,"Animation has evolved. From the simple, yet thoughtfully drawn early Disney gems, to the less influential 80's and early 90's films, to...now. Tarzan is just the beginning of this new era of ground breaking animated technology. Much improved from other 90's Disney movies, with better animation, a perfect cast, and a well drawn out plot and, overall, a great family experience. Oh, and may I add, the perfect person to provide a soundtrack, Mister Phil Collins!",Tarzan
209,ChristianJamesLeonard,"Great to look at and listen to, but formulaic and a little shallow.",7,8 June 2009,"In Tarzan, the title character is adopted and raised by apes after his mother and father are killed. He feels as if he doesn't belong as he grows up, and these feelings come to the surface once humans arrive in the jungle.The movie is beautifully animated. With lush backgrounds and creative character designs, the art style is eye-catching. Motion is fluid and a joy to watch during thrilling action sequences and Tarzan's movement like an animal.Broadway-style singing is absent in this feature, replaced by background music that Phil Collins composed and sings. His lyrics narrate the story, and the tunes are catchy enough to stand well on their own. Voice acting is good, with Minnie Driver standing out as Jane, making her charming and likable. On the other hand, Rosie O'Donell as a gorilla named Terk is out of place and grating.The storyline doesn't hold up well. Tarzan questioning his place among the apes is a good idea and the love story between him and Jane is cute, but neither is explored with enough depth. Comic relief sidekicks, the love story itself, and the final confrontation with the villain (who feels needless) point to a typical Disney formula. The third act with the bad guy is predictable and far too convenient.However, Tarzan is still very entertaining, lightening things up with humor and action. It's delightful to look at, but probably won't be looked at as a classic.",Tarzan

213,WlfPc187,"A ""Whole New Experience""...",9,17 July 1999,"I just saw Tarzan last week, and I can summarize it in one word... WOW. Disney broke all the limits and records with this movie. The 3-D animation they incorporated into it only further enhanced an already beautiful movie, in both storyline and animation. It was unlike (literally) any other Disney movie I have seen to date.The animation alone is worth seeing the movie for. From the stunning trees that seem to ""pop out"" at you, to the breathtaking water animation, this movie is the epitome of an animated masterpiece. Forget ""Snow White"", push ""Lady and the Tramp"" out the way, because Tarzan deserves an instant spot in the Disney Masterpiece collection.The storyline is very well written... which is unusual for a Disney movie. There were scenes in which I wanted to cry (very few movies can do that), and there were also the scenes where you want to laugh your head off. It was a very well balanced movie in terms of emotional scenes.In characterization, Terk had to be my favorite... she portrays a VERY typical ""best friend"" type in the way she behaves around Tarzan. In some respects, however, Terk was also the proverbial ""stick in the mud"" of the movie. Her unwillingness to help Tarzan near the end was, in my eyes, cruel and uncalled for. Rosie O'Donnell was the perfect choice for her, in every aspect.So, with all the above in mind, I give the movie my personal rating: ******½ out of a seven star system. Fine family fun for everyone.",Tarzan

215,VioletNurikoYume,A compelling animated piece that stirs emotion...,10,25 June 2002,"There are a great many things that I could say about Disney's latest Tarzan venture, but as many of them would descend into incoherent and tearful babbles after a few moments, I do think I'll refrain.  However, there are a few things about this movie that I WILL mention.This movie made me cry.  This is not, however, because I am a weepy sap of a girl who bursts into tears at the slightest provocation--no.  I did not cry at the ending of ""Ghost,"" nor ""Titanic.""  The latter, as a matter of fact, made me more nauseous than anything, and believe me, it wasn't seasickness. Nonetheless, this movie made me cry--and more than once.
It was quite a stirring blow to my self-esteem, believe me, to find myself crying at an animated movie--and a DISNEY animated movie, for that matter--but time and ample consideration have led me to a few possible reasons for this emotional explosion.First of all, the animation is very well-done.  Most astonishing was the amount of expression and emotion that was able to be put into the faces of the apes, but really, everything was beautifully-drawn.Secondly, the talents of the voice actors did a great deal to inject emotion into their respective scenes--Minnie Driver and Rosie O'Donnell were easily my favorites in that area, but I didn't notice any flaws in any of the others, either.Then, of course, there is the MUSIC.  If there is anything at all that makes Tarzan worth seeing, it's this.  Whether one of Phil Collins' amazingly-emotional vocal tracks, or one of the beautiful instrumentals, the music adds so much to what might otherwise be mediocre character interactions, and ""You'll Be In My Heart"" has a bad habit of leaving me buried in a mound of Kleenex.Finally, and probably most importantly, we come to the plot.  Now, there IS a love story involved in this story, as there is in basically every Disney film in existence, but for me, it took a back seat to the more interesting and emotional problem of Tarzan's ""family.""  If there was anything in this movie that made me cry, it was the relationship between Tarzan and his ape mother.  ""You'll Be In My Heart,"" which I originally thought (before having seen the movie) to be a love song between Tarzan and Jane, now has taken on a great deal more emotional meaning for me.  It is, after all, a lullaby, sung to Tarzan by Kala to comfort both him and herself, and the sentiments of it--""I may not be with you, but you've got to hold on,"" ""Why can't they understand the way we feel?  They just don't trust what they can't explain,"" etc.--make it the best kind of love song.Well, I'd say this review has gone on for long enough.  So, to close, I'll simply say that Tarzan is one of my all-time favorite Disney movies, despite how deeply it cut into my tissue supply, and definitely worth watching, even if you aren't a big fan of animation.",Tarzan
216,bullrot,"the legend continues, should we follow?",7,2 March 2004,"Tarzan gives us all a nice animation film about a baby raised by gorillas, his childhood up to a man. But the kind of animal he really is, doesn't seem to be as friendly as he and his family is. Should he be a man or an ape, a difficult choice when a woman is around. I think you can't loose time when you're watching this one but i would rather consider dreamworks top productions such as Shrek or monsters.inc. I can't help to compare every animation picture with these two and by this I can see two shortcomings. First of all there's not a lot to laugh about which is to me imperative nor couldn't I help to be disappointed about the ending. The story goes in a much faster tempo then before which destroys a bit the wonderful feeling you probably get in the first hour. A smile isn't far away, a grin maybe, but never really funny. i gave a seven to this one but I must say that i gave sometimes a point more then the average of all of you.",Tarzan
217,kim-63,Tremendous,9,21 June 1999,"I have already promised my 7 year old that he will see this movie as many times as he wants and may go a few more on my own.  It is that good!Granted there are a few things I would change, but overall the best thing Disney has done in years!   Normally, my order of examination would be the story-which was ok in this film, not great but definitely better and closer to the original than most of their works in the past few decades it seems. The score, which is great.  I must say I wasn't impressed with about half the soundtrack until I saw it with the movie.  Then it all makes sense.  I did have one minor complaint that there were a couple of times I thought it, and maybe the entire movie borrows a bit heavily on Lion King.  But Disney generally tends to stock scenes and music, especially cranking out a new animated every year. What I am really going to rave about is the animation.  Not only the Deep Canvas system used to generate the layouts, but the care given to alot of the hand drawn non-character animation.  There were times I experienced almost a deja-vu from movies such as Fantasia, Bambi and the Jungle Book, in terms of the layouts.  Hunchback had some dynamic effects, but it and many of its contemporaries could have used a bit more attention in terms of the canvas the entire movie is acted upon.  In Tarzan, the jungle is as much a character of the movie as any standard character.As far as the character animation goes, Glenn Keane has raised the standard for what a character should be by leaps and bounds! Between his animation and Tony Goldwyn's voice the character honestly breathes!!!!  He is without a doubt the most vivid animated character I've ever seen.  Unfortunately next to him, Jane seems a bit flat in a few spots though Minnie Driver's pert English miss is wholly enchanting.  The villain is weak, and in truth we could have done without him, but he does help keep to the story.  I just would have liked to see him approached differently.Overall a new high for Disney---9",Tarzan

My kids are still talking about it.I was glad Disney didn't feel the need to introduce some demon-like, character in this movie like they have done in many of their other animations.Disney must know they have a winner here.

But recently, with flops as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules (which I throughly detested) after some hits like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and the Lion King... it's nice to see Disney finally bringing itself up with Mulan and Tarzan.The animation, like that of Mulan, is just spectacular.  Though more computer animation is being used, it's getting really hard to tell what is hand-drawn and computer generated now.  The characters are refreshing, but the art is what did it for me.  I had the privilege of seeing the movie with a group of those who worked on the movie's animation and I could not stop praising their accomplishment.  The three years of work put into Tarzan really showed by the product that was released... it was a complete joy to watch.  I hope that the same effort that was put into Tarzan will be reflected in Fantasia 2000, Atlantis, and Kingdom of the Sun.",Tarzan

Hilarious and moving - heartfelt but action-packed, it's the perfect Disney.",Tarzan
221,pedro64,"Action, action, great story, and more action",10,25 November 1999,"After being tantalized by trailers at the cinema, I can safely say that Disney's Tarzan is everything I expected it to be and more. Despite my initial shock to vocals of Phil Collins, from the start to finish I was gripped, even the different music style seemed to perfectly merge with the amazing visuals on screen. If you haven't seen a glimpse of the vine surfing then you have yet to see the extremely fast yet silky smooth animation. People have complained about the fact of too much computer interaction in an animated feature, but it is merged so well with the characters and backgrounds that it is very hard to tell where the computer comes into play.The story more than backs up the stunning visuals and you hardly notice that this is yet another feature of an isolated youth setting out and defying all odds. Jane, by far the best female Disney character in a long time, is a blatant English stereotype, but is pulled off so well that it is immediately accepted and humorous. She even makes it into most of the speed animation, the end needs to be seen to be believed.Action, story, character, animation, it has it all. Disney will need to create some animation masterpiece to beat this latest offering.",Tarzan
222,kwyjibo2,One of Disney's finest.,10,27 November 1999,"I will admit, after Disney's recent disappointing offerings (Mulan, Hunchback, Pocahontas) I was skeptical about this animated film.  Being a huge Phil Collins fan, his music was the only reason I went to see this film.  I am happy to say that my fears about this film disappeared as soon as ""Two Worlds"" was played. Tarzan has superb animation with the perfect blend of computer animation and traditional ink and cell seamlessly blended together.  The voice cast was superb and conveyed their respective characters very well.  The plot had the perfect mix of action, comedy, romance, and drama to satisfy my tastes, and, of course, I loved the music (I still can't get ""You'll Be In My Heart"" out of my head)! This film proves that you don't have to be a young child to fully enjoy and appreciate a Disney animated flick!",Tarzan
223,surfchic-4,Disney has lost its mind if this is a Disney movie,1,8 March 2007,"This signifies the initial and complete demise of the Disney franchise. I liked this movie the first time it came out, when it was called 'Jungle Book' and i liked it again when it was the live action version called 'George of the Jungle.' This was a Phil Collins ruinination of all things Disney. His song has ruined all things animated for me. Think about it: the Lion King to TARZAN? Me Jane, You crappy movie. This movie had nothing funny and it tried way to hard to be poignant and ended up being pedantic and confusing and overly full of blasé, cliché, over done rhetoric. The animation was substandard to say the least, after Toy Story, you expect the animation skills to go up not into the basement. The characters were overdone yet they felt very elementary and the 'acting' would have been better had actual monkeys performed the parts.",Tarzan
224,pineapple0808,Watched this the other day and realised just how good it is!,10,29 May 2009,"Tarzan came out back in 1999 when i was very young. When i first saw it I couldn't really appreciate it because I did not fully understand what was going on in the movie. Thankfully, I recorded Tarzan off of the T.V the other night and got some friends over to watch it. I love watching old animated movies, they bring back so many memories and i prefer them to 3D movies of today. Anyway, we all got comfy and started to watch this movie, not knowing whether we would like it or not. Immediately, we all became glued to the screen, as the beginning is pretty powerful, and the music is amazing! The music along with the beautiful animation is enough to give anyone goosebumps. The story is very good and consistent throughout this whole film, and is also very funny. We found ourselves laughing pretty hard at certain parts of this movie(having a random teenage sense of humour helps) and overall thoroughly enjoyed it.Don't turn your nose up at this movie because it's a cartoon ""for kids"" because i promise you, even if your 97 years old you will appreciate this movie in some way. It's so good and brings back the memories. I will definitely be watching this with my kids when I'm older :)",Tarzan
225,itjstagame,Loved this movie but can see how it hinges on liking Phil Collins,9,3 December 2010,"I love this movie, but read the other reviews first and they have a good point. Part of my loving this movie were all the Phil Collins song, the emotion they generate in you and the awesome pictures to go with it. A good 1/3 of it is music video and I think it's awesome and I love it, but I guess if you hate Phil Collins I can see how that'd sour you.Personally my kids enjoy it. Granted they prefer princesses and there aren't any here, but the monkeys are cute and enjoyable and the jungle looks 'fun'.I guess the 'point' of the story isn't as obvious here as it's more just reactions to the 'bad guy'. This movie is more about images and less about speaking, though I do admit the fact Tarzan starts speaking in an American accent doesn't seem factually accurate, but who's that pedantic about cartoon accuracy.Not the best Disney but certainly one of my favorites.",Tarzan
226,metalgodalex,Could be worse,6,14 August 2017,"Certainly one of the best Disney movies of the last twenty years. The character design is quite good, animation are kinda perfect or - better - futuristic for the year, the dubbing works well and the ""pop-ing"" soundtrack is not that bad as well, this added to the funny moments makes of this movie freely inspired to Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes a nice media for kids and easy romance lovers.Now you're going to say wow this movie is perfect, right? And I'll reply you ABSOLUTELY NOT. This movie is far from perfection for quotes to movies that '99 kids wouldn't be able to understand like the baboons scene that mention Birds from Hitchcocks; on another side the easy happy ending, which is a great difference from the book, brutally cut the pathos on the last scene. OK it's Disney and it's a family movie but a little bitter never killed anyone. Speaking of the difference from Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel, Jane and prof. Porter teach Tarzan about civil life out of the jungle using a series of slides when in the book, Tarzan learn himself due to his intelligence. Don't know you but to me this scene looks like Clockwork Orange's brainwash scene where scientists works on Alex's mind to rebuilt it, or if you prefer like ""your own study with books is less meaningless let us tell you what about the world"" which is such a bad lessons for kids that personally I kinda hate that.In conclusion, if you're looking for a classic kid movie with nice drawing and animation you're quite welcome but if you're looking for a good book transposition or a quality and wise movie keep seeking.",Tarzan

229,Upperair,Tarzan for Adults more than the kiddies.,8,28 June 1999,"Tarzan is a movie for kids of all ages. Phil Collins music opens this movie up for adults and breaks the tradition of the stars having to sing. This opens the way for more action to take place. The animations are amazing and all the voices fit their animated counterparts well. I want to see this movie again and again. This is one that you won't have to find a kid to go see it with. Actually go see it with the least amount of children, so you can enjoy it better without the baby goo goo. The kids lost interest while the adults were fascinated. Go see this movie, no hype here, just pure movie.",Tarzan
230,Leo-90,it has its ups and downs,7,18 June 1999,"First, the film:Disney strives for more realistic, 3d, lush backgrounds...and generally succeeds.  Reversing an unfortunate trend, they also started putting a little depth to the characters themselves, but...Col. Hathi and Kaa are not terribly realistic animals -- what are they doing in Tarzan?!  And have there been any recent Disney males that did NOT have a nose defined by a 30/60/90 triangle?It seems to me that Disney should return to some of the more stylized backgrounds to match their animation -- SLEEPING BEAUTY, for example, unless they are going to attempt to use the very contrast between realistic character and cartoon actor as part of the story.Second, the music:I found the ""soundtrack"" to be unexceptional, and the use of the pop star's music to be repulsive.  Sorry, Phil Collins' fans, but it didn't fit. Either have a character sing it, or at least have it ""in the style"" of the film -- not in the style of a modern pop singer.Third, the story:I went into the theatre having never seen or read any other TARZAN stories or films.  What was the story that they were trying to tell?  It seems to me that there were several different stories -- fine -- but they failed to really tell any of them -- not so fine.",Tarzan
231,saxangel,"A work of art, Took my breath away!",10,19 June 1999,"I am a big fan of disney movies and I do believe that they  have really out done themselves this time. The animation was, to say the least, SPECTACULAR! I have kept with Disney my whole life and this one is by far their best yet. It will be very hard to top, you can be sure of that.The only thing that I would have to say against this movie is that it is certainly not a children's movie. Over the years, Disney has gotten away from making animated movies that are appropriate for younger audiences. Ever since ""The Huntchback Of Notre Dame,"" Disney has included material that is in some way too mature for younger viewers. I am referring to the scene where Claton hanged himself. They did the best they could with the scene, however I believe that a child would still have trouble relating to what occurred on the screen.However, as an adult I greatly enjoyed the movie. The story line itself was excellent and the animation was fabulous. My favorite part was the music. I loved the way Phil Collins used the music to tell the story. The percussion helped to bring out the jungle atmosphere. I especially liked ""Trashin' the Camp."" I wish there were some way to put that on stage LIVE.I only have one more thing to say. TO DISNEY: Congratulations on a job well done!",Tarzan
232,jaynest,Overall: VERY good!,10,23 June 1999,"First (and most striking) about Disney's Tarzan is the animation.  Disney has definitely pushed the envelope forward in this groundbreaking display of beautiful animation.  The jungle, indeed each individual vine, has incredible depth and the lighting and coloring is fabulous!  The pioneering ""deep canvas"" effect has rendered Disney's great animation unparalleled! Truly, the animation in Tarzan is of a caliber never before seen.  On a side note, one of the previews played at my showing of Tarzan was for ""The Iron Giant"" by Warner Brothers.  The animation in this preview was of the kind you might see on a Saturday morning cartoon . . . it certainly makes you appreciate the magic in Disney animation, UNPARALLELED!The music standing alone was pleasant, a nice set of songs . . . in context with the lush and powerful animation, the Phil Collins melodies are PERFECT for the film, I would say nothing less than fabulous!  The narrative form of the songs is also a nice touch.The characters are good and the storyline is fair.Overall, Tarzan is VERY good, even GREAT!9 out of 10!(If for nothing else, see this movie for its animation)",Tarzan
233,Scott-173,Great Movie,10,21 June 1999,"My wife and I saw it last night and we loved it.  The animation is amazing - Disney just keeps topping itself.

A definite must see for any age.",Tarzan
234,llebanna,Excellent!,10,21 June 1999,One of the best Disney animations in a long time! It brought out such emotion as I watched. And there was lots of action. I could see my child at the edge of her seat waiting for what was going to happen next. Excellent movie!,Tarzan
235,Cat23,SEE THIS FILM!,10,23 August 1999,"If you see only one film this summer, forget ""Star Wars"" (and I liked ""Star Wars"").  See ""Tarzan.""This movie is visually breathtaking and emotionally gripping.  There was not a single moment that jolted me out of the world the animators created, which is not something I can say of many movies.  I cared about Tarzan and his ape family very much; they are a beautiful symbol of adoptive relationships. All of the main characters are very well developed through art and voice; I particularly liked Lance Henriksen (sp?) as the silverback Kerchak, and Glenn Close is quite touching as Tarzan's mother Kala.  The backgrounds are stunning and very real, rendered in a 3D fashion.  I also liked that the music was provided as backdrop, instead of having characters breaking into song; while that worked well for ""The Little Mermaid,"" it would have seemed very out of place here.  I get shivers from the opening montage (""Two Worlds"") and just love the ""Son of Man"" sequence: wraps up Tarzan's whole maturing process in 3 minutes!  Just brilliant.What I liked best was that, unlike in ""The Jungle Book"" where the decision to send Mowgli back is made by the animals, in this film Tarzan is an adult and allowed to/has to make the choice of which world he will embrace on his own.  Moreover, everyone else will accept his decision, whether they agree with it or not.  That makes the choice so much more important and powerful. Great stuff.Overall: fabulous film.  Solidly my second favorite Disney now, after ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Go see it!!",Tarzan
236,ElBenito,"Same Disney pap, Different Day",5,12 June 2000,"It's deja vu all over again.  For the sake of being another Disney movie, Tarzan easily falls into the fallacy of not being different enough from whatever Mouse-backed cookie cutter cartoon that I was told to see last year.  I couldn't bring myself to shell out over $7 to see this movie at the theaters, but was more than happy to borrow it for free.  When life dictated that I had to leave in the middle of it, I felt no regret that I missed the second half of the movie.  Don't get me wrong, Tarzan was a very nice movie. Standing on its own, it would present a worthwhile entertainment option. But unfortunately after catching some of the other assembly line productions that Disney's churned out over the last ten years, you can't escape the overwhelming sense that you're spending 2 hours in the grip of the world's greatest merchandising machine.  Tarzan folds not due to any faults as a movie, but under the massive weight of all of the junk poised to hit the stores before the movie ever debuted.",Tarzan
237,kshaw,"Good movie, but not really Tarzan",8,4 March 2000,"Overall it's a good movie, it was really funny, and if I hadn't read the book I would've loved it.  I understand that it's Disney and they couldn't very well show the flesh eating but there wasn't much of the book in there.If you've read the book and want to see the movie, beware; don't expect to find the book.  If you haven't read the book, watch and enjoy the movie, but don't read the book afterwards.",Tarzan
238,d-vassilev-1,Why didn't they make sequels?,9,20 October 2014,"Of all the animated movies Disney has done, the one with the richest source material and the most franchise potential didn't get sequels... theatrical sequels, that is. Go figure. Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of the Barsoom series, wrote over 20 novels about Tarzan - the filmmakers had tons of source material to choose from and adapt into movies. Not only that, but the movie was a hit at the box office. I may not have read the novels, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of stories that will make great movies. Especially since animation is the only format that can do the character justice - this movie is living proof of that. The animation is just phenomenal - Tarzan's movements, the action scenes, the angles, the artwork - it's just a visual marvel. The performances and the characters are also great - Tony Goldwyn and Minnie Driver have great chemistry as Tarzan and Jane, Brian Blessed brings a lot of personality and awesomeness to an otherwise generic and clichéd villain and other supporting cast members such as Lance Henriksen, Glenn Close, Wayne Knight and even Rosie O'Donnell do fine in their roles as well. Is the movie perfect? No. While I do love the actors playing them, I don't think the apes should have talked (and sang) in the movie. But hey, it's an adaptation and a kids' movie, of course there are going to be changes. But that's just one nitpick in an otherwise great adventure film that was a nice starting point for a potential great franchise. Sadly, the filmmakers didn't take advantage of the plentiful source material and it's a shame.",Tarzan
239,kelvintheroo,Bad effort on Disney's part,3,1 June 2004,"As usual Disney attempts to appeal to the broadest audience possible, only this one a total mess. The parts that are supposed to be funny aren't funny at all. The supporting characters are just irritating, especially Turk and that stupid elephant. It's strange that Tarzan can slide around on tree branches without lacerating his feet. It's stranger that he can suddenly change his posture after a lifetime of walking like an ape.In real life that would have affected his posture permanently.Just Disney trying to appeal to the broadest audience possible and losing all focus in the process. At least it has some decent music here and there. I don't ever want to see this movie again.",Tarzan
240,dsaint,A pleasant step in the right direction for Disney,7,26 June 1999,"Tarzan is definitely an improvement over Disney's previous formula films. However, ultimately it is just that, another Disney formula film. It is no Cinderella, Snow White or even Robin Hood. Tarzan does offer a relief from the tedious song and dance numbers that plagued their previous efforts. It was enjoyable seeing them in the Little Mermaid but that was when they were new.Tarzan continues the transparent story tradition Disney has enjoyed so much. I find myself yearning for the intriguing story lines and characters that a movie like The Secret of Nimh had in it. Tarzan offers the same Disney formula of new found love interest, sinister character challenges love interest, hero defeats sinister character, two unite in ever lasting bliss. Let's see other Disney cliches in action: short, rotund characters offer comic relief and tall, skinny characters are the thoughtful, strong brooding ones. Etc.Where this film truly shines, and it shines so very brightly is the animation. Disney continues to up the bar for animated movies. I've never seen so many layers of scrolling. They give the backgrounds incredible depth. The very kinetic camera work in various scenes is reminiscent of something the Coen brothers or Peter Jackson might have devised. The voice casting was very good as well. I feel Lance Henriksen was particularly well cast. This is definitely a step in the right direction, one can only hope that Disney will follow their own lead here.",Tarzan

242,Katya-12,A wonder in visuals,10,19 June 1999,"The backgrounds, and characters are some of the best yet I've seen from Disney.  People of all ages can appreciate the struggle of Tarzan.  The scenery is just amazing.",Tarzan
243,Cardone,A thrilling film achievement,10,19 June 1999,"I did not know what to expect when I went into this movie-- thank god, because any expectations would have been blown away! The animation is superb, well-blended between hand-drawn and computerized animation. The plot is also well-blended, the comic side-kick type characters don't seem added on, and aren't there too much. The villain is also intrinsic in the structure of the story. The music is great-- the opening sequence sent goosebumps down my spine with the overwhelming blend of entrenching music, convincing animation, and genuine emotion. It is a thrilling film achievement, not just for children but for everyone.",Tarzan
244,redfrog,Lots of Ooo's and AAAAA-AaAaaaa's!!,10,21 June 1999,"Tarzan is certainly an excellent film.  The animation is superb and the visual computer effects are stunning.  The soundtrack sticks in your head for a long long time.  I admit my favorite part was when Tarzan was with Jane, experiencing his own species.  The family values presented are that of loving mothers and fathers.  Kala loves Tarzan even though she knows he's not her biological son.  Prof. Porter loves Jane and helps her to let her heart decide about Tarzan.  I've seen it twice already and I want to see it again!  Definitely a MUST SEE for parents and a MUST BUY for me! =)",Tarzan

246,Tina00,Breathtaking,10,13 June 1999,"Now that Disney has learned that overly-commercial features just won't work, they're starting to get it right again. ""Tarzan"" has much the same feel as ""The Lion King,"" but is much easier to take seriously.",Tarzan
247,filmlab,Best animated feature of the last 20 years,10,2 June 1999,"I expected my enjoyment of this film to be minimal.  I come from a family of animation artists and I have abnormally high standards.  I thought Disney's ""Pocahontas"" was embarrassing.Tarzan blew me away.  It is SPLENDID! I laughed, I cried, shivers shot down my spine, I cheered, I was sorry when it ended so soon.  It is graphically contemporary and is a style unto itself.  The sound track is icing on the cake.  This is a masterpiece.The 3D background effects are enough to take your breath away. They are so good that they draw the viewer into the film.  One walks out of the theater thinking, ""Wow the real world is so flat by comparison!""  The artistic talents that created these environments have an incredible sense of the way the world is put together.Character design in general is OK, the character design of Tarzan is phenomenal.  After seeing the print ads that included the Tarzan character, I thought it might be a bit over the top.  It's not! It works wonderfully well thanks to amazingly good animation.  All the character animation showed wonderful depth and weight and feeling.This is a movie that everyone of every age can enjoy.  It's a new classic, a new standard by which animated features will be judged in the future. It's the best Tarzan film I've ever seen and certainly the best animated feature of the last 20 years.",Tarzan
248,Peanut-16,Disney's Best,10,21 June 1999,"I absolutely 1000% loved this film.  The special effects are so awesome and the digital water at the beginning is jaw-dropping. For some reason when Baby Tarzan is rolling down that net at the beginning of the film and Kala is trying to get him away from Sabor, the rolling part kind of reminded me of a Pampers or Luv diapers commercial.  I expect this film to gross over $100 million at least.  This is the second best grossing film on the opening weekend. (The first being the Lion King and the 6/24/94-6/26/94 weekend) I completely recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a new Disney Golden Age.",Tarzan
249,Hoodcoli,Best Disney in years,9,19 June 1999,This is one of the best animated Disney movies in years.  It is fun for the entire family.  The graphics and animation are great.  The story was easy to follow and made me want to reread the entire series.  I recommend this movie to everyone.,Tarzan
250,Gelatin,"Superb animation, great characterization, a submersive experience",8,5 February 2000,"Tarzan is an old and familiar story brought to new life in this wonderfully animated feature.  The characters burst into life as their personalities are well portrayed by all of the actors.  When Tarzan first meets Jane, his innocence and curiosity reflect his personality from the very beginning of the movie.  Tarzan's adopted mother Kala finds him and introduces the baby Tarzan (and the viewers) into the not only the lives of the apes, but their minds as well, which, like humans, are filled with humor, love, friendship, and decisions. Tarzan's cinematography is possibly the best, yet least gratified aspect of all.  The camera doesn't just pan before a dead, unmoving, painted background, but instead [the camera] is moved and spun around and through the trees as Tarzan (and later Jane) tree surfs and swings through the trees.  The camera is thrown around in a sudden but not a nauseating fashion in the beginning of the movie when it follows the jerky movements of a small lifeboat. The music is not just something that is heard in the background in this movie.  It doesn't plainly follow the onscreen action.  The music foreshadows an oncoming stampede of elephants, suddenly stops when the Jane tries to collect herself from being too forward, and builds suspense as Tarzan battles Sabor, a fiendish leopard. As Tarzan grows from a baby to a man, all his experiences submerse the viewer into a world brought to life by astounding animation, music that not only accompanies the action, but complements it, and characters so vivid that the viewer may believe that Tarzan's world is more than pictures imitating life, but life itself.",Tarzan
251,tealvr,Disney Wins Big Again!,10,18 June 1999,"After viewing ""Tarzan"" today with my 6 yr. old Granddaughter we have a new favorite of the Disney Movies!

This is one we will see several times and then purchase when it comes out in video!",Tarzan
252,torgo-11,Perfect!,10,19 June 1999,"This is easily the greatest Disney film, and is working its way up my own personal top 10 the more I think back on it.  It definitely follows the Disney formula, but is never hobbled by it -- in fact, the theme of the story is told more effectively here than in any of the live-action versions I've seen.  The art is absolutely brilliant, both in art direction and execution.  There are so many different styles of background art, character design, and 2D/3D and effects animation going on, and they all work together perfectly.  The whole film is just an amazing achievement, both technically and creatively.",Tarzan

254,kevlar-4,A Must See!,10,19 June 1999,"Disney have out-done themselves this time.  The artwork was incredible. The voices/actors were very ""real"".  Even though the story itself is an old one, told many times, this telling was as fresh as if it had been created yesterday!  The story kept its feet on the ground as well.  There were no references to magic, spirits, and the like.  These can make a story offensive to certain cultures, religions, etc.  It continues the legacy of fine family entertainment reaching both child and adult alike.  I will be seeing it again!",Tarzan
255,Cephus-2,"A good movie, but only half as good as it could've been.",8,22 June 1999,"Disney's new animated feature, ""Tarzan"" has made it into theaters and moviegoers will certainly leave satisfied. Mainly because the previous years fare has been rather disappointing; Disney made a comeback with 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"", and hit their peak with 1994's ""The Lion King"", and they've been heading pretty much downhill ever since. After slowing their plunge with last year's ""Mulan"", it seems ""Tarzan"" is their attempt to begin climbing back to the top.The film carries so many good things, you may fail to notice its faults; while the Ape-man swings, surfs, and flips his way through the jungle, he may pull the loincloth over your eyes to hide the homegrown Disney formula.On one hand, the film sports a Title Character you can really get behind, drawn by champion animator Glen Keane(Ariel, Beast, Aladdin, and Pocahontas), and voiced by Tony Goldwyn. His leading lady is just as good (if not better), the quirky, Jane-brought to life by Ken Duncan and Minnie Driver-is top notch, leaving the sassy, and independent spirit of most modern Disney heroines behind, and giving us the even better treat of just being herself. The animators have outdone themselves in the action department, whether its dealing with Sabor-the local leopard-or running from wild baboons, this films actions scenes soar high above those of its live action counterparts. The backgrounds give the film a lush beautiful look all its own, blowing all of the other animated jungle pictures far away. The deep canvas effect that allows you to surf along with Tarzan, is probably one of the things you'll remember most, along with the strength of the story, the strong bond between Tarzan and his ape-mother, Kala, and the opposition of Kerchak, Tarzan's adoptive ape-father. Disney, slowly weening themselves off of the broadway teat, has Phil Collins, not Tarzan, belt out the tunes, with narrative and very effective musical numbers that give the movie a lot of its heart(something, they should've tried with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"").So, this movie seems to have everything, great leads, thrills and chills, amazing art, strong relationships, and a deviation from typical Disney expectations--not so fast, like many Disney films, ""Tarzan"" is a healthy balance of a lot of things, including the good and the bad. The remainder of the film's cast is pretty lame, Tarzan's goofy sidekicks, Tantor, the neurotic elephant and Terk, the loudmouth Brooklyn ape are incredibly extraneous, its seems they wait around for the entire film just to perform one or two tasks along the way. Jane's father, Prof. Archimedes Q. Porter serves no real purpose either, but to be the typical tiny, dawdering, absent minded Disney dad. Even worse is the villain, the gun-toting Clayton, who is entirely one dimensional, if the studio wanted a real challenge for writing this film, they would've eliminated him from the plot. Disney animated films usually can't function without a serious antagonist, but this story has SO MUCH potential it really could have; the conflicts between Tarzan, Sabor, and Kerchak, are probably enough for an original, ambitious script. The action scenes are new and exciting until the third act, when it becomes the usual Disney fare, where a bunch of bad guys attack a bunch of good guys, and everybody gets a curtain call to join in and add some hilarity to the action. The technological breakthough of 'deep canvas' would be even better taken a bit further, applying a lush shadowy look to the characters as well, making them fully blend in with their beautiful environment. And if it weren't for Rosie O'Donnell's quasi-musical number, every sequence of the film would be bearable, instead of sticking with the rest of the characters, Terk has to go out on her own and perform her own personal rendition of 'stomp', being the only real story element to date the film.Disney's ""Tarzan"" is definitely one of their best films since ""The Lion King""(which coincidentally also has a weak third act), mixing the discoveries from ""Pocahontas"" and ""Hunchback"", leaving the ""Hercules"" stuff behind, and throwing in the maturity of ""Mulan"", they've created themselves a good picture that will do well against all of their new animated competitors. But, like ""Mulan"", ""Tarzan"" is just another film that works well with their formula, which gives it the appearance of a brand spanking new concept. Features like ""The Little Mermaid"" ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Aladdin"" all hit the mark all the way around; with strong characters(including an over-the-top villain), great stories(with new twists), and beautiful settings shown through the magic of the creative mind,  ""Tarzan"" can't promise you all of these things, but its a wonderful start at trying to get there again.",Tarzan
256,TheGrape,The Most Amazing Animated Film,10,21 June 1999,"Oh, shut up. Say what you will about Disney and its animated features, but this one is really one to watch.Cross the best elements of Lion King, Hunchback, with hints and sniffs of Pocahontas, Beauty and the Beast and Hercules, and you get this amazing film.  Sure, you might feel like you watched a part of the movie from elsewhere, but the movie as a whole works so well that you quickly forgets about it and are completely emersed into the story.In fact, Tarzan is worth the ticket just for the animation along. Seeing Tarzan swing and surfing around in the jungle is very, very satisfying and surprisingly exciting, not to mention the fact that it's just so damn cool. Most of the jungle is modeled in full 3D with the ""Deep Canvas"" technology, and the result is an exhilarating ride. In fact, I went ahead and saw Episode 1 in the same day, and came out totally unimpressed by its visuals. The pod race, for example, does not have the same sense of tense excitement and speed as the battle with Jaguar or the monkeys scene in Tarzan. With the best animation I've seen ever, Disney proves once and for all that Tarzan is a story best told in animation, because it is simply impossible to achieve the same effect in the real world.Fortunately, it is much more than pretty visuals. Its opening scene is one of the most powerful and ingenious that I've seen in ages. And it's also a lot more exciting that most other action films out there, real actors or otherwise. The tense and exciting scenes must be seen to be believed, the jaguar (maybe it wasn't a jaguar... I forget what it's called) fight and the mad chase scenes in particular.I know I'm using way too many ""exciting"" here, but that's really what it is, a wild ride from the beginning to the end. And the best part is, this movie seems to have two plotlines -- one for the kids, one for the adults. And, as a teenager, I can laugh with the kids and also plunge into deep thoughts with the adults about one's true identity.Overall, this is the best animated feature I've seen in years. If you don't like animated films, you should still at least watch this one. Amazing, amazing film.",Tarzan

A beautifully written, although not terribly accurate as it is a Disney movie, though beautifully woven together. The animation is top notch, unifying traditional animation with seamless 3D effects and environments. With this, Disney is able to take you where they want allowing for you and your kid to experience animation at its finest. There attention to the smallest of details is truly amazing.The story is an adequate mixture of humor, drama, and action. The cast is hilarious, with the exception of casting Rosie O' Donell as Puck, Tarzan's best friend. It seems more that Rosie is playing herself, rather than the character. Though a minor point at that.The orchestrated music is wonderful, and the song tracks composed by Phil Collins, match the settings quite well. A great movie.",Tarzan
259,laurabarton1,Tarzan is the 2nd best Disney film ever!!,10,19 December 2006,"The very best Disney film ever is ""The Lion King"", but Tarzan is the 2nd best. Disney films nowadays are all the same, either about father and son, teenage freaks, that can't even sing or a comedy with rubbish jokes.Tarzan is a fantastic film containing none of these things.It is about a boy being raised by gorilla's in a beautiful, yet deadly jungle. This film contains good jokes,tearful scenes, and has that Disney spark that makes it not just good for kids, but great for adults as well. I think everyone knows what i mean when i say ""i am fed up with modern Disney films that may look good, like the movie ""Cars"", but doesn't have any message like loyalty or trust. They are usually about friendship, which is OK, but is in every single modern day Disney film. Tarzan contains many messages that will leave you thinking about it afterwards.",Tarzan
260,preheatedsum,Disney at its so very best,10,28 September 2020,"I was a very young kid, when this movie came out. Most people have movies, that they have grown up with, watched over and over, and this is one of mine. Every time i return to watch it, it touches me. I don't know, might just be nostalgia - but i still feel that this movie, with its ability to make toddlers as well as grown ups feel so deeply for it, is the manifestation of what Disney is, or was, to some of us.. It will never not be one of my favourites!",Tarzan

His songs completely brought everything to life.Such a shame it was probably Disneys last good film, animation wise. Amazing!",Tarzan
262,Jaguar14,One of the greatest movies in my childhood!,10,21 November 2008,"I was 6 years old when I first saw this and loved it with all my heart. Now, a decade later, that feeling still hasn't changed. It looks gorgeous and all the characters were fleshed out and voiced perfectly (I loved Wayne Knight's performance of the cowardly Tantor). Phil Collins' music was just beautiful (My favorite would have to be You'll be in my Heart and Son of Man). I did find the ending a little too dark for kids, and I cried when I saw Kerchak die and it still brings a tear in my eye today. Overall, if you have a chance to go watch this movie, DO IT. It's great in every single aspect you can think and you'll not be disappointed at all.",Tarzan
263,eveetoombs,Wow...one of Disney's best!,8,16 July 2010,"I first saw this film when I was 6 in the cinema. Whilst I remembered parts, like Tarzan and Jane pressing their hands together and the scene at the beginning with the burning ship, I could not appreciate the film for what it is. I also remember being quite scared too, so i' be reluctant to let an under 5 watch it. Over a decade later, older and wiser (slightly!), I can see the film for what it really is...damn good! I adored a lot, and what ""Tarzan"" does well, it does very, very well. The animation is nothing less than wonderful-you wouldn't think this was made in 1999 because it's fresh even now. The music, well, i've never been a Phil Collins or a Genesis fan, obviously because it's well before my time and my folks weren't fans either, but I love the music. The heartfelt ""You'll Be In My Heart"", the energetic ""Son of Man"", and the fun ""Trashin' The Camp"" are great. The voice cast is also great-Minnie Driver gets particular praise as Jane. The characters are great too-I, for one, actually liked Terk as a child! And then there's the story. Disney has a talent for taking classical stories and turning them into family films, and ""Tarzan"" is not an exception. It's a very fun adaptation, and true in terms of characterisation. My only issues are some of the characters-what is the point of Professer Porter? He brings nothing to the story-and the end, which is disappointingly weak. But I can look past that. Overall, ""Tarzan"" is a very good film, and a great effort from Disney. It's a shame it turned a bit stale after this one (apart from Pixar's work, which are mostly fab), although some have been pretty good, like ""Emperors New Groove"" and-dare I say-""Treasure Planet"". Give this a look, you might really like it =)",Tarzan
264,nanna81,Sooo horrible..,1,6 May 2005,"After watching Disney's 'The Lion King' (which I loved), I had lots of great expectations of this new, supposedly great, Disney movie. But it turned out to be a great disappointment instead - and when the movie ended, I have to admit, I was quite relieved as well as left wondering how Disney could bring themselves to show this movie to the public. It seemed so unfinished.. First of all, the only people Tarzan encounters in the jungle are Jane & co, who all speak with a British accent. And still, Tarzan (when learning almost perfect English in a few days!?) speaks with a thick American accent. Where did that come from? This leads me to the next thing, I have been wondering - how does he know that his name is pronounced 'Tarr-zaan' in English? I mean, the name was given to him by his monkey-mother, so he has probably never heard it pronounced any other way than 'uh uh huh' or something.. I find that very weird. Second, is the bruising I would imagine he'd get on his feet, from surfing like crazy around in the trees. Again - very strange.. Third is the villain. I never quite understood what his motives are, and I've just concluded that he must be just plain mean and cruel for no apparent reason. Well, I could keep naming this movie's inconsistencies but that would take up too much space, I think. Finally, don't get me wrong. I do have an imagination and I am aware that Disney movies don't always reflect reality. After all, I liked 'The Lion King', where all the animals talk and stuff, but in 'Tarzan' it is just not convincing, because the whole story is so stupid and non-believable.",Tarzan
265,ksmoaky,Tarzan has the best soundtrack of any Disney movie,10,30 September 2014,"Tarzan, gives a behind the scenes look at a family of gorillas who adopt a young human boy and raise him as one of them. The film is accompanied by the soundtrack combining the talents of Phil Collins and Mark Mancina. Each of the fourteen songs in the movie build the intensity of the moment. This movie is great because even though something tragic happened to the main character he grows up loved by animals he looks nothing like. Kala's songs and words prove that she deeply loves Tarzan and will protect him from any harm. Other than the emotional moments, the soundtrack benefits the fight scenes. Beginning with Sabor attacking Tarzan's birth parents, to Sabor attack Kerchak and Tarzan, and finally Tarzan and the other gorillas defending their home from Clayton. Collins and Mancina do a marvelous job of keeping the attention and emotions of these two kinds of scenes. The soundtrack to Tarzan is the best soundtrack Disney has ever made.Love in the gorilla family is expresses with facial expressions and songs. Kala sings a song to Tarzan on his first night in the jungle to stop him from crying. She says ""I will protect you from all around you. I will be here don't you cry"" (Collins). She establishes her motherly position over Tarzan from the night she brings him to the nest to the day she tells him he will always be her son. Even though clearly upset, and Mancina's soft background melodies infer this, Kala knows her son will be better off living with his own species. Love is even shown in between the young gorillas and Tantor in the ""Trashin' the Camp"" song. This song, even though it is destructive in the camp, shows how the bonds in the family are very strong. Turk, voiced by Rosie O'Donnell, shows her leadership skills as she orchestrates the hilarious tune. She becomes very emotional when Tarzan leaves too quickly for her and Tantor to say goodbye. Anytime there were sad moments in the film, Mancina produced soft melodies to bring tears to any listener's eyes.Each of the fight scenes in Tarzan are intensely accompanied by a suspenseful tune from Mancina. In the opening scene when Tarzan's parent's boat crashed, they rowed safety to shore to find a place to build a home. Upon finishing their tree house, Sabor found them and left Tarzan abandoned in the rubble of his new home. The ambush scene made viewers jump with switches in the melodies with each teeth snap and claw swipe. The next major fight was between Kerchak and Tarzan against Sabor. Sabor injures Kerchak and Tarzan must save the leader who never really approved of him being in their family. He loses his spear head and has to dodge the massive claws of Sabor as they bust through tree roots and vines. The music behind this scene intensifies with each close encounter Tarzan has with death by Sabor. Tarzan does manage to retrieve his knife and when he stabs Sabor to death, the music soothes. The final fight scene Mancina scores is dark and frightening. This mood is set because the nest was attacked at night and the gorillas did not know what was happening. Clayton set fire to the nest and began trying to trap all of the gorillas to bring them back to England for money. When each fight comes to an end, Mancina and Collins calm the mood to relieve the viewer's knowing that Tarzan won and will be okay. Tarzan establishes his dominance after each of the fight scenes leading up to becoming the rightful leader of the family in the end. He manages to live through Sabor's original attack, when Sabor comes back again, Tarzan kills him, and when Clayton's men destroy their nesting grounds with fire, he traps them in cages and rescues his gorilla family.",Tarzan
266,hannahdenny-53454,Tarzan,10,14 October 2015,"Tarzan starts off with a very little boy and his mother and father getting in a shipwreck. Then it skips to where they are building their new home in the jungle. Tarzan parents later die from a jaguar attack and he gets taken in by a mother gorilla that had just lost her child to that same jaguar. From the start, the leader of their group doesn't like Tarzan because he is different from the rest of them and because he is a human. Tarzan then decides to prove himself and in the act he kills the jaguar that has been harassing his group and that had killed his family. After that Tarzan finds Jane, a caring, young, British girl. Jane and her father are gorilla experts, but they are tainted by an evil doing and money hoarding man. They do not realize that he's bad until it's too late. Tarzan is a fantastic children's movie. It has a great message, including always be yourself and to be the best you, you can be. It was pretty good. If I were a little kid, it would be my favorite movie. I think Tarzan teaches children good lessons and good morals.",Tarzan

The story is great and the characters were really fun to watch. I love the music. Great action. Funny story. I am in second grade so I see a lot of animated movies - this one was great. I hope Tarzan marries Jane. Is Tarzan real? Can Tarzan swim? Are there really those kind of monkeys? Is that island real in the Tarzan movie? I am getting tired of this. They make you write too much to get it put on the web site. I am only 7 years old - this is hard to do. Can I Be Done Now? It is my bed time and I need to go to school tomorrow!!,Tarzan
268,dyewagner1728,Wicked Awesome!,10,25 January 2007,"This is one of the greatest movies Disney has ever made. The idea of a gorilla who lost her own baby adopting a human baby who lost his parents was perfect. In the beginning Kerchack, Kala and their son seemed so much like Tarzan and his family. Seeing the baby gorilla get killed was way too sad! I almost started to cry. Terk and Tantor are good too, mostly when they're younger though, but Terk's death threats are hilarious. And Jane, her father, and Clayton- Jane was very sweet and shy, but a bit clumsy, and that's what I like about her. Her father was funny with his teasing- ""Shall I leave you and the blackboard alone for a moment?"" and Clayton was a jerk, pure a simple. Songs- beautiful, especially Two Worlds and You'll Be in My Heart. Romance- The kiss at the end was perfect, not over the top. And Terk's whole, ""Go ahead we won't stop you"" smirk was so funny. How can you not notice a 2 ton elephant and a bunch of (like) 80lb gorillas walking onto the beach? Anyways this is one of my favorite movies!",Tarzan

Considering the Sabor was jammed in the pulley system. Which I doubt the was able to get down. And there's more then 1 cheetah in existence.",Tarzan
