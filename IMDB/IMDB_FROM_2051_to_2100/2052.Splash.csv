0,TheLittleSongbird,One of the most charming and irresistible romantic comedies ever!,10,17 November 2009,"I will admit there have been some romantic comedies I have not liked, and others I have. One thing for certain though, I adore Splash! It is a beautiful, charming and sweet romantic comedy that has quickly become a favourite of mine. For instance the whole film is beautifully shot, with lovely cinematography and stunning underwater sequences. Plus New York looks absolutely gorgeous here.The music is also delightful. The song in the end credits was so beautiful, I nearly cried. Maybe it was also to do with how it is sung; the vocals were sublime, and never spoiled the mood of the song. The script is funny and touching, more the latter than the former, but who cares? There are still some funny parts of the movie. The direction from Ron Howard was secure and focused throughout.There were so many charming scenes in Splash! The ending certainly was exactly that, and a bit of a tear jerker as well. Another charming scene that springs to mind was the ice skating scene. Not only how it was filmed, but also the music featured. A perfect choice of music for that particular scene, the Skaters Waltz. I also thought that the movie's length was perfect, and the pacing was just fine.And I can't write this review without mentioning the performances. Every single person did a superb job. Tom Hanks is charismatic and likable enough and was perfectly cast as Allan Bauer, a successful businessman who falls in love with a beautiful mermaid named Maddison. Speaking of Maddison, didn't Daryl Hannah look gorgeous here? She is a generally ignored actress, and she was positively charming. Eugene Levy plays a sort of bad guy, and he is funny as well as detestable. However, the film's humour comes from the late John Candy who is hilarious as Allan's brother.All in all, I adore this movie. Out of all the romantic comedies I have seen, this has to be the most charming and possibly irresistible. I have been vocal before about not trying to take IMDb ratings to heart, but 6.2 is too low for this movie. It does deserve a higher rating than that. While not the best movie ever made, it is certainly one of my all time favourite movies for a number of reasons. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Splash
1,SnoopyStyle,lovely fun rom-com,8,2 December 2014,"20 years ago in Cape Cod, Allen Bauer jumps off a boat, meets a young mermaid and is rescued. Now in NYC, Allen (Tom Hanks) and his no-good brother Freddie (John Candy) are owners of their late father's fruit wholesale business. Allen's girlfriend dumps him and he runs off to Cape Cod. Eccentric paranoid scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy) is looking for mermaids. Allen is injured after falling off another boat and a mysterious naked girl (Daryl Hannah) rescues him. She picks up his wallet and follows him to NYC. The cops find her at the Statue of Liberty with Allen's wallet and reunites them. She takes on the name Madison after the street sign.Everybody is so lovable in this movie. Even a pervert John Candy is loads of fun. It's a joyful movie. Daryl Hannah is a beautiful fish out of water. I love the lobster. The pairing of Hanks and Candy is great. They would reunite one more time in the less successful 'Volunteers'. This is a fairly simple rom-com with Eugene Levy providing the obstacle. Director Ron Howard shows that he has a soft conventional touch.",Splash
2,gavin6942,"I Prefer The Little Mermaid, But This was Alright",6,2 October 2007,"As a boy, Allen Bauer jumped off a cruise ship and came face to face with a real mermaid. Many years later, after a nasty break-up, he finds another one, but doesn't realize what she is because -- magically -- she can have legs when on dry land. Can love cross the boundaries of the sea and what about the scientists who want to dissect her and trap her in a tuna net?I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, Eugene Levy is a dork and John Candy is just not particularly funny, in my opinion. Granted, Candy has had a few good roles (""Uncle Buck"", ""Home Alone"") but overall is just a loud-mouthed nuisance. Levy has only become a bigger star over time, which is really too bad... he was fine here. Hanks, well, I liked ""The Terminal"" and a few others, but he is very hit and miss for me (which may be his choice of romantic comedies).Daryl Hannah played the role of the mermaid Madison. I have to get this off my chest: if, as is claimed, girls today are named Madison because of this film, this film owes the world an apology. But second, why Daryl Hannah? She's somewhat manlike, and they have her (a vegetarian) eating lobster? And how does your hair stay crimped underwater? I don't have a better casting suggestion, but I didn't find her convincing as a strong love interest. The silent acting was done alright, however.Here's the spoiler part: at the end, Bauer has the choice to join Madison in the sea or to stay on land without her. The catch is that under the sea, he must be by her at all times or he will drown, and he can never return to land. He chooses the sea. I'm sorry, but he proposes to a girl after about four days of knowing her and then gives up his friends and family and a well-paying job to go to the ocean? Where he has to pee and poop in front of a mermaid all the time, and he cannot talk? I have friends I love and have had some close relationships with girls, but together forever, always and everywhere? I don't know.I never saw ""Mermaids"" but I have seen ""The Little Mermaid"" multiple times. I like that one far better than this. Good songs, good epic story (with the same amount of romance) and a far more beautiful mermaid. Ariel can kick Madison's butt any day of the week. But if you like Tom Hanks and early 1980s films... this one was enjoyable.",Splash
3,lee_eisenberg,Any more mermaids out there?,10,18 April 2006,"True, ""Splash"" is pretty silly, but it's impossible not to like. The plot of course has unfulfilled clerk Allen Bauer (Tom Hanks) meeting up with a mermaid (Daryl Hannah) who turns his life upside down. Much of the movie's humor derives from Allen's brother Freddie's (John Candy) goof-ball antics - namely when he drops coins and later speaks Swedish - and nerdy scientist Walter Kornbluth's (Eugene Levy) chronic bad luck. Another great scene is when the mermaid identifies her sea name before choosing Madison.All in all, this affirms Ron Howard as a director who always has some ideas. This movie really does make a splash!",Splash
4,jboothmillard,Splash,9,21 September 2005,"From director Ron Howard (The Grinch, A Beautiful Mind) this has always been repeated and is still a much loved romantic fantasy comedy. The film begins with young Allen Bauer falling into the water as a child, and there for a few moments meeting a mermaid who rescued him. Years later, grown up, Allen (then unknown Tom Hanks in a rising star role) works in a fruit and vegetable shipping place in New York, along with his cheeky brother Freddie (a lovable John Candy). After a visit to Cape Cod Allen manages to have another sea accident, and is again saved by the same mermaid, also grown up (the beautiful Daryl Hannah). Later, she searches for Allen, sprouting legs (she has fins in the water), and after a little while they fall in love, and she learns to talk from television. She does not tell Allen her secret though, and eventually (after recognising her in the ocean, and again in the newspaper - when she was found naked at the Statue of Liberty) mermaid believer Walter Kornbluth (American Pie's Eugene Levy) is determined to prove that she is a mermaid by soaking her. When he proves it, she is put in a marine research laboratory, and Allen is shattered, but there is a happy ending when he and Walter (after a change of heart) whisk her back to the ocean, and Allen swims with her to her palace. A lovely story with a lovely couple, and great gags, particularly from Candy, and Hanks when he shouts ""she left me"" (because everyone keeps asking where his wife is) at a wedding. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Splash
5,Woodyanders,Very cute and enjoyable romantic fantasy comedy,8,19 February 2020,"Workaholic bachelor Allen Bauer (a fine and likeable performance by Tom Hanks) meets and falls in love with fetching and innocent young lass Madison (Daryl Hannah at her most radiant and appealing). However, Allen is unaware that Madison is really a mermaid who grows a tail whenever her legs get wet.Director Ron Howard brings just the right sweet'n'warm tone to the pleasant and engrossing premise. Hanks and Hannah make for a very nice and charming couple. Moreover, the rest of the cast are likewise smack dab on the money: John Candy almost steals the whole show with his wonderfully raucous turn as Allen's loud and lecherous brother Freddie, Eugene Levy excels as nerdy obsessed marine biologist Walter Kornbluth, Dody Goodman is a total hoot as ditsy secretary Mrs. Stimler, and Richard B. Schull does his usual solid work as the coldly pragmatic Dr. Ross. In addition, this film serves as a neat time capsule of 1980's New York City. Kudos are also in order for Lee Holdridge's sprightly score and Donald Peterman's vibrant cinematography. An absolute delight.",Splash
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Young, But Not-So-Innocent",7,31 May 2007,"In 1999, I was somewhat shocked to discover this was not the sweet, innocent movie I had remembered from watching it on the big screen 15 years earlier. There was a lot more profanity than I had recalled and tons of sexual innuendos. I was sorry to hear John Candy, who I always liked, use the Lord's name in vain so much.On the good side, the film still moves very fast, meaning the story is very entertaining. It's another shock to look at this now and see how young Tom Hanks looks. Darryl Hannah, meanwhile, looks just beautiful. I'll think she'll always be remembered as a mermaid (among other things, since she apparently still likes to see herself in the news from time to time.)",Splash
7,rmax304823,Sic Transit Gloria Maris.,6,2 March 2012,"This amusing fantasy about a love affair between an ordinary working New Yorker (Hanks) and a mermaid (Hannah) could have been made a generation ago by Walt Disney except for one marvelous -- and, in my opinion, highly artistic -- scene in which Daryl Hannah emerges from New York harbor wearing a pair of supernally beautiful legs and nothing else. Her naked buns, paragons of sensual grace in themselves, would probably have made old Walt think twice, although any normal man would want to jump on her and squeeze and bite them.Hanks has met her by accident, literally, and she's everything a guy like Hanks could want. She seeks him out in New York, moves in with him, learns to speak and dress properly, loves him deeply (as only a mermaid can love deeply), and is a sexual dynamo. There is no anatomical difficulty with this since when she's out of the water, Hannah has those legs. It's only IN water, or splashed by it, that her piscatorial particulars reappear. Eugene Levy, as an ill-tempered and egomaniacal ichthyologist, feels there's something fishy about this stunning catch of the day. The movie is funny but Levy brings it to a loopy climax that the kids will love. The ending, though wistful, is basically a happy one. They have both learned what true love is. They have ""gotten in touch with their feelings."" (I love that phrase.) Ron Howard, the director, would never dream of having the audience leaving the theater without a glow.Since it's intended to be a fantasy, we can skip the illogic of the plot. Well, not ""illogic."" Just an absence of logic. She learns to speak English in one afternoon just by watching television. Well, why not? Peter Sellars learned how to live by watching television a few years earlier. Still, one wonders where she learned to kiss so hungrily, fresh from the sea.At any rate, most of the humor is of the ""cute"" variety rather than sophisticated and edgy. This is Ron Howard, not Billy Wilder. Hanks asks her name. She tells him in Ichthyese and it shatters every television screen in sight. So they stroll through the streets of the city and try to dream up a plausible English name for her. They reach Madison Avenue. ""Madison!"" Well, again, why not? Some of the scenes are worthy of chuckles as well as smiles. Taken to a fancy restaurant, she gets a lobster for dinner and eats the whole thing, shell and all, in an incident similar to one in Eugene O'Neill's ""Ah, Wilderness."" To truly enjoy this film requires an imagination more deft than the usual at the suspension of disbelief. You should be really good at it.",Splash
8,Tweekums,A Mermaid in New York,7,28 March 2017,"When New Yorker Allen Bauer was eight years old he jumped off a boat near Cape Cod and met a young mermaid; twenty years later he believes he must have imagined it. Then one day he returns to Cape Cod and falls into the water; he wakes on a beach having been rescued by the mermaid although by the time he sees her she has legs; we later learn she only has her tail when she is wet. She then disappears into the sea and he returns home. She finds the wallet he dropped then follows him back to New York. Here she is arrested while walking around naked by the Statue of Liberty; the police contact Allen and he takes her home. She quickly learns to speak English, from watching TV, soon after she takes the name Madison, after the Avenue. The two of them start to enjoy their time together she tells him that she can only stay a few days and that she has a secret obviously he has no idea what it is as he rapidly falls in love with her. Meanwhile scientist Walter Kornbluth is determined to find Madison and prove what she really is.This is a fun romantic comedy with a fairly obvious twist namely the fact that Madison is a mermaid. The romantic plot is pleasant enough and there are plenty of laughs throughout the film as well as a degree of tension when her secret is exposed. Tom Hanks does a fine job as Allen Bauer and Daryl Hannah is great as Madison; making her unbelievable character believable. They are ably supported by John Candy who manages to walk the fine line between being hilarious and being annoying as Allen's brother Freddie and Eugene Levy who also provides plenty of laughs as Kornbluth; especially when his character keeps getting beaten up for soaking the wrong woman. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for an utterly charming film with almost nothing to offend.",Splash
9,moonspinner55,"Cheap, vulgar comedy",5,7 June 2001,"Unlucky-in-love Tom Hanks falls for a beautiful blonde with a secret...she's a mermaid. Hanks is very young and very green in this movie, his voice has no range and he's whiny instead of appealing (and the jokes he's given, such as having ""sex on top of the refrigerator"", don't work because who wants to picture Hanks in such a situation?). Tom's transformation into a heel at the midway point is another liability (he's so cold to Daryl Hannah's mermaid that it's tough to forgive him even at the end). Witless antics with third-rate humor, leering overtures by John Candy as Hanks' slob brother, leaden pacing and ugly photography. The only saving grace is Hannah, who is enchanting in a role she was born to play. Too bad she's not in a better picture. ** from ****",Splash

Hannah has her mermaid tail while in the water; but, she grows long, beautiful legs on land.Hananh finds Hanks' wallet and goes looking for him in New York City, where she acts like a fish out of water. SCTV funny-men Eugene Levy (as Walter) and John Candy (s Freddie) try to choke some laughs out of their roles, but the comedy herein is dead in the water.

11,sunwarrior13,Dated But Fun To Watch,8,28 December 2011,"""I'm in love with a mermaid!"" And with the delightful Darryl Hannah in the lead, who could fault anyone with me saying that? Splash is a fantasy romantic comedy film directed by Ron Howard, written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, and starring Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, John Candy, Eugene Levy, and Dody Goodman. The story begins in 1959, when a young boy is rescued from a watery grave by an adolescent mermaid. Twenty-five years later, the boy has grown up and he is Allen Bauer. Meanwhile, the mermaid, likewise grown up, has surfaced in search of Hanks, her long-lost love. On dry land, the mermaid is able to walk about on legs; any contact with salt water, and she reverts to her half-fish form. Adopting the name of Madison from a New York street sign, the girl manages to win the young man's heart. Alas, a secret government lab, populated by such smarmy types captures Madison for research purposes--and possible vivisection. Egged on by his brother,Allen Bauer rescues his beloved, joining her in the ocean.Together they swim along the ocean floor toward what appears to be an underwater kingdom.Splash is a light-hearted comedy that sparkles here and there thanks to its fairy tale elements.The gorgeous Daryl Hannah does wonders with her thankless job, flitting tiny moments of joy and confusion across her face.The charming performances from Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah makes this film a perfectly light, warmly funny film to watch. It maybe dated for present viewers but it is still a delight to watch.",Splash

13,preppy-3,Just OK,5,6 February 2004,"A mermaid (Daryl Hannah) falls in love with a man (Tom Hanks).  According to this movie, when a mermaid's tail completely dries it turns into legs.  So, she tracks him down on land.  They both immediately fall in love...but he has no idea that she's a mermaid.  And a bumbling, evil scientist (Eugene Levy) knows she is and will do anything to prove it...This was a HUGE hit in 1984--but I fail to see why.  It has it's good points--it's beautifully directed by Ron Howard (the underwater sequences are magical). Dody Goodman throws in some truly funny moments as Hanks' scatterbrained secretary. Hannah is unbelievably beautiful and letter perfect as the mermaid--when she's stumbling around nude on dry land (mermaids don't wear clothes) her utter innocence is totally believable and very engaging. It's refreshing that this was given a PG rating despite the frequent glimpses of Hannahs' breasts. Also her getting used to life on land is very sweet.  And Hanks (looking like a little kid) is very good and has a few laugh out loud lines in the movie.  But that's about it.I found the movie very slow (this does NOT need to go on for 2 hours); Levy was horribly unfunny as the scientist; John Candy (who could be good in the right role) is also unfunny as Hanks' brother; there are plot loopholes you could drive a truck through; I really didn't find it all that funny (I think I laughed 5 times--that's not good for a 2 hour movie); we have the boringly predictable military as the enemy role and there's an ending I just couldn't buy at all.The only scenes that really work are with Hannah and Hanks.  They have zero chemistry between them but they're both very good in their respective roles. And there are some nice directorial touches by Howard (it's hard to believe this was only his third film).I can only give this a 5.  I was bored most of the time.",Splash
14,view_and_review,So Many Anatomical Questions,6,14 March 2020,"This movie left me with questions that I really want answered. All of them stem from: how is their relationship going to work?When Allen (Tom Hanks) met Madison (Daryl Hannah) he fell in love with her in a matter of days. I know that largely had to do with the fact that she gave him an appetizer and then gave him the full course in a matter of a day. She greeted him with a lip lock so fierce it was like she was trying to suck the fillings out of his teeth. You combine beauty with nudity and sex and just about any man was going to fall in love with her no questions asked.When Allen found out that Madison was a mermaid that gave him pause. But by this time he'd already been intimate with her. At no time before he dove headlong into having sex with her multiple times did he even stop to ask one question. He did not even know her name, where she came from, what she wanted, if she had COVID-19, nothing. Yet, he willingly slept with her and was only perturbed when he found out that she was part fish. I guess that would give any man reason to be hesitant, but he could've also practice that same cautiousness before that point and gotten to know her then made a more informed decision about whether or not he would sleep with a human koi fish.But this is a love story and they fell in love, so once it was time for her to return to the sea he had a big decision to make: does he stay home in New York City living a normal human life sans his newfound love, or does he throw caution to the wind and jump into the ocean to live out the rest of his days underwater? To some of you this may be an easy answer. Some of you would say it's a no brainer that you have to follow your heart. Others of you, me being amongst them, would say it's a no brainer I'm a human being and I'm gonna live out the rest of my life as a human. And at the risk of sounding cliche, there are other fish in the sea.Allen, followed his heart. To what end did he follow his heart? We will never know because the movie ended. The romantic part of us, if we have such a part, wants to believe that he lived the rest of his life happily ever after underwater. The logical part of us would strongly believe that shortly after his escapade underwater with Madison he realized this is not very feasible let me get back home.But let us assume that romance and the heart dominated the decision making. Now, he has to know that the moment she changed back to a mermaid she no longer had a vagina. I know he loved her but, her vagina is a big reason he fell in love with her. How was he expecting to enjoy her goodies or have children? Was he going to be satisfied with her laying eggs and him fertilizing them? Or do they find a remote island where she can change back to a human for him to enjoy her and possibly even impregnate her? And then that raises a whole batch of other questions about family, the kids' species, and ocean life versus land life etc. etc.I know the point of this movie wasn't for us to think about anatomy and the viability of this beautiful relationship. It's a love story, I get it, and we are not supposed really think much about it. The point of it is that love transcends all obstacles and that has been told in various forms: alien and human, animal and human, mermaid and human, black and white, and whatever and whatever--love knows no bounds. It sounds wonderful but it does not eliminate my questions.",Splash
15,evanston_dad,Is That Daryl Hannah in Your Bathtub?,7,17 March 2008,"Before both Ron Howard and Tom Hanks became known for making gooey message movies, they teamed up on this very likable comedy.Hanks plays a man searching for love and finds it in the form of Daryl Hannah. Unfortunately, his dream woman has the habit of growing a tail and gills whenever she gets wet, though in Hanks's world, this isn't necessarily a deal breaker. Eugene Levy is a scientist who wants to capture the mermaid for his own fame, and John Candy is Hanks's loud-mouth brother.Full of memorable scenes, like Hannah scarfing down a lobster, shell and all, at a posh restaurant.

Shull: Bizarre romantic comedy about events that impact our lives. Tom Hanks plays Allen Bauer who runs a fruit stand with his brother Freddie, played by John Candy. When Allen was a boy he nearly drown but was saved by what he believes was a mermaid. Central plot regards a reconnection with this mermaid when a boating accident ends up with him on shore with a head injury. She takes the name Madison and conceals her identity because she can only form her tail when she is wet. Eugene Levy plays Walter Kornbluth who attempts to expose Madison as a mermaid. His attempts have aggressive yet amusing consequences. Ron Howard elevates beyond his previous directing efforts Grand Theft Auto and Night Shift by creating a genuine sense of romance and acceptance. While the ending draws questions Howard proves capable of bigger challenges. Daryl Hannah brings a stunning innocence as Madison who learns fast but struggles to maintain a concealed identity until it becomes public. Tom Hanks as Allen brings confidence yet bewilderment at this strange beautiful woman. John Candy as Freddie is perverse yet loyal in assisting his brother. Levy brings the pratfalls as Walter who has a change of heart. Other roles are typical but the theme of love and connection make the biggest splash. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Splash
18,AaronCapenBanner,A Mermaid,6,8 December 2013,"Ron Howard directed this hit comedy that stars Tom Hanks as harried businessman Allen Bauer, who as a young boy almost drowned off Cape Cod, but a young mermaid saved his life, and many years later as adults, when the same thing happens again, the mermaid(played by Daryl Hannah) follows Allen home to New York, where she comes ashore nude, making quite an entrance! After Allen takes her home, and names her Madison, they fall in love, which is tested when her secret comes out, and unscrupulous scientists(led by Eugene Levy) want to study her, which will mean her eventual death. John Candy costars as his brother Freddie. Appealing comedy nearly goes off the rails with the kidnapping subplot, but manages to right itself by the end. Good cast helps.",Splash
19,Aaron1375,Nice cast and a funny romantic story.,7,3 March 2010,"This was an early film in the career of Tom Hanks, one of his first successful movies. He would go on to be somewhat hit and somewhat miss throughout the 1980's and become more of a guaranteed hit maker in the 1990's and 2000's. Here he stars alongside a very attractive Daryl Hannah in a nice little romantic comedy that at one point gets rather risqué for a PG rated movie during a certain emerging at the Statue of Liberty scene. The film also features SCTV alum John Candy and Eugene Levy both of whom are hilarious in this one. Candy as Hanks' slightly sex obsessed brother and Levy as a researcher who is a bit of a jerk. The story involves Hanks' character who has an accident as a child and falls into the ocean only to encounter a little girl mermaid. Flash years later and he is all grown up and he ends up having an accident at sea and ends up unconscious underwater only to be rescued by a very beautiful lady who later turns up in New York and the two of them hit it off swimmingly. Well of course the lady is the little girl mermaid and Levy's character who also encountered is determined to expose her for the half woman and half fish that she is. Nice movie with good comedy, I loved the moron twins and the secretary who got some lightening to the head. Some of the story seems a bit out there though and at times the movie gets a bit to sappy and the ending kind of did not make any sense. Overall though I thought it was rather good. They would later make a sequel that was a made for television sequel, but I have no urge to see that one.",Splash

22,OllieSuave-007,Not a bad fish tale.,7,19 September 2015,"This one of Tom Hanks' earlier movies, where he stars as Allen Bauer who is looking for true love, and finds it in Madison (Daryl Hannah) whom, unbeknown-st to him, is a mermaid.The romance and chemistry between Allen and Madison are pretty heartfelt and touching, with Allen looking to balance his busy work life and finding a companion to Madison adjusting to life in the city. Her only have seven days to remain in the human world before she returns to the sea serve as a pretty suspenseful backdrop to the story.Not bad acting from Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah, with a steady-paced plot that can be both dramatic and funny. John Candy delivered some humor, though I've found his character a little annoying at times, as well as Eugene Levy. I don't know if filmmakers think actors being overly zealous, frustrated or excited define good acting, because that is exactly what Levy does for much of the movie. He screamed a lot and acted frustrated with everyone he encountered, which I thought was excruciatingly annoying and irritating and brought down the movie. Fortunately, his character was a little redeeming toward the second half of the story.Overall, it's a not a bad classic '80s tale that is good for some mild laughs and romance.Grade B-",Splash
23,sddavis63,A Pleasant Time Waster Of Little Substance But Some Significance,5,15 February 2017,"I remember watching this shortly after it was released and finding it to be a fun little movie. Looked at over 30 years later it strikes me as memorable mostly because it was some of the earliest work from some of the significant names associated with it. Most notably, because of how his career evolved, this was actually the first big screen role for Tom Hanks, whose previous work had been in television. It was also an early role for Daryl Hannah, and an early piece of directing from Ron Howard. So it's not an insignificant movie at all, although it does have little of substance.Hanks played Allen Bauer, a young New York businessman. As a boy he fell off a boat and before he was rescued he encountered a mermaid. Years later, the mermaid (played by Hannah) shows up naked (not gratuitously) at the Statue of Liberty, apparently looking for Allen. Dry and on land, she has legs, so Allen doesn't realize that she's a mermaid, and quickly falls in love with her, finding her innocence both appealing and mysterious. I thought Hanks and Hannah were both very good in their roles. They shared a nice chemistry and made the relationship believable. The supporting cast featured John Candy as Allen's brother and Eugene Levy as a scientist who is convinced that mermaids exist and wants to prove it by capturing Madison (as the mermaid has chosen to be called.) I guess the performances from Candy and Levy were all right, but I found their characters too over the top. They took the focus off the relationship between Allen and Madison, which probably could have been explored in more depth.In the end, this can be called a pleasant way to waste some time, and an interesting look at some of the early work from people who went on to bigger and better things.

24,ThomasDrufke,Harmless Splash,6,23 July 2014,"What I really like about Splash is that it doesn't try to be anything more than a laid back comedy. There are too many movies today that attempt at a deeper meaning than necessary. Splash is just a typical 80's romantic comedy that can be fun for all ages. Its led by Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah. During the times that they both communicate the chemistry is great, even with a bit of a rocky start. Of course Hanks and Hannah are the only reason I watched the film. When you read the premise it sounds like a Disney Channel film (I'm looking at you Aqua Marine) so when I ended up watching it I was pleasantly surprised. Now the movie has a lot of eye rolling moments but also a bit of charm to it as well.For beginners I don't understand how the film can be given a PG rating with nudity across the entire 100 minutes, but the script and characters are easy enough to follow for a young age. With that being said you know exactly where the movie is headed, which can be annoying. I did find all the scenes with John Candy to be hilarious but you don't get comedic relief from anywhere else though.But as I have said the film doesn't try to do too much with fish out of water premise. It knows when its silly and it plays off itself. Its not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but I cant say I'm disappointed with it either.+John Candy+Music brings charm to the romance+doesnt try to do too much-A bit too silly at times-Predictable-PG rating?6.2/10",Splash
25,g-bodyl,Hanks at his Funniest!,9,18 December 2014,"Before Tom Hanks became known for his dramatic turns, he used to be a funnyman and a successful one at that as shown in the 1980's. Splash is one of his early films and it showcases his talent. This is also an early directorial effort by Ron Howard and it is a very good one. As a romantic comedy, one may have to suspend disbelief because of the far-fletched plot. But the film itself is very likable and funny. It will endear to nearly everyone, especially fans of Tom Hanks.Howard's film is about a Manhattan bachelor named Allen Bauer who falls in love with a mermaid from Cape Cod and when their romance is made public, they must fight to save the mermaid's existence......and their love.This is Tom Hanks at his funniest. He is a really funny guy, and the film proves that. He makes many jokes and even is adept at physical humor. However, he does show a very sentimental side which comes very useful in the film. Daryl Hannah does a good job as the mermaid, even if she does learn the entire language of English in six hours. Eugene Levy was fantastic as the man trying to prove the urban legend is real. Finally, as always, John Candy is pathetically dumb but really funny and sweet-hearted in the film.Overall, Splash is a very endearing rom-com and it is a different style from what we are used to seeing with these kind of films and that is fine with me. It may not be entirely believable, but the film is about how love can find anyone, even the working man. This is a very good film and from what I see, not many people have seen this film, at least my generation hasn't. I rate this film 9/10.",Splash
26,lesleyharris30,"A Sweet Forgetful Endeavour,",6,6 July 2016,"Splash is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. The highlight of the movie is certainly the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah, it is very sweet, at times quite heartwarming, it was certainly a complicated relationship to pull off and they did not seem to have any trouble with it. The weakest factor is certainly the fact that their relationship never feels in real danger, romantic comedies usually have their ups and downs, as this one does, but there is never a sense that they may never get back together, there is always a large sense of hope, which winds up bland for the audience. I also felt they did not work on the potential of the mermaid as well as they could have, it did not feel enough like a fantasy, it was far too grounded and hardly imaginative, the scene in the bathtub and the part where she says her name are the only moments that truly represent the promise of the mermaid premise. It is riddled with flaws, but great chemistry make Splash worth a look if you ever see it on television and are looking for a romantic comedy, just do not go out of your way to see it. A young boy who is saved from drowning by a mermaid ends up falling in love with her 20 years later. Best Performance: Tom Hanks / Worst Performance: Eugene Levy",Splash
27,Irishchatter,Cute little movie!,9,2 October 2015,"This must have the most kisses you have ever seen on any film, gee it's very romantic! Darryl Hannah and Tom Hanks developed such great relationship with playing their characters. It was funny hearing Tom Hanks shouts, no wonder he got the job of playing Woody in Toy Story. They probably scanned this movie right and well done for them putting him on the Disney team! I liked John Candy acting as his flirty older brother, he really did fit the part! I was surprised to think that he didn't get a woman in the end but oh well, he'll find more lol!Honestly, I would definitely consider this a movie to watch on Valentines day as it's just adorable!",Splash
28,filipemanuelneto,An excellent romantic comedy.,9,13 May 2020,"This film is one of the first cinema works of Tom Hanks' career, and is perhaps one of the most interesting comedies in which he entered. In fact, among the endless list of romantic comedies of the 1980s, it is one that has stood the test of time. The story tells how a mermaid falls in love with a young man, how she finds him again in adulthood, and how they struggle to be together, despite the fact that she is different and the army want to capture and study her.Nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, it has charm. The work of all involved was well harmonized for a good final product. Despite using a mythological being that doesn't exist, the film's credibility is not an issue. The film intends to use fantasy to make audiences dream, and it does it very well. Tom Hanks was young, but his excellent work here reveals talent and a promising future that, in fact, came to happen. Daryl Hannah was a beautiful woman, truly attractive and showy, and she knew how to use that in her character. She steals the spotlight whenever she appears on scene. It is curious how their careers flowed so differently, with Hanks achieving stardom and Hannah always keeping a low profile. Eugene Levy and John Candy also did well and ensure the comical moments with professionalism and effectiveness.Ron Howard is a good director and has given a lot of proofs of professionalism and competence to this day. In this film, the painstaking way in which he directed the cast and how he takes advantage of New York's landscapes and scenery is palpable. Cinematography is quite regular, but makes good use of underwater scenes, although I do not believe that the waters of New York can have the colours and life that we see here, and that they look more like the warm waters of the Caribbean or the coast of Australia . The set of the sunken ship is also a mistake and could never be real, but it is a common thing when you imagine old shipwrecks. Finally, a word of praise and appreciation for the song used in the final part of the film, in the final credits, which are one of the most beautiful parts of the entire film.I am not a fan of romantic comedies, even though I know how to enjoy them. This film, however, is one of those that I have seen several times since I was a child. I think he has aged well and I am sure we will continue to see him for a few more years.",Splash
29,leplatypus,A Wave of pleasure (DVD),7,14 August 2011,"This modern fairy tale is a good lesson to learn how to make a good movie:1) Find an original story like throwing a Mermaid in the modern America. The great strength of plotting was to really take the heart of those two worlds: For the mermaid myth, an undying love, a curse, a so lovely heart that can melt the dark ones, a lovely ending and for America, shopping, TV, the President and the military forces. 2) Choose the cast for their talent to express feelings: Hanks is perfect as a ""teen"" lover with candid, passionate and short temper while Darryl is really great to relate sweetness and wonder. 3) Sign a inspired director: Howard is able to tell the story without dragging but finding nice shots and paying attention to little details as well. 4) Locate a beautiful setting: every one has tastes but for me NYC is an amazing city even if I never went there so far. You can shoot romance, science-fiction, thriller there and the city can blend into the story. In this movie, I liked the shots of the Liberty and the WTC, especially at night, illuminated by the moon. However, the movie isn't perfect because it has some flaws: first, the story takes really big short-cuts (like to learn English in one day, to find a mermaid among millions New Yorkers, to find the bad guy at the dentist) but after all, in a fairy tall, you must leap your faith. Frankly worst, the score and songs are terribly weak and it's the lack of this final 5) ingredient that explains why I don't give ""10"".",Splash
30,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Lovable, memorable blend of fantasy and comedy that launched important careers",7,14 November 2017,"Tom Hanks, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer are legendary names in Hollywood today, and it's impressive how far they've come from a story about a woman emerging naked from the sea to flop into the arms of a 20-something produce distributor.Distilled to its essence, ""Splash"" is just that – a lonely bachelor's fantasy played out on screen. It's what writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (who previously collaborated with Howard and Grazer on ""Night Shift""), with Bruce Jay Friedman (""Stir Crazy"") do to craft this hetero-male daydream into an entertaining fish-out-of- water story (literally?) that gives it real legs (sorry).Although viewers (mostly men) will be drawn to this fantasy pretty quickly, Daryl Hannah also gets to play a goofy, atypical female lead role, which can't be underestimated in the film's success. Whether it's chomping through a lobster shell with her teeth, prancing through Bloomingdale's or just getting her fins wet in the bathtub, there's both a confidence/strength and a shyness/reserved nature to Madison – whose given name is the direct reason why you know a young woman born after 1984 named Madison. Talk about cultural impact.So much is right with Hannah's performance. An actress with more of a name or acclaim at the time might have made Madison into more of a caricature or been distractingly attractive (given how much the camera ogles her). Hannah is alluring, mysterious and quirky in a believable way. The film's funniest moments are of her gleeful misunderstandings of American culture.In his first big role, Hanks gives us a taste of what has made him lovable over the years. Allen is a strange and sad guy, especially in the beginning; Hanks has always done the part of the loser really well in terms of his comedic roles. He's at his best when he's frustrated, angry or desperate as Allen, but most of all he's enough of an everyman that he earns audience empathy and sympathy as a ""good guy."" That's all this film requires of him.""Splash"" primarily holds up due to a few clutch moments that merge fantasy and everyday comedy. Whether it's naked Madison emerging on Liberty Island and not thinking anything of it, the excellent bathtub scene or the deranged Walter Kornbluth's (Eugene Levy) attempts to expose Madison to the world, these create highly memorable and impressionable moments whether you're a kid seeing this movie on TV for the first time or a casual fan of light comedy looking to be entertained.With a little more story and character development (Why is there a coral reef in Cape Cod and why would a mermaid be there on her own?) and the avoidance of deus ex machina, ""Splash"" could have even gone beyond fantastical comedy and become something a little more meaningful. The potential is definitely apparent with these two lovers from different worlds and society's fascination with things like mermaids working against them. Nevertheless, it belongs among the '80s staples and deserves some credit for leading to all the successful Howard/Grazer team-ups and Hanks hits. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

31,imseeg,How to make love to a fish. Eighties romantic comedy classic which made Tom Hanks world famous overnight.,8,19 September 2018,"How to make love to a fish. That would sum up the bizarre story of this sweet and wild comedy featuring fantastic roles by Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah. However ludicrous the story might be, the movie really entices me with its wit and charm. Lovely and funny. Hilarious supporting role by John Candy, one of his best.The story is really about falling in love with a mermaid, played by Darryl Hannah. She is human out of the water and only becomes a fish in the water. Can fish and human get together and fall in love? Wait and see. Recommended for all ages. This is one heck of a great family film, wich could be enjoyed by young and old.The true star of this movie is undeniably Tom Hanks. The youthful energy of Tom Hanks just splashes across the screen in this movie. This movie launched his career way back in the eighties. I recently saw an old David Letterman interview with Tom Hanks prior to the release of this movie, boy did they NOT know back then how BIG Tom Hanks and this movie would become.Hanks in his younger years was an uncontrollable force of comedy and wild antics. Seen it over 10 times by now, for sure. For every Tom Hanks fan this great comedy is a must watch.

Levy (American Pie) plays scientist, Walter Kornbluth who runs into bad luck and the late, Candy (Planes, Trains & Automobiles) plays Allen's free-spirited, older brother, Freddie.

33,lisafordeay,A cute romantic fantasy,7,28 December 2013,"Splash is a Touchstone Pictures romantic fantasy comedy about a young man named Alan(played by Tom Hanks)who hasn't any luck with women. As a kid he was saved by a mermaid and falls in love with her but when his father rescues him from the water the two are apart. Years later and Alan is now a grown man working in a fish warehouse and was about to get married but his former girlfriend left him. So he decides that the best place that he finds happy to refresh his mind is Cape Cod. He of course meets a scientist played by Eugene Levy and he goes on a boat that stops working. But when he ends up trying to fix it himself he falls into the water and gets knocked out cold. Suddenly a young beautiful woman(played by Daryl Hannah) saves him and his on dry land. When he wakes up he sees the woman who is fully nude and she goes back into the water.When the young woman does go into the water again she finds Alan's wallet and goes back to the dry land to track him down,eventually she does and the two fall madly in love and she goes by Madison. But she is hiding a secret from him;could she be the mermaid that he fell for as a kid??So what do I like about this movie well for starters the acting is pretty good,the effects are great I love how you see the fins looking so life like. The Chemistry between Hanks and Hannah is really cute and adorable. Yes think of this movie as The Little Mermaid(which was this in adult form, and that 2006 film with Sara Paxton Aquamarine minus the twist of course) and you get this enjoyable flick. I finally recorded this on VHS as it was on this Xmas season and I will definitely watch it again soon. Overall its a thumbs up if you love romantic fantasies and Tom Hanks in general along with mermaids.John Candy as Freddie is hilarious in this movie RIP John Candy.",Splash

35,drqshadow-reviews,"Pleasant But Thin, it's Starting to Feel Dated",6,18 June 2014,"Tom Hanks breaks out in this light, charming, modestly funny fish-out-of-water comedy (har har) about a man's lifelong encounters with a lustily enamored mermaid. It can be tremendously naive at times, and the plot is about as telegraphed as they come, but there's something intangible about this picture that manages to gloss over many of those shortcomings. The central performance of Hanks is key, working as the plucky everyman he'd embody in most of his early repertoire, though this time it's dosed with a few fits of sharply possessive, unsettling anger. Maybe those shades just look bad in retrospect, as the film's a full generation old now, but it's tough not to cringe at such puzzling spots in the modern climate. I think the humor falls into a similar trap, in that it was probably more relevant at the time than it is today. A handful of comedies from the same era still serve as timeless examples of great humor (Ghostbusters, also released in 1984, springs to mind), and though a few of its gags and one-liners still connect, Splash isn't even in that ballpark after thirty years on the shelf. Hanks's easy rapport with John Candy is worth celebrating, though, and Daryl Hannah is positively breathtaking as the sweet, innocent fish-tailed beauty at the center of all the action. Simple, straight entertainment that's beginning to fade as it grows older.",Splash
36,mattkratz,a classic comedy,9,27 April 2013,"This is a true ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy and one of my favorites. It is a good example of perfect casting (especially Darryl Hannah as the mermaid and John Candy as the lovingly in-the-way brother) and a cast working well together. It is one of my two favorite mermaid movies along with Aquamarine. It starts off with Tom Hanks's character as a young boy being rescued from drowning by Hannah's character at the same age. It picks up later at the time the movie was set in New York City. Hanks is a busybody who runs into the mermaid again, except he doesn't recognize her (would you?, and he falls in love with her.My favorite scenes are the Statue of Liberty scene, the department store scene with the TV sets and where she learns English, and where Eugene Levy is spraying the wrong people with water trying to prove that she's a mermaid.This is a must for anybody who loves comedy and a movie with Tom Hanks, Darryl Hannah, and/or John Candy in it.

The resulting script is not all that good though. Ron Howard does keep things very jovial, and this, along with Tom Hanks' infectious turn as the love-lorn mermaid admirer, probably makes the pic the reasonable entertainment that it is.Daryl Hannah is a little wooden in the movie that made her a household name, and John Candy plays Tom's slovenly brother.

But Splash is probably my all time favorite. I saw it in the there shortly after it came out, fell in love with it and through the years have watched it more times then I can remember.First off, the plot itself is delightful-man falls in love with a mermaid. Then there's the combination of Hanks and Hanna on screen. They happen to be utterly and completely adorable on screen and one of my all time favorite pairings.The movie itself is an enthralling fairytale. Daryl shines as the ethereal Madison and her scenes with Hanks are as sweet as cotton candy. The characters are all unforgettable and the underwater scenes will put you into a trance, their gloriously stunning. The movie combines romance, wit and charm with an enchanting story and captivating visuals and characters. It's the kind of movie that one knows as their watching it, will someday be a classic. Splash never gets tiresome no matter how much you see it. The movie is a classic and, though, some people maybe skeptical of a 10 of 10 rating I think it deserves nothing less.

That team pretty much carries the movie and they go through a wonderful, fun-filled adventure into a mystery of a new girl in Allen's life. Honestly, you could probably cut out the mermaid bit and have her be a crazy foreign girl, though that sounds like a movie someone has made already.It being a mermaid movie definitely makes some allowances, and makes the movie more memorable. It adds in a metaphor of the importance of communication into the writing, and gives a focal point for the story to move around and become a focus in the 3rd act. As there is barely a direct antagonist in this, this sort of conflict is usually how a romantic comedy resolves.It's a fun watch, well made for it's time, and imagine most people, especially mermaid movie fans, will enjoy it.",Splash

Enjoyed people's constant berating and disregard for him The running humor with him spraying women with water and getting punched out with bad sound effects is classically great and cheesy. Splash is a modern fairy tale type movie with all the music and atmosphere of mid-80s New York. The movie runs a briskly from start to finish.

42,screenman,A Fishy Tale,3,24 September 2008,"Well, here's another outing for the tissue-tribe. One of the many utterly talentless casting-couch queens of the 1980's, Daryl Hannah, plays her predictable screen persona as the vulnerable naiveté in a hu-man's world (check-out 'Crazy People'). This movie doesn't contain clichés; it is a cliché.Strangely popular one-dimensional Tom Hanks plays it straight against various odd-ball individuals including his huckster brother, acted by the continuously upstaging John Candy, with a little pythonesque humour supplied by a female employee who has had a bump on the head and is now in the habit of wearing her clothes out of synch. Then later, he's up against a marine-biologist with a fascist turn, attempting to expose Ms Hannah's fishy secret, of which he - Hanks - is as yet unaware (she's a mermaid, you see).It would appear that on dry land, her fishy lower-half turns into a human and most excellent pair of pins with the sundry anatomy between -so long as they stay dry. But that if they don't get a regular soaking, they'll remain as legs forever, and she will be forced to stay on land. Or something like that. Candy can be hilarious in the right scenario - check-out 'Planes,Trains & Automobiles'. Hanks? I can only conclude that he spent some time on a very influential casting-couch as well. Darly Hannah has the face and figure to have most unemancipated males -or most males, in other words - embarrassed by the scale of their spontaneous erections. She is definitely the stuff of an evolutionary 'trophy' wife. And we get to see a great deal of her meat in this movie. Then, of course, she gets to do most anything she likes, whether it be wandering about stark naked, going on a buying spree at another's expense, or destroying a shop full of TV sets. She gets to do this because she's 'pretty' and 'vulnerable' and 'naive'. Yawn. Some people see it as a 'romance'. But I offer this bi-line: Ms Hannah's character - or Madison, as she calls herself - is a mermaid, and therefor not only a different species but also a supposedly dangerous one of ancient folklore. And we learn that she has been stalking Hanks's character like some paedophilic pariah ever since he was a child. Naturally, she has waited until he is adult before taking her pursuit onto dry land, but the implication is self-evident. She uses sex to ensnare him (and a great deal of it, as the dialogue makes clear) in order to subvert him to her way of life. It's a life of immortality but from which he can never, ever escape (though he doesn't yet know it whilst he's submitting to her therapy).Am I the only one who can see the parallels with 'Dracula' in that resume? I put this to any viewer: would the scenario be quite so 'romantic' if the seducer were male? Because then the parallel with 'Dracula' would be complete. Only at the last moment, on the dockside, when she has won him over and he has cravenly agreed to join her in her oceanic world, does she spring on him the deadly caveat that there will be no going back; when he joins her, it is for ever. I suspect that if the gender-tables were turned, any male would be regarded as the most consummate manipulator and fraud under the same circumstances.However; if paedophilia, bestiality, and betrayal are your idea of the ingredients for a good romance, then keep taking the tissues.",Splash

44,Howlin Wolf,Take the plunge with this romantic comedy that manages never to get too soppy!,8,15 June 2007,"OK, so it's perhaps the definitive fish-out-of-water story (Ho, Ho!) but what really makes this work hasn't a whole lot to do with the properties of marine life. Sans fin, essentially what we've got here is two shy people whose cultural differences make it hard for them to find love together. When you break it down like that, it isn't so unusual after all, and it's actually mighty touching. Who but a complete cynic wouldn't love a charming fable that tells us we can sometimes get what we're searching for, in the end?! It may be a funny line, but we should also be able to identify with Allen's pain when he tries to come to terms with the fact that his love match is a... fish.It's this smattering of pathos which takes a funny scenario and elevates it toward becoming a classic relationship movie.

45,pyrocitor,Moisture is the essence of wetness,8,17 October 2016,"Whether fondly remembered as 'that movie your teenage self snuck into repeatedly to try to glimpse Darryl Hannah in the nude' or retroactively scrutinized as 'that hazy 80s rom-com starring Tom Hanks, a mermaid, and Tom Hanks' hair,' you'd be forgiven for dismissing Ron Howard's fantasy rom-com as more 'All Wet' than a Splash. But lo: the years have been kind to this one. Splash, silly and disposable as it might look, holds up, and then some. It's enjoyably zany, deceptively intelligent, and resonantly sweet, and a prototype for one of the most enduring romantic comedies of its decade. Okay, sure - yes, it is a hazy, fairly dopey 80s rom-com, bringing with it all the tropes you'd expect, starring Tom Hanks, his hair, a mermaid. And yes, you can glimpse Darryl Hannah in the nude (though if that's all you're here for, shame on you, you John Candy coin-dropping-skirt-peeker, you!). But Splash has so much more to offer than its bare minimum. For one, it sparkles with deceptively subtle and funny dialogue throughout, making its thoroughly silly premise surprisingly easy to drift along with, scoff-free. This is hugely helped by Howard's propensity for odd little details, with plentiful improv cutaways (I'll eat an entire lobster, shell and all, if ""let's pee down his air tube"" factored in the script) to the specificity of the tribulations of Hanks' produce-supplying profession lending the film the fresh, bouncy vibrancy of an SCTV or SNL sketch. Hanks and Hannah's romance, cheerfully nonsense a scenario as it is, is likewise oddly tender and easy to invest in. It's chock full of adorably iconic snippets (the fountain; what's likely the most memorable lobster scene outside of Annie Hall), with just enough of a snarky undercurrent to bite back excessively saccharine overtones. There's a great gag in Hannah's Madison learning English from television commercials, but speaking in crass advertising soundbites, and while Hanks' somewhat pushy marriage obsession may play as dated, there's something oddly refreshing about a PG rom-com being so comparatively transparent about the protagonists' sexual relationship. All this, and only a single, fairly tolerable, Rita Coolidge ballad on the 'dated 80s music' front, to boot! By the time we segue into the second act E.T.-style scientific scariness, it's all the more sombre and distressing by contrast, with a sneaky undercurrent of animal activism to boot (again: check out the sequence of Madison wilting in her cramped aquarium tank, and tell me Howard has nothing more on his mind than Hollywood froth). It's a substantially above-average motivation for the tired cliché of the second act romantic complication, and helps add scope to Hanks' sad sack droopiness while keeping him sympathetic. It all gets a tad unhinged by the time Howard decides to go all out with an action chase sequence bang (the prior non-sequitur dinner with the President feels a bit tacked on as well), but it's still all good, engaging fun, with enough of a daftly sweet ending to tie it all up with a glittery, sequined bow (from Saks Fifth Avenue, natch). Still, there's no forgetting that, cultural currency-wise, Splash is largely remembered as the breakout hit cementing Tom Hanks as a bankable leading man. Watching him here, it's no surprise as to why - he's nearly bursting with exasperated charm and manic energy, flitting from angsty meltdowns bemoaning his inability to love to his flamboyant gestures of finally expressing it, all encapsulating his patented everyman charisma to a tee. Similarly, Daryl Hannah is almost unbearably sweet as lovestruck mermaid Madison, projecting a pristinely otherworldly vibe that makes her all the more credible and likable. As Hanks' cheerfully lowlife brother, John Candy essays his zany, sleazy windbag persona to slapstick, one-liner-riffing perfection. He's absolutely hysterical, only to subsequently pull the rug out from viewers and launch into an unexpectedly impassioned, sentimental monologue that makes you rethink his entire character from the onset. Finally, Eugene Levy chews scenery with the ferocity of a deranged, starving rat, as the jilted scientist desperate to expose Madison's existence, and Levy's tenacious commitment to his character's sadistic, braying weirdness makes him all the funnier and more sympathetic. Splash may trot through the gamut of tried-and-true rom-com clichés (this time with more mermaids), but does so with such a twinkle in its eye and enough genuine, heartfelt material at play, that it's nigh irresistible, and infectiously watchable. But what's that you say: a remake in the works? With Channing Tatum as the (**feeble Zoolander cough**) Mer-man? Well, if it's anywhere near as sweet, clever, and full of unpredictable silliness as its predecessor? Dive in, Channing. -8/10",Splash
46,RNMorton,The first part's a gem,8,9 July 2003,"Romantic comedy that starts much better than it ends.  Story of life-long affection between mermaid (Hannah) and ordinary Joe (Hanks) is very sexy in an innocent way, funny and touching.  Then things get serious and much of the early magic is spoiled.  Film would have been much better served to keep light tone throughout.  My suggestion - watch the first 1:10, then go someplace else.",Splash
47,Stampsfightclub,Heart warming romantic comedy,8,20 August 2008,"In the first of Ron Howard's and Tom Hanks' collaborations, Hanks stars as Allen Bauer, an unlucky in love man who travels to Cape Cod, where he meets a beautiful woman, who has a secret, she is a mermaid.In perhaps a forgotten gem of the 80's, Howard delivers a heart warming tale about one man and his unlucky in love life, and how the extraordinary can bring out the hearts desires in a truly good funny and ultimately tale.Hardly his best role, Hanks still delivers in a cliché hero role as Allen, someone all men can relate to. A man who needs to get over his own personal fear in his pursuit for happiness.Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill) is excellent in the role of Madison the mermaid. The way Hannah portrays her makes you wonder how a real person would feel coming into an unknown environment and having to learn someone else's language. She is a joy to watch and the on screen relationship with Hanks is perfect, exactly what was needed to produce the wonderful outcome.Who says romantic comedies are soft mushy stuff? There is plenty of action and suspense in this 1984 comedy to keep everyone entertained.This is a true family classic, an old fashioned soft tale that is consistently entertaining and funny, something which is rare in modern day cinema.Eugene Levy (SCTV Network 90) is the funniest in the entire film with a daft character who is simply lovable despite being the villain of the picture.The whole concept of scientific experiments and animal cruelty is an intriguing side story, and makes you think what would happen today if an unknown creature was found.Though consistent and funny, it is so by following plenty of conventions, which can give an essence of predictability, but nonetheless it is a heart warming entertaining tale.",Splash
48,gab-14712,An Enchanting Early Ron Howard Film!,8,7 April 2020,"Ron Howard's Splash is such a charming, likable film. Who can resist the urge to smile when watching this adorable movie. The film is a complete turnaround from Howard's directorial debut, 1982's The Night Shift. That particular movie was a hardcore, raunchy R-rated film. Two years later, we get a very sweet film about a Manhattan bachelor falling in love.....with someone out of this world. This movie shows you how versatile Ron Howard is as a director. He made a career of making films in different styles/genres, and this was the start of it.The film has been known for two major things. Firstly, this film is the first one distributed under Touchstone, Walt Disney's new studio. Disney made a name for themselves over the years by producing films for children. They now wanted to make for adult-friendly fare without tarnishing the legacy of the studio, so that is where they created Touchstone. Splash is the one to bring the studio into the light.Each film always has some little-known trivia associated with it, and this film is no exception. The name of the lead female character is Madison. Beautiful name, right? In the movie, she got her name from Madison Avenue, a Manhattan street. In the 1980's, Madison would be an unusual name to call a girl. But after research had been done, it has been correlated that the use of Madison as an acceptable girl's name has to do with this movie. Now go impress your friends/folks with this lovely piece of movie trivia!Let's go right into the plot! Allen Bauer (Tom Hanks) manages a produce company and also works with his older, well-meaning brother Freddie (John Candy). Twenty years prior, Allen almost drowned and was rescued by someone....or something unknown. In present day timing, he almost drowns again and once again someone...or something comes to the rescue. Here is where we meet Madison (Daryl Hannah). Madison actually lives in the sea...as a mermaid...and she followed Allen to NYC. She keeps her secret to herself, but Allen falls in love with her. She needs to be careful because scientist Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy) thinks something strange is happening.Baby-faced Tom Hanks! America's most beloved man! It's hard to remember that before he was a dramatic superstar, he exceled in comedies. 1980's, man! Splash is one of his earliest roles, and I thought he did a great job here. The man who cannot attract a woman....unless she is a fish. I find it ironic that the famed critic Roger Ebert hated this casting choice. Hanks was still relatively unknown at the time, but his charisma certainly charmed audiences and myself. John Candy, although may not have much screentime, is as lovable as always. If you like slapstick, you will like Eugene Levy's performance. He is the bad guy, but I did enjoy the physical humor from his character. Daryl Hannah is sweet, naïve, and this actually may be her best role. She certainly has the looks for a beautiful mermaid.Splash is a very enchanting film. The beginning of the film, during the underwater scenes playing to Lee Holdridge's score really puts you into a trance. I thought the production team did a great job in making the mermaid's tale seem not fake at all. In addition to the light fun and big heart, the film is funny. Whether it is Levy's physical humor or Hannah's mermaid learning English in one entire day, there are many laughs to be had.Splash is one of those films that you do not see anymore. Most comedies are raunchy and R-rated. I like those, but I also like these kind of films. Films with big hearts that the entire family can enjoy. It's not perfect by any means, but it's just a light-hearted, whimsy adventure about falling in love. If you like the teaming of Rom Howard and producer Brian Grazer, this is one of their early ones and you can see where they got their magic from.My Grade: B+",Splash
49,ja_kitty_71,Another mermaid film that I love,10,25 June 2008,"Here is another mermaid film that I love. It's also the best film of the 1980s with essence of one of my favorite stories ""The Little Mermaid."" The film starts when Allen Bauer as a kid. He jumped off the boat that was sailing off the coast of Cape Cod, as if drawn by a strange force. But was rescued from drowning by a young mermaid and he still has memories of her.20 years later, jilted as an adult, Allen grabs a cab and heads off to Cape Cod to recuperate. Dropped on the wrong side of the shore, he gets a local to ferry him across the bay in a small boat. But Allen cannot swim so he falls overboard (and losing his wallet in the surf), until he was once again rescued by the same mermaid who is now grown up. The mermaid with the missing wallet in hand, searches for Allen in New York by sprouting legs when her tail dried up. On finding Allen and is given the name of Madison, they fall in love. But Madison fears how he will react when he finds out she is not human, she needs to soak and unfurl her tail from time to time, which leads to complications, including her capture by the government for scientific study.I love the underwater shots, they're really pretty and I love the end-title song performed by Rita Coolidge ""Love Came for Me."" You know, I may not remember watching the sequel that was made four years later. Though I think I did and I don't know why I bought that up. All I know is that I think the original is better, because to me the original is always best when is comes to TV and film.",Splash
50,Maziun,Not your typical romantic comedy,6,30 November 2013,"I'm not quite sure why this movie was nominated for best screenplay. Still , the story deserve some praise . The fantasy element brings something new to the genre and the story feels a little different than typical romantic comedy made in Hollywood . It's pure 80's unpretentious fun.Daryl Hannah is convincing as the mermaid . Eugene Levy is nice as the asshole who has a change of heart. This is the movie that began Tom Hanks career . He gives his typical likable average guy performance here. Most fun comes from John Candy who plays his overconfident , big mouthed and immature brother.""Splash"" is a nice little fairytale. A pleasant way to spend your time. It's a romantic comedy , yet it never gets too sappy. I did laugh a couple of times and I had a good time despite I'm not a fan of the genre.

Good comic relief from John Candy, who does a great job. Tom Hanks is good too. And Darryl Hannah is great as the little mermaid we all cheer for. You can almost see the purity and the innocence in her eyes. The movie would be so much better, though, without some annoying facts. I never thought, for example, that was so easy to spot a BMW in Manhattan's traffic chaos. Also, there's going to be other full moons. Why is it that the mermaid can't come back after she leaves the Big Apple? And if I liked most of the characters, I didn't find Eugene Levy's one to be funny. It's so 80's I guess! But in the end, watch the movie anyway. It will leave you with a good feeling.Seen at home, in Toronto, on March 3rd, 2006.

52,FloatingOpera7,The Little Mermaid In 1980's New York City,7,9 April 2007,"Splash (1984): Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, John Candy, Eugene Levy,, Shecky Greene, Dody Goodman, Richard B. Shull, Bobby Di Cicco, Howard Moris, Patrick Cronin, David Knell, Tony Di Benedetto, Charles Walker, Rnoald F. Hoiseck, Joe Grifasi, Lowell Ganz, Maurice Rice, Cheryl Howard, Pierre Epstein, Valerie Wildman, Jack Denton, Nick Cinardo, Fil Formicola, Clare Peck, Jodi Long, Amy Ingersoll, Jack Hallett, Bill Smitrovich, Nancy Raffa, Jason Late, David Nelson, Jill Jacobson, Vincent Jerosa, Charles Mitchell, Nick Vallelonga...Director Ron Howard, Screenplay Brian Grazer, Bruce Jay Friedman, Lowell Ganz.From 1984, this is Ron Howard's romantic comedy inspired by the beloved children's fairy tale The Little Mermaid, even before the beloved Disney film took hold of everyone's notion of mermaid-and-male romance. It stars a young Tom Hanks, before his success as an actor, at a time when he was doing mostly comedy. He plays Allen Bauer, a New York boy who as a child fell off a boat and nearly drowned but was rescued by a mysterious mermaid (Daryl Hannah). Years later as an adult, he and his brother Freddie (John Candy) reside and work in New York City as product shipping men by a pier. As fate would have it, Allen reunites with the beautiful mermaid. Lost, confused, mute and nude, he takes her in as a guest in his apartment and later as a lover. She learns English through watching television and avoids revealing her true identity as a mermaid. When she is out of water, she is human (with legs) and when she is wet, she becomes a mermaid. Now, for today's young audience, one will note the similarities to the recent film ""Aquamarine"". Turns out Aquamarine is inspired by this film, but Splash is the greater film. The screenplay, the work of three talents, is witty, comedic and yet touchingly romantic. Despite the fantasy element, and even fantasy-within-fantasy (the mermaid couldn't talk and then learned English after one day at Bloomingdale's ?) is still a work of complete order and balance. We really do believe that this is logically happening in 1980's New York City. Ron Howard's direction is equally superb. Tom Hanks is doing a fine job, but he is not doing anything challenging. Neither is John Candy, who is clearly just doing the thing he was best known for. But we have to take in mind that this was not a serious romance and it was the first of many romantic comedies that would gradually take over film. The 1980's saw many romantic comedies that would become classics. Moonstruck with Cher for instance. Unfortunately, Splash did not make a big splash at the time of its release. The ending was a bit of a surprise and too sugary-sweet as Tom Hanks leaves the mortal world behind for her. So while this film is not a classic per se, it is a fine document of 80's comedy. And they used to make them a lot better than they do now. This is a lovely romantic film and one that can be appreciated by the whole family. With music by Lee Holrdige that is very moving and splendid cinematography by Donald Peterman. This is, by the way, also quite a date movie.",Splash
53,elicopperman,Boy meets Mermaid in New York City,7,6 September 2020,"In 1984, the Walt Disney Company made a breakthrough with their alternative distribution division Touchstone Pictures when they released Splash. Directed by Ron Howard, produced by Brian Grazer and starring Tom Hanks in the lead role, the film was a critical darling and commercial hit on its original release, and to this day remains one of the most important films in the company's history. As for how it holds up nowadays, as cheesy as it may seem, this movie might be one of the better rom-coms of the 1980s, and it shows how much free will a movie can have when a company backs off.The movie centers around a single young man named Allen Bauer who falls in love with a mysterious woman who is actually a mermaid, but she can only stay on land for a certain amount of time before she has to return to the sea. Arguably, the strongest aspect of the movie is the relationship between Allen and the mermaid, named Madison, as their personalities differentiate from one another to build off their distinctive roles in society. Allen is a lonely man yearning for the right mate to come along who he can have a happy life with, and Madison is so fascinated by Allen and the human world that she becomes a literal fish out of water. Granted, based on this boy meets girl scenario, the outcome is certainly predictable, but the chemistry between the two works so well that the obvious shortcomings aren't as big of a deal to the overall picture. In addition, Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah are so cute on screen that one could almost imagine the roles were written for them. It's not every day when chemistry between two actors on screen feels as genuine as it feels surreal.As for the lighthearted fun, there's also some hefty laughs and solid acting to go along with the movie. John Candy is delightfully goofy as Allen's lunky bigshot brother Freddie, Eugene Levy hams up his role as the overly jealous Walter Kornbluth to a tee, and much of the cast around the leads supply the necessary reactions to a man dating such a bizarre woman (that they haven't a clue about). In terms of the humor, a lot of it is centered around the characters, as what they experience in their surroundings and their own critical decisions drive the comedy in the right direction. Some of the better laughs come from Madison exploring the wonders of New York City commercialism and getting wrapped up in all the weirdness that an inner city can offer. In contrast, it does make the more dramatic moments all the more gratifying, especially when Madison can only be up on land for a certain amount of time, something that could break Allen's heart. I'm sure anyone has gone through a relationship like that, and it can be really hard to handle the emotions properly.Now with that said, as enjoyable as this movie is, there is one fatal flaw that keeps it from being spectacular: the third act. Much of the first two acts also deal with scientist Walter Kornbluth trying to expose Madison as a mermaid, which admittedly makes for an entertaining side plot that could lead to a fascinating rivalry battle between himself and Allen. However, what ends up happening is that Madison is abducted by the government and used for dissection. On top of that and much of the showdown being a crazy getaway to let Madison escape, the only way for Allen to be with Madison after all this is if he jumped in the sea. Based on all of that, the movie ends up overcomplicating itself when it should have just focused on the rivalry of Allen and Walter and Madison leaving for good when she has no time left, thus having Allen only being able to see her once every year while he goes off and actually finds another mate. In addition to one of the dumbest endings in film history, this right here is an example as to why you should rethink your concept before you approve your movie for production.But even in spite of its confusing plot points and disastrous ending, Splash is still a thoroughly enjoyable rom com fantasy with enough laughs and drama to get one into the whole ordeal. Even with a third act that needed some major rework in the story department, the overall heart and spirit still remains intact, and it makes sense why the movie is still fondly remembered to this day. As far as nostalgic rom coms go, this one might be one of the most imaginative, since it's not everyday you have a story where the boy ends up with the mythical being for a girl...well, besides another Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale.",Splash
54,funtasticfour,"Original and not bad, but not great either",6,2 April 2020,"For some reason I never saw this as a kid. Perhaps it was the threat of possible nudity or something, or maybe I wasn't interested because it was mushy. Either way, I've finally watched it and it's fairly mediocre. Not much for laughs or story. It was nice to see John Candy again, but also surprising that this was even on Disney +",Splash
55,DavidSim240183,A quite literal fish out of water story,8,1 March 2007,"Before Ron Howard concentrated his energy on making films that are very messagey and thought-provoking (even if he doesn't always succeed), back at the beginning of his career he was a little more wild and adventurous. Films like Night Shift and Grand Theft Auto were rather more zanier than anything he does nowadays. But the film that propelled him to the A-list of directors was Splash.Splash also feels different from Ron Howard's films of recent years. This is a film made with a great deal of zest and obvious fun on Howard's part. Its a simple but magical fairytale that you really grow to love. It also marked the first of Howard's associations with Tom Hanks. A friendship that still continues today with hits like the superb Apollo 13 and the completely overrated Da Vinci Code.There are not many live-action films about mermaids, which makes Splash rather unique. Its not a perfect film. It has a few flaws, its a little too lightweight and the ending is slightly odd but its also a fun way to pass the time.Allan Bauer (Hanks) co-manages a fruit & veg market with his brother Freddie (The late and great John Candy). He's longed for love in his life ever since he was rescued from drowning as a boy by a mermaid. He's never forgotten the incident. And neither has she.After Allan is dumped by his girlfriend, he goes back to Cape Cod to be alone. The place where he met the mermaid. But when he gets into trouble, he is rescued by the same one. Only now she's a beautiful grownup mermaid (wonderfully played by a perfectly cast Daryl Hannah).Allan goes back to New York and she follows. When on dry land, she has legs. But if she ever gets wet, she turns back into a mermaid. She names herself Madison (after the street) and starts a relationship with Allan that blossoms into true love. But trouble looms on the horizon from an obsessed scientist Dr Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy) who wants to expose Madison to the world.Splash is made with such a bubbly and infectious cheer its almost impossible to dislike. Here's your chance to see Tom Hanks at the beginning of his career before he became a favourite with the Oscar crowd. Its quite nice to see him in a part where he's just out to have fun. Big is still his best film performance of the 80s (and 90s and 00s!) but Splash has him on good form.And John Candy is quite the scene stealer as the boisterous and larger than life Freddie. He's obviously having a good time in this film. Playing a part not that far removed from the wild partying he indulged in real life. Although Candy is good, there are moments of painful anguish with foreknowledge of what was to come for him.But the shining light of the entire film is the lovely and criminally underrated Daryl Hannah. Madison is a part she was born to play. Its hard to imagine any other woman more suited to the part of a mermaid than Daryl Hannah. With her long golden hair, statuesque figure, shiny baby blues and natural beauty she is just captivating.Not only is she physically matched to the role, but Hannah has the right personality too. Sometimes Daryl Hannah can seem a little spacy in her film roles, but its exactly that quality that makes her so perfect in the part of Madison. She brings a child-like sense of wonder and astonishment that makes her a very appealing screen presence, and she even has a majestic grace in the underwater scenes (which are beautifully photographed by the way).The real fun to be had is Madison navigating her way through a world she doesn't really understand. She eats lobster ravenously, she thinks nothing of walking through crowds stark naked, and absorbs knowledge from television where she picks up the human language in a matter of hours. Without Hannah, Splash might have been considerably less than it is.But not everything about Splash works. The subplot concerning Eugene Levy's character feels unnecessary. All his attempts to expose Madison end the same way to the point of repetitiveness. And his character has quite an abrupt change halfway through. He goes from being an obsessed, obnoxious paranoid man to a person who sympathises with Madison's plight and helps her escape. Its a change that doesn't quite ring true.And the ending left me a little puzzled. I could understand Allan wanting to be with Madison. But I couldn't quite believe he would leave everything behind to live with her under the sea. Its a slightly strange climax that reminded me of a similar situation in the time-travel romance Kate & Leopold. I just couldn't accept what I was seeing.Nevertheless, Splash is a bouncy and very appealing comedy. One of Ron Howard's best films, and thanks to the cast (but mostly Hannah) it stays afloat and never sinks. So take the plunge!",Splash

I loved all of the side characters too, including John Candy (The cheeky older brother) and Eugene Levy (The crazed scientist who seeks to prove to the world that mermaids are real), as they were well developed and helped bring a very witty and comedic balance to an otherwise quite romantic movie. The movie was very sweet and heartwarming, as it teaches us that love is infinite, no matter who the person is. It was hilarious watching Madison trying to adapt to the modern world, whilst displaying how different she is to the normal human. What made their romance was so powerful was how understanding Allan was, as despite her bizarre and clueless demeanour, he still loved her for who she is. It was simply adorable!

67,gottogorunning,great comedy,8,9 August 2005,"This movie really brought a fairy tale type story to life. A must see for everyone. I guess this film obviously makes for a great date movie. This is an excellent romantic comedy about a man and a mermaid who fall in love for each other in a modern fairy tale. This film was one of Tom Hanks' earliest hits that made him the huge superstar that he is today. Co-star Daryl Hannah, who plays Madison the mermaid, became herself a huge star from this film, but now times have changed in her film career, which has faded during the 1990s, which is sad. She is a great actress. John Candy plays Tom Hanks' older brother with Eugene Levy playing a crazy scientist who tries to prove that mermaids exist. These two provide some of the film's hilarious comedic moments.The romantic chemistry between Hanks' Allen Bauer and Hannah's Madison are just well done. Their characters' relationship just becomes true romance throughout the entire film. When Madison eventually gets caught as a mermaid, Allen realizes that Madison is the one true love that he can never lose. Allen, along with his brother and the crazy scientist, band together to rescue her. Later, Allen realizes that Madison was the little girl mermaid that rescued him when he was a young boy in the film's opening flashback sequence.Splash was directed by Ron Howard, who is, of course, one of Hollywood's great filmmakers. A movie about a mermaid has to be good, and Splash does this so well. Tips off to the crew of this movie who made it so real. The underwater sequences are well done, as well as Daryl Hannah herself as the mermaid. She is just utterly believable as a mermaid! I must say that she is just so sexy in the rubber mermaid tail suit. She swims in it so well! I really thought that she played Madison to perfection! I can really enjoy a movie about a mermaid nowadays.On one other note, most people probably don't know this, but Splash was followed up by a Disney TV movie sequel in 1988 that aired in two parts on the ABC network on what used to be a show called ""The Disney Sunday Movie"". The sequel was called ""Splash, Too"" and starred Todd Waring as Allen Bauer and Amy Yasbeck (movies ""Problem Child"" 1 and 2, ""The Mask"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"", and TV's ""Wings"") as Madison Bauer, now married from a Neptune ceremony. This sequel has Allen and Madsion come back to New York from their island hideaway to help Allen's brother Freddie (played by Donovan Scott) save Bauer Produce from going out of business. Madison has her own agenda later on as she finds a dolphin she knows from her past, named Salti, captured by another crazy scientist for study. Not a great sequel of course (as sequels usually are) but it was sort of nice to know that Allen and Madison had another adventure together. There were some funny moments in the movie. It was particularly challenging to see Madison cope with suburban life and trying to understand how to be a housewife. I wasn't bothered that much with the recasting of new actors as these characters either. I did like Amy Yasbeck's portrayal of Madison in this sequel. She too swims and looks nice in a mermaid fish tail as well! A worthy successor to Daryl Hannah in her own right. Some people who have seen Splash, Too think that its even better than the original film. And to others, its an awful sequel that doesn't compare to the original. Some folks even think that Amy Yasbeck's portrayal of Madison is even better than Daryl Hannah's! Mixed reviews none the less. Unfortunately, this sequel is not available on home video to my knowledge.",Splash

69,funky_cherry86,"Splash, An Excellent Love Story",9,1 January 2005,"Splash is one of those romantic comedies that leaves viewers entertained and enchanted at the story about the love between a man and his mermaid girlfriend. The chemistry between Tom Hanks & the gorgeous Daryl Hannah was charming and sweet, they made a cute couple in this adorable movie.When Allen Bauer was eight years old he had an accident while on vacation with his family, he fell off a ship into the water and was rescued by a mermaid (MacKarvich). 20 years later Allen, (Hanks) is grown up and running his father's fruit produce business with his older, bachelor fun loving brother Freddie (Candy).One day Allen returns to Cape Cod because of old memories, to this day he still remembers the accident but doesn't know for sure if there was a mermaid.While heading to Cape Cod Allen has another accident and is rescued by the same mermaid, she travels to New York to find the man she saved twice. Once they meet again sparks begin flying and he names her Madison (Hannah) after a street sign. Meanwhile scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Levy) is determined to find and show people that this girl is a mermaid, after a few days Allen's fallen in love with her not knowing why she acts so strange or comes from a place with no music, ice or clothes. When Madison's secret is revealed and she's captured by other scientists Allen, Dr. Kornbluth and Freddie make a daring rescue attempt and free her from government hands. Afterwards Allen & Madison leave New York behind and swim away together to her home. I found this movie to be enchanting and very romantic, Eugene Levy's performance as the mad scientist was comical and funny, John Candy's laughable and his role as Allen's brother was hilarious.",Splash
70,elisereid-29666,Wonderful and full of surprises,9,18 April 2020,"This movie is a perfect example of one where you *think* you know where the story will go...and then it surprises you. By the end of the first reel, there seems to be an obvious villain, cardboard characters and a clear-cut path to an ending we can already picture. We're wrong!Eugene Levy's character starts out obnoxious and is clearly the villain of the film from his first scene, but then he does a complete 180. John Candy's character seems unlikable from the minute we see him, and we think he's going to turn out to be an obstacle in the plot. But by the climax, we see him as lovable, in his strange way. And by the middle of the third act, just when we think we know how it will end, the movie takes us into a *fourth* act. And in most movies, finding out that there's still a quarter of the film left to go before we end can be a drag, but Splash is endlessly enjoyable and watchable, so it's like a present to the audience.It is inevitable, in a film like this, that there will be a scene where Hannah's character is revealed to her lover as a mermaid-that's no spoiler. But the way Tom Hanks' character reacts is entirely true to life. He goes through various stages of reactions, including betrayal, before finally coming down to acceptance. In a lot of movies, he would have jumped the gun and accepted her sooner, if not right away, but the script knows how unlikely this is. And the fact that John Candy, whose character alternates between jerky and pleasant, precipitates this development shows us how wrong we were about him.This is less of a ""joke"" movie than many light comedies, and more of a ""feel good"" movie. And trust me, by the end, you will feel good, even if you don't 100 percent buy the last scene.",Splash
71,rchrdshelt,A Wonderful Film,10,13 August 2005,"I saw this for the first time on TV when I was 11 and absolutely loved it. Since then I've always tried to catch it every time its been on TV over the past few years, and unsurprisingly it is quite often thanks to it being a wonderfully moving, feel good film that features superb performances from a talented cast along with a terrific script and Ron Howard's splendid Direction. So I ended up seeing it for the first time in over a year today and it was just as refreshing and joyful as it was for me before.Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah are brilliant in the leads and have a lovely chemistry together that really makes the film work so well and must be one of the best if not THE best chemistry i've ever seen in a romantic comedy. However, another large factor that makes it work is the comedic elements that are played to perfection by John Candy and Eugene Levy, although Hanks and Hannah get several as well. Candy especially has some moments that had me laughing for ages and I won't spoil them for you. But, more importantly it doesn't try to be a straight comedy because it isun't meant to be and the script and Howard know this. So, while the film does include several hilarious moments, they don't allow it to upstage the heart of the story which is the loving relationship between the two leads and do allow for some wonderfully sentimental moments between Hanks and Hannah throughout.Without spoiling too much let me just say that the film's ending really is the icing on the cake as far as the whole film is concerned and as the credits roll you are guaranteed to have a smile on your face. I certainly did and did for most of the film as a matter a fact. It really is great and I really did love the film that much. I hope it goes on to become a classic and judging by other comments I've read on here I'm not the only one who thinks that.Absolutely wonderful 10/10",Splash
72,walkingwithprimeval,Took me all these years to finally see Splash,7,23 June 2021,"Upon my initial viewing of Splash (1984), I really didn't know what to expect other than some silly old fantasy-romance film about Woody's voice actor falling in love with a non-redhead fish-lady. But to my delight, the film had quite a fair bit of well-timed comedy that was surprisingly good and not agonisingly painful to sit through (unlike the case with most torturous romantic-comedies I can think of). And speaking of things that are agonisingly painful to sit through, I thought the whole romantic angle with our two extremely-compelling leads was going to bore me to tears but it actually worked miraculously for me as Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah both have some rather sweet and charming chemistry together when portraying their respective characters on-screen. Full disclosure; I'm usually not the kind of guy who normally goes for a typical romance film (not one with a real-world setting, at least) as the love connection between the main characters just never seems to be convincing enough for me to truly believe in it. But in the case of this genre incorporating some fictional type of fantasy element, then I'm willing to make an exception (what can I say? I'm just a sucker for a pretty mermaid, I guess).The entire time watching this, I was quite taken aback by the design style and overall appearance they went with for the film's mermaid, with ""Madison"" having golden-blonde hair and an orangey-red fishtail (it somehow didn't feel right to me). It may just only be me and I might be completely alone on this opinion of mine but after first seeing The Little Mermaid (1989) at a very young age, I suppose I'm always going to think of a mermaid's contrasting colour-tone as more of a crimson-red hairdo and emerald-green tail-fins with nice shiny fish-scales (I'm probably too far gone to picture anything else, at this point in time). But after a brief adjustment period, I now think I'm content with her look and have even grown to like it (yep, I still thought she was kind of cute in her own unique way). Unsurprisingly, The Disney Company decided to release this under the label of their recently-established Touchstone distribution banner as its romantic plot-line dealt with the somewhat risqué subject matter of presenting the audience with a half-naked woman's bare-body in a magical context. As such, this meant it wasn't suitable for being family-friendly PG material and so with that it rightfully came to earn more of a 12A age-rating.I thought leading lady Daryl Hannah was really great in the role, and that's the thing which shocked me most of all because I found everything else I've seen her in to be not that good; Clan or the Cave Bear (1986) was just OK even if a tad underwhelming, I haven't seen the Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (1993) remake but I take it it's better than the original one, and I didn't even make it to the end of boring old Blade Runner (1982). In Splash, most of the comedy stems from her compelling naivety and I honestly found her little interactions with different things on land to be genuinely amusing (and F. Y. I.; being naive isn't the same as being stupid, as it simply means the character is smart but just doesn't know any better when thrown into uncertain situations that are unfamiliar to them). There's a myriad of comedic potential you could mine from a funny concept such as this (in a literal ""fish-out-of-water"" scenario), and it very much reminds me of how Ariel acted in The Little Mermaid (1989) when she was totally enamoured with our human culture and wanted to learn everything there is to know about the surface world above. I simply love characters like that, having their personalities constantly radiating with intrigue the whole time (it's the simple stuff like this that I really appreciate and ultimately look for in a right good movie).I felt like director Ron Howard did a pretty good job with this film. To be honest, most of his filmography consists of movies that I have very mixed opinions on. However, I personally feel there's been more hits than misses when it comes to some of his more earlier works. I am aware of the fact that the film's story was followed up on with a perfectly passable made-for-TV sequel a few years later, titled Splash Too (1988). But I think it has the same fundamental issue the Grease 2 (1982) failure had where the studios have a really successful movie on their hands and they didn't know what to do with it, so they end up retreating a lot of the same ground as before by trying to recapture that same magic they had the first time around (only thing is, you can't catch lighting in a bottle twice). And suffice to say although it was a decent watch, it wasn't able to fully recreate what it was that made the first one's quality so endearingly special.",Splash
73,thrwmbsbgkdoepmcjrmrdw,Enjoyed It,7,14 January 2008,"Tom Hanks really broke through in the movie. He showed that he truly was the best pick for that movie. He also showed that he is the best in the business. His movies from this point on just get better and better. The story line is cute and likable and has something that everyone can somewhat relate to. It proves the old saying ""You can't help who you fall in love with."" I thought that the acting was really well done not only by Hanks but by everyone. It was also well written. It was well cast. And over all a wonderful film. One to be enjoyed by all ages and in all times. The movie is one of the best movies that I've seen from it's time period and genre. Also one of my favorite Tom Hanks movies. If you have never seen this movie, don't walk, run to go rent it and watch by yourself or with a loved one. Its a movie that everyone can enjoy no matter their age. It's a fun movie that holds special moments for everyone. I love how it shows that each character is very well developed by the writers and the actors. It's an over all awesome movie. And by far one of the best movies ever to be made. It is different each time you see it too. You notice something about the movie that you never noticed before every time you watch it. I would highly recommend to any one if you haven't seen this movie to go out and see it. But more it's a great movie on things that are real, true and touch your heart. The movie is true to the heart and soul of it. Its beautifully made and acted.So young or old, male or female, go see the movie. It's truly one of the best you'll ever see.",Splash

It's been my pleasure tonight to watch it with my 8 year old boy, all the scenes I remembered and some of those I didn't came flooding back and we had a real hoot.Howard manages to create a whimsical comedy/fantasy but it's not without depth too. Hanks, in one of his earliest roles is superb as 'unlucky in love' Allen, who in the end shows that love has no boundaries. Daryl Hannah was even more beautiful than I remember and, particularly in the early scenes where she doesn't speak English shows why she was perfectly cast for the role. Eugene Levy and John Candy add the humour and make it an all round joyous watch.I won't pretend it hasn't got 'flaws'. I mean why doesn't she just climb out of the tank, dry herself off and walk outta there, but this isn't and doesn't pretend to be some kind of statement film. I simply can't judge it that way For me, it was a childhood classic, and now is simply a classic in its own right",Splash

79,PayOrPlay,Well-made comedy with a disturbing undertone of pessimism,7,15 August 2002,"Splash is a really well-made Hollywood fantasy comedy, with early Tom Hanks already developing into the charismatic everyman and Darryl Hannah and John Candy at their best.  But under the comedy and sweetness I have always thought there was a disturbing undertone of extreme pessimism--just what kind of ugly and cruel society do we live in, in which the mermaid Madison's only prospect is that she will be tortured, from which Hanks' character ultimately has to flee, never to see his beloved brother again? (The same dark undertone is even more pronounced, I think, in Ron Howard's next big hit Cocoon, where the old folks willingly escape an earth and families that don't seem to offer them anything anymore.)",Splash

Tom Hanks was fine and the girl was ok (anyone could have done here part but it was ok. no biggie). I did think that this script should have been given to a better director which I thought did a mediocre job. Ron Howard -puke! did you see The Grinch -OH! How Awfully boring!! I would like to see A Beautiful Mind but I found out he did it and so therefore it will probably stink.Anyhow, this plays out like a fairy tale and one to remember, a keeper to buy on videotape and play for the kids or yourself.Even though I thought it should have been way way way better, I will give it a 10/10.",Splash

The cast is well selected, Tom Hanks is one of Hollywood's brightest stars I remember seeing him on television as Kip Wilson from Bosom Buddies and Ned Donnelly from a few episodes of Family Ties. His portrayal of a lonely businessman who falls for a woman with a secret was comical and sweet.Darryl Hannah is lovely and whimsical as the mermaid, she doesn't act like a dumb blonde but rather a curious beauty trying to navigate through a world she's never been in before. The chemistry between her & Hanks is smart & touching. John Candy's break out role as Freddie Bauer Allen's older, bachelor womanizing brother was a laugh a minute great. There's a memorable scene in which Allen, Freddie and Dr. Kornbluth played by the brilliant Eugene Levy make a rescue plan to save Madison. She tells him not to feel guilty about not loving her anymore, He says ""Oh Madison"". ""All the time we were together, you always knew how I was feeling. Can't you tell now? then they kissed. The song Love Came For Me sung by Rita Coolidge during the part where the happy couple swims away together and while the credits rolled was a moving moment.Splash is one of 1984's best films not just for the comedy but also for the romantic fantasy displayed,I'd give it a 6.9/10.",Splash
83,ali-mostaque,Thank you Ron Howard and the others.,10,8 December 2008,"I have of course watched this movie several times. I don't get tired of the jokes, the satire and general comedy. It always seems so fresh to me.It is a light romantic comedy, with a young Tom Hanks, lonely, going through life with mismatched relationships, until by chance he meets a mermaid.........and then the film progresses from there.The acting by the leading characters seems so natural; they are not trying too hard to be slapstick funny, but through the great dialog, direction and timing, they make it a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch. But for the nudity, I am sure this would be enjoyed by all ages, and background.There are some ironic parts, since the movie was made over two decades ago. The speech by the tour guide about the statue of Liberty, and a few other indications in that direction. That Gritty hard commercialized New York could have another side to it.In one sense what is funny is a highly personal issue. For me anyway mermaids and the beauty of Daryl Hannah has special significance. The very first girl I fell in love with looked vaguely like her, back 22 years ago.The message about love and relationships is eternal, and it was done in a very enjoyable way.So thank you again Ron Howard and ALL the others.",Splash

There are many very funny lines in this, most coming from the late great Candy as the Oafish brother. I just wish Candy got more roles of this calibre. Of course Tom Hanks is now a superstar in films like Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and Castaway, but perhaps Daryl Hannah hasn't reached her potential , hopefully she'll have a bit of luck in her film choices in the future.

Every man's (and boy's) fantasy is played out when the beautiful Madison (Hannah), who happens to be a mermaid, comes to shore looking for the man she loves, Allen (Hanks). Hanks and Hannah is a magical match as they are beautiful together. Tom Hanks has a way with comedy and drama and is one of the finest actors of our time. Candy plays the easy-going brother Freddie,who helps Allen realize that he really does love Madison. The movie has action, comedy, suspense, fine acting, a superb cast (even Eugene Levy provides some laughs), and above all the ultimate male fantasy. Women will love this one too though, because it is above all a love story where in the end it is the man who leaves his world behind to join hers. Ron Howard's directorial debut is also one of his more memorable. This film was the forerunner to Hanks' later comedies and romance movies and proved he had unique talent.",Splash

Films like this are a time capsule as they shout they are part of the 1980's period in a way that I don't think any other decade arrogantly declared itself by its display of fashion and peripheries.Splash is more than a reference guide to recreating the 1908's. Beneath the simple romantic comedy there is a real story of fighting exploitation and treating decent people or mermaids as freaks for wonder and exploitation. Taken out of her environment Daryl Hannah successfully re adjusts until a media circus finds a way of using her to sell products and boost their own fame.

Not that we are dating mermaids, but it is a movie that has Alan (Tom Hanks) in a very real situation of been in love with someone who he is trying to figure out who she is but she wont give the answers or really open up.

It's a likable bit of romantic froth, worthy as a step-off point for Tom Hanks and Ron Howard to move on to bigger and better things. I think I saw Viggo Mortensen (from ""Lord of the Rings"" fame) in a bit part. It's in that scene where the scientist with the mustache goes to see Madison in her tank, and is greeted with a big surprise (she is not there). He is accompanied by a few other men, and it looked like the future Aragorn was one of them. I can't be sure of this, because I checked the cast list on the IMDb listing, and his name wasn't there.

95,leovic,Loved the sincerity of everything.,8,4 October 2017,"The premise is ridiculous. And after watching it for the first time recently, the relationship build up of Allen (Tom Hanks) and Madison (Daryl Hannah) seemed a little flimsy in my opinion. But I loved that the cast and the two leads just went for it and did the romance wholeheartedly. And that's what's so strong about this movie other than the comedic performances of John Candy and Eugene Levy is the chemistry of Daryl Hannah and Tom Hanks. They were just so sincere with the relationship they were trying to show.The movie is a fish-out-of-water type romantic comedy. Madison is a mermaid that falls in love with Allen a hopeless romantic that's weirdly apprehensive when it comes to love. And that apprehension brings up the major issue I had with the movie. Initially the relationship between the leads seemed like Madison loved Allen more than Allen did her and for no good reason. And yes, I understand that they built Allen up at the start as hesitant when it came to love. They just didn't show enough to convince that that mattered to his arc. Also, they didn't show enough as to why Madison loved Allen so much. But then later on when the goofs started coming in and with the crisis of the ending act of the movie. I started to believe that Allen did have deeper feelings for Madison. And it did help that Tom Hanks added a knew when to pull back the comedy and bring in the emotion and drama of his character. Also, Daryl Hannah was just so fun to watch as a wide-eyed foreigner but also fun to see her unexplained deep love for Allen. I guess unexplained is a bit much ... maybe contextualized would be better. But to my point of the sincere performances of the leads. It's just so fun to watch them in love with no hint of irony or parody that my current mindset of relationships in film is right now. The movie and the leads performance is just unabashed in it's romanticism. And that made me love the movie. And again John Candy and especially Eugene Levy really brought the comedy to this.All-in-all, I recommend the movie. If you happen to catch on cable like I did, it's not a bad experience.",Splash

From Bloomingdales to the bottom of the sea, this movie constantly finds ways to make you burst out laughing, while also making you burst out in tears! The leading actors and actresses do a remarkable job; some being Tom Hanks as the man in love and Daryl Hannah as the beautiful and hilarious mermaid. I also must say that Daryl Hannah's tail looks stunningly real, with so many details that every time you watch it you notice something new. That can also be said for the entire film! Splash is a movie that, simply put, reaches above and beyond. It is great for all ages, because I am twelve!",Splash
