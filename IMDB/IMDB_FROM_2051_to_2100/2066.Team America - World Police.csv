0,MartinHafer,The folks from South Park bite the hand that fed them....cool.,9,7 July 2011,"I wonder if anyone was offended by this film?! Well, like any production by the South Park team of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the answer is yup... After all, ""Team America"" is loaded with tons of expletives, really dirty puppet sex (funny puppet sex, actually) and it attacks Hollywood's self-appointed elite in a way no other film has. Yes, it will offend...and make folks laugh as long as they don't take it all very seriously.The film begins with Team America and Muslim terrorists blowing up the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe (later the Great Pyramid and the Sphynx also are destroyed)! But, in the process, one of their team members is killed and can only be replaced by one person--an actor! And naturally, the purpose of the rest of the film is having this uncertain actor prove himself. But, despite this being a bit of a cliché, everything else isn't! Yep, what other film would feature an unholy alliance between Kim Jong-Il and the Hollywood leftists?! And in the process, Parker and Stone savagely attack many of the same actors who originally promoted and admired their work. Some of them took it as a joke and enjoyed it, though some hated the film. As for me, I loved seeing these folks attacked so viciously, as normally whatever these folks say is hardly ever confronted or disputed--it's just accepted that they are experts on world affairs! And so, as I said in the summary, they bite the hand that once fed them.I think to love the film you need to have a high tolerance for the cursing, the vomiting (and wow, there is A LOT of barf), the anti AND pro-American imperialist message and the sex. If you will be too offended by this (and the anti Hollywood left message) then don't watch and DON'T let your kids watch it regardless. But, I found that beneath all the crudeness was a refreshing freshness about the film--there ain't nothing like it! I think I also liked it because the film makers seem to attack everyone in their work--right, left and everything in-between. So, while the left is strongly attacked in the film, the right also is to a lesser extent and is often skewered on ""South Park"".By the way, although it is politically incorrect, try switching on the captions when you watch the DVD. Kim Jong-Il's captioning is hilarious, as it is spelled exactly as he talks! Also, watch the special features, as they show you so many wonderful hidden things you could never notice even if you tried repeated viewings--such as the croissants.",Team America - World Police
1,TheLittleSongbird,Extremely rude but often hilarious satire,7,6 February 2010,"Team America:World Police does have its flaws but it is a hilarious and exceptionally crafted satire. It is very easy to be offended by this sort of film, as this film pokes fun at everybody and everything and is not kind about it. And I do admit the plot is a little obvious, some scenes like the vomit sequence are drawn out a bit too much and some(heavy emphasis on this word) of the writing goes overboard. But it is very funny, with some genuinely hysterical moments especially the lampooning of Hollywood stars and works surprisingly well as a satire with clear sardonic wit in places. Technically and visually, this film is exceptional, the backgrounds, puppetry and lighting are all superb and award worthy. The music is also excellent, and there is some great vocal work. Overall, Team America:World Police isn't for everyone, I for one had to see it a few times to completely get what was going on. It is flawed, but it is very well done as a satire. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Team America - World Police
2,SnoopyStyle,Interesting technical exercise with one hilarious character,6,28 September 2014,"Team America takes down terrorists in Paris and destroy most of the landmarks. Carson is killed right after proposing to fellow team member psychologist Lisa. Then team director Spottswoode recruits Broadway actor Gary Johnston to join the team. He goes undercover in Cairo to infiltrate the terrorists. They end up blowing everything once again. Meanwhile Kim Jong Il in North Korea is planning to use WMDs to destroy the world. And various actors from Film Actors Guild decry the destruction from Team America. When terrorists destroy Panama, FAG starts blaming it all on Team America.This is definitely an interesting technical exercise to use marionettes. It's cute but it wears out its uniqueness. The marionettes can't project much emotions. The jokes rattle off in a long string of inappropriateness. It's funny at the start but it feels repetitive. The voice work is also very monotone. Trey Parker and Matt Stone do most of the voices. They sound too similar. I actually love the character Kim Jong Il. It's the only one that consistently gets laughs for me. This is a satire trying to push the envelop but I don't find it funny all the way through. I'm not offended by any of it. Maybe it would be funnier if it was more offensive.",Team America - World Police
3,claudio_carvalho,Hilarious Satire to the Contemporary World,8,11 April 2007,"The North American anti-terrorist force Team America attacks a group of terrorist in Paris. Later, the leader of the organization, Spottswoode, invites the famous Broadway actor Gary Johnston to join his world police and work undercover in Cairo in a terrorist organization and disclose their plan of destroying the world. The Team America destroys the cell of terrorists, but then the Panama Canal is attacked by the criminals as a payback. Gary feels responsible for the death of many innocents and leaves the counter-terrorism organization. When the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong II, joins a group of pacifist actors and actresses with the intention of using weapons of massive destruction, the Team America tries to avoid the destruction of the world.""Team America: World Police"" is a hilarious satire to the contemporary world, most specifically the position and attitudes of the USA as the ""world police"" and of some Hollywood actors and actresses outside the cinema. The very first sequence with Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum and Arc of Triumph being completely destroyed and the Team America celebrating their victory is impressive and extremely funny, holding the attention of the viewer for the rest of the movie. The dialogs, songs and situations are incredible and the DVD is simply fantastic, having one of the best ""making of"" ever, disclosing in details how this film was made. The teams of professionals involved in this production are really composed of creative artists of first-rate. It is amazing to see the details of the scenarios, puppets and puppeteers and how the components have been manufactured. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Team América - Detonando o Mundo"" (""Team America - Blowing the World"")",Team America - World Police
4,lee_eisenberg,"God bless this ""America""",10,4 June 2005,"Anyone who has watched ""South Park"" should know to expect nothing less than pure satire of every group from Trey Parker and Matt Stone. ""Team America: World Police"" takes that to the nth degree. It tells the story of an army of marionettes who go around stopping terrorists from attacking the United States. We eventually learn that the terrorists are being supplied by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, who wants to rule the world. His secret allies are the new-age liberal Film Actors' Guild (F.A.G.), led by the overly pacifist Alec Baldwin.The humor is simply the way that the movie spoofs everyone and everything. Whether showing country/western singers as right-wing wackos, or portraying Hollywood as a bunch of left-wing wackos, nothing is sacred to Trey Parker and Matt Stone. When Kim Jong Il sounds like Cartman from ""South Park"", you know that it's got to be crazy.Other famous people who get mocked include George Clooney, Matt Damon, Danny Glover, Helen Hunt, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Moore, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon. Probably the best song in it was a love song describing what an awful movie ""Pearl Harbor"" was.",Team America - World Police
5,jboothmillard,Team America: World Police,6,21 September 2005,"If you like Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet or Stingray, or you liked South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, then you'll love this new unique mix of puppetry and side splitting comedy. Basically Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park creators) have created a new team of ""heroes"" to save the world from terrorism. The main storyline is that they are fighting against the armies of the evil Kim Jong Il, a puppet obviously. Starring Gary Johnston, Kim Jong Il, Joe, Hans Blix, Carson, Matt Damon, Drunk in Bar, Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Michael Moore, Helen Hunt and Susan Sarandon all played by Trey Parker. Chris, George Clooney, Danny Glover, Ethan Hawke and Matt Damon all played by Matt Stone. Also with puppets Samuel L. Jackson and Alec Baldwin. They didn't pretend to kill all these great actors and actresses because they hate them, they just hate actors and actresses in general and picked some popular ones. The sex and puking scenes are just the best, especially by puppets. It was number 39 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Good!",Team America - World Police
6,Tweekums,An amusingly gung-ho action movie with puppets!,8,8 August 2016,"After a successful operation to prevent a terrorist outrage in Paris, where they destroy the Eifel Tower and the Louvre, defenders of the free world Team America lose one of their members moments after he proposed to the women he loves. This leaves the team a man short so their leader, Spotswood, approaches stage actor Gary Johnston to join the team for their next mission which will require both his acting and linguistic skills to infiltrate a terrorist group in Egypt. The mission is a success but the celebrations are short lived as the terrorists commit an atrocity in Panama in revenge public opinion, especially that of liberal Hollywood actors, turns against Team America and Gary can't go on thinking his hero Alec Baldwin holds him in contempt. While he hits rock bottom the rest of the team go off to tackle the terrorists but are captured by North Korea's Kim Jong-il who is secretly behind the terrorists and is planning to destroy western civilisation. If freedom and democracy are to survive Gary will have to prove he has what it takes.Since this is from the creators of 'South Park' few viewers will be shocked by the fact that it is quite crude at times nor will they be surprised at how funny it is despite the fact that everything is played straight in fact much of the time that is what makes it so funny. The film delightfully sends up Hollywood action movies where Americans defeat bad guys around the world and the liberal sensitivities of many in Hollywood. The use of puppets was a stroke of genius as it just served to make everything even funnier. The puppets are very much of the 'Gerry Anderson' style so people who grew up watching shows like 'Captain Scarlet' and 'Thunderbirds' should love the way they look and move. I enjoyed the way Kim Jong-il was portrayed like the villain in 'The Spy Who Loved Me' feeding Hans Blix to his sharks! Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting plenty of politically incorrect laughs.",Team America - World Police
7,moonspinner55,Exceptionally well-made...but where are the jokes?,5,18 May 2005,"After a group of hit-or-miss terrorist-fighters have decimated the world's favorite tourist spots while trying to kill the bad guys, an actor is recruited into the fold to impersonate a Middle Eastern. He gets the job after being spotted in a hit show called ""Lease"", singing the bouncy ditty ""Everybody Has AIDS"". Trey Parker's knack for writing pithy, vulgar, but catchy and cheery original songs nearly saves ""Team America"". Later, a bloodthirsty world leader croons a ditty about how lonely his life really is while planning to decimate the US. That's a near-perfect touch, staged impeccably and with great good humor. Some may be shocked by the vulgarities in this marionette action-adventure, but anyone familiar with Parker and Matt Stone's ""South Park"" will know what they're in for. These two go out on a limb, but often they don't go far enough. Instead of being unpredictable and maniacal, they keep repeating gags on the same tired themes (gay sex, bodily functions, et al). These jokes aren't really outrageous at all. It's smut, but it isn't funny smut (try self-consciously funny smut). Parker and Stone are their own best audience; too many middling in-jokes have taken the place of real opportunities for wild humor. The picture looks great, and the puppets are incredible (the whole design here is really amazing), but the plot is a throwaway and the voice-work is execrable--most of the puppets sound like the South Park kids, and not one voice seems to correctly match up with its marionette. ** from ****",Team America - World Police
8,Quinoa1984,"an instant cult comedy hit (emphasis on 'cult', won't be for everyone)",7,13 October 2004,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone, at least for what they know as comedians and filmmakers, do their jobs well for their intended audience. The people who will want to see this are likely already fans via South Park, or perhaps by way of Cannibal: the Musical! or BASEketball. And like their past projects, they incorporate everything they can work with (i.e. the most extreme exaggerations imaginable by way of influences of Monty Python, Broadway musicals, Troma, and the presence of celebrities in the media) and take it a step further. By looking at just the idea of having a film where every single speaking or non-speaking role are made by puppets on strings (first parody being Thunderbirds, which luckily doesn't wear off as a novelty but stays fresh through numerous visual gags) brings to question if they're trying to make a big social point about the state of the world, or if they just want to try something new, challenging, and wacky. The latter might be the more rightful argument.I could go into the plot, however there is nothing crucial to divulge. Chiefly, the film takes on the story conventions ingrained in the kinds of summer blockbusters Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer produce (there's even a reference somewhere about Pearl Harbor), involving a team of elite fighters who stop terrorists with WMD's all around the world. But with the emergence of Kim Jong Il the brutal, Elvis-hair dictator, and the Film Actor's Guild (or F.A.G.), they plan to stop the team. While America's now current President and his opponent are left out of the fun, most of what has been up for grabs satirically is in this film. What ensues from start to finish are a string (no pun intended) of gags involving anything and everything to get a laugh out of the obvious, the subtle, the obscene, and the stupid.Parker, Stone, and co-writer Pam Brady, are ambitious with this film, and aside from the sometimes ludicrous nature of the punch lines, the point of the film (while appropriately convoluted by way of the blockbuster genre) isn't lost on me. Is America bad, good, or neutral in its actions as world police officers? The point might be lost on some, though, and some of the gags don't work as well as the best ones. But when the film delivers, it's on par with the boys' best work. The sheer audacity of the production is one that's so original and outrageous that you sometimes might laugh at yourself for laughing. By the time the climax of the film hits in the heart of North Korea, all bets are off. Team America: World Police doesn't try for the kind of dead-pan satire of say Dr. Strangelove. It's more akin to Airplane! That is if it were made by a couple of unhinged, often smart-ass couple of guys as if let loose in the film studio to run rampant. Some jokes may just fly over your head, which is perhaps all the better- it's the kind of film I'll want to see again with a bunch of friends. So, ""terrorists, TERRORIZE THIS!""",Team America - World Police
9,preppy-3,Has its moments...but not enough of them,5,30 October 2004,"A movie done with marionettes. There's a ""Team America""--a group of freedom fighters who use jets, guns, rocket launchers etc. to fight terrorists world wide. They hire an actor (Gary) to join their ranks...but is he ready?This really can't work as a full-length movie. The idea of using marionettes in an action film parody is pretty good--but gets real tiresome after the initial joke wears off. Surprisingly the writers (Matt Stone, Trey Parker) use a by-the-numbers action movie plot and play most of it seriously! There are a few lines that are funny but most of it is dead on serious. Seeing marionettes doing clichéd roles isn't funny...or interesting. It isn't until the very end that the plot goes barreling out of control fast...THEN it's funny!The movie isn't a total bomb. There are three sequences that had me in hysterics: the notorious sex sequence (which is almost worth the price of admission!); a LONG vomit sequence and a VERY bloody massacre at the end. And the songs were all very good...and funny (Sample lyric: ""Team America F*** Yeah!"").Still, I was bored quite a bit and the obvious plot annoyed me. I can honestly only give this a 5. Not even close to being as good as the South Park movie.",Team America - World Police
10,dbborroughs,Wildly uneven comedy that proves you can't make a movie on a time table,5,18 October 2004,"Discussion of the plot is pointless, I mean what can you say about a story that lampoons everything in relating the adventures of a group of good guys who do more damage than the bad guys (like most superhero stories in comics)What I want to say is that this is both the funniest movie of the year and the dullest.The problem here is the pacing, its absolutely awful. Brilliant bits are like oasis in the desert of cliché. Once the joke that the puppets limit what can be done is established the film crawls at a leaden pace through the linking material between the good parts.Don't get me wrong this is hysterically funny at times, but at others you want to reach for the fast forward. Couldn't they have cut this better? Perhaps the battle to get it out for the already announced release date took its toll. It looks and feels like they used every bit of footage they had- except for the puppet sex scene which was cut to get an R rating. (How stupid is that?)The laughs make this worth seeing but do so on video.5 out of 10. (Laughs when the come is 10 out of 10, but the pacing is 1 out of 10 so it becomes a solid 5 out of 10.)",Team America - World Police
11,zardoz-13,"The most original, cutting-edge, non-human, laugh-riot since the claymation classic ""Chicken Run""",10,18 March 2005,"Puppet sex, projectile vomiting, profuse profanity, and piles of B-movie action clichés proliferate in ""South Park"" creator Trey Parker's new marionette movie ""Team America: World Police,"" a demented but inspired politically incorrect satire about global terrorism that ranks as the most original, cutting-edge, non-human, laugh-riot since the claymation classic ""Chicken Run."" Anybody who hated ""South Park"" should be prepared for the worst from this imaginative, superbly-made parody of director Michael Bay's pompous actioneers. The MPAA gave ""Team America"" its richly-deserved R-rating for lots of ""graphic, crude, and sexual humor"" as well as ""violent images and strong language, all involving puppets."" Again, this is a puppet movie! For the record, the parental website Kids-In-Mind counted ""62 F-words and its derivatives, 12 sexual references, nine scatological terms, 59 anatomical terms, 14 mild obscenities, 14 derogatory terms for homosexuals (some are in an ongoing play on words referring to the Film Actors Guild as F.A.G., one derogatory term for African-Americans, six religious profanities, and 15 religious exclamations (1 in French with no translation)."" Although writer/director Trey Parker and ""South Park"" co-scribes Pam Brady and Matt Stone never mention President George W. Bush by name, they ridicule Washington's efforts at thwarting world-wide terrorism, particularly when our heroes demolish more than the terrorists destroy. When they aren't making a mockery of macho Hollywood action movies, Parker, Brady, and Stone lampoon liberal-minded actors who believe they can usher in peace on the basis of their celebrity status. You'll laugh yourself silly at the strikingly life-like puppets of Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Martin Sheen, Sean Penn, and Janeane Garofalo. Last but not least, ""Team America"" skewers filmmaker Michael Moore of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" fame as a suicidal bomber with mustard smeared across his jowls and a hot dog in either hand.""Team America"" chronicles the exploits of an elite ""A-Team'' of commandos armed to the teeth with an arsenal of every conceivable modern weapon. These gung-ho hard cases target terrorists, usually of the stereotypical, bewhiskered, Middle-Eastern, towel-headed variety. During their first face-off in Paris, France, our tyke-sized protagonists gun down several terrorists in a slam-bang, blood-splattered, public street shoot-out. Indeed, when bullets strike these expressive but plastic puppets, they bleed like actors in a live-action opus. (""Team America"" is the closest that anybody has come to matching ""Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson's 1989 blood & gore puppet movie ""Meet the Feebles."") Not only do our heroes decimate the terrorists, they also destroy the Eiffel Tower, the Arch of Triumph and the Louvre in a hilarious domino effect that sends one structure toppling over to wipe out another and another. Making the world safe from terrorists, however, takes a toll on the team when one of them takes a bullet in the back from a terrorist playing possum in a water fountain. After successfully completing their mission and destroying French landmarks in the process, our heroes return to their home base, cleverly concealed in historic Mount Rushmore. Team America's master computer is called I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. Team America leader, Spottswoode (voice of Trey Parker), decides to adopt a different strategy, so he persuades a ""top gun"" Broadway actor named Gary Johnston (voice of Parker), who is appearing in the play ""Lease,"" to go undercover and learn what the terrorists are planning next. Martial arts expert Chris doesn't like Gary because Gary is an actor and Chris was raped by the cast of ""Cats."" In ""Team America,"" Gary Johnston is furnished a hammer in case he is required to take his own life. Gary undergoes plastic surgery so he will blend in with the bad guys. Essentially, they put boot polish on his face and attach turfs of hair to his cheeks. Disguised as an Arab, Gary strolls into a café in Cairo where he asks the obvious question: ""Anybody know of any terrorist attacks coming up soon?"" and nearly gets his little plastic buttocks blown off. Again, our reckless heroes rush to Gary's rescue, mow down the trigger-happy bad guys, and accidentally destroy the Sphinx and the Pyramids. Eventually, the biggest and most despicable villain of them all marches forward in the pot-bellied shape of a bespectacled Kim Jong II. Clearly, Parker and company have modeled him on the standard James Bond villain. The diabolical North Korean dictator has secretly amassed a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and has hoodwinked Alec Baldwin and a number of other movie celebrities into helping him achieve his dastardly goal. At one point, Jong serves up U.N. Weapons Inspector Hans Blix as lunch for his sharks! Among the celebrities, Matt Damon is portrayed as too dumb to say anything except his own name (which he repeats over and over).While most filmmakers resort to the latest technology to make their movies, director Trey Parker steps back in time to revive old-fashioned, hand-manipulated marionettes. Yes, when these bubble-headed marionettes walk, you can see the strings holding them up, and that is part of the charm of ""Team America."" Parker got the idea when he saw the vintage 1960's British TV series ""Thunderbirds"" which utilized an all puppet cast. Although Parker relies on ancient technology, he and his crew spent major bucks to recreate in painstaking detail the scaled down, one-third life-like locales. For example, if you peer closely at the Paris sequence, you may notice that the French cobblestones resemble croissants.Altogether, ""Team America"" succeeds first as a pungent political satire, second as a spoof of Michael Bay movies like ""Pearl Harbor,"" and third as a truly innovative puppet movie. The puppetry is first-rate, and the production values are dazzling. Again, the attention to detail for an essentially silly movie like this goes far beyond what you'd expect. Lenser Bill Pope of ""The Matrix"" shoots the entire film as if he were photographing a live action epic. Only time will tell whether this controversial comedy will emerge as the single most important film of our time to dissect the guidance of Washington's war against terrorism.",Team America - World Police
12,Boba_Fett1138,Cruel but hilarious.,8,3 June 2005,"Man, this movie its humor was cruel. Even crueler than ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"". I still can't understand how Trey Parker and Matt Stone ever got away with this. It's hilarious for most parts but still they also crosses the border a times in my opinion.First of all this movie makes a perfect political statement. It shows lot's of stereotypes and perfectly spoofs the American patriotism and naivety. It doesn't only make a political statement but also an 'Hollywood-statement', as the movie also makes fun of action movies and in particular Jerry Bruckheimer productions. But even worser off are actors in the movie, actors like Matt Damon, Samuel L. Jackson, Helen Hunt, Sean Penn, Martin Sheen etc and F.A.G. leader Alec Baldwin. Still the movie's statement and message isn't as powerful as for instance ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" was.Obviously this movie can be seen as one huge protest against the Bush-administration which makes it a peculiar fact that Bush isn't a even a character, or as a matter of fact, he isn't even mentioned but yet they find it appropriate to spoof Hans Blix? Don't get me wrong, the Hans Blix scene's were absolutely hilarious but it's just a bit peculiar and maybe even coward by Parker and Stone to do so.Spectacular was the action of this movie, with over-the-top slow-motion and totally hilarious fist-fights. Just like ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" the movie looks extremely doltish (no phun intended) but the movie itself is absolutely brilliant and extremely well made and constructed, also helped by the extremely over-the-top and brilliant musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams, who perfectly spoofs his own work and that of his Media Ventures colleagues.The movie mostly is extremely cruel but very hilarious. Still at moments the movie really pushes it and simply goes too far in its humor and graphics. The story is nothing memorable and to be honest the villains were disappointing. Still the movie deserves all the praise it has gotten, for the movie really works well in most parts, both as a political statement as well as a comedy-movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Team America - World Police
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The way to do parody,8,6 June 2008,"I don't quite know why I put off watching this for so long... I think I had kind of gotten used to Bigger, Longer and Uncut and I haven't seen an episode of the show for a while... and I guess I just forgot how funny Trey and Matt are. Call them childish, call them crude, call them offensive(in fact, call them those three things to their faces and they'll probably reply ""And proud of it!"")... they are satirists, and pretty darn good ones, and no one is spared here. Apart from the humor and in some ways, the tone(which, just like the writing, is spot-on for the genre), this is radically different from South Park, movie and series alike. This is a huge brainless Hollywood action film... done with dolls. It would probably even satisfy viewers just going to see that, and it's on a grand scale. Nothing like this has been seen before... in more ways than one. The plot is marvelous, and it keeps your interest, developing nicely throughout. The pacing is great, if it is more fast than even. You can tell that neither of the writer/directors have done this sort of thing before. Nevertheless, they pulled off such giant stunts, effects and explosions. The score is wonderfully done, and the lyrics are simply hilarious. The animation is incredible, and it works really well. Of course, it's played for laughs, too, much of it. Parker and Stone have a lot of fun with the shortcomings of the puppets. The noteworthy thing is how they take the consequence, and, instead of covering it up, they not only show it, but dwell on it... parade it. Genuine effort is made to draw attention to it. They didn't go the same route here as last time around... what they do here is effective as well, though. The references and spoofs are well-done. The humor is spectacular when at its best, meaning mostly. For better or for worse, a considerable amount is what you'd expect. As usual, they don't just go towards the line, or to it... they rush over the line, leaving censors and large groups of people appalled. It made me laugh, if not entirely invariably, and not everything pays off. Of course, some of it just makes one cringe. That, in addition to the wide, decided lack of seriousness are among the few things bringing it down from a perfect rating. However, the big speech near the end by one character is, for my money, whilst definitely verbally crude, also true... excellently done. It's a magnificent(and desperately needed) send-up of all those Bruckheimer/Bay action flicks. It's got its finger on the pulse. Say what you will, it's awfully hard to miss the commentary and truth this movie offers. The DVD features trailers, outtakes, deleted scenes, animated story-boards and a series of interviews with the two. I recommend this to everyone who can take it, and anyone who enjoys what Matt Stone and Trey Parker deliver. Give this a chance. I did, and I since went ahead and bought it. 8/10",Team America - World Police
14,anaconda-40658,Puppet Sex!,7,16 December 2015,"Team America: World Police (2004): Dir: Trey Parker, Matt Stone / Voices: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Kristen Miller, Daran Norris, Skyler Stone: Vulgar and distasteful computer generated string puppet action film about a team of fighters who destroy terrorism. They seem to be a metaphor for the senseless attack on Iran. They destroy every important landmark they come across and seek a stage actor to disguise himself as a terrorist and gather information. They find him performing a musical called Everybody Has A.I.D.S. With his help they confront a terrorist enemy who assembles members of the Screen Actors guild for support. Totally offensive yet detailed film directed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park. Some characters are broad while others are types. Parker and Stone voice many of the puppet characters including actor Gary and terrorist villains. Kristen Miller voices agent Lisa who falls for Gary, and Daran Norris voices the agency head who seeks Gary out. Skyler Stone voices Chris who confesses why his attitude is so bad. Numerous celebrities are maimed in response towards publicity stunts. Jokes include two naked puppets engaging in various sexual positions, and an extended puking scene. While the film is offensive, it also strives for creativity while attacking media bullshit. The puppets are a hoot within all the turmoil. Score: 7 / 10",Team America - World Police
15,FlashCallahan,Doesn't really pull the right strings.....,6,25 September 2016,"Team America are an international police force dedicated to maintaining global stability. Learning that power hungry dictator Kim Jong Il is out to destroy the world, the team recruits Broadway star Gary Johnston to go undercover. With the help of Team America, Gary manages to slip into an arms dealer's hideout to uncover the plan to destroy the world. Will Team America be able to save the world, and stop the film actors guild, led by the greatest living actor......Alec Baldwin.As talented as Parker and Stone are, they are getting a bit old hat now. Twenty years ago, South Park was a breath of fresh air, just on the right side of being too edgy, and the awful animation only added to the charm of the programme.Then the film was released, and it ran out of steam very, very quickly.And this film sniffers the same fate.Trying to be controversial is one thing, and with today's politically correct morons leading Hollywood, it's wonderful that they try to go all out with their bawdy humour. But this is the problem, the humour leaves the film just as Gary enters the limo for the first time, and it never returns for the remainder of the film. So what we are left with is a pretty boring action film with the novelty of it being cast entirely by puppets, and again, the novelty quickly wears off, as you are left with nothing but a group of highly unlikable characters causing more harm than the actual terrorists depicted in this.As expected, the focus of the humour is all race related, and giving characters who are not American, very silly accents to make the patriotic members of the audience laugh because someone pronounces words using the letter W instead of the letter L.Hilarious.It's not very good, and time hasn't been kind to the film, as the humour feels more ancient than that of seventies British sitcoms.",Team America - World Police
16,zetes,Half the material has already been seen in South Park; this needed to be funnier,6,24 October 2004,"I'm a big fan of Matt and Trey, but this is a big misfire. Oh, it has its moments, to be sure, but the satire is weak and the jokes come slowly. I'm in doubt that so many others have been in theaters where people were laughing so hard they couldn't hear the movie. I can't imagine anyone laughing that hard at this. The main problem is that, as a parody of big budget action flicks, it sticks too close to the formula. I could almost forget I was at a comedy from the creators of South Park. Instead, I was watching a Michael Bay movie. Plus, there isn't anything in this movie that the guys haven't already done on South Park, and, as a SP devotee, this movie doesn't feel as fresh as it should. They throw us an early bone where Kim Jong Il quotes Eric Cartman. That's supposed to produce a chuckle in any audience member who watches SP. But then the Michael Moore characterization is identical to Rob Reiner's appearance at the end of the 7th season. Even one of the movie's songs was used in an episode before ('Montage' from one of the best episodes, Asspen). They've made fun of country music's racist appeals and exploitation of 9/11 before. And the whole d*cks vs. p*ssies thing was the basis for an entire episode. The political satire is way off. I don't think Matt and Trey really meant to be as acidic as they come off towards the celebrity activists who are lampooned in the movie. They're just jokesters, after all, and they've had some really funny jokes at the expense of celebrities in the past, and even killed them before on their show. The Michael Moore jokes were the cheapest. They come off like they subscribe to the philosophy of Ann Coulter and the like who think liberals are more of a threat to American safety than terrorists. I really don't think they meant that, but the dim-witted teenage market that the movie appeals to is so conservative now that the satire is in danger of being taken seriously. I don't like to think about that. Okay, so I've been pretty negative, but, truthfully, some stuff does work. In particular, the puppet sex scene is hilarious (and I think I know what they cut to get an R rating), and the song about the movie Pearl Harbor was the highlight of the movie, and almost made it worth seeing ('I guess Pearl Harbor sucked just a little bit more than I miss you'). 6/10.",Team America - World Police
17,siderite,"South Park satire in Thunderbirds style, but ultimately boring",7,29 November 2014,"I liked the movie, but I was not impressed by it. At first the puppet animations and occasional singing threw me off, but then I got into the spirit of things. After all, South Park is the same, focusing on the story and funny satire, rather than on good animation. The problem is that the jokes were not that funny and the ideas were few. This is something that I really cannot understand, since every SP episode is the combination of at least two satires playing together, and often more, and they last for 20 minutes. How can a movie made by the same guys (and in this category I place the South Park movie, as well) be less in one hour and a half?The main plot is a satire on the Hollywood way of portraying global politics, from ridiculous action movies that glorify violence to end violence and the American spirit against the world to actor associations talking about peace and external policy without getting any of it. The film makes fun of several movies, but just scene gags, really, then goes into the politically incorrect humor with puppet sex scenes and taking shots at celebrity actors. Team America, a Thunderbirds rip off, go all around the world saving the world from terrorists and in the process destroying the Eiffel tower, the Arc of Triumph, the Louvre, the Sphynx, etc, congratulating themselves for a job well done afterwards. That was really funny. However all the jokes coming after were weaker. They should not have started with their best gag. Kim Jong-il is the villain and by far the funniest character, being a combination of Cartman and Tuong Lu Kim, the Chinese character that debuted in the ""Jared has Aides"" South Park episode. Very fitting, indeed.Bottom line: the movie felt like a South Park episode, which was great, but it lasted for an hour and a half. During that time I would have watched and enjoyed four SP episodes, so it all felt watered down. I really wanted to enjoy it, but at times all I felt was the need to fast forward.",Team America - World Police
18,StevePulaski,Two talented animators being themselves through marionettes,9,22 February 2011,"Offend, offend, offend. Offend who? Offend what? Offend everybody! Offend, offend, offend! That's the goal in any Trey Parker/Matt Stone movie. Got a religious fanatic angry? Got the Catholic Church on your back? Aggravate of the Muslim Prophet recently? YES! Jackpot! We've got people angry. Team America: World Police may look like a film in style to Rescue Heroes, but the R rating and ""From the creators of South Park"" message at the bottom of the theatrical poster should make any parent rethink. This is NOT a kids film at all.Team America is a different film that really hasn't been spoke about too much since it's 2004 release which is a damn shame. I watched a lot of features on the DVD of this movie and these people put a lot of effort into this film. I've reviewed a lot of films, and I know making a film is not something that isn't done in a day, but this film's attention to detail is exquisite. Just to see so many people (including The Chiodo Brothers, the masterminds behind Killer Klowns From Outer Space) work on this film, and pour so much effort into every marionette is just an all out shock.Have you ever heard of a dirty puppet show? Not the kind put on in your parent's basement 3am drunk, but a movie done with all marionettes that comes off as a dirty film? I've never heard of that happening before. Great! A unique concept. Finally, something quirky and just all around ridiculous. My kind of taste exactly. Puppets dancing, having sex, shooting and killing other puppets, terrorist puppets, Kim Jong puppets, and puppets voiced by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I love that.The plot was the least of my concerns, the visuals were the thing that made the film. Gary (Trey Parker) is a Broadway actor who is called to duty to help the Team America police squad arrest Kim Jong IL for his acts of terrorism. The plot may sound serious, but it is depicted as a very humorous satire against common action clichés and American Politics.Team America: World Police looks like something a four year old kid would do with a LEGO set, but it's so much more than what it is said to be. If I tried saying ""You need to check out this film. It's called Team America, and it's about these police officers trying to take down Kim Jong IL. Oh, and it's done with marionettes."" People would get interested until I say the last sentence. All I can say is DO NOT take this movie as a serious film. It's a comedic film that is exquisite in the field of attention to detail, and is more exciting than some would believe.I tend to enjoy some movies too much, this may be the case. But I'm in no way exaggerating the way I feel about Team America. If I ever get the great opportunity to meet Parker/Stone, while everybody will be standing in line waiting for them to autograph one of their pieces of South Park merchandise, I'll be the dope standing there with a copy of this DVD in my hand.Starring: Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

But everyone told me that this was a very funny film so I was very curious on what it would be like to see the sense of humor of Matt Stone. I'm going to be honest, I laughed, pretty damn hard. I loved most of the sequences and wouldn't mind buying this film. To those who didn't get a kick out of at least one scene, especially ""I'm so Ronrey"", I feel for sad for you that you can't enjoy a silly movie.The only complaint I have is that puppet sex scene, my image of pure Barbie and Ken is ruined!

20,MovieAddict2016,The first five or ten minutes had me falling out of my seat in laughter.,9,29 April 2005,"The first five or ten minutes of ""Team America: World Police"" had me falling out of my seat in laughter. Tears were streaming down my face and I couldn't stop. It opens with an attack on terrorists in France, a clear parody of the overzealous American politics of the time; ending with Paris being destroyed and the Team America crew naively praising themselves whilst the natives of the area watch their houses burn to the ground.The best part of this sequence has to be the silly, dramatic music that plays when the camera zooms in on Osama Bin Laden - carrying a nuclear missile around in a case in central Paris, making an exchange with men in turbans. It's a hilarious parody of the stereotypes we label people with, including the nearby French (all wearing their hats, walking poodles, with French music in the background).Then there's the part where the female Team America member bombs the Louvre, destroying the Mona Lisa therein. I just couldn't stop laughing. It was almost embarrassing, because no one else in the theater was.After that, the film sort of suffers. ""AIDS"" is a song that is alright but lacks the controversy of ""Uncle F--ka"" from ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut."" It's not quite as absurd or funny but manages to be entertaining and silly enough. It just seems like Matt and Trey are trying a bit too hard to follow-up ""Uncle"" with another raunchy song, and it's not quite as successful.The whole puppet angle is funny at first but wears thin quick. Thankfully Matt and Trey realize this and move on to other material.To be honest for the rest of the duration of the movie I didn't laugh a whole lot. There were a few scenes that were hilarious, but long segments where I wasn't even chuckling; not a good sign, really.However, the film as a whole consistently amused me, even when I wasn't guffawing. It's interesting to note that the critics who loved ""South Park"" are slamming this, and I do think it has a great deal to do with the fact that Trey and Matt are bashing liberals AND conservatives, something rare in a Hollywood film. They poke fun at Sean Penn, Michael Moore, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Susan Sarandon, and others. It's not always as funny as it is refreshing. It's not every day you see Sean Penn so mercilessly rampaged in a movie starring a group of puppets controlled by strings.""Team America"" isn't up to par with ""South Park: B, L & U"" and isn't consistently laugh-out-loud funny, but it IS consistently amusing and nice to see everyone being targeted instead of the select few. I would recommend this to anyone who can savor some sharp political satire. And puppet sex.",Team America - World Police

22,Buddy-51,might have been good if it were funny,4,8 February 2006,"An animated film featuring marionettes rather than cel drawings and computer-generated graphics, ""Team America: World Police"" is that rare movie satire that leans Right rather than Left in its politics - although the sheer vulgarity of much of the imagery and dialogue may make it as detestable to conservatives as it is to liberals. In a way, I have to admire a film that isn't afraid to offend people on either side of the political spectrum, but ""Team America"" simply isn't a very good film, offering little in the way of intelligent satire or pointed humor.Written by Trey Parker, Pam Brady and Matt Stone, and directed by Parker, ""Team America: World Police"" involves a group of highly trained youngsters who battle the forces of global terrorism in the name of the good old U S of A. Gary Johnston is a highly successful Broadway actor whom the organization recruits to go undercover and infiltrate terrorist cells in the Middle East.The makers of ""Team America"" certainly show guts in being willing to exploit this sensitive subject for comic purposes, but they really go over the top in portraying Leftist Hollywood celebrities such as Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, Matt Damon, Tim Robbins, George Clooney, Helen Hunt, Danny Glover, Ethan Hawke, Susan Sarandon and others as actually being on the side of the terrorists. Heck, they even have Michael Moore blowing up a building as a suicide bomber. It's one thing to attack these people for their politics, but it's quite another to portray them as sympathetic to mass murderers. It also makes for lousy satire because it lacks the truth and precision satire needs to be truly effective. It would be no less wrong if a liberal filmmaker were to do the same with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and others. The targets also seem lightweight and skewed. Why not go after the politicians who actually create and implement the policies that directly relate to global terrorism rather than a bunch of mouthy celebrities who really have little effect on what goes on in the world? Still, this might have been palatable if the film at least had managed to be funny, but ""Team America"" really doesn't provide much in the laugh department. The romantic relationships between the main characters are trite and silly, and the voice-over imitations of the real-life characters are poor in the extreme. I guess this film works if you have an interest in incredibly graphic puppet sex, marionette projectile vomiting and the gruesome dismemberment and killing of some of filmdom's most famous celebrities. Otherwise, I can't see much reason for watching it.The Right might still manage to get an effective satire together someday. But ""Team America"" sure isn't it.",Team America - World Police
23,thesar-2,Is It Still 2004?,9,29 September 2013,"Previously, like four weeks ago, I had to revisit one of my all-time favorite comedies, because, well, it felt so relevant all over again. So much so, that the term – and thank God for this – ""World Police"" was thrown around the media relentlessly in regards toSyria.Just as that – also, thank God it didn't pan out – was all heating up, the words ""World Police"" popped in my head and so I popped in Team America: World Police.This was probably only my third or fourth time seeing it and the first since probably 2006. It has not aged. In fact, if anything, it felt like it was made today. Sure, the target of the Parker/Stone boys was George Bush Jr. (amongst many others,) but our government seems to continue to think we are the ""World Police."" So sad.I'd say that was my final word on politics, but that's what this whole movie is about. And it was a damn near perfect satire. Over-the-top hilarious, deadpanned responses from, ah-hem, puppets and the so much detail was put in, including the backgrounds, it was absolutely genius. Hell, even the facial expressions – if you could get those from puppets, and they did – were priceless.After inadvertently, though this appears like it happens a lot, destroying Paris in order to protect it, the special unit force: Team America (Fvck Yeah!) loses one member and this leads them to recruit an actor to find/fight more terrorists.Reluctantly and with side-splitting results, he agrees and the story centers on him and thwarting an attack by the North Koreans.I totally only gave you the very basic premise there, leaving out the hundreds, if not over a thousand gags throughout. The (South Park) writers/creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, go after everyone: left, right, moderates, activists, the media, the enemy, the allies, gays, Matt Day-mon and even people with AIDS, just to name a minute few.If you're the slightest bit uncomfortable with just one of those mentioned parties above, PLEASE don't watch this movie. Well, I guess you could, but it's doubtful any of this would open your mind to the Parker/Stone sense of humor. You might want to start soft, such as The Simpsons, then maybe work your way towards Family Guy and American Dad, with one stop at South Park before entering Team America: World Police.Beyond the humor, and believe me, I don't have room in this review to name all my favorite gags and lines, there's outrageously hilarious songs and a sad, sad message on how true the bulk of this is, hence the term: satire. But, they nail America's policies and attitudes perfectly in 2004and I guess, since then.One of my all-time favorite comedies, Team America: World Police, is recommended (again to only open-minded folk) and is perfect for those trying to see how the rest of the world views us.They nailed it. So to speak.Side Note: Just as this movie came out, a coworker and I had seen this movie – separately, but right before we were going to go into another mindless, stressful, boring, and irritating meeting with a boss that hadn't the slightest clue on what our job was or how to handle a meeting, I slid a hammer, I had specifically brought in for this sight gag, across his desk and said: ""Here, you might need this."" He literally could not stop laughing. Rightfully so; it fit in the movie as it did with the meeting we were about to head into. (Many days later, I had forgotten to take it home and my boss casually saw it in my drawer. She asked me what it was for, and I laughed it off with some lame story she seemed to buy or didn't care.)",Team America - World Police
24,cherold,got tired of waiting for something funny,4,26 May 2006,"Parker and Stone always seem to create things for their own amusement. If other people find it funny, great, if others don't, well, they're still amused. Sometimes this results in something brilliant like South Park (back when it was funny), other times it results in South Park (now that it's painfully unfunny).I made it through about half an hour of Team America: World Police, hoping something funny would happen, but I couldn't take it. Basically they have just taking a generic action movie and done it with marionettes, which really is not inherently funny, although apparently Parker and Stone think it is. I've read elsewhere that there is some funny stuff in the movie, but if you watch a comedy and laugh mildly three times in half an hour it's hard to keep going.I was curious about the politics of the movie, which has been criticized, at least by some people I know, as an attack on liberals. It did make fun of liberals, but it also shows the good guys destroy Paris to destroy a handful of terrorists, so based on the first half hour it's making fun of everyone. But it's a movie made as though it's right wing; I don't think Parker and Stone had a real political agenda, I think they just thought it would be really funny to make a really right-wing, hyper patriotic movie. Too bad they were wrong.",Team America - World Police

26,paul2001sw-1,As expected: crude and funny,7,2 October 2008,"'Team America: World Police' is Trey Parker's follow up to the South Park movie, and in similar vein: a satire on world politics that also manages to spoof a genre of traditional movie making (in his previous film, the musical; in this one, the action movie). As before, the humour is very crude, in places outrageously funny but in others just painful. One difference, however, lies in the production values: although a film featuring Thunderbirds-style puppets might be thought of as the perfect partner to South Park's low-quality animation, in fact this is a slick, big-budget film where any apparent artlessness is part of the aesthetic. Personally, the songs were the funniest thing in South Park and they're not as good here; and while the spoofing is good, the satire is again limited by Parker's habit of hitting at every target - if one asks the question which side is he really on, the only answer on this evidence is that he doesn't really care. Nonetheless, I defy anyone to watch this film without finding places to laugh.",Team America - World Police
27,bowmanblue,You don't have to love South Park to like this (but it helps),10,25 October 2014,"'Team America: World Police' comes from the creators of the (somewhat irreverent) TV show South Park. Therefore, if you don't know, expect strong language, adult humour and plenty of poking fun at celebrities. Just like South Park, Team America can easily be dismissed as silly, vulgar and pandering to the lowest common denominator. However, just like South Park, nothing can be further from the truth.South Park's genius is that it sees the adult world through the eyes of innocent children. Team America uses - pretty obvious - puppets to show us the dilemmas faced with international terrorism. It's interesting to note that those with 'far right' political leanings claim that the film is too 'liberal and left wing.' However, those with left-wing leanings claim that it's too right wing. The answer is that it's both. It doesn't really promote one side over the other. It deliberately shows how both arguments are right and they're both also wrong.Team America is about just that - a (not particularly secret) branch of the American military who save the world from those who want to bomb us helpless innocent civilian. However, by repeatedly saving the day, they also annoy everyone by blowing up everywhere they go while they kill the bad guys. Here we have the dilemma: should the ends justify the means? To find out, you really have to watch it and make your own mind up. Yes, it is vulgar, stupid and crude, but it's also funny, intelligent and thought-provoking. It is a rare breed, juggling everything from vomit-jokes to political satire. But, seeing as it came from those who do that sort of thing every week with South Park, you would expect nothing less.You do need a decent sense of humour to watch this. It's not one for the easily offended. Or Matt Damon.",Team America - World Police
28,dromasca,best politically incorrect puppets movie ever,9,17 August 2005,"'Team America' is a breeze of freshness in a genre that seemed deeply dormant or plainly dead, since the Muppets movies back in the 80s. Also, it's the first serious comical treatment - if I may say so - that the war on terror gets, whatever you believe this means.Nobody gets clean out of the impertinent treatment of the script writers. Not the valiant American team policing the world and fighting for democracy, not the various brands of terrorists and communist dictators, and especially not the Hollywood branded liberal peace movement. Every and category of those, and more have full reasons to get angry at this film, but the viewer is the one who gets happy, with a cynical but sincere treatment of todays world and its assembly of coocoos.

31,ironhorse_iv,America!!! F*** Yeah! Team America is funny all the way!,7,5 July 2014,"This movie is so amazing hilarious. The world needs more Marionette movies like this. I haven't saw many like this, before and many like this, after. The script for this film was actually Plan B from Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park, television fame in making a marionette movie. Their first idea was filming a 2004's The Day After Tomorrow or 1998's Armageddon, environment type movie with the puppets. Since, they couldn't secure the rights to the 'Day After Tomorrow' script. They fought for the remake of 1960's Thunderbirds puppet television show, script, only to get turn down when they found out that the studio that got it, wanted it to film it in live action. While the script did go on, to become a live action film, release in 2004 with Bill Paxton in the main role and a different director. It was deeply disappointing. Matt Stone & Trey Parker would use their notes for their Thunderbirds film, and rewrite it as Team America: World Police. Indeed, they really wanted to make a marionette movie. I really dig the puppet work, because a lot of hard work, went into it. The film had a troubled time in production, with various problems regarding the marionettes, as well as the scheduling extremes of having the film come out in time. I give the movie props to how detail the sets, were, and the puppets being used. It felt like we did come into their world. Household objects were used as props in order. It's fun looking for these items as Easter eggs throughout the film. Honestly, the movie wouldn't had work, if it wasn't done by puppets. The puppets really gives the film, its unique comedic look, and style. It's funny, watching the puppet move slightly odd. It is fun to watch them get killed off in outrageous deaths or trying to perform actions scenes. It's shocking to even, see puppets having a sex scene. The version of this scene in the uncut unrated DVD version is much more graphic and much longer. While, it's play for laughs, it's pretty pornographic. What made the movie, even better is the sociopolitical comedy film about United States political position about trying to police the world, post 9/11. No historic landmark is spared in their quest to take out potential threats to the United States. You can really see the tongue in cheek nature of being over-patriotism, while also see the over the top pacifists society of America. The film is an also a satire of big-budget action films, using clichés and stereotypes to get through the humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States at the time. Team America focuses on a fictional team of political paramilitary policemen known as ""Team America: World Police,"" who hired an Broadway actor, Gary Johnston (Voiced by Trey Parker) get inside information on the next terrorist attack, that is being plot by Kim Jong-il (Also voiced By Trey Parker). The supporting voice work by Kristen Miller, Matt Stone, Daran Norris and others were all great in their roles. The film also boasts the occasional musical number, from a 'Rent' musical spoof of 'Everybody got AIDS' to 'I'm so roney' sung by Kim Jong Il about how lonely it is to be an evil dictator. The main theme song is pretty damn, catchy. 2001's Pearl Harbor film by Michael Bay also gets it pretty hard as there's a whole song pretty much detailing why it sucks Yes, the film is very controversy. The film has racist stereotypes, sexual derogatory words, some gross potty humor, and constant profanity. The filmmakers had to fight with the Motion Picture Association of America for Rated R, after getting NC-17 rating, a number of times. The film was recut by a few seconds and rated R. It's really hard to think that this film is NC-17. I saw worst animation type movies than this, get PG like 1986's, Howard the Duck. This movie was at less, watchable. This R-Rating movie isn't for children, so don't get confused by the animations and decide to let small children, watch the film. Still, the film had a really good message toward adults. There is an amazing speech in the end that all comedy and satire, but really, that speech still is valid to what's going on with the world. Like South Park, there are plenty of celebrity caricatures here, that can make you, laugh your head off. My favorite had to be the Matt Damon puppet. Parker and Stone had a particular beef with Michael Moore and took it out on his character due to 1999's Bowling for Columbine documentary in which it seems like Moore made them in favor of his position when they weren't. The only celebrity that took really offend on his portrayal in the film had to be Sean Penn, who took the film as an insult to helping out war torn countries. While, I'm a huge fan of his work, I did think Sean Penn took the movie, too serious. Other celebrities just ignored it, or laugh it off, but Sean Penn really made headlines with this feud against the movie. It only help gather free promoting to go, see the film to the normal audience member. Americans need to be able to laugh at themselves and I found it to be, a very smart comedy.

35,johnnyboyz,"Unrelenting in its ability to play up to contemporary politics, Parker and Stone's spoof on all things that make America ""great"" is as damning as it is funny.",7,7 January 2011,"Team America: World Police opens in a similar vein to that of the South Park film from five years earlier; those crafty, playful, devilish little animators turned surprisingly apt film-makers Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker beginning with a puppet show within a puppet show; a badly done, poorly executed display of characters on strings attempting to walk across the simplest of sets but doing so crassly. We pull back, the film then revealing a functioning and workable enough little set complete with puppets on strings. The opening recalls that of the establishing shot of the mountain peak in the South Park film of 1999; a composition which, in any other film, animated or otherwise, would have looked majestic in all its natural beauty; there, seemingly pasted together with little more than some blue, green and white card. The opening set the shameless, but reigned in, tone for the film; a real disregard on behalf of Stone and Parker linked to any sort of issues or problems you might have with levels of competence in the piece. Team America: World Police is no different; an up-front and stark tackling of the contemporary politics which dominate our global climate; a brutally effective, blackly comic film which is unashamed and forthright in its study but wonderful anyhow.The film covers the pratfalls and misadventures of a young man whom joins a small, elite group of American warmongers operating out of an isolated island base. The reason for his joining comes in the form of the the group of five tragically being cut down to four, when one of them is brutally gunned down by Middle Eastern insurgents in the aftermath of a Parisian gunfight. The Americans, in the form of blonde siren Lisa (Miller) and the deceased Carson (co-director Parker), hilariously have their plight granted priority screen time so that their romantic issues linked to marriage and death may be melodramatically dealt with over that of the plight of the French, whom have just had half their capital eradicated through the gunfight. Following this, the elderly and wheelchair bound leader of the troupe in Spottswoode (Norris) rectifies the situation by hiring the film's protagonist; a Broadway actor named Gary (Parker, again). The other Team America members are: Sarah (Moyo), supposedly harbouring psychic powers; aggressive young alpha-male caricature Chris; the more reserved Joe, whom harbours his own secret feelings towards Lisa; with each of them exercising specific skills across a range of specific fields. The base is overseen by a dopey sounding super-computer named I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. (Hendrie). Things are about to get tough for the Team America crew, as, many miles away, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il plots global Armageddon; his castle shrouded in gloom; the skies above made up of a blood red hue and his patience with most things erroneously thin. Gary's acting qualities are perfect for an inside job the team have in mind, their attempts at Middle-Eastifying Gary and deluded beliefs that they have done a thorough job on transforming his facial build and appearance exemplifying a distinct arrogance linked to how ill-informed they actually are on those of whom they fight. The plan requires them to up and off to Egypt to attempt to foil terrorist activity, however attainable.The piece is a clear and carefully aimed attack directed solely at The Unites State's foreign policy, specifically, the idea that other nations greatly suffer as a result of (Team) America's enforcing of these ideas and the enthusiasm in trying to promote these ideas which comes with it. Take, for example, the instance during which a terror attack is foiled in one country through their involvement with another one (whom was initially totally uninvolved) consequently dragged into the mire. Such a sequence goes on to brutally encapsulate the true-to-life situation of how America's actions can affect those from other countries and how they can fall victim to the war on terror: specifically, those in The United Nations whom uncover trouble whilst helping maintain the occupation of certain Middle Eastern nations. In another scene, The Team sense blood as they chase down their terrorist targets; the fact a friendly directly in the firing line and they ought to be aware that there is casually ignored as the kill nears and information which would reveal important truths ignored. The wading on in gung-ho, given the opportunity's there, scathingly capturing degrees of truth linked to real life events further linked to particular American attitudes in the heat of the war-zone.Team America: World Police is a blackly comic, thoroughly confrontative piece on a war of the times; a 21st Century equivalent to what Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove was to The Cold War, a Thunderbirds-come-Hollywood blockbuster spoof equivalent of one of those old funny-shorts you'd get in which goose-stepping Nazi soldiers during grandeur political parades were played in normal time and then in mocking reverse motion, before flicking back again. Here, The War on Terror is observed as a thing of absurdity or ridiculousness; the idea that a group of seemingly accomplished individuals from a first world country, led by an elderly suave man with a clouded mind, can make a difference by doing what they do and getting involved at every which way possible. The whole thing is exemplified very early on during a deliberately poorly choreographed fist fight between the two warring sides in a nondescript Muslim and the All American trooper; a fight between two factions reduced to petty squabbling and frenzied thrashing about in a chaotic and unorganised manner, crucially, there is no winner; merely schoolboy antics which ultimately makes both sides look as pathetic as each another. Parker and Stone's film is a scathing metaphorical documenting of a foreign policy full of ill-advised and dangerous decisions which endangers many and destroys nations and lives in the process. At a time when many American comedies have annoying habits of just playing material 'safe', Team America: World Police is the welcome tonic.",Team America - World Police

37,Anonymous_Maxine,At least they didn't take sides,6,25 October 2004,"In a time when the political world in America is so divided that almost no one can talk about politics without praising one side unconditionally and damning the other side unconditionally, it's nice to see a political parody that is daring enough to bash both sides. Unfortunately, it's not nearly as funny as it should be, but that's not entirely the fault of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, I think. Making the film entirely with marionette's is completely within the expected style of Stone and Parker, who go to great technological lengths to make South Park look as simplistic as it does, but there is an element of surrealism to it that takes away from the comedy.The opening scene, for example, is not only too realistic in appearance but also too realistic as far as things like that happening in the real world. You want to laugh at the ridiculousness of these string puppets blowing themselves up, but then you don't want to laugh at real deaths that are occurring in all too similar ways at this very moment. I got the feeling in the theater that a lot of people wanted to laugh at the puppets but weren't sure if the subject matter was funny at all. It wasn't.The musical scenes are the funniest parts of the movie, oddly enough, especially such scenes as our introduction to Gary Johnston, the team's infiltration expert, I guess, when he's singing a tasteful song in a Broadway musical called 'Lease,' and by far my favorite, 'Pearl Harbor sucked and I Miss You.' As Homer Simpson might say, it's funny because it's true.I went into the movie looking to see how the movie would smear the war on terrorism, not quite as much because of my own political views but because I tend to think that during a war is not the best time to oppose it with things like this movie. The movie does not dissent, it ridicules. Even with a foreign policy as disastrous as the current one, ridicule will not serve the same purpose as peaceful dissent. The movie does not, however, take either side, but rather sets out to offend as many people on both sides as possible.Personally, I found it just as offensive as I found it funny. Not much. The very title of the movie parodies what America role seems to think it plays in the world, which might offend Bush fans, and every major Hollywood celebrity who has spoken against Bush shows up in the movie pretty much just to get killed, which might offend more leftist viewers. I guess I just wasn't offended in the same way that I wasn't offended to see Michael Moore stomped by a gigantic elephant at the Academy Awards last year. This is all supposed to be simple, comedic fun. Not clean fun, but fun nonetheless.Speaking of the celebrities, I thought they were probably the best part of the film, even though they served no purpose other than to serve as fodder to ridicule the left, since the left tends to be so against the war that the movie exists to bash. All of the celebrities look startlingly similar to their flesh and blood counterparts (except for Alec Baldwin and Michael Moore, who look absolutely nothing like their human selves), and besides, there's nothing like a good impression, right?On the other hand, the way that reality is portrayed in this movie is a little off-putting at times. It is massively childish, as is to be expected from Stone and Parker, but it has a political consciousness, at least enough to understand that there is something seriously wrong with what is going on in the political sphere right now (on all sides, not just with the current administration), but when you combine that consciousness with the childishness, you get things like death scenes reflecting genuine death scenes in real life, and they're supposed to be funny. I am truly thankful, for example, that Parker and Stone did not have the bright idea that they should try to make a beheading scene funny. I like to think that something that barbarically tasteless would get the movie banned (if not prevent it from having been made in the first place), but there are scenes in the movie that didn't stop too short of that. Not many, but they're there.That being said, I'd like to reiterate that it is all in mindless fun, and I hope that Stone and Parker wanted to allow us to escape from the current tornado of politics and just look at it from a different perspective, hopefully give everyone on all sides a chance to laugh at themselves, but it makes the mistake of thinking, or at least trying to make people believe, that it really is all a joke to be laughed at. The movie does not exist to allow people to look at the lighter side of the war on terror, because there is no lighter side, and it doesn't exist to bash either side. It is a parody of many aspects of the current American position in the world, but it is the seriousness of that position and it's implications that makes some things in the movie, which were meant to be funny, hard to laugh at. I hope that people can take the movie for what it is and appreciate things in it that are genuinely commendable (such as the startlingly realistic sets and the hilarious musical numbers) without losing sight of the realness of the world that the movie portrays.And by the way, please don't e-mail me and tell me to lighten up. If you think I need to lighten up, you have lost sight of the realness of the world that the movie portrays.",Team America - World Police
38,paul-allaer,"If you like ""South Park"", you'll love ""Team America: World Police""",7,24 July 2020,"As ""Team America: World Police"" (2004 release; 98 min.) opens, we are in ""Paris, France, 3,630 miles east of America"", and a group of Arab terrorists is about to get away with WMD. But that's not counting on Team America, which appears out of nowhere to stop the terrorists. Crazy fighting ensue, but Team America prevails. Afterwards Carson (of Team America) proposes to Lisa (also of Team America), but before Lisa can say yes (or no), Carson is shot and killed by one final remaining terrorist. We then shift to Gary, a Broadway performer. Gary is courted by Team America leader Spottswoode to join Team America. Why? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this film is the latest brainchild from Treu Parker and the rest of the gang behind ""South Park"", and this film feels very much in the same vein as ""South Park"". For reasons unknown to be, the film makers decided to film this with puppets, very much like the TV series ""Thunderbirds"", and hence the puppet strings are very noticeable but not distracting. The movie's pace is fast and furious and I'm sure that I missed quite a few details and references, both in the visuals as in the dialogue. The infamous sex scene is hilarious and just laugh out loud funny (and to think that the original longer scene cost the movie an NR or X rating...).This movie came out in 2004, and even though I love ""South Park"", I had never seen ""Team America: World Police"", that is until a few days ago when I saw in on HBO. Better late then never, I suppose. Anyway, if you are up for something funny and crude and offensive all at the same time, this one's for you.",Team America - World Police
39,jamesrupert2014,"Uneven, a bit obsolete but still wildly funny (in places)",8,31 May 2020,"Team America saves the world from a terrorist plot masterminded by North Korea's Kim Jong-Il in this over-the-top parody of jingoistic action films that features a cast of violent, foul-mouth, promiscuous marionettes primarily voiced by creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The humour is hit-and-miss. There are brilliant moments like the death of Hans Blix (remember him?), Kim Jong-il's black-panthers, the climatic fight with the celebrity forces of F.A.G., and the collateral destruction of international landmarks as the Team saves the world. There are tedious moments, like the vomiting scene or the 'ba--s vs. pu--ies vs. a--holes' monologue. The puppetry, reminiscent of Gerry Anderson's beloved Supermarionation adventures such as 'Thunderbirds' (1965) is amusing and the songs are great (especially the driving 'America F -yah' and Kim Jong-il's plaintive 'I'm So Ronry'). I've seen the film a couple of times since it came out (and still laugh) but first-timers may find the topicality is badly dated (and the world is weirder now than we could have imagined in 2004). Parker and Stone are very talented writers and, for all the crudeness, profanity, and deliberately provocative political incorrectness, 'Team America', like 'South Park' (the TV show and the movie), is oddly sophisticated and works at a number levels. That said, a lot of people despised the film and its creators, but not me.",Team America - World Police

Well, let's see...They're not above shagging the hell out of another team member, puppet-style.They're not above getting ""fall-down"" drunk and puking their puppet-guts out all over the place.They're not above using the most disgustingly offensive and excessively profane language in order to get their point across.They're not above eating out another team member's puppet-ass.They not above mocking, ridiculing and, then, gunning-down other puppets (not on the team, of course) who are made in the image of Hollywood celebrities, like Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, and Helen Hunt.They're not above making endless sexist/racist/homophobic jokes.And finally - - To prove their loyalty to the team, a Team America recruit is not above sucking another team member's puppet-dick.Team America puppets love nothing more than to annihilate, with extreme prejudice, other puppets who are made in the image of Arab and/or Asian ""Terrorists"".When on a fearless mission to rid the world of these terrorist-scum, Team America puppets think nothing of completely destroying another country's national monument in the process, like toppling the Eiffel Tower in France, or blasting to smithereens the Great Pyramids in Egypt. (It's all in a day's work) Overall, I'd say that Team America's outrageous humour worked to its advantage about half the time. And the second half of this film was when things really started to cook for the Team America puppets when the diabolical Emperor, Kim Jong ll (with his evil ""hidden agenda"") held a World Peace Conference in Korea.Yes, indeed, there were some mighty funny moments in this deliberately offensive film.

41,dfranzen70,Disappointingly juvenile,5,26 June 2005,"At first, you think a broad parody of Michael Bay action movies done with marionettes by the creators of South Park would be an instant bullseye. Then you see your hopes dashed when you realize it's all just an excuse to cuss a lot and show puppets having sex. But more on that later.But the sad truth is that Team America doesn't live up to its own hype. Sure, the use of marionettes is cute, but it's just a novelty, one whose appeal fades during the first twenty minutes or so.South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut seemed to me to be what Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted the television series to be - if they didn't have to bother with censors and sensibilities. The movie was a giant middle finger to Hollywood and the MPAA, too. Team America merely repeats the gesture, only with the puppet novelty.The story goes thus. Gary Johnston, a Broadway actor, is recruited by Team America, an organization dedicated to ridding the world of evil dictators and terrorists. The team, with the wheelchair-bound Spottswood e (note the clumsy pun) as its leader - needs an actor who can get them into and out of situations seamlessly. Once they've thwarted a terrorist meeting in Cairo - laying the city to waste in its wake - they learn of a bigger plot involving the use of WMDs.The plot is fairly topical - will anyone remember who Hans Blix was, 20 years hence? - but for the moment it's not a hindrance. It's quite simplistic, but of course it's meant to be, since the movie is parodying simplistic Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster extravaganzas.But even if you get past the dopey plot, you quickly notice that the jokes aren't terribly funny; they're scattershot, much like the ubiquitous machine guns employed in the film. And the songs aren't all that memorable, unless you count remembering that there was a plethora of profanity as being memorable.In essence, Team America is what you might expect to be produced by a first-year film student with no morals. Crude and graphic, it fails on its most appealing level: satire of both the worldview of the United States and the propensity of Hollywood to make loud, meaningless action movies. The jokes and ideas aren't sly and knowing, they're obvious and pointless.There's nothing wrong with being offensive, of course; Parker and Stone do it for a living. But in the past, they've been offensive with a greater purpose - often the satire of commonly held mores or institutions.Which brings me to the puppet coitus. It's not amusing. It's not titillating. It just kind of makes you uncomfortable, like catching monkeys at the zoo going at it. The difference here is that as audience member you're sort of captive, whereas in the zoo you can keep on walking.Keep walking, folks. Nothing to see here.",Team America - World Police
42,dee.reid,Puppet Politics,10,16 October 2004,"""Team America: World Police"" is a great sendoff to one of the most turbulent times in American history, and ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, both equal opportunity offenders, pull no strings (no pun intended) with this hilarious and blazingly satiric model of the United States and its supposed role in world affairs.But again, what better way is there to remember the tumultuous reign of the U.S. and its War on Terror than to make a movie that satirizes the living hell out of both? Like their previous effort ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut,"" they take chances that no other filmmaker in America is ever willing to take, and that is to be as crude and vulgar as humanly possible for 90 minutes straight.Anyone expecting an anti-Bush treatise like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" or a pro-Kerry ad campaign will be sorely mistaken. It's really best that liberals and conservatives both stay as far away from this movie as possible, as they both get their fair share of bashing. Parker and Stone have even said that anyone who thinks it should be used to sway votes is a ""f**king idiot."" America itself seems to be at the top of their hit list, or at least American bravado is.As a casual fan of ""South Park,"" I understand that Trey Parker and Matt Stone go to the extreme in making fun of American culture and lampooning people they don't like. Already they've gotten ""fan"" mail from Sean Penn, who is understandably upset over his portrayal in the film, as well as several other liberal celebrities who are portrayed as being backstabbing morons.But I'm not really here to argue political bias in this film (George W. Bush has got to go come November 2nd, in case anyone wants to know), and the perfect satire has come to fuel the fire of the most important election in United States history.""Team America: World Police"" is hugely inspired by the ""Thunderbirds"" marionette cartoons that aired during the 1960s, and it shows us a TEAM of Americans that POLICE the WORLD. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il has weapons of mass destruction and has implemented plans to use them. So Team America goes to work to foil his evil plans. In doing so, they lay waste to several world landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Sphinx, and the Egyptian pyramids.""America"" parades through virtually every action movie cliché imaginable, most notably from the films of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, whose ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) gets lampooned the worst; they even hit ""Top Gun"" (1986).There is no question that ""Team America: World Police"" is inspired and imaginative film-making, made by two creative geniuses who LOVE to push the envelope anywhere they can. Liberal Hollywood celebrities get some of the worst bashing here, with political gadfly Michael Moore playing the part of a hot dog-munching suicide bomber and Alec Baldwin as the leader of the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G., get it?). But conservatives aren't off the hook either, as their politics of U.S. intervention in every world affair is taken to ridiculous heights, hence the title ""World Police.""""Team America: World Police"" is a brilliant satire of our times, of course that doesn't make it safe from the detractors who claim that Parker and Stone are irresponsible morons. Indeed, there are smarter ways to approach such sensitive material, but Parker and Stone aren't intellectuals who are out to change the world, they're just two guys who like to fool around and make people laugh.""Team America: World Police"" - 10/10",Team America - World Police

44,jimbo-53-186511,Tries too hard at times and is a little too obvious but when it hits it is pretty funny,4,17 March 2016,"Broadway actor Gary Johnston is selected for a covert mission by Spottiswoode who is the head of a counter-terrorist organisation AKA Team America. Spottiswoode selects Johnston as he believes that Johnston's excellent acting skills will be a key asset to his organisation in helping to uncover information about a planned terrorist attack which is being orchestrated in Cairo. Spottiswoode (along with the assistance of his team) sends Johnston to Cairo to put his acting skills to good use by infiltrating the terrorist's plans and ultimately help Team America prevent a potential world disaster.When done right films like Team America can be a breath of fresh air which can provide a bit of escapism. They give Joe Public the opportunity to forget about real world problems and try to essentially laugh in the face of adversity. For me, these sort of satires have to have a modicum of intelligence to really work and despite Team America having its moments a lot of this fell flat for me....I found, at times, that Team America actually fell victim to its own satire; this is highlighted in the clichéd melodrama that we see between Lisa and Johnston. We're presented with a heavy on/off romance between the two characters, but it's never shown in an amusing or ironic way which seemed strange as it's supposed to be a satire. The character failings are further evidenced with everyone welcoming Johnston with open arms except the one tough guy who doesn't trust him. Stuff like this always seems at odds with what the whole point of the film is and again in all of this I saw very few examples of good satire.I also found that Parker used the wrong approach with Kim Jong Il - whilst I'm prepared to accept that the character they presented us with is probably a fairly accurate presentation of Kim Jong Il (albeit in an exaggerated sense) I just didn't find his character funny and again perhaps it's because he was portrayed in an obvious and mostly serious way rather than in a satirical way.It's not all bad though and Team America does have some very good moments; the scene between the United Nations bloke and Kim Jong Il was one of the better examples of satire. I have to admit that my childish side did find the F.A.G gag to be funny as well - although it may be quite offensive to some of those who 'get' the joke. Johnston's moment where he 'takes one for the team' was also amusing. Oh yeah and the puppet sex is also pretty funny!!Team America isn't a total waste of time and it's fairly short running time means that it is a tolerable film at the very least. However, it's wildly uneven and sadly only a few gags worked for me (with only one gag being a truly good example of satire). There are very few laughs on offer here and sadly a handful of funny gags in a film that's close to 100 minutes simply isn't good enough.

Director Trey Parker and his writing partner Matt Stone prove that even 9/11 won't get in the way of a good gay or poop joke. It's one way to strike a blow for freedom, though not a guarantee of great comedy, even for the ""South Park"" gang.I admit I watched ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut"" six years ago with the hope I wouldn't like it. The series was a guilty pleasure, but the review in Entertainment Weekly made the movie sound like the greatest satire ever filmed, something I found irksome. To my short-sighted disappointment, the film was great, one of those rare movies that made you laugh from beginning to end, yet gave you ideas to chew on about censorship and obscenity, not to mention some super songs.I was disappointed seeing ""Team America,"" too, for a completely different reason. This time I was rooting for Parker and Stone, especially after they took early heat from the Left despite the fact they clearly made fun of the neo-cons, too. Alas, this time it WAS a disappointment. The songs here are funny, if not as melodically solid as with ""South Park""  ""Up There"" would be a killer number in any musical. The humor starts out strong but wilts after ten minutes, giving you moments here and there but a lot of dead air, too. Maurice LaMarche nails Alec Baldwin, though that also points up the weakness in Parker and Stone's voice work playing everyone else. Worst of all, I never got the sense there was any underlying point to this film, to all the vulgarity and crudity being poured onto my lap, other than Parker and Stone wanting to show they had the cahones to do it.Even the funniest moments have weaknesses. When we first meet Gary Johnston, the main character, he is performing in the Broadway musical ""Lease"" with a showstopper finale: ""Everyone Has AIDS."" That provides anti-PC humor at its best [""My grandma and my dog Ole Blue/The Pope has got it and so do you/C'mon everybody we got quiltin' to do""] but not exactly freshest; the red AIDS ribbon that rises up off the stage like a disco ball feels like a '90s throwback because it is, just like the Jerry Bruckheimer movies that the film parodies throughout.When the material is more currant, it's scarcely better. I admire any movie made in 2004 that makes fun of Michael Moore, but the satirists can't manage to do anything more with him than blow him up, which not only misses the point of Moore's cultural relevance but makes him more heroic than anything else, someone willing to die for his convictions rather than make money off them. Similarly, the assorted killing of left-leaning movie stars (as well as people like Liv Tyler and Samuel L. Jackson, who aren't especially political but apparently fun to kill in the Parker/Stone mindset) has zero satirical value and just bogs down the story.The anti-PC vibe in ""Bigger, Longer And Uncut"" was a source of strength. Here, it feels dated. Having Kim Jong-Il talk like a Catskills impersonation from the 1950s works for a minute, but it doesn't go anywhere, and his ""I'm So Ronree"" number sags from beginning to end.That said, the film does make you laugh, and the puppet production work is ingenious enough to make the film worth seeing for that alone. But given the heavy issues it plays with, and the comedic talent involved, I had hopes for something more than a middling, infantile comedy that presents swearing puppets and scatological sex as cutting-edge comedy.",Team America - World Police
48,ptb-8,one of the top ten political satires of all time,8,24 January 2011,"The 60s might have had DR STRANGELOVE and the 70s MASH and CATCH 22 but the bar has been re set so high this clever new century by TEAM America and it's scathing hilarious turn satirizing the US military industrial machine of the Bush Administration. TEAM America is an outrageous production in its puppet detail and ribald satire. Everyone cops it and the singling out of Kim Jung Il for special 'lonely' treatment is laugh out loud. in fact there must be a big joke a minute in this bewilderingly clever comedy. As with truly excellent humor and satire it is often in the delivery that the best laugh is found, and constantly the skewering of untouchable targets, especially the Film Actors Guild, Matt Damon, and US blunderbuss diplomacy makes for satisfying hilarious viewing. To carry off this level of political whacking is a feat in itself, to use Thunderbirds style puppetry and the amazing detail in the miniatures is a creative feat that matches the barbed with of Parker and Stone. Jaw dropping crudities and knee slapping hilarity makes TEAM America the most accurate vicious and perfect political war clout one could wish for.",Team America - World Police
49,aidanratesmovies,Another hit from Parker and Stone,8,2 September 2020,"Crude, offensive, and by all means raunchy- Team America: World Police is not only an incredibly inappropriate puppet comedy- but a very amusing one as well. Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park crafted this little flick, and its design is certainly different than anything we have seen in comedy before. It's use of puppets is not only odd and weirdly funny, but original, and surprisingly well produced. The film itself though, at least in a writing point of view, isn't anything too special. It contains many formulaic attributes of many other spy or secret organization like films, and also contains some storyline cliches that you are bound to have recognized from other films in the past. The humor in the film may be rather offensive to some, but to those who aren't easily offended, it is truly a laugh riot at times. It's vulgar, crude, and at all times rude- and nothing seems to stop this film from pushing every limit possible in the best way possible. It's voice talents are grand as always, nothing new really in that department. I also surprisingly enjoyed the original songs and music within the film, as silly as they all were, I found them to be rather catchy and very fun to listen to. In the end, Team America: World Police is a fun little raunchy puppet comedy- that can be familiar at times, but rather unique at others due to Parker and Stone's hilarious production style.

50,caspian1978,Kim Jong Il on a string,7,21 October 2004,"It's not Gone With the Wind, but it is a great movie! Parker & Stone push the envelope again and again in this off the wall comedy that would make Jim Henson stand up and cheer. Any comedy that portrays Kim Jong Il as a lonely, confused and mad dictator deserves an audience. The creators of South Park pock fun at politics, celebrities, terrorism, James Bond, and puppets, while also creating a funny and well done musical soundtrack that is better than the South Park Musical / Comedy. Off the wall for most of the movie, the puppets having sex only is worth accepting this movie into the cinematic hall of fame. The vomit scene, the death of Kim Jong Il, the musical score, the montage parody and the production value are all worth it. A movie for all South Park fans, this blows (literally) Base-ket Ball out of the theater.",Team America - World Police

Directed by Trey Parker (of 'South Park fame'). Essential viewing, especially in the light of the new political crisis with North Korea.

52,rosscinema,Parker and Stone skewer both sides,7,31 October 2004,"If your not familiar with ""South Park"" and hate the type of politically incorrect humor this film brings than your going to truly despise this. But I'm one of those who can see humor in just about everything and this film relentlessly targets both liberal Hollywood and right wing military forces but it's also a satire on the over blown and cheesy action flicks that studios commonly churn out. Story is made with marionette puppets where we see Team America combating terrorist forces around the world and after one of them is killed in France they need someone new to round out the group. Team America consists of Joe, Chris, Lisa, Sarah, and headed by Spottswood who decides to recruit actor Gary into the circle and brings him to their headquarters inside Mount Rushmore.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Gary agrees to help out but what they all don't know is that North Korea's Kim Jong Il is selling weapons of mass destruction to other countries and his plans are of course to make the United States a third world country and he decides to hold a summit in Hong Kong with members of the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.) hosting the event.This film is made by both Trey Parker and Matt Stone and together they crudely mock both sides of the political spectrum and while some politically correct viewers will be offended I personally enjoy humor that goes over the line. One of the reasons the Farrelly Brothers are so successful is because everyone and everything is a target but if your one of those of the faint hearted than this is something way over your head. I found the skewering of Liberal actors extremely funny from Janeane Garofalo spouting ""Lets read articles in newspapers and then recite them so we'll sound smart"" to Sean Penn uttering ""In Iraq there were rivers of chocolate"". The ultimate stab at these liberals is when Team America is forced to kill all of them and it's hard to forget the shot of Garofalo getting her head blown off! Parker and Stone have their usual patented musical numbers and the songs have titles such as ""Pearl Harbor Sucked"", ""I'm So Ronery"", and the rousing ""America, F*** Yeah!"". This film isn't just about making fun of current events and one of the best things about this is the satirizing of the Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer action films. One thing that I found interesting is the puppet Chris that hates actors after getting raped by cast members of ""Cats"". He bears a striking resemblance to actor Martin Kove (Rambo, The Karate Kid) who's had roles in countless action films. This definitely is not a film for everyone but if your a fan of the South Park show and it's creators than this is pretty much right up your alley. This film is inspired by the ""Thunderbirds"" and has a script thats designed to be rude, lewd, and crude and touches on enough subjects to offend everyone. Works for me!",Team America - World Police
53,RainDogJr,Matt Damon,10,20 September 2008,"18/09/08""Team America"" quickly became a favourite of mine. I watched it for the very first time backing 2005 and later I bought its DVD and of course I watched it again. Last Tuesday my cousin got ""Team America"" on DVD and together with some friends we watched it. Was a long time since I watched this film for the last time however I do had in my memory many stuff that in 2005 I found just hilarious. Now is the same fun, I think I even enjoyed it more this time and is still one of my favourites films of 2004 and just another work of Trey Parker and Matt Stone that I love.For them, Parker and Stone, was just a -pleasant- surprise to watch the work that the people were doing for their script. By watching the film you will be impressed and thinking in stuff like ""what is the real size of that models?"" all of those types of questions can be answered by watching the bonus material of the DVD. They did just an amazing work, it was something different something that they never did before. Many puppeteers for only one puppet; All of them working as a team, in order to make something almost impossible, something that most of them considered to be the greatest work of their lives. Certainly they had a big admiration for Parker and Stone's previous works so quickly they were involved in this project. They did a remarkable work and their acting delivered a lot of funny and memorable moments. Parker and Stone wanted to make a Bruckheimer movie with puppets. It is a great take on action films. We have the classic heroic team, of course they are Americans and they are out there with good intentions trying to make of the world a better place. Team America: World Police only works for one thing and with that we will watch many explosions all around the globe. France and Egypt are some of the places where we will watch some action product of the war against terrorism. But between many explosions and many killings there is the drama and the classic relationships inside the team. And is so classic and so funny to see that most of the members of Team America: World Police (there are seven members: Lisa, Carson (who dies after the very first and terrific sequence), Sarah, Joe, Chris, Spottswoode and later Gary) have feelings for someone of the team, of course for most of them is a secret, and at one point we will see a depressed team going out to get some terrorist down. Both Parker and Stone hate actors so here actors will have a very important role. In their battle against terrorism Team America: World Police will present their new and biggest cast with an actor, all the hopes are based on the acting of Gary. He is such a great actor and with the impressive technology of the team he will be a terrorist (hilarious!!!) but he has a dark past, a tragedy that marked him forever, and a conscience but not only that, at one point he will be in a very difficult situation: he must make a better acting than who is not only his idol and biggest inspiration but also who is the greatest actor of all time. Of course I'm talking of Alec Baldwin. Famous actors are so important so they can be leading politic movements. My favourite puppet is the one of Sean Penn and the one of Martin Sheen, is hilarious to see Samuel L. Jackson (he is everywhere!) and Michael Moore however Matt Damon is the one who steals the show of the famous actors. So with many actors we will have the future not only of a country but the future of the entire world in the hands of two actors. Even that Alec Baldwin is the greatest actor of all time (hey remember the Baldwins in the South Park film?) Gary did something more than great, such a wonderful and memorable speech about d****, p****** and a******* that was enough. And Team America: World Police will be there every time they are needed and every time they are not, they will be there when the return of Kim Jong-il takes place (his dead is similar to the dead of Saddam Hussein in the South Park film by the way), they will be there fighting and destroying cities for the peace in the world. The puppet of Kim Jong-il is almost as memorable as Hussein. Here we see him as the classic powerful but lonely leader and we see him as the singer. Again the musicals of this film are just terrific and hilarious. ""America F*** Yeah"" is f****** great and of course the most representative, the one that resumes how Team America: World Police sees their function in the world. However is with ""The End of an Act"" with the one I identify the most (part of its lyrics: ""Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies? I guess Pearl Harbor sucked Just a little bit more than I miss you""). On that way I can write a long list of favourites moments but if that list must be resume in two moments they are the sex and the vomit scene.Anyway, this film is just another way to enjoy and laugh at the brilliant work of Trey Parker and Matt Stone; Hilarious, unique and certainly very re-watchable. I love it.-America... F*CK YEAH! Coming again, to save the mother f*cking day yeah, America, F*CK YEAH! Freedom is the only way yeah, Terrorist your game is through cause now you have to answer too, America, F*CK YEAH! So lick my butt, and suck on my balls, America, F*CK YEAH!

Still, this film is really funny at some points, but it just really gave me chuckles throughout.There are more ""squeamish"" moments in here than comedy. Some of it is so disgusting, it's not funny (or maybe it is). I also have a same problem in this film like I had with Talladega Night. I know this movie is a comedy, but it tries to be a dramedy. Someimtes, I really don't know if this film actually tries to be serious.When watching this film, don't expect to laugh out loud throughout the film. In fact, think of it as an action film.

Plus the characters are barely interested as our protagonist is one of the worst ones in the history of motion pictures.The theme song I admit is catchy.

I do concede that the makers achieved what they set out to do, and the puppetering is excellent, But sadly it just isn't for me.Approach with caution this movie has Strings attached and could easily disappoint members of its target audience, if they expect too much from it.The odd moment of Hilarity simply isn't enough to carry the film for over 90mins 4/10",Team America - World Police
58,MartianOctocretr5,Insane and hilarious,7,11 November 2006,"A guilty pleasure for sure. The humor is brazenly sophomoric, but this film gets away with it. Seeing marionettes performing the outrageous events in this chaos evoked some of the loudest laughs I've enjoyed in quite some time.Terrorists, led by Korean dictator Kim Jong Il (sounding a lot like Elmer Fudd with a head cold) who has a routine aspiration to take over the world, are up against the Team America World Police. Peace activists from Hollywood also find their way into this film's psychotic universe. The socio-political mockeries are rampant everywhere, and no one is safe from this movie's vigilante response. Characters are impaled, decapitated, shot up, burned up, drowned, blown to bits etc.The deliberately hokey puppetry work is priceless. Wires are clearly visible, (but cleverly not visible when the focus joke of a scene would be upstaged by their appearance), and the awkward, jerky movements while walking or dancing are integrated well. Puppets seen bouncing around in vehicles, or sitting stiffly in their chairs make the effect obvious too. My personal favorite action scene is the aerial dogfight while the Team America freedom fighters are discussing their soap opera love entanglements while they blast enemy planes in cheesy special effects explosions.No mention of this film would be complete without acknowledging the brilliant love ballad, ""Pearl Harbor Sucks, and I Miss You."" This gag was absolute genius (and I couldn't agree with the sentiment more). Some of the other music score was clever too, fitting the general tone and style of the movie's humor.There's a lot of language and intimate scenes not appropriate for all audiences. There seems to be a trend lately to show somebody puking, too, and the movie has a grossly protracted scene of this which seems like the film makers felt obligated to include it. Some of the in-your-face gross-out humor is overdone, but the movie is still overall a laugh riot.Recommended for most audiences, if gross-out humor doesn't bother you.",Team America - World Police
59,dunmore_ego,Be afraid. Be very afraid. Of the heroes.,8,2 June 2009,"TEAM America WORLD POLICE: saving the world from terrorism... whether we like it or not. It's like THUNDERBIRDS for assholes.Once again the SOUTH PARK instigators (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) steer into the curve with a raunchy, revolutionary, incitant comedy gem. With R-Rated puppets! The Team America counter-terrorism ""freedom fighters"" (runway model types all) must foil a world-domination plot by Kim Jong Il (sounding suspiciously like Eric Cartman), by recruiting actor Gary Johnston (voiced by Trey Parker) to go undercover and infiltrate terrorist cells.Gary is pulled from his Broadway musical, LEASE, (their opening song, ""AIDS AIDS AIDS, Everyone has AIDS..."") and reluctantly takes the reins of responsibilities as a superspy, his decision helped by falling for his co-superspy, Lisa (Kristen Miller). Then he must deal with the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G., headed by Alec Baldwin, ""the greatest actor on Earth""), a computer named I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., WMDs and Kim Jong Il.The brilliant and underrated Parker and Stone (with co-writer Pam Brady) once again push at the boundaries of political correctness, good taste and censorship, as they walk a tightrope parodying terrorism, Amerikan jingoism, their own industry and the stars that populate it.In the first explosive, action-packed scene, Team America destroys the Eiffel Tower and Louvre while trying to corner a terrorist carrying a suitcase WMD. Dubya would be proud - if he could understand the biting sarcasm. Written on the side of a helicopter that lands on a street vendor's stall and crushes it, ""We Protect We Serve We Care."" Piling cliché on cliché (from the ""Noooo!"" scene when a lover dies in a woman's arms, to The Montage - ""Even ROCKY had a Montage""), TEAM America is an action-musical-political-comedy that spans the globe and gives the middle finger to everyone, not just jingoist Amerikans and Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay. From destroying pyramids, to chunderous puppet vomiting, to Kim Jong Il's touching ballad, ""I""m So Ronery"" (i.e. ""I'm So Lonely"" with a Korean accent), to overzealous full frontal puppet hardcore sex and the rousing ""dicks, pussies and assholes"" speech, TEAM America is one shocking gut-laugh after another.And where else would Team America's secret headquarters be, but in a hollow Mount Rushmore, with the presidents' faces as secret entrances? By the time kids discover this movie is too nuanced for them to understand and appreciate fully, they've grown into the adults that will change the world, and will hopefully have been influenced by the electric revolutionary ideas of the modern day radical activists, Trey Parker and Matt Stone.Either that, or they actually join Team America in destroying the world, i.e. the Amerikan Military or the Republican Party.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Team America - World Police
60,xredgarnetx,Great action flick,7,27 December 2005,"No point in me reviewing TEAM America, as I came to it late. I just watched it at the insistence of a co worker. Read the review by theunemployedcritic. But I will say this sendup of Bruckheimer and Bay action movies (it started out as an all-puppet remake of Armageddon) works perfectly. And through all the clichés and stereotypes and snarky humor, you actually begin to think of the damned puppets as real characters, and feel for them. Amazing! I don't imagine we are likely to ever see a $30 million Paramnount release involving wobbly puppets again, but it sure worked this one time. Some wonderful things to watch for: the sets and puppet heads are magnificently and complexly executed, and the film is shot like a $100 million James Bond extravaganza. The special effects are also top notch, especially a prolonged vomit scene that will have you wondering how did they do that? But then the boys do silly things to remind us we're watching puppets, such as a close-in karate fight where the two fighters simply knock against each other, legs flailing, or a dance sequence involving two team members simply bobbing up and down, or the hero waving for help, his stick arms shaking like branches in a tornado. There's even a deleted scene on the DVD where several of the characters hurl accusations of being nothing more than puppets at each other. Wonderful stuff. There are dozens of movie references throughout, probably too many to catch in one viewing. My favorite, and probably most obscure to the average film-goer, is from THE HIDDEN. It occurs just before the finale, and involves a talking cockroach. Watch for it.",Team America - World Police
61,gianmarcoronconi,Very funny,8,21 July 2021,"Very funny movie and very exaggerated throughout its duration, but sometimes this exaggeration is a weak point because it is so exaggerated as to seem embarrassed or unnecessary. In general, the plot is very simple and relies on some points that make you laugh almost necessarily, then the fact that it is done with puppets adds something even more funny.",Team America - World Police
62,BrandtSponseller,"Brilliant, multifaceted satire",10,18 June 2005,"There are a lot of negative reviews of this film that evidence many strange misunderstandings. First off, if you're the type of person who can become offended or grossed-out by anything, there's a good chance that something in Team America: World Police will have that affect on you. After all, the film is produced, directed, written, and co-composed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the guys behind not only ""South Park"" (1997), but also ""That's My Bush"" (2001), and films like Cannibal! The Musical (1996), Orgazmo (1997) and BASEketball (1998).South Park is by far Parker and Stone's most well known work, and there seems to be many strange interpretations of that show floating around. While complaining about various qualities of Team America: World Police, many people have added that they're South Park fans, and somehow, unbelievably implied that South Park tries to be inoffensive, have only sophisticated humor and only exemplary production values while conforming with the conventional wisdom of the various artforms it engages in. That could hardly be further from the truth, and Team America: World Police's embrace of ""crude"", intentionally offensive humor, many purposefully ""bad"" production values, and purposefully rule-breaking approaches to its artforms should come as no surprise to anyone already familiar with Parker and Stone's aesthetic.There also seems to be some misunderstanding of the ""point"" of the film. Team America: World Police is primarily satirizing four things at the same time: (1) marionette-oriented shows such as ""The Thunderbirds"" (1964) (the initial idea was sparked by Parker first seeing The Thunderbirds on television), (2) Recent ""big action movies"", especially of the Bruckheimer/Bay variety (Parker and Stone wanted to just make a marionette version of Armageddon (1998) at one point, but understandably couldn't get the rights), (3) The politics, attitudes and worldview of the United States, especially their international policies, (4) The conventional wisdom depictions of the politics, attitudes and worldview of the United States. (4) is easy to overlook, and is subtly entwined with (3), as well as (2).The plot is centered on a marionette quintet of ""special operations"" agents, a bit like a quintet of James Bonds--three male and two female. They travel around the world, ""fighting the enemies of freedom"", and usually killing a number of innocent people and destroying cultural icons and landmarks along the way. At the beginning of the film, one male member is killed. Gary Johnston, an actor appearing on Broadway in a show called Lease (a spoof of Rent), is recruited by Team America's man behind the scenes, Spottswoode, to take the killed member's place. Spottswoode says they need an actor to infiltrate terrorist circles, as ""Intelligence"" (a dim, Hal-like computer at Team America headquarters) has deduced that something big is about to go down. After initial reluctance, Johnston agrees, undergoes a physical transformation, and begins his undercover work.If you're not the type to become (easily) offended and you're sympathetic to Parker and Stone's worldview, Team America: World Police is hilarious. In addition to the four sources of satire mentioned above, and the many ancillary puns and spoofs--such as the Star Wars cantina scene set in Cairo here--a lot of humor comes from the sheer ridiculousness of marionettes performing this material.To emphasize the ""fakeness"" of the marionettes, Parker and Stone make sure that they're not _too_ authentic looking, and that they do not move _too_ realistically. The marionettes, which were constructed by the Chiodo brothers (or Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988) fame) and their team, as well as the sets, supervised by production designer Jim Dultz, are actually very impressive (the many sets are gorgeously designed). But Parker and Stone make sure that some things are ""off"". We can always see the marionette strings, they make a point to have them walk awkwardly, they use multiple copies of the same body for most of the marionettes of the same gender, and they give them just enough facial expressions to make the marionettes creepy.That same kind of subtly exaggerated-but-disturbing approach is what fuels a lot of the satire, as well. The love scene at the beginning, for example, surrounded by death and destruction, is only slightly exaggerated compared to the stereotypical serious action film. There are many similar moments that will be familiar to action fans.Of course, sometimes the humor isn't so subtle, as in the infamous puppet sex scene, but even though it eventually works its way up to water sports and other body-function fetishes, it's not really that far removed from sudden forays into sex scenes in action and other films.Parker and Stone have a lot of fun slyly showing how the U.S. trudges into areas where it is not wanted and destroys the indigenous cultures while claiming to ""save"" and ""free"" them. That they do this dismantles the strange claim from some reviewers that Team America: World Police is right-leaning in its politics. Just the title of the film should give a clue for that--it and other aspects of the film sarcastically note how the U.S. believes/behaves as if it's the world's police force, as if the world is all just a suburb of the U.S., and as if everyone naturally wants to be just like the U.S.But they also skewer liberal opposition--primarily through the film's depiction of actors speaking out against war and imperialistic foreign policy (but the actors could stand for anyone with similar attitudes--the line about parroting things read in the media is particularly funny). As usual in a Parker and Stone work, nothing is sacred.Typically of Parker and Stone, this is not at all a ""check your brain at the door"" film. It's a complex, intellectual, multifaceted artwork, even if one of their goals is to occasionally just do something goofy, ""stupid"", offensive or break the supposed ""rules"". The two modes are not incompatible.",Team America - World Police
63,Spuzzlightyear,How much is too much?,6,1 January 2006,"Not 100% sure if I enjoyed Team America: World Police as much as I'd like, but oh well. I am sure a lot of people didn't know what to make of this movie from the makers of South Park. An action movie featuring marionettes is something like a live action version of Thunderbirds.. Something I wouldn't really see. But, curiosity got the best of me.. This movie basically details a team's efforts to thwart the leader of North Korea to detonate a weapon of mass destruction (with the help of.. uh.. Alec Baldwin). The group recruit a Broadway actor (hilariously taken from his show called 'Lease' (a send up of 'Rent') and singing what could be the funniest song ever, ""We all have AIDS"". Soon they're off to Paris and Egypt (much to it's expense) and much battling ensues, both between good and evil, and as well, with the team as well. Much has been said about the sex scenes in the film. I can see what was cut, and to the ratings board I say, ""good call!"". Parker and Stone may lead the edge into cutting edge comedy, but they HAVE to draw the line somewhere. As for the rest of the movie, I liked it to a degree, I got the joke about it being way gung ho American, but it soon got tiring after awhile though. This, like South Park, would be better suited as half hour chunks on cable (though I did love South Park: Longer and Uncut). One final note. I feel Parker and Stone NEED to write a Broadway musical and turn it upside down.",Team America - World Police
64,jeremycrimsonfox,The Creators Of South Park Put On A Great Puppet Show,9,30 August 2021,"Team America: World Police may look like another puppet show in the vein of the old Thunderbirds series, but don't be fooled. Directed by Trey Parker, one of the two men who created the popular adult cartoon South Park, who also wrote the script with Matt Stone (the secomd man) and Pam Brady, Team America tells the story of a paramilitary counter-terrorist police force fighting terrorism. While this sounds like G. I. Joe in Thunderbirds form, Team America is rated R as Trey and Matt inject the same humor that made South Park a hit with Comedy Central into the script, as crude humor is present (although this is done sparingly to keep it fresh), and even some scenes of puppet nudity (as the movie does has a romance subplot). The movie does a good job showing the world as it was in 2004, as we were in the middle of a war against terrorists, with Kim Jong-il and many celebrities thrown into the mix.",Team America - World Police
65,hall895,Action. Adventure. Puppets.,7,28 May 2005,"Only from the minds of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone could we get something as truly unique as Team America: World Police. Anyone can do a satire of big-budget action movies. But who else could (or would) do it using puppets?Our puppet heroes (three guys, two gals) are fighting to defeat terrorists around the world. Not the most competent bunch they seem to take out as many historical landmarks as they do terrorists. Soon Team America will come in for criticism from the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G) led by Alec Baldwin. The spot-on lampooning of the haughtiness and condescension of these Hollywood actors is one of the film's strong points. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon...all the usual suspects are here. But the one celeb puppet who steals the show is Matt Damon. Of course the South Park gang isn't interested in skewering only actors, they go after world leaders as well. Where the South Park movie took aim at Saddam Hussein here the villain set up for ridicule is North Korea's Kim Jong Il, performed wonderfully by Parker.Much as in the South Park film there are some truly terrific original songs here. One of the best takes dead aim at Ben Affleck and Pearl Harbor. There are smart parodies of everything from the Star Wars cantina scene to Jerry Maguire to Kill Bill. As would be expected from the South Park crew the humor is rude, crude and nobody is spared. Liberals, conservatives, actors, politicians, UN weapons inspectors, hack movie directors...they all take their shots. It's an entertaining film though it never quite reaches the consistently hilarious heights of the South Park movie. It's funny enough and it certainly is a noteworthy technical achievement. Doing a film of this magnitude with puppets may have seemed like a simple enough idea but done badly it could have been an outright disaster. But the puppets are so well done they at times seem to be able to convey genuine human emotion. Team America: World Police began with a truly innovative idea and in the end it pays off with enough laughs to call it a success.",Team America - World Police
66,CitizenCaine,Team South Park: World Of Meaningless Jokes,5,18 July 2005,"I must confess that I do not watch, nor have I ever seen one single episode of South Park. The idea in Team America: World Police is much more intriguing than the execution of it in this film. Trey Parker and Matt Stone helm the majority of the voices of the characters in this film, which are all puppets. The film satirizes America's war on terror, politics, several movies (among other things), and is equally irreverent to all in its path. Many points are well taken, but some are taken too far, and others are just pointless. It's most successful at poking fun of America, politics, terrorists, and especially Kim Jong II. Kim Jong II's song about being lonely is absolutely hilarious near the end. The film is less successful or weak at making a point or taking any kind of a stand on anything. It seems to just ridicule everything in its path, and, because of this, there are a lot of misses. The highly touted sex scene is one of these misses. The biggest problem with the movie is that its main demographic is not going to see or appreciate all of the more inventive humor in it, but will laugh at the brainless, scatological humor. Adults that see it will tire of the satire when they realize there's no point, and they will find much of the other humor juvenile. This is probably a guilty pleasure at best. ** of 4 stars.",Team America - World Police
67,phubbs,Team America: World Police,8,27 February 2014,"The films title says it all really, a sharp satirical play on the fact that the rest of the globe kinda thinks the US wants to police the world. Business as usual for the South Park creators as they present this biting mockery of a comedy that does one of two things...homage the use of marionettes whilst also taking the mickey, and literately taking the mickey out of American foreign policy.The whole film is a complete send up of your bog standard action flick porn, all the obligatory clichés and stereotypes packed into a smart satire of American politics that naturally revolves around the Middle East. Its all very straight forward, a team of super anti-terrorist soldiers (ala Tom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible') do battle with terrorist threats on a daily basis. During one mission they get captured and must be rescued by the newbie of the team who is unsure of himself, that's virtually it.The first thing that is so funny about this film is the fact its all been created with puppets, yes puppets, just like Thunderbirds. Puppet action heroes doing everything your regular cookie cutter Hollywood action flick does. The film has the visual style of a cool kids show combined with a kids toy line. All the main vehicles of Team America are slick hi-tech super awesome looking power models emblazoned with a red white and blue paint job to nail the Stars n Stripes motif home. The team are decked out in natty SWAT-like uniforms with shades headsets and of course lots of big guns, whilst their base is a typical Bond-esque setup within Mount Rushmore with lots of flashy tech stuff, a big intelligent talking computer and their very own Nick Fury/Professor X type leader. All the bad guys look exactly as you would expect from a satirizing angle of Middle Eastern terrorists, lots of facial hair and rags. Oh and you can see the strings attached to the puppets too further enhancing the laughs.Despite the film looking like a toy merchandise wet dream it is of course a full on adult adventure. This is the amazingly amusing thing about it all, its children's puppets swearing, having rampant sex and being killed in gruesome ways. Just as South Park is funny because its a naughty cartoon this works on the same level. The violence and visual obscenities are created at a puppet level so its never really shocking because its all being done with puppets and its simply more acceptable. A puppet being blown apart or eaten alive by sharks doesn't really shock because we all know its a children's toy, had it been live action it would be pretty horrific.The other main funny bone tickler is the quite brutal mockery of famous stars, Middle Eastern folk, world leaders and of course the action genre. In between all the hyper action flick mockery various real actors get ripped on pretty well along with the Screen Actors Guild which has been hilariously renamed the Film Actors Guild. I loved the ultra liberal portrayal of this celebrity group, the way they are all made out to be enemies of Team America because they want peace and unity with the Middle East. They blame Team America for unnecessary killings, destruction, racism etc...and are blind to Kim Jong-il's plans...oh and the fact almost all of them get killed horribly. Talking of Kim Jong, what a way to go down in movie history! via Trey Parker's gut busting rendition (mocking) in that completely racist voice he does so well, fantastic!.It is completely brilliant how Team America go into missions destroying anything and everything in their path to take down one or two terrorists. The way they blow up half of Cairo and its ancient treasures, Paris with its landmarks and are completely oblivious to the ruin because in the end they got their intended targets, so its all good. Collateral damage at its finest Hoorah!!!.Even though the film can't escape its South Park routes, because its all Trey and Stone, that doesn't hinder it. Yeah all the voices are familiar, the satire isn't exactly new, 'Derkaderkastan' or the term 'Derka' has popped up in various South Park episodes I believe as speech for Africans and Middle Eastern folk, all foreign people simply speak the same kind of gibberish much like they do in certain South Park episodes, there are the odd risqué musical numbers etc...At the same time there are some really edgy moments that seem truly un-PC but its so funny. When Gary infiltrates the terrorist headquarters at the start the puppet has a simple bath towel on his head! then inside the terrorist bar its all made out like the Mos Eisley cantina from 'A New Hope', simple but totally effective.This film is so darn accurate in its analysis of US foreign policies and left wing activism I'm amazed it managed to surface. It virtually mocks everything about America and it all holds up to this day, I imagine it must make some Americans cringe. Next to that the action genre is an easy target but its still skewed perfectly here, right down to the last cheesy cliché. Funny thing is the film also looks terrific and really is a genuine homage to the use of marionettes. Everything looks so rich in detail its actually a shame the content will inevitably upset many in Hollywood, meaning the craftsman involved probably won't get the recognition they deserve, that's irony for you.8/10",Team America - World Police
68,TOMASBBloodhound,A funny perspective on some deadly serious problems.,8,2 March 2008,"It's hard to see what if any message this film really is trying to say about America's war on terror. Though the macho antics of Team America clearly do more damage than many of the acts of terror they set out to prevent, they don't always come off looking that bad. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have never openly taken one side or the other in the political world that this critic is aware of.Team America: World Police is a vulgar, eye-opening, and often perceptive look at an elite team of soldiers who set out to battle terrorists wherever they may be found. They live and train in a secret fortress behind the faces of Mt. Rushmore, and can rapidly deploy at a moment's notice to face virtually any enemy. As part of their war on terrorism, the group recruits a successful Broadway actor to replace a recently killed member. It is hoped that his acting skills will allow himself to be passed off as ""Middle-Eastern"", and he will then be able in infiltrate some of the more dangerous terror cells. After what appears to be initial success, the team then discovers that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il is planning to use America's most liberal A-list actors to distract the world while his agents set off WMDs all over the world. Things culminate in a hilarious showdown within the walls of his palace.Oh, did I mention that everyone in this film is a puppet? Yes, this is a puppet movie. And some of the biggest laughs come from seeing the puppet versions of various famous people. The Sean Penn puppet gave me my biggest laugh of the movie. That thing is a spitting image of him, and its no wonder he got so angry at Trey and Matt for making this movie. Since the characters are not human, Parker and Stone basically have their way with them. Many of them are blown to bits with gory methods, and a sex scene between two of the characters is taken to levels that most hardcore filmmakers would never dream of. The film is every bit as vulgar if not more than the South Park movie, and about as funny as Baseketball. So in other words, you won't be laughing all the time, but you'll always at least have a smile on your face.Some critics, like Roger Ebert, came down hard on this film for taking such a casual approach to US aggression and the war on terror. It's best to just thank goodness that we still live in a free society where a film of this kind with its unique perspective can be made. If anything, the left wing of Hollywood comes off as looking the worst in this film. Some of them, like George Clooney and Matt Damon, actually welcomed their ""participation"" in the film. The more kooky ones like Sean Penn were outraged. Gays might shudder at the concept of the F.ilm A.ctors G.uild, and the send up of the musical Rent which features a song about everyone having AIDS. That one really upset Ebert. Kim Jong Il, who is an ardent movie buff has no doubt seen the film. I'd give anything to hear what he had to say about it. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Team America - World Police

70,gregsrants,Not your Naked Gun type of film,7,17 October 2004,"I always got the feeling watching South Park, the Late Night talk show circuit and their movies that Trey Parker and Matt Stone do whatever they want to make themselves laugh. It's as if they don't care whether the audience gets it or not as long as they laugh continually in the guest chairs or editing rooms at their own adolescence. God bless them.Starting with their South Park cartoon and transferring over to the big screen in such lesser fare as Orgazmo and BASEketball, these two childish stink fingers still find farts, swearing, drinking, sex, blood, blowing up things and puking areas of intense enjoyment. And now, they think they can bring their 4th grade brand of humor to the land of puppetry in a way that could probably awaken Jim Henson from the dead in their new film Team America: World Police. As the story is now told, Stone and Parker were watching the Thunderbirds (a 1960's children's program starring with the characters all being marionettes) when the idea came to them faster than a stink bomb's odor released in a closed closet. These masters of the cut and paste animation scene decided that it would be cool to re-energize the genre and they set out to make a big screen farce that would mock everything from big budget films to every celebrity that has ever spoken their political mind. No doubt happy from the $60 million dollar domestic gross of the South Park: Bigger Longer& Uncut film in 1999, Paramount studios was more than happy to shell out a measly $20 million to allow the boys to again play out their warped little fantasies. It was really a no-lose proposition since the fans of the television show and the ultimate controversy over anything these guys touch was sure to generate enough ticket sales to at minimum pay for itself.What is surprising is that this film actually has pockets of real entertainment and will no doubt triple the studio bosses' money in a matter of weeks.Team America is about a rogue police force that sets its sights on crushing the terrorist threats around the world. In the opening sequence, they find themselves in Paris where terrorists are plotting to destroy parts of the city. The Team America force swoop in and with the gentle force of a hurricane, they open up a can of whoop-ass with their heavy machine and shotgun fire. A result of the gunplay leaves one Team American (and countless Arab looking puppets) dead and the team in dispirits as they head back to base.To fill the void left by the death of their wooden comrade, the teams' sexual-starved-always-drinking leader Spottswoode (I'll leave that one alone) recruits Gary Johnston, a Broadway actor, to assist in the infiltration of the terrorist cell. By disguising him in nothing more than a few clumps of facial hair and a towel on his head, the team relies on Gary to gather recon information regarding the upcoming terrorist activities as orchestrated by mad dictator Kim Jong II. The plot soon reveals that Kim Jong will be using Hollywood actors (Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Sean Penn et al) as a distraction at a peace accord to unleash his terrorist fury on the world, and it is up to Team America to try and save the day.Team America: World Police, plays out like a Bruckheimer film on a bad acid trip. It has all the elements of his cheesiness as seen in bigger budgeted fare like The Rock or Armageddon. There are the insanely evil villains who want nothing less than the complete annihilation of the American people and way of life, there is the troubled hero who quits the team only to come back to save the day and what candle could this film hold if it didn't include a love triangle between three members of the team. Stone and Parker have been quoted as wanting the film to mock the summer blockbuster type film and they do so admirably.Helping bring the romper room comedy to the masses are some incredibly gut jiggling scenes including a drunk Gary spewing like a Monty Python character after a day of heavy drinking, celebrities having their heads blown off in a violent climax and a Broadway musical number about AIDS. But maybe the piece de resistance has to be the sex scene between two of the wooden characters. It was reported that the sensors forced Stone and Parker to trim the scene in order to alleviate themselves from the kiss-of-death NC-17 rating, but I can't imagine what was cut. The scene is explicit, raucous, deplorable and downright funniest few minutes I have spent in a theatre this year.For those of you who like your comedy a la The Naked Gun, I would strongly suggest you steer clear of Team America: World Police. The humor is R-Rated and definitely NOT for the young kiddies. However, for those of you that are like me and spend most of the day watching television seeing terrorist threats, warnings and levels increase, it sure was fun to laugh at it all, even if it was for just a moment.",Team America - World Police
71,aesgaard41,You'll Never Look At Puppets The Same Way Again,4,20 June 2007,"There's a lot of potential in this movie, but for me, it's warped behind offensive sexual references and excessive profanity as if normal people actually inject constant streams of dirty words and porn into their lives. Team America is actually a good parody of action films centering around an elite group of super-cops who are so full on themselves that they don't notice that everyone hates them. On that level, you can understand why several countries hate Americans. Creating the puppet world is a fun angle, and the puppet world with puppet caricatures of Hollywood celebrities adds to the demented charm, but then the complete and blatant irreverence to decency and logic as the so-called ""heroes"" blindly and casually blow up and destroy all the landmarks of the world degrades what would be a fairly decent parody. Trey Parker and Matt Stone work on a sophomoric level where no decent intellectual has ever been before. You will never look at puppets again after watching them vomit and have sex. Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the movie, Stone and Park frequently deviate from the plot to attack everything with profanity and lewd remarks. It's like they purposely thought to themselves, ""who can we offend next?"" The movie is like ""South Park"" crossed with ""GIJoe"" then merged with ""Penthouse."" It's not a good movie, but it's not a bad movie. It's an indecent movie with a billion dollar budget.",Team America - World Police
72,agmoldham,No surprises here,5,16 January 2005,If you see a trailer of this film you'll know exactly what to expect. The film sends up everything to do with American life. The liberals suffer at the hands of the puppets in the same way that the conservatives suffer. It will undoubtedly be the most politically incorrect film of the year. The humour is pure playground humour and even though you know you really shouldn't find it that funny you can't help but laugh.It's quite fashionable to make references to other films nowadays and you'll find plenty of that here.

73,rainking_es,His bark is worse than his bite...,6,20 June 2005,"There's that saying ""his bark is worse than his bite"", and that's exactly what has happened with Parker and Stone's last hooliganism. They announced that ""Team America"" it was gonna be an acid and a fierce critique against all that ""international terrorism"" stuff that the White House is been selling all around the world lastly. I expected such a big dart to family Bush's eyes... But you have to be careful about what the American call ""provocative"" or ""disrespectful"" (they can be so childish sometimes). The fact is that Bush doesn't even appear on the movie and, instead of attacking him, Matt Stone and his partner charge those actor that cried out against the Irak invasion (Robbins, Sarandon, Penn, etc.). Yes, I know, it makes no sense at all! So, making clear that ""Team America"" is not cutting nor prejudicial to the interests of the United States, let's talk about what the film REALLY gives us: typical rough humour made in Stone & Parker Factory, less funny than the first South Park chapters (is the bad thing about this kind of humour: at the end of the day you're sick of it), some brilliant moments (a few of them), and some other (most of them) to forget. The original of it all is the use of real puppets like in Thunderbids or Dark Crystal. That's it: one or two roars of laughter, some smiling, and two thumbs up for the puppeteers.*My rate: 5.5/10",Team America - World Police
74,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Hilarious and inventive,9,1 September 2005,"I am guessing that a satire of the seemingly ridiculous, turbulent, and volatile political situation that followed the 9/11 attacks and the second Gulf War was inevitable. Well here it is, and it couldn't have been better.""Team America"" is a bad-ass group of model Americans that go around the world in their patriotically painted combat vehicles and put down the bad-guys. When their team suffers the loss of member during what ends up being a successful mission in Paris they seek a new recruit: a Broadway actor who can ""act"" like a terrorist and go under cover. From then on it gets only funnier as a plot of worldwide destruction is uncovered. Making appearances in the film are such likable celebrities as Alec Baldwin, Liv Tyler, Matt Damon, Peter Jennings, Michael Moore, Samuel Jackson, and many more including world leaders.The main highlight of the film, however, would have to be the elaborate puppet work and miniature world create for the film. It is incredibly detailed and the action sequences that were choreographed in this miniature artificial world are remarkably well done. So, it is not just a political satire, but a spoof of Hollywood and big budget film making in general. Every big action movie cliché is presented here in one way or another as well as countless homages and spoofs of famous films, aspects of culture, and the use of puppets is a joke onto the art of film making itself. The puppets are treated just like regular puppets: visible strings, no CGI, and even times some plain old clumsy movements. The production is further complemented by a great and equally hilarious musical score.All in all, I'd say this film is one of the best to ever come out in a long while. It's clever, hilarious, inventive, and remarkably satisfying in the end. 9/10 Unrated, contains: strong violence and profanity, and the best in bad taste.",Team America - World Police
75,FilmOtaku,Rarely does a film make me laugh this hard,7,6 November 2004,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone are back again, as offensive as ever, with 'Team America: World Police', a musical/romance/action/drama film that centers on current events, and featuring Thurnderbirds-style puppets. I saw this film on opening night a few weeks ago, and have only just now had a chance to write the review, but while thinking about the film in order to write this review, I even found myself snickering to myself. There's really no point getting into the plot beyond a one sentence description. Team America is a global task force dispatched to fight superheroes and to take care of celebrities who have no problem voicing their political opinions. They have to take on Kim Jong Il and his band of celebrity activists like Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Alec Baldwin in order to save the world. If anyone were to take this film seriously they probably would have been offended within the first minute of the film when Paris is decimated. After that we have many references to gay sex, AIDS, conservativism, liberalism; pretty much name a current taboo or event and it is at least referred to here. This is of course in addition to a graphic puppet sex scene that made the ratings board squirm and cut in order to get an R rating. (It's still worth seeing) All of the above made me laugh harder than I have in ages, save 'Shaun of the Dead'. I had so much fun watching this film, as did just about everyone in the audience as evidenced by the constant roars of laughter. The songs that are included on the soundtrack are so funny and (unfortunately) catchy that I have caught myself singing them off and on during the last couple of weeks. (My personal favorite is the Team America theme, 'America! F**k Yeah!'There is obviously no point in examining the film-making of this film. What I can say is that the use of the puppets was hilarious in itself, and the humor is base, but intelligent at the same time. I am no longer a fan of Parker and Stone's 'South Park', but their comic timing is dead on here, and 'Team America: World Police' is an absolutely hilarious time. If you don't take yourself too seriously, or at least are able to see a tongue that is firmly in cheek, definitely watch this one. I give it a very solid 7/10.Shelly",Team America - World Police

'Team America' in kind, is also only for hard core entertainment junkies.this movie is a lot of candy fun. it's also going to turn your little brains to mush. you need to form a stand or a solid thought eventually to mature and this psycho little film ain't gonna help with that. all this film can do is stunt your mental growth or make you regress. but hey, oddly, sometimes that can be good for you. you know what they say, ""never take things too..."".as insulting as this snide little film gets, it's statement about America and Americans isn't too far off.

Two or three times, if that. Whether you like it or not Team America: World Police (mostly the product of Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park fame) has to be one of the most original production ever. A stroke of imagination if not of genius.If you are at all interested, I never liked Thunderbirds (the clear inspiration for this film) or any puppet-on-a-string series that came out in the late sixties. Too camp and too silly to be of interest to me, even as a child. And as an adult too many bad messages. They were right wing vehicles saying that the only way to stop anyone or anything was through violence. In the end things blow up and the world was saved -- until next week that is.I have to defend Team America on the ground that while it is in bad taste, it is knowingly in bad taste. And it is an equal opportunity knocker too. No one gets out of this unscathed, not even Hollywood liberals that are used here as wonderful stooges, portrayed as using politics to forward their careers. Tim Robbins gets the worst of it -- although Matt Damon is not far behind: Being portaged as a drooling idiot who can barely say his own name! It was first said in WWII that ""the town had to be destroyed in order to save it"" and TA take this to the extreme. No famous building is safe, no monument sacred enough not to be blown up by a stray missile. The Matrix, James Bond, Top Gun and Indiana Jones are clear inspirations - with Kim Jong Il (of North Korea) being the best villain this side of James Bond.To make things even more ludicrous, songs are added in various over-the-top styles. The sex scenes are an absolute hoot - while the final speech about ""pussies, dicks and ass holes"" might be the funniest sets of lines in the whole movie. I didn't even catch all of it because I was laughing too hard. Maybe next time.So finally to the plot: Gary is an actor on a off (or is it on?) Broadway production a bit like Rent only a bit sillier. He is recruited because of his language skills and the ability to impersonate (""that is all spying is -- acting"") by a Spottswoode the puppet master that is controlled by the puppet master - if you see what I mean.What follows is silly, sillier and then even sillier still. I can't go in to it all because I might start laughing again. They say that the DVD is even sillier still with an over-top-sex scene.

I remember when I saw it in theatres when it first came out and the whole theatre was howling with laughter. It was actually kind of annoying because as soon laughter from the last scene finally subsided another hilarious scene would come up and put the theatre into hysterics once again.This is definitely one of my favourite comedies created by the men who brought us the hilarious show South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone who also do most of the voices which they are oh so good at. The movie is very well made and its non stop funny.This movie is about an actor named Gary who is approached by an Agency named Team America. Terrorists are planning a big attack on America and they recruit Gary so he can go undercover and find out where the WMDs are.This movie is pure gold from start to finish. If you don't like South Park you probably wont like this because it does contain a lot of bad language and crude humour but don't let that put you off it is hilarious. Another thing that makes this movie hilarious is its filmed entirely with puppets. So much humour comes from that alone and this is just a great movie if you have not seen it yet stop screwing around and go watch it right now.,Team America - World Police
79,Son_of_Mansfield,Team America! F**k no.,5,29 May 2006,"What works so well on South Park gets completely ignored in Team America: World Police. South Park takes all these issues that Parker and Stone have pointed opinions on and explores them through the use of children, to whom little white lies don't exist. TAWP has no real protagonist, every single being in it is either a moron or an a**hole. It seems to say that everyone is stupid, except Trey Parker and Matt Stone. That is the one thing that bothers me about them, they have Goodyear Blimps for heads. On the other hand, some of their motives come through and the humor works in patches. The puppet sex scene is long and boring, the throw up scene is as pointless as a lampooning Michael Jackson, and the ""beloved"" songs aren't up to Parker and Stones' usual standards; the one exception being the slowed down version of ""America"" complete with cheesy backup singers.

80,raymond-15,Amazing puppetry,8,10 July 2006,"If you are highly sensitive you may find this film rude and crude,violent and cruel, suggestive to an extreme, but it's a production not to be missed, first for its detailed construction of miniature sets and life-like puppets and then for its satirical theme about terrorism. There could not be a more topical subject matter in these times with North Korea threatening to fire missiles around the world.When you read the credits you begin to realize how many man hours went into creating this magical piece of cinema.Apart from the typically jerky movements (marionettes the world over have never walked like human beings) body language and facial expressions are at the peak of puppetry. Try controlling a marionette with four strings yourself, and when you end up in a tangle contemplate the difficulties with a group of puppeteers perched above the set with 6o strings to manipulate! I have to admit I've never seen anything like this in my whole life.Because the theme is about fighting terrorism, pyrotechnics play a large part of the action. The bombing of a ship in the Panama Canal is an amazing piece of film-making with the bursting of the sluice gates and fiery blast of the terrorist bomb followed by a raging flood sweeping all before it.There are many such action scenes and even aerial dog fights as the terrorists are blasted out of the skies. Puppetry in the past has usually been a fairly gentle affair but here we have non-stop violent action. There is however a love story as in every epic filled with danger (""promise me you'll never die!"") As for lampooning world leaders, well we all like to cut down the tall poppies.

It did not disappoint in that sense.But it was also a clever satire of many things, including many blockbuster movie clichés, pornography (could anyone really be excited by genital-less marionettes having sex?), musicals, left-wing ideology and its willingness to turn a blind eye to evil as long as it's anti-American, and a number of pompous egotistical Hollywood celebrities who wallow in their own importance-mentioned by name! This does largely explain why the movie used marionettes; what better way to depict real people while avoiding legal complications? The plot is of course very standard for an actioner, and need not be repeated, though a few surprises-nay, shocks-are thrown in.Overall, highly recommended, but not for the kids or the squeamish.

83,roedyg,Most Irresponsible Movie of all time.,4,2 July 2011,"Trey Parker is a child who likes shocking people. Like a child, he does not care if he harms or even kills people in the process. This is the most irresponsible movie I have ever seen. He has dozens of Hollywood A-List actors play themselves in the form of very realistic puppets. The credits say he got no permission from any of these people. Further he accuses all these actors of treason and malice and kills them all in ways you would think impossibly gory for puppets, suggesting his audience should do likewise. The movie thinks vomit scenes that go on and on an on and anti-gay slurs are the highest form of humour.The philosophy of the movie is that is American nature to be a ""dick"" and it thus has to beat up other countries or it would become a ""pussy"". It does not need any other reason. You might think that was a parody. If it were I am pretty sure it would go over the heads of nearly everyone.He sells the idea that protecting the environment and reducing greenhouse gasses are ""faggy"" and ""Unamerican"". Failing to attend to global warming is mass suicide. That should not be the subject of FUD, even in comedy.Parker is a spoiled brat who is totally self absorbed. This is an utterly indulgent bit of nya-nyaing. May he be hit by a bus!",Team America - World Police

86,moviesleuth2,Consistently amusing and occasionally uproarious,6,16 November 2009,"A few years ago, I watched this movie alone, and while I thought that while it had some good spots, it ultimately wasn't that great. Then last night I popped it into the DVD player, and what do you know? I liked it a lot better.People have been really emphasizing the political satire in ""Team America: World Police."" While it's true that there is some of that, it's not wholly true. For the most part, it is a satire of the clichéd lame-brained action movies that fill up the multiplexes every summer. From the plot twists that are beyond cliché to the repetitive and clichéd (again) dialogue, nothing escapes the wrath of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. In fact, this is an almost line by line copy of ""G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra,"" if you can believe it (except that this one is openly satirical of movies like ""G.I. Joe."" The film opens with a Team America stopping a terrorist attack in Paris. In an overly-melodramatic scene, one member is killed, so a replacement must be found. That is Gary Johnston (Trey Parker), a Broadway star (he's the main character in ""Lease""). The team's boss, Spottswoode (Daran Norris) tells him that he has to act his way into a terrorist bar to find out where the terrorists are going to strike next. Meanwhile, Kim Jong-Il is pulling strings behind the scenes to arrange a ""peace meeting"" with the Film Actor's Guild (F.A.G.), but he has some ulterior motives.While I would admit that this may have been a more effective satire when George W. Bush was in power and Kim Jong-Il was the center of attention, it's still worth a few yuks. Politically, the film isn't liberal or republican; both are skewered equally well. Republicans (Team America) are depicted as policing the world and getting into everyone's business, regardless of cost or collateral damage. Liberals (F.A.G.) are depicted as idiots who have deluded themselves into thinking that all the world's problems can be solved by sitting down and talking problems out.With a movie like this, it's obvious that some people are going to be offended. That's the goal. Roger Ebert criticized it for its nihilism and saying that the events that the film spoofs don't matter. He's right, but he's also missing the point. ""Team America"" isn't satirizing the causes of the celebrities, it makes fun of how they go about it. As Parker and Stone see it, celebrities are championing causes in completely wrong ways. They simplify complex problems. These celebrities are actors and filmmakers, and not activists (While I don't totally agree with them on this, they do have a point in some cases. But satire is about exaggerating the big points; make it too complicated and it will collapse under its own weight). And certainly the MPAA didn't like it (they initially gave it an NC-17 rating for a very risqué sex scene between two puppets. I'm dead serious. Seeing the unrated version, I will say this: if these acts were performed with live actors, the rating may have made some sense. But with puppets (and its execution), it's so over-the-top in its ridiculousness that no one could possibly take it seriously (Actually, according the the trivia, many European ratings boards gave this film a family friendly rating).There is no doubt that ""Team America"" is an ambitious movie. And while I can laud it for that, as entertainment, it's merely passable. It's not what it does that's the problem, it's that there's not enough of it. The film has a few dead spots where it is riding on its satire of the mindless blockbusters. Parker and Stone uses over-exaggeration and intentionally clichéd lines to poke fun at these movies. While that works for a while, it gets old pretty quickly. ""Team America"" needs more inventiveness.I'd recommend it, but it's a movie to watch late at night with a bunch of friends and over a couple of beers.",Team America - World Police
87,movieguy1021,Team America: World Police: 7/10,7,16 October 2004,"I wasn't alive during the Cold War, so I cannot accurately judge the effect that Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb had on the public when it was released. I can, however, accurately say that for the most part that Team America: World Police is a Dr. Strangelove for this generation. In the midst of the ""war on terror"", a movie satirizing it with a bunch of terrorist-fighting marionettes killing every outspoken Hollywood celebrity. And while Dr. Strangelove wasn't nearly as graphic, it's still making fun of the situation as the situation's going on, as Team America does. How does Team America do it? By graphic humor and action-movies clichés, what else?Team America, a division of the government, go and stop terrorism wherever it happens. They'll stop at nothing to defeat terrorists, including destroying cities (now isn't that an obvious political statement?). To go even more undercover, Team America hires the up-and-coming actor Gary Johnston to act as a terrorist. A big terrorist scheme is coming aground, led by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il. Gary's initially reluctant to go about this plan, but he realizes that helping the world is more important than his career. Will Team America stop the terrorists in time?This is attempt #10 we're seeing. Nine previous versions of the movie were submitted to the MPAA, all of which were rated NC-17. Some of the more graphic puppet sex had to be taken out, meaning that the ""love making"" scene was reduced to a ""sex"" scene, according to creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I doubt that three times the length of the sex scene would have made it ""love making"", but that shows the absurdity of the movie, and once you hear about the sex scene, you realize what movie you're going to see. You're going to see graphic puppet sex, blood and guts, and hear strong language. I'm not a big fan of the TV show South Park, and I thought that the movie version of it was mediocre, too. And, like the South Park movie, Team America does have some truly uproarious bits. The opening scene in Paris really takes the cake. The movie as a whole didn't have those huge laughs that the trailers made you expect, but quite a few moments made you chuckle. But Team America is just not a political satire. It's also a huge send-up of action movies, especially of the Jerry Bruckheimer kind. In fact, one song in the movie (that's right, there's songs) is called ""Pearl Harbor Sucked and I Miss You."" There's a lot of random explosions, cheesy clichés, celebrity cameos, and everything. The Hollywood satire is almost as great as the political satire.Every Hollywood liberal is brought in, including some I didn't know had a political agenda (Sam Jackson and Ethan Hawke?). Some of the more obvious ones, like Alec Baldwin (Parker and Stone also made fun of the Baldwins in the South Park movie) and Sean Penn, are primarily featured, because they're easily made fun of. And watching all of these actors in action at the end of the film is priceless. There's some very memorable moments in here (such as Hans Blix being eaten alive by sharks or Kim Jong Il singing ""I'm So Ronrey""), but once the first 20 minutes are done, there's no real constant laughs. It's bits and pieces, some obvious things, but sometimes so crude you can't help laughing. But once the novelty of seeing the puppets act dies down, it's just a typical movie, seemingly. Sure, some crazy things do happen, but I think you'll realize what I mean when you see it.Still, you have to admire Parker and Stone for having the grapes to make a movie like this at a time like this. While I'm sure it won't be as lasting or as widely accepted as Dr. Strangelove was at its time, but they both have similar themes, and if you're for some good satire, along with some extreme crudity, then Team America's your movie.My rating: 7/10Rated R for graphic crude and sexual humor, violent images and strong language - all involving puppets.",Team America - World Police

89,Eumenides_0,"Funny, Witty Satire On Everything",7,21 February 2005,"'Team America: World Police' is one of the best satires in modern cinema! Matt Stone and Trey Parker have matured a lot since the days of 'South Park' and it shows in this movie: it has more coherence, its jokes are more mature although the creators never mind indulging in gratuitous gore and scatological images, and the satire is sharper and more purpose-driven than in their previous movie. And they did it all with puppets! I love the way they spare no one and take no sides  Republicans and Democrats are both get it, terrorists are ridiculed, Kim Jong Il finally receives some spotlight; I'm glad someone finally realised Saddam isn't half the threat this mad dictator in North Korea is, and perhaps this movie will educate some about it after all. This movie made my wish come true of seeing Michael Moore blown up to pieces, even if it were just a puppet: I hate this guy although we both agree on politics, but he just seems too eager to be under the lime lights all the time, and besides he makes very crappy, partial documentaries, manipulating facts when these should be objective. And not even Hollywood actors were spared. This might confuse many people, since the impression the filmmakers give is that they hate Penn and Robbins just because they're left-wingers. I think their problem is that they're just Americans.In Europe there's some tolerance when an actor or writer or artist speaks out about politics; there's no reason to suppose they're not as well-informed as actual politicians. But in the USA it seems it doesn't look right when actors talk about politics, even if they're intelligent people like Tim Robbins who's made some good political movies. So they fall victim to satires like this; it seems even intelligent people like Parker and Stone missed that. Of course one should what then gives Trey and Parker to mess with politics, too? Even so, the jokes involving the actors were brilliant: Kim Jong Il's depending on the acting skills of Alec Baldwin to gather the world leaders in his palace, Gary's line to Susan Sarandon about her losing her acting skills, Gary's fear of out-performing Baldiwn because 'he's the greatest actor in the world,' they were all brilliant! Nothing beats Kim Jong Il singing in his palace, though.This is a musical and all the songs are witty and tongue-in-cheek: 'I'm So Ronery' was obviously brilliant. The joke on Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer was priceless: the 'Pearl Harbor' song will remain in my mind for life! It's funny and completely true  Cuba Gooding Jr. did deserve a bigger role in 'Pearl Harbor.' My favourite is 'Montage,' a brilliant piece of meta criticism on the art of film-making and a parody of montage-type scenes like the one where Gary goes from a wimp to a super soldier in two minutes 'Even Rocky had a montage' indeed! I wasn't expecting much from this movie besides mindless fun in the sense 'South Park' was mindless fun to me. But 'Team America: World Police' is actually quite clever and witty satire. Parker and Stone have promised never to work with puppets again, which is a pity, they're hilarious, but I hope they can outdo themselves with their next movie! These two brilliant filmmakers just seem to get better and better.",Team America - World Police
90,OriginalMovieBuff21,"""America......F*ck yea!!""",10,11 September 2005,"Team America: World Police was one of the first movies I wanted to see in 2004, but never had the time to see it. So I finally rented it last night and watched it. The movie is hilarious on all levels. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are excellent comedians who are the creators behind South Park. There were a couple scenes in the movie that made me die laughing such as the puppet sex scene, the Korean ruler's song ""I am so lonely"", the killing of the actors guild, and many others. How the puppets moved, talked, and killed was hilarious. Nearly the whole movie I laughed. Overall, Team America: World Police is an enjoyable satire that is highly entertaining . Trey Parker and Matt Stone are good! I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+",Team America - World Police
91,Antagonisten,Great musical elements,7,10 October 2006,"I love ""South Park"" and of course my expectations for this movie were quite high. The question though was if Trey Parker and Matt Stone could deliver in the medium of puppets instead of cartoons, personally i wasn't thrilled at the idea of a puppet movie.All in all i have to say they did deliver. The whole puppet thing still feels unnecessary but it's very well made and funny in a way. The main thing though, as always with Parker and Stone, is the musical elements. I don't know anyone who can make musical comedy like they can. Not only do they make it hilarious, but their songs are really great - if the lyrics were more well-adjusted they would definitely fit in a ""real"" musical. There are several songs here that are instant classics, like the ""main theme"" that goes ""America - f*ck yeah"", and the song ""I'm so lonely"" performed by the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il.The thing that is also very refreshing is the fact that Parker and Stone kick in all directions in this movie, no side or opinion is left untouched. Of course that can be considered lame as well, not making a stand. But i liked it since usually every side of an issue has something to ridicule. Also strongly political movies have never appealed to me, and South Park to me has always been about pointing out crap ideas no matter who comes up with them.' So, if you can take a few F-words, a little puppet-sex and of course a lot of music with dirty lyrics, this might just be for you. If you are intensely politically correct, sensitive or such you might want to stay away. But seeing as Trey Parker and Matt Stone are behind this you probably knew that already. 7/10.",Team America - World Police
92,elicopperman,Hysterical Action Satire from the South Park Guys,5,17 September 2021,"While general audiences may know comedic icons Trey Parker & Matt Stone for creating cultural phenomenons like South Park and The Book of Mormon, one notable experiment of theirs is the Supermarionated black comedy action film, Team America: World Police. Satirizing big budget action films with all of the cliches and political mumbo jumbo that come in the package, the film was a modest box office hit and was generally praised by critics and audiences, mainly from those who are more familiar with Parker & Stone's sense of humor. But looking back on the film itself, let's see if it was able to hang by all of its strings.The film follows Broadway actor Gary Johnson, who is recruited by a paramilitary police force that's trying to stop North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il from plotting global destruction. As a satire on the absurdities in big blockbuster action flicks, as well as the cult classic puppet series Thunderbirds, much of the humor derives from how silly many of these films can be when they take themselves too seriously. As a result, a lot of the comedy ends up rather hit or miss depending on whoever may end up laughing or feeling dumbfounded. Not to mention, since this movie relies on said cliches to drive the story forward, its plot does expose itself as otherwise rather formulaic. One notable implication is how much the film goes hard on liberal activism in Hollywood actors, which showcases Parker & Stone's strength in poking fun at the elite becoming a part of something without making much of a difference in the grand scheme of things. It's clear that the filmmakers intended to offend as many people as possible while keeping their main target intact, even if not all of their targets hit the mark.Not to mention, the biggest double edged sword about the movie is that in spite of its intent to parody action movies, it ends up making most of the characters just that: parodies. Gary is the special chosen one that must save the world with his power (a.k.a. Acting), Lisa is Gary's crush who's having a hard time falling in love again due to her tragic past, Chris is the stern tough guy who never trusts Gary, Sarah is also in love with Gary, Joe is in love with Sarah, and Spottswoode is Team America's mechanical leader. The characters themselves are by no means unlikable, but given how much the film would rather lampoon its subject matter instead of making them fully relatable characters, they end up as one dimensional as any other fighting team. Oddly enough, the most memorable character in the movie is Kim Jong-il. He is so over the top evil and goofy that he practically steals the show, especially in a beautiful expositionary song entitled ""I'm Ronery"", which surprisingly holds up in today's era of ignorance. Feels like a breath of fresh air from a cast of tropes disguised as actual characters.As for other production values, given that this film utilizes special marionettes, one can tell how much craft and effort was put on screen. In addition to the famed Chiodo brothers putting together some nicely stylized puppets with realistic albeit uncanny features, the limited nature of the puppets' motion adds in to more of the gags, especially when they're all being maneuvered by janky strings. Parker & Stone later went on record stating that making the film was the hardest task of their careers given the puppet's being impossible to work on command, hence why there was probably more improv and rewritten dialogue than intended during shooting. In addition, the sets and props are very well set up to the point where the film really does feel like a cinematic puppet show, along with the occasional special effects, compositing trick and even real animals to punch up the effect in a given scene. The best thing the film arguably nailed as an action parody is how much care and detail were put into creating the aesthetic of a legitimate action thrill ride. Talk about doing the most with what you have.Lastly, if there's anything worth noting as a major highlight in the movie, it would hands down be the soundtrack. Most if not all of the songs contribute to both the lampooning of action movies and specific scenes that happen in the movie. After starting off with the 80s Broadway spectacle inspired Everyone Has AIDS, the film then spoofs dramatic sequences with Freedom Isn't Free and the high obtained momentum in 80s & 90s sports flicks with Montage. While the latter can be a bit repetitive with what they're getting at, the better musical numbers really hit the mark when they're appropriately exaggerating the scene, such as the stupidly awesome cult favorite America, F Yeah, the love scene parody Only a Woman, and the well staged albeit hysterical North Korean Melody. Arguably the worst one might be The End of an Act, which beats a dead horse to a pulp in comparing loving someone to hating Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. In addition to the goofy looking albeit well crafted effects, the one thing worth cherishing from this crazy endeavor would be at least one of these songs.As it stands today, it's a good thing Team America: World Police merely remains Trey Parker & Matt Stone experimenting with an unconventional form of filmmaking to stretch out their comedy skills. While it has great intentions and a lot of hard work and effort paid off, even those two would agree that this was a one and done endeavor that at least offered some hearty laughs and a buttkicking soundtrack. I would mainly recommend this to big fans of Parker & Stone's work and anyone over the age of 18 that's into lampooned action movies, since this is definitely an acquired taste, but a fascinating one nonetheless.",Team America - World Police
93,MichaelMargetis,The Funniest Film of 2004 - Period!,9,8 May 2005,"From the sick and very twisted creators of the hit animated program South Park on Comedy Central, comes an even more depraved feature, acted out by puppets titled Team America: World Police. This time around, Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the film's creators) are poking fun at all new people -- including terrorists, Kim Jong Il and most of all loud mouth celebrities who voice their political opinions. Most of the time the creators go after Republican conservatives, but this time around they swing the piñata bat at the Democrat liberal entertainers...and boy, do they swing! Sean Penn has already expressed a memo of hate towards the comic duo for their portrayal of him being an idiot for going to Iraq last Christmas, and if that isn't enough controversy behind the film, the creators had to edit out over twenty minutes of the finished product for it to escape the NC-17 rating.My response to Team America: World Police was more positive then I could have ever imagined. When I was walking into the 300 seat theater, I thought I would only get a minimal amount of laughs out of it. I was sorely mistaking! I came out of the theater with a sore throat from laughing so much and so hard. The movie is easily one of the best films of the year so far, not to mention the funniest by a long shot. Although I fell in love with it's charm and amazingly vulgar sense of humor, many critics and Hollywood types alike will pan it. The reason being is the film is pretty much a personal attack on them. When the film makes it over seas to North Korea, it will surely be banned for mocking their leader Kim Jong Il. It's my guess Il won't appreciate himself being portrayed as a ruthless foul-mouthed dictator hell-bent on world domination who can't pronounce the word ""inevitable"". Besides Il, Alec Baldwin will be angered at the South Park guys making him out to be, well... Alec Baldwin.In conclusion, Team America: World Police not only gives Hollywood, terrorists, socialists and activists the good ribbing they deserve, but it also is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and perhaps even the funniest movie I've ever seen. During the course of the one hour and forty minute runtime Trey Parker and Matt Stone manage to make fun of: Ben Affleck, Alec Baldwin, Hans Blitz, George W. Bush, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Janeane Garofolo, Danny Glover, Helen Hunt, Kim Jong II, John Kerry, Michael Moore, Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Jennings, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Michael Sheen, the American government, Americans, the French, the Panamanians, the North Koreans, Middle-Easterns, Egyptians, the Broadway play Rent and everyone who had anything to do with the film 'Pearl Harbor'.

I had actually waited to see it and a few friends (who are bigger South Park fans than me) said they liked it but it got a bit monotonous.

In fact that's where I think the writers truly nailed it - the script works just as a damn funny parody of all the ""rag-tag teams brought together to fight injustice"" movies. And I actually was impressed with the marionettes - beautiful work and yet also having fun with ALL the stuff they Couldn't pull off very well (like big fight scenes). So, I laughed - a lot.

I think ""South Park"" has the potential to be funny, but it largely consists of the same jokes repeated ad nauseum. I went to see ""The Book of Mormon"" and walked out during the intermission. Other than this film, the only project of theirs that I haven't disliked is ""Cannibal: The Musical"". I think this one succeeds for me where others have failed because it's operating on two levels. It's a typical Parker/Stone political satire and also a knowing satire of big, dumb action films. While the former only works intermittently for me (when it does work, it works extremely well), the latter is consistently funny and carries me through this one. I would add ... while I'm not a big fan of their particular brand of political satire, I like their ability to annoy just about everyone.",Team America - World Police
98,majikstl,A Lovingly Crafted Display of Utter Contempt...,1,24 October 2004,"There are two schools of outrageous humor: the class clown and the class bully. Both seem to think that nothing is sacred, but the class clown shares the joke: it is at everyone's expense, including his own. The class bully targets others; the more vulnerable, the better. The class clown delights in saying outrageously offensive things in a way that doesn't quite offend anyone. For the class bully, offending is part of the joke. People share the jokes of the class clown, while the class bully is frequently heard saying ""C'mon, man, it's just a joke!"" It's the difference between MAD Magazine and the National Lampoon; between Carol Burnett and Sandra Bernhard; between Groucho Marx and Adam Sandler. It is the difference between AIRPLANE! and TEAM AMERlCA: WORLD POLICE. TEAM AMERlCA is, of course, the handiwork of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the guys who inflicted ""South Park"" on a poor unsuspecting world. They are class bullies: spoiled brats with a schoolyard mentality and a frat house sense of casual contempt. They create humor for people who think that the mere insertion of the ""f"" word into any sentence automatically makes it funny; who think shouting obscenities at total strangers from a passing car is a hoot; who think defacing public restroom walls with profane drawings is self expression. When someone coined the phrase ""nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public,"" they were foreshadowing the careers of Stone and Parker. With their seminal work ""South Park,"" they took the idea of using an animated series about very small children to use as a vehicle to express their misanthropy, homophobia and general contempt for authority and innocence -- sort of a cross between ""Peanuts"" and ""Hustler"" magazine. In addition to giving the animated children profanity laced dialogue, the show's weekly running gag is to have a child violently die. There is something sad ... no, pathetic about grown men who think destroying innocence is a sign of maturity. TEAM AMERlCA was conceived as a send up of the type of films that producers like Jerry Bruckheimer routinely churn out; loud, obnoxious, testosterone-driven, special effects laden, blockbusters that have little to offer but loud explosions and empty heroics, like CON AIR, THE ROCK, ARMAGEDD0N and INDEPENDENCE DAY. Such films are already self-parodies, and were already very well parodied by Zucker, Abrahams & Zucker in their two HOT SHOTS movies. TEAM AMERlCA is obviously modeled in the AIRPLANE!/HOT SHOTS style, and as you watch TEAM AMERlCA you realize how the jokes might have actually been funny had they been presented with AIRPLANE!'s sense of giddy goofiness rather than with Parker and Stone's sense of snide contempt. The only thing that Parker and Stone really bring to the mix is that TEAM AMERlCA is told using marionettes, a rather silly and pointless gesture, but a revealing one. It is their trademark, I suppose, to take something generally considered to be innocent and childlike -- cartoons, puppets, etc. -- and dirtying it up. To it's credit, TEAM AMERlCA is extremely well made. The marionettes are skillfully crafted and well animated, the set miniatures are remarkably detailed and the whole enterprise is beautifully filmed. It is obvious that a lot of people worked very hard to make a film that looked special. It is a shame that all their work came about so that, basically, Parker and Stone could urinate on it. It seems that it is part of their modus operandi: take something nice and try to ruin it for everybody. Again, they are the bullies who can't build a sandcastle, so they delight in running along the beach and kicking in everybody else's. The puppetry is the film's only asset; even though it is also the film's only joke. But it is a weak joke at that. What little amusement there is to be had by watching puppets shooting machine guns and spouting obscene dialogue is long gone by the time Parker and Stone get to the supposedly humorous scenes of puppets simulating sex acts, spurting blood, being dismembered or left lying in pools of vomit. Some people might argue that the use of puppets is a political statement, a stroke of genius designed to show how others are used and manipulated -- though the only ones being used and manipulated here are the people who would defend this vacuous trash.For all of its elaborate efforts, it is remarkable just how little ambition there is in TEAM AMERlCA's satire. It vaguely mocks patriotism and the right by suggesting that the more America tries to play ""world police"" the more damage it does. The film is more open in its hatred for the left, showing contempt for actors in general and politically active actors in particular. The attacks on celebrities like Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Helen Hunt, Tim Robbins, Alec Baldwin and a host of others are not intended to be good natured kidding but viciously vindictive. And while some celebrities are overdue to be taken down a notch or two, how hypocritical is it to castigate other celebrities for using their fame to promote their ideals, when Parker and Stone frequently justify their forays into bad taste by claiming it carries a political message? No matter how ill informed or foolish some activist/actors may appear, at least they are sincere. For Parker and Stone, political idealism is something to be exploited or mocked. Again, they're like class bullies sitting on the sidelines ridiculing the squares running for class president. It is worth noting, I think, that the film's pseudo-inspirational, pseudo-patriotic theme song ""America, F*#& Yeah!"" sounds undeniably like ""America, F*#& You!"" And that, more or less, is the only thing that Trey Parker and Matt Stone ever really do say.",Team America - World Police
99,peefyn,Typical Stone & Parker satire - in a good way,7,30 April 2017,"I love the fact that they made this a marionette film. It's beautifully executed, in that they both highlight how it's a craft that can be done well, but also highlighting it in its awkwardness. They respect the strings, but never go out of their way to hide them. This alone is a good reason to watch this movie.That said, it's also a fun satire, done in the juvenile way that Trey Parker and Matt Stone has perfected. There's not layers upon layers to dig through of meaning, but there is a heart in the movie that's integrated into the crude jokes about sex and violence. By lowering our expectations, they manage to open us up to (something like) a moral reflection when we least expect it. They've done this for years on South Park, and it works just as well here. It's even true for their musical, The Book of Mormon.It's also a delight how they're able to poke fun at pretty much everything, and how they're able to do in a technically interesting format. Even though I like South Park, I wish they would spend more time on projects like this.",Team America - World Police
100,EthanBJones_03,America! **** YEAH!,8,5 July 2017,"'TEAM America: WORLD POLICE' was directed by and stars Trey Parker, but also stars Matt Stone and Kristen Miller.​When North Korean ruler Kim Jong-il (Trey Parker) orchestrates a global terrorist plot, it's up to the heavily armed marionettes of the highly specialised Team America unit to stop his dastardly scheme. The group, which includes the thespian-averse technology expert Chris (Matt Stone), not only has to face off against Jong-il, but they must also contend with F.A.G., the Film Actors Guild, a cadre of Hollywood liberals at odds with Team America's ""policing the world"" tactics.If Matt and Trey know how to do one thing, it's make genius satire. And that is exactly what this movie is. I've already given the title of my favourite satire ever to 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' but this movie definitely comes close. I recommend you watch the opening sequence of this movie. Like what you see? Carry on, treat yourself. If not then you won't like the rest of the film. I don't know what more I can say about the movie. Go try and see it. You might enjoy yourself.That said, I may as well comment on the various other aspects of it. The story for this movie is pure brilliance. I cannot flaw the spectacular satire at all and it is truly remarkable. Every line of dialogue is taking the mick and the movie relishes in that. It knows exactly what it is and takes it in full stride. If you want to watch this movie for a pure, unfiltered raunchy laugh - you'll get what you payed for. If you wanna analyse the nitty-gritty and discover hidden meaning - you'll get what you payed for. The script is so open and so brilliant that I cannot congratulate Parker and Stone any more for their spectacular ability to write.Each character in this movie is memorable. That is yet another strength of the dynamic duo. They all have distinguished personalities that also fall into the American stereotype. It's brilliant! The villains represent everything America hates and that is also genius. Nothing in this movie is wasted, it all means something and that is the reason it deserved all the acclaim it gets.People complain about the animation style but I love it. It's fun, it's goofy and they precautions in creating immersion but that is what makes it great. I've used the word brilliant a lot already but I don't think I'm being too kind. Parker and Stone know exactly how to use animation for comedy and they perfected it again here. This movie is funny, it's got great satire, it's interesting, the character's are great, the animation style is unique - it's great. Please, watch at least the first 10 minutes. If you laugh or smile even once, finish the film. If not, don't finish it. Chances are that you'll hate it and then go onto complain about it. I recommend this movie, and will rate it a patriotic 8 MERICAS out of 10. Side Note - I watched this movie on the 4th of July by complete accident. This is the perfect example of the stars aligning to bring joy to the world.",Team America - World Police

I love how many things it takes blows at and I love how it has all the balls it wants to have and goes wherever the hell it wants to go. The characters all kick mad ass, the songs are hilarious, the dialogue is amazing, the THEORIES like the one about d***s, pussies, and a***oles is pure genius. I have a new respect for Trey Parker after seeing this and will probably begin to collect all of his movies now.Anyone who doesn't like it is simply way too vaginal and takes things way too seriously. I'm glad someone has similar views with me on politics and wars of the world...and I'm glad that it's Trey Parker and Matt Stone of all people. This is what memorable comedies are all about...taking things to a new height, taking things to a new level.

102,christian123,Disappointing but there are some funny moments,5,27 May 2005,"Team America: World Police has a funny premise but its not as funny as I was expecting it to be. A third world dictator is supposedly selling ""weapons of mass destruction"" to terrorists, which means its up to Team America, the global police force, to save the day! But first, they must recruit a rising Broadway star to go undercover in the hideout of the power mad Kim Jong Il. People will no doubt be insulted by the film and if you think your one of those people, then its better if you just skip this film. Team America: World Police is a rather disappointing comedy. I'm not saying its awful, its just not belly aching funny. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are both pretty funny and clever guys and they do a good job with this film. While the puppet thing may be original, its starts wearing out and it loses its effect. The movie makes fun of a lot of people including world leaders and celebrities. They do the celebrities all right except for Matt Damon as his puppet looked nothing like him and he acted really retarded. The movie starts off well but it later becomes rather boring. The jokes are reused throughout the film and the third time you hear the same thing you start wondering if there's going to be anything else. The voices are done pretty well for all the other characters. The running time is only 97 minutes long but it feels a lot longer. The ending also drags a bit and I was a bit happy when it finally ended. I would pick South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut over Team America as it was funnier. Maybe I just didn't get the joke so you should see if for yourself unless you know your going to be offended and all your going to do is complain about how offensive it is. In the end, this comedy is a little overrated but still worth checking out now that its out on video. Rating 6/10, average comedy.",Team America - World Police
103,kgprophet,I don't know whether to be appalled or amused,6,21 October 2004,"In that case Parker & Stone have me right where they want. The outrageous idea of making a Jerry Brukheimer movie with puppets is quite inspired. If Brukheimer was smart, he would give them an action movie deal right away. So dead on are the cliché plot lines, the music, the dialogue, the over-the-top effects, you feel like you are actually watching the real thing. Except in this case it is literally wooden acting. Despite obvious attacks on some celebrities, the humour is consistent enough to enjoy, whether you think Michael Moore hates America or not. Team America is the wet dream of neo-cons. They spread freedom through bullets and rockets. One thing you have to hand to Parker & Stone, is that they have carte blanche on any taboo subject, and don't have to answer to anybody. Each new episode of South Park tries to outdo the last in being repulsive and tasteless, and I can't wait until the next one.Some might say that Parker/Stone are ushering in the era of trash humour. But if it's this funny, then who cares! Like similar reviews, I agree that more attempts should've been made to lampoon the cheesy dialogue and plot, instead of merely mimicking. But I'll take this over ""White Chicks"" any day. I give it 6 out of 10.",Team America - World Police

106,TheMarwood,A wonderfully crafted puppet freakshow,8,13 November 2014,"Back in 2004 Team America rode a tidal wave of controversial hype to theaters, where it quickly vanished off screens. A grueling production and a rushed post production to meet a silly release date timed for election season, keeps Team America from being as tightly edited as it should. It runs about 15 minutes too long and needs some tinkering, but as sloppy as the film can get, it's sheer audacity as not only a technical accomplishment but as a deranged satire is something to behold. The last thing I was expecting from Trey Parker was a meticulously crafted film - something hilarious, of course - but not brilliant cinematography, well lit models and well staged action, while skewering the visuals of Bruckheimer productions. Even if a particular joke falls flat, I find it hard not to still have a smile on my face from watching absurd puppets in absurd sets - the whole film is a visual gag. While Parker and Stone certainly mine laughs at the expense of self righteous actors, the gags worked best as a TV newscast punchline, but turning that punchline into a last act plot thread doesn't fully work. The screenplay never really finds its footing, but my criticisms are dwarfed by the fact that just looking at the film makes me laugh out loud.",Team America - World Police

As long as you can handle swearing, and I for do not like it when its inappropriate or artificially inserted for no point, but in this case its required. Some of the sexual acts are not easy to watch, but a few beers will solve that and while my wife found some unpleasant as well, she still loved the movie as a whole and I often hear her sing one of the songs from the movie occasionally.

109,jldmp1,Unexpurgated Thunderbirds,5,2 April 2006,"The ""South Park"" lads may well know that the short form of their crude satire is played out -- the feature length movie has already been used, and the visual narrative can't go anywhere else in 2-D. So what to do when there are so many targets left to blow up?Naturally, you think about using a different medium -- the live acting in ""Baseketball"" didn't connect, so that leaves CGI, puppets/marionettes, or claymation to choose from. I don't think we've seen ""Thunderbirds"" marionettes since that Dire Straits video ""Calling Elvis"", and that was 1992. So a generation later, the possibilities are wide open. In choosing puppets you gain the one big advantage of simply freaking out the audience by appearances alone, which sounds to me like it's just up their alley. Then add the usual crassness and barn door sized targets and you have a recipe for some REAL fun.The fans won't care about this, but it has to be said that the cinematic qualities are dead on...they've created an alternate three-D world, that's all about making fun of movie-making (think montages, actors/self-important leftist ""F.A.G.""s, career climbing, inflated causes du jour). The stance and movement of the camera eye itself shows knowledge of how to film in dimensions.On the other hand, the actual material of the visual narrative is clumsy and unrefined. There isn't one convincing hand-to-hand fight scene, for instance...little better than Punch and Judy, actually.The ""Wallace and Gromit"" paradigm is still a better solution for manufacturing a world and a visual vocabulary.",Team America - World Police

However, there are some problems: the dolls used in the film look a bit uncanny and ugly, which made me a little uncomfortable and there are many severe flaws in the film, including some exaggerated characterizations of certain individuals that can be significantly offensive.Overall, I found it to be a quite funny but flawed comedy.

114,MovieCriticMarvelfan,Funniest movie in a long time,9,28 October 2004,"Wow, This is a hilarious movie, probably one of the funniest American movies I have ever seen. Bringing in the use of puppets as used by other series like ""The Thunderbirds"" , Matt Stone and Trey Parker have hit gold with this movie. Wow where do I start. Originally Trey Park and Matt Stone were set to direct a spoof of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but that plan was soon removed. They then decided to make ""Team America World Police"" released by Paramount. This is a movie that is undergoing such buzz in Hollywood and has gotten worldwide attention among movie fans, clearly this is a movie that is unique. Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done what other directors have failed to do in the last few years, used a funny movie to create great satire centering on todays corrupt politics, and worldview ,not to mention our over emphasis fear on ""Terrorism"" and American ideals. The movie main plot is that a group of Americans are part of a secret police that well polices the world under the name ""Team America"" lol Well they hunt down terrorist like Osama Bin Laden and others while acting as diplomatically incorrect as possible. The scene which spoofs Hans Blitzer a weapons inspector against Korean Dictaor Mr. Cho is hilarious. While Matt and Trey obviously are not trying to make a political movie, they obviously gives us their interpretation of what not only goes on in the mind of a terrorist, but the corrupt and often nonexistent plans that the US has in getting these terrorist. Speaking of which the first frame of the movie is pure comedy as the Team America within a span of five minutes are able to track down Osama Bin Laden, something the poor and disorganized Administration of George Bush and the military has failed to do since September 11 Of course theirs spoofs of movies like the Matrix with the Team America often battling with hilarious, over the top martial arts kicks and punches, but its all done with such lack of precision that you cant help but die laughing at the screen. The movie while undergoing tremendous success at the box office and praise from fans, has gotten many cheapshots from many so called professional critics who are anything but professional. Roger Ebert said the movie was nihilistic , lame and that Trey and Matt'ss attempt was to make fun of ""anyone who cares about the war"" like Sean Penn. Yet Ebert doesn't mention that spoiled celebrities like Sean Penn and Alec Baldwin who say they ""care"" about the war have an agenda and are using the war to clean their image. Richard Roper on the other hand, gave a great review, calling it a great piece of satire and that he enjoyed the jokes. However, Trey and Matt also give a nice ode to the troops in America by the song delivered ""Freedom isn't Free"".Freedom is not free many Americans died for our Freedom and we should never forget that, if it wasn't for the sacrifices of others, we wouldn't have the world we have today. Overall though , ""Team America World Police"" from the creators of South Park is absolutely funny that has to be seen over and over again. I can see a couple of months down the line that DVD release of this movie like Fahrenheit 911 is sure to be a huge hit, so see this funny movie now.",Team America - World Police
115,D_Burke,Absolutely Brilliant- Funny in So Many Unexpected Ways,9,26 September 2008,"""Team America: World Police"" hit the mark in so many ways. It was part political satire, part vulgar comedy, part action film spoof (particularly Jerry Bruckheimer films), and part Thunderbirds/Saturday morning kids' show parody. It was all funny, and all brilliant, too.I'm not certain that I went into this movie with high expectations. The only expectation I had was that it was going to be funny. After all, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut"" was, and still is, hilarious. Both these movies from the creators of ""South Park"" exceeded my expectations for being funny, and also still merit a sequel.For one, the special effects were brilliant. I have no idea how the maker's of this movie made the characters' mouths or eyes move, but it was done so flawlessly that I wished some G-rated kids movies would put in more effort. The detail on all the puppets, especially the celebrities who were brutally skewered in this movie, both literally and figuratively, was also well done. It is surprising that this movie was not nominated for any Oscars, let alone for special effects. I personally am a big fan of animation, and I know brilliance when I see it. This movie was most certainly of high quality, and didn't get the accolades it deserved.The movie was just spot on with everything it was spoofing. I heard that a lot of people thought it would parody the Bush Administration and its War on Terror, which it did to an extent. Actually, none of the Bush administration was mentioned in the movie. What was unexpected to many was the equal slamming of the left, particularly the Hollywood actors who became activists in 2004. I will admit that changing the Screen Actor's Guild to the Film Actor's Guild solely for making its initials ""F.A.G."" was the weakest running gag of the movie. Homophobia isn't funny anymore, and a lot of comedy writer's don't seem to grasp that, including Matt Stone & Trey Parker. However, I loved the spoofing of Hollywood actors such as Tim Robbins and Sean Penn. No one really made fun of them as brilliantly as Stone & Parker did before the release of this movie. I'm a moderate liberal myself, and I found it very funny. I wasn't offended in the slightest.Having said that, there are probably a lot of people out there who would find this movie offensive. After all, there is a lot of swearing, a lot of bloodshed (even in a movie about puppets), and the notorious gratuitous sex scene. It was hilarious because it was all over the top. As long as you expect this movie to be over the top, you probably won't get offended.Also, fans of action movies, particularly Jerry Bruckheimer movies, may not like this film as much either. I'm not sure how many Bruckheimer fans there actually are out there, although I'm guessing just a few. Although I like some of Bruckheimer's films, including ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", and ""Con Air"", others of his films really had it coming. That's why I laughed so hard at the song ""'Pearl Harbor' Sucked, and I Love You"". I couldn't agree more.Like the ""South Park"" movie, the songs in this film were funny, and of very high quality. Again, at least one of them should have been nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars that year. If one could have been nominated, it probably should have been ""I'm So Ronery"" by Kim Jong-Il. That song was funny, but surprisingly poignant, and I would have liked to have heard what the real Kim Jong-Il would have thought about it.There's really not a lot to say about this film that was bad. I had one qualm with a tasteless joke, but everything else was well executed. The writing was great, the jokes were gut-bustingly hilarious, the spoofing was top notch, and the production was phenomenal. I am highly recommending this film to all fans of good movies, animation, and well-executed comedy, provided you're at a mature age.",Team America - World Police

117,Gubby-Allen,Funny?,4,2 October 2006,"We watched this on DVD, none of us laughed once so it wasn't until I came on here, that I was even aware that it was supposedly a comedy. Despite that and also despite the fact that what little I have seen of South Park, I have found it about as funny as a road accident, I didn't dislike this film & hacked it through to the end.A big plus for me was how refreshing it was to see a film written from a slightly right-of-centre perspective and the mocking of Michael Moore and the actors on the Loony side of the left was long, long overdue.I certainly wouldn't call this film right wing. It was very anti-both those on the left or the extreme right, as I am & are most people with any sense or knowledge. It was merely that the mocking & verbal attacks targetted at those above who side themselves with the 'Stop The West Coalition' were far more subtle but there was plenty in this film to attack those of a right wing persuasion who think the worlds problems are solved by blowing nations to smithereens. But that was more ironical & you just had to look a little harder & have more knowledge of world affairs to recognise it. The whole essence of the film suited the left wing ideology. Team America - World Police - a unwritten tag seemingly self appointed by loathsome U.S governments over the last few decades, was a blatant ironic attack on the current administration.Some of the songs were good, the montage song excellent & cleverly written, but overall, I just couldn't ever believe that the majority of those laughing & even enjoying this film were doing it for the right reasons.I think the popularity can be placed down to a younger audience giggling at the F-word every 10 seconds, puppets having sex & actors & world leaders they may have heard of (but know little about) being blown up in a graphic manner rather than the irony behind some of the film. It baffles me that some of those who (for reasons I can't fathom) worship Michael Moore's films at the same time celebrate him & those of his ilk - quite rightly - getting tiny some form of public comeuppance.There will be exceptions to this & apologies to those who familiar with Kim Jong Il, Hans Blix & Chechnyans, but they must be few & far between.In summary, not bad but not very good. Not in the slightest bit amusing, but worth a watch for some clever songs, occasional pieces of irony & satire and an equal bashing of those on the political right AND left. the latter of which was the highlight of the film & long overdue.Although, there may be irony in that too with the film poking fun at the warped view of the left from those on the right.4/10",Team America - World Police
118,basrutten,Misses the mark more often than Team America hits famous landmarks,6,25 February 2005,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge South Park fan, so I was quite looking forward to this movie. After having seen it, it leaves me with mixed feelings. ""Team America"" is definitely a movie with some good qualities, but they tend to get lost a bit amidst an avalanche of toilet humor and half-baked satire.First, let's cover the really good things. This is one of the only puppets films that have been made in recent history, and I think this aspect worked out great. Parker and Stone takes puppets to new heights (or lows, depending on your point of view), making them vomit, have sex, blow up into pieces and much more. It's silly, it looks awkward, but it certainly is fun to see.Next, ""Team America"" makes some brilliant fun of contemporary action movies. Every action movie cliché imaginable is spoofed by exaggerating it enormously and just about every line of dialog is either meaningless, pretentious, or both. For the most part this works well, especially during some hilarious songs that spoof Pearl Harbor, Rocky, and much more. On the other hand, the spoofing is so frequent and thorough that it gets boring way before the end, and since everything is so hollow and pretentious, it's hard to care about any of the characters of about what is going on.Where the movie also fails somewhat is in the satire department. While the movie attacks just about anything and everything, it seems to do it almost for the sake of it, while hardly ever making a good point. Most of the satire is either uncalled for, or just not sharp enough (couldn't they think of anything better to ridicule Micheal Moore than this?), or largely pointless.What also doesn't help is that many of the humor is really, really juvenile. I know this is similar to South Park, but there the main characters actually are kids, which makes it a lot more appropriate. Here, many of the jokes are simply not very funny (The actor's union is called ""F.A.G"". Now, that's comic genius) or repeated way too often (just about every landmark in the world is destroyed by the team's reckless actions).All in all, ""Team America"" is still a mildly amusing movie. The novelty of the whole puppet angle and some brilliant action movie spoofing just make up for a lot of corny jokes and surprisingly inept attempts at satire.*** out of *****",Team America - World Police

120,FairlyAnonymous,"Hilarious most of the time, but annoying at others",7,23 December 2014,"Team America: World Police is a hilarious movie in both premise and in action. The fact that the entire movie is made with marionette dolls is not only funny but clever. The other great thing about this movie is that it is a good satire of America and just about everyone. That is the nice thing about this movie: It should offend everyone equally.The movie follows the premise of Team America having to stop Kim Jong-il before he destroys most of world with weapons of mass destruction. The movie is careful enough to make this premise work by adding many hilarious and weird moments so that the movie never becomes truly offensive (particularly when is shows Islamic stereotypes). One of the greatest things about this movie is that it takes advantage of the marionette dolls and essentially ""breaks the fourth-wall"" without the characters ever being aware. This is done by a lot of gags that involve how stupid the dolls move and just how absurd everything is. Sometimes the dolls don't walk properly, sometimes props seem to mess up, heck; a giant statue of Kim Jong-Il is literally a guy wearing bronze makeup and standing still. This is where a lot of the movie's best jokes come from: The design jokes and the satire jokes.But then, there is the weaker side to this movie: The crude jokes. While some of them work, a lot of them don't. Now I know people will say ""You either like South Park humour or you don't"" (This is made by Trey and Matt, after all) but that isn't it. The problem is that the crude jokes don't add anything to the movie... and they aren't even funny. For one scene, the main character has give oral-sex to another man to be accepted as a member of Team America. This scene is referenced multiple times in the movie, but it was never funny to begin with. Just because something is crude, doesn't mean it is funny. It is only funny if it is executed properly. Just saying crude dialogue isn't funny in itself.Unfortunately, the last third of the movie focuses mostly on crude humour for most of its jokes which makes the movie feel like a real drag. Instead of having witty satire and funny parodies in the first half, it tries to outdo itself in the final act. For some reason the movie thinks that the only way to outdo clever humour is with non- clever humour. Fortunately, the first two thirds of the movie are pretty funny and unique. I wouldn't say the third act of the movie didn't have funny jokes--because it was still funny--but it seemed to get caught up at times and is essentially the weakest point of the film. The intro to this film is also probably one of the funniest moments.The main reason why I like this film is for its originality and how many weird and obscure hidden ""marionette"" jokes are in it.",Team America - World Police
121,roland-104,Team America takes no prisoners (and shoots itself in the foot),6,19 November 2005,"This satirical puppet show - made by the creators of the animated ""South Park"" series on Comedy Central - takes no prisoners in ridiculing almost everyone and everything in the worlds of geopolitics and entertainment.""Team America"" is a small, elite U.S. paramilitary airborne strike force that goes after rogues and terrorists world wide. Their headquarters are hidden within the presidential heads at Mount Rushmore, and they are led by a square jawed older guy who is supposed to be played by Charlton Heston. Their methods can be heavy handed, resulting in such minor nuisances as the destruction of the Eiffel Tower and the Sphinx, but, hey, what matters is making the world a safer place, right? Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz Neocon world imperialism is the major target here, but their opponents, especially among liberal entertainers - folks like George Clooney and Alec Baldwin - also come in for some pretty stiff lampooning. (Baldwin, by the way, was one of those people who promised to leave the U.S. if Bush was reelected but he hasn't followed as of this writing no, that's not in the movie, it's real.) But the featured antihero here is Kim Jong-il, the North Korean dictator and fanatic movie buff, who flatters Baldwin into headlining a show for an international conference at which he plans to demonstrate his destruction of the world. Kim is made out to be a simple, lonely soul at heart, somebody who just needs somebody.Team America itself is full of internal dysfunction: bereavement, jealousies, resentments and infatuations dominate the preoccupations of this little coed killer squad, perhaps one reason why they screw up their missions with some regularity. There is one imaginative lovemaking sequence between two team members that should inspire kids everywhere to reach for their video cameras and their Barbie and Ken dolls.The problem here is one of excess. This film is chock full of good ideas but has spun out of control trying to squeeze in too many of them. Jonathan Swift said, ""Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own."" Filmmakers Trey Parker and Matt Stone even ridicule their own artistic process here. They rejected software that would have made the lip movements of the puppets perfectly synchronized with the dubbed voices, because it would have made the puppet talk too perfect. Likewise, they go out of their way to have the puppets move clumsily: their walking and dancing is especially and purposely sloppy.In violating Swift's definition, Parker and Stone go too far, and end with a work of across-the-board nihilistic negation that leaves the viewer with only little boy silliness  a giggle toward everything and everyone - for sustenance. Besides, who gives a hang about Alec Baldwin? My rating: 6/10 (B-). (Seen on 11/12/05).

122,ScottDMenzel,"A funny, original comedy by none other than the creators of South Park but does Team America go to far?",7,14 October 2004,"I read about 'Team America' a long time ago and I always wanted to see it. I have been a big fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone ever since 'South Park' was first aired. I have continued to show my support to Matt and Trey over the years by watching almost everything they have done from their own movies 'Cannibal: The Musical', 'Orgazmo', and 'BASEketball' to their TV shows 'South Park' and 'That's My Bush.' I have watched almost everything they have done including their shorts that barely anyone has seen 'Your Studio & You' for example, but I must say their live action projects starring humans are always better than the animated projects. But do I still say the same for 'Team America'? Well keep on reading to find out.'Team America' is a very interesting film that features 'Thunder-Birds' like puppets from America fighting Puppet terrorists all over the world. That is what 'Team America' is all about American puppets fighting Terrorist puppets. Is it Funny? Extremely but then what happens in the second act is something that kind of starts to pose questions is this movie going to far?Well the first half of 'Team America' is a classic and if it actually stayed on that track it might have been one of the best comedies ever made. Matt and Trey grab us right from the moment the movie starts because the whole idea of the movie is so ridiculous and funny that we want to watch it but like I said earlier half way though this all changes. Half way through the film, Matt and Trey start to push the buttons to see how much they can get away with in 'Team America.' Which is where the Puppet sex scene comes in. Now is that funny? Yes, very but it stays on screen to long and you get to the point where you say I get the joke. I read several places online that Matt and Trey had to edit the scene to where it just seemed like 'a cheap one night stand' as Trey stated in an interview. In that case, Trey stated that the original scene was longer and was more sweet and romantic and would have lasted what I believe was 5 minutes. The sex scene in the movie now was probably 2 minutes and I felt it went on to long, I could have only imaged it going on longer and how drawn out that would be. But I liked the scene, it was uncalled for and long but it was funny and twisted just like Matt and Trey.Then the movie starts attacking the celebrities and boy do they ever? They take the Screen Actors Guild and change the name to Film Actors Guild, which stands for F.A.G. Well they rip on a ton of A-list celebrities including Sean Penn, Helen Hunt, Danny Glover, Michael Moore, Samuel L. Jackson, Alec Baldwin, Liv Tyler, George Clooney, Janeane Garofalo, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Matt Damon, and several others and this is where I think the film starts to go to far. There is one scene where they briefly show the celebrities as F.A.G.s which is fine and semi-humorous but then in the second half of Team America its does nothing more than make fun of these celebrities and make them seem so idiotic. Plus you add in all the curse words which Matt and Trey love to use plus the 'gay jokes' and it seems all over the top filled with SQ, a term which is used in the mass media world that refers to sex, violence, crude humor, bad language and pushing the limits to see how far they can go. What I don't understand is why Matt and Trey in their non-live action films have to push the limits. The movie was hilarious in its first half; its concept was fresh and original. I loved the idea. Why couldn't they just stay on the topic of Team America fighting Terrorists and not Team America fighting celebrities? I thought the first part worked and the second part just felt dumb and acting to see how far they could go. I just feel it got old after a while with Matt and Trey trying to attack and offend almost everyone. I am a big fan of Michael Moore and I know Michael Moore won't care that he is being made fun of in the film because one, he's a friend of Matt and Trey's and two, he has a sense of humor ditto on George Clooney but Sean Penn is already steaming and I think in a way he has a reason to even though this is a fictional movie but it is calling him a idiot and I doubt him and several others will appreciate it. Sure making fun of celebrities is fun at times and it was at some point but it just went overboard just like the 'South Park Movie' did. The 'South Park Movie' must have been a landmark for the most curse words used in a motion picture because wow every other word was a curse. It just seemed as the movie went on that it was trying to push the limits of the MPAA and curse as many times as possible and get away with it. It got old and wasn't funny after a while and that's what kind of happened with 'Team America'. 'Team America' is funnier that the 'South Park Movie' and is more creative but the problems I had with the 'South Park Movie' are still there although didn't bother me as much.My favorite thing about 'Team America' was the soundtrack which most of the songs are sung by Trey Parker. Trey Parker knows how to write funny songs from the entire soundtrack of Cannibal: The Musical featuring 'Hang The Bastard' and 'When I was on top of you' to Orgazmo's 'Now you're a man' song, to BASEketball's 'Warts on your dick' song to the entire South Park movie soundtrack everything musical wise is brilliant. The America F*ck yeah! Song was hilarious and I'm so Ronely was hysterical on the 'Team America' soundtrack and so was the rest of it. To me it was the best part of the movie that and Kim Jong II who was nothing more than Cartman from South Park. So in the end 'Team America' is worth a watch. It is very humorous but gets kind of tired some in the second half. The soundtrack is the best and the idea is original and fresh. The movie's ending was kind of lame to me because I feel since Matt and Trey are so twisted then they should have ended the film on a more non-Hollywood note. In the end, however the movie does make you feel guilty for laughing at some of it, since it does tie in with things happening in real life. So, If you easily offended I would definitely stay away from this one but if you can handle crude humor, gay jokes, puppet sex, and anything else the south park creators can throw at you then give it chance. It's not as great as it could have been but its still pretty darn good. My Rating for 'Team America' is a 7/10. Oh and one more thing the MPAA made Trey and Matt edit out the John Kerry and George Bush part of the film, I was actually amazed that they took it out completely. I wonder if Matt and Trey are getting soft? Well I hope that scene is included on the DVD.",Team America - World Police
123,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Team America: World Police (2004),8,4 April 2008,"A great piece of comedy from Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Classic Matt and Trey humor with puppets blowing peoples heads off. What more could you want? On top of the already great stuff we get great songs. Of course they are rude and sexual but who cares when they being played at the right times.The puppets looked fantastic. The celebrities actually looked like the puppets. Except for Matt Damon(MATT DAMON!!. It has great voice acting. Voices were supplied by Trey Parker and Matt Stone like they always are with a few others actors doing voices thrown in.Possibly everyone knows about the puppet sex scene and almost everyone has picked up two dolls and put them into sexual positions. We get to see that happen in this.Very nice work on the locations in this movie. Not many movies have entire locations made out of beer bottle lids and cardboard. It truly is great.Now to the problems. Trey Parker and Matt Stone always touch upon the political theme. Thats what the whole movie is about. I hate politics. Luckily the comedy over shadows some of the politics. Another thing which is always typical of Trey and Matt is there ""America is the best country ever"" theme. It can get annoying.I recommend this if you like Trey and Matt's humor and if you watch South Park. This was very entertaining.8/10",Team America - World Police
124,arthurclay,"Rated R for violence, language, and Puppet Sex??????",10,30 May 2005,"So damn funny it almost killed us all. When Kim Jong-Il sings about how ronery he is you'll be rolling in the aisles of your living room. The puppets are great but Jong's puppet is by far the most comical and the most entertaining. The scene with Il and ""Hans Brix"" is outstanding and outrageous it's like a cross between James Bond and Bugs Bunny achieving the desired effect on the audience with a little foul language and witty banter to help it along flawlessly. The P.D.A. speech comes straight from the conservative play book and it's amazingly appropriate I don't know where these two guys envisioned it but bravo anyways. The humor is sarcastic to the hilt and Parker and Stone use irony about as delicately as throwing someone into a cement mixer which works like a charm. I think to really understand what they are trying to say you have to be an American and an educated one at that (and I am not referring to liberals in case anyone's wondering). You might be asking yourself ""What is their point?"" Are all Americans blithering idiots? Does the whole world hate America? Does America want to destroy everyone who is different from them? Is Alec Baldwin really a pussy? I know what the answer to that first question is. However, I think it's best for people to make up their own minds as it will be more reasonable to them or at least taste better. And a final note regarding Roger Ebert's review on Team America: Roge, nobody is a puppet unless they choose to be one but all of us are fools, and yes while all of this does matter now it will not matter in the end. You're one for three so I'm glad your not in charge of ""Team America"".",Team America - World Police

Everyone in this film is ridiculed on all sides(SNL in 2017 should take notes), and I mean EVERYONE.It was very timely for the post 9/11 era, and it does a great job of showcasing the absurdities of everything from country singers cashing in with sappy songs on tragedies, really uninformed patriotism or apathy for what is going on in the world, idiotic self-righteous leftists and Hollywood clowns like Alec Baldwin/Tim Robbins/Matt Damon, etc. with some sex and vomiting and puppet fight scenes that you can't help but crack a smile at.The Film Actors Guild idea was truly brilliant.

126,The_Orenda,A real let down,2,26 May 2005,"I love South Park. My favorite episodes were the ones with NAMBLA and Wal-Mart, among others. But I feel like all the revenue generated from that hit show was pumped into making this piece of unfunny, boring garbage. If you're a fan of parody and reference spotting, Team America is up your alley, with Kill Bill, Matrix, the original Star Wars, among many of the movies cut and pasted into marionette form. Unfortunately, if you couldn't care less about exploiting pop culture, and actually just wanted to enjoy a movie, please kindly pass on this one.Team America tears a warpath through terrorists' hearts, as the Film Actors' Guild and North Korea aim to shut them down.Someone should have told these dudes that Thunderbirds is over forty years old. They should have stuck to a sequel to South Park. I couldn't laugh at any of the scenes, even when I wanted to. The infamous sex scene? It would have been funny enough seeing it in human form. I don't know. I think it was the puppets that were the overall turn-off. I remember being an 80s kid and being bored stupid waiting for Thunderbirds to end before Thundercats came on. Twenty years later, and I would have picked any Family Guy or Simpsons episode over this boring parody. You know what? Use your own judgment, but I bet your eyes will glaze over as many times as mine did.",Team America - World Police
127,OneAnjel,I'm torn on how to review this film,5,3 January 2021,"I watched Team America when it came out and remember thinking that it was well-done and sarcastic with tongue in cheek humor that was edgy, to put it mildly. In addition to creating a satirical take on big-budget action flicks, it was, I think, Parker's response to Bush Jr. wagging the dog and turning his entire tenure into a hunt for Osama Bin Laden and the war on terrorists. In that sense, it revealed how the world then viewed America more than how it viewed itself. Fast forward to 2020, watching it makes me realize this film now demonstrates how one U.S. political party views the other -- one party wanting to offer our hard earned freedoms to other countries while viewing the other party as tyrants for merely trying to retain the rights and freedoms that offering to the world has proven to be untenable. While we can say it's just entertainment, novel, and yes, funny, we might also say that the many changes over the last 15 years have changed the meaning of this film. We are a long way now from those wasted wars and world domination. America now wants to save America from remaining in the downward spiral the trampling of the Constitution has afforded it.",Team America - World Police

129,joestank15,Hit or miss.,6,25 June 2005,"A puppet action movie spoof brought to us from the creators of South Park. They pretty much cover all of the tired old action movie clichés. Unfortunately, spewing out every lame-ass catch-phrase from every single action movie of the last say 20 years does not equal comedy. Neither does having a Kim Jong Il have one joke (that he pronounces ""l's"" as ""r's"" and ""v's"" as ""w's"") for the entire movie make for good comedy. I thought it was strange that they wasted that character out of all of them. There are a quite a few funny moments though, and some very funny (and strangely catchy) songs. I like South Park, but I just felt that Trey Parker and Matt Stone weren't trying very hard sometimes. Many of the jokes are hit or miss. Overall though, I give it a B-",Team America - World Police
130,Barky44,More purile than humorous; Stone & Parker have lost it.,5,23 October 2004,"I have to give Matt Stone & Trey Parker cudos for their film Team America: World Police. Using marionettes instead of actors is a pretty gutsy maneuver, a novel approach to top all other novel approaches (definitely more interesting than the celluloid puffery known as ""Sky Captain"", but I digress).It was a gutsy maneuver, but sadly this film just doesn't have it. ""It"" meaning the patented Stone & Parker humor, irreverence, satire, and silliness made famous in the South Park series and, most especially, the excellent ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" extravaganza several years back.""Team America"" is more purile than humorous. Sure, South Park is pretty vulgar, and having a speaking role in the name of a part of the female anatomy isn't exactly kid stuff. But their former work had something special, it was truly funny in an intelligent, yet unpretentious, sort of way.""Team America"", on the other hand, is simply vulgar. Plain and simple. Not really humorous, at least not consistently, but is funny in the way children looking up dirty words is funny for them. If they think spewing out dirty words in and of itself is funny, then they have gone over the deep end.I have a hard time giving this film better than 5 out of 10. What it has in genuinely funny moments is more than lost by being simply ... well, I'll say it again, vulgar.",Team America - World Police

132,extravaluejotter,"Loud, Tasteless, Vulgar - More Please!",7,10 September 2006,"During the 1950s and 1960s, A man called Gerry Anderson produced a string (no pun intended) of TV shows and a couple of films shot in ""Supermarionation"". This so-called technique involved the use of puppets and small sets, a lot of model effects and a minimal resident cast who would take on as many different voice roles as they could. Anderson's reasons for developing ""Supermarionation"" were simply down to cost. The fantastic stories that he wanted to tell would have bankrupted him if he'd had to pay human actors and build full-sized sets. Eventually he moved on to conventional TV with proper actors but he is probably best remembered for his wobbly puppet sci-fi adventures. The basic plots and ""Wooden"" acting were augmented with an array of high-tech gadgets and vehicles and you were guaranteed at least one major explosion per episode, if not more.Legend has it that Trey Parker and Matt Stone saw an episode of the original ""Thunderbirds"" TV series and that was how they got the idea for ""TAWP"". Parker and Stone must have seen the parallel between Gerry Anderson's cheap TV thrill rides and Jerry Bruckheimer's expensive all-action summer blockbusters like ""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock"".Well, that's enough background. In terms of bang-for-buck and body count, ""TAWP"" ticks all the Bruckheimer and Anderson boxes. Many major global landmarks are destroyed in the course of the film, along with a fair few ""Stunt Puppets"". The fact that all the effects are obviously done on a shoestring adds considerable charm to proceedings. It's also pretty funny, too. Not just in terms of ""how many swear words can you drop into a conversation?"" but also sight gags, one-liners and some jaw-dropping bad taste jokes.So it's a good movie then? Er, unless you're a flag-saluting unquestioning US patriot, that is. The movie relentlessly lampoons US foreign policy and the blinkered world view of Americans in general. A number of high-profile liberal American actors (and a certain overweight liberal documentary maker) are also side-swiped but this could be seen to balance out the attack on the American Establishment's post-9/11 right-wing militaristic approach to world affairs.Personally, I view the digs at Alec Baldwin, George Clooney, Sean Penn et al as in keeping with the style of the film. Bruckheimer movies have no room in them for people who use diplomacy, influence and gentle persuasion, and neither does ""TAWP"". ""Team America - World Police"" satirises US domestic policy as much as it does US foreign policy.It's also possible to tune out the film's political agenda and laugh at puppets doing ""Bullet Time"", getting naked and throwing up.

I'm glad that Parker and Stone pulled off a few jokes striking at all fronts of the subject (that is America acting out as world police) and not only does Hollywood get the parody boot from these guys, but also Michael Moore as well as many others.

136,guyfromjerzee,"A sick, vile and undoubtedly funny comedy",7,20 September 2005,"If there's one thing I have to say about Trey Parker and Matt Stone, they do know how to push the envelope. Granted, their absurd sometimes just comes off as...well...absurd. But usually it's funny. ""Team America"" gets off to a moderately slow start, but gets funnier and funnier as it goes along. The gags are hit-or-miss, but in this case there were more hits than misses, and enough for me to give this movie a positive review. Let's start off with what didn't work. I didn't find Kim Jong Il's character very funny. Basically, the whole joke is that he pronounces every ""L"" as an ""R."" The joke isn't offensive, but most jokes have to arise from sort of truth and having Trey Parker not even attempting to do a Korean accent and simply pronouncing the ""L's"" as ""R's"" is simply a lazy attempt at comedy. The most hilarious scene of the movie (and I think many agree with me here) is the puppet sex scene. Now, just the idea of puppets having sex is pretty damn funny, but as I said before, these guys know how to push the envelope. So we don't just see puppets having sex, but also doing other kinky and fetishistic things in bed. It gets to the point where you have to think to yourself, ""I can't believe these guys went there."" And as ridiculous as the jokes is, I loved the one involving Matt Damon only being able to say his own name. Parker and Stone, of course, have an intense hatred for the majority of actors, which is why they chose to make a movie with puppets instead of actors. I also liked their slam on ""Pearl Harbor"" and movie montages. Another talent of Parker and Stone is their use of profanity. We see and hear profane things in movies all the time, but they use it in a particularly funny and extremely offensive way. You watch a film like this, and you can just picture your parents and grandparents gasping in horror. Which is part of all the fun.",Team America - World Police
137,au_law2001,Sure puts the 'F' in funny!,8,11 August 2005,"F---yeah! Trey Parker and Matt Stone sure did a good a job in bringing this spoof of all the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay films in this puppet movie that's also a spoof of the cult classic marionette action TV series Thunderbirds, and at the same time, it pokes fun at all political sides, though George Bush and John Kerry were missing, crap! But still, it is funny to see them make fun of all the clichés in action films and war on terrorism. In some ways, it does poke fun at America itself especially poking fun at how other countries see America, and make liberals look the way conservatives see them(I liked Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins and Michael Moore puppets),and make other nations look the way some people see them. And not to mention Kim Jong Il! He was very funny with the 'Ls' and 'Rs' and his song about him being lonely. Overall this has to be the funniest Trey and Matt made next to South Park, recommended to the fans of South Park, and to those who like adult humor, the spoofs here are hilarious!

THe puppet work is excellent, but I wonder what Gerry Anderson would think if he saw this picture.There is one rather gross bit at one point which I thought was totally gratuitous but the movie overall is very funny as it gets at the Gung Ho jingoism of some action films. Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Maurice La Marche and the rest of the voice cast are very good in their performances and nobody it seems is safe from the parody as people like MIchael Moore, Matt Damon, Sean Penn etc. are given a thorough roasting.

139,Zombified_660,Pretty much a love/hate thing going on here...,5,30 May 2005,"Firstly, I admire Trey Parker and Matt Stone for having the cahoneys to put this out at a time when so much of the media is under heavy scrutiny. To put something out that's so blatantly un-PC is a brave move and I wish them lots of luck with the movie.However, for me, the political counterpunch it gives to the US authorities was one of the only things I enjoyed about it. Team America is a movie you'll either love or hate. It basically has one joke, maybe two, that are repeated over and over and over, and if you found those jokes funny then you'll laugh your behind off all the way through, but if you didn't you may be left sadly cold.Halfway through the movie, Team America's base has been destroyed and an errant Team America member comes back to try and help. The leader details that if he wants to work for Team America again he has to be willing to do anything, then drops his pants. This joke perfectly illustrates what's wrong with the movie. If you find that funny okay, but that's what EVERY joke in the movie is like. It's simultaneously the movie's main selling point and everything that sucks about it.The movie relies completely on puppets doing crude/wrong things, but never really goes past fart/wang jokes or un-PC jibes at other countries. Other similarly themed movies like Meet The Feebles or Wizards have animated characters dealing with actual real politics, real sex, drug addiction whatever...point is, they are actually mature movies, and for not assuming that everyone watching is going to laugh when the puppets/cartoons have sex, they come off looking very clever. Team America is crashingly immature, and you'll either dig that or not. I didn't. I know Parker and Stone are clever, and capable of much more, so I left with the same feeling I had with Kill Bill, that I'd just watched a couple of little boys playing with their video cameras.What's even more frustrating is that when wit is injected into proceedings (NB: This is damned RARE) the movie is pure genius. For instance, real animals are involved in some proceedings (obviously dwarfing the puppets) resulting in some of the best, funniest sequences in the film, and simultaneously paying homage to things like Land of the Giants and the 50s/60s heritage the movie pulls on. In a more consistent movie, these would have been the icing on the cake, as it is it feels more like being slapped in the face with what could have been.Don't get me wrong, if you don't expect anything more than a lot of cussing and puppets, this movie will provide it, and you'll probably enjoy it. However, those who got me to watch the film had made out it was big, funny and clever. It isn't, and if I hear them singing the America, **** Yeah song one more time I will kick them hard in the face. It seems once again, this is a movie with not much going on that's been blown out of all proportion by a small hardcore of fanboys. Watch it and make your own mind up, but you could be sorely disappointed. I'd err on the side of caution and just rent Meet the Feebles. Jackson didn't care if people liked him or not after the movie, and the film is therefore far less dull.",Team America - World Police
140,liberalgems,"Hateful, NAZI - Like, Propaganda Film",1,25 March 2007,"All the mean-spirited creators of this film did was substitute liberal, anti-war movie stars & filmmakers as America's most deadly enemies. Didn't the Germans do something similar to a different group of people during World War 2? This is truly the most disgusting, violent, liberal-hating, (way beyond bashing), stupid movies I hope to ever see in my lifetime! It's certainly beyond satire or cathartic violence! What's so amusing about a bunch of American fools blowing up some of the world's most important cultural landmarks, or showing scenes of torture in prison? The gruesome violence at the end of this movie, where every liberal actor and actress in Hollywood is brutally killed, with guts flying every which way, makes it extremely inappropriate for children, or anyone who is not sadistic! I'm a middle-aged adult, and I had to look away from the screen! Forget about the sex scene, it's less than 30-seconds, and certainly not worth the price of admission. Nor has it anything to do with the story line! It's just a ploy for the curious to shell out their hard earned money to purchase a movie ticket.I felt like walking out towards the end to make a political statement to the audience, but instead I resisted in order to write a thorough review.

The commercials did this movie no justice, just made it look really crappy. I went to see this on the last night it was playing at my local theater, and I was so surprised at how funny everything in it really was. Some scenes had me laughing for a whole ten minutes like the now famous puppet-sex scene, the vomiting scene, and the theme song.One can't complain about the puppetry. The film makers did a great job at making the facial expressions, and body movements of the puppets.It was hilarious theway they made the Hollywood liberals look bad. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have a way of insulting everyone possible and not sparing anyone. The same can be said for South Park.This movie isn't for anyone who is offended easily. There is plenty of strong sexual content, and graphic, often merciless violence.

142,colonel_green,"Pearl Harbor sucked, and I miss you.",9,14 October 2004,"""Team America"" is an awesome experience, one the most distinct films you're ever likely to see. It may be the funniest movie of the year, and certainly one of the most satirical. Parker and Stone don't stray that far from their usual motifs (thankfully); this would probably work as an episode of South Park, puppets notwithstanding. I could even see it as a live action movie, although the entertainment factor wouldn't be as great. The puppets, which could have been (and to an extent, are) a gimmick, don't get old, and add to the movie greatly. The plot is basic: Team America, the world's police, are trying to stop terrorists (all of whom fall under into one generic group, with mutual aims) from using WMDS to destroy the world. Kim Jong-Il is the one supplying the WMDS. They recruit Gary Johnston, a Broadway actor (currently starring in the musical ""Lease"" (parodying both ""Grease"" and ""Rent"") with the catchy title song of ""Everyone has AIDS""). Gary has to act like a terrorist, to lead them to the source. Trouble is, Gary is haunted by the memories of the death of his brother (at the hands of gorillas) as a result of his acting. The rest of the team are all also hilarious stereotypes: - Lisa, the blonde psychiatrist, who is attracted to Gary, but burdened by the loss of fellow TA member Carson, who proposed to her moments before he was gunned down. - Sarah, an ""empath"" who says things like ""I sense you are confused""; as a Star Trek: TNG fan, I recognized the inspiration for the character easily. - Joe, the All American, Scott Summers-type from Nebraska, who is in love with Sarah (who is in love with Gary, like Lisa). - Chris, who provides the single-largest amount of the film's profanity, is a martial arts expert, and loathes actors because of an incident in his past. - Spotswood, the old, cigarette-smoking boss, who would probably be played by Brian Dennehy or Brian Cox in a live action film. TA:WP is chock full of references to other films. There are the usual suspects, like Star Wars and The Matrix, but also Kill Bill: Vol. 1, the ""Conspiracy"" episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and several references to South Park. Two of the most notable South Park references relate to Kim Jong-Il; first off, as you can tell from the trailers, he speaks exactly like the City Wok guy. He also uses Cartman's ""you're breakin' my balls"" line from the episode where Kenny died for real (temporarily). Also like in South Park, there are ""real"" scenes hilariously interspersed with the scenes with the puppets; not to mention several awesome musical numbers. The ""theme"" of the film is ""America! F**k Yeah!"", which is played several times, in different tones; at one point, it's sung mournfully, after the archtypical scene where the Team falls out with each other. Politically, the film savages both the Right and the Left (politically-active actors are hit especially hard). Whenever Team America goes on a mission to stop the bad guys, the demolish whole cities and blow up major landmarks, while cheerily and obliviously telling the locals that freedom has triumphed and they are safe (the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triumphe, the Pyramids, and the Sphinx are all blow up by Team America, provoking no reaction beyond ""We missed""). On the other hand, people like Alec Baldwin and Michael Moore play right into Kim Jong-Il's hands, nearly allowing him to destroy the world. This whole philosophy is summed up by Gary in a speech that divides the world in Dicks, Pussies, and Assholes. Ratings-wise, the MPAA was being its usual self with regard to the NC-17 rating. The amount of swearing in this movie obviously warrants an R, but the whole hubbub regarding the puppet sex scene is ludicrous (as the MPAA is wont to be); first off, the puppets have no genitilia, and second, they're PUPPETS. There are many small details that amuse, such as during the scene where all world leaders assemble, and the Ugandan leader looks exactly like Idi Amin. And whenever a caption appears to identify what part of the world we're in (Cairo, North Korea, Panama) it comes complete with a readout showing exactly how far it is to America (my favourite was the Panama one, which said that Panama Canal, Central America, was X miles from Real America). All in all, a great film, and one that should be seen by every person who can get into an R-rated movie, through legal or extralegal means. 10/10.",Team America - World Police

No one is safe, they literally blast Michael Moore, imply Republicans of being gay way ahead of Rep. Foley, then they destroy cherished American icons via models and slap Hollywood with the very vehicle they're using to put their message across! Yet despite its total cheesiness, there is dark humour throughout, like making fun of Orientals with saying ""L's"" and ""R's"" in Kim Jong-Il's plea for clemency in the musical ditty ""I'm So Rone-ry"" and then there is Alec Baldwin with a new acting association called the Federation of Actors' Guild or FAG! This picture looks at the neo-Roman Imperialism of Bush II's near decade of power and the wishy-washy collapse of being a Democrat post-Clinton...However, even I myself who enjoys ribald humour, nevertheless thought that literally raping what was previously a child's domain of puppets with the concept of sex - albeit two consenting marionettes allegedly in love - then pushing way past the envelope and bursting the parcel by simulating fellatio between two males was a bit much and destroyed much of the regard I had held for the picture!It is interesting that the makers of the picture chose Jong-Il as the main villain, not Saddam Hussein as in most ""South Park"" vehicles, because now North Korea is out testing nukes reviving fears the world thought it put behind with Reagan, Nixon, Chernenko and Brezhnev!If there is a new Cold War, you can bet Team America will be there again with hot commentary on the issue and possibly tracking other trends along the way!

145,frankwhat,Crazy,7,17 October 2004,"At first I didn't really know what to make of this movie. The previews made it look dumb as the idea of puppets really doesn't appeal to me but after hearing how funny it was I had to suck it up and wait in line. After completed viewing, I surprisingly give this movie a good review. That isn't to say that it didn't have it's stupid parts such as the North Korean general doing a little song number that no one laughed at. Also be forewarned when I state that this is an extremely graphic movie and not to be fooled by the cartoon-ish appearance as it deals with a lot of sexual subjects in fine detail. The only other pitfall that I found was that some instances tried a little bit too hard to get a rise out of the audience and instead fell flat since it was just plain gross, but there were only a few instances of this. I have to add that some of the songs on the soundtrack were equally as funny as the movie if you listen to the lyrics. Among the funniest parts that I can think of offhand are the Matt Damon character, the speech on the three kinds of people, and how the actor responds to the 'you can leave if you want to, the door's right over there' ultimatum. Man those ""South Park"" fellas really have dirty minds!Final Motif:Movies: Not a must unless you're still in school and all your little buddies are going to be saying how cool they were because you haven't seen it yet and we all remember how important it was too prove them wrong.DVD Purchase: Probably not unless it eventually found its way into the bargain bin.

146,Derek237,"Those puppets creep me out, man...",7,30 October 2005,"Hopefully I'm not the only person to see this movie and feel a little uneasy at first. It took me a while to decompress to the puppet environment. But after I could emerge myself in the movie I felt better though in the back of my mind I was always just a bit freaked out by those puppets. But, this is irrelevant.Matt Stone and Trey Parker usually have some interesting, skewed comment to make on our society with their hit show South Park, and with Team America, I was expecting a huge satire on America's war-crazy antics. While it does have some of that, I think it really ends up more of a satire of Jerry Bruckhiemer-type films and the blatant American jingoism underlying in them. There's nothing really wrong with that except it ends up being more just a bunch of crazy stuff happening instead of having that kind of comment that the South Park episodes may have.I really laughed my ass off during this movie. The songs like, ""America: F**k yeah,"" the puppet sex scene, the big speech at the end, and the hilarious ""MATT DAMOOONNN"" line are just some things that make this a hilarious, wacky...puppet movie. As far as raunchy comedies go, I don't think you can get much raunchier than this. Team America: World Police wasn't as clever as I hoped it would be, but it was funnier than I could ever expect.Last but certainly not least, I would also like to comment on the performance by one of my heroes, Maurice LeMarche, who played the voice of Alec Baldwin. LeMarche is probably best known for his voice work as ""The Brain"" from ""Pinky and the Brain,"" and it was great to see his incredible talent added to this movie. It was the highlight of the entire thing for me.My rating: 7/10",Team America - World Police
147,CurtMan@LVCM.com,Droll and Offensive Enough,8,17 October 2004,"Paper marionettes, subliminal musical numbers, raunchy, obscene dialogue and interaction... ""Team America: World Police"", while it could have provided significantly more of these characteristics to its already-converted perverse audience, is crude, intelligent, and hilarious enough to warrant a decent recommendation as an (original) concept of comedy. The movie basically consists of a pack of ""heroes"" who identify themselves as ""Team America"" endeavoring around the globe to abolish terrorism (while simultaneously wreaking havoc to major landmarks and citizens, but it's the American way!). There are scenes that tend to stretch out perhaps a little too long in their intentions: in particular, when introducing ""Gary"", I found it completely redundant and rather tedious to delve into his entire personal background, and detailing his contributions to ""Team America"": he is definitely the most unwelcome character, and many times, Parker and Stone deviate from the hilarious action and dialogue to focus on his ""emotional turmoil"", which is particularly lame in a film such as this. Yet, there are many good, hilarious intentions here. The deriding pokes at nuclear madman Kim Jong Il were very befitting and comfortingly funny: here we have a deranged lunatic striving to unleash incivility and chaos around the world, and in physical nature, he's nothing short of a bickering pee-wee! I most especially enjoyed the marks against the ""Hollywood Elite"", who are portrayed as ignorant, shallow, and dastardly, in their constant cause to confront ""evil corporations and deride America's ""overbearing nature""; I suppose it is appropriate to say that ""Team America"" gets the best of their stupidity in the end! The sexual innuendos contrasting the ideologies of conservatives, liberals, and terrorists such as Kim Jong Il is beyond hilarious: it is universally and perversely true! ""Team America"" is full of delightful, hilarious elements that many fans of Parker and Stone can appreciate from the ""South Park"" mind-set, yet it also traffics in sentimentality (the stories behind ""Gary"")and artificiality (the puppets ""dancing around"" was hardly impressive); yet for the most part, it warrants a solid recommendation in the field of comedy for providing some genuine, intelligent, and memorable humor that more than compensates for its numerous lackings.

They only dare the easy things, things they know there are enough people out there whom it will appeal to, at least in one generation in one country. Or a broader audience, like using North Korea's leader as the bad guy, how daring, how original, how iconoclastic indeed !.This is a purely commercial product, targeted at teenagers, preferably young ones, hence all the millenia-old jokes based on sex, poop, puke, and the like.

Moreover, the writer bashes everyone, which is fine, but seems to say ""I live in a shitty world but I don't care""; he is not a citizen, just a consumer.

151,Boggman,The funniest film I have EVER seen!!!!,10,10 June 2005,"Once in a very great while, a movie comes along that is SO innovative, so original, so funny, and so creatively memorable that it stays with you long after the credits have rolled. I saw that movie last night, and it's called ""Team America: World Police""!! Comedy hasn't seen much of these movies lately, but ""Team America"" certainly makes up for the gap in what I would say was definitely the most gut-busting, hilarious film spoof ever made for adults. This film is so priceless that I wouldn't dare include any spoilers, but here is a quick summary of events. Team America is a group of international crime fighters who always manage to get their man, and in the process; leave a path of total carnage and destruction in their path. When their next assignment calls for a little ""espionage"", they recruit ""Gary"", (a Broadway actor with demons of his own) to go undercover for them to fight the terrorists holding the weapons of mass destruction!!! Along the way, we learn all about loyalty, love, teamwork & betrayal: PUPPET STYLE!! This film was definitely made for adults, with plenty of action, profanity, gore, and hard core sex throughout the film. All done tastefully (yeah right!) of course. ;-) It also boasts one of the most fantastic and satirical scripts I have ever seen on film. Matt Stone and Trey Parker take absolutely no prisoners as they tear into everything from the action, musical, horror, comedy, & adult film genres. There is also plenty of political humor in the film. Now for the puppets! These marionettes are so life-like it is stunning! The facial expressions are so detailed, yet in many scenes, the puppeteers actually spoof themselves by staying true to original puppeteer style. The walk and move like old fashioned puppets on a string, but the technology of them as a whole (especially there faces and costumes) is top of the line. This is a full blown action film. It is filmed just the way any big budget Hollywood epic is filmed (think Day After Tomorrow, or Independence day ), with the real difference being that this movie is actually GOOD! All the sets in ""Team America"" are meticulously crafted, and are splendid eye candy for the audience. The explosions and pyrotechnics are top-notch, and much better to watch in this movie than in the crappy action films that Hollywood regularly churns out by the dozen each year. I can't say enough good things about ""Team America: World Police"" ! This is a 10 star film if there ever was one. I had to pause the movie 3 times while I was watching it because I was literally crying with tears of laughter. I will say that this film is completely adult oriented, and parents will need to choose carefully if allowing their children to watch. If you collect DVD's, this is a movie that MUST go into your collection. I never saw the R rated theater version, but the unrated and uncensored version is the way to go if renting or purchasing, because many, many scenes had to be thrown out for the MPAA to give ""Team America"" its R rating. On the uncut version, we get to see this film in all its glory. I will watch this movie repeatedly, and can not wait to see it again. As the theme song so eloquently states: ""America... F**K YEAH""!!! HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! GOD BLESS YOU TREY AND MATT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Team America - World Police

155,Jim-500,Brilliant satire,8,7 June 2005,"I never caught on to the humor of South Park--it is too over the top for me. I did see the movie, which I enjoyed, but not as much as Team America. Team America is a brilliant and multi-layered satire that delivers plenty of belly laughs and amusement. And when it's not doing that, it's skewering well-meaning folks on both sides of the political spectrum.The story is at once topical and hilarious. A special government agency called Team America has taken it upon itself to defend the world against alleged terrorists--whether the world wants to be defended or not, and whether or not the terrorists really exist. In their work, the Team (consisting of a handful of puppets bedecked in red-white-and-blue jumpsuits) end up destroying many of the places they're trying to save, but that's okay--as long as they get the terrorists. Their secret weapon is a Broadway actor named Gary whom they've hired to infiltrate the terrorists' secret hideaways to obtain valuable information. (Why an actor? Because through his acting, he can be a convincing terrorist. You gotta admit, it makes sense.)North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il carries much of the movie as the evil villain bent on taking over the world, though a group of Hollywood actors who want nothing but peace through diplomacy also--somehow--end up as evil. But it's okay, Team America has the guile and wit to battle them all in the name of freedom. Some of the movie is over-the-top (the last scene between Spotswoode and Gary comes to mind), but for my money, any failings are made up for by the brilliance of the rest of the movie. The soundtrack has some hilarious songs on it, including ""Freedom Isn't Free"" (it costs a buck-oh-five). But the highlight of the movie for me was Kim Jong-il singing a truly sweet and touching ballad, ""I'm So Ronery"" (""I'm So Lonely"" minus the stereotyped speech). Seems to me that Parker and Stone are saying that everyone wants to be liked and understood, and that when someone is lonely enough they might turn into a dictator. And even then, dictators still have feelings, contrary to what our own politicians would tell us. I also liked the way the film doesn't just show senseless mayhem and destruction--it also lingers for a few moments afterward to show the stunned civilians looking over the wreckage of their towns. This provides a moment of helpful reflection, because while we're laughing at the satire, in the back of our minds we know this is actually happening to people across the ocean, and it serves to show respect for those people. A nice touch that would definitely be frowned upon by the current real-life administration.The puppets are made in the style of the 1960s British TV show, ""The Thunderbirds."" Roger Ebert, who didn't like the movie, claimed that no one had ever seen that show, but he didn't ask me--I instantly recognized the style (and what a great TV show it was!). The sets, the puppeteering are all wonderful. And the movie even manages to take digs at itself--such as when the puppets are shown trying to walk, and all they really do is bounce up and down. Because everything is played so seriously, it ends up as another level of satire, and another good source of guffaws. This movie is for adults only, in my opinion. But teenagers are so hip these days, they would probably enjoy it too (and they've probably seen and heard it all before anyway). If you want to laugh, have an open mind, and want to see what satire is all about, this is the flick for you.",Team America - World Police

There's enough filler jokes that yuk it up plenty. Crass as any South Park episode you'll ever see and in marionette form to boot. Some of it is over the top...er, well all of it is pretty much over the top, but you'll be a bit ashamed to find yourself chuckling or catch yourself laughing out loud at times. There are moments though that one may feel rundown and tired of the joke. Though, all this applies only if you are a fan of the genre. If not, you'll likely not enjoy much here. Loosely put, this is a commentary of how heavy handed American foreign policy can be and of how obtuse Americans are to the rest of the world. While not entirely accurate, I can't say they're wrong either. One mini-joke I liked was the cut-in to a new location and the audience was told how far (and what direction) it was from America. It is well known that Americans never care to learn about anything that happens beyond their own borders. ;-P The marionette action is pretty good overall. The dialogue is rife with biting humor and was well done. While it can be slow at times, the movie consistently pokes fun at many factions, other films and even at itself.

Team America - a social commentary, biting satire, a dose of gross-out humor and all with puppets. Gotta give them points for originality...if they pulled it off properly, maybe.Honestly I was expecting a lot more laughs out of this film, coming from the makers of South Park. There is plenty of sick humor that is just so, so wrong (I hope that's the first and last time I ever see puppets engaging in all forms of intercourse and fetishes), but after the first joke it gets old real fast. For the rest of the movie we're treated to lame musical numbers and drawn out dialog scenes, far from being totally tongue-in-cheek, it all seems to be taking itself pretty seriously. Which isn't very funny...Perhaps the only redeeming feature of the movie are the puppets themselves and the sets, visually it's pretty impressive seeing what they were able to achieve. In conclusion, stay away unless you're some die-hard South Park fan. Not much here otherwise!",Team America - World Police
158,filmbuff-36,The best satire to come out this year,8,2 December 2004,"""Team America: World Police"" isn't just a fun motion picture, it's the best time I've had at the movies in a long time. Tasteless, offensive and disgusting, it's the perfect antidote for a movie season loaded with too much political seriousness. A send up of the classic 1960s puppet show ""Thuderbirds"" along with empty-headed Jerry Bruckheimer epics, the movie reaches new highs by sinking to new lows.The world is in desperate trouble. Terrorists are planning a worldwide attack, and the only ones who can stop them is Team America, an anti-terrorist squad that polices the world. Led by Spottswoode (voice of Daran Norris), the team recruits Broadway actor Gary Johnston (voice of Trey Parker) to infiltrate an Egyptian terrorist cell and gain information about the next attack.Gary is at first unwilling, but comes around after an inspiring tour of the nation's capital, set to inspiring music, natch. But while they thwart an attack, they discover that there is an even bigger mastermind behind the conspiracy. North Korean President Kim Jong Il plots to destroy the worldwide infrastructure.The team soon succumbs to personal problems, with psychologist Lisa (voice of Kristen Miller) and empathic specialist Sarah (voice of Masasa) vying for Johnston's affection, gung-ho martial artist Chris (voice of Matt Stone) harboring a deep-rooted hated of actors, and Gary harboring his own personal demons with his family. They must put aside their differences to fight for freedom and liberate the world from terrorists.In someone else's hands, ""Team America: World Police"" could have been a very lazy effort, but Parker and Stone breath such life into the proceedings that one can not help but giggle cheerful despite themselves. The movie's title is obviously a knock at neo-con gunboat diplomacy, and right-wing military intervention around the globe is skewered effectively. However, self-righteous liberal filmmakers like Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin and Michael Moore are also trampled as well. The movie turns them into unwitting accomplices to terrorists by degrading American values.""South Park"" creators Parker and Stone continue to show why they're the most brilliant satirists active today. They refuse to take sides, pointing out the shortcomings of both right and left-wing forces, and even suggesting that the two are needed to balance each other out.Like with the ""South Park"" movie, the film has a hilarious musical score. Only this time, the soundtrack is loaded not with spoofs of Broadway and Disney songs, but rather overly-patriotic fluff tunes like a Toby Keith-inspired flag-waving anthem called ""Freedom isn't Free."" Of course there's also the gung-ho going-into-action determination song ""America! F*ck Yeah!"" that wouldn't have been too out of place in a Reagan-era film, and the blatant anti-Bruckheimer love ballad ""Pearl Harbor Sucked, and I Miss You"" which takes some much needed swipes at Michael Bay and his horrible product.The marionette puppet effects add to the zany nature of the film, and the facial expressions on the faces are amazingly well detailed. Of course, the bouncy way the creations walk is also part of the fun, as is the way they slowly move their arms in over-dramatic gestures.That said, the movie is not without its problems. There is of course the much talked about scene of puppet sex between Gary and Lisa. The fact that what's on screen is already pretty disturbing, it makes you wonder just what Parker and Stone had to cut out to secure an R rating. Also, the movie oversimplifies the whole issue of terrorism by making it seem like all extremists are in cahoots, and that a good dose of quick American military action can solve anything.To be fair, as a satire the oversimplication works as long as you don't take it too seriously. There's some smart messages buried in here, as long as you're willing to wade through the violence (puppets bleed, who would have thought?), sex humor and scatological visual effects, including what may be the longest puking scene in film history.What remains is a witty bit of film-making for people who like something different, and that's certainly what ""Team America"" accomplishes with a gusto. While some Hollywood filmmakers insists on drowning their films with self-serving messages, it's good to see a film that lets a puppet holding a machine gun speak for itself.8 out of 10 star. It's good to see Hollywood's sacred cows so thoroughly trashed alongside Bush-era military duplicity.",Team America - World Police
159,henrymadman,X - Rated Thunderbirds,10,8 July 2007,"Team America: World Police is a 2004 film by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the Comedy Central show South Park, shot with marionettes, styled after those in the Supermarionation TV series of British producers Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Anderson. The movie concept was developed after Parker and Stone failed to secure film rights to the Andersons' Thunderbirds.The satire is in the Parker / Stone trademark over-the-top style, and several original songs are reminiscent of the South Park feature film, an earlier project by the same team.10/10",Team America - World Police

How did I know the puppets would do bodily functions on screen in graphic detail? How did I know the F-bomb would go off every other line? However, I found myself chuckling, laughing, and then rolling on the floor with mirth. What a takeoff on the obligatory movie skin scene, hilarious.Any film that lumps Michael Moore, most of the Hollywood actors of liberal persuasion, and France together with Muslim extremists and Korean Dictators has to be commended.

I might even go so far as to say it's worth spending your money to see, but it isn't nearly as funny as it's been made out to be. And funniest movie of the year? Not by a long shot. I laughed, but not hard. It just wasn't that great.I mean, I love satire. I watch ""The Daily Show"" all the time. ""Reno 911"" has made me laugh harder than I ever have in my life. And I'm politically moderate, so I really don't care who they bash. But ""Team America"" simply falls short in the comedy department.

162,aeo,Ha! Ha! Ha! It's stupid funny!,6,18 October 2004,"OK I am going start off by giving this movie six out of ten stars. I would have given it seven if the sex scenes were not deleted but oh well. I read the Los Angeles Times reviews on this movie but they are totally wrong. This movie does not bash liberals in Hollywood or conservatives as some in US media have been saying, instead, this movie is an equal opportunity offender. It bashes everyone!This movie parodies everything from America's position on the war on terrorism to the liberal peace hippies in Hollywood. Some people will probably be turned off by the use of puppets in this movie but I think it is a novel and effective tool to tell the story. Moreover, this is not the first time puppets have been used in movies to tell a story. However, as far as I can tell, I think this is the first time that a full length feature film of puppets has been used to tell a story using adult themes. Certainly it is a creative way to tell the story and yet save money on acting and production cost.I especially wanted to see the sex scenes with the puppets given that it was cut from the movie due to movie ratings board who deemed it too racy. I can tell you it was hilarious to see a female and a male puppet having sex in various positions. I cannot wait to see the uncut DVD release of this movie. Another scene I wanted to see was Sean Penn's parody in this film because he came out and publicly lambasted the makers of this film for ridiculing him on his visit to Iraq awhile ago. Well, he should be lambasted the idiot. He typifies the argument that actors and actresses should stay out of politics and just concentrate their efforts to making movies. Overall, a good attempt by the makers of South Park. I particularly do not like South Park but I liked this movie. My only criticism is that there are pockets of boredom in the movie that stretches for awhile. But what are you going to do.",Team America - World Police
163,Stibbert,Satiric and funny counter bad guys,7,4 October 2005,"This is a satiric and funny movie that's really not that far from the truth. Well, OK, maybe it is that far, but it's still a good movie.Team America is a counter bad guy unit who's mission is to police the world and keep it safe. Their greatest enemy so far is a small and cunning North Korean named Kim Jong Il. His plan is to make 9/11 times 2356! Only hope for Team America is if Gary the actor can infiltrate a cell and reveal his plan.If you're looking for a technical good animation movie this is not it. The creators referred to the animation technique as ""supercrappymation"" and it is. You'll see the strings and it's really just bad. However, this is one of those things that's funny about this movie along with the story. The story is satiric and mocks the usual clichés. It's well written and funny. You'll have no problem seeing the connections to the real world. It may be all the way out on the edge sometimes, but that's the point. The movie does not only mock politics, but movies as well. Half of Hollywood both movies and actors are in there somewhere. All part of the evil plot. That gives everyone something they find funny.There are really not to much to say about the actors. They do a good job in dubbing the puppets. The puppets are also good. They could have been better, but they do the job. The score is really cool. There are some songs with lyrics and there are the score. Both of witch are good. The songs are catchy and easy. You get the lyrics and the meaning with no troubles at all. The score is kind of typical and normal. It could have been used on a normal action movie and I think that makes the whole scene more funny and the parody more obvious.There is not much to say about the cinematography. It works. They've managed to make it pretty close to real. You'll see some shots that could have been from any other movie. It does not have a animated or cartoon look. Just like the score this makes the movie more fun and a bigger parody.Team America World Police is a movie well worth seeing. The satire and humor is excellent and it puts everything all the way out on the edge. It will get you in a good mood and keep you there for a while.",Team America - World Police
164,FilmFan777,Irreverently Hysterical. 'No One' is safe!,8,9 October 2004,"Just came back from a pre-screening and I 'Loved It' No, it's not for kids in the least, total adult humor. Helps a bit if your politically savvy and know a bit about the Hollywood political types, yet either way, if you like South Park type of humor, your in for a load full of laughs.They creatively took most every corny film shot you could think of, plenty of down right nasty language, marionettes getting shot and blown up in some pretty disgusting ways, parody songs that would make anyone blush, pop shots at world leaders, actors (big time), and anyone else you could think of and hit a home run with this as far as I'm concerned.I wont say anymore except that these guys did a great job with this idea and I think it's going to make a mint! If you take it all in humorous perspective and not personally, (have some fun with it), this movie can take the laugh breath right out of you. As it did the whole audience just within the first 15 minutes without even a chance for a second breath.Crude, rude, shrewd, corny, sexual, homophobic, nasty and irreverent will only begin to describe...""Team America World Police"" I hope you enjoy it.",Team America - World Police
165,ericjg623,Team America ROCKS !!,8,31 October 2004,"This movie isn't the least bit subtle - it steals (or pays homage to) the Thunderbirds TV show from the 60's. The characters are all puppets, and, just like the Thunderbirds, they've formed a team that solves problems worldwide using really cool planes, subs, and other devices. Unlike the Thunderbirds, however, they don't rescue people in distress, but rather fight against global terrorism. They may be a little too gung ho in how they go about it (it seems that whenever they pop up, everything around them, from the Eiffel Tower to the Pyramids, gets blown up) but their intentions are good, and in the end they can be counted on to save the day.Of course, this movie is brought to us by the same crew responsible for ""South Park"", so there's plenty of lowbrow humor and scenes designed to offend the overly sensitive. There's puppet sex, and a long dissertation on why it's better to be a dick than an a**hole, but the real joy of this film is watching puppets of sanctimonious Hollywood celebs getting their comeuppance. Honestly, these people already have more fame, adulation, and money than most regular folks could ever conceive of, do they have to then troll for additional brownie points by flaunting their political activism (especially when, most of the time, their understanding of the issues involved is about as deep as a mud puddle). Needless to say, these big shots come in for a nice dose of humiliation courtesy of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. And that's really what it's all about. Just as with ""South Park"", tons of sacred cows get slaughtered in this movie, and the whole thing adds up to a rollicking good time. 8/10",Team America - World Police

167,Thunderbuck,Not their best work,4,18 May 2005,"First off, I'm a BIG Parker & Stone fan. South Park remains the sharpest satire on TV, and the South Park movie (""Bigger, Longer, Uncut"") is on my personal list of funniest movies ever. So I was REALLY looking forward to TEAM America: WORLD POLICE. The whole idea of a movie full of ""Thunderbirds"" style marionettes just seemed so demented.Sad to say, it doesn't work very well here, despite a pretty fair effort. Let me say, the production is awesome. A replica of Times Square early on looks a LOT like the real thing, and lavish effort has been spent on props that are only seen for a few moments (note the detail on the pickup truck that gets washed away when the Panama Canal is blown up).There are a number of problems here, though. The marionettes are remarkably sophisticated, but still come of as, er, wooden. The story doesn't seem to take a particular point of view, but instead skewers all kinds of targets, sometimes at odds with itself. And while I don't have a problem with the frequent lapses into bad taste (these ARE the South Park guys, after all), they don't come off well. The infamous sex scene just became sort of dumb after the first 10 minutes (oh? it wasn't that long? Maybe it just SEEMED like it was an hour...). Yes, as in the South Park movie, the music is pretty good, but it's not enough to redeem the rest of this mess.I guess Parker and Stone are just doomed to live in ""South Park"" forever. That seems to be the only place where they're really funny.",Team America - World Police
168,Space_Lord,The best puppet police team movie ever....,7,3 January 2005,"To be honest I didn't know what to expect when I saw Team America. I knew it was made by the creators of South Park, and with PUPPETS!! This movie is hilarious and so silly, you can't possibly take it seriously! The songs definitely make the movie.. especially the theme song! The characters are fantastic, just about every kind of stereotype you can imagine. From the clean cut All American actor rookie and the long legged vacuous blonde to the evil eyed terrorists and the cunning, reclusive dictator, each character presents a different facet to the film, a lot of personality shows through (not bad for puppets). If the movie suffers in any area it's waiting around for things to happen there are as many boring parts as there are funny, but the sheer audacity and hilarity more than make up for this!! And hopefully the concept of the film will help Americans think about their nation's foreign relations a little more and how they are perceived by the rest of the world. Cheers Matt and Trey!!! A job well done!",Team America - World Police
169,neon47,You'll laugh until you're watter logged.,9,15 May 2005,"Lots of people said that this movie looks stupid because it's done with puppets. Lots of people were wrong... very wrong. Team America is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long long time. The AIDs song was enough to put my friend into a laughing submission for literally 10mins. The strings in the movie remain shown to add the fake effect. The overall story is pretty decent. I'd like to theorize that this movie was created as a moral booster to Americans due to the war and all. The way they make fun of actors in this movie is great. Lets just say this: Film Actors Guild (I think you can figure that one out). The violence near the end is almost non-stop and utterly hilarious as Trey Parker and Matt Stone go as far as to liquidate some of the puppets. The songs in general are funny as well, the theme song being called ""America (Fuck Yeah)"". Puppet sex is laugh out loud hilarious, I honestly think they do every position imaginable. So basically, if you don't like puppet sex, constant swearing, huge amounts of violence, and funny songs then don't watch this movie. In fact go kill yourself, because this is probably the funniest movie that you'll ever see for a long time.",Team America - World Police
170,dj_xand325,"Brave, Controversial and Hilarious Piece of Comedy",8,4 September 2007,"""Have you seen a man eat his own head?"" Trey parker and Matt stone do it again with this refreshingly funny and courageous film. Matt and Trey of course are the creators of the brilliant south park and we all know how good that movie was.Insulting Americans happens to be one of my favourite hobbies :D (sorry Americans) and this film makes fun of American Issues such as Dumn Hollywood Actors, Americans thinking they're the greatest and Americans general low IQ. Team American manages to insult the wide range of people like Egyptians, French people, Arabs, Koreans, Matt Damon :D, Freddie Mercury and many more. Therefore this is probably the most offensive movie of all time and i love it!.Also the movie spoofs the classic hit ""thunderbirds"" in the context of, taking the holy hell out of the strings being clearly visible and the puppetry being shoddily done and making the base being in a ridiculous place i.e. in mount Rushmore. This film also parodies Kill Bill, Pearl Harbour, Matrix and again many more.This film also manages to take the pi*s out of stereotypical action films, in the way that, in the middle of serious action sequences a character would stop and talk about a deep matter in their life in the most inappropriate time. This happens frequently in action films.Have you ever played with your sisters Barbie and Ken dolls making them do sexual positions? (come on you know you have). Well the sex scene is just Trey parker doing that, simply hilarious.This is THE most action packed puppet movie ever made and therefore is a big achievement in comedy and therefore deserves positive reviews.In conclusion, this is most probably the most offensive film of all time which makes it hilarious and a fun to watch classic 8.3/10",Team America - World Police

It was so hysterical that I spurted soda out my nose, of which I will never live down.My favorite scene is the super duper barf scene. I didn't know someone could actually barf five times their body weight. After watching the movie, me and the mrs. tried all the sex positions and it was just as herky jerky as in the movie. The only thing I can say is that if you ever watched Kill Bill, you must see this movie. I don't know how many other movies were mocked, maybe someone can fill me in. I will have to buy this movie and send it to all of my friends so that we can sing all the songs as Christmas carols. Loved this movie, will have it buried with me.",Team America - World Police
172,jhs39,Disappointing,4,24 October 2004,"Hugely disappointing comedy by South Park creators is only intermittently amusing and generally plays too much like a real Jerry Bruckenheimer movie. Parker and Stone apparently thought it would be funny to do a Bruckenheimer film where the characters are played by ""wooden actors"" rather than wooden actors, but that joke can only carry the movie for about ten minutes. The songs nearly save the day--too bad this wasn't a musical like the South Park movie. But much of the comedy is flat, mean-spirited, uninspired and, I hate to say, remarkably right-wing. While the opening scene in which Team America destroys Paris during an anti-terrorist operation gives the impression of a satire of American aggression and the inability to take into account anyone's interests or perspective other than our own, the filmmakers' sympathies are ultimately very squarely in Team America's corner. Stone and Parker ridicule the idea that American actions abroad might actually encourage terrorism, a key criticism of the consequences of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq. It's hard to view the ending as anything other than a ringing endorsement for the Bush administration, which might explain why their TV program That's My Bush was so toothless and lame--these guys are closet right-wing Republicans. Maybe if Comedy Central ever cancels their show they can take their act to the Fox News Network. One local critic said that this movie could have been written by Donald Rumsfield. I wouldn't go quite that far, but Team America isn't the even handed satire that Parker and Stone are claiming in interviews. It's far to the right of the original South Park movie, which maybe wouldn't matter that much if it was funnier. Bush apologists and people who think entertainers are too stupid to have valid political opinions should get a kick out of Team America. Me, I'll stick with Orgazmo and the South Park movie. Even Cannibal The Musical was funnier than this.",Team America - World Police
173,colettesplace,a rootin' tootin' puppet blockbuster,7,14 March 2006,"They're famous for South Park  the TV series and the film, and the cult film Orgazmo (1997). Not to mention frocking up as JLo and Gynneth Paltrow at the Oscars four years ago. Now Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the two professionals of political incorrectness, bring puppets to the big screen in an action adventure spoof literally inspired by Jerry Bruckheimer.The plot: actor Gary Johnston is recruited from Broadway to join a unique special ops team. While fighting terrorists and saving the world from destruction, he and the Team America crew destroy several world monuments and come under fire from the liberal Film Actors Group, or FAG.Everyone gets a serve in this musical comedy, but some insults are greater than others. Firstly, the carelessness and moral superiority with which this team conducts themselves reflects American foreign policy over the last 50 years.Secondly, it's unlikely that Parker and Stone will be working with any A-listers any time soon after socking it to power players like Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Matt Damon. The obligatory love song features a chorus line lampooning a Ben Affleck flick: ""Pearl Harbour sucked almost as much as I miss you"". While FAG leader Alec Baldwin (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is described as the greatest actor in the world  which got a huge chuckle from the audience.However, despite the splatter gun approach to social commentary, there is genuine bite behind Team America: World Police. Although it has been criticised for attacking well-known actors, the film actually attacks celebrity culture, rather than politically active individuals. Indeed, why should the opinion of George Clooney or Helen Hunt be any more important than anyone else's? The argument that Parker and Stone attack celebrity culture rather than celebrities is supported by the way Johnston's acting ability is regarded in the film. It's a superpower. Although it's never described as a Jedi skill, there are several references to Star Wars and, in one scene, Johnston plays the Jedi mind trick (Phantom Menace-style) on the guards: ""You did not see me. I was never here."" The ridiculous regard for acting in Team America: World Police reinforces the inflated regard the public has for actors in general.CGI animate the puppets at some stages  and is then removed, emphasising their 'woodenness' (watch out for the ultra-lame billiards shot). Despite or even because of this, it's uncanny just how similar Team America is to its sincere blockbuster cousins. Or perhaps it's because of the film's impressively credentialed production design team, with Director of Photography Bill Pope coming direct from Spiderman 2, while special effects were courtesy of Joe Viscocil (an Academy Award® winner for Independence Day). Despite a modest budget, Team America was able to achieve some killer special effects, as scale models of monuments such as the Sphinx and Mount Rushmore only needed to be one-third of the size required for films with human actors.Team America: World Police is very entertaining and rather intelligent, with less of an indulgence in 'potty-mouthed' humour than expected from Parker and Stone. Except for the long projectile vomit scene and the truly unforgettable puppet sex sequence (but hey, as long as it's between consenting marionettes). And watch out for the truly spectacular panther attack.Warning: you may find yourself singing the theme song: Team America, F#&% Yeah!, when you leave this movie. Try and do it under your breath, or you may offend almost as many people as Parker and Stone have over the years.",Team America - World Police

In fact, there are only two funny scenes in the entire movie. Both combined last 2 minutes out of the 130+ minute runtime.It started good, it got worse and ended in the dumpster.

If I had to compare the two, I would believe that the South Park movie was better, but that does not mean Team America is a lot worse.First off, the fact that these two (Trey and Matt) created a 90 minute movie with only using puppets is incredible (Especially in the beginning, having a puppet move another puppet on the streets in Paris). The creation of each puppet and all the scenery must have taken 6 months alone. After watching it for half an hour, you forget that they are puppets, and this creates the movie feeling.The comedy was excellent, this movie was hilarious. The choreography was good, like South Park's was in their movie. The songs will become repetitive in your head after constantly watching, and this is something each movie achieved.

But I had faith. Good thing, too.This movie is frickin' hilarious. I haven't laughed that hard at the movies since....well, since I saw the South Park movie in the theater. At one point I was laughing so hard I was actually crying. Is it stupid? Oh hell yeah, but it's supposed to be, and I loved every minute of it. My wife even agreed to see it, but had low expectations. Even she was laughing her ass off. I could tell she was embarrassed how much she enjoyed this flick. There are moments of sheer genius in this movie, which I won't ruin for you, and I gotta see if there's a soundtrack for it. After seeing it, I caught a lot of interviews and clips which I'm glad I hadn't seen beforehand. Don't watch any of it, you'll ruin the best parts.So basically the marketing of this movie sucked. If I judged only by the trailer, I'd have never seen this. Worse yet, it gives no indication of how crude the movie is. Basically the same level as the South Park movie.

The movie is done with puppets. That's mainly why it's so funny. One of the funniest scenes, if not the funniest scene is where these two puppets have sex in a variety of positions. That made me laugh harder than I think I ever have at anything else. There are outrageous hilarious lines in this. The creators of it are the creators of South Park and they are very brilliant and hilarious guys. This movie is hilarious in the extreme. Given the comedic genius of South Park, it isn't surprising this is so funny.",Team America - World Police
181,stargunner,Team America Checklist,10,25 October 2004,"The one thing I noticed while attempting to breathe during this movie was that people were walking out in between bursts of hysterical laughter.Unfortunately, this movie is not for everyone. I wish it didn't offend some but it does. So, if you want to know whether you will enjoy this film or not, you must answer ""yes"" to the following:1. I am not offended by the ""F"" word. Being repeated 300 times.2. I am not offended by intense marionette sex.3. I am not offended by racial satire.4. I am not offended by ridiculous political satire.5. I am not a member of the Film Actor's Guild.If you're like me and have answered ""yes"" to the above five questions, go see this film. You will laugh so hard it will hurt and you will giggle about it for the next week thereafter.I have to say that I am very desensitized when it comes these kinds of films, and I'd say that Team America has raised the bar in derogatory humor. But that only made it more hilarious. I give it 5 stars, two thumbs up, 10 out of 10; it was flawless. But...On the other hand, if you're not like me, you might find yourself walking out by the third time you hear the song, ""America, F*** Yeah!""",Team America - World Police
182,DaRick89,"Very funny beginning, but then slips...great puppetry though",7,10 January 2006,"Just after my school year ended, I saw Team America: World Police. I had heard a lot about how mad it was (from teenagers, of course), for instance: ""Adurkadurkastan!"" and other such stuff. These praisings seemed to be true after the first 5-10 minutes, when the film had most of the family laughing. I myself was laughing harder than I had in weeks. But then the quality of the comedy slipped until, at the end, Gary, the typical 'tortured hero', had a lengthy, unnecessary and off-putting talk about 'c*****, p****** and a*******'.The plot revolves around this team of superheroes 'Team America' who supposedly serve to protect humanity from the evils of terrorism, yet ending up ruining everything around them doing so. It's clearly a commentary on Iraq and Afghanistan: it doesn't matter if you screw the country's infrastructure up, just rid the country of evil! This is evident in a scene where they destroy the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, leaving people shocked and me laughing my head off. Ditto in Egypt, where the Sphinx and Ramses are demolished. After losing a member, Gary, a Broadway actor is enlisted by Team America leader Spostwoode. This is where the quality of the comedy stars to ebb, as Spostwoode says ""Gary, suck my c***."" Unfortunately, Gary does suck his c*** later on, in a scene which I feel is the worst in the film, partially because it carries homosexual overtones. As for the notorious 'puppet sex' scene, it did bring a brief smile to my face, but that's about it. The 'Pearl Harbor sucks a bit more than I miss you' song was pretty funny, but preludes the c***-sucking scene, reducing its impact. The 'Team America F*** yeah!' song was funny the first time, but was overplayed. I did not expect much wit here, as this was coming from the makers of South Park, but there is one clever acronym: Film Actors Guild, which sounds harmless, but spells FAG.As for the characters themselves, they are stereotypes. Gary is the angst-ridden hero you've seen a thousand times elsewhere, Lisa is Gary's 'scarred' love interest, Sarah is the weirdo, Chris is the hothead, Joe is the 'wise man', Spotswoode is the suave leader. Of these characters, only Spotswoode garners laughs. As for Chris, I think he is an unlikeable p****, even after he reveals that he got raped. On a more positive note, the puppetry here is very good; quite unlike anything I've seen in any other film. For instance, they can vomit, bleed and have sex. How you get a puppet to do these things I will never know, but like I said, it's remarkable. The wires are visible, but that's probably meant to a recurring gag, so I'll refrain from criticising it. The 'Adurkadurkastan' line: ""It must be those Adurkadurkastanis again"" is worth a laugh, and the way that Kim Jong Il is portrayed is funny in parts (like shooting his translator in the head for no reason and being unable to pronounce his l's properly: ""Hans Brix"" and ""I'm so ronery""). The parts where they say: ""That's the best acting I've ever seen"" is a little funny too.In the end, like Top Gun, 'Team America: World Police' is worth a look for its technical attributes, the only difference being that whereas Top Gun had excellent cinematography, Team America has excellent puppetry. It's sense of comedy is 'hit-and-miss', unfortunately missing more as the film goes on. If you are an educated cinemagoer looking for 'smart comedy', you shouldn't come anywhere near this, but if you are a teenager, I say watch it.I'm giving to round my overall mark from two marks, which will give you a clearer view on my overall thoughts on Team America: Technical quality: 5/5 Comedy: 3/5 Overall: 3.5/5 stars (rounded down)",Team America - World Police
183,segratz,"If You Like South Park, You'll LOVE This",8,12 October 2004,"Let me start by saying this isn't a political movie and there is little smart satirical political comedy. Instead, this is a spoof film (a la ""Naked Gun"") on Jerry Bruckheimer films and approaching it from that viewpoint, it's pretty hilarious. Of course everything is done with puppets, which are actually cool looking. The sets are what amazed me the most: I was expecting cheap cheesy props and instead there are elaborate miniatures of France, Times Square, and Mount Rushmore (and many more). You can see where the producers sinked there money. There are also a lot of musical numbers (a la ""South Park"") since Parker writes music, and they too are pretty funny in a very immature kind of way.My theater was full of every kind of person imaginable. There were two elderly couples in front of us: one couple laughed the entire movie, the other not at all (I think the other couple was expecting something smarter). There were also a lot of little kids and they, of course, were shocked (I'm sure) but they squealed with laughter during many of the fighting scenes. NOT a movie for young kids though I would say unless you want them spewing four letter words! Make sure you stay till the end of the credits to get a bonus song. Overall I'd say if you're a fan of South Park, you're going to enjoy this movie. If you're not a fan you're going to think it was a big waste of money!",Team America - World Police

Any other movie I would have taken back but decided it was worth a rewatch.The celebrity who came off the worst had to be Matt Damon who was smart enough to remember his name. Remembering a radio add for the movie, Damon wasn't offended by the movies portrayal of him, in fact he would have been if he wasn't in the movie.The FAG (film actor guild) had me in tears, the puppet violence was as realistic as it could be.It goes to show that men will say anything to get some, as we hear Gary say 'ill never die' before the many positioned sex puppet scene which goes on for quite a while.Kim Jong sounds exactly like Cartman from South Park.At the end, my nephew was saying 'America **** yeah'.Time to watch this one again.",Team America - World Police

This movie may not get the Oscar nod (even tho it should) but it should sweep the MTV Video Awards - for Best Villain, Best Love Scene, Best Fight Scene - etc. etc. I loved this movie from beginning to end even the puck scene. I can't wait for the DVD with all the scenes deleted from this masterpiece of world cinema. The F.A.G. scenes were priceless, the songs were exquisite - I don't know them all so I will have to buy the CD - but ""I'm Ronely"" was a standout. Seeing Michael Moore get blown up was worth the price of admission & hearing him referred to as a ""commie weasel"" had me in stitches.

186,pandabat,Where did it all go wrong?,2,9 February 2005,"Before I start, let me say that I love South Park. I love the series, I love the movie and I even love that little cartoon that appears in ""Bowling For Columbine"" which is South Park-related. I didn't expect the world of ""Team America World Police"" (TAWP) but I did expect to have a couple of memorable moments. How wrong could I have been? The start of the movie is where the best comedic moments are to be had. The carefree way in which TAWP destroy Paris in pursuit of terrorists brings a wry smile to the face and even the musical ""Lease"" is a good attempt at a send up. However, from here on in it's a roller-coaster ride to humour-hell. Gags such as the puppet-love scene and the post-drinking vomit scene roll on and on for far too much time, and certainly long after they were in any way funny! The music's pretty dire too but with the added, unfortunate quality that it will stick in your head and drive you mad for some time after viewing the movie.Yes, the marionettes are nice, the sets have good attention to detail and everything is produced in a slick, professional way but the film is let down by a poor plot and an even poorer script.Ultimately this was a fantastic idea that I really wanted to see succeed. Just goes to show that you can't always get what you want and, alas, it will go down in my memory as one of the most disappointingly bad movies I have ever seen!",Team America - World Police
187,Essex_Rider,Utterly superb!,10,31 October 2007,"This works on many levels in that it uses three of the best elements of theatre.  Irony  Subtlety  SatireFirst let's take irony. I'm not really sure if Americans can see the irony in the opening scene. Sure, the World Police get the terrorists and retrieve the WMD's, all it cost was the destruction of the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysées, the Eiffel Tower and the The Louvre and the Tuileries. It's the wonderful expressions on the faces of the marionettes as they survey the scenes of devastation. This theme is carried on when they land in a desert oasis, crushing all and sundry and telling the locals that they are their friends.The subtlety is wonderful, it reminded me of South Park (The Movie) where Saddam is in bed with the devil. It was clear they meant that the U.S (The Great Satan) had indeed been 'in bed' with Saddam Hussein. The wonderful rendition of Kim Jong-il and the ease he suckers the F.A.G (Film Actors Guild) is wickedly funny because it shows how easy the liberal elite follow fashionable causes (in this case, the illusion of peace). The satire is brilliant because it is shared among everyone. It seems that nobody is spared the ruthless satire, but it must me said, the funniest of all is where Gary Johnston, still clearly American, fools the Muslim terrorists with a mid western accent and stick on stubble over the face. To me, the creators are saying that America has such a misguided belief in itself, the whole world can be fooled.",Team America - World Police
188,Workin_Man,The Most Gut Bustingly Hilarious Movie I've Ever Seen,10,23 April 2006,"It took me a while to see this movie but I finally rented it last night and man I was impressed!! This movie made me laugh so damn much!! It is easily the most hysterical movie of 2004. I was in tears during some scenes!! I loved the idea of puppets in the movie instead of real people. To me that makes the movie 10 times funnier. Which is hard to believe since the movie itself would have been hilarious with real people. I thought it was a great idea to use puppets in this movie. It really made the movie unique and enjoyable to watch. So, all in all, puppets really made this film a very special film and it was very enjoyable to watch.Like I said before, this film is just absolutely hysterical. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comedic geniuses. With their smash hit TV show South Park, The South Park Movie, and now Team America, these guys have really moved up in the entertainment business. I'm sure they have lots more ideas up their sleeves that are just bound to become smash hits. I can't wait to see these guys' work in 10 years time. My prediction is that in 10 years time, South Park will still be going strong, Trey and Matt will have come up with another hit TV show, and Trey and Matt will eventually become the kings of comedy. In conclusion, Team America is by far, the best comedic film of 2004 and my favorite film so far this century.",Team America - World Police

190,toonyjakes,"Not for everyone, but easily one of the funniest ever",10,18 September 2018,"Team America is one of those rare comedy films that not only is a spoof, but an original one at that. Let's get one thing straight though, if you're not into South Park or that kind of humor, this movie may or may not be for you. Plot: The plot is essentially about Team America trying to stop Kim Jong Il, and they essentially destroy everything in the process. There are really no dull moments in the film, but it doesn't have some mind blowing plot- it doesn't need one.Writing: This movie cracks me up after seeing it dozens of times. The first puppet fight is just purely hilarious, totally playing off of the whole puppet aspect to make something anyone could laugh at. The musical rendition of Rent, Kim Jong Il's character, the infamous sex scene, almost everything about the movie is funny.Acting: The voice acting is pure gold to me. Just like in South Park, Matt Stone & Trey Parker voice most of the characters, which i always thought makes it even funnier. They always have a fake language for most other ethnicities, which I think is funny but maybe some would be offended? I wouldn't see why. It's all comedy. Quality: The set designs are awesome, seamlessly utilizing random objects alongside professional designs. The puppeteering is great, and is bad when it wants to be funny. The music score is great and has a very funny theme song. It's no poorly done film by any standard.Overall this is one of my favorite comedy films, I consider it a classic for sure. The satire is awesome, the dialogue is funny, clever, and sometimes purposefully stupid. If you're creeped out by puppets or get very very easily offended, stay away. Otherwise it will definitely make you laugh.",Team America - World Police

193,galahad58,String Cheese,7,16 October 2004,"A review about Team America is very difficult to write. I will not go into the storyline, since you can read that on any of the movie sites; I will just write a few comments about Team America.Team America is a comedy featuring marionette puppets. If you have ever been a fan of the Thunderbirds or of Captain Scarlet then you are familiar with the marionette puppet form of entertainment. Team America is NOT for everyone. Team America is lude, crude, harsh, loud, proud, silly, hilarious, all combined into one movie. If you are a fan of South Park, the same creative team, then you will be entertained. I see this movie as a combination of South Park, Thunderbirds and Naked Gun. Personally, I enjoyed this film. I enjoyed the way the producers really did not take sides and made left wing and right wing both ridiculous. The film shows how both sides create destruction and mayhem while carrying out their policies and beliefs. I also liked the way the producers took shots at ignorant Hollywood actors that try and FORCE their uneducated, uninformed political views upon America. Actors that use their image to help push uneducated, uninformed, and easily swayed American youth into voting booths to vote for something they do not fully understand. Seeing Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon and Michael Moore get wasted is worth the entry fee in itself.Some of the ludeness does go overboard: the puppet sex got the laughs in the first couple of seconds (and this is an edited version---damn, guess the uncut version would have starred Jenna Jamison), but did not need to continue on for a couple of minutes. There are plenty of laughs for the audience and an open minded person will be entertained. I would buy this when released on DVD and give it a 7 overall rating--without the puppet sex, I would have rated it an 8.5.",Team America - World Police
194,uroskin,Team America: F*** yeah!,5,23 July 2007,"There really was no escape from eventually watching ""Team America: World Police"", especially since I am such a fan of Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlett - the puppet versions, naturellement. I've always suspected Col. White was the boss of Lt Green, the way the Col. always expected his every whim attended to. And for Scarlett and Blue, well, they were spending so much time cooped up in their ship voluntarily even the usual excuse of situational homosexuality didn't really stick. I was curious whether it would be as campily funny as the Gerry Anderson art work, and, of course, it was not: it was all rather crude and predictable once the premise of ""trying to offend everyone"" has been made clear. On the other hand the film was technically and cinematically done gorgeously. If only they had some funny Brits working on the script it would have been twice as funny. The so-called controversial puppetry sex scenes I thought were rather vapid and tame. I mean, how hard is it for puppets to get wood? Surely there would have been gags lurking in there, but no, on screen sex apparently (judging by the sheer number of mentions of this scene in film reviews) is taken very seriously. Not much, though, about the hilarious gay blowjob scene. At the other end, the vomit scene was done better in Meet the Feebles.My gaydar was going off hugely when watching the accompanying interview with Trey Parker and the behind the scenes documentaries on the DVD extras. All those gay/homo/homophobia references, also very noticeable in South Park, point to a knowing. I was disappointed that one scene was cut: where Gary comes up after giving his boss a blowjob to prove he's with them (I shudder to think President Bush will instigate a similar test to prove your loyalty and patriotism) and the boss says: ""You're gay now"". If only one had scenes like that in action movies involving Vin Diesel of Bruce Willis in that situation, it may make them watching worth my while. Vin wiping his chin after a blowjob would be worth the admission price by itself.",Team America - World Police
195,nEoFILM,Comedy of the decade?,10,31 October 2011,"America! F**K YEAH! The theme's lyrics sum up this movie as well as any could have. Made in the midst of the War On Terror in 2004, a satire was needed and who better to provide one than the satirical genius' Trey Parker and Matt Stone, best known for South Park. On the surface, this looks like a straight forward bawdy adult puppet parody, taking the mickey out of Bruckheimer's blockbusters, Thunderbirds and the reputation being acquired by the U.S. over the past 30 years but reaching boiling point over the last decade, certainly in a post 9/11 world.But that's just the tip of the iceberg. This is looking into every major aspect of the above, such as chauvinism, the political interference and undue, and sometimes dangerous influence of celebrities, summed up here with the Film Actor's Guild (or F.A.G.) with a host of major film stars ripped off, notably upsetting Sean Penn. The infamous puppet sex scene, which is nothing more than a poke, pardon the pun, at the puppetry employed in the film.But there's so much more such as the excellent selection of bespoke songs, such as ""Only A Woman"" for the sex scene, ""End Of An Act"" as our hero leaves the group to wallow in self-pity to the song with features verse after verse nothing more than slagging off Michael Bay's, Pearl Harbor and Ben Afleck! But for a film with criticises these blockbusters, it understands them too well to be truly nasty about them.The entire film IS a well made Bruckheimer film, even recruiting one of his regular composers, Harry Gregson-Williams, to be in at the last- minute, to compose a great score, but why do this if they hated it so much? They don't; they love these films and the affection for the genre is clear, making their digs enjoyable and not hurtful There's even a contradiction with the political tract as one hand this would seem to be an anti-American tome where Team America blow up every city and landmark imaginable in order to protect the world from the destruction of the Terrorists Get it?On the other, the song entitled ""Freedom Isn't Free"" would seem to suggest that we should all do our part, even though this number ends with the line, ""Freedom cost a buck o'five"" But then after all the political and social satire, and the spoofing of Hollywood's gung-ho films, it's just a fun film.When the terrorist's come from Derka Derkastan, the tone is clear. This is like a pair of boys playing ""War On Terror"" with a collection of action figures. They're clearly laughing hysterically as they write, produce and direct this film like two teenagers, as they create the highly insensitive language of the terrorists, use elements from films such as Star Wars and James Bond, certainly as for Kim Jong-il, is nobody safe, well not after offending the North Korean leader, but in all fairness, this is really just Eric Cartman from South Park.But in the end, this is the perfect satire, with a blend of real world political and social commentary, great spoofing but when all's said and done, this has a great sense if humour, though at times, somewhat bawdy. This is brilliant and one of, if not the best comedy of the past decade, and one of the greatest satires of all time. And, no, I don't believe that I'm over stating that",Team America - World Police
196,ClassicAndCampFilmReviews,"""Putting the 'F' back in freedom!""",8,19 May 2005,"Just released on DVD this week, ""Team America: World Police"" is going to be a instant cult classic; buy an extra copy to sell on E-Bay some day for a ridiculously high price. ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have outdone themselves with this puppet-populated parody, and have said that they plan to never repeat the experience because of the amount of trouble involved. I admire these guys; they must have lived to watch stop-motion animation and puppet shows when they were kids, because ""Team America"" is obviously a labor-intensive labor of love.The plot: Team America, an international police force of puppets, are sworn to uphold world peace. When they find out that a power-mad dictator wants to take over the world, using terrorists as helpers, they convince actor Gary Johnston to help them with his amazing powers of...acting. The Film Actors' Guild, or F.A.G., as they are known, are opposed to Team America and will stop at nothing to foil their plan.Typical of Parker and Stone, ""Team-America"" is vulgar, nasty, obnoxious, offensive to everyone and everything, chock-full of sex and violence, and certainly not for the faint of heart or anyone with a politically correct sense of humor. In other words, it's hilarious! And then there's the almost creepy (but funny) experience of sometimes forgetting that one is watching puppets, not people. Well, nowadays when it seems that many actresses are having Botox injections to the degree that their facial features resemble puppets anyway...! So it makes sense.If the ""Team America"" theatrical release didn't get the ""R"" rating for the language, it certainly got it for the explicit puppet sex scene. Or the explicit puppet violence. Or the soundtrack. Go figure! And there's an unrated, uncensored version available (which I promptly ordered from Amazon). Parker and Stone's G.I. Joe dolls or whatever action figures they had as children must have been put through the wringer.The puppets are amazingly well-executed and manipulated, the celebrity ones are the icing on the cake, and the writing is what we've all come to expect from Parker and Stone. If you love the ""South Park"" TV show and the ""South Park"" film, you'll love this...if not, then you'll want to stay away. And no celebrity voices here, just Parker and Stone getting by with the help of a couple of friends.Enough said.

OK, I knew this movie was about puppets. I knew they would walk and talk like puppets. Trey Parker and Matt Stone use all their jokes and just repeat them over and over and over and over. I'll name them all for you, because otherwise you'll think i'm lying. Thr way the puppets walk (Alot of the time they try and get humor out of the the way the puppets walk such as at the beginning when Chris was fighting the terrorist, when Kim Jong Ill told the terrorist to get the f outta there then he walked funny, and the karate scenes near the end), The national anthem ""AMERICA F YEAH"", the way the terrorists speak, one of the terrorists saying (repeating) ""you have balls"", Gary doing the symbol for when he was in trouble in the car, Team America blowing up popular symbols of countries (The Eifel Tower and the Pyramids in Egypt), Team America just driving/landing wherever they want, Sarah's sense on been able to clear people's mind, the puppet sex (they just kept repeating the puppet sex with as many gross things with the boobs, penises and butt as much as they could until we laughed), Kim Jong Ill using the word ""Herro"" instead of ""Hello"" and whenever he couldn't pronounce the word ""L"", such as the words ""Ronery, crever, Arc Barrwin"" etc, the FA.G. standing for Film Actor's Guild, ""The Pearl Harbor sucks"" song, the vomit scene with Gary (They just repeated that until we laughed) and much more. I just didn't find any of it funny or amusing. I did however smile when they were killing the actors, that was slightly amusing. The puppetry was well done. The puppeteers had great talent in moving the puppets. the movie isn't boring, it moves well. It's just that it isn't funny.

199,jaysilentbob37,Funnier than watching George Bush address the nation.,8,30 December 2005,"And that's really funny (Just kidding, for all you Bush enthusiasts). This is another political satire from Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Their other popular movie is the wildly entertaining ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut."" ""Team America"" is just as great as the South Park movie. While South Park took a look the MPAA, and censorship, this one bashes politics, and action movies.It's about a team of Americans who go around the world fighting terrorists, and obliviously destroying everything in their path (The Eifel Tower, The Pyramids). When one team member is killed, the leader, Spottswoode, recruits Gary Johnston. Gary is a Broadway actor, and the team thinks that he could use his acting skills to infiltrate terrorists. He falls in love with a team member, Lisa, and goes through with his mission. However, things go wrong, and Team America ends up pissing off the entire world. This prompts a group of Hollywood actors to take a stand. Meanwhile, the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Il, is planning something big for the world...Team America takes cheesy action movie clichés, uses them to the extreme, and makes them hilarious. The hero who is haunted by the past, the lame stunts, a scene where everyone gets mad at each other, a romance (which includes the clichéd sex scene, and it exaggerates it by not making it passionate and romantic, but pornographic, explicit, vulgar, and drop dead hilarious. The puppets are the only reason this scene didn't make the movie NC-17), and an ""uplifting"" speech at the end that saves humanity. It's all there, and is priceless comedic material. If this movie weren't performed with puppets, it would probably qualify as the worst action movie ever made. This movie ruthlessly satirizes everyone and everything, and nothing is sacred. The film bashes (nearly) every race, and many political figures (how George Bush managed to escape without being parodies is beyond me). The majority of the satire doesn't exist in vulgar slurs and insults, and all-out racism. Whenever each race is depicted, the stereotypes surrounding them are all depicted the way action clichés are used. This is the most politically incorrect movie I've ever seen, and it has something to offend everyone.Hollywood actors in this movie only exist to be shot, blown up, or killed in other gruesome ways. The actor who gets made fun of the worst is Matt Damon, who's character only says ""MATT DAMON!"" in a really retarded voice. Luckily, his death isn't as over the top as the other actors. The actors are all a part of the organization called the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.).The songs in this movie are hilarious. This isn't a musical like the South Park movie. The songs in this play on the soundtrack, and while they play like normal songs, they are actually funny songs that were made for this movie. Songs include a love song about how ""Pearl Harbor Sucked, and I Miss You. There's also a song in which Kim Jong Il sings about how ronery (lonely) he is. This is a hilarious movie, and I give it 10/10.It is rated R for Graphic, Crude and Sexual humor, Violent Images, and Strong Language- All Involving Puppets.

200,RNHunter,Quite Funny - for adults,10,2 October 2006,"This movie can be quite funny for most of us. Keep in mind though to put the youngsters to bed. The language is beyond adult, and the puppet sex scene (actually marionettes) can be too much for some.When one gets beyond the vulgarities the movie is refreshingly funny. Unlike many comedians nowadays who laugh at those they do not like and are unable to laugh at themselves, the South Park creators continue their even keel approach. Their approach is to laugh at everything. No group escapes South Park. So, keep in mind that regardless of what politics you may have or religious inclination, that South Park will eventually pick on your group also. However, that does give us a chance to laugh at ourselves - something that can be therapeutic. We can laugh at ourselves because we know that the emphasis will soon shift to other belief systems that will also get their turn of laughter. South Park seems to have no ideology. They simply seem to ask, what is funny about this group or that, and then put it on film.And beyond all of that, the South Park writers are clearly quite intelligent. So the humor abounds. South Park even laughs at itself. There are a few scenes that marionettes simply cannot do, such as street fights, yet they do it anyway. And that just makes it so much funnier.So, this movie is not for everyone. If you do not wish adult language or very adult sex scenes (even with puppets) you may be offended by this movie. However, if you can get past that, you might find this one of the funniest movies you have ever seen.",Team America - World Police

I usually don't laugh out loud in theaters but there were times when I couldn't help myself.

202,m_jordan_jones,the worst movie I've ever seen (may contain spoilers),1,17 June 2005,this movie is really awful. If you like south park don't watch this. This movie is to cheap and stupid to even compete with south park. The puppets are really cheap looking and you can see the strings for the puppets. If you see this at your local blockbuster or Hollywood don't rent it. That's even to much for this film. Just avoid the film. I couldn't even make it through five minutes of this crap. I would rather puke up my insides. Heck I would rather watch the grass grow for the next five years before I even think about trying to make it through this horrible film again.

203,LydiaOLydia,Well below expectations,4,7 November 2005,"I approached this movie knowing full well that it would be full of South Park-esquire language and bathroom humor. Team America: World Police did not disappoint there (including the obligatory mannequin gratuitous sex scenes). My relatively negative review has nothing to do with this.Rather, this movie was a disappointment because it was opportunity wasted. The directors started with a novel and superb concept: a self-aware parody and critique of America as global policeman and spent the rest of the movie watering it down. Nowhere except for the title was there a real play on the neocon fantasy that should have been at the core, or at least, at very minimum, a significant part of the movie. Instead, the movie seems to think that the title is as much of a jab to the right as is necessary, so it spends the rest of the movie basically making gross out jokes and jabbing at a caricature of the left. I don't think I'm giving too much away by noting that in this movie the terrorist threat is very real (as opposed to mostly imagined, as would have been more appropriate for a good tongue in cheek 'World Police' movie) and that Hollywood liberals are pictured as both the willing and/or unwitting accomplices of terrorists and crackpots.Look - I've nothing against some right wingers making their own movie. And, perhaps in some bizarre way some might see this movie as trying to be 'even handed' in its jabs. But the fact is that in 2004, when this movie was made, there was a Republican President and Republican control of both houses of senate and so the last thing that was really necessary at this point was a movie that at first glance appeared to be mocking the USA but in the end whose main political 'point' was to lump Alec Baldwin and Kim Jung Il together.But you might say - ""it's not supposed to be political--it's just supposed to be funny."" Ya, well, swing and a miss there, too. This movie is the epitome of opportunity wasted.",Team America - World Police
204,Serva,Disappointing,2,4 February 2005,"When first hearing about this movie and seeing the trailer, one could easily get the idea that this is a film trying to take a side and really satirize about how America is policing the world. Which, in fact, they are. Personally, I later on heard that a member of the dear duo behind South Park heard a second person saying something to this effect, and hearing this fueled, Parker or Trey whoever it was, to make this film. And to not take a side but to satirize and make fun of ""both sides"" - so to speak.Matt Stone and Trey Parker should get a dictionary and find the word hyperbolic statement. It is a rhetoric method of getting one's point across. In no way ""America"", ""The Real America"" as it is described at one point in this film, or let's say USA, are policing the world driving around in police cars or whatever. It's just ignorant to think that. Saying the US armed forces are policing the world is an exaggeration. I can't believe I'm writing this because it should be very clear to any thinking individual. Now you don't have to agree with this, but none the less that's what it means.Not taking any sides is OK, but this movie is just too ambiguous for the audience to get any sort of idea whether Stone and Parker really are taking sides or not. It comes across as if in fact they are taking sides with the idea that the US's intervention in foreign countries is OK, or even for the better. I'm not going to go into that discussion, but it seems the makers of this film tried to make a story about a subject they lack insight in. Politics is something VERY hard to satirize, since it's a sensitive issue that a majority of people have an opinion about. It's a fat chance you're gonna step on many persons toes no matter what kind of message you're trying to put across.Granted some parts are really funny, you kind of choke on a lot of your laughter, thinking about how this very serious subject is treated by the filmmakers. I love South Park and the film based on that series, but Stone and Parker are way out of their league here, in fact it seems that they are the assholes and I won't spell it out but I'll leave it to the reader to figure out what we are and what is being done to us.",Team America - World Police
205,shadowycat,A Wicked Sendup,7,17 October 2004,"We ran to the theater for opening night of Team America: World Police tonight. Last night we stayed home with Eurotrip from Netflix. I have to admit that although the two funniest parts of Eurotrip had me laughing much, much harder than any single moment of Team America, hands down I'm glad we caught Team America at the theater and netflixxed the other. This is a film that needs the big screen. At least for a first view.This is not a spoiler, everyone knows there's a puppet sex scene in Team America, and it was the funniest scene. There is also an advanced degree of southparkian (or is that really Trey Parkerian?) scatological humour, foul language, and dead fowl. Most of the charm of this film is its visual humour. The fun is in the lush interpretation of real-life imagery through the lens of single- frame animation. The more clever and low-tech the animators' solutions, the more fun the film became. And overall, this is a wicked sendup of action movies - genre afficienados will not be disappointed.The film tells the story of how mild mannered Broadway actor Gary Johnston is recruited into Team America in order to save the world. I can't get over how much he began to look like George Michael, and then morphed into some sort of buff Kurt Russell type. He goes through a lot of changes. The range of emotion the puppets evoke is genius.The marionettes are great, the sets are fantastic, and although many things are going to offend many people, it's a fun film, the theater was packed - it was a raucous opening night crowd - and fun was had by all. But, the animated opening sequence of Eurotrip set my brain on edge to expect ha- has, while the opening of this film was ultimately the opening of an action pic, so I'm wondering if I would have laughed harder at the funny bits if my brain had been prompted to expect comedy in that critical first minute where the subconscious decides whether a film is going to suck or not. Film students and big producers reading this: take note and beware.",Team America - World Police
206,he_who_leads,One of the Most Quotable Movies I've Ever Seen,8,9 January 2008,"The later 'South Park' episodes have shown a trend. The creators - Stone and Parker - have seen their creative juices dry a little so they've been relying more on two things. Massacres and Parodies. 'Team America' has both. More on this later.Broadway Actor Gary Johnson is recruited by Team America: World Police. His acting ability is needed to foil a grand terrorist plot. The thing I kept hearing from everyone is that the first 1/2 hour is brilliant but then descends into the usual Parker/Stone gross out gags. Well I watched the first 30 minutes and was still laughing hard for the next 30 minutes. This movie is a parody but with enough creative originality and things to say to move it beyond being JUST a silly parody (ie Scary Movie 3). Where the movie slides is the final act, where the parody moves into an area that has just been done to death (even as a paradoy). The team needs to foil the terrorists as the clock is ticking down. Cue more massacres stuff.This creators have hit movie gold for a number of reasons - the puppets are cool and the sets look fantastic. All the more so when you hear that everything was done old-school - no computer trickery here. From Paris to Cairo a lot of love and effort went into this film. The single-mindedness and naivety of America is hilariously captured here without being mean-spirited. The characters just are who they are. They're even likable and engaging! The comic genius just keeps on coming with the dialogue, plot developments and catchy as hell songs. Some of these things (ie the puppet sex) will go down in comedy history. I mean, the vomit scene is like the gross-out golden moment on par with 'I coulda been a contender'). The comedic targets are wisely picked: American chest-beating right-wing neo-conservatism and righteous liberal head-banging/shaking.The world has been crying out for a movie like this. While there have been movies and docos on America's 'War on Terror' fuelled with anger and despair (Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon, Clooney and others get a look-in here) none have captured the absurdity of the whole situation so easily. If 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' was all about pushing the limits of decency, then 'Team America' is definitely more mellow but still cuts to the bone and even surpasses that film. This film demands repeat viewings.",Team America - World Police
207,MacBalthus,They kick ass again!,8,2 December 2006,"What does it need to bullshit the most powerful nation of the world, along with its government, a few of the most outstanding characters and even a war sometimes called ""Vietnam, the sequel""?First of all a complete lack of any respect, then a strong opinion about everything one talks about and, for the seasoning, balls, big enough to put all this into a movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone proved this qualities many times before and here, they do it once again. It's an almost genius act to write and shoot a story, that basically just makes fun of ""The war against terror"", with characters, that just make fun of ""the action here"" and moments of the lowest comedian level, and the product is such an amusing piece of movie art. ""South Park"" has a simple recipe, that works here too: Most of the time is just absurd entertainment with very rude language, harsh humor and, like mentioned before, a complete lack of respect. The end has a moral. Often a surprisingly true and practical moral. This, combined with the ultimately offensive humor, ends up as a wonderful punch in the face of many, many people. This mixture engines here. Even the act of using puppets as actors has a message, the dialog is sharp and full of jokes and some of the action is impressively made. It also includes the first puppet sex scene I ever saw, which seems to be a problem for some people... I laughed my ass off, especially at their acrobatic skills. Inspired me, really. A true rascal and infant terrible of a movie! And by the way, to all those people who gave bad votes because they call it propaganda: I guess, all of you call ""The great dictator"" by Chaplin a disgusting piece of fascism, huh?",Team America - World Police
208,camachoborracho,Utter garbage,1,24 October 2004,"SPOILER ALERTI got suckered into the hype and ""good"" reviews of this film and so thought this would be a hilarious intelligent skewering of the war and figures and action films all wrapped into one but no, unlike South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, this was unintelligent, uninspired, and worst of all, unfunny. I really wish I could get my 90 minutes back - or at least the $8.50 I wastedI understand this is supposed to be a send up of the above mentioned genre films, but by the end it seems to resort to the same tactics they do to move the story along. It also seems really partisan (right-wing side) although it is ""neutral"" since it is only the left-wing who gets made fun of - I know you could argue the whole film is a mockery of the pro-war/America sentiment but it never specifically targets them. There were some good bits, especially the songs about Pearl Harbor sucking, I'm so Ronery and the Montage song, with the sex scene and occasional line but were these enough to carry the film? Don't think so. A lot of the joked were constantly ribbing you as if to say, get it? get it?! get it?!!?! it's funny!!! but sadly it wasn't (I'm talking about the puke joke and the F.A.G. joke which gets beaten to death and then some when Alec Baldwin talks). That and the general sense of jokes were really lowbrow which is fine, but they were mainly aimed at 12 year old boys, which may explain why my little brother loves it but I and my girlfriend hated it. I would not recommend this film to anyone unless I hated them, I wouldn't even recommend you see it on TV since it is so poor. I guess I am mostly disappointed with the way that so much could have been done with the material that was not. For shame Parker and Stone.FINAL VERDICT: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE0/10 stars",Team America - World Police
209,Bantam,Not for the faint-hearted,8,7 February 2005,"Kim Jong Il: Now you see, the new world is inevitable. Sarah: It's what? Kim Jong Il: Inebita- inevitable. Sarah: One more time? Kim Jong Il: inevitable! Things are inevitably going to change! God dammit, open your fu***n' ears...I love this quote!Let's make this simple: I do not want to start about the political situation or the implications of such actions, because this is an issue of belief. The movie itself is outrageous, it's really 'baaad'. Parker and Stone deliver what they are expected to deliver: fecal humor, tasteless jokes, foul language and best of all the disregard for simply everything. Brilliant!I would not have expected the movie to be that good, since the preview I saw looked like some weird Thunderbirds remake. But just check out the opening scene, where all of Paris gets blown to pieces and all TA can think of, is that they got their job done. Back in the days of BASEketball, which I really did enjoy, probably no one would have thought about those two being that large one day; I thought them just some one-hit wonder, that's for sure. (That is if you can actually speak of BASEketball and the first season of South Park as a hit.)But here they are, showing disrespect for all and everything, for a second time on the silver screen. I have seen some interviews with them where they actually seemed sincere about the way they ridicule the whole terrorist situation, but I couldn't help myself looking at two pranksters laughing their butts off while giving the interview. I personally think they do not give anything about the situation, they just make fun of everything. Which is a good thing to see, as most people take everything too serious, as the controversial discussion about the movie shows.Parker and Stone openly criticize the way of American warfare ('... let's go police the world...') on the one hand, but they also give those who 'act' as if they are upset about it ('F.A.G.') their spanking. Alec Baldwin and Matt Daemon do get their share of fun. Matt was probably furious about being portrayed as a mindless moron, then again, if he deems this shoe fit, he needs to lighten up. Michael Moore, a renowned movie maker himself and acclaimed opposer of the Bush government stars as a 'fat bastard', who switches from a mustard leaking hot-dog to a detonator and blows up the TA-fortress - and himself. I wonder if Mr. Moore could laugh about that? Probably not, even though he claimed otherwise, from what I hear. All of the characters are larger than life, both heroes and villains, but that's just perfect, as this is a way to show what all is really about: power. Take that Blix parody, who says: ""...but the UN must be firm with you. [...] Or else we will be very, very angry with you and we will write you a letter, telling you how angry we are."" I almost did wet myself! One scene where I was thinking: 'Gee, they are gonna do this for a while longer...' and I was right. So Gary comes out of the bar and pukes his guts out, well, that scene goes on for almost a minute and then he is heads first in a puddle, well more in a sea of his own vomit. Simply disgusting, but I know it would come and I liked it! If you take the movie seriously, and some do, I can just pity you. Unfortunately, there are quite a few people who think exactly as the characters in that movie, that is what makes the world a worse place than it could be, if everyone would take it with a stiff pint of humor. I do not know if the movie made a small fortune, or if it gave some people the needed push to think for a minute, but I certainly hope that some found it enjoyable, at least. For it's got good humor, satire and some severely scathing look at the world as it is. Let's hope Parker and Stone continue with their good work and amuse those, who still live on the lighter side of life with their outrageous humor.",Team America - World Police
210,axeman-9,I laughed my ass off.,9,17 January 2005,"If you're the kind of person who calls swearing 'curse words' then this movie is something you should avoid at all costs. All normal, non-fundamentalists however, will probably end up crying with laughter.The film, as you are no doubt now aware, is Trey Parkers satire on the heavy-handed foreign policy of the United States and it's current global effect. The US is portrayed as the centre of the universe, Americans are keen but trigger-happy police and the middle eastern people among us are terrorists toting weapons of mass destruction On several occasions they charge in with there high-tech, red white and blue vehicles and blow the bejeezus out of several historic locations as they try to blast the terrorists off the face of the planet. Locals are left stunned and bruised amongst the rubble of their once beautiful cities as the Team cheerful mount up and head back for America, knowing they've saved the locals yet again, completely ignorant of the devastation they've just visited upon them.I am a fan of Thunderbirds, a fan of South Park and a lover of bad movies and pastiches of bad movies, so this was right up my particular alley. The puppetry was pure Thunderbirds, and on several occasions the limitations of the marionettes are used as material for laughs rather than trying to disguise it. The entire sex scene had the audience in fits, with no attempt made to disguise the joints and obvious construction of the 'actors'. There's so much in this movie I cant begin to sum it up, I can only recommend that you go see it yourself if you haven't already.

As the movie was released near the last presidential elections, many made that mistake. But Trey Parker and Matt Stone are not politicians. They are, first and foremost entertainers. And this is a parody of action movies, nothing more.But what about the treating of liberal actors? Well, in most action movies liberals, who try to help, only make things worse or stop the justice from being done. If the movies this is making fun of are kind of fascist, it doesn't mean this is. And for choosing real life actors to be killed off? Well, that's an old Parker and Stone trick. They know it's just funnier when you get to see familiar faces killed off. It worked on South park, didn't it? In fact, they are friends with George Clooney and Matt Damon. And they still didn't go any easier with them. As for the foreign policy of Mr. Bush, it's just a set-up for all the action, not a political statement. They don't bring out Bush himself, because they used that joke dry already in the short-lived sitcom That's my Bush! So just sit back and enjoy this gross-put comedy without prejudice.

Like President Bush, it cashes in on hate and fear after 9/11.Regardless of what Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone want you to believe, Iraq had nothing to do with the terror attacks. The peace activists said that. Also, Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. For some reason, it is not seen as racist that America can have weapons of mass destruction, but North Korea can't. Some people have the blood of 1,900 American soldiers on their hands. Not Sean Penn.I wonder why Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker show all the blacks in the movie as fools and traitors. They would have had Team America shooting Martin Luther King Jr., if they had any guts. We tend to honour dead saints, and slam living ones. Also, they attack gay people.Much of the armed forces serving in Iraq consits of blacks and gays. The armed forces is where you will never find Mr. Stone or Mr. Parker. They're cynical enough to appeal to patriotism. Too smart (like Bush)to believe a word of it. They probably avoid (legally) paying any more taxes than they should. Taxes help veterans. Most of these pro-war people couldn't care less about them.Join the armed forces, of any land, you have a chance to be killed, end up in a wheelchair, or shuffle around the homeless shelters.

216,Into_The_West,"Not quite Parker's ""A King in New York""",7,28 June 2005,"I love Trey Parker's films. ""Cannibal! The Musical"" is more than just the work of a talented 23 year old, it's a masterpiece. And ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" strikes nary a false note. I had been wanting, therefore, to see ""Team America"" for some time, although I had heard that people construed it as ""pro-war"" and against the war protesters in Hollywood. I finally decided I had to see it, and I was generally glad that I did.""Team"" takes the ""South Park"" movie one step further. The fairly obvious satire of the latter movie gives way to a far subtler version here. There are little subtle references, such as everyone being puppets on strings (and therefore, everyone is manipulated by someone), or when the team's central computer, I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., goes down, a team member cries ""We've lost intelligence! Do you hear me? We have no intelligence!"" We do have the attacks on the Hollywood stars, but no, this is not quite a Republican vilification. When Sean Penn talks about how wonderful Iraq was before the war, including ""rivers of chocolate,"" it's not hard to understand Parker and Stone aren't implying Penn really believes this , or that we should be in Iraq. At worst, they may be questioning whether Michael Moore's implication in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" that Iraq was a nice place before we invaded was a little exaggerated. Being a person who thought ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was an admirable work, I don't have a problem with this. ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" made fun of the left and the right, too.The only real negative comment on Hollywood actors is that they are so removed from what they are protesting against, it may just be the 21st century version of ""Radical Chic,"" rather than heartfelt activism, but again, that's simply the satirist finding targets.And Bush and Co. are not exactly exempt from attack, either. In combating terrorism, Team America proceeds to destroy every international city, including all landmarks, in the process of bringing down the terrorists hiding there. Hardly seems a ringing endorsement of Iraq. Patriotic country songs are ridiculed. Climactic passionate patriotic speeches make analogies to bodily functions you will never likely hear at the Republican Convention.What's more, the whole essence of Team America being a take-off on the puppet TV show, ""Thunderbirds,"" is really that the anti-terrorism perspective is childishly naive. ""The flag waving American is almost a thing of the past!"" is one line in the film, and the irony of this is inescapable. Even a reference to the bar scene in ""Star Wars"" implies anti-terrorists are playing Luke Skywalker; this is later reinforced by having one of the team members dressed as the older Obi-Wan Kenobi.Regardless of all this, the film is not as successful overall as Parker's other efforts. A gag about the fact marionettes can't move like real people (although in this movie, they can when they want to!) wears thin quickly. The presentation of various action movie scene clichés (the member who quits because of guilt, the member with painful memories, etc.) may make sense, but they are rarely in and of themselves funny, and there are long stretches were there are no laughs.When laughs do occur, however, they are screamers. Parker indeed knows how to milk a sight gag beyond belief. These moments make watching the film worthwhile, as are Parker's songs where a ballad becomes a condemnation of director Michael Bay, or a dictator sings a song about loneliness that sounds like something from Sesame Street.When I first heard about ""Team America,"" I wondered if it would be Parker's ""King in New York,"" i.e., the downward spiral of creativity from an absolute master unfortunately at the end of inspiration. Team America, however, is not an analogue to Chaplin's penultimate film. Closer to ""Monsieur Verdoux"" or ""Limelight"": flawed, but the genius still is there just enough to shine through.7 out of 10 stars.",Team America - World Police

Many of the vignettes will be easily-recognisable borrowings from many sources. Of course the action movie clichés are there by the bucket-load, but you'll also see Monty Python too.

I suspect that when they release the unexpurgated version on DVD (putting back in the ""golden shower"" sequence, for example) the movie will movie firmly into the realm of over-the-top, instead of merely a movie that tries to shock us with stupidly foul language.

The satire was weak, the impressions and puppets had nothing to do with the people at all, i mean i hoped there would be some impressions, and the gore just felt unnecessary. The sex scene wasn't funny, the vomiting was just too much, and the constant sex references had no subtlety at all, and that, for me, just ruins everything. My advice, even if you think you'll like this, be warned, it's no South Park, or Cannibal!",Team America - World Police
221,harsawa,Team America is a hysterical movie from the creators of South Park,8,14 July 2005,"Team America is as every bit as offensive and funny as south park. Team America started as a screen test where Matt and Trey tested a puppet trying to grab and drink a glass of water, they thought the results were so funny, they decided to have their next movie star puppets. Team America's styling is similar to south park in some ways, it's offensive, it's crude, it's disgusting, and it's absolutely hysterical. Though I have only seen the uncut version, and I can say that there is no need for that sex scene. This movie would have gotten a 10 from me if it weren't for the sex scene, it's funny at first, then it just gets sickening. That scene is worth skipping. Team America's characters are strong as well, and they never stray away from their personality's or how they do things. One of the funniest things is that they over do all their missions, in the beginning, they don't do a quiet job. They blow up the Eiffel tower, the Louvre, and later they even send a car bombing straight into the sphinx, their carelessness is always funny. This is really worth watching.",Team America - World Police
222,ricknorwood,Gentlebeings--did you notice? The film is about bleepin' puppets!,10,24 October 2004,I think it is absolutely great that people are flocking to see this film. Only in America could a film like this be made. I loved it. I laughed out loud. And I think the big final speech made a lot more sense than most big final speeches in serious films. There are a lot of clichés here that (I hope) nobody will dare write into a movie script ever again. But I am totally weirded out by the number of people posting here who seem take the film seriously. And then take obviously satirical comments about the film seriously. I love political discussions. Let a thousand poppies bloom. But where is your sense of humor?Rick Norwood sfsite,Team America - World Police
223,driver_8,Rupert Murdoch and Fox News present...,1,29 October 2004,"Seriously though, I do enjoy practically everything Parker and Stone do. I like South Park and Orgazmo is a classic. However, this was a five minute skit that got stretched into an 80 minute lame gag. OK, they are puppets and they curse, I get it. It seems that the whole comedic principle at work here is that you will just laugh in amazement when you hear puppets curse and get blown away. Yeah,you do, the first time, and even the second time, and maybe the third time. You get the point. The reality is that this film was really not very imaginative. It is ""Revenge of the Nerds"" time for Parker and Stone. They get to spend an hourbashing the liberal elite of Hollywood. You know the ones, the good looking and pseudo-intellectual types that have the nerve to make political stands. Well, Trey Parker does not like their kind, they are too perfect. He does not like to take stands, but he loves to mock those that do. That is fine, but it becomes a little pointless. You know, in this crazy world of ours today, somehow I don't seeliberal Hollywood at the root of all our problems, but they make such an inviting target. And the right wing could truly claim this film as their own, if there was not 500 curse words in it and puppets performing oral sex on one another. So, Iguess Parker and Stone want to slam both sides, in a way, with a story penned by both Rush Limbaugh and Chris Rock. I guess they would tell you they areequal opportunity offenders. Just a couple of class clowns trashing the geeks and the jocks. But, even that class jerk, who always made fun of people in class, eventually, he got old as well.",Team America - World Police
224,TJ1380,Every action movie you've ever seen...only with puppets.,7,31 May 2005,"When I first heard about ""Team America: World Police,"" I thought it was a joke. I thought that no studio in Hollywood would agree to fund and distribute a blockbuster action movie acted out with ""Thunderbirds"" - like marionettes Now that I have seen the movie, I'm still surprised that a major Hollywood studio agreed to fund and release it, and I still think it's all a joke.I also happen to think it's a very funny joke, and I'm very glad that someone had the guts to release it.The movie is crude, offensive, over-the-top, un-PC, insensitive towards other cultures, and filled with some of the dumbest clichés in the history of Hollywood. In other words, it's exactly like a typical big-budget Hollywood blockbuster released during the summer. Movies like this tend to be unintentionally hilarious and fun to watch in a ""it's-so-bad-it's-good"" kind of way, yet difficult to watch because one gets the idea that these movies were made by people who think that American audiences really think like this, which is something I find more than a little insulting. ""Team America"" is similar to these movies, but it knows how crappy and clichéd it is, and it always seems to be striving to be even crappier and even more clichéd, and for that reason it becomes one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It covers all the bases when it comes to Hollywood clichés: it features gratuitously violent action scenes filled with explosions, cheesy melodrama, an unconvincing romance (complete with puppet sex!!!!), tension between the hero and his quick-tempered, foul-mouthed teammate, an overbearing sense of patriotism (""AMERICA! F*** YEAH!!!""), and a cartoonish, stereotypical portrayal of those that appear as America's ""enemies"" (All Middle-Easterners are terrorists who hate freedom and want to destroy it. End of story). As I sat and watched this movie I could easily think back to at least ten different movies that were exactly like it, only those movies played things completely straight and managed to be much stupider and more offensive to my tastes. They also didn't have puppets.Of course, since this movie was made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, it wouldn't be complete without some kind of social commentary. The entire movie makes fun of the idea that America has, under the current administration, taken it upon itself to essentially police the entire world. It may be ludicrous to think that the heroes are actually saving the entire world every time they travel to a far-off country and destroy everything in sight to take out another terrorist group, but there are people in this country who truly believe that it is our job to police the world and act as its saviors. That is a pretty extreme and arrogant way to look at our country's place in the world, and I hope that some of the people who thought like this saw this movie and had a good laugh at themselves (but I'm thinking that they really all got upset at the treasonous liberals who made the movie). The movie also takes equally careful aim at the far left. Some of the funniest stuff in the film has to do with the anti-war, left-wing celebrities that make up the Film Actor's Guild (think about that title for a second), as they end up looking just as foolish as the trigger-happy Team America. As far as Parker and Stone are concerned, people who take things to either extreme are deserving of ridicule.Overall, although I definitely don't think this movie is for everyone, I found it to be very entertaining. Thank you Matt and Trey. Because of your movie, I'll never see a Jerry Bruckheimer movie the same way again.",Team America - World Police
225,dublin9,Pinocchio keeping the world safe,9,18 October 2004,"My wife and myself live in a typically upscale ""progressive"" NY section. That's why we were only two of twenty five people in our local theater when Team America had its first weekend opening.We were the small, libertarian minority of the neighborhood. And we couldn't stop laughing.Team America is outrageously funny and one of the most politically inciteful movies of our generation. It panders not one bit to either the hard right or progressive left, exposing the nature of their pathology and virtue.In point of fact, Team America shouldn't really be analyzed to death because you lose the humor. If you think the Southpark series is ""anti-progressive"" or ""an instrument of Satan""... well maybe Team America isn't for you.But definitely go see this movie if you can laugh at the puppetry of life.

Its striking, original artistic look, its flawless script, the inspiring finale; everything comes together to make the audience laugh and think and shout for Team America - F*&ck Ya! I was ready to see it again as I walked out of the theater. My teenage years are far behind me.I rarely go out to theaters to see a film but I will probably be in line again on opening night for this one. Concerned about the political leanings? Don't be. No one gets off the hook in this film - right or left. We ALL get to laugh at each other and of course our beloved action films.

227,lamps,Four letter word - Begins with a C and ends P.,4,2 March 2005,"I'm middle aged but still enjoy a laugh. I dare say I don't laugh at the same stuff I did when I was nineteen but I'm always prepared to give it a try.It started off very well in Paris. Too well. Unfortunately this was THE laugh of the film. Enacted in the first ten minutes and later tiresomely repeated in other global locations.I tell a lie. There was another good laugh when the distraught hero had a few soda's too many and wobbled out of the bar in magnificent puppet style. Unfortunately the following vomiting sequence was so crudely overplayed, the really funny bit was almost lost.The UK newspapers gave this movie a reasonable rating as did the TV people. Thunderbirds are monumental and above all esteem. We all accept that, so the prospect of them being incorporated in a feature length satirical movie sounded like a clever idea worth seeing.Unfortunately the writers having this clever idea fell very short of the talent to deliver it's potential. From what I can gather they are responsible for some cartoon show or other which is regarded highly in America and shown on a terrestrial British TV at a late hour when the beer bellies return home from the pub with a Tartrazine take away and a brain suitably conditioned.This was one of those movies where you you walk out of the cinema hoping no one has seen you and cringing not to be classified as one of the cretinous whoopers this movie was clearly targeted at. I was genuinely embarrassed.How on earth those involved in investing so much money in a movie with an opportunity to make America look inwards should be happy to settle for this crud makes me wonder. I came away with the impression that the satire was directed more against The Thunderbirds than America and they were more than happy to do so.Hopefully, America may evolve a sense of humour one day.btw Who is Alec Baldwin anyway?",Team America - World Police
228,sherbetsaucers,This Movie May Well Be Smarter Than You!,7,6 February 2007,"This is, without a doubt, an action movie. The movie went over budget by $12,000,000. As it's original budget was $20,000,000 that is a massive amount. But when you watch it you can see where every cent went. (Building fantastic sets, blowing up fantastic sets) This movie originally came into being because Matt and Trey thought that while the movie Armageddon was hilarious, it would be even funnier if they did it with puppets. As they couldn't get the rights to do that, they made this instead. (See, I said it was an action movie).Team America are an 'elite' unit committed to fighting 'Terrorists' and generally saving the day. It is important to note that the 'Terrorists' are all the same, no matter what shade of brown their skin happens to be. As they have the biggest guns and best equipment they see it as their responsibility to police the world, whether or not the world actually wants to be policed. All of this is rather cleverly summed up in the title song 'America, F**k Yeah!' Oh, and they're puppets.Yes, they walk in a funny way, yes you can see the strings and yes there is puppet sex. However, if you think this movie is just funny because of the swear words and the puppet jokes you are missing a lot of fun.This is a movie that manages to satirise both the polarised right and left wing views of the 'war on terror'. Ironically it was the jabs at the left wing that seemed to garner it with its worst reviews. Apparently laughing at some of the frankly naive views of many on the left is childish, but making fun of the right wings ' Guts-'N'-Glory' approach is fine. So once again Matt and Trey have managed to upset both sides of the argument. Well done them.It also pastiches the action genre wonderfully. The obvious gag of over the top explosions and gory deaths is clear, but having lead characters pausing and having quick discussions about their deepest feeling in the middle of combat like we have seen so many times, but showing just how fantastically ridiculous this conceit is is a truly inspired piece of writing.However the most subtle level this movie works on, and one that many people don't seem to notice, is attacking the insular views held by many people in America (and the western world in general). Obviously the fact that locations are given with reference to their relative distance from America, and the fact that these 'foreign' locations have very little to do with their real life counterparts (the Eiffel Tower, Arch De Triumph and the Louvre are all in he same plaza, while in Egypt if you drive out of Cairo you quickly pass the Pyramids of Giza then Abu Simbel and finally the Sphinx) are not exactly subtle. Nor is the fact that Gary's disguise as a middle eastern terrorist is at best mildly insulting (he actually wears a towel on his head).What is subtle is the use of a term I just threw in the last paragraph. 'Middle Eastern'. When told he will have to disguise himself Gary protests: 'But I don't even look middle eastern.' The middle east is made up of countries from south west Asia and north-east Africa. It comprises countries as diverse as Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Turkey. How can a person look 'Middle Eastern'? Of course they can't. It is a name invented by western Europe a good few years ago used to describe a diverse group of countries.It is this kind of level of subtlety which reminds us of our own blinkered view of the world, as long as we look out for it. Many people are put off by Matt and Trey, both by their crassness and how juvenile their humour can be. However just because something is juvenile dose not preclude it from being insightful as well.Matt and Treys view seems to finally be summed up at the end by Gary's' 'Dicks, p*****s and a**holes' speech. Now, a few more years into the Iraq conflict, I think we could all agree on a slight, final addition to his speech. If a dick isn't careful when it f**ks an a**hole, it will get covered in s**t.Puppet sex is very funny though.",Team America - World Police
229,conmech,Thank You For Making This Film,9,15 June 2019,"I was wondering why this movie never had a sequel because it looks like a no-brainer. Unfortunately I realized the makers of the movie hated making it because the puppets were hard to work with, the movie didn't make bring too much money, and there was a lot of critical backlash, even the liberal actors hated it.
I feel like the movie was made just for me. First of all, I never laughed at a movie this hard for years. Everything is great about this movie. How they worked on the animatronics, the references, easter eggs, THE SONGS. Trey Parker is just a natural talent. Plus, I appreciate it as a person living in the middle east, because it's still the best movie which pokes fun at USA claiming to bring peace to the middle east while invading it for its own benefit, and actually bringing more misery.

230,richlandwoman,The Comedy is Stretched Pretty Thin,7,27 October 2004,"A few moments were very funny, several were kind of cute, and many were just boring.I felt that almost all the good parts were nonpolitical -- the traumatic ""Cats"" story, extreme vomiting, the discussion of relationship-problems during a dogfight, Gary's character in general.However, a big part of this film involves nothing more than heavy-handed criticism of know-it-all Hollywood liberals, and there simply AREN'T many jokes here. ""Alec Baldwin -- F.A.G."" is kind of funny once, but it gets repeated with little variation over and over.In fact, most of the time the many left-wing actors aren't even the target of jokes -- just bullets and other forms of violent death.This didn't offend me, but it didn't interest me either. Whenever the naive-yet-vicious-liberal-actor part of the plot took over, I started thinking, ""Well, Alec is kind of pompous, but he starred in 'Glengarry Glen Ross,' and that's much better than this movie. And Sean's made at least half-a-dozen films that I'd rather be watching right now....""In all, Team America has about as many laughs as a good South Park episode.

This movie was very clever & funny. Even with the cuss words, which worked, & the sex scene, I would recommend this to any adult looking for a good laugh & a good time.Many people have claimed this is an attack against George Bush. I think it was a criticism against all of Washington. It criticized all of Washington's idea that America is the ""World Police"" Washington has had this attitude since Roosevelt.

NOT recommended for kids under 18 though. I guess I am one of the RED state kind of guys and am often offended by the liberal slant that a lot of humor has, but I was delighted by the fact that this movie poked horrific fun at virtually all points on the political, social, and cultural spectrum. I was rolling on the floor as Team America laid waste to Paris to stop 2 terrorists from suitcase bombing the city...France, the Terrorists, and (unfortunately) our Team America were all painted in a delightfully inept manner that still tickles my insides weeks later.

234,The_unemployed_cynic,"Riefenstahl, eat your heart out",6,25 October 2004,"Team America: World Police has a lot going for it. The idea of using puppets is in itself ingenious, well chosen and very well executed. Much more fun than the original, both puppet-wise (Thunderbirds) and actor-wise (live action hero movies). Where it horribly fails is in it's morality. In the end, this movie is much like the Fox 'news' department in that it seems to take the views of the neoconservatives as gospel, thereby turning itself into a weapon of mass manipulation. When people in the entertainment industry turn into liberal spokespersons, most harm they can do is bore us to death. On the other hand, when people in that same industry turn into propagandists of a regime that is suspect at best, and may someday be exposed as McCarthy times a thousand, they are playing with fire. Leni Riefenstahl would have struggled to make such a reactionary endorsement for her favorite 'war president' of that era. Satire should be independent and critical of regimes, not endorse the worst forms of conservatism and bigotry they represent.

One one level it mocks the conventions of Hollywood action movies like The Rock and Pearl Harbor.These films are are so over the top, so devoid of any emotional content that they are ripe for satire.There are scenes in Pearl Harbor that are truly awful.Think of Kate Beckninsale's voice over as she writes her love letter to Ben Affleck.On another level,it attacks Hollywood liberals who love to pontificate about issues from global warming to the Middle East.Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Susan Sarandon are just three of the stars who are given the Parker/Stone treatment.This movie reminds me of MAD magazine in its heyday.The film also has a sly dig at the War on Terror.At the very beginning of the film,we see Team America lay waste to Paris in their fight against terrorism. Needless to say, they expect the Parisians to be grateful!!Sound familiar??If you love subversive humour, and are not offended by sex and swearing, then this is for you.By the way, I forgot to mention that all the characters are puppets!There is even a raunchy sex scene that has to be seen to be believed!!",Team America - World Police

The movie is rated R for nasty language and sex, and it is not for children!!!!!Spoiler Alert: To see the liberal actors willing to kill for peace and swearing their allegiance to Kim Jong Il (who's a madman and mass murderer) was not only ironic and sadly oh so true, but was also humorous. The Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.) loves peace so much, they try to kill Team America, while Michael Moore hates America so much, he becomes a suicide bomber and blows up Mt.

Why did they leave out Ben Affleck, Streisand, Springsteen, Bon Jovi?? They have a song about how ""Pearl Harbor: The Movie"" sucks and Ben Affleck is the worst actor ever! It is so true!!!!Other songs, ""I'm So Ronery"" by Kim Jong Il and ""Team America: F--- Yeah!"" which is the theme song.

239,froboz,Brilliant puppet movie,10,27 November 2004,"I love South Park and the straight-faced satire of Matt Parker and Trey Stone. They always have a humanist and old-fashioned naturalist approach to show the weaknesses in the limited and fashionable ideas in modern USA. They do their satire not by exposure, but by explosion: the ideas blow up in your face. Like when Matt Stone himself, interviewed in ""Making Of South Park"", says: ""you know, we expect a lot of our people, but when they show up at the office, we're already there, and when they leave, we're still there, you know what I mean, and they can see how hard we work, and that, I think that inspires them, to work all the harder, for us"". He delivers this line with such a straight face that you are lured into a semiautomatic approval of Calvinist work ethics, even if you know he's just joking. You might at times even feel insecure about where the satire ends: is it a joke about a joke? What does Matt and Trey *actually* think? *Do* they come first to the office every morning? You can't even save yourself by rolling the eyes and saying ""of course not, you fool"".""Team America: World Police"" is a puppet animation which is almost self-evident by it's title. The world police is a small team of vigilante puppets that fight world terrorism. In the opening of the movie you soon see them cheerfully destroy the Eifell tower in a fight against semitic-looking terrorists in Paris... and you get the joke. But when they are critized by Hollywood actors for this act of destruction, the critics are exposed as hypocrites that actually work for the evil terrorism of the world. In fact, we will see the workings of a 'republican conspiracy theory' turn real. Typical Matt and Trey!The movie is a lot of laughs, and makes fun of an endless row of Hollywood clichés and has tons of movie references. The satire is never done plumply.

But Parker and Stone don't seem to have much of a sense of pacing: the movie reaches a climax before the fifteen-minute mark, and once you get a taste of the humor it's just more of the same for the next hour and a half or so. Quickly, the movie falls back on the Austin Powers Principle, the main idea being that if they throw a thousand gags at you and you only find one percent of them funny, you'll still laugh ten times!Aside from the pacing problem and the overall stupidity of the humor, Parker and Stone's apathetic political view gets old in no time. It starts out as amusing, quickly becomes depressing, and it's not long before it gets sickening.Toilet humor can be funny when its unexpected; otherwise it's just plain dumb, unless you're eight years old, though I doubt that this was the target age group for Team America.",Team America - World Police
241,simpletonistic,Team America Finishes Dead Last,2,14 November 2005,"Except for the sex scene featuring a couple of marionettes slamming into each other from a variety of positions, there wasn't much too laugh about during ""Team America: World Police."" Seems the boys, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, fell prey to the idea that an action movie featuring marionettes would--in and of itself--be funny. Unlike their ""South Park"" endeavor, which is VERY funny, ""TA:WP"" lacks the solid writing that abounds in their ""SP"" episodes. Too bad too, because they had all the ingredients, inclusive of their employment of marionettes, to present an absolutely hilarious slant on the war on terrorism, the state of US politics, the lampoon of celebrities, etc. Perhaps, increasingly over-whelmed by the daunting task of carrying out such an ambitious project, Parker & Stone, who have said in interviews that they would never undertake such a project again, simply lost steam and the persistent desire required to re-write continuously for to max out the laughs-per-minute. That's not to say they didn't try. Hell, they tried to agitate as many factions as possible: homosexuals, Hollywood, terrorists, the French, the U. S. Military apparatus, and on and on and on. For the most part though they shot blanks, relying on cheap laughs and their one-trick-pony ideal that viewers would find continuous humor in the actions of marionettes moving clumsily along in action sequences. The latter ideal garnered laughs for the first few minutes or so but thereafter, aside from the sex scene, it failed to sustain laughs or support the lame punchlines. Had the boys used the marionettes more creatively, as they did in the sex scene, perhaps showing us a marionette ""sick bay,"" or a marionette surgery, or, or, or, they could have personified the wooden figures further (physically) and gotten more laughs via whatever absurd and more intimate physical actions the marionettes undertook. To that end: Parker & Stone, via ""South Park,"" are the original bad boys of cable cartoonage, yet, in ""TA:WP"" we didn't even get a glance at a marionette's private parts!!! They failed to push the envelope.All in all I felt that Parker and Stone did less with more and that once immersed in the arduous process of shooting a movie employing marionettes, thereby facing the constraints inherent in their choice of players, they spent more time figuring out logistics, timing and continuity than re-writing their punchless script.",Team America - World Police

Not to mention that marionette porno is funny as all get out. TA:WP parodies patriotic pop-country anthems, Return of the Jedi, Thunderbirds, and more. Plus, the film features the ballad ""Pearl Harbor Sucks, and I Miss You."" The film deftly displays the deranged imaginations of the best team of comedic minds to ever bless the animated film industry. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are totally brilliant.

Politically, no group is left unsatirized: from the idiotic faux-country patriotic music, to know-it-all leftie actors being portrayed as goon puppets (the more self-important members of the Tim Robbins and Sean Penn fan clubs may want to skip this), no group escapes without being ridiculed.Of course, what one would expect besides savage social commentary is gross-out humor, and that is present in droves. This has the best puppet vomiting scene since ""Meet The Feebles."" In addition, there is: puppet ""marital relations,"" puppets being blown up, puppets being fed to cats, puppets being fed to sharks... All the puppets are done in the style of ""Thunderbirds"" (the old TV show, not the dismal failure of a live-action movie). And the songs are hilarious too! ""'Pearl Harbor' sucks and I miss you"" is one of the funniest songs you will ever hear.",Team America - World Police

No holds barred in this flick they attack people around the world and in our own country, destroying everything its path. Insane action sequences lead to the downfall of huge cities as Team America tries to save the world from terrorist scum, which you just can't do anymore with put pissing everyone off. Only downside is they do not make fun of either presidential candidate but if they did they would probably get sued and in a few months the jokes may not be too funny so maybe its for the better.

246,PseudoFritz,Better as movie satire than as political satire,7,19 October 2004,"Unfortunately I can't call ""Team America: World Police"" the best adults-only puppet movie I've ever seen, because I've seen Peter Jackson's magnificent and vile ""Meet the Feebles"" (and if you're even reading this page, so should you). But it's still pretty damn funny.Yes, some of the laughs come just because it's puppets (for instance, the puppet kung fu), but I was laughing nonetheless. The movie at its best, though, wasn't any particular moment, rather the merciless dagger into the heart of the Bruckheimer explosion-fest blockbuster CRAP genre. If you want to see property damage, ""romantic"" sex, carnage, and over-earnestness that's INTENTIONALLY funny rather than unintentionally ridiculous, this is your movie. It's too bad the songs weren't nearly as good as in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut"", but then again, since they were mostly spoofs of lame movie songs (such as ""Freedom Costs a Buck-o-Five"") they wouldn't be accurate if they weren't somewhat lame themselves.However, even though I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, it is NOT even-handed in its satire. Gary's final speech, while very funny, also seems to be a fairly sincere argument in favor of U.S. global intervention, and that's a position that I, along with the actor/activists portrayed, find arrogant and dangerous (run a web search on ""the Wolfowitz doctrine"" and see if you like what you find).On the whole, though, if you THINK you'll like the movie, you probably will.7/10",Team America - World Police

And yes, that's a huge part of it. But another huge part is the fact that, if you can't laugh at yourself as well as those you disagree with, you will not like this movie. It takes even shots at both sides so if you take yourself or your personal politics too seriously you will probably hate it. If you can't laugh at the humor that pushes R to the limit, you'll probably hate it. If you can't see that there really is a profound and true message beyond all that humor, you'll probably hate it.

Some of the humor I enjoyed, but for the most part it just seemed like a 10 year old trying to act edgy around his friends. I enjoy a good offensive joke, but this really didn't have any; it was just bland and uninteresting. I honestly had almost forgotten about this movie until someone mentioned it, and the memory of wasting over an hour of my life came back to inspire me to write this review to tell people not to waste their time like I did.",Team America - World Police

The humor generally ranged from low brow to lower brow, but the overall themes were funny despite the fart joke humor and something subtle and witty shines through. This might as well be the hallmarks of Trey and Matt since South Park is cut from the same cloth.A perfect example is the theme song for the team when they blast off Thunderbird's style: ""America, F*** YEAH!"" You don't get much more low brow than a song that's got ""F*** YEAH"" as the repetitive chorus, but the humor is deeper. It casts a mirror on the American ego that is on display throughout the movie. It's also catchy and the whole theater was singing along.The puppet aspect is also lampooned, from the opening shot of meta-puppetry to several ""yeah, they're just puppets"" moments. Some of these were weak, others were spot-on funny (watch for the ""panthers"" to attack the trapped heroes).SO... if you like South Park and loved the first SP movie, than you've probably already watched this movie. If you're looking for a brutally funny low-brow pic, go see it. If neither of these sounds like fun then this movie will be torture. I was still laughing he next day.",Team America - World Police

It's humor appeals to the most juvenile of instincts (much like the true war that Bush has waged). I watched the first 30 minutes and may have laughed once or twice. This movie in my opinion is the most over-rated I have ever watched. For the life of me, I can't see why it has received such good reviews. Any knuckle head could have written such a poor story.

The best thing the guys from south park have ever done. Really its that good. I am sure you will laugh at this movie. The Kim John Ill scenes with Hans Brix make me laugh so hard.

252,TomiusJ,A lesson in how write good comedy. Team America: World Police is a classic!,10,5 October 2005,"Although I'm a fan of South Park and the writing talents of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, it still took me just under a year to see this film after it was released. I saw it today, and I was not disappointed. In fact, it's probably one of the funniest films I've ever seen.The plot revolves around an anti-terrorist squad named ""Team America"". These ""world-police"" are sent all over the globe to stop terrorists from getting up to any nasty stuff. The film opens with the Team in France, taking care of some third-world baddies. After a nice demonstration of mass firepower, they exit, the day saved. Later, they find out that all the terrorists are planning to form together to end the world once and for all, and only by getting a certain actor named Gary to join them, will Team America be able to save the day! Of course, this sets up the premises for some serious, serious fun!Firstly, I'd like to say how amazed I am that they crafted such an imaginative and excellent film from puppets. Thunderbirds never interested me; I would always switch channels when it came on TV. It used to bore me, mainly because it was, generally, a show with lifeless puppets supported on strings! Team America pulls them off flawlessly, and never did I think, ""Oh, why?"". I actually believe the puppets are the key to the comedy (of course they are)! The writing is top notch. Trey and Matt still haven't lost it. It's funny, smart and very well thought-out, something that's rather strange to see in this sort of film nowadays. Harry-Gregson Williams (most famous for his Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty score) composes a basic, yet enjoyable score that fits this film perfectly! The songs, written by Trey Parker, are hilarious! ""Everybody has AIDs"" and ""Montage"" are two of my favourites.Overall, I recommend ""Team America: World Police"" to anybody who enjoys South Park, or even comedy in general. This foul-mouthed-puppet extravaganza kept me entertained for the entire 90 minutes and is a milestone in film-making, as I heard the shoot was incredibly difficult!

253,SusanAdebisi,Kenny lives......,6,4 December 2005,"Typically scatter shot, hugely hit & miss In the tradition of the great Southpark Parker/Stone revert to their favourite trick - avoid using real people(this time marionettes) and let loose. Mocking and laughing at as many varied things as possible along the way.Starting out by lampooning The U.S' meddling abroad encompassing big budget movies, special ops, a love story and a Weapon of mass deception. To be honest the whole thing disappoints as by the end It's a very silly action movie parody, no where near Hot Shots. Shame because the concept Is a bold and clever one that Intrigues. The presentation Is brilliant and smartly done, the songs devised very funny - ""montage"" & ""love you a bit more"" are as good as ""blame Canada"" or ""what would Brian Boitano do?"". Much has been made of the gratuitous stuff but to quote Brian Connelly - IT'S A PUPPET, albeit very naughty puppets.Team America's token value will always be high as It's like an explicit Thunderbirds and just for originality deserves credit.

254,NotSureifthisis7734,The year's most gut-wrenching comedy and political satire,10,15 October 2004,"Right from the start, this has to be said: do not take your children, your parents, your wife, or your liberal friends to this movie. For one thing, it's hard to laugh when your jaw is on the floor. This could cause injuries. For another, you don't want sensitive PC types getting all huffy and demanding their money back andafterward complaining that your ruined their minds, etc. This is one rough film. I haven't laughed so hard in years, but be warned.Let's face it: we live in uptight times. An awful lot of people take themselves far too seriously and while they don't mind dishing it out, have a bit of a problem taking it. For this kind of attitude, see Ebert's lame review. While TA:WP strives to be an equal opportunity offender, I suspect that the Left will be far more upset watching this then any of the non-Left. They simply are not used to beingridiculed. Right-wingers are, which gives people like me, a rightist libertarian, an enormous advantage in life. Actually, very few conservatives will see this film. Most conservatives are stiffs anyway, who freak at the thought of a man propositioning his own wife, and who think sex is the ghastly thing men do to women, except when making babies -- and don't you dare push it beyond that,mister! You show those types a scene with a couple of marionettes going at it, and they better have nurses and oxygen bottles close by (ala William Castle). So the audience for this film will be limited, which is a shame because it is the best comedy in years and may well be the most trail-blazing film comedy since Blazing Saddles, and by far the most astute political satire. Let me put it this way: if you are a fan of the Penn & Teller series Bullshit! you will probably like this movie. If you are the type who would attempt to watch an episode and find yourself screaming, ""They said a word you can't say on TV!"", better pass.I was thinking after seeing the film that one movie it reminded me of, in terms of sheer visceral impact, was ""The Passion of the Christ."" This film also takes its premise and story and runs with it, letting nothing stand in the way. Both are obscene films, but for a reason: one for violence (fully justified), the other for language (also fully justified). Both are hard ""R"" and earned it. Note: there was only one scene in TA:WP (near the end) that I might considercheap. The rest worked perfectly. In some scenes, remarkably, the movieturned serious and moving despite all its efforts.Anyway, if you don't fall into the above excluded categories (I imagined that if Penn and Teller had been sitting by me in the theater even they would havebeen squirming), see this amazing film.",Team America - World Police

South Park's Trey Parker and Matt Stone show their true genius in this vulgar politically incorrect parody of the American might. Using puppets reminiscent of the old kids show ""Thunderbirds"" worked especially well. They don't even try to hide the puppet strings or aim for realism.

257,cecrle,"Looks great, but lacks humor & intelligence.",4,27 May 2005,"Overall, I was let down by this movie and disappointed with the makers, whom I usually find quite funny. Parker & Stone have shown in other films & shows that they can be funny, intelligent, AND absurd/childish/over-the-top/etc., all at the same time. But Team America is seriously lacking in the humor department, as well as the intelligence department. Why make a movie like Team America unless you're really going to think about the issues involved (terrorism, the role of the U.S. as ""world police"", opposition to the war in Iraq, etc.)? Parker & Stone have shown that they can make fun of BOTH sides of a given issue, but their slant in this film just feels weak, skewed, and not so much lop-sided as just plain LAZY and LAME. Don't get me wrong; visually this movie is amazing and worth seeing just for the ingenious sets built from all sorts of random odds & ends to suit the smaller-than-life-size scale of the movie. In fact it looks so good that you'll look right past most of the amazing details without realizing just HOW good it all looks unless you watch some of the bonus features and pay close attention to background details.But the movie almost goes out of its way to ignore many aspects of the subject matter it addresses. Sure, Team America is seen tearing apart whatever locations they're sent to, and congratulating themselves on a job well done. But that's about the only criticism shown of the ""world police"" and their hypocritical mission to thwart terror & destruction. MUCH more time is spent making fun of those who oppose the war, namely members of the Film Actors Guild, a.k.a. FAG. This lame joke is used many times. It would be fine if it was used once to make fun of a specifically lame actor, but no, this movie does its best to point out that those who are concerned about the immorality & illegality of the war-on-terror are FAGs. MUCH less attention is paid to the absurdity of those waging the war in the first place. No mention at all of President Bush and his posse of chicken-hawks. Nope, to watch Team America, you'd think it was American actors who are the ones behind so many of the world's current problems. Actors may be annoying when they're wrong or stupid, but when armies & governments are wrong and stupid, thousands of human beings are killed & maimed. So given the choice between emphasizing the idiocy of ACTORS vs. GOVERNMENTS, I think the intelligent choice goes without saying! Unfortunately, Parker & Stone don't make many intelligent choices in this movie.The film's two main jokes are the above-mentioned use of FAG, and the arch-villain Kim Jong-Il's pronunciation of words involving the letter 'L'. Like a good little Asian stereotype, Kim Jong-Il REPEATEDLY says things like ""I'm so *rone-ry*"", etc. It's kind of funny at first, but after awhile you start to wonder why Parker & Stone didn't take some more time to come up with quality jokes (they've shown elsewhere how clever they can be, but this movie is quite lacking in that department), or at the very least, a wider VARIETY of easy, lame jokes instead of the same few again & again.I even like their ""stupid"" humor in movies such as _Baseketball_ and _Orgazmo_, but _Team America_'s humor is stupid AND irresponsible. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people have died due to actions taken by the ""world police"" of America, and all Parker & Stone can do is sneer at the whole thing, as if anyone who cares about it one way or another is stupid for even caring. What a hopeless, Generation X mindset. Listen to their little diatribe against actors (""worst people in the world"", I believe they claim) in the bonus features section and you'll realize they have some maturity ""issues"" to work out within themselves. They appear to be stooping quite low to appease the most common, immature denominator (young, dumb American males) who will laugh at ""fag"" jokes and give zero thought to the meaning behind the subject matter.Did they chicken out under pressure from the major studio and back down from any overt political ""friction"" or satire? I don't know. But it takes a lot more guts to speak out against government-sanctioned violence than it does to be so apathetic as to insinuate that anyone who is informed & sympathetic about the issue is nothing more than an annoying ""fag."" Parker & Stone lose some serious points in my book for _Team America_. I think they got too wrapped up in the puppetry & set-building and forgot to give their script as much work as it needed. I know they're intelligent guys, but their IQs seem to have been on a real holiday with this movie. I thought there would be intelligent criticism of all sides of the matter in this movie, a la The Daily Show, but I was wrong. See it for yourself and decide.",Team America - World Police

I could waffle on about the effects, puppets, dialogue... (Matt Damon), but instead I would like to focus on two things...1) Music... I have never laughed as much at a soundtrack as I did with this one. Picture the Top Gun soundtrack and insert Trey Parker's sick sense of humour... America (F*CK YEAH), I Miss You (like Michael Bay missed the mark when he made Pearl Harbour), We've Got AIDS (a must for anyone who is a fan of Rent), I'm Lonely and, my personal fave, You Need A Montage!!! It was clichéd beyond believe, but if you closed your eyes for a moment, you could have easily been watching The Rock or Top Gun!!!2) Storyline... Yes... They attack everyone, but I believe with good reason. If you strip away the obvious spoofs on the Bruckheimer/Simpsonesq movies, I think there was important social commentary. As much as I love Michael Moore (who makes a great cameo), I think that, viewed with a certain level of intellect, Team America is more important that Farenheit 9/11. It shows that too much woolly thinking can be just as dangerous as warmongering. Team America, whilst an overly violent and destructive group, can been seen as a positive force. However, it needs to be tempered with common sense and a thought to consequence. Whilst Hollywood Stars raise valid points when they see war and beg governments to look for alternatives, sometimes there are no alternatives. Look at Hitler and his cronies... What would have happened to the world if we had continually sued for peace? Had Hitler existed now, (some say he does in GW, but that's another matter), would Hollywood all band together to speak out against the war? Just some food for thought.I could be over-intellectualising the movie.

It was a little slow at first but once it got rolling it was extremely funny and I was really glad my wife talked me into seeing it. I am taking a long shot guess here because I have not read any reviews for the movie yet but I have a feeling the movie will not be very popular with democrats that don't have a sense of humor. It pokes fun at republicans too but I have a feeling the Libs took a much harder beating in the flick. I am now watching all the South Park shows because of this movie.

261,BdR76,"A good comedy flick, but very awkward as a political satire.",6,12 December 2004,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone are great comedy writers, but i don't think political satire is their thing. As Dahoyan from Finland also commented here on IMDb, to make a good satire you need to understand the subject. The subject at hand here is ""America is policing the world"". Meaning America abuse their military powers, they use scare-tactics to justify unnecessary military actions, and they think the rest of the world ignore the terrorist threat etc. But the movie doesn't dispute this. Instead, it reinforces it: ""America may be a dick, but the rest of the world are pussies for not standing up to the terrorist assholes""With that said, the movie does have some very funny scenes. For example the sex scene, the guy vomiting outside the bar, ""the montage"", the relational problems etc. Also, the puppets and the way they move add to the overall corniness, which i thought was pretty funny. So fortunately the movie isn't a complete loss.

262,adamblake77,Tasteless puerile arrogance boomed into your ear by megaphone,1,11 June 2005,"The first 15 minutes of this film were actually very funny. But after about an hour I realised that this film is actually a subtle piece of propaganda for the very thing it ostensibly satirises, ie: American Fascism. In a world where nothing at all has any value, or any meaning beyond its most obvious use as a source of puerile humour, then absolutely everything is available to be mocked and disrespected. And it is! If something is offensive, then I think it is OK to be offended by it, and not have to be ashamed or embarrassed about it. This film is offensive, in every way possible, to every group of people possible. Apart from anything else, it is offensive because it is such a lousy movie: massively overlong, appallingly badly scripted. Lazy, complacent, endless use of the most obvious obscenities and sexual and toilet humour. The voice characterisations are grating and one-dimensional. I could go on but why bother? Rarely have I felt so insulted by a film. This is the very worst of modern American entertainment and its effect is deadening, stultifying - infinitely worse than the most tired and clichéd action film in that it believes in nothing but its own cleverness and superiority. In cajoling its viewers to find humour in violent death, torture, homosexual rape, cultural vandalism and genocidal despotism this film is an open invitation to revel in apathy, moral decadence, cultural and spiritual bankruptcy - and in that it could not serve the interests of Emperor Bush and his henchmen better if it tried.

263,reyalvarez,What A Disgusting Movie!,1,11 July 2005,"***Some spoilers in this review!!***The puppet movie ""Team America"" is simply a disgusting movie. There is nothing wrong about its political satire. This movie pokes fun equally at American right-wing jingoists, totally misguided liberals, United Nations bureaucrats, cocky Europeans (especially the French), dictator Kim Jong-il and Islamic fanatics. Some of the satire is quite funny. I especially liked the scene in which Kim Jong-il feeds Hans Blix, the consummate red-tape bureaucrat, to his pet sharks. I also liked the scene in which one of the Team America members cuts Helen Hunt in half during a sword fight. (But why does Trey Parker hate these movie stars so much? Is he insanely jealous of them for not accepting him as one of them?)But that was the extent of this movie's hilarity. Rest of the movie was a disgusting garbage. Most of the humor in this movie was based on some sick sexual jokes or something disgusting. Some voice-over actor had to use the f**k word fifty times a minute. I was especially disgusted when the female puppet defecated during a sexual act. Generally speaking, some sexual jokes may add even some charm to a movie. However, after Trey Parker and his screenwriters kept on throwing sickening sexual and scatological jokes repeatedly and ad nauseum, I was totally disgusted. Moreover, what cheap special effects did Trey and his crew use! Some of the models looked as if they came straight from some 99 cent stores. They really looked like tiny, cheap toys. (A definite no-no in the world of special effects.) I could have filmed better special effects scenes in my bathtub using my 99 cent store U-boat models and 99 cent store airplane models. Was the cheap special effects intended to enhance the cartoonish atmosphere of the movie? It just enhanced my disgust for this movie.And what about all those puppet strings the moviegoers could see? Even though the puppets were superbly crafted, the visible strings made the movie look cheap.I was especially disgusted with this movie because I know for a fact that British movie producer Gerry Anderson did make superb TV series and movies using puppets and special effects more than forty years ago. Gerry Anderson and his then wife Sylvia Anderson made TV series like ""Stingray,"" ""Thunderbirds"" and ""Captain Scarlet Versus Misterons"" using puppets and special effects, same techniques used in Team America. The Andersons did a much, much better job with 1960's technology than Trey Parker and his gang did with 21st century technology. In fact, when I was a young boy, I used to love ""Thunderbirds."" Even though the special effects look dated now, I still think ""Thunderbirds"" is a superb TV series. Even though the TV series was made more than 40 years ago, the special effects of ""Thunderbirds"" were much, much better than those of Team America. Many of the scenes used superbly crafted models--nothing like the picayunish junks used in Team America. Some of the special effects scenes looked like real disasters. Real kudos to the special effects coordinator, Derek Meddings. Moreover, one rarely saw the strings controlling the puppets. Compared to the disgusting sexual and scatological humor of Team America, the scripts of Thunderbirds were almost aseptically clean. Thunderbirds' symphonic theme music and incidental music, which showed obvious influence from symphonic greats like Edward Elgar and William Walton, was superbly written by composer Barry Gray. This music was much, much superior to the ""F**k, yeah!"" grunge, heavy-metal music of Team America. The music-if one can call it a ""music""-- from Team America was merely a sorry parody of the worst of REM and Nirvana.After I saw this disgusting movie ""Team America"" I sorely miss Thunderbirds! I wish Gerry Anderson will shoot Trey Parker for making such a horrible nonsense. Calling, International Rescue! Calling, International Rescue! Help! Please rescue me from this disgusting movie ""Team America!""",Team America - World Police

265,angre1-1,great subtle movie with overt facade,10,13 January 2008,"If you read the negative reviews of the movie, you will see an almost universal panning of the movie due to the way it treats the liberal intellectuals of Hollywood. Right wing propaganda it is often called. Some point out, and are close to the mark, that this film actually skewers both sides equally, but they seemed to hate the movie because it wouldn't pick a side. It is neither anti-liberal, nor pro-conservative. It is like a welfare mom condemning abortion, one foot in one world and judging the other half. And that is it's genius. Oh, I am not going to nominate either Parker or Stone for a Nobel Prize, or a Macarthur grant, but what they did was pick the hardest road of all--the one in the middle. The movie opens with World Police attacking terrorists in France. That would be skewering the right--what business would we have exerting our military influence somewhere in Europe? Their country, their problem. Yet, in real life, we do exactly that. Often at the request of the European nations (France begging us to help Yugoslavia, anyone?) Even when it would be best for us to keep our noses out of their business, we seem to be dragged into every little international squabble. We are viewed, by the world, as the worlds policemen. (How many times have you heard of some little place in the world begging America to please send troops to end the civil strife? I literally remember dozens of times.) On the flip side, when there is something that we should be involved in, we often avoid it like the plague. We have a host of idiots in Hollywood who think that because they get big paychecks that for some reason they are now knowledgeable about world affairs, we should listen to them. The fact that they hate the conservatives taints everything they say. They would have us avoid needed conflicts even at the destruction of our own homes, and if we do act, they act so upset that they threaten to move out of the country. This group, too, is skewered by Stone and Parker. Stone and Parker know that America is really the middle group, not the Limbaughs or the Michael Moores. We are the people at the gas station, worrying about 3.00 gasoline, milk prices going up, sub-prime mortages, and nuclear war with Iran. We don't want our boys to die for stupid causes and we don't want to send them to hopeless wars to bleed and die in places we can't pronounce. But we know our boys will go and do the job they have to do so we can go on worrying about that gas, milk, mortages and war. Sure, some of Parkers and Stones jokes are over-extended, and crass, but humor really is the juxtaposition of incongruities. Homophobic, racist, or sexist, it is what it is, and if you choose to laugh, it is up to you. Personally, I can't watch this movie without falling asleep. But I appreciate it for what it is--the realization that sometimes the middle road is harder to take, and will be judged harshly by both extremes, and thus, only the brave may travel that road. For those that have forgotten, this is the home of the brave...",Team America - World Police

Great social commentary !",Team America - World Police
267,KingMFreak,A little to vulgar and offensive,3,20 August 2005,"This movie is rated R for graphic crude and sexual humor, violent images, and strong language  all involving puppets. And this is no exaggeration. Team America: World Police is a dirty, low, sick, and mostly unfunny movie that spoofs terrorism and the way today's societies work.I'll say right now that I enjoyed the first part of the movie. I found it to be funny (for the most part) and nice. But the last bit of the movie is so disgusting and vulgar, that I tried to figure out what went wrong with Trey Parker and Matt Stone's brain. You might say that it is rather harsh of me to bring a movie's rating down so far when it was the ending that really killed me. I believe a lot of the movie relies on how it ends. I didn't much like War of the Worlds because I thought the ending was annoying, yet I give it a C+ because it still had some good sequences. This train wreck has nothing strikingly memorable, unless you count Kim Jong Il's solo, I'm So Ronery.I did find the whole ""America is infatuated with itself"" theme funny. Team America is an independent organization that fights terrorism. In the movie's opening sequence, they destroy about half of Paris in an attempt to catch four terrorists; in another sequence, they manage to destroy the pyramids and the Sphinx.The main character is Gary, a Broadway actor who stars in the play Lease and seems to have the ability to reduce audiences to tears. Team America's leader, Spottswoode, employs Gary to disguise himself as a terrorist and infiltrate their hideout in Egypt. Though the mission is successful, the destruction they leave behind causes protests (one outside the base, a hollowed out Mt. Rushmore, is lead by Michael Moore), which eventually leads to the capture of Team America's team and the destruction of their base. (When their computer is destroyed, with is called I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E, they yell, ""We have no I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E).The marionettes are interesting to look at, but they eventually grow tiresome, and you start wishing for some South Park animation to butt in. The marionettes do provide some funny looking imitations of such famous actors as Sean Penn (who wrote an angry letter to Parker and Stone after the movie's release), Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, and Helen Hunt, among others. They are all members of the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G), and their soul purposes in the movie is to oppose Team America, and be ridiculed & killed.Of course, I'm not a big fan of Trey Parker or Matt Stone anyway. But I have seen the South Park movie, and found it to be a little vulgar, but still intelligent and fun (B-). I just wasn't ready for the vulgarity of this movie, and so I just have to give it low marks. Ebert pointed out that this movie pretty much insults everything about the war on terrorism; from the terrorists to the way we act. They pretty much target everyone. My question: will they ever put themselves under ridicule in their own movies, like they do so many others?I hope they do. In the meantime, Team America: World Police offended me and so I do not think it deserves more then what I have given it. I just hope Parker and Stone's next movie is smarter then this one; they should look back on their South Park movie and take some pointers.",Team America - World Police
268,Hayfax_Jo,Disappointing,6,19 June 2007,"Y'know, I had had high hopes for this movie; after all, Matt and Trey had been delighting audiences with their sacrilegious iconoclasm for years and years and had truly hit paydirt with the SouthPark franchise, so I was expecting all sorts of sharp and vicious comical treats and, alas, this didn't come close to those expectations. Don't get me wrong; there were a number of asides that brilliantly skewered every kind of wrong--and, come to think of it, right--thinking imaginable, and it would have been an enormously sorry state of affairs if, during the length of the movie, I didn't question their taste, or indeed their sanity, on numerous occasions, but those moments aside, and some top-quality pukery, the movie didn't gel for me; I didn't think it had a strong enough story to back up the gimmickry and, most criminally of all, it simply didn't have enough funny jokes. I will enjoy it more when I next watch it, though, because I will make sure, that time, that I'm baked out of my tree.",Team America - World Police
269,izzy-19,Sorely disappointed,3,21 October 2004,"I was incredibly excited to see this movie. When I heard about the puppet sex in the film, that was a sold ticket right there. Unfortunately, when I saw it, I was incredibly let down. I went in ready to laugh, and while I did find much that was amusing, I laughed out loud only three, maybe four times. The songs are good, but short, the puppet movements and reactions are funny for maybe the first fifteen minutes, and the political/social points they are trying to make just get muddled. The social commentary in a 25 minute episode of South Park is much more clearly realized than it is in this feature-length film.Speaking of which, other reviewers have said that if you like the South Park movie, you'll like this. I disagree. South Park: BL&U is in my top five funniest movies I've seen. The timing and voice work is far better in the South Park movie. Plus, the social/political issues they tackle in it are done in a much funnier way.I really wanted to enjoy this film. Maybe it was the crowd I saw it with. They didn't really seem into it, either. Like I said, it was amusing, so it isn't a total waste of time. I'd say it's a solid rental for most people, but I never need to see it again.",Team America - World Police

I said, lets give it five more minutes. Well, three minutes later we'd had enough.My advice would be, if you are not a fan of South Park or similar shows, then be aware this likely will not appeal to you.Ha! I went to submit the comment above, and they said that it didn't have enough lines of text. So now I have spent more time commenting on the movie that watching it.

This movie will make your head practically explode with laughter. I was in pain from laughing so hard in the theater.The comic timing and the subject matter converge to make a comedic masterpiece. It's mostly crude, sometimes deep, and always right on the money. It plays upon Hollywood stock characters and takes them to ridiculous extremes. The parodies and stereotypes are expertly done, and the puppets won't scare you, honestly. Just see it. If you don't get this, you don't get comedy.",Team America - World Police
272,TheRagingBull94,"Team America: Stupid, Repulsive And Politically Incorrect, But Innovative And Original",8,19 September 2011,"I recall seeing Team America: World Police back in 2006 as part of a 12th Birthday Party being held for a friend of mine at the time. At this same time I was a huge fan of South Park and was curious towards checking out this film as it was made by Matt Stone and Trey Parker. I saw it, and I certainly enjoyed, but I never really thought much of it. I didn't think of the movie again until I went to another birthday party a year or two ago and it was on. I didn't watch it then, but I sat down yesterday afternoon and decided to give it another shot. I can conclude that while it is a pretty dumb film, it is highly innovative and I enjoyed it much more now than when I did when I was 12.The story follows a nationalistic American counter-terrorism organization called Team America that exists for the purpose of stopping terrorist groups from the Middle East threatening the Western world. After the death of one of their members, a reluctant actor named Gary Johnston is hired as his replacement in fighting a new terrorist threat to the world being coordinated by North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il.Even from the first scene, there are two things to conclude. The movie is unbelievably cliché and the jokes are very immature. The clichés (at least I hope so) are deliberately put in to emphasize the humor even though it creates unquestionable predictability in the story. The dialogue has been heard before, and the characters all fit a known stereotype. Take for example the reluctant hero, the jerk who doesn't trust the new guy, the lonely villain who wants to destroy the world etc.The humor however draws a lot of reference to dicks/vaginas as well as poo, sex etc. You know, the kind of stuff a dumb 14 year old would find hilarious. As far as the topic of humor goes though it can be quite witty, notably the famous comparison between the types of people there are (Dicks, Pussies and Assholes). I also enjoyed the fact that the movie decided to capitalize on the stereotype of American stupidity. An example that stands out to me if the subtitles indicating location (North Korea, Asia, X amount of miles West of America) as if to imply that people really are that stupid.The fact that the movie was created with puppets is also really interesting. Obviously it was influenced by Thunderbirds. I just loved how well all of this was done. I always prefer live actors, but it was nice to see a bit of a change. The voice acting is great too. It once again demonstrates the talent of Matt Stone and Trey Parker who handle multiple roles. That's one advantage out of using puppets.One more thing I'd like to comment on specifically is the character of Kim Jong-il. I find it hilarious that they portray him as such a wimpy yet dangerous man. The famous ""I'm so ronery"" song is just great. In my opinion, he's the most interesting character in the movie despite the fact that he's the most stereotypical villain possible.Overall, I like Team America. It is immature and politically incorrect, however it is an innovative and overall entertaining movie. I recommend it, especially if you are a South Park fan.8/10",Team America - World Police
273,lilguyollie,I f***ing rove this movie!!!,9,1 August 2013,"Those of you who have not yet seen this movie, please bear in mind that although these are puppets, the acting in this movie is far better than anything you will ever see in the Twilight movies. Sorry to mention that crap. Also you will understand the summary of this review when you see the movie.Basic storyline: Actor Gary Johnston is recruited to Team America: World Police, a group of specialised anti-terrorism soldiers who are led by an older man named Spottswoode. Their task is to bring down an upcoming terrorist attack and save the day.Essentially meant as a spoof of Jerry Bruckheimer's over the top action movies, this movie actually stands out as a cult classic comedy that doesn't only poke fun at Bruckheimer but also at left wing liberals, actors who belong to the fictional group the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G) and ""the murti-tarented Kim Jong Il"". Again you see the movie, you get the joke, or maybe you've figured it out by now in which case good for you. The voice acting from Trey Parker and Matt Stone is as good a ever and seems serious yet stupid at the same time. Plus the musical numbers are a good laugh. I guess all I can say negatively is that it may be a little too offencive or explicit for some. But that's down to opinion.Fans of South Park will love this movie and those who don't will love it if they are fairly open minded. It's a fairly old movie but hey, great comedies don't really exist anymore. So basicarry, go see the movie. Like now.",Team America - World Police
274,randylanders,Basically Sums Up How the World Really Is,10,17 July 2005,"It's truly ironic that a PUPPET movie could point out to everyone how the U.S. sees itself, how actors really act, how the rest of the world genuinely hates us and why I don't go for Jerry Bruckheimer's movies. The guys at South Park are probably the best social commentators in the US today. No one, not even the Hollywood Elite, is above getting lampooned by them, and the targets of their satire should sit up and take notice that their behavior has been noticed. (Heck, I'm surprised that several members of the Film Actors Guild haven't sued their pants off.)

This movie takes all the politically correct psycho-babble and wacky misinformation that the elitist tele-boobs and entertainment idiots treat as gospel, and puts it all on a spit for roasting. It is drop-dead funny, and I could not stop laughing all the way through. If you are one of these ""one-world"", peace, love, join-arms-and-sing bleeding heart liberals (or is that progressives?) you will not like this movie, and should avoid it at all costs.

276,ww_sketcher,Not as Consistent as the South Park film,6,25 May 2005,"Team America: World Police had a fair amount of big laughs, but it's not nearly as consistently enjoyable or as successfully satirical as ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Un-Cut"".To start Team America works best when it's parodying American action films (espeically Jerry Bruckheimer films (e.g: National Treasure (2004), Bad Boys II (2003), Bad Company (2002).) and simply, the puppets in general which are clearly lovingly crafted and perhaps creepily too life-like. This all goes fairly good with the nice 'clearly-written-bad-to-make-it-funnier' dialog of Team America.This may have been better if it weren't so ponderous at times, as most of the Team America squadron members aren't memorable on their own. Perhaps as they are all too similar as puppets, it's not really clear. And of course, the things that plagues all of Trey's work is the juvenile need to offend, i'm not against gross-out humor, (see The Young Ones (TV Series), or the Monty Python and the Meaning of Life for my praise), but it's a hard art to master and keep fresh and smart. The closest we get in this film is to a hardcore puppet sex scene. While other topics such as Puppet vomit, to puppet gore fall under predictable on Trey Parker's standards. The rest of non-gross out humor in the film seems to fall astray to much repetition as the it's not sharp enough to be repeated several times with laughter coming from the audience (was the Film Actor's Guild funny the first time for anyone?). And on the other point, Trey Parker often try to add some celebrity tomato-throwing at people in their films and shows, but from what we see with Team America, it's hard to catch on what specifically offends the boys with Kim Jong-Il, Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore, and certain others, they just seem to lampoon for the sake of it without giving reasons why what they are doing is funny or why it makes sense.So overall, Team America has it's moments, Trey and Matt know it does, but they seem to try and repeat them hoping they are funnier in repetition (they aren't) and they have their desire to shock us with poop jokes (no surprises, or shocks here), and they have surprisingly good puppetry ideas (hurray!).So overall, we have a fairly average comedy. Let's see how we can show them up the next time boys.",Team America - World Police

There's nothing they won't destroy in the name of freedom! Freedom ain't free, you know! F**k yeah!Gary Johnston is recruited fresh from his Broadway appearance in Lease: The Musical to assist Team America, the elite force standing between us and the countries that hate us. After a successful and over-destructive mission in Cairo, a Central American dam is destroyed, killing thousands. Will Gary confront his demons and lend the US a hand after the rest of the team is captured? He'd better figure out who to pledge his allegiance to soon, 'cause North Korea's Kim Jong Il and his followers are stocking up on WMDs and they know how to use 'em.Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park, Orgazmo) take their blend of 'tude and social commentary back to the big screen and crank it up to 11, making it into the most overamped action/comedy/musicals ever made-starring puppets. Yes, those glassy-eyed actors on screen aren't stoned, over-surgeried A-listers..Trey and Matt emulate the style of Gerry Anderson's THUNDERBIRDS series of the 60's, using wooden and plastic marionettes to take down evil. Let the 'controversy' bell ring: Trey and Matt manage to send up everyone-nobody is spared: Foreign policy, our military industrial complex, blind patriotism, left-wingers, right-wingers, cause-driven celebrities, and every 'bigger is better' action flick of the past 20 years.I did mention this is all played for laughs, right? Stop making your protest sign.  From the deadpan delivery of every eye-rolling line you've heard in action films, the hilariously profane 'moralizing' speeches, the action and mayhem (at least one national landmark is blown to bits in every mission to another country), the fight scenes (often merely jamming and tangling the puppets together), to the complete destruction of most of Hollywood's left-leaning activists, you will either fall out of your chair laughing or be reaching for your coat five minutes in. If you've seen South Park you know what you're in for. The love scene alone will make you either pre-order the DVD or write an angry letter to your congressman. Trey manages to sneak in some more clever songs as well; while not as music-dependent as South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut was, he still manages to sneak in some toe-tappers such as the energizing 'Team America: F**k yeah!' to 'I'm Ronery,' where Kim Jong Il laments life at the top of the villain food chain. A later tune 'Pearl Harbor (the movie) Sucked' surely tugs at the heartstrings.. They even manage to recycle the 'Montage!' song from South Park for, well, the token training montage.

But the movie is good for what it is- a hilarious satire film of American politics and polices. The writing is simply some of the best I've ever seen in a comedy.From the very first scene, all the way to the end of the movie I was laughing the entire time. Not just ha-ha or ""that's funny"" type laughter, I'm talking knee-slapping deep belly laughs!Of course your watching marionettes for nearly two hours, but that's half the fun. The movie really wouldn't work as well in any other form. The tone of the writing goes hand in hand with the ridiculousness of the marionettes.The music is what REALLY shapes the movie though. It can transform these shots of puppets into a serious movie by having dramatic music during appropriate times, and then remind us of the true nature of the film, comedy, by making us laugh and want to sing along to such songs as ""America"".Of course, some people will not like it. A lot of the jokes are sophomoric or ""stupid"" type or funny where if you go into the movie with a serious attitude, you'll just be bored instead of entertained. If you think you might be one of these people, have a drink or two to get you into a silly mood. There's no reason not to laugh the entire length of this film- and never once be bored.Great Writing, Great Music.

True, it is a potty-mouthed frag-fest, which skewers Hollywood liberals, Muslims, France, and a certain North Korean dictator, but it is so much more.Perhaps I am giving the film makers too much credit, but as I see it they also savage the ""War on Terror,"" American machismo, conservatives, and Hollywood in general. Indeed, the film attacks mediocrity and shallowness, allowing almost no element of our popular culture to escape unscathed. (The awful film ""Pearl Harbor"" and its schlockmeister director Michael Bay -- also responsible for the craptastic ""Armageddon"" -- are brutalized in a particularly hilarious song.)

Even in their song ""America, f*ck yeah!"", they showcase every American stereotype, like being gun happy, being ignorant, & more. I'm not against America, but I will admit, this country is imperfect, & this film shows that.This film has some pretty good puppetry. I know that was brief, but I kinda have nothing else to say about the puppetry. Anyway, Trey & Matt aren't the only voice actors in this movie, there's also Maurice Lamarche, Jeremy Shada, & Daran Norris as Spotswood. Spotswood is one of the funniest characters in this film in my opinion, probably because when I hear the voice of Cosmo, Jorgan Von Strangle, & Timmy's Dad talking about someone sucking his dick, it just makes me laugh. I guess I'm a sick bastard.The songs are also hilarious, from ""America, F*ck Yeah!"", to ""Everyone Has AIDS!"", to ""I'm So Ronry"", it's all hilarious.So, in the end, this movie ultimately shows that Trey Parker & Matt Stone couldn't suck at entertainment if they tried, & Team America: World Police gets 10/10",Team America - World Police

I think that's pretty apparent by the way the protagonists are portrayed. Overzealous, patriotically stone-aged, and violent are a few words that sum up the way that Team America handle any problem they encounter in the movie.A lot of people have also complained that this movie is offensive. Well, duh? It's supposed to be. If you went to the theater to see this movie without knowing what to expect, then you have obviously never seen an episode of South Park or know about Parker & Stone's political and social leanings. You've got no one to blame but yourself. Team America is meant to be cheap, immature, puerile, politically incorrect, and sick. That's what makes it so great! This movie is one of the best commentaries on America that I've seen for years, and the reason for that is because the creators were not willing to pull any punches, and it's all the more effective for it- although I have a feeling that they did not directly taunt the Bush administration for fear of reprisal. Can't say I blame them (maybe Parker's girlfriend works undercover for the CIA?).Bottom line: this movie trashes ALL sides, not just one. If you can't see that, well, you're just letting YOUR biases shine through.",Team America - World Police

Nothing but constant profanity and gay oral sex jokes. I don't get why everyone thinks this is such a great movie. The only part I thought was funny was when they started poking fun at the Pear Harbor movie, and that God-awful Ben Affleck. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody, although pretty much everybody has already seen it. The only reason people I think people loved it was because the creator's history. Face it, this sucked! It was still better than that gay Family Guy movie. 90 min. of laugh out loud comedy my ass. Overall, I give this movie a C.",Team America - World Police
288,ImOkayLarry,How do i write this review without swearing?,8,8 December 2006,"To put it simply, Team America is one of my favourite films ever, and definitely one of the best comedies ever made. Matt Stone and Trey Parker out do their previous south park movie with this hilarious and satirical action movie. oh yeah, and there's puppets...thats kinda important. the puppets lend a lot of the laughs to this film because the backgrounds and landscapes are so well made and completely believable, so seeing puppets that walk like retarded toddlers inhabit this world is sheer genius! Everything about Team America is so well made, including the songs (my favourite of which has to be the final 'Arec Barrwin' song! it's simply hilarious!) and the very clever use of props that you would certainly have to look twice to spot. I can't explain how much i love this film and i have seen it many many times since i first saw it in the cinema on it's release. It's a modern comedy classic, one of the funniest films in years, AND it's got puppet sex. There is one line that completely sums up the film; 'America- f*** yeah!'",Team America - World Police
289,plutokennedy,Dull and unfunny,2,12 January 2005,"I really enjoy 'South Park', but this movie is very disappointing. There are hardly any worthwhile jokes in the whole movie, not even the songs are entertaining. The makers of this movie decided for the cheap laughs by playing up clichés and prejudice and attacking outspoken (critically thinking) Hollywood celebrities. At the same time, the movie itself is very shallow and does not even attempt to provide any political insight, which I consider to be borderline hypocritical. The sets are nicely done, the puppets are fun at first but the novelty wears thin fast. All in all this film is a complete failure, both artistically and at the box office. I was glad when it was finally over.",Team America - World Police

No one believed it could be done. No-one dared to even think it ...except THEM ! Trey Parker & Matt Stone not only dared to think it, they actually did it, and successfully too ! Indeed, in hindsight, no one else COULD have pull this off, no way !!! Only the creators of South Park could make this new concept a success, and they did !!! I'm a regular visitor at the cinema, I go to the movies approx. 20-25 times a year, there's pretty much no comedy worth seeing that I haven't seen, and I swear to you : I haven't laughed this much in 12 years !!! I couldn't stop ! Here's some non-spoiling clues as to why this is the comedy of the decade : Have you ever seen a marionette fire off a machine-gun or a rocket launcher ? Have you ever heard a marionette say ""f**k"" ? Have you ever seen a marionette in a nude scene ? Have you ever seen a marionettes head explode ? ...and the no. 1 : Have you ever seen a marionette puke ??? If you have - you only THINK you have ! Go see the movie, you won't regret it !

291,Maw7391,Glad to see that I'm not the only one that hates actors nosing in politics.,10,12 March 2006,"I personally boycott many movies due to certain actors appearing in them. I don't care if they are liberal or not, how they vote is their business. I do however, hate it when they make their views abundantly clear. Support at a rally is fine if they are passionate but when the situation doesn't call for it, I can't stand it. At the Acedemy awards for instance. Any actor who has enough gall to voice their opinion on that grand stage should be banned from appearing again. It is embarrassing. They actually think that the public is so shallow or that we can't think for ourselves so they have to convince us how to vote. As if I were undecided and Susan Sarandon said to vote Democrat, I would jump at it. Thats a joke. The sad thing is that people like Ben Affleck were exposed that they were indeed not even registered to vote. I think this movie was an excellent slap in the Hollywood liberal face and that they had it coming for a very long time. I would respect any actor that was asked a political question if they said ""why are you asking me? I'm an actor not a political analyst."" Or if they said ""It doesn't matter what I think, let the people decide for themselves."" I know for a fact that I am not the only one who feels this way. These actors are only hurting themselves. No one will go see a movie they are in just because they are Democrat or Republican, but they sure as hell risk a lot of us not seeing one of their movies because they are. I think it took guts for those guys to poke fun at the overwhelming majority of Hollywood. Just for clarification, I am not a bible pounding Republican. Just a guy who gets mad when celebrities speak their mind on things they are clearly not qualified to do.",Team America - World Police
292,joakim-ericsson,An underrated masterpiece,10,22 April 2012,"I am quite surprised at the mediocre IMDb rating this movie has.Guess the explanation must be that no matter how brilliant it actually is, it is probably not for everyone. In my opinion this is Parker's and Stone's definite masterpiece, so far. Just the idea to use Thunderbirds-like puppets in creating a social satire action film that takes the p**s out of literally everyone, is outstanding.The puppets/characters look funny without being too silly, the puppeteering is brilliant (even when it looks corny), the environments are very well done and quite beautiful, the cliché action B-movie style and blockbuster rip-offs are simply amazing (the more Hollywood action blockbusters you've seen, the funnier this movie will be), and the jokes vary from crude and silly to refined and clever satire. The songs in the musical parts are in a league of their own, and almost deserve their own review.The first time I saw this movie was on DVD at a friends house. From the first minute I was collapsing from laughter, and it didn't stop until the movie was over. It was then 2 a clock in the morning, but I still asked my friend to borrow the DVD, then went straight home and watched it again, several times.I sometimes watch this movie again, and it is still very entertaining.Parker and Stone said that they will never do another puppet-movie, because it was such a nightmare making it. That is sad in one way, but on the other hand, they gave us this comedy masterpiece which will be very hard to top.10 out of 10 BRAVO!!!",Team America - World Police
293,TheHumbleCritic,North Korean Cartmann,7,17 May 2005,"""Team America"" is mostly a riot from start to finish. I say mostly because it's a little uneven in its humor, certainly not as consistently funny as the creators' predecessor, which was just itching to take the film away from the censors on Comedy Central. The new flick has splotches of dead plot advancement that rely too heavily on sitcom-like repetition for its laughs, like in moments where the main character must go through a period of self-reflection or when he tries to return and redeem himself to his policing comrades, which becomes a little too similar to those awful action flicks that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are trying to mock. The film also indulges in excessive vulgarity in some instances. As amusing as it might sound, the laughter slowly subsides after witnessing a puppet vomiting for nigh three minutes, or after hearing the same gay sex jokes again and again. Crassness for the sake of being crass, where profanities replace witticisms in the case of the Kim Jong Il puppet towards the end of the film, is surprisingly dry and boring.But aside from this, the film is bawdy and hilarious for those not too defensive about being left-leaning. In other words, if your idol is Tim Robbins for his politics and not his acting, than you might be disconcerted to see him take an NPR to the head. Or Matt Damon, who is portrayed as too stupid to say anything but his own name. And on and on. The great joy these writers take to show Michael Moore (hot dog and pizza in either hand) being blown up is only funny if you think these self-absorbed celebrities deserve it. Some critics have said the jokes stop being funny once they become too ""personal."" Well, they're only personal to the snobby, elitist film critics who hobnob and eat cheese regularly with these glamourpusses. That doesn't constitute 99.99% of us, so feel free to laugh without remorse.While the film is molded in the same framework of the aforementioned formulaic drivel, Parker and Stone are always mocking the genre while sending their own message and agenda. The guys are staunch Republicans as they skewer the celebrity left, Hans Blix, Peter Jennings, etc. But they also see the excess in which Americans indulge, both at home and abroad. A heat-seeking missile that ""missed the target"" in a crowded Parisian marketplace means the decimation of the Eiffel Tower, and in various instances they also nail Americans' obsession with their own isolated lives and relationships, particularly in an airplane dogfight scene where the characters simultaneously discuss who is sleeping with whom while shooting down North Korean jets. It is as much a satire as it is a parody, and the film does both to equally funny effect with sing-along numbers like ""'Pearl Harbor' Sucked, and I Need You."" But the puppets are the real meat of this film, and a special mention goes out to Kim Jong Il. He's a North Korean version of ""South Park's"" Cartmann, full of profanities, the same thirst for power, and the same whiny petulance. As a well-known lover of film (he kidnapped a Japanese director and made the poor fellow make a movie for him), Kim might be flattered with his portrayal here. His solo, ""I'm So Ronery,"" quite frankly steals the show.",Team America - World Police
294,garysjwa,"Funny, but mildly disappointing",7,10 June 2005,"Every now and then, something truly original finds its way on to TV or into movies. At first, it blows you away. But after a few years, followups and copycat efforts take the edge off of what was once mind-blowingly original. Team America: World Police seems to be that moment in the careers of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.This movie just didn't seem to have the magic of their previous efforts. I don't know if it's because the audience is accustomed to their brand of comedy by now, or if Team America simply wasn't their best work. Either way, this movie lands a little on the disappointing side, despite its hilarious premise.The characters were too one-dimensional, the satirical skewering of the Hollywood anti-war crowd was too mean-spirited, and they relied too much on pop-culture references in lieu of original gags. (Not to mention that a few of the original gags themselves fell flat.) Furthermore, the Parker/Stone duo needs to voice fewer characters. These guys aren't skilled enough to play ten roles apiece. Especially when they're the same ten voices their fans have been hearing for years. The character Joe sounds exactly like Mr. Garrison. I fully expected Peter Jennings to say ""The controversy began in the small mountain town of South Park,"" since he sounded like the generic news reporter from South Park and not at all like the real Peter Jennings.This unwanted intrusion of South Park severely damages Team America's ability to be funny and relevant in its own right. Had they not given the role of Spotswood to the talented Daran Norris, this movie might have come dangerously close to shark-jumping territory.But this is still a very funny movie. In spite of the disappointments, there are some real laugh-out-loud moments. Kim Il Jong (voiced by Parker) is a scream. The musical numbers are fun. And of course their trademark style of humor shines throughout the picture. There's still plenty to like here.This isn't Trey Parker's best work. But in an era where the competition for ""blockbuster summer comedy"" is unfunny garbage like Without A Paddle and White Chicks, a flick from the South Park team is always a welcome sight for comedy fans. Still, it's a little disappointing to see this movie fall short of the potential of its premise, and of its creators. I doubt there will be a Team America 2, but I'd love to see the boys take another whack at this.",Team America - World Police
295,whitefalcon79,I just... I don't know...,3,25 October 2004,"-- (Contains a brief, relatively inconsequential spoiler or two. Be warned.) --Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a couple of jackasses with brilliant comedic minds who happen to make some really funny stuff, even if their humour could be described as 'base-level'. I love South Park, I loved BASEketball, I loved Orgazmo...I wanted, so badly, to love Team America: World Police. I just... I don't know...The premise of the movie seems funny (and scarily true) enough; a band of hotshots called Team America go out looking for terrorists, looking for weapons of mass destruction, looking for rogue nations who have either of the above, and coming in with all guns blazing and little regard for collateral damage (including and especially world-renowned landmarks). Oh, and did I mention the added humorous aspect of it all being done with the aid of Thunderbirds-esque marionettes?After that, it just seems to fall flat. It's like they tried to cram too much funny into one movie and wound up making it not-very-funny at all. I have to admit this is largely due to the fact that my tiny little brain spent most of the movie's duration trying to work out exactly which side Trey and Matt were on. Were they mocking the Bush administration's rush-to-war mentality, Al Qaeda (what you saw of Osama Bin Laden in the previews is all you'll see of him), North Korea, Michael Moore, liberal Hollywood, or all of the above and then some? Sorry, guys, but if you want this to be really drop-dead funny, you've got to pick one target and stay with them.That said, there are some genuinely funny moments, including but not limited to the more 'intimate' moment between Gary and Lisa. This alone satisfied my curiosity of just what it would have looked like if a couple of the characters in the Thunderbirds had got it on.All in all, I think Team America: World Police just tried too hard to be too funny. It reminds me of a bottle of soda that you tighten the cap on as far as it will go until you turn it one revolution too many and it comes off completely. It's worthy of a few chuckles, but not the absolute laugh riot I expected it would be, given the names behind it.",Team America - World Police

That being said, the creators have had their work go into unfunny directions when they get caught up on their own right wing leaning philosophy and outright savaging of all pop icons they don't like. Team America is their bad habits at their most bloated.The biggest problem I have with the film is this -- it's not funny. It's pretty much puppets swearing, repetitive gay jokes, repetitive gags for that matter that get old real fast (case in point, the vomit scene). Finally they lost a lot of focus and momentum when they focused a lot on their attacks on the left wing and by the left wing I mean Hollywood...look there are inflated egos and I enjoy seeing excellent satire at their expense. What Team America offers is beyond overkill. I mean, WHY obsessively attack Hollywood stars? They're annoying but they're also inconsequential. I just found it to be more akin to bullying than actual satire.In a way, it's a lot like Starship Troopers -- a misguided attempt at satire that ends up promoting a very authoritarian right wing message.",Team America - World Police

299,Veektarius,South Park's creators fail to explore their limits,6,22 October 2004,"All sorts of people are talking about the political satire of this movie. It contrasts American stupidity (the same stupidity that exists in the country with most of the finest universities in the world)with Foreign pansiness, coming to the inevitable conclusion that we need both types in order to get by in the end.. but it does so in a way that isn't at all apologetic to the pansies. The most centrist remark that this movie makes is to say it's better not to blow up an entire country in order to save the world.. not very centrist at all, I think.I came out of this movie unenlightened, and though I had laughed throughout at the cheap humor, and a few scenes that were so outrageous that one couldn't help it the first time, I also came out fairly sickened at its treatment of politics While I don't agree with actors, they're certainly better spoken than Trey Parker gives them credit for, and better spoken than he himself. In the end, I decided, these are people who have contributed far more to the American public in their movies than South Park has, and perhaps that gives them a right to have their opinions heard. Its not as if anyone listens, anyway. And it leaves politicians untouched, unmentioned even. Not a very political movie after all, is it?At the end of the day, I decided it deserves six stars for entertaining me while in the theater, but no more because I felt that the laughs were almost completely shock value and would deteriorate given repeated viewings.",Team America - World Police
300,Tazmanhomie,Typically Parker/Stone,9,6 February 2005,"It doesn't take a genius to realise how smart and tactful Parker and Stone are when it comes to the social commentary that South Park provides. So, when the war on terror rolled around, they recognised how divisive the issue was and realised that perhaps they should wait until the political climate cooled before tearing shreds out of it. However, once this had happened, they had only released one war-on-terror-based episode of South Park (ep. 100: I'm a Little Bit Country, about the debate between factions of the community, rather than the war itself) and as such had an absolute mass of material to work with - enough for four or five episodes. So, with material coming out of every orifice, they saw no choice but to do what they promised never to do again - make a movie. And while, as they claim, 'it nearly killed them,' they have produced one of the most brilliant social commentary pieces in years - in the ilk of, although decidedly cruder and less subtle than, the classic Animal Farm.The film is remembered by many for its crudities - particularly its puppet sex scene, Matt Damon's limited conversational skills, some creative death scenes, spoofs of Middle Eastern language, and the mother of all chunder scenes. While for most adolescent minds such as my own, those scenes are very funny indeed, they were not the most rewarding aspects of the film. The main focuses of satire are outspoken left-wingers, the Americo-centred view of the world, and the shoot-first, ask-later 'policy,' and all are done rather expertly. Also causing side-splitting laughter from yours truly were criticisms of the soft approach of the UN, and the tunnel-vision anti-corporationism of the left (something South Park has given a touch-up several times). Finally, the climax - the analogy speech - was perhaps the funniest and most clever summary of any situation in a long while.It's rude and crude, but at the same time completely brilliant. But South Park fans have come to expect nothing less.",Team America - World Police
301,dan-howes,All involving puppets,10,30 July 2007,"A big part of what makes ""Team America: World Police"" such a comedic masterpiece is that everything that happens (gun fights, explosions, Inspiring Messages, sex) is depicted with puppets. It makes sense that Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the writer/directors of this film, originally wanted to use the script from ""Armageddon"". They ended up changing their plans due to legal problems, but the film is essentially the same. By throwing in every conceivable Big Action Movie cliché, Parker and Stone have made perhaps the most perfect send-up ever of the all those Michael Bay explosion movies. The stars of the film are Team America, a group of special government agents. They don't fight terrorism, they seek it out and obliterate it, even if that means destroying most of Paris in the process. There are those out to stop our intrepid band of All-American Heroes, including Kim-Jong Il, and various Hollywood liberals such as George Clooney, Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore, and Sean Penn (who apparently wrote an angry letter to Parker and Stone in response to this film. Christ, Sean, get a sense of humor). And then there's the soundtrack, which is something else entirely. From the ""Montage Song"", to ""I Miss You, And Pearl Harbor Sucked"", every song is priceless and hilarious. ""Team America: World Police"" succeeds on just about every level.

304,supergiantbugkiller,"good for half an hour, then kaput",1,21 October 2004,"Team America is inherently funny for about a half an hour. The puppets are awkward and funny, its fast paced, quirky, colorful and you hear the Team America theme (the movies biggest laugh) for the first time....but it wears thin quickly. Eventually Team America becomes a rehash of themes and even direct items stolen from Parker and Stones' own show, South Park. Whether its the Kim Jong-Il crossbreed of Cartman and the City Wok guy, the Montage song, the mock of country music exploiting 9/11, the 'd*cks/p*ssies' paraphrase from the end of South Parks ""I'm a little bit country"", its rehash.There are many things Parker and Stone could have done to make this movie better. for one, hiring actual VOICE ACTORS and differentiating this much much more from South Park. Think of their TV show ""thats my bush"". The show wasn't so great but imagine if all the actors had been voiced by Parker/Stone instead. It was the sitcom setup with real actors and NEW voices that made it better than it might have been otherwise.Second, make the political satire way more sharp. Parker/Stone don't know much about politics. The actor characters aren't given any individual personality to make the barbs poked at them funny at all. Eg, the only joke about Michael Moore is that he's fat. come on, there's way more to go with. The whole actor satire is a complete failure. And since it wasn't funny, it gave me time to think past the movie into what hypcrites Parker/Stone are for saying what they're saying about Hollywood. As much as Hollywood actors can annoy me as well, face it, Parker/Stone wade into politics just as much if not more than many other actors. I've never even heard Ethan Hawke or Sam Jackson (two targets in TA:WP) get political, but Parker/Stone put their views into their work, and in their interviews as well, all the fricking time. Many newspaper articles have been written about their views. As much as Parker/Stone hate Hollywood, they are celebrities, and are as guilty as the targets they hit in TA:WP. Maybe they should have inserted themselves somewhere in there as a cameo. I'd have made them a Beavis/Butthead type figures, laughing at everyone from the sidelines, eventually getting killed by TA or the actors... or both.The movie is also way too long. And repetitive. A few of the best jokes in the movie get worn WAYYYYY into the ground. There's a marionette fight scene at the beginning of the film where it doesn't look right. Its a funny scene, but its a metaphor for the entire movie. The puppets eventually become boring, they dnot have much character to them and Parker/Stone haven't put much life into their personalities themselves. It gets REALLY boring. and since as an action movie satire its so close, without the humor or character its just as boring as any Michael Bay movie they parody.And thats the biggest crime. For this, despite a great first 1/2 hour, I cant recommend this movie. Its a 4/10, and the biggest disappointment in years.",Team America - World Police
305,swisswuff,Brilliant and deeply biting satire,10,15 April 2005,"This brilliant and deeply biting satire was probably not shot as a slapstick piece that reveals obvious humor to administration supporters. It is much rather a slightly exaggerated take on reality that draws it's humor from reality's surreal absurdity. so to speak. This movie excels through razor sharp observation far more than it excels through delivery of cheap punch lines - even though there are some 'punch lines' that could make you wrongly assume you would be watching some type of puppet theater.This movie abounds with subtleties that extend far beyond the 'political'. As one example, the dialogs surrounding Gary's way back into 'the team' by being nice to his boss' best piece are a 'real book standard'! And while the movie has 'Team America' blow up, among other places, Paris, reality has Europe stuffed with US nukes that are stacked together in some camps with a small amount of guards - so, that's not funny either.This movie leaves no question about which country, in fact, classifies as rogue state number one in the year 2004, but of course, you would have to watch the movie yourself in order to make up your mind about this.",Team America - World Police
306,EHrmns,This could have been funny,3,28 July 2009,"When I read the synopsis of this movie it seemed like a great idea. A team that is supposed to save the world ends up destroying it instead. After the first Paris scene this seemed possible and hopes were high. However the movie soon changes gear and ends up being as boring and predictable as any Hollywood Blockbuster. Yes there are some slightly funny scenes during those long 98 minutes but overall it is tedium. Probably the worst are the songs which just repeat the same words over and over again. Using the word f*ck a hundred times might have been brave 40 years ago. Nowadays everybody has heard it all and when it is repeated to death a big yawn is the result. If a movie tries to parody something it has to be at least a bit funny, otherwise watch Top Gun, now that was hilarious.",Team America - World Police
307,Nirvanabreed5944-1,Continuing a tradition of great movies.,10,11 October 2004,"Matt and Trey have outdone themselves again.I had little hope for a film in the ballpark of the South Park movie. To me the previews made it look out to be something without direct jokes and gags, and just a large ball of satire for the film industry and the United State's policing actions acrossed the world that would run dry in about 20 minutes.Man, how wrong I was.Team America's political side reminds me of a show like The Simpsons or The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in the fact that it doesn't even attempt to offer a real solution to anything. The emphasis is making out both sides of an issue to be as ridiculous as possible. It makes the right look like trigger-happy, ignorant, jackasses. And then it makes the left look like whiney babies, who have no idea what they're talking about, and who just want to spout out their views of a perfect world at all costs. Liberal Hollywood at least. The humor side was an all out ball. Easily tops any moment in any of this year's top comedies like Anchorman with a gag about every 3 minutes. Of course, people will disagree with me on that, but with all comedies the quality differs from person to person. Overall, if you loved South Park: B L & UC then you'll love this humor as well.There's also a few inside jokes for people who regularly watch South Park and other things as well. Several Star Wars references had me on the floor.Things like the montage song, and the general idea that America likes to ""have their cake and eat it too"" flow through the movie for anyone who notices.The movie is not for everyone. There's lots of strong language used, and even gratuitous puppet sex.There's also an idea that the movie attacks the left. I guess this is just because people are used to people attacking the right and that gets filtered out. It's pretty bi-partisan in its making fun of people, but I guess you could say that if you left the main plot and almost all of the themes of the movie, as well as the title, and half the satire, you could say that it attacks the left more. I guess you could say that towards the end of the 2nd act and most of the 3rd, it starts to go after the left more than the right and that's what people come out thinking about. So what if they don't like actors telling us their political views? They're actors, it's not an actor or entertainer has gotten in to office in the US before.",Team America - World Police

But after about 5 minutes you forget they are even there. The puppet-masters are so good you get sucked right into the story. Political intrigue, romance, backstabbing actors, fast cars, hot women, lots of guns and ammo...what more could you ask for? There are a few things about this movie that are, well, just not right. For example, the puppet sex scene - way over the top. The bar scene was a little much too, but overall, this movie is in my top 5 of all time. If you like SouthPark humor (same guys), then you will love this movie. There are real people (actors, actresses and political figures) portrayed by marionettes in this movie. A few of the funniest are Kim-Jung Il and Matt Damon. You will not be disappointed! 10+ Stars",Team America - World Police
309,jickweez-1,The problems with Team America....,3,16 June 2005,"The reason this movie bombed at the box office wasn't its edginess or controversy (those would be assets in other hands), but that it wasn't all that funny. Viewers need to sit through scenes upon scenes of vapid, inane dialogue and situations (mostly g-rated fluff) before getting to anything that sparks of irony or humor. The cobbled together plot (a team of young puppets who destroy everything in its path in the name of ""freedom"") could have been dreamed up one night during a cub scout sleepover. I found myself dozing off in many parts of the movie. Only towards the end when the ""celebrities"" get their just desserts does it become interesting. I'm a huge fan of South Park (very original, very ironic humor) but this movie really missed the mark on just about every front - except being a formulaic action flick along the lines of the forgettable Armageddon or Pearl Harbor. I give this three stars for the three slightly humorous scenes - one being the deleted ""sex"" scene.",Team America - World Police
310,stuart_mcmillen,Great moments do not make a great movie,5,22 April 2005,"After the terrorism events of the early 2000s comes 'Team America: World Police' by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the team behind South Park. I'm a pretty big fan of South Park and 'That's My Bush!', but have found the other movies that they've been involved with in the past (Orgasmo and BASEketball) to be pretty sub-par.Firstly, I'll just say that the puppets and the puppeteering work in this movie is very impressive; it certainly would have taken a long time to build all the sets and choreograph the numerous puppets that are on screen at each time.As to the MOVIE itself, there were some fantastic moments in this film (eg: 'montage', the early marriage proposal, 'there are three kinds of people'), but however these weren't enough to hold up the whole film, as many of the scenes were pretty boring, with no jokes (or worse, repetition of jokes that have already been used). Also, unlike similar shows/movies like South Park, you just didn't CARE about what happened to the Team America members; they were just there to facilitate the story line.As I said earlier, even though there are some great jokes here, that is not enough to make the MOVIE as a whole great. Team America is good for a watch, but don't expect a classic comedy movie. 5/10",Team America - World Police

Because this opus didn't tweak it at all.Hey, I have no problem with violence, crudity, profanity, sex, and viciously funny satire aimed at everyone possible. Problem is, none of the violence, crudity, profanity and sex worked for me, and the viciously funny satire, well... just wasn't.Full disclosure: half the movie was all I could stand before hitting the EJECT button on the player. I then proceeded downstairs to the shop where I cut the disk in half with a pair of tin snips so there wouldn't be the slightest chance that any other person would ever make the mistake of playing that particular copy. It's most certainly the only time I've ever done THAT.I figure at least there's a spare case if one in the collection wears out.

This movie feels like a 5 minute skit that was extended to 90 minutes. The plot is clichéd, the dialogue pathetic, the jokes repetitive and the musical numbers annoying. There are several offending scenes throughout the film. But I won't go into details because it is just too gross. The movie pokes fun at celebrities like Michael Moore, Alec Baldwim and Matt Damon to name a few. I admit it does have a couple funny moments though. I liked the Matt Damon character but that was not enough to make this movie worthwhile. Do not let your friends convince you to see this movie at the theater.

After seeing this masterpiece of a mockery audiences can never again accept formulaic movie methods such as the ""montage"". Big budget adventure epics will never be taken seriously ever again. This marks the end of cookie-cutter studio blockbusters. From this point forward, in order to appeal to audiences, films will have to present original story lines and plot points. This means that almost all writers and producers will be out of a job. The entertainment industry will now require creativity. Hollywood will never be the same.

The use of marionettes was an unusual choice, but thanks to the great puppetry and designs, they work very well.The story is just really there to serve the increasingly twisted humor of Trey and Matt's vision. And it works perfectly. There are at least three scenes which made the audience (and me) in the theater laugh out very loud - that is something that very few comedies in recent times have been able to accomplish.I was surprised how much I enjoyed Team America; but then I really enjoy South Park. A very entertaining (adult) cinematic excursion for the South Park creators, and an impressive display of puppetry skills (for which the sex scenes will be remembered! :)",Team America - World Police
315,roger-a,stand in the middle and blow raspberries at both sides,6,18 October 2004,"SPOILERSI love South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have given us an episode of SP. Its the one where the 'redneck war lovers', at the end of the show, embrace the 'hippie peace-nicks' because then America can be looked at as sensitive but also the ass-kickers of world. This time its with marionettes.TA;WP is just that. But standing in the middle and making fun of both the left and right isn't terribly gutsy. In TA, they take a position. By making fun of the various celebrities (who are the voices of dissent of the current war), throughout the picture and calling them 'fags' 'pussies' and putting them on side of a North Korean dictator, they take a position.They're terribly creative in using marionettes. The humor is more of the same... sex/violence/extended vomiting, and I laughed. But its starting to wear a little thin. If you like South Park, you'll like TA... UNLESS you also see the war with Iraq as terribly tragic, lie infested, overly simplified and something we must not allow to continue. Then you may be frustrated while watching.Had they not spent so much time making fun of and 'killing' those celebrities who have spoken out (especially Michael Moore), I wouldn't have minded. This could have been a great satire.But if you think there is a possibility that the world can be a more human place then that makes you a 'pussy'. According to Trey and Matt, anyway.",Team America - World Police
316,J_7,Torture,1,6 January 2005,"Parker and Stone have managed, yet again, to invent a new form of torture. Between the soundtrack and the repulsive and humorless puppet sex scene, I want my $1.50 back. Granted, their take on parodying American politics and society was pretty accurate but their parody on the countries we are at war with was offensive. Apparently my sense of humor doesn't sink so low. I couldn't force myself to laugh at the ridiculous way in which they managed to portray us exactly how our enemies see us. It made me sad to see so many people in the audience laughing at what they don't realize is what makes America a joke. I hated it. It isn't even worth the 1 point I voted on it but I had to vote something to write about how awful this movie truly is.",Team America - World Police
317,coolkycouple2004,Brilliant! (Slight spoilers),9,21 October 2004,"I love the way this movie is going over peoples heads. From IMDb reviewers to the famed Roger Ebert himself, this movie separates the yokels from the open minded comedy fans..exactly what Matt and Trey had in mind, I'm sure. For starters I give credit to the two for doing something fresh. I cant remember the last time I sat in the theater and thought ""This is something I've never seen before"". I was saying that through the whole film. I know the guys didn't invent puppets..but they sure reinvented them for a whole new generation, and for that they rock.Secondly, this movie is funny. Very funny. I don't know why people around the world thought this movie was going to be Farenhieht 911 with puppets..its just a comedy. Sure, it has some world figures and current event ties in the story, but so what. I hate to break it to Ebert and the rest of the people who didn't get this movie..but there is nothing political about Hans Blix being eaten by sharks. There is no political statement being made by a puppet vomiting in an alley numerous times, or two puppets having sex, it's just funny.And everyone is so freaked about the portrayal of Hollywood actors in this movie...these people have never seen South Park or heard Matt and Trey interviewed. They cant stand ultra-rich celebrities,whos main talent is pretending, that push their politics on us normal folks. And I agree with them..and applaud their balls(Ha!) for showing famous people for what they really are inside(Barbara Striesand)and making it hilarious.With great music, killer jokes, and amazing visual comedy, Team America is one of a kind.My rating...8 out of 10. F*** YEAH!",Team America - World Police
318,chimpanzee_boyuk,Funny as Hell!,9,27 December 2006,"Film spoofs don't get much ruder, cruder and funnier than this! Puppet sex, stereotypical Americans and underdog foreigners (fortunately and surprisingly, no insults poked at the British {Yeah!}). However, I think it starts off great with the Paris fight scene (especially when they just randomly fire a missile at the Eiffel Tower, which crushes the Arc De Triomphe in the process!), but by the time we got to the fight scene in Kim Jong Il's palace, the humour had gone a bit rusty (apart from when Kim Jong Il impales himself on the Kaiser's helmet; quality!). Nonetheless, definitely worth watching if you want a good laugh and a chance to poke fun at terrorism, world affairs and North Korea! 8/10! F*CK YEAH!!!!!!!!!!",Team America - World Police

It's a classic of our time...""America. F**k Yeah!"" I can just picture the guys with the ""Terrorist Hunting Permits"" on their pickups singing along with this song like it's the next ""I'm Proud to be An American!"" The whole ""world police"" idea is great - making fun of the fact that we are jumping into situations without understanding them, blowing up a lot of stuff, and declaring victory. The technical achievement of this movie is pretty impressive (not the puppet sex scene which looks like stuff I did with my Barbies & that's what makes it funny - I mean the action scenes).",Team America - World Police
320,Ben_Deutsch,simply brilliant.,10,9 October 2004,"I just saw this movie, sneak preview. and i have to say. Holy Crap. This movie is so ridiculous. but don't take that as bad ridiculous.Michael Moore made a point in Fahrenhiet 9/11. That point was that George W Bush failed America. Trey Parker and Matt Stone say, George Bush didn't mess things up, just us being Americans mess things up.Now, before I start my review I will say this, I am a libertarian read: old school republican. And I am absolutely scared to death of those damn puppets from Thunderbirds. First off, This movie is genius. First came Baseketball and it was good. Then came South Park, Bigger, Longer, And Uncut, and it too was good. And now comes Team America: World Police, and it is amazing.Why? you ask? ""This guy has said this movie is genius like fifty thousand times and still hasn't substantiated!"" you might say. Well here goes.This film definitely portrays how the rest of the world sees the United States. Though you still know that the filmmakers are damn proud to be Americans, and surely believe in what we stand for, considering their constant belittling of Kim jong Il. But that is an interesting point of view to make a film from. Even Micheal Moore's films don't say hey, us Americans are portrayed as pigs.Secondly, the story is actually good. Cliché, but actually good. All the characters are flushed out, and in a typical south park fashion. The political commentary is scathing, along with all the satire that runs rampant throughout the film.Thirdly, some shots are actually quite dramatic and the cinematography is fairly decentNext, the original soundtrack, like the song, ""America, F*** YEAH!"" and "" I miss you as much as pearl harbor sucked.""Lastly, the 5 minute vomiting scene.10/10. See it, laugh your ass off.",Team America - World Police
321,knightblade2001,So Republican it has to be Democratic,9,9 October 2004,"I just got back from a sneak preview of ""Team America: World Police"" and it is outstanding. I have always been frightened of puppets. Today gave me a new reason to be afraid. Trey Parker and Matt Stone were amazing in this hilarious parody of the United States view on the 'War on Terrorism."" The film opens with a quick viewing of what ""Team America' really do. They utterly obliterate terrorists. And thats an understatement. Then the true plot is uncovered. So Team America recruits an actor to join their ranks as a spy. From then on the comedy only gets better. Kim Jong Il'as the antagonist can only remind the audience of Cartmen. He is portrayed as an evil little dictator who wants to destroy free society. And Team America have to stop him from doing so.If you have seen ""South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut"" (1999) you will understand the musical score chosen. The songs are all written only for this movie. The songs are hilarious and completely offensive to those that they are directed to. I must say, that this film is an excellent watch. Its not tasteful, however it is a good laugh. If you have ever wonder what exactly can happen to a puppet in ANY situation, watch this movie. The republican's never-ending desire to wipe out terrorism is illustrated in a liberal democratic style in this film. Enjoy.**** out of *****",Team America - World Police
322,mjbridges82,"Too little, too long.",4,21 April 2005,"The political climate and events of recent years have proved rich pickings for comedians, satirists, and those who simply like to take the proverbial p**s. Team America: World Police falls firmly within the last category, primarily because it has nothing to say, and is only occasionally amusing. Produced almost entirely using impressively sophisticated Super Marrionette style puppets, Team America plays like something the South Park kids would watch for want of Terrance & Phillip re-runs.The action follows the eponymous anti-terrorist crusaders in an attempt to thwart a conspiracy involving everyone's favourite North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, and a group of obnoxiously vocal left wing actors led by Alec Baldwin. Well, at least a surprisingly acute imitation of Alec Baldwin. Unlike the often entirely irreverent, and occasionally irrelevant 'cameos' on Stone and Parker's long running South Park, the celebrity impersonations here are recognisably faithful. Only Matt Damon gets the silly treatment with a 'Timmyesque' inability to articulate anything other than his own name.Though Team America is undoubtedly a product of it's time and spurred by the actions of, and reactions to, the present Bush administration, it shies from indulging in any overt Republican/Democrat jibes. The lampooning is instead aimed at the nauseatingly jingoistic cinema of the Bay/Bruckheimer school, a soft yet deserving target. The whole film assumes the macho, self righteous attitude of blockbusters such as Armageddon, and intermittently even seems to genuinely revel in it. This is in part due to the lack of genuine, consistent laughs. As anybody familiar with the long running, and marginally popular, animated show South Park would expect, the level of humour here is crude, low brow, and eager to offend. The infamous sex scene is well realised, and despite the puppets being entirely Barbie & Ken in the wedding tackle department, i.e. bereft, humorously prudish censors still deemed it necessary to be cut extensively in order to avoid the dreaded NC17 rating.The movie benefits greatly by the efforts of cinematographer Bill Pope, taking a break from the digital extravagance of previous works on Spider-Man 2 and the Matrix sequels, in favour of a far more tangible project. The sets are lively and a semi-running gag involving the destruction of world landmarks is well executed. Despite the fact the puppets are obviously imbued with technology that would make Captain Scarlet turn green, they still 'walk' in pleasingly comical fashion, and wires are knowingly left on display. Although initially amusing, this conceit isn't sufficient to make up for the weak jokes. I only laughed two or three times, the alternative cyanide capsule and the 'panthers' being stand outs for me. The Kim Jong Il portrayal was mildly amusing, mainly because he sounded like Cartman doing an Oriental impression, and Cartman is funny. The customary musical pieces are hit and miss. The country flavoured freedom song, and the familiarly earnest cock-rock theme tune are well done if a little obvious, but ditties like the Michael Bay baiting Pearl Harbour ballad fall flat. By far the best piece, and through its virtue one of the strongest scenes in the film, is the homage to hoary old montage device. It should serve as a telling indication of the quality of this film that 'Montage', rather than being a bespoke piece, was in fact lifted from a season 6 episode of South Park. In short, far from the uncle-f**king, Canadian-blaming heights of 1999's South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut. Sound wise, the voice acting is fine and effects functional. The keen of hearing and geek of thinking will be pleased by an appearance of the Wilhelm scream.The climatic reel of the film falls foul of some predictably lazy Matrix and Kill Bill references, which surely everybody must be tired of by now, though the subversion of the vitriolic hero monologue in the final scene succeeds in being cleverly obscene. The recurring feeling I experienced while watching Team America was that it's been before far more effectively. I found a lot of the jokes fell flat because of slack timing and unusually stodgy editing, curious considering films like Armageddon have cuts every 2 seconds. BBC3s animated series Monkey Dust nailed the Bruckheimer blockbuster far more effectively and humorously within a 10 minute sketch, in fact South Park, though wildly uneven, has produced material infinitely superior in a similar ilk. I can't help but feel that this type of material would have faired far better in the hands of Abrahams and the Zuckers for a Hot Shots!, Naked Gun style treatment. Overall, Team America: World Police is far too indifferent about its subjects to be able to penetrate to the vain of truth that runs through all good comedy, and simply perpetuates the fallacy that it's cool to treat everything with disregard.",Team America - World Police

Nearly each jokes is either a s**t, a p***e or a c**k joke. The shocking-concept of south park worked out quite well at the beginning of the cartoon-series. Now it it's out-dated! Is there a deeper meanings trough all this vulgarity? Well surely it is, but it should be displayed more wisely, not so obviously. All those low-jokes were absolutely not necessary. It is a way too easy sort of humor. Still! The movie remains sometimes a very funny, intelligent and sarcastic one, but not to often. And in the end i would say: It was definitely made for geeks, that proof themselves more stupid as they are, by swallowing a semi-true product.

I was expecting the satire to be a little more even-handed, with both the right and the left being lampooned, but Parker and Stone saved their most savage (and I do mean savage) attacks for the likes of Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. The reason the filmmakers chose to portray Moore in such a harsh light is because they say that people mistook a piece of animation in ""Bowling for Columbine"" for their work. Is that Moore's fault? Their message seems to be ""Liberal = Bad."" I don't think that celebs who speak out against the war are as bad as, say, the chickenhawk politicians who conceived the wrongheaded ""Operation Iraqi Freedom"" and the Patriot Act. I didn't miss the point that ""Team America"" is arrogant and reckless, but I do think that the film's ""message"" is undercut by its nastiness and misplaced venom toward the Hollywood Left, and even more by the witless, half-baked script. That said, I'd like to add that I am a fan of ""South Park."" Maybe if they had written a part for Cartman, I wouldn't have hated this movie so much.",Team America - World Police

This is where Team America fails. The film is at its best when it tries to be funny. The songs are also hilarious and well written, my favourites being Pearl Harbor Sucks and I'm Lonely. Due to a lack of jokes towards the middle of the film it becomes slightly boring. However don't give up watching it as you will be treated to some of the best jokes of the entire film.

This film is a scathing attack of absolutely every aspect of the 'War on Terror', even the conscientious celebrities, and the ranting hot-dog munching Michael Moore.not only do these guys manage to insult everyone, they even manage to throw in some parodies of other films- the action sequence in France at the start is the FUNNIEST thing I've seen this year, and the 'American' attack on Terror, in the style of so many Hollywood big budget Action films, actually had me crying with laugher.Anyone who watches this film will totally GET the jokes-(apart from Bush maybe?)and if you're a south park fan already you will NOT be disappointed.

This film is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. All the references to political events and bad movies (most of which I found to be true) only generated more laughs, as well as the film not taking itself too seriously.This film follows the journey of Broadway actor Gary Johnston. One day, he is recruited by Team America and is sprung right into a plan spearheaded by the notorious Kim Jong Il, which also involves the terrorists of Durkadurkastan and the Film Actors Guild.""Team America: World Police"" has what has got to be the funniest script in film history. The intelligence and stupidity of it just provides you with endless laughter. But despite all the jokes, whether they be dumb or smart, ""Team America: World Police"" is still able to deliver a decent storyline about a man overcoming his personal demons to save the world. This film, as I said before, doesn't take itself too seriously, for example you can clearly see the strings of the puppets throughout the whole movie. For some, this may not work, but for me this just added to the laughs. Even the sadder scenes, which are still sad, are funny as well. Every time you stop laughing, another funny line or scene is shown and you're never given a break.With all of this considered, ""Team America: World Police"" has got to be the benchmark for not just inappropriate or politically incorrect comedies, but just comedies as a whole, as it is one of film's funniest.Rating: 9.7/10Grade: A+",Team America - World Police

The other half I didn't expect, but only laughed at half of the half meaning I laughed at only 25% of the jokes in this film. I guess I don't have a sense of humor, but oh well. I will give the movie credit though for not seeming...long. I will say I was bored in some scenes, sometimes flipping my cell phone open and looking at the time. I did like a few things, the puking scene, Micheal Moore blowing up, the ending, and Phil Hendrie as INTELLIGENCE. Besides that I merely sat through and watched or didn't like things. The celebrities dieing is too beautiful to put into words.

Vulgar language, adult situations, and violence make this for at least the 17+ crowd. Having said that, as an adult, I think that this ridiculous, irreverent movie is GREAT! The creators managed to thinly cloak serious political commentary in a veil of entertaining, often ridiculous hilarity. I would not recommend that anyone under the age of eighteen be allowed to view this movie due to adult content and situations. For adults, however, this movie is silly, smart, and generally speaking hugely enjoyable. The fact that the cast is entirely made of puppets in no way detracts from the brilliant cinematography; the brilliantly executed action may cause you to lose sight of the puppet-cast.

(Kids, that means they are actually making fun of the of the unnecessary use of coarse language, violence and graphic sexual content in movies - to a degree. I do realize that they also took great delight in the use of those things.) It's not a ""kiddie"" movie. It is a politically accurate action movie, with more spoofs than you can imagine.

The gore level may have been high, but the swear-word count was actually surprisingly low (compared to SP) -- I'm not sure what the fuss is about.Definitely worth a see for Trey/Matt fans and like-minded non-fans, but don't expect another SP:BLU.",Team America - World Police
336,quentar,"Very funny, but no ""South Park"" (SPOILERS)",7,10 October 2004,"*** out of ****Satire is tough to get right. Filmmakers who attempt it have a tough assignment: in order to spoof their subject, they must use the subject's tools but twist them in such a way as to make them funny. One wrong move and their film becomes what they're trying to satirize. This quandary came to mind while I was sitting through the slower stretches of ""Team America: World Police"". While the film is funny - often gut-bustingly so - creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone too frequently fall victim to the idea that the audience cares about the film's plot. This is often true of the action movies they're trying to parody.The film starts in Paris (which, a title helpfully explains, is some 3,000 miles east of America) where terrorists are plotting to set off a weapon of mass destruction. Suddenly Team America arrives to stop them. Team America is an elite fighting force dispatched to destroy terror worldwide. They are also puppets. Yes, that's right, puppets. You may wonder how puppets are going to fight terrorists, but when the terrorists are puppets too, you could say it's a fair fight after all.(SPOILER ALERT) A member of Team America dies in battle. To replace him, the group's director heads to New York to recruit a Broadway actor named Gary Johnston. (He's the lead in the hit show ""Lease"", featuring the immortal song, ""Everybody Has AIDS"".) Bowled over by Johnston's incredible, though somewhat wooden, acting ability, he offers the thespian the chance to join Team America. His assignment: use his acting chops to infiltrate a terror cell in Egypt.Gary joins the team and immediately falls for the blond, blue-eyed Lisa, who's still reeling from her boyfriend's death. They make love in a sequence that must be seen to be believed. (That they are not anatomically correct doesn't seem to matter, except to the MPAA, which almost slapped the film with an NC-17 for this scene. Those people need to get out more.)The rest of the plot deals with the Team's efforts to stop Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il from launching WMD's at strategic points around the globe. Kim Jong, who sounds like Elmer Fudd crossed with ""South Park""'s Cartman, plans to do this while hosting a ""world peace conference"" featuring many well-known liberal celebrities, including Alec Baldwin, the head of the Film Actors Guild (check the initials).In the midst of all this are some of the funniest moments to grace a theater screen all year. There are song parodies, gross-out moments, ridiculously foul dialogue; Parker and Stone will stop of nothing to get the audience laughing.But getting to those funny bits means putting up with the clichéd plot and dialogue, and that's when I got antsy. I know Parker and Stone are trying to spoof the clichés they've seen in hundreds of action movies, but just having puppets spout those clichés doesn't make them funny in and of themselves. There has to be a point-of-view taken, a twist on the proceedings to deflate those big budget thrillers. Unfortunately, they seem to forget that as the film plods on.This may make it sound like I didn't enjoy ""Team America"", but nothing could be further from the truth. I laughed, laughed, and laughed some more. There were moments where my sides ached from laughing so much. And despite my wish that Parker and Stone hadn't gotten so bogged down with the plot, I guess I shouldn't be too critical of a puppet movie. Especially one with a scene that gives ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" a run for its money.",Team America - World Police
337,greg-glen,"a great technical job, but the humour could have been better",7,7 July 2008,"""Team America: World Police"" is a great technical achievement and is reasonably funny as a satire on the state-of-the-world at that time. The funniest bits are, of course, the sex scene and Kim Jong-Il's song and the DVD is worth buying or renting for those scenes alone. The satire on Hollywood is pointed but perhaps not pointed enough. For example, when a certain rotund progressive filmmaker blows himself, he should have cried despondently,""I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR CRAPTACULARS!!!"" I think Parker et al missed a golden opportunity to maybe have some of the progressives, both male and female, be sexually attracted to Kim Jong-Il and make sexual passes at him. The eccentric North Korean dictator could respond in a coy, high school girlish sort of way. When Team America blows things up, Greenpeace could protest that it's depleting the ozone. And so forth. Missed opportunities, eh, boys? Parker and his particeps criminis seem to come dangerously close to saying that actors and celebrities don't have any right to have any opinions about the world at large. They think they're puncturing Hollywood pomposity, but they seem to be saying,""why don't they just kick back and think about nothing?"" The satirists then become as empty as that which they purport to satirise. Personally, if I had been a celebrity, I would have cooperated utterly with the boys here under the condition that if I could have thought of a way of making myself look even worse(and it was funny), it would have been written into the film. The failure of some celebs here to cooperate in the filming of this indicates a serious lack of both humour and perspective. While I think the film is more smart-ass than smart, I give it a solid recommendation. It's consistently funny and in bad taste(a plus for me, anyway) and the technical achievement is just awesome. In other words, you could do worse. Chow, daddy....Greg Cameron, Surrey, B.C., Canada.",Team America - World Police

The storyline and script are actually deeper and better developed than I initially expected, and the puppets, though gimmicky, are brilliantly executed and great fun. It doesn't stitch together like a conventional movie, and yes, it coasts a lot on the novelty factor, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment.It's an even-handed abuse-fest, and consistently entertaining. Not a great movie, but highly entertaining if you're happy to look past the lack of taste. Definitely recommended if you're up for it.",Team America - World Police

I was really looking forward to Team America, and it surpassed my expectations. It's totally on par with the South Park movie. It made me laugh so hard in places tears were flowing from my eyes. It doesn't matter what your politics are, as everyone gets parodied, and the moral is typical South Park-style, where they take points from both sides.Forget about not seeing it because it's puppets. They know it's cheesy. Many jokes come from the stupid-ness of using puppets. So go and enjoy!!

The ""Thunderbirds"" look is also fun, and given that I generally enjoy animation and puppetry I expected to like this movie. The problem is that the deliberately immature (schoolboy) nature of this kind of humor is always going to struggle to satisfy for an extended period :) A lot of the movie is very funny, but there are also some tediously unoriginal lengths, such as the ""this is a montage"" song, which pull the movie down.Most of the subject matter is political, and from that point of view I think right wing types would enjoy this more than lefties. If this is meant to be an ""even handed spray"" there are many obvious issues and right wing targets that are conspicuous by their absence. Those of you who rejoice in the language will enjoy the vulgar metaphor used to summarise the ""Team America war on terror"".",Team America - World Police
341,stufff11,Better than the previews would have you think,10,22 October 2004,"Team America, as some of you may have noticed from commercials, was made with marionettes (I would like to point out that when I spell checked I found that I had spelled it right all by my self). Puppets. I had several friends not go to see the movie because they thought a movie made with puppets would be horrible. I have to admit, I had my doubts, the previews didn't look all that great. But, it was made by the makers of South Park, Tray Parker and Matt Stone, who are more or less responsible for my sense of humor as it is today. To say I trust them to make me laugh would be an understatement.My trust was not betrayed. Team America made me laugh harder than any movie in recent memory. Tears rolling down my face, having difficulty catching my breath, doubled over in my seat kind of laughter. These puppets go where no puppet has gone before, and do things no puppet has never done before. I'll just leave it at that.As with most of their major motion pictures, the film features an awesome soundtrack, mostly performed by Parker and Stone's band, DVDA (100 points if you know what that stands for), with such songs as America, F**k Yeah!, which turns out to be really catchy after a while.As per usual, they don't really take any sides so much as trash everything and everyone while injecting loads of tasteless humor in every corner. The movie has lots of violence, profanity, explosions, sex, blood... and puppets. It should be seen by all.I just read somewhere that they actually had to cut a lot out because the MPAA wanted to give it an NC-17 rating. I stress that this is a puppet movie that almost got an NC-17 rating. I love these guys.",Team America - World Police
342,jirai,"Not great, but not as bad as it could have been. *Spoilers*",6,23 October 2004,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Not so much because I thought that it would be great, but because it looked decent among the myriad of junk that has been out the last few months. The other movies that Parker and Stone have done been hilarious, so I figured this would at least be a decent movie. So I went to go see it with a friend of mine.The movie itself wasn't too bad and there were even some funny parts that had me laughing out loud (the song ""America F@#$ yeah"" was my favorite part). But overall the movie was really lacking in quality, both in script and special effects (I was thinking throughout the whole movie ""This cost them $14 million""?). I really don't know if Parker and Stone were trying to make a political movie or what. They say that it was supposed to be a movie ""that makes fun of everyone"", but I didn't see them making fun of Bush or anyone in that group. Also the script was tired and predictable; guy has the power to save the world, but doesn't want to, then is brought to his senses by some woman who he's madly in love with and he ends up saving the world. There were some redeeming qualities. It was kind of funny and there were only a couple parts that seemed drawn out. The musical score was OK considering that the creators made all their own songs. Also, the idea of using marionettes is pretty cool (although even this gets old).Overall, I'd say go during a bargain showing or possibly wait to rent it. I'd give it 6/10.",Team America - World Police
343,remingtonresearch-1,Surprised,10,8 June 2005,"I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this movie. I can't get the ""Team America"" theme song out of my head and have to be careful telling people about it. The movie deserves its ""R"" rating. Indeed, the Parental Control website ""KidsinMind.com"" awards Team America the highest scores possible (which means it's really ""bad"") in it's three categories of Sex and Nudity, Violence, and Language - ever reminding you that even though the belly dancers in a middle eastern bar scene are ""wooden puppets,"" they still ""show cleavage.""It is a movie of extremes, but if you watch it in the knowledge that it contains extremely crude language and images, the comic genius will rise above and beyond that reality.It's worth watching more than once, if only for the songs that pepper the movie - pay close attention to the lyrics.I remember the marionette TV shows the sixties and it is an interesting medium in which to tell this story. Let's just say the marionettes are more ""liberated"" than their 1960's counterparts.The political extremes are also interesting. I consider myself to be moderate to liberal, but I found the lampooning of the liberal celebrities to be ""on target.""The only ""lampooning"" of the conservative right that I could see was the whole idea of America being the world's policeman, but I doubt that true conservatives, especially the religious right, would tolerate the language ""Team America"" employs to achieve its goals.So, take a chance.

344,callmeandre,Unfunny for the raging patriot and conservative,4,1 June 2015,"Because the movie is told through puppets, it will likely be off- putting for many right off the bat but it's also what made me appreciate the movie most (as a technical feat).

It's too extreme for me but was a good introspective laugh in the meantime.My rubric:2. You and I, we could make something more engrossing with a million dollars and the length of the runtime. Absolutely dreadful, a total drag - save yourself.4. Average. Post-mortem of your mildly entertained time, you are unenthused.6. The threshold for willful re-watching.

I can't remember the last time I laughed so much.Here are a few of my favorite things.... The foreign country sets and languages are done exactly as most Americans view them in their minds. Little cities made up entirely of what tourists go to see populated by people dressing and speaking exactly as someone with no clue about other cultures hears and sees.Kim and NK captured perfectly from the massive palace in the midst of squalid slums to his megalomania.The fight scenes were great. Did anyone really expect fighting puppets to look good? Of course they looked clumsy, they're puppets! Was the puking scene a little too much? Maybe by one barf. I don't know which was funnier, seeing a puppet puke or the fact that just when you expected him to make some deep statement he'd puke again.Was the puppet sex scene too raunchy? Not at all.

The fight scenes are filmed perfectly. ""Team America"" is like all the Horrible Hollywood action films. From the opening action scene where everything is blow up in sight, down to the tough guy in the force that hates all rookies.

But for every piece of humor that is funny and makes sense there is whole scenes that are not funny, make no sense at all (unless of course your American maybe), and is very offensive to certain people. There is a lot in this movie which is nothing new too recent Hollywood movies. An anti American satire film which focuses on Americas high and mighty bravado to the rest of the world like blowing the crap out of Paris and Cairo just to get a few would be terrorists, while at the same time putting in a very disturbing speech explaining why The US is right and the rest of the world is wrong when it comes to dealing with threats to world security like Kim Jong Il or terrorism. In many ways this movie is a republican parties wet dream, showing people like Alec Baldwin and Michael Moore as ignorant and retarded for supporting liberal democrats, and appear too only talk about bringing world peace in order to bolster there world popularity, which sadly is probably true in many ways.

I have got no idea why this film has a 7.2 rating as it deserves 0.0 rating in my opinion if it was possible.All this film has is non-sensical and stupid for the brain dead jokes and a stupid song track.The song track is meant to make us laugh just because there's swearing in it.come on now Trey Parker and Matt Stone, can you not use some of your creative comedy writing you use in south park. this is the worst excuse for a comedy movie ever in the history of films.I hated this movie so much, which I had such a high expectation when I bought It,but I have being trying to get rid of it since I saw it,I would rather kill myself than watch this film a second time.This is the worst thing ever.",Team America - World Police
352,it7276,It was okay...,4,24 October 2004,"First of, I am a HUGE South Park fan. Love the show, loved the movie. I even liked BASEketball, with Matt and Trey. So I had high hopes for this movie.Unfortunately, I was let down. About 50% of the jokes are just foreign puppets with ridiculous accents. I wasn't offended by it, I just expected better from Trey and Matt. Here are guys who are legitimately funny and original, and half of the jokes are a guy saying ""Dirka Dirka"" or ""I'm so Ronery."" I admit I chuckled a bit at the beginning, but it quickly got old.The other jokes were comprised mostly of puppets cursing (which prompted a laugh about half the times), an extended puking scene (which was too obvious to make me laugh), and the already-infamous sex scene, which was chuckle-worthy at times, but never laugh-out-loud funny.In my eyes, what saved the movie was the songs. And actually, just two of the songs really made me laugh. The ""America...FUCK YEAH!"" was amazing, as was the ""Pearl Harbor Sucked, and I Miss You"" song. These showed the random, original humor sytle I expected this whole movie to have. Okay, and while I'm talking about songs...they TOTALLY re-used the ""Montage"" song that they had used in an episode of South Park. Like...it could literally be (and probably is) the same exact recording of the song. It's not that I didn't like the song, but...if I'm paying money to see this, I'd kind of like to see new material, not recycled material. (Also watch for Kim Jong Il to say ""You're breaking my balls,"" which will sound recycled for viewers of South Park)Overall, I would recommend seeing this movie once...probably I would wait until it came out on DVD so you could see the footage they had to cut out from the theatrical release. Visually, this movie is very well-lit and shot, but it just really lacks in the humor department. Trey, Matt...I guess you can't crap gold all the time. Sometimes you just crap feces.

I do get the ""clever"" jokes and the countless referrals to other movies and real life situations. These jokes are the weakest parts of the movie, as far as I am concerned. These seem to be too exaggerated or not subtle enough, so they lose their edge... You can almost hear the makers shouting: ""Hey, look at us, we've seen some movies in one type of genre and we sort of copied them. Can you see it too?"" I am afraid, I already saw this in dozens of movies, like for instance ""Hot Shots,"" which, in my opinion, did pull it off. I can appreciate the fact, that it is hard to be subtle when dealing with (VERY) inanimate puppets, even more difficult than making a ""South Park"" style animation (which feature film I did like, even though it was some sort of musical). The puppets, made everything go too slow as well...I have to say, I did like the parts, which did not use ""standard"" puppetry.

All the while, Team America skillfully lampoons big-budget Bruckheimer flicks.

Most namely, the songs ""AIDS"" in the play ""Lease"" (aka ""Rent""), and ""Montage"". The best political satire was the subtle comments on how many miles it was from each continent to (""the REAL"") America. The great thing about the political commentary in the movie is that they ""shoot in all directions"". They make comments as if to say - the world really is dangerous and you liberals are fools to think that you can change that. But also clearly say that America's right is too self-centered to see the world clearly, and usually use bad intelligence to support these distorted points of views. I think that the movie all-in-all follows along the lines of others that took good ideas from television (like SNL skits) and tried to squeeze an hour and a half out of them.

This movie would have been great if it was only about 40 minutes long enough for me. One thing that really made this a great flick was the music. The extreme rhetoric was a riot, and I think the country song in the middle, which takes a stab at the Lee Greenwood song if I am not mistaken, put it all over the top.

360,offdwallnotdrack,I laughed more during Schindler's List...,1,15 May 2005,"OK, I saw Team America right when it came out because it looked like it would be a very silly but at the same time witty and clever comedy, but common...gimme a break with this junior high humor crap. I keep hearing everyone say that this is adult humor, uh, maybe if you're a retard, but I don't see how any adult can find this movie funny. This isn't adult humor, it's junior high humor with adult content, that's it, nothing more! This movie is for people who giggle when they hear the word penis. Keep in mind that I'm not a 50 year old Preacher, I'm a 22 yr. old college student and I thought Dumb and Dumber(the original) was hilarious, one of my favorite comedies ever. I love screwball comedy, but the difference between Team America and a movie like Dumb and Dumber is that Dumb and Dumber had a story that actually went somewhere, it followed a series of events to eventually arrive at a conclusion. It had people you came to care about and understand. Team America is nothing but a series of random events put together with as many jokes and dirty words as the makers could think of thrown in. Maybe if the jokes were funny I could've forgiven this, but unless you're in 7th grade and ride a skateboard and have a daily zit-popping regime, don't waste your time with this nonsense.",Team America - World Police

If you were to watch the musical Rent, you might well be led to believe that everyone living in Brooklyn in the 80s has aids or is a heroin addict. They exploit that beautifully in their mock Broadway show Lease. The dialog of the terrorists and the depiction of Kim Jong Il is hilarious, but very immature. Regardless of how silly the movie is, seeing a puppet vomit six times in three minutes and a drawn out sex scene made me lose it: uncontrollable laughter. The musical aspect to the movie also draws out laughs.

I was prepared to be bored but since I love my daughter I went along.This movie is very well made. The characters are endearing - even the villains! And the Korean-American accent is so cute, we imitated his accent long after finishing seeing the movie. The plot is straight forward and funny. The tempo is fast. The puppets and scenes appear cosy and cute. It also leveraged the fact that puppets are notoriously hard to manipulate to make you laugh. They make puppetry appear effortless and they make puppets vividly in your mind as if they are real actors. It is superbly entertaining.There is no wonder my daughter loves this movie and all the kids I know love it. What is surprising is that all the adults I know also love this movie!",Team America - World Police
363,nathanvarner,Team America: Subtley self aware.,8,2 April 2018,"Team America is a great movie that's held back from its full potential. The film comes off rushed at points and distracting for a bit, but as I thought I would find myself constantly distracted by the puppets in the movie; I found them gradually grow on me.Trey Parker and Matt Stone were able to make a movie that felt like it was shot in order, as it feels they started to understand how to use the puppets more better as the movie continues. Though a lot of the humor in here is surface level, there's a lot that's more subtle in the same way as they've been known for in South Park. It didn't feel the same however, feeling different enough to feel special and disconnected in it's own right. Out of everything Trey Parker's directed, this might well be his best. It's well shot at moments and has great use of practical effects and storytelling through subtle ideas and points that would be difficult for a live action film to accomplish. Though the movie feels rushed at times, it feels the writing could be more tight at moments like in the South Park movie. It's pretty obvious that Matt and Trey had to make lass second script improvements, and edit some stuff down to help keep the movie going along: which thankfully itsn't to distracting.This is a great movie with a lot showing for it and I highly recommend anyone whos interested in anything portrayed or connected to this movie to check it out. What's bad about the film, isn't enough to weigh it down. Give it a shot.",Team America - World Police

366,Fawlty-3,"Satire misses the mark, but the action works",7,15 November 2004,"""Team America: World Police"" has more poignant political satire in the title than in the movie itself. Parker & Stone swing in all directions, but none of their swings really hit anything. Almost any random editorial cartoon in any random newspaper on any random day gives you more political satire than this movie manages to produce. It just isn't that funny in that respect.However, the action movie spoof part of it works great, and produces plenty of laughs. It spoofs the standard elements of the Bruckheimer/Bay formula (love story, lost love, overcoming the odds, the cheesy music, the montage, and so on), while managing to be a damn fine action movie in its own right, even though (or maybe because) it's all done with marionettes. The sets are beautiful, the action scenes are carefully staged and the story would fit any Bond movie without much tweaking. Overall, solid entertainment well worth seeing, but if you're looking for engaging political satire, look elsewhere. Grade 7/10.",Team America - World Police

The only people they forgot to pillory were Barbara Streisand and Warren Beatty. And that's a shame, I'd have liked see their heads explode too. The filmmakers also make good fun of action movies in general. The movie is loaded with interludes of cheesy, relationship type dialogue that is crammed in between massive explosions and sex scenes (yes, they have sex scenes with puppets).

368,richard-1332,A truly dreadful movie,1,20 May 2006,"I saw the first five minutes, and thought that there were some good moments - parodies of all the clichés from action movies through the years, the Team America fools accidentally blowing up the Eiffel Tower in their attempt to stop terrorists, and I thought this was going to be a good film.Unfortunately, that proved to be the best bit of the movie. The only other moments I found remotely entertaining were the arrival of Kim Jong-il's ""panthers"" and the puppet sex.Beyond that, the unremitting and entirely gratuitous crudity soon became boring, and was not leavened by any more subtle ""humour"". Toilet humour has its place, but when it constitutes virtually the entirety of the script for a 90 minute film, it soon loses its appeal. The political message - that America has the right to blow up anything it chooses and that we should be grateful to them for it, while those who claim that other approaches than violence might have merit are traitors - was tiresome propaganda for Bush's policies that brooked no possibility of an alternative viewpoint. It was entirely in keeping that it was delivered via a particularly crude sexual and scatological metaphor. And after those first five minutes, the repeated - oh, so often repeated - parodies of all the action movie clichés wore very thin indeed.I would rate it as the second-worst movie I have ever seen, after 2001 - A Space Odyssey.",Team America - World Police

You know what's coming but the anticipation makes it all the more funny.Being a non-U.S. citizen also helps. Much social commentary on the vacuousness of U.S. citizens and their views (look nothing personal ...) is contained in this movie, and frankly, it's pretty funny. Yes, the astonished looks on the faces of the French and Eqyptians etc occur regularly in real life in the presence of U.S citizens.

All the while the nefarious Film Actor's Guild or F.A.G., plot to take over the world, because they have acted like they run the world so why not. The two funniest moments are, of course when Janeane Garofalo's head explodes, (because, hey, aren't we really expecting that every time she starts bellowing about some evil conservative anyway?) and the never ending spewing of vomit.

Kim Jong Il being the North Korean baddie hoping to stop the Team and rule the enite world. The gags are thick and fast and the very fact that the whole film is acted by *marionettes* is enough to keep many laughing. The best bits are undoubtedly the sex and the vomit scenes; pure genius.

373,ejross,"Like the marionettes, almost without any direction.",3,27 August 2005,"To get it off my chest, I *like* South Park. I loved the SP movie. Don't get me wrong, I ""get"" Matt and Trey's brand of humor. However, TA just couldn't do anything for me in the least. It's not funny, not especially well-written, and, worst of all, boring.I know I probably won't change any die-hard fans' minds, but I really don't see the humor in this. The plot is paper-thin at best, and there aren't a whole lot of jokes worth laughing over. Most of the ""humor"" comes from the fact that it's puppets doing all this crazy action stuff. But after the first 15 min., the novelty of that wears off and we're left with a pretty weak action-adventure comedy.The problem with doing an action-adventure with puppets is that they're not very mobile. Sure, the set piece in France *should* have been funny, but because the puppets shamble reaaaallly slowwwllly, any energy is drained out of the scene. This problem gets terrible when there's a supposed fist-fight between on TA-er (Chris?) and Sam Jackson, but I couldn't even tell what was going on. Maybe if it was a full cartoon this could have worked. Instead, it's just really really draggy.The actual plot fails as a satire, because it doesn't even know what to satirize. The liberal activists barely act like their real counterparts, and neither do the pro-war on terror characters. It's like Matt and Trey tried to make a movie and remain as ignorant as possible about what they were 'satirizing.' The constant swearing sounds like a 10 year old who just learned some dirty words. It's used almost without any real reason, aside from the fact you're supposed to find it funny that a puppet swears.

I love South Park and don't mind a few d!#k and fart jokes but the funniest aspect of the film is the fact that it replicates the lighting, music, dialogue and structure of a Michael Bay / Jerry Bruckheimer as accurately as possible and then begins to make fun of the puppet's sometimes crude movements and general limitations at the drop of a hat.Move over Monty Python.

So, late one night I joined about 40-50 other people (mostly male, mostly pretty young) in a large Manhattan theatre expecting to enjoy this movie as much as South Park and the South Park movie, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Well, turns out, this was an hour of my life lost forever. I really struggled to find something, anything, funny about it. I can certainly see where the film makers set out to offend practically every person on earth. None of it bothered me as I am not easily offended but they did a good job attacking every other ethnic, racial, or religious entity on the planet. I was sitting closer to the screen than I normally do and since the sound was a bit louder than I am normally exposed to, I couldn't tell if anyone else was laughing until I looked around. While no one was convulsing with hysterics it seemed most people thought it was funny. Well, it was lost on me.

378,Azchael,The message is missing,1,22 January 2005,"Describing Team America: World Police, I have to describe two or even three different parts: The first one considers the way of filming, which has astonished me throughout the whole movie, as the last time I've seen puppets was in the 'Augsburger Puppenkiste', a German TV show. The way how the puppets were used, the 70ties-American-white-guy-series style of design, the pictures in the background, the amazing combination of real life pictures (American monuments, the flood) and the small puppets should definitely get an award. Coming to the second part: The story of the movie, or better saying the total missing of a story. What we see is the typical young-guy-from-the-Broadway saves the world via repetition of something a drunk pal has told him before our young hero thrown up in front of a NY bar. The dialogues between the Team America members representing those of bad friendship soaps and the total ignorance of the consequences of their actions combined with a lack of real humour and unnecessary scene's and sexual hilarity's destroy the atmosphere that is far from reaching 'The incredibles' or 'Meet the feebles'. The third part involves the attitude of the movie. In the beginning you might get a negative impulse towards the Team America and it becomes clear, that the movie wants to tell something about America's attitude, but what happens to the movie to the end? America wins, the bad guys are dead and this Team America wins describing themselves as 'digs'. The statement of the movie is missing. Summarizing: Where's the message every movie wants to tell?

379,nwoodhouse,An unfunny comedy,3,7 July 2006,"I had high expectations of this film and was sadly disappointed. Using Thunderbirds-type puppets and spoofing badly written action films, using every cliché known to scriptwriters should make for an entertaining film. However, by the end I had barely chuckled a few times. I thought the script was poorly constructed, with what should have been plenty to say, ending up with just stupid, puerile jokes. Maybe its an age thing - I really didn't find this very funny. I didn't find it offensive either, just poor. Perhaps also there is a humour divide between the US and the UK. We like our satire a bit more satirical and clever and less schoolboyish. I'd like to think that the placing of Abu Simbel in Cairo was a deliberate ho-ho moment by the directors but I'm not sure. Any old Egyptian monument will do even if the real thing is about 500 miles further south. Also the Sphinx faces Cairo not out to the desert!

382,JwadeG,One of the more interesting political statements this year.,9,17 October 2004,"On the one hand, ""Team America"" was inarguably brilliant. Trey and Matt's ability to take any and all positions/belief systems/personalities and pummel them mercilessly has never been in finer form. (A film which goes right ahead and picks on liberal actors for their pacifism and shows them getting used by a murderous dictator, and then goes on to have the right wing rely on an actor to get the same result, is a film that's working on a far deeper level of satire than most are willing to admit...) Likewise, absolutely everything is done correctly so that the film works as a satire of just about everything which appears within it: it flays action films alive by using over the top gore in combination with puppets, by including a gratuitous puppet sex scene, and by showing the ""valorous army of freedom"" destroying entire cities in order to save the city from terrorists; it tears into modern politics by playing up the extremist image of both sides; it is one of the most beautiful puppet animated films ever made (while, again, satirizing puppet films with blood, sex, and vomit); and it even pokes fun at itself from the opening shot, which starts with a badly made puppet in front of a badly drawn picture of the Eiffel tower, making everyone laugh at the ""it's from the creators of crappy South Park animation"" gag.The music is wonderful, the pacing is perfect, and the jokes are very funny and gleefully un-politically correct...However, all that being said, the film does have one major flaw. By making a satire of the current situation in which the typical criticisms of each side are magnified to an astonishing degree (Liberals are shown as militantly-pacifist actors who are called pussies and f.a.g.s, and Michael Moore is actually a terrorist; while conservatives are completely oblivious to friendly fire in their militant quest to ""get the bad guy"" and flag waving nonsense like the ""Where were You"" song is parodied with a song which claims ""Freedom isn't free; freedom costs a buck o' five.""), the tendency is for it to reinforce current nitpicking and ideological stereotypes. I am amazed at how many reviews of this film on the IMDb actually claim to agree with its anti-""liberal actors"" message, while being completely oblivious to its criticism of the idea of being ""World Police."" (One of the reviewers even goes so far as to claim ""you will enjoy seeing cities like Paris getting destroyed"" while agreeing whole heartedly with the derision aimed at the liberals; missing the point entirely...)The film IS equal opportunity in its bashing, but for some reason (probably the fact that the ""hero"" is on the Team America squad, and the 'moral' of the story is ""if you don't let us f**k this a**hole, we're all going to get s**t on""), liberals and pacifists seem to come off worse. Don't get me wrong. This is NOT a right wing, flag waving, pro-Bush film... But it doesn't quite play fairly with its political satire... I would imagine that the problem here is this: since the film magnifies the currently standard insults (pacifist pussies vs militant dicks) as satire, and since it is and always has been easier to insult a pacifist than a war-monger (because pacifists will say ""yes maybe I am stupid"" and war mongers will say ""oh yeah, f**k you"" and start a brawl), and since, in an action film, the militants are going to naturally look like the ones with the right idea (because if you're already seeing blood and guts, your natural urge is to support the guys who are fighting back), then the film, by doing nothing more clever with its political satire than magnification, leans to the right simply by accident...Not to mention that the left wingers in the film are all real people (Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, etc...) and the right wingers are not. There is not a single real life conservative in the film (despite the fact that it would've been easy to satirize Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, etc...); real life conservatives are only obliquely referenced in lines and song parodies, which makes the message even easier to miss...It's a bit disturbing actually. I don't mean to say that it offended me. I can take some good natured ribbing. Especially when it's flying out in all directions. But I think that the film is actually going to be far more popular with right wingers than with those who are in the middle. I suppose what it comes down to is the old South Park paradox: how do you make a film which insults everything, and yet have an ""I learned something today ending""? In the case of most social issues, South Park succeeds with that problem by giving simple home spun advice: religious tolerance, homosexual tolerance, etc. are all good because tolerance and kindness are good... Perfectly fine. But somehow, when they make the transition to the political ideology behind warfare, and then do it in a puppet based action film, the ""moral of the story"" starts to sound much more sinister...I don't really know what to say. I liked it, but the more I think about it, the more its message worries me. I have to wonder if it's not, in fact, dangerous waters for Matt and Trey to wander into... Is there really anyone who is capable of being objectively cynical about all politics? Or do Matt and Trey let their own beliefs show through in the choices they make?Highly recommended. But I do say that with a great deal of caution. Watch it with a critical eye. Because its political ideology is very difficult to fully grasp... (Claiming to thrash everyone equally yet still choosing a side...) And it's actually a great deal of fun to try to find Matt and Trey's own politics buried in a film which tries to oppose all politics...One way or the other, this is one of the most thought provoking political statements one will see in a theater all year.",Team America - World Police

There are a couple of standout moments but I think a person could take a leak, make some popcorn and take a phone call and still get the gist. As much as Parker and Stone jab at self-indulgent Hollywood stars, they really should have tightened their own belts in terms of editing. Of course the puppets are impressive and the created sets were really interesting. At some point though, who cares?

But watching outside of the assumptions many Americans take as gospel, turned a good idea (a comedy involving puppets) into a political rant lacking in both satire and innovative humour. As a fan of South Park, and a fan of South Park the Movie, I was expecting something much more intelligent and coherent. Instead, this movie delivers a surprisingly conservative rendition of world events, devoid of satirical weight.Here's how the satire works: Team America are good guys with excessive force. The Film Actor's Guild (a crudely homophobic acronym) are corruptible Americans. The terrorists (a crude mixture of Russians, Arabs, and North Koreans) are unquestionably bad. The satire emerges in the excessive force used by Team America (as we've all heard), but this side of things dies down very quickly, after the first few scenes. The real thrust of the satire is against left-wing actors who speak out against American violence. In contrast to the violence itself, the film depicts their weakness as both unpardonable and ultimately treasonous. In contrast, the threat by the terrorists is given as real in the movie, and Team America presented as justified, warts and all.Parker may be exaggerating his vitriol against the left-wing actor sector (think Rock the Vote style celebs), but the movie offers very little in the way of real satire. There are satirical moments, but the values of the film remain consistent with the images and narrative shown (satire depends on the opposite). The movie does ridicule left-wing actors, but it doesn't hide its ridicule -- the ridicule is the very point of the film. At the same time, the criticism against George Bush style violence is excused by the fact that the terrorists are accepted and given as real threats to America. People may accept this as gospel in the US, but outside it appears delusional and paranoiac.I was trying to think up a way this movie could have presented a genuine satire, and the best is to turn to the classics: Don Quixote, in particular. In Cervantes' masterpiece, the over-eager Quixote embraces the Romantic ideals of the day and sets about defending them. The problem is that, much like Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, the boogey-men and monsters he confronts are all false illusions. Nobody is trying to overthrow Romantic values because Romantic values don't exist in the world. In a similar way, to return to the context of the movie, nobody is really trying to overthrow American values because American values don't exist in any tangible, fixed way. To paraphrase Mackenzie King, the truth is that Americans have always accepted 'Freedom if necessary, but not necessarily freedom.' Parker includes many satirical gestures in this direction -- mocking the empty rhetoric of politicos. How many times can one person say ""Freedom!"" before asking what that really means, how is it defined, comprised, and safe-guarded in a nebulous world-in-flux? The film makes a few of this type of criticism but ultimately pardons them as the ugly surface muddying (by over-simplifying) the real issue of concern: the defense of America. But when these vacuous terms are used to justify terribly questionable actions, the implications of so lightly critiquing their use amounts to a tacit approval of the actions if not the language used.To summarize: liberals appear naive and corruptible (they end up working for the terrorists), terrorists appear violent and evil, and conservatives appear awkward, over-aggressive but justified. The message and the image are the same in the film: it is not satire. Worse, still, it appears perfectly on message with White House personnel.What happened to South Park? All I saw was a barely veiled critique of those who DARE criticize America. You'd think they were exercising their freedom or something. The nerve....",Team America - World Police
387,Soom,Unexpected disappointment,3,3 February 2005,"Despite such a brilliant job of the artists, who created the environments and the puppets, the movie itself is a total disappointment.First - everybody should know, that it's NOT animation - it's a puppet movie filmed live. Due to that - the artistic performance of the puppets is so low and limited, that in the long scenes they become totally boring, with the indifferent glass look, no expression on the face and very limited movement.The puppets themselves are not stylized at all and miss the point of using puppets in a movie at all! The whole idea of creating puppets, is that they are not what we are in the real life! Think of South Park - the whole charm of the characters is that they are so stylized that they don't look realistic and at the same time so alive and funny! Or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" - brilliant puppet animation with such great characters!It was surprise to me, that the creators of South Park could make such a bad movie! South Park is totally the opposite, of what Team America is about.The humor is boring and not inventive, the scenario is totally slow, boring and stupid, and too straight to be ironically and surrealistically stupid, as it is in South Park - Hollywood has produced hundreds of stupid comedies equal to this one. The ""Hot Shots"" movie - a perfect example - it has the same elements as Team America and yet - it's much better.I think, that the directors could achieve better results, if they were making animation instead of live action puppets. Probably their directing experience while making South Park was not enough to create live action movie with marionettes that cannot act!",Team America - World Police

You're a butt****** quitter!"" Or ""Jesus tit****** Christ!"" The final speech given by Gary, I think, sums up the ideology of the filmmakers. The US may be reckless, arrogant dicks but they're far preferable to the people we fight.

The slams, the storyline, the graphics were great. There was some serious overtime put into this work. The sex scene was a bit long though but it allowed me some time to put more beer in the fridge. This movie blasts everyone at a time when everyone should have gotten blasted. It also points out some of the ineptness of the American policy of being the worlds police. It's worth viewing just for the Kim Jung Il scene with Hans Brix. The addition was priceless and I just about fell out of my chair. Some people might get offended but I believe that was part of the point being made. We're too busy being politically correct to even be able to laugh at ourselves or to even recognize a threat. I know this got held down because many phonies thought it wasn't PC enough and it would hurt some feelings. Well too bad...

In terms of political humor, strangely the only people NOT offended (nor even mentioned) are either from the Whitehouse or from the presidential contender's party. As a satirical social commentary, it is a wonderfully insightful look into how the important current issues and pundits of the day are spun into a high-chaos distortion. But the manner of the distortion accurately depicts how each side views their opponents. The film doesn't seem to take sides, but does pull in all of the key players: Islamic facists terrorists, Kim Jong Il (North Korea's dictator), Hanz Blix (the U.N. weapons inspector), and a host of politically motivated Hollywood celebrities. On the real issues, I may lean one side or the other.

This is the kind of movie that reveals and celebrates where our Hollywood culture is today. It is high on visual effects, low on everything else. As is often the case now, it seems that the writers are pandering to the 13-year-old crowd, even though the film carries an R rating. I mean, really, how many dick, pussy, asshole, vomiting references are needed to make a point? Are these guys aware of the concept of subtle? I get the impression that the writers are locked in some adolescent stage where any sexual reference makes them giggle, and for whom to have the power to put their vulgar take on things on the screen must be orgasmic. In short, the film has interesting and clever visuals but no class. But then, that's pretty much how things are today, in film and elsewhere. Don't bother seeing it.",Team America - World Police

Team America uses excessive force to destroy the pyramides while chasing terrorists, they destroy the Eiffel tower and other historic landscapes of Paris, all in the name of the war on terrorism. That should give you a hint.The hollywood actors are literally puppets of Kim Jong Il, who uses them as a distraction of his plan to deploy WMDs all over the world and bringing chaos to the world. It's quite notably how present those Weapons are in this movie, hinting to the fact that George Double Bush found - none, although that was the whole premise of his war on Iraq.It goes the same way as every American action movie about this theme, with the hero of the story having a huge setback, only to come back stronger and better than ever before. And of course the American ""patriots"" win their just fight in the end. That's the f*ing joke. That's the whole parody: America always wins in this movies, and critique of America gets a bullet to the head.To actually think that Parker&Stone themselves believe the nonsense they're parodying is really insane.",Team America - World Police

The way the story and the songs are. They are so intelligent. Do Not take your kids to see this movie. It's not a kid movie.It's for adults and they use some strong adult subject matter such as terrorism and porn. Yes there is a puppet porn scene in the movie.

And if you found this movie offensive, then you had no reason to see it other than to complain about it because you have too much time on your hands. Half of what makes this movie hilarious is because of how terrible the quality of it is. The way the puppet's mouths move half a second after the words are being said. There's a scene after the infamous sex scene where the girl shushes Gary and pokes her finger in his eye. That part made me laugh hystarically. But hey.

Hans Blix (of the U.N.) is a totally bureaucratic nerd, who has no idea of what he is doing. Michael Moore is reduced for Hot Dogs and an American version of the Jihad and then you think about the caveman's philosophy message of hards, pussys and assholes and you get to the conclusion that Top Gun, Armageddon, Independence Day etc. are really good movies with a lot of moral inside. The message of ""American Heroes"" is really embarrassing for civilized nations. And where is Mr.Bush and his party ? Not worth to be mentioned ?

Expect a lot of celebrities, especially Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, and Susan Sarandon to be angry because these guys did such a good job making fun of them. I especially enjoyed how the movie pokes fun of both sides of the political spectrum equally, instead of showing the typical political movies that are anti-conservative.

Team America turned out to be an absolute cracker.The marionettes looked top-class and the effort put into the sets paid off. The send-up of another (unnamed) 'world police' and their bludgeoning techniques was sharp enough to sting yet tasteful enough not to offend (much).I enjoy simple humour such as this. 'The signal' left me on the floor in stitches. Special effects were delightful - gore levels were just about right.Team America could have done with a few less profanities but I wouldn't be too bothered.

The theater was perfect because it's not one those mainstream ones, and it wasn't overly crowded with people.I went in, watched, and came out. During the watching time I had many a good laugh. To me this was a great film from beginning to end. Definitely one those films you'll always remember. Sure there was a lot of vulgarity in the movie, something I don't hear all the time, but it fit in well. The script was well written, and I have commend the writers on doing some great writing. There were plots, and plenty of character development throughout the film. It's been a long time since I laughed and enjoyed a movie of this caliber.

407,sportsguybri10,"America, F@#! Yeah.",10,13 October 2004,"Starting out Team America you will see just about the only CGI in the whole movie. And that's only the opening titles. As you may know, the movie opens with a scene of a sh*tty puppet moving in front of a sh*tty background, but then opens up to a bigger and better puppet controlling that one. All seems well until terrorists invade Paris, and gunfire runs rampant. Team America 'saves the day', unfortunately after a tragedy within the Team. This all happens within 10 minutes, might I add. Next we hear our first taste of the great music in Team America, and it definitely adds to the awesomeness of the movie. 'America, F*ck Yeah' from DVDA is simply amazing. The timing of this song adds so much to the mood of the scenes it takes place in, it's just great. The music makes the film. Despite this, the action scenes add tremendously to the film. So many explosions and fighting, it's crazy. I don't know where puppet sex fits in, but let me tell you this: the final version is very graphic. I can't imagine how much more graphic the deleted parts were. Celebrities also have a huge part in the film, as they are the basis of several jokes (not majority), and crucial to the plot. Speaking of plot, Team America actually follows a very clever and hilarious plot, which you may not expect. The characters, especially Gary, develop quite nicely. The ending is a bit weird, but hey, it's from Matt and Trey. In the end, it all comes down to d*cks, p*ssies, and *ssholes. Overall, Team America: World Police provides well over an hour of laughs, explosions, celebrities, music, quotes, cheesy catchphrases, curse words old and new, and proves an important point. (Think about the title for a second.) This film certainly has INTELLIGENCE. I give TA:WP 5/5 stars. How could I not? Matt and Trey worked so hard on this movie, and it shows.

However, once they have actually been forced to watch the film, they're believers. I convinced my film class teacher to show this movie (and she was VERY reluctant to) to a class of kids who really didn't want to see it. When they walked out it was like a revelation for them.It's a true cinematic accomplishment, the cinematography is amazing and just like a Bruckheimer film, which is what Parker was trying to do. All of the sets were built on a sound stage, most while filming was actually going on 20 feet away. Everything was built on a one-third scale in comparison to an average human, so many small gags and in-jokes are in there for the viewer to look for, i.e. an American quarter as a belt buckle for the Team America belt.The inclusion of real, well-known figures in American culture as puppets was also a very ingenious concept. Making appearances are the likes of Alec Baldwin, George Clooney, Samuel L. Jackson, Liv Tyler, Matt Damon, Susan Sarandon, and Janeane Garofalo. These are all of the Hollywood actors who feel they have to put their two cents in on world issues like someone cares about what they have to say.""Tean America"" deals with strong issues in today's American society in a satirical light. In a post-9/11 America, everyone is afraid to discuss terrorism or world events, much less make fun of it. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il is portrayed as a foul-mouthed, egocentric Asian, and the Americans are the self-righteous defenders of freedom. The Team Americans invite themselves into world affairs that do not concern them, much like the real America, and usually make things worse.In summation, this is the funniest movie I have ever seen.

But that isn't the subject, so I go to the point: I really liked the songs in the movie (America, F**K yeah!, The song about ""Pearl Harbor"", etc.) and the way that the directors told us, that the Americans catching the terrorist make more damage, then the terrorist would do.

Another point worth noting is how effectively Parker and Stone mock the American government and its foreign relations in this hilarious satire. Okay, now this movie is hilarious, and anyone who enjoyed South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut will enjoy it. Even if you didn't, you'll still bellow with laughter. Much like South Park, Team America has musical moments which add humour with the lyrics. From 'Only A Woman' to 'I'm So Ronery' to a cantina song similar to that in Star Wars, the songs are as funny as the rest of the movie. So the soundtrack is definitely much better than your average soundtrack.

414,gofenris,Trey and Matt....,10,19 July 2005,"What can be said about this movie that hasn't been already... It's funny, it's irreverent and it's just plain silly. What isn't obvious is that while trashing Michael Bay films and paying homage (and parodying Gerry Anderson), Trey Parker has made a ""Bayesque"" film that is better than any of Michael Bays attempts up until this point. The Cinematographer Bill Pope (His resume' should speak for itself) makes this movie gorgeous to watch, even with the sound turned off, and has one of the greatest (and possibly longest) ""pull-back"" shots in movie history. Trey Parker's songs are (as always) simply hilarious. The composer Henry Gregson-Williams (another person in which his resume' should speak for itself) is in fine form as his soundtrack is worthy of note to classical music fans. The Chiodo Brothers (I think this is their official handle) are phenomenal puppet builders and I've read that the first attempt with the puppets was toned down by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for being too life like. The Chiodos and their puppeteers did a fantastic job with the emotions of these puppets and while in some scenes the puppets (and their inherent goofiness) is played for laughs, other scenes it's easy to forget they are on strings. I've seen this film 6 or 7 times now and every time I find something else to appreciate. Oddly, what at first seemed a goofy little movie too me, is quickly becoming one of my favorite and reminds me why I started watching movies in the first place. This film encompasses what movie making is... A great director (whether intentional or not), a great cast (although most of it is two guys), fantastic crew with a lot of heart and soul. Which is impressive considering it pretty much trashes the ""popular American ideal and attitude"" on many levels and along with many other things. If for no other reason, Trey Parker should be applauded for assembling is supporting crew for this film.

His hatred of Hollywood is white hot. I haven't seen such an angry & preachy film in some time. My friends (who rented it) begged me to turn it off 20 minutes into it. Despite seeing it for free, I pressed on & finished it. I kept wondering why Trey Parker was so angry & more than that,who the hell the target audience was supposed to be. Teenagers would be turned off by the Thunderbirds puppet thing. Older audiences would be either bored and/or offended. I didn't expect ANYTHING out of this movie except for moderate entertainment. It failed. It reminded me why I stopped watching South Park long ago. I don't blame Matt Stone for this because it is Trey Parker's name that is slathered on this film. Seeing as this made 32 million US (50 million world wide) & cost 32 million to make, I would be surprised to see Trey get another movie deal any time soon. Plus, he REALLY POed off a lot of people with this thing.",Team America - World Police

The movie in itself was pretty good, didn't like the storyline but hey its just about the same as South Park. First the reality aspect. As a person who has studied military aircraft my whole life I can say they did a pretty good model of the equipment used however if you have a guy who cant fire a missile worth crap then I wouldn't want him in my group. Next the sex scene...and I will leave it at that. And then the bar scene. How can someone who is drunk and in a bar remember the speech about the three types of people, go out into a back alley, vomit, pass out in that vomit and then remember it how many days later, I have no idea but it was funny anyway.",Team America - World Police

Puppet sex (rim job), the bloodbath deaths of Hollywood stars, Kim Jong Il and his expletives minus the 'L's. The house cat cougars, Gary and the Washington monuments backdrop, the limousine Murcielago. The incredibly bad facial reconstruction, the bar scene with nod to Star Wars, the Obi Wan Kenobi mind trick moment, Gary's vomit scene. It's all pretty freakin' funny.

The reason I rented the DVD, in the first place, was because I thought that it would be a funny satire of U.S./World relations. For me to watch it again, it would have to be the only alternative to what Gary did to Spottswoode to show his dedication.

It's a shame that so many people worked so hard to make this movie work from a technical perspective only to have it let down by the sophomoric writing. My teenage son can write better material then this. How long could it have taken to write this movie? A weekend would have been generous.This movie could have been so much funnier and wittier had the writers spent the extra dime. Instead of insipid, tired Southparkish clichés they could have raised the bar with more intelligent commentary on how America is perceived and how they feel about the ""Hollywood pacifists."" I mean come on... Kim Jong Il was Southpark's Kenny with an insulting Asian accent. I was so disappointed to see this movie even brought in +$32mm at the box office. At $10 per head, that's around 320k people that shelled out to see this piece of tripe.Fortunately I didn't have to pay to see this DVD but I'm insisting my sister who loaned it to me return it for her money back.Johnny Smoke",Team America - World Police

And no Journey psyche outs.The humor is just as irreverent as usual and they did not leave out one action movie cliché, which are so prevalent in those insipid Michael Bay movies. It's obvious Mssrs.

First off, who decided that doing puppets was a good idea, or even remotely entertaining. Second, the movie is absolutely pointless. I was told this one was funny, but it wasn't even close. I was half way through it, and I still haven't even smiled at any of the nonsense that I had to endure. It's also filled with stupid stereotypes that have no purpose, since again, they are not funny. A good comedy author must be clever, first of all, touch on something close to reality, and put a funny spin on it. The author of this movie seem nothing like that. It is possible that they are just simple minded, high school drop outs, or even retarded; your guess is as good as mine. Caution, the movie can be offensive at times too. It is offensive really to many people. The ignorant authors seem like they are depicting their random thoughts/views in this movie, while attacking anyone who opposes their stupid views. It is just arrogant, and completely uncivilized. Democracy is at risk if this continues to be the modus operandi for dialog in America. I think this movie is a total waste of time and money.

Watching this movie will give anyone a new appreciation for the countless hours that go into making a film, from the lyrics and engineering of the soundtrack, to the absolutely hysterical facial expressions I never knew that a marionette could produce. This is the kind of movie that you should watch at least twice. It'll give you a chance to catch all of the clever little tidbits of funny in the background as well as in the foreground. Pay special attention to any and ALL song lyrics because hearing them once is funny, but downloading them and having them at your permanent disposal is invaluable for anyone that appreciates good toilet humor. This movie keeps you laughing from the first minute (I've never known I was going to love a movie faster than this) to the closing credits. Parents: This movie is NOT for small children. It contains extreme violence, language, and nudity (albeit with puppets) that will offend anyone that is either under 13 or takes everything too seriously.

All these bad reviews bummed me out because I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and I almost let this movie pass me by. Luckily, I saw another movie in the same theater, so I sneaked in and caught the first twenty minutes of Team America. It is hilarious. I had to relieve a babysitter, otherwise I would have stayed for the whole thing. I returned two days later and watched it all the way through.

It's just that, this movie is spectacularly un-funny, pretty much 98% of the time.It uses crude toilet humour and bad language to ""South Park"" it's way to popularity, which much to my annoyance, seems to have had the desired effect on it's benign fans.The way the puppets move around and the zoom ins on cheesy expressions and set pieces is just not clever. It's tired old hat. You don't have to look far these days to see witty parodies of America and US foreign policy. This film lends nothing to the current fever sweeping the western world of sending up the States as a nation gripped by patriotism and militarism.It's basically, a similar sort of film to 'Ali G in da House', except whereas the aforementioned film was tedious, gum shoe, brain deadening rubbish, at least it had parts that were so ridiculous that it raised a smile.

This is one of the funniest and obscene movies I have ever seen. I have never been to a movie where the dialog was constantly being drowned out by the laughter of the audience. Trey Parker helms as director with Matt Stone along for the ride as co-writer and voice contributor. The political satire involves everything from Kim Jong Il of North Korea to Osama Bin Laden's attempt to blow up Paris. If you can stand the humor of South Park you'll thoroughly enjoy Team America.

434,Qutmaster,Best movie ever made,10,30 December 2009,I've seen this movie maybe 50 times. There's no doubt that Trey Parker and Matt Stone is the greatest comedian this side of the birth of Christ. Making a movie with dolls instead of real actors since they think all actors are unsympathetic idiots with too big egos is brilliant. Then taking the best photographer and special effect-guy Hollywood can offer and blow all the budget on this is the right way to go. But even though this is great the script is the best part in this deal. Throwing away clichés of all the crappy dialogue that Michael Bay is responsible for and making them good is a mission impossible that Trey and Matt make possible.Don't miss the bonus material on the DVD!

Trey Parker shows his poor political perspectives in this half funny, half boring film. A shame, in my opinion. He tries to make a political statement with a childish simplistic analogy that explains nothing but his scarcity of ideas. You might want to see it, if you get in for free.

442,sueg-1,It's the details that make this a must-see ...,8,10 October 2004,"**Warning, contains spoilers**To paraphrase a rousing speech given by TA:WP's reluctant hero, Broadway actor Gary Johnston, America may be a big jerk, but sometimes a jerk is what you need to get the job done.This movie, a tangential expedition into marionette-world by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, has many of the hallmarks of their other work: equal-opportunity mockery of American military might, Jerry Bruckheimer films, self-important Hollywood types and Kim Jong-Il; fellatio jokes; barf (you've never seen a puppet hurl like this, I guarantee you); badly impersonated celebrity voices and a deceptively clever soundtrack.It's funny, if you like this kind of humor (and I do), but what I found even more enjoyable was the interaction between the puppets themselves and the real world: they are incinerated, lit on fire, eaten by realistic-looking sharks, washed away in floods and even menaced by cats, and Gary appears, Flat-Stanley-like, in front of the Vietnam Memorial, the Washington Monument and Mount Rushmore, to name a few (the latter serves as Team America's headquarters).I also loved the detailed sets, particularly Kim Jong-Il's palace, complete with statuary, cloisonne vases and a piano bedecked with photos of 40's starlets. Early in the movie we are treated to elaborate scenes set in Paris and Cairo, followed by little vignettes taking place in New York City (where Gary appears in ""Lease, the Musical""), Panama, India and England, to name a few; this attention to detail is a nice change of pace from South Park's minimalist style of animation.And then there are the puppets themselves. At times, especially in closeup, you almost forget they aren't real people, then the camera pans back a tad and you see them lurching in that telltale stringy marionette way; there are some hilarious martial-arts battles between puppets which must have been murder on their operators. Arguably the funniest (and/or most unsettling) part of the movie is a lengthy sex scene between Gary and his love interest Lisa; it's amazing how graphic the action between two anatomically-incorrect puppets can be. This, combined with frequent fellatio references and liberal use of the F word, made me glad I left my fourteen-year-old at home.Overall, this was a movie I enjoyed despite its heavy-handed message. It's a brilliant send-up of the usual save-the-world blockbuster summer flicks, and both pokes fun at and grudgingly admires the American tendency to shoot first and ask questions later (the Eiffel Tower, the Arc du Triomphe and the Louvre are all blown to bits in the quest to stop four scruffy terrorists, for example), but the background details and musical numbers (including the Montage Song, which I remember from a South Park episode) are what really made it worth my $6.25.",Team America - World Police

I wouldn't say this is a pro-war movie. But it is definitely an anti-anti-war movie. Although some may disagree.The hawkish undertones of the movie kept me from fully enjoying it. Although perhaps viewers would be well advised to leave any sensitivity at home, you won't need it.With all the chatter about Parker and Stone having to trim the love scene to get the R rating, I have no idea what could possibly have been left out.

Team America is far from children's television, it's easy to understand why someone might interpret the rubber faced puppets as children's entertainment and if you were to consider the South Park cartoons suitable then you might think again after seeing this. This film really stands out due to the audience it has been targeted towards, I have no doubt the multiplex's will be full of young and adolescent males and females and rightly so. Some particularly funny one liners made this film a joy to watch and as the characters animate themselves on screen credit has to go to the excellent voices provided by Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Kristen Miller among others, a particular favorite character of mine was the Matt Damon puppet. My main quarrel with this film involved the vulgarity to which the film extends itself there are a number of scenes that were perhaps a little unnecessary, like the hero returning to undergo a rather unpleasant sexual act at this point you begin to notice large gaps in the script. It's clear though that the indication of sex between two puppets is ridiculous and the film makers have levied this to their advantage creatively and to very funny effect. My last gripe with the picture is the egotistical story, some of the jokes simply aren't funny because they are directed at the US audience, though in fairness the odd poke at the character floors and the teams demise do make up for this.

The whole time I found myself laughing so hard, hard enough to where tears would come out of my eyes, and I'm not an easily amused person. With the touch of having puppets instead of actors made the movie itself also. I would have to say this is Matt and Treys best work, one of the MOST funniest movies, and I'm thinking that it might be THE funniest movie ever made.",Team America - World Police
447,prohibited-name-2088,GREATEST MOVIE OF THIS OR ANY TIME.,10,9 October 2004,"I saw the sneak preview today and let me say, everyone will love this movie (except Kim Jong Il of course). If you were thinking of maybe seeing it I say you should see it. This movie is so ****ing hilarious. The songs, the dialogue, the whole movie is so funny that it literally hurts. And nobody escapes from the comedy either, well the audience does. Sometimes the puppets look fake and do something stupid which will have you choking with laughter while other times the puppets look like real people do realistic stunts. The voice acting is superb. There is one drawback to the movie. There's so many funny parts you can't even remember anything. It's like being date raped by comedy!I give it infinity out of five stars",Team America - World Police
448,animusrex2000,Brilliant,8,10 October 2004,"Just saw this movie tonight at a sneak preview at universal city. it was a pretty big crowd and everybody seemed to love it. not going to give any spoilers away, but it might help to say that this movie does a good job at offending in a generalized way, not partisan or politically. It was a little odd that only a few weeks before the election this movie comes out, and it seems to deliberately NOT take any sort of political stance. They succeed in making a ridiculous fool out of michael moore and completely shame and disgrace a number of movie stars, but it seemed like they did it just to do it- in the same vain as ridiculing wynona ryder in the south park movie. The movie was brilliant and I believe it refrained from making any sort of political statement that would be transitory and fleeting, as the movie should stand on its own and will be timeless,like the south park movie. I can imagine seeing this in a theater of republicans or democrats, and it wouldn't make a big difference so long as they have a sense of humor and can handle a good d*&k joke.",Team America - World Police
449,mberie,Ebert is awful.,9,21 October 2004,"I saw this movie last night and I laughed for a long time, in fact I still chuckle now just thinking about it. I have been a Trey and Matt fan since the first episode of South Park, and probably will be until they or I die.When the movie was over, I came home and started reading other people reviews, and that's when it hit me that people don't get this movie, one most notably was Ebert (who gave it a 1 of 5 stars.)I'm not going to say this movie was a ten out of ten, but it was close. Yes, it will offend people, yes, it offended Sean Penn but there is much more to this movie then simply fart jokes.This movie successfully combines the action genre, puppetry, current events, fart jokes and Hollywood film making, into one cohesive self ridiculing reflexsive movie. It's the combination of all of the above that really makes this movie. All of Trey's and Matt's strenght lies in their ability to take a tired genre or plot, [i.e. a family sitcom (""That's My Bush""), a western musical (""Cannibal: the Musical""), an afterschool special (""South Park""), a coming of age story (""Orgazmo""), or an underdog sports story (""BASEketball"")], and give it new life. They make fun of genre through adding usual situations or ideas (life two people doing a wild porno scene instead of the usual slow lovemaking scene) and then giving it one extra twist (making puppets have a porno scene). It has been criticized for having no particular political stance, neither did the satire writing of Swift, they both just try to push the issues into the limelight by suggesting absurd and extreme solutions.End of the ramble. 9 of 10 for a involving plot, good puppetry, cinematography and making me laugh more then enough for my 4.50 ticket price (I love Wisconsin, at least as much as that is possible).",Team America - World Police
450,enochjs,Team America: Policing Jerry Bruckheimer,9,21 October 2004,"By Joe Enoch Managing EditorYou know when you've been laughing so much the muscles around your dimples hurt? Yeah, that should be called Team America-itis because that movie is a major cause for the condition and the only cure is to not see ""Team America: World Police.""Within two minutes, this near-perfect (because nothing's perfect) comedy will have the viewer hooting with laughter. The creators and voices of Comedy Central's, ""South Park,"" Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have made a brilliant film  and all with marionette. The film opens in Paris, France and ends with laughter that stays with the viewer hours, even days after the closing credits.Team America, is a naïve group of four individuals (puppets) who are hired by the United States to destroy all the, vaguely referred to, 'weapons of mass destruction.' This team is set on making the world a peaceful place by blowing up all the, once again, vaguely referred to 'terrorists' (puppets). In doing so a few of their missiles and bullets stray from their targets, bringing down civilians, the Eiffel Tower and pyramids in Egypt, to name a few. In one scene, a 'terrorist' runs into the Louvre for shelter. Not even a famous museum could protect him though as a missile flies down the glass pyramid at the museum's center and blows the whole structure to pieces.This movie comes across as political film, making fun of both sides. However, the truth is, this film is a satire of every Jerry Bruckheimer film ever created. Jerry Bruckheimer is the director and producer of such big budget embarrassments as ""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" In one scene, while the main character, Gary, does soul-searching (very Jerry), there is a 'love' song which really is less about love and more about how bad ""Pearl Harbor"" and Ben Affleck are.The song goes: 'I miss you more than that movie missed the point. And that's an awful lot girl I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school. He was terrible in that film I guess Pearl Harbor sucked just a little bit more, than I miss you.'In an interview with Rolling Stone, Stone said, 'That's what really guided us. You know those 'What would Jesus do?' bracelets? We wanted 'What would Jerry do?' bracelets. And the answer is, he would blow things up.'Everything in the movie is exactly how Jerry Bruckheimer would do it. For example, dramatic music, unrelated love scenes mid-movie self-examinations by the main character are an exact replication of a Michael Bay explosa-thon.The film's main target is Jerry Bruckheimer. However, it takes jabs at almost everyone, including Michael Moore who breaks into Team America's lair in Mt. Rushmore and in a terrorist-esque performance, blows up himself and their base including their computer, I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.The film, like ""South Park,"" has an abrupt absurdity inducing laughter from all the viewers. Although not true to any political agenda, a one minute puke scene and a ludicrously obscene puppet-sex scene highlights the extremely twisted comedy of this film. Aside from the humor, the film is a technological anomaly. The creators conceived of the film after watching the 1964 cult favorite and all marionette film, ""Thunderbirds."" 'It would be so fun to do a shitty little puppet movie,' said Parker.However, the high-quality puppets and unbelievably detailed sets proved to be quite expensive and very laborious. ""Team America"" finished just days before its Oct. 15 release date and cost $32 million.""Team America"" is one of my top five comedy films. It ranks with ""The Search for the Holy Grail,"" ""What About Bob?,"" ""The Jerk"" and ""Office Space."" Team America: World Police is a must see. I mean it, DO NOT MISS IT. Any politically charged student, demented fool, ""Thunderbirds"" fan and person who thinks the explosions in ""Pearl Harbor"" were cool, should see this film.",Team America - World Police

The way the puppets move is enough to make you wet your pants laughing! This film is hilarious. The boys from South Park really know how to make the public laugh. I think this film is targeted at non-Americans, although I can't imagine most Americans not laughing either. They poke fun not only at the US war-mongers but also at the lefties including several well known actors and activists. And of course, who could forget the main evil-doer of this film, the lovable Kim Il Jung... his ""I'm so ronery"" song is one of the most memorable scenes. They did an outstanding job with the puppets, and the soundtrack is hilariously entertaining. A must see for anyone who wants to laugh and leave with a smile. 10/10!",Team America - World Police

But I do love Team America. I like the ""Thunderbirds"" like look and the humor! All music tracks in the movie are terribly funny! The best song is ""I miss you and Perl Harbour sucks""! ""Montage"" is also very funny! It's great that the German version includes the songs in English because otherwise it would make no sense I think! And I will never forget the ""puking scene""! I've watched it several times and every time i lay on the ground laughing! The ""Barbie and Ken"" like sex scene is funny in different dimensions! The look, the positions and the fact that in no movie with real actors this would have happened in the United States! :) What I din't understand was the Michael Moore self bombing sequence! Does Parker and Stone like him or not!? I remember one of them talking in""Bowling for Columbine""!? Maybe it's sarcastic...The oral sex scene between Gary and Spottswoode is a little bit weird! :X And it's a bit to hard for my opinion to show Kim Jong Il as a roach...It's one of the funniest films I've seen in my whole life!

Trey and Matt are without a doubt the most powerful men in comedy.

This bears the standard of a great film by expressing the ironies innate in every argument in this quasi-political tale; from socialist Michael Moore, fashionably charitable celebrities to the terrorists and the, ahem ""world police."" This couldn't be more accurately summed up than in one of the funniest ever analogies that is employed in this film; the ""Dic*s, P*ssies, and a*s*holes, argument."" This film also wonderfully parodies the standard conventions and cliché's of the action film genre to create an entertaining, and gleefully controversial film.",Team America - World Police
455,spazzadder,Team America OK,7,20 January 2005,"There are a lot of laughs to be had in this film. The songs are awesome, and the effects are decently done. The biggest laughs in it are actually the scenes that have nothing to do with politics, but the senseless violence and throwing-up jokes, speech impediment jokes, as well as the *greatest speech in the history of cinema* (Given twice, so you can all join in on the second time!)Having the characters as marionettes is a good metaphor, in that we are all being controlled by stupidity. There is even a Matrix joke that would be hideously outdated (like in Kung Pow), but in this context is actually a very funny jab at the Special Effects Industry. Another great spoof is of Godzilla Vs. Gigan (after Kim Jong Il's death). And when the main character finally sucks it just makes for a good, cheap laugh.But cheap humor is all there is to this movie.There is no concrete message to it. Parker & Stone seem to shy away from taking sides, and their ultimate goal is to apparently ""offend everybody"". However, it's actually a pretty tame movie (by my standards, anyway...I've seen plenty stuff more shocking than this). Maybe if it were real flesh-and-blood people attached to strings it would be different...but that would just be weird, wouldn't it?Making fun of everyone's beliefs is the goal here, but their argument against the Left is pretty tame. So what if they kill off the annoying, insignificant celebrities? They could have presented a better satire if they killed off more powerful people (like certain high-ranking US politicians) or done something else more blasphemous than just knocking Alec Baldwin (didn't he already die in the South Park Movie anyway?). Not that I don't like seeing Alec Baldwin killed, I'd just prefer that it wouldn't be a puppet or a cut out character resembling him when it happened.Adding to the problem is the movie rating. Why on earth did they cut the sex scene to avoid an NC-17?! Stuff like that really refutes their 'edge' and makes them seem a little hypocritical when they clamour about their pride in risk-taking.All-in-all, I liked the movie, but felt that I really only needed to see it once.Incidentally, Roger Ebert really hated this movie. So that in itself is a good reason to see it!!(**1/2 out of ****)",Team America - World Police
456,liamt-2,Genius,9,30 May 2005,"I went to see Team America: World Police feeling a certain amount of apprehension, as I had not been the biggest fan of the Southpark series. I confess that I didn't watch it with any regularity but the episodes I had been unfortunate to see were extremely crude and not very funny. I was expecting Team America to be something along the lines of a feature length episode of Southpark, and so my expectations were not all that high.I could not have been more wrong. Team America is a comic masterpiece. Sure, it contains all the crudeness and shock factor which characterised the main appeal of Southpark. However, it is mixed in with scenes of genuine comic value and some brilliant one-liners, and so this film doesn't alienate anyone.Above all, Team America is a satire. It, however, does not pick on the hard line neoconservatives of the Bush administration or the weak liberals in particular. It has a good laugh at everyone equally.The soundtrack of Team America is fantastic, and will have you almost wetting yourself with laughter, whilst the puppets move in such a way that, even in the ""serious"" scenes, you can't help but chuckle.I would seriously advise that you go to see this film in a cinema, as this is where it has it's full comic effect.

Thus the average rating... It appears I need at least 10 lines to post this comment, but sadly I don't have that much to say about the movie. There were about 5 scenes I found hilarious, very funny stuff... but it's more of a movie you'd find funny in clips, split apart from the dull drawn out story. Some very random moments make for a good chortle, but it's still a very boring movie if you're watching it by yourself.",Team America - World Police
458,kiLLshoTT,Definitely the best (marionette puppet) movie of all time...,9,31 May 2006,"...by the creators of South Park. These guys keep making ""great"" movies, this one possibly being the best. A truly original, at least in its genre, it's yet another on-the-money commentary on the good ol' US of A, with a splash of total absurdity. I say ""great"" because their movies are always over-the-top crude, usually stupid in several ways, but still intellectually hilarious and accurate to some extent. Everything is right-and wrong-about this movie(luckily, all the wrong things are wrong in the the best ways possible). Trey Parker and Matt Stone make it very clear that they take issue with everyone, especially extreme rightists and leftists. Their are too many incredibly funny things about this movie to list, so suffice it to say that this movie is absolutely worth watching unless you seriously restrict your movie taste so much that you blindly refuse to watch it, as did my wife. In that case you would hate it whether you watched it or not, which is the biggest problem with their movies and with South Park. The medium is often so foul and inappropriate that the message doesn't get delivered to anyone but those who can 1)stomach the vulgarity, and 2)be of adequate intellect to understand the social and political relevance. My wife is a great example. She will never watch South Park but if I watch an episode and relay it to her, she thinks it's hilarious, but still refuses to watch it-not even the episode I relayed, which she thought was so hilarious! She can't stand the inappropriateness of it, but loves the messages. Don't be like her, watch this movie.

459,TheCaptain12,"Not as horrible as Orgazmo, but close",2,19 April 2006,"This movie is the second most feeble attempt by Stone/Parker (see my review of Orgazmo). With this film, I think the two dunderheads were going for genuine satire but what they achieved was another pointless, puerile piece of mediocrity that belongs in the trash instead of your DVD player. The plot is awful, which would be all right if the humor was there, but in most cases it's not. There were a few redeeming qualities, such as the soundtrack, the infamous vomit scene, and the subtle parody of that God-awful abomination ""Rent,"" but most of the film relies on Parker/Stones witless sense of humor that somehow takes the random and shocking and makes it trite, mundane, and just plain unfunny. Instead of even remotely resembling a clever satire of American jingoism, (this movie was so poorly written, I'm not even sure that's what they were going for), this movie is reminiscent of a ten-year-old Rush Limbaugh's wet dream. And I had the misfortune of renting the unrated DVD with the extended puppet sex scene... disturbing at best. Don't see this movie, there are much better ways to spend 90 minutes.",Team America - World Police

Way to go Team America, you just save the whole world from danger. The action was so awesome and it was funny. Although, it was created by the creators of South Park and I don't really like South Park, Trey Parker did pretty damn great on these movie. Including the writers too. Gary's quote in the near end was the best and funniest quote in film history. Finally, something without South Park characters although it does has some references to the show but who cares, it's ass kicking and gut busting hilarious.

And, should someone have waited just 2 years to watch world events unfold, they'll realize that this movie quickly flew into oblivion as it was nothing more than a thinly disguised attack ad. Nothing more than maybe half a dozen talking points that were being howled out in the 2004 American general election.On the theme of ""we are fighting them there so we don't have to fight them here"", the story tellers give very little thought to American history and America's changing friends in the last 100 years. The movie fabricates another ""dictator"" figure that must be dealt with, and the pacifist type (depicted as treasonous losers and sycophants to the dictator) are shown as the real enemy.The puppetry (imagery) however, is fantastic indeed, and the sound effects are great. Too much swearing and ""fake gore"" is used to show humiliation and there is no shortage of (typical Hollywood) clichés. Highly contradictory if not ironic.Team America is an elite group of selected soldiers that go on overt missions to thwart the developing threats against the world. A mediocre actor joins their team to blend in with the enemy yet has no military skills.Will they succeed against this specific evil-doer?

Anyone who thinks this movie was biased more towards one side probably didn't understand all of the jokes. There are a lot of subtle jokes that many people don't understand, but are very funny. The song ""Freedom isn't Free"" is making fun of a quote by President Bush, ""the price of freedom is never free.""

From the creators of ""South Park"" comes ""Team America: World Police,"" and if that excites you, you'll enjoy it. Fans of ""South Park"" will be happy with this bloody, vulgar movie. Not that that's a bad thing.Trey Parker and Matt Stone have great minds for satire. ""Team America"" is full of it, from dangerous and uninformed Americans to dangerous and unintelligible terrorists. The best part is that liberals are skewered pretty openly, while the barbs at conservatives are subtle enough that most conservatives won't realize they're being zinged. The movie plays on every cliché of action movies; The member killed in the opening scene; his grieving lover; the green newbie; the grizzled veteran who doesn't trust the green newbie; the maniacal arch-villain (Kim-Jong Il); The musical numbers ... Okay, that's not normal.Also thrown in is the most explicit sex scene I've ever seen in a rated R movie. With puppets. Musical numbers include a country song so jingoistic it could actually be a country hit, if not for the swearing, the Team America fight song, ""America; F*** Yeah!"" and the popular ""Montage Song.""I was struck most by the detail put into the puppets and settings. The actors portrayed look like who they are supposed to be (including George Clooney, who should be p***ed that he ever appeared on Stone and Parker's show as a dog), and are amazingly expressive. The Times Square set is unbelievably realistic, as is Mount Rushmore.There are plenty of funny scenes. Marionettes involved in hand-to-hand fighting are good for a laugh, as are the first few bullet riddled puppet bodies. Where Stone and Parker tend to go wrong is overplaying the joke. Sure, it's fun to see a puppet try and walk solemnly from the room, but after a while you'll be saying ""I get it; they're puppets! Actors are whiney! Get on with it!"" With a running time of just over an hour and a half, you wouldn't think there could be too many stale jokes. Not so with these guys. Every bit is run into the ground. The saving grace is that there are new jokes thrown in from time to time, but not at the expense of the other ""seen it already"" bits.Overall, Parker and Stone get it right. They satirize everybody, and despite their over-the-top attitude, can get subtlety when they need to. I'm glad I saw this for free, but it's worth a rental. And don't bring your 4 and 6 year old kids, like the people next to me did. This R rating is well deserved. And remember, there's no ""I"" in ""Team America.""Yes there is.",Team America - World Police
474,lutenihon,One of the funniest movies I've seen a long time (WARNING: possible spoilers),7,10 October 2004,"I saw this movie last night at a preview, and from the first moment, I was laughing my a** off! I did not have high hopes at first for this movie, when I first saw the trailer, but after thinking about it and realizing it was from the makers of ""South Park"" I knew it would probably be really funny. It is a terrible movie from a realistic stand point to be sure, but when you look past that and think about the irony and listen to the jokes (not so subtle btw) it is extremely funny!! The movie is about a not so secret team of Americans who police the world and fight terrorists. Gary, an actor, is recruited to to join them because only his skills can help save the world. Along the way he falls in love with the Team's blond. The movie spares no one, and even pokes fun at itself, like when the main actor puppet, Gary, is thinking about joining Team America, we see him actually visit various American monuments. The movie also pokes fun at some politically active actors such as Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Matt Damon, etc etc and has them be part of the Film Actors Guild or F.A.G for short. It must be the first time a movie has ever featured a pornographic marionette sex scene. Most of the puppets are voiced by Matt Stone or Trey Parker. The real keeper of the movie is the soundtrack! Once again, Stone and Park delight with an original soundtrack that includes songs titled ""America! F*CK YEAH!!, Pearl Harbor SUCKED!, Time for a MONTAGE!, I'm so Lonely (sang by the movie's bad guy Kin Jong Il)"" and it even features a very good instrumental score as well. This movie truly is a send up to those Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay action flicks. The sad thing is that ALMOST everything that happens in this movie really does happen in most action movies. I kid you not! One can't help wondering while watching this movie that if it were given a serious treatment, it would probably be a decent B-movie.",Team America - World Police
475,spookyshock,An over-pretentious feast of misguided satire...,3,13 April 2006,"I was a huge fan of ""South Park"" in its early years (1997 - 2000), with its sharp, sardonic humor and its dark, underground flair. But lately the show, also created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, has become too preachy and up its own ass, as it has come to focus too much on innocuous details about current events. It has simply lost its creative edge. Much of this trend is evident in ""Team America: World Police."" The movie, which literally attacks all sides of the war on terror (especially the liberal point-of-view), is basically a garbled mess of half-heartedly funny, predictable dialogue and shock-humor merely intended to emphasize a political statement. There were actually some very funny parts like the puppet-sex scene, but, unfortunately, all coming in short doses. Overall, I'm somewhat thrown off by the movie's lack of focus and its failure to sufficiently criticize the pro-war mentality.""Team America: World Police"" was a slight disappointment. It is not in any way a memorable film and, quite frankly, I might not ever see another film made by the creators of ""South Park,"" as their recent work is becoming ever more devoid of originality and purpose.",Team America - World Police

I was very surprised to see some very intelligent comedic values placed in the movie. But I wasn't surprised to hear and see all the profanity. This movie is a mix of all types of comedy, whether it be political, sexual, slap-stick, etc. Parker and Stone did a great job on this one. Many of the jokes were laugh-out loud hilarious, especially the speeches given about the three types of people in the world. One thing I can't get over is the songs they add in the movie. When I heard ""America, **** yeah!"" I was on the floor dying from laughter. If you didn't enjoy Baseketball or South Park: The Movie, then see this anyways. It is many, many leagues higher than their previous movies. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves political humor or hates actors.",Team America - World Police

480,jtrunn84,Saying this movie 'sucks' is giving it way too much credit...,2,22 May 2007,"My brother and I (age 22 and 25) watched this movie after a great recommendation from a friend. We both dig south park, so we thought we had nothing to lose. I guess my friends and I don't share the same taste for appallingly bad toilet humor and obvious (not to mention recycled) jokes. The 'film' had one angle and message that it hit us over the head with until we just couldn't stand the boring bludgeoning anymore. OK, so the U.S. doesn't care who they kill or which national monuments they destroy in search of WMD-- **WE GET THE POINT**. It was made perfectly clear in the first 5 minutes.This was an incredibly ill-conceived movie, and they barely researched anything they tried to parody or attack. Chinese people can say their ""L's"" just fine (they don't say ronery), and ""dirka dirka"" was funny for about 2 seconds. We stopped watching not long after the puppet sex scene, and we felt our IQs slowly slipping away. Apparently poorly-made puppets saying ""suck my cock"" isn't quite the laugh riot Paramount was betting on. The plot and execution would have made for a passable southpark episode (many lame gags were borrowed from previous shows), but it's an insult to motion pictures, real art and satire across the globe.The only thing that kept me from rating this a 1 were the set pieces which must've taken considerable time and talent to create.-=AVOID AT ALL COSTS=-",Team America - World Police

That's been subtly evident for quite awhile in their South Park gig, but they've always seemed dangerous to me in the same way that a knucklehead like Thomas Friedman of the NYTimes seems dangerous: they take a strident ideological position that's carefully couched in some rhetorical game.Do we really need to unpack this mess? I mean, how crazy is it to attack all of these Hollywood ""liberals"" without holding accountable the loons on the right (O'Reilly, Hannity, Coulter, etc.)? I guess Parker and Stone would like us all, as a country, to stay locked forever in adolescence so we can appreciate the sophomorism of both our current president and their brand of humor. Don't let anyone tell you that these folks are equally damning toward the whole political spectrum (which, by the way, would make them equally dangerous and irrelevant in my book).

It was a riot, I hadn't laughed that hard it awhile.

486,mawtino,Very interesting and visually stunning work...,9,14 February 2006,"I was one of the lucky few who saw the pre-release sneak preview a few years back and I was happily satisfied with the work overall. The sets were absolutely incredible and Trey and Matt really pushed puppeteering to it's limits. I was so impressed, I bought the unrated DVD and realized I had missed so much of the interesting Dada-inspired trivial that I was really glad I bought the DVD, too.The story. On first look, while not appearing deep, this movie seems fluffy and right-leaning but in reality Trey and Matt have touched on the true global conspiracy that seems overlooked by the modern leftist media. Funding streams primarily from Kim Jong Il and secondarily from Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Ladin lead to the organization known as International ANSWER (a.k.a. World's Worker's Party), the same organization that funds most protests against the G8, the protests against the war, and smaller scale protests such as the recent riot in Cincinnati. Their only desires are to promote anarchy (particularly the anti-American flavor) and the destruction of Israel. The only real common element to their protests are violence and anarchy/nihilism, some of Jong-il's favorite things. This organization also receives quite a bit of funding from the modern Hollywood illuminati. So in essence, while this is fiction and satire, it hits the mark on timeliness/truthfulness. And as a response to the current ""Truthiness"" of Michael Moore's fictitious Farenheit and al Jazeera's Control Room, this is a stellar statement.While Parker and Stone don't delve very deeply into modern Oligarichal Collectivism, neither Left nor Right, they do touch on the inherent hypocrisy of the American reaction to conflict (the waging of war to promote peace) but never letting up on the Fascist aspect of pacifism.They strap a suicide bomb vest on Michael Moore and put Robbins/Sarandon into the role of palace guards in North Korea.Parker and Stone also spend a good deal of the movie criticizing the ignorance of other cultures that is so American as to be our national motto. From Panama with it's marijuana-leaf trees surrounding a giant canal, to Paris depicted simply as Marcel Marceau impersonators and monuments, to Muslims speaking the same 4 words over and over, to Egypt being nothing more than 3 pyramids and sand, this movie spells it out in humor unmatched.Overall, the point is made and reiterated but the audience is not beaten over the head with it, as has been suggested by prior commenter's. Actually, I'm amazed how many people have hated this movie but reading the responses the common theme is ""it sucked cuz they didn't bash the president"". But with the daily barrage from the Media and Hollywood ramming the point down our throats, it was a refreshing change of pace that they didn't hurl a single handful of crap at the president as Moore and Baldwin make a hobby of doing at every chance. The president can't seem to sneeze without Olberman, Blitzer, and Rather analyzing and criticizing it frame-by-frame, drawing comparisons to the National Socialists in the 1930's and getting the Democratic Reaction from Joe Trippi, Flavia Colgan, and Katrina vanden Heuvel, while showing the latest 2-second-edit montage of Dubya juxtaposed against chimpanzees in various emotional states. I just wonder how many Liberals will toe the party line and give this a 1 rating simply because they don't like the message.Then again, maybe it was just a fluffy little comedy with puppets in funny situations.",Team America - World Police

Needless to say, I was not disappointed.Look, beyond the fact that the whole thing is geniously done entirely with marrionettes, what you get is a quality movie that you can tell a lot of production value went into. The scenes are beautifully done, and at times the facial reactions by the puppets themselves look eerily human. What Parker and Stone do, is what they do best, make fun of themselves and the movie as much as they rag on everyone else in the world.

If this movie was made without them, this would not be a funny movie. What makes it funny is that you can never imagine puppets being put inside such funny, twisted and horrific scenes.

The low budget puppets and the lack of a deeper understanding of the conflict between USA and the Muslim world is makes this movie just plain awful.

Sometimes it's unintentionally idiotic, sometimes it's intentionally idiotic, and sometimes it's brilliant. Team America unfortunately falls in the first category. It's the kind of humor that I heard many time during the lunch hour of middle school. It's a shame, because it starts off as a satire of America's aggressive foreign policy, and less than halfway turns into a satireless rant against liberal Hollywood.But the stupidity begins before that. It really starts with a song parody of the musical ""RENT"", that is literally just one line repeated over and over again. It could have been a hilarious parody, but no, apparently ""AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS"" is supposed to be funny in and of itself.The next point of stupidity is a dumb sex joke (which is repeated again later in the film).

In keeping with their now long-standing tradition of brilliantly offensive humour in South Park, they've set out to capture much of the absurdity behind current events in Team America World Police. Fans of these creators will quickly see how their satirical victims are once again shown no mercy. Even their brilliant use of puppets, depicting all of their favorite targets from Hollywood celebrities to International figures of terrorism, doesn't escape the self references to the ridicule of their clumsiness, or of all the clichés their action figures are subjected to. Behind the highly entertaining humour, you'll find as many thought-provoking reflections on current World affairs as in Michael Moore's Farenheit 911, and then you'll see a double-take on Hollywood's superficial stance on it all.

496,shootfromthehip,Wonderfully poignant satire at a much needed time,10,10 October 2004,"No Spoilers.First off, I'd like to say that this film is everything a South Park/Trey Parker devotee could hope for. It's sly, it's vulgar, it's full of gore/profanity/violence/nudity, and it is made entirely with marionettes.The sheer amount of wit and subversive humor packed into this film is mind boggling, but yet it doesn't bog you down with vague references and really confusing in-jokes. And goddamn, puppets swearing/having sex/killing people/dancing never gets old. NEVER.The film is actually almost 2 hours long, but as expected, is one which time takes on less relevance. Of course, some people are going to see just how limited Trey Parkers voice talents are, but having 4 different minor character sound exactly the same is always a surefire treat. Take note that a grand total of zero big name actors lend their voice to this film, though Little B**ch(Dian Bachar) does give a little appearance here and there.The whole film is real. You heard me. Absolutely nothing in this movie (with the exception of the title credits and I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.) was done with computers. While this may sound impressive on paper, on film it's actually a masterful achievement. While Parker sometimes plays into the film's self-conscious aura and indulges the audience a bit, most scenes are played out to their full puppet potential. I'm sure this film will be a benchmark in the world of puppeteering for years to come, despite it's content.All in all, it was exactly what I expected (and I have high standards for Parker) and I could not have been happier with the result. A second viewing will be needed, just to take in all the detail of the film, as the sets are lush, elaborate and breathtaking scale models of cities all over the world.For those who want to bother comparing it to Parkers earlier forays, yes, it is better than Cannibal! and Orgazmo, but does not quite stand up to SP:BLU, but only because BLU had the background and the familiarity factor. After a second viewing, this opinion could very likely change.In other words, if you like this sort of stuff, you'll love it.

If anyone goes into the theatre not knowing that it's a parody or satire will probably walk out, because it's not meant to be taken as a serious attempt to make a good movie.

501,treklogan,"""America: F*@& YEAH!!!""",10,9 October 2004,"I just came from the sneak preview of Team America: World Police. It was of course, hilarious. Trey Parker and Matt Stone hit another one out of the park. They thoroughly make fun of the new gung-ho American foreign policy, terrorists and terrorism in general, racism, left wing movie stars, the Thunderbirds (duh) and that kind of 60's pop mentality, Broadway musicals, and mostly big budget action movies (Michael Bay is specifically mentioned). Plus, they manage to throw in a few South Park and Star Wars references for good measure. Most notable is a song straight out of a South Park episode, with the lyrics slightly changed (and yet, it manages to be equally hilarious the second time). There aren't many songs, but most of them are fantastic, particularly the theme song- ""America: F*@& YEAH!!!"". The only one I didn't really like was ""Lonely"", sung by Kim Jong-Il: I mean, the only funny thing about it is how he pronounces it ""Ronerey"". Perhaps the funniest thing about this movie is the puppetry. My god, is it hilarious. The puppet fight scene in the opening sequence might just be the funniest fight scene ever put to film. I'd heard that they had to cut out a bunch of puppet sex to get the NC-17 down to an R, but I can't imagine what they left out. I mean, the scene is like 5 minutes long, with nothing but puppet sex. How can you not admire that? As Mel Brooks said of his movie ""The Producers"", this movie somehow ""rises below vulgarity"". Alright, maybe not. But it sure is hilarious.",Team America - World Police
502,aa-47,"Not funny, tiresome, stupid",1,15 October 2004,"Boring. I never laughed once. Some people in the theater did, and some laughed a lot -- so I knew what was supposed to be funny. It just wasn't. Lame, lame, lame. I wasn't that I found it offensive, I just thought it wasn't funny. The marionette concept was weird and not in a good way. It was too distracting. I'm sure this movie was complex and expensive to make, but the writing was so bad it ruined it. I thought the first half was extremely bad and the second half was worse. All I could think about was how much longer is this going to go on. Well, it went on longer than I could take it and I walked out. I would not recommend paying to see this movie unless you're REALLY sure it's your thing.",Team America - World Police
503,MrMontage,Team USA is a worthless piece of celluloid trash,1,21 January 2005,"As a disclaimer, it should be known that I'm a fan of South Park.Given that, though, I have to say that this movie is poorly written, poorly constructed and poorly executed. Parker and Stone would have been better off keeping their money and putting it into another full length South Park feature rather than this.Although the film provides a handful of vulgar laughs, the essence of it is mean-spirited, beyond what I consider humor.The film attempts a political satire, yet comes off as horribly one-sided, which is unusual for the normally 'nothing is sacred' humor that is the hallmark of Parker/Stone humor. It essentially pits a group of 'liberal' caricatures against a group of composite characters. I think this is the heart of my conflict with their attempt. If they would have had the guts to use caricatures for the 'all American' characters, I believe the film would have exuded more balance. As it stands, though, this is simply not the case.Political satire aside: the story-line is shallow, contrived and very, very unoriginal. Again, this is a departure for Parker and Stone.In order to view this film properly, you should whack yourself several times in the head with a hammer to obtain the proper mindset. After the film, a shower is recommended.",Team America - World Police
504,k2i,Funny but ruined by excessive language and vulgarity.,1,25 December 2004,"A lot of the humor was actually quite funny and the story line was interesting too. Yet I felt that it was made nearly unwatchable to most people due to extremely overused and far too detailed sexual references and excessive language. These went far beyond humor and hurt the scenes that they were in.This could have been a great movie, but in the end I was disappointed. Next time I think they should tone the vulgarity down to at least the level of their TV aired South Park offerings. I like the humor but I want something watchable.2/10",Team America - World Police

Foul language, puppets and sex, mixed with international and national politics is an unusual, unique, and funny mixture. If you can handle it, it is worth seeing. If there is any political statement being made, it went by me. It is simply too silly to be taken seriously. That is the fun of it though. If Moore is your hero, you are probably too emotional to accept the film for what it is.If you are afraid of offending other nationalities, you are not ready for this film. It would be your loss though. We should all have a good laugh at how silly the world and all its people are.",Team America - World Police
506,bmxmike825,Team America delivers strong satirical comedy in puppet form...,9,18 May 2005,"After hearing rave reviews from friends and family about the movie Team America: World Police, I went out on a limb and bought the DVD. This was one of the best investments I have made in a long time. The movie itself is an extremely funny movie that is visually stunning and is a truly effective satire of various aspects of American life, politics, and foreign policy.First off this movie is chock full of humor. From simple vomit jokes to clever lampoons of American life this movie delivers constant, laugh-out loud comedy. The characters are relatively deep and show growth throughout the movie, and each character has his/her sense of humor and background story. The portrayals of various foreign countries and peoples is well executed and extremely funny. Even the simple vomit and sex jokes deliver strong laughs to the audience.The movie itself is a production and art masterpiece. With the exception of certain things like I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., there is no use of CGI or computerized effects in this movie. All scenes are done with real marionettes and real backgrounds. The fact that Trey and Matt were able to create such a vivid world for and used by puppets is astonishing. Although sometimes you lose focus of the background in the action of the movie, the scenes are stunning. One great thing about the DVD is their explanation of how the puppets were developed and manipulated and also how the scenes were made and the various ""found objects"" in the scenes..(including a certain type of plant).Finally, the satire of the movie is where this film truly shines. Being an avid fan of ""South Park,"" I understand and genuinely enjoy Matt and Trey's in your face extremely clever form of satire. The plot of the movie is relatively strong and each scene pieces together perfectly offering a new form of satire with each change. People of foreign descent, especially the French and the Middle Easterns, are portrayed to mimic the way Americans perceive them, and it is hilarious. The in your face attitude and bravado of Team America is a perfect spoof of the superiority complex America often takes in its foreign affairs. Even small things like Broadway shows, AIDS, homosexuality, and human ignorance are satired. Hollywood especially takes fire from Matt and Trey's satirical arsenal. Various actors from Alec Baldwin to Helen Hunt are spoofed and the Screen Actors Guild especially receives heat. Even Michael Moore is lampooned in this movie.Finally the soundtrack is great. Every song is complete with humorous lyrics, a great beat, and fits perfectly in with the movie. My favorite songs are the AIDS song, the Montage song, and of course, the Team America theme song.Overall, this movie is great and it lived up to the reviews that other people gave me. If you are in the mood to see a great satire of America, a great comedy, or just a great movie in general, do not hesitate to see Team America: World Police.",Team America - World Police
507,t1m31s4h4x0r,The funniest film I've ever seen and my #1 film of the year.,10,17 October 2004,"Team America: World Police is the funniest movie ever made. Seriously. I knew going into it I would love it, but I had no idea it would surpass my expectations in every way. Never once in my life have I laughed that hard during a movie. And not only did it make me laugh hard, I was laughing really hard the entire time. They weren't those little giggles that you get during most regular comedies, I was laughing until I hurt the whole film. I had to hold back laughter at times just to be able to hear it.The dialogue is brilliant. It's vulgar and smart at the same time. It went so much further than I ever expected. It was a perfect spoof of those generic Bruckheimer action movies. The sets were amazing. Everything had so much detail to it. The music was absolutely perfect. Trey did all the songs in the movie and if you are familiar with the music from South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut, you know what to expect. Well...sorta.Team America is my favorite movie of the year and one of my favorite films ever. Before seeing this my favorite movie of the year was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's so original and unlike anything you are ever likely to see. I doubt we'll see another marionette film done this way ever again. Their portrayal of the celebrities is one of my favorite aspects of the movie. Never again will you see a group of well known actors and actresses like this. I haven't liked a comedy this much since Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and I already like it more than that.I think I've covered everything I can without really giving anything away. I give Team America: World Police a perfect 10 out of 10.",Team America - World Police

It's just a great piece of art, even though it could've been better in some ways it doesn't matter, because they had to rewrite the movie all the way through, so we have to know that this wasn't the way they wanted it to be. but it is great anyway, we have to take in mind also that this movie is the first in its class ( thunderbirds don't count ) and you simply can't compare it to nothing else. If somebody doesn't like it .. well , I guess you just don't have sense of humor. This movie required a lot of work and a lot of courage. It is funny and you all know it. This movie is for ""interigent"" people.",Team America - World Police

I've never seen the SouthPark movie, but I know the creators of SouthPark created this movie as well. They did a great job with the puppets. Trey Parker did an excellent job. I really liked what they did with Alex Baldwin as well. There better be a sequel to this movie because of the way the movie ended. Kim Jong Il turns into a cockroach and flies away in a little mini ship. Overall they did an excellent job. What I also liked about this movie was what they did with Gary Johnston after the bar he went out back and just vomited all over the the place that was pretty funny as well. I easily give it a 5 out of 5.",Team America - World Police

Sprinkle liberally with vulgarity and puppet vomit. Turn once and add a fine puppet glaze, and two guys doing the same voices for about 20 different characters and you've got yourself...TEAM America! I haven't laughed this hard in a movie theatre since...well ever! Team America seamlessley mixes endless action movie clichés (One-liner catch phrases, ultra-violent deaths, and explosions galore) with no-holds-barred celebrity bashing (Courtesy of Alec Baldwin, the greatest actor IN THE WORLD!) and somehow manages to work in a legitimate message about foreign policy in there too.

I just went to see it on 11/5 it was great. when something comes from the creator of south park it has to be sick, foul, and extremely funny. This is all true about Team America. From puppet sex to blowing up national monuments I was howling non stop. they make kim jong ill look like a complete idiot. you find out all about the characters and there completely stupid pasts. This is for sure not the kind of movie you take kids to. When somebody gets killed in this movie it is hilarious the way puppets explode.

512,MoeSzyslak73,"(SPOILER) Expect a team of 007s, Southpark style.",1,12 October 2004,"A funny movie, but not as much as I expected. The movie is about a bunch of reckless blood-thirst superheroes wannabe (aka. Team America) trying to police the world and track down the terrorist by all means and at all cost (of others). The bad guy here is North Korean Kim Jong Il. Anything that stands between him and Team America, from famous landmarks around the world to Hollywood celebrities, are blown into pieces.Although the whole story is built on USA's ""World Police"" image, it didn't go too deep into the politics. Jokes reside on the use of foul languages, porn-movies style sex scene, painful deaths of Hollywood celebrities, condemnation of other movie, and cheesy puppet actions and fighting sequences. Good for some chuckles, but no LMAO fun. The funniest bit in the movie is probably the one already stated in the title: Team ""America"", ""World"" Police. Most of the events happened in the movie were thousands of miles away from US. One thing disappoints me is the lack of George W.Bush in the movie, as you may expect one. Oh well...For $8, you have explosions, car-chase, lots of blood, crazy sex, 100+ body-counts and some bad jokes. Worth it if you like the SouthPark.",Team America - World Police

Rented it out to see it, and it was absolute crap. It gave me a few laughs (I call them laughs, more like silent chuckles), but all and all this movie is stupid, vulgar, unfunny and boring. Usually, well constructed vulgar jokes are funny but in this movie they say vulgar things that have no comedic merit whatsoever. The film bored me to the point were I just wanted to turn off the video and put something else on, and it really isn't funny. So if you haven't seen this film don't worry!

514,mattd925-1,Diverse Audience,10,15 October 2004,"I cant speak for everywhere but in the theater where I saw team America. Just looking at the 12:00 pm crowd I was quite surprised there were as many people as there was. Although it wasn't full there were 36 people most, about 20, under thirty I would say about ten middle aged and a half dozen senior citizens. I took the opportunity to ask an older couple who sat next to me why they had come and they said it was because of the sixty minutes interview with trey and matt. I would also like to note that no one walked out. I enjoyed the film for what it was and if you cant stomach the language or some of the other scenes you have to appreciate the tremendous detail on their small scale sets. Most impressive to me was a scene in the main lobby of Kim Jung il's palace in North Korea where there was a statue of him and fantastic chandeliers all scaled down, also pretty dead on replicas of Mt. Rushmore and lady liberty. Anyways I expected to be somewhat alone in the earliest showing of the film in my area and was surprised at the number of people, age range , etc. I can only assume the evening will be sold out.",Team America - World Police
515,achrola,Quite possibly the worst movie ever made,1,22 October 2004,"As a former fan of South Park I was shocked at how this movie lacked any form of intelligence and any form of decent comedy. The best jokes in this movie were actually taken right out of old South Park episodes and recycled (e.g. Sports Training Montage song taken verbatim from Asspen episode). This was just an obvious attempt to rush a movie out to try and cash in on the current political climate without any real idea of what that movie should be about. There was no point to the movie, and though 10 minutes of the movie went off on a painful tangent about how, ironically, the movie Pearl Harbor sucked because it ""missed the point"" - this movie itself had absolutely no political satire or point to it and there were painfully slow ""emotional"" dialogue scenes between puppets that seemed to actually try to build a plot, yet just made it painfully obvious how crappy the movie you paid $10 for really was. Save your money, save 2 hours of your life, and most of all save the lifetime of emotional damage you will have to go through because of the pure rage that comes from watching such a commercialized, sell-out, pro-Bush, piece-of-crap of a film. I could have made a better movie with my $10. If I ever meet Trey Parker or Matt Stone I will punch them both in the neck repeatedly for 2 hours and then charge them $10 for it - and that still won't be nearly as painful as what they did to me and charged me for.",Team America - World Police

517,AndreDude2,the movie is pretty drastic,4,17 October 2004,"While amazingly intelligent, and hilarious, the movie might actually be too over the top. Because it does so good a job at clowning on its targets, and the attacks it makes against conservatives and warhawks are much more subtle than those against the highbrow liberals, the political effect it has on a relatively uninformed audience watching just for comedic value does the left wing cause more harm than good. Another unsettling fact is that a Fox executive is helping to produce a political film; the Fox corporation has proved itself as right-wing in its coverage of news and politics. Sure, movie actors are a lot like puppets and Michael Moore is hardly self-effacing, but I could easily see movie-goers missing the fact that ""America, f*** yea!"" is a joke directed at right-wing testosterone and take the obvious liberal-bashing to mean that they should support our current president in this important election. The movie troubles me a little.",Team America - World Police

The outrageousness and irreverence are there; it was just a little too ambitious. Mocking Hollywood and America should've been two separate film, the combination of the two didn't work for me. (On a side note, in my own script I do mock Michael Bay and Ben Affleck. I wrote this script long before I saw the movie so I don't want anyone giving me the business when they see it.)

519,ajb-imdbpro,"Dear god, I'm speechless.",9,9 October 2004,"This may be the rudest, most offensive, politically insensitive, disgusting, foul-mouthed movie I've ever seen.Absolutely awesome. I've just come from the sneak preview, so it's all fresh and squishy in my head. It's difficult, in fact, to describe this film on IMDb without lapsing into a tsunami of glowing obscenities. It's kind of like driving on the Autobahn, then turning off onto a dirt road -- it's hard to slow down. I've become ""profanitized."" But I'll give it a shot...Parker and Stone have taken everything we know about action movies, America, puppets and Alec Baldwin, and turned them all inside out, so we can see the pink squishy stuff and bones and veins and endochrine system inside. They lay into America's ""we know best, dammit"" culture of jingoistic jingle-singing ass-kickers with such ferocity that G.W. must be wetting his bassinette tonight just from the ""dis"" vibes. But the hawks aren't the only victims of the ParkerStone barbecue. Bleeding Heart Liberal Weenies (I'm one of 'em, mind you) take their share of head shots, too. Like a Tourette's version of that ""This Land Is Your Land"" animated election parody currently making the internet rounds, the boys have taken an even-handed path to Armageddon. And just for good measure, they've pretty much put Jerry Bruckheimer, Tony Scott and (of course) Michael Bay out of business with a single picture. It'll be impossible to watch one more ""Top Gun"" air battle, one more ""Matrix"" bullettime spin-freeze, or one more ""Rocky"" underdog-in-training montage, without imagining the actors in those films dangling from little black threads. (In which case, I suppose, the boys have done the world a favor of canonizable proportions.)There does seem to be a point lurking somewhere under all the puppet barf. Parker and Stone actually seem to believe that America does sometimes have a ""world protector"" role to serve... but we need the Liberal Weenies too, to remind us when we've gone too far. (A simple enough message, but one that our current presidential candidates seem to be unable to communicate.) Parker and Stone pull it off with an oil-tankerload of Vulgarity, Nose- Thumbing, and Pee-In-Your-Pants Funny. Sleep well tonight, boys. You done good. NOTE: If this movie was cut down from an ""NC-17"" to an ""R"" rating, I can't even begin to imagine what might have been in the original. Damned if I can think of anything they left out.",Team America - World Police
520,mtopham,My non-political disdain for Team America (1/10),1,17 October 2004,"Despite the claims of the masses, this is not the funniest movie of the year. The concept of puppets performing what an actor would [attempt to] do is hilarious. Unfortunately, the concept does not transfer to the screen. I respect the writers' and director's position (my contention is not with the politics of the film), as varying perspectives are always important on any issue. This is particularly true of an issue as serious the one satirized in the movie. However, the content of the film hardly merits praise. Expletives, though mildly humorous, are not enough to sustain a movie for the length I was unfortunate enough to have spent with this one. Seeing puppets die horrible, horrible deaths, again though humorous, is not enough to warrant more than a short (re: fifteen minutes, tops). I must admit that I was intrigued by the notion of two puppets having intercourse with one another, but having to wait to see it and then sitting through more movie after, hardly justifies the moderate amount of jocularity inherent in such a perversely fascinating spectacle. Of course, most people are going to disagree with me, which is their right, but I'll warn anyone from wasting their money on the mediocre amount of humour in this overlong concept film. Rent season one of Thunderbirds if you must see puppets doing people things.",Team America - World Police

If you enjoy South Park you will love this movie. There are so many funny lines and scenes that it would take too long to recount them all. Besides, I don't want to ruin the movie for people that truly want to see it. If you want to laugh like you've never laughed before see Team America: World Police.

Supporters and opponents of US military adventurism are pilloried, and yet will enjoy the film if they have a sense of humour.Yet the real targets are not soldiers, politicians and terrorists, but the movie-making formula and self-obsessed activist actors. It reminded me of Christopher Morris' Brass Eye in its representation of celebrities with causes.The plot is of course totally absurd, but this doesn't matter. This is not about the story.

This movie shows how much people will listen to celebrities and believe and do everything they say. Also being a fan of the ""Thunderbirds"" series, it is great to see a movie of the same caliber. If you like marionettes, this will be the only puppet movie for years to come, and because of this, ""Team America"" will instantly become a cult classic.

You will notice that some of the characters take after SouthPark favorites, and the reason for that is Trey Parker was the voices for a majority of the actors. I would definitely recommend this movie, but always with a warning that you may walk away offended. I would be surprised if the song ""I'm so Ronery"" wasn't nominated for an award!

As we exited the theater, we were asked to give feedback. I only heard positive comments. This was consistent with the audience laughing through about 80% of the movie.Other than the puppetry, there is nothing substantively new in Team America. Anyone who has watched South Park over the years will find the themes and language familiar. TA takes these themes and language and applies them to U.S. foreign policy in the ""War on Terror.""That being said, the movie carries more of an impact because it is designed to entertain the public while angering those who take themselves way too seriously in U.S. politics. Stone and Parker, showing libertarian leanings, go out of their way to offend Democrats both on foreign policy issues and by making fun of certain Hollywood actors. The language and sexual themes throughout the film will offend gays and Christian fundamentalists.There are two memorable sex scenes in the movie, both of which are probably not suitable for pre-teens to view even though the puppets are not anatomically correct. But for these two scenes, the movie might have earned a PG-13 rating from the inconsistent MPAA. The ending was a bit of a let down. However, one should stay to listen to the music during the credits because some of the lyrics were drowned out by audience laughter during the movie.

(isn't that a fire code violation?) What a f*cking funny film. I was trying to remember when I laughed so hard and often in the theaters and it was Blazing Saddles back in 76. (the Mel Brooks movie). This movie will p*** off the liberals in the media so expect poor reviews. But don't believe them, just like the forged CBS documents, the ABC Memo about going easy on Kerry, and NBC News using a picture of Bush with ILIE in the background(FAMILIES was the word cropped out of the picture) the media is doing everything it can to help Kerry win this election. But when the movie starts and you hear the lyrics to the song ""fighting for America, f*ck yea"" - the liberal media will call it immature and juvenile. Don't believe your local socialist movie critic's review of this movie, however whether your liberal or conservative you'll have a great time at this flick",Team America - World Police
532,DLibon,GO TEAM America,10,10 October 2004,"Team America is the greatest puppet movie ever made. I almost choked/died/ wet myself laughing. The plot is simple, a group of superheros our out to save the world from terrorist. Little do they know, they are hated throughout America. Hilarious scenes include(SPOILER!!!!)Michael Moore as a suicide bomber - Puppet sex - Kim Jong Il singing - A tone of puking - The 3 types of people - Susan Surandan being reduced to a bloody pulp All this and more!!! You cannot miss this movie!!!! If you cannot laugh at this, then you have problems!!!!!",Team America - World Police
533,jcwillner,funniest movie i have sen in over a year,10,10 October 2004,"The best F***ing movie i have seen in a long time. My face hurt from laughter, the couple sitting next to me was outrageously loud & the woman in the couple had to bend over in the seat and grab her knees halfway through the film to stop hyper-ventilating.When this movie comes out next Friday (i saw a sneak peek) go see it.Within the first 2 min the entire theater was belly-laughing, even before any real dialog started.P.S. if you are worried about the semi-political nature of it, well. take it with a grain of salt and go see it anyhow. you will not be disappointed.",Team America - World Police
534,duckay,This Movie is By far the funniest and most action packed of 2004,10,11 October 2004,"This Movie was indeed so hilarious. i saw it at one of the preview screenings this weekend..and boy was i satisfied...i was laughing my ass of the entire film!!!! this movie is just so funny. There is a lot of greatly done explosions. There is a lot of celebrity ripping, which is to be expected from Matt Stone and Trey Parker.. i will definitely see this movie again and again. This movie has a lot of great songs as well. Kim Jong Il sings a song all about how lonely he is..or should i say ronery. i missed the first 5 minutes..but I'm willing to pay full price to see it again and again..this movie will go down in the books i tell ya.I cannot wait until this movie hits theaters and i am able to watch it whenever i please. The World police in the movie are very cool people..it has like an espionage sort of thing going on...they also have i.n.t.e.l.l.i.g.e.n.c.e which is like a computer that monitors the world.",Team America - World Police
535,mharleyj,Nihilism at its finest,1,11 October 2004,"I thought that this movie was going to make fun of America trying to be the world police but instead seemed to make the most fun of action films, Michael Moore and the Screen Actors Guild by calling them F.A.G.s. Hehheh, hehheh. Now that's just really funny calling someone a fag-if you're a teenage, homophobic boy.It is interesting to see that the only real people in the film are Michael Moore, Hans Blix, North Korea's Kim-Jung-Il and a host of progressive actors protesting the US war in Iraq. Seems that many in need of roasting were left out of the film: O'Reilly, authors of Patriot Act, proclaimers of the Christian right, etc. Perhaps what is really scary is that the film censored out any real right-wingnuts because they were scared or Parker and company have become O'Reilly 'undecided' ditto heads. It's truly a film worthy of Fox-downed TV.And, saying that something is funny because it is satire, does not make it so. Lampooning progressive actors who are speaking out against a current war was simply a humorless cheap-shot. But perhaps that's the point, the whole thing is meaningless. This movie is a sell-out to the almighty buck, not satire but nihilism at its finest.But then, if you can't get enough of banal plots, dolly sex, projectile barf, political confusion, bad music, racism, and potty humor with no redeeming quality or humor, then this is the movie for you.",Team America - World Police
536,JJCalder19,Utterly stupid,1,9 October 2006,"Don't even waste your time. What a stink fest this movie was. I was hoping for something hysterical, its the guys from Southpark! And it turns out to be a convoluted, too much dialog for dolls, waste of time movie. Were they trying to make a political statement? Making fun of terrorism? I have no idea. I found it to be a complete and total mess. For arguments sake, I will say that the Film Actors stuff was OK, and the puppet sex was, for lack of a nicer word...interesting, but I can't believe a studio put money behind this movie. They should have taken the hint when Baseketball tanked. These two should just stick to doing Southpark.",Team America - World Police
537,MetroidMenagerie,"Team America: Finally, a satire with puppets!!!",10,12 October 2004,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Politics aside, the visuals alone caused nonstop laughs at the sneak peek Saturday. I saw it in Rhode Island, a Kerry state, and everyone there was screaming throughout the film, and a standing ovation was given.Don't look too deeply into the political persuasions of Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Both are Libertarians and in the middle. They make fun of American liberals and conservatives. Celebrity know it alls like Michael Moore, Janeane Garafalo, Sean Penn, and Susan Surandon are completely destroyed in this film, as is the jingoistic American right, country western singers and nation building ""World Police"". Take this film as it is: Satire with puppets, or for fans of Parker and Stone's other work, South Park with puppets. There's fun for liberals and conservatives here, and the low quality puppets and low brow toilet humor (not to mention hilarious puppet sex) even gives people with no political background something to laugh at. This is definitely the funniest movie of the year, whether you respect the jokes or not.",Team America - World Police
538,thetraveltart,One of the funniest movies of all time!,10,15 February 2013,"Team America World Police is so funny because it is so close to the truth and no one is spared. The South Park team make fun of almost anything and everything related to terrorism and 'American imperialism' that I spent the entire movie laughing on the floor. There are also some classic one liners in here that are unforgettable. Because the team used puppets instead of real people, I feel this made the movie more hilarious that it could have been! If you listen carefully to the soundtrack, there are some great songs that fully complement the visuals. Definitely a cult classic.

But there was too much tripe in-between. I was expecting to be offended by something given the commercials they have been playing, but I wasn't offended at all. The only thing that offended me was that someone expected me to think this movie was funny. It just wasn't. Someone else here said the jokes go on for too long, and that's just it. You laugh in the beginning of each joke, but then as it drags on you end up thinking, ""OK, OK, I get it, can we move on now?""For example: the sex scene. I laughed when it first went on the screen. The concept of the two marionettes having sex was funny. But how many positions do we really need to see? The joke was funny with the first one. The next several that followed were just overkill, and had me looking at my watch.",Team America - World Police
540,mdb384,America F*** YEAH!!!,10,16 October 2004,"Yeah it's amazingly crude and vulgar, but what else would you expect from the writers of Southpark? I think it's extremely clever and it certainly puts a lot of controversy into a delightfully humorous context. And the marionettes? Oh the marionettes MY GOD THAT'S FUNNY SH!T. The best part about them is they have these big, glossy, eyes that are so darned expressive you can't help but invest a little emotion. Especially in a few scenes where for an instant, you are face-to-face with the marionettes' harrowing realization that they're just dolls and have limited range of motion. It just breaks your friggin' heart. If you're skeptical, I can assure you that this is a hundred times more evolved than the poop jokes of Southpark. It is a must see!",Team America - World Police

I look for many other people to be upset by this waste of time. There is no social redeeming value in any of this joke of a movie.It probably reflects the life styles of the people that made this movie.Typical of the sleeze that comes from Hollywood.Degenerate lowlife with the morals less than animals .",Team America - World Police
542,Pink_Michele_Floyd,Har Har Double Har!,10,17 October 2004,"Team America was absolutely hilarious. Lots of folks, teenie and oldie, will hear that by word of mouth. Though suffering a touch of a cold, I cleared out my sinuses watching this film, it was that brilliantly funny. The songs were outrageously hilarious. I loudly exclaim to every country singer who attempts patriotic poignancy to give it a rest, for all time. The only parts I didn't like, were the ones that most people enjoyed. For instance, the vomiting was nauseous, and the sex scene in hotel room was cheap and tawdry. Still, I laughed like a hyena, so I don't give a rip whether this film is a box office smash or not. The writers have enough money, anyway! My opinion of the state of the world was not changed, glad to say, but I feel better knowing that others are snickering at the whole mess, as well.",Team America - World Police
543,moomoomoz,Horrible Film,1,17 October 2004,"This movie made me lose respect for Matt Stone and Trey Parker. It is obvious they half-sassed this entire film, from the dialog to educating themselves on political issues. This film just showed me how hypocritical the two men are, making fun of several celebrities because they take a stance on the Iraq war, but never once making fun of themselves. Are they not taking a stance on the war themselves by making this movie? I saw a skit one time on Mad TV that made fun of South Park and at first I did not like it...but now I know where Mad TV is coming from. Matt and Trey are lost in their own little rich fantasy lives and are consumed by thoughts of what the rest of the celebrity world thinks about them, this is why they take every chance they can to make fun of a new celebrity every week. It's getting old, guys...it's time for you two to find inner peace, I find meditation to be helpful in relieving day to day pressures.",Team America - World Police

If you find yourself offended, don't be surprised -- but try not to take yourself so seriously that you don't appreciate the messages. Some are subtle, some are not so subtle.

I mean how many movies can get away with a puppet using a puppet!! The first thing you see in the opening seen is a french puppet putting on a street show with a marionette...it just get 's better from there. You got hot puppet sex, puppet martial arts, heavy puppet gunfire, lots of puppet blood, drunk puppets, dancing puppets, I could go on. Let's not forget about the ""montage"". And the music...such instant classics as ""America, F%ck Yeah!"" and ""Freedom cost a buck 'o five"". Just remember when going to see this movie keep an open mind. It is very crass, very harsh and NO ONE IS SAFE! This is definitely for people who don't offend easily. Team America is so funny that you almost miss the point I think the film makers were trying to get across. Even a blind man could see it, but the humor makes it easier to take. I will say that I was SHOCKED at how many parents were dropping there kids off to see this movie. I knew from all the press that this movie was not for children. AGAIN I SAY, along with everyone else and the ""R"" rating this is NOT FOR THE EASILY OFFENDED, FAINT OR YOUNG! If you are a consenting adult and can buy your own tickets with your own money, then please check this movie out!

546,ChoiceWords,"Best ""Summer Movie"" in years",10,18 October 2004,"As one could expect, this film is completely debauched and massively subversive -- thank God! Employing marionettes was a stroke of genius: besides the fact that they don't ask annoying questions about their ""motivation,"" their acting was a lot less wooden than what you see in most action flicks, and just looking at them made me laugh remembering the cheesy TV fare of my childhood. As soon as I left the theater, half a dozen scenes instantly came to mind that made me want to see it again. My personal favorite moment (for sheer silliness): Kim Jung Il's panthers. Plus, an unforgettable blend of lyrics and music that just worked. I laughed so hard and so much that afterwards, I felt like I'd been working on my abs.",Team America - World Police
547,JohnnyRocketts,God bleeding boring,1,18 October 2004,"First off: I am a huge South Park Fan, I have all the episodes ever broadcast. The set design and the puppets themselves for Team America were brilliant, but this movie wasn't. It wasn;t offensive, it wasn't sarcastic, it wasn;t even nihilistic as Ebert & Roeper said... it just wasn't FUNNY! Two giggles at most in the whole damn thing. What an enormous let down, I cannot begin to tell you how disappointing this piece of garbage was. And then to recycle that ""Montage"" thing from a South Park episode! So lame!

Unfortunately, I was disappointed and bored. If marionettes' awkward movement crack you up...then maybe you'll enjoy this film. It seemed like that's what the few people who were laughing, were laughing at. As for ""making fun of everyone"", I didn't see that at all. It looked like most of the making fun of, was directed at the ""Left"", and it just wasn't funny.

549,fatlittleboy,JIHAD,10,19 October 2004,This movie was so amazing that i laugh so hard a tear dripped down my face. The satire in this movie is a-flaming along with the irony and the use of the publicly used word Jihad. Not seeing this movie 3 or 4 times more would make me have a religious struggle or holy war on my self. The use of martinet (disregard the spelling) puppets were a little iffy for me before the movie but it could not be better not even if real people played the parts. On top of the great puppetering and the amazing script and scenery there was the best music i have ever heard. Which amazingly was all created by Matt stone and tray parker the everything to this movie. I like this movie more than Michael Bain missed the mark when he made pearl harbor.,Team America - World Police
550,Turil,Yawn. (Possible SPOILERS),1,20 October 2004,"I stopped watching South Park for the same reason that I couldn't stand this film. I'm not offended by being made fun of. I know that they try to parody both the right and the left - and they certainly do in this film - the problem is that there is no point to it all. Good satire is supposed to make you think, make you question your own opinions, as well as start seeing things from your ""opponent's side"". The idea of satire is to turn the tables. But Parker and Stone seem to have lost the passion for doing anything but insulting people. They used to have a real talent for getting liberals and conservatives to be able to laugh at themselves, while opening their minds up to opposing ideas. But this movie just alternates between being annoying and boring. I didn't care about anything while watching it. I just wanted it to be over. (Though I suppose that it could all be an elaborate scheme to parody the whole political disaster that we're in these days in the US: we all just want it to be over, so that we can get on with our lives!)The puppets were great and the production values were excellent, but that's pretty much the end of the good stuff. You might be able to extract 10 minutes of somewhat funny scenes if you really tried. (And at least a minute of those 10 minutes would be the ""panther"" scene, which admittedly had me giggling.) To me, it was a real waste of time. It had such potential!",Team America - World Police
551,rreno-1,Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen,1,20 October 2004,"I was very embarrassed to be in the theater where courageous soldiers of the United States may be viewing what I would consider a very over the top attempt at political commentary. The symbolism was idiotic and so elementary a hammer might as well have dropped out of the ceiling to hit each of us in the head to make sure we got the point. While I certainly am a believer of free speech and that is the very basis of what our soldiers defend, this was just too much. The ""theme' song was grating and vulgar to give it the best politically correct review I can muster. Just from an artistic point of view , to have to endure the entire movie and then be departing the movie with that clap-trap blaring in your ears just added to the miserable experience. I went to the movie because I read a review that said it was funny and I needed some cheer in my day. I left the theater the most depressed I have been in quite some time.",Team America - World Police
552,mcguirerocks,There's nothing quite like South Park humor...,10,23 October 2004,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comic geniuses. It doesn't matter what person, scenario, or current event they are making fun of, they do it with just the right balance of style and crude humor. As if it didn't shine enough in their South Park series, they've gone and taken it to a whole new level with ""Team America: World Police"". The whole film relies solely on marionettes for actors and model backgrounds for shooting locations, in true Thunderbirds fashion. This naturally brings out the humor in seeing a puppet trying to do everyday things like point or walk, only so utterly horrible. Then the trademark humor of Matt and Trey emerges, making the film a constant laugh-out-loud experience. Similar to their South Park film, the movie has a bit of musical mixed into it, though not nearly as much as South Park (which might be better for most). Don't let this fool you, though. There are plenty of original songs for the movie, and they are all funny. The Team America theme song stands out the most by far, and I find myself singing it and laughing even while typing this. I noticed one song pulled from the South Park series, but since it fit in perfectly with the movie, I didn't even bother to object. Trust me when I say that if you are even a remote fan of South Park, you will really enjoy this movie.",Team America - World Police

Why would anyone in our country care what an actor thinks about foreign policy. My favorite line in the movie was when Gary the actor was told to ""act"" his way in to a terrorist hangout. The French were slammed pretty good too. I hope there is a sequel. I used to watch the Thunderbirds as a child and was amazed that marionettes could be used that way. Little did I know these guys would make puppet sex almost X rated. This was one of the best movies of the year. I hope the producers get enough recognition to win some awards for their efforts.

Instead I found that they used the f-word whenever they could. There were scenes that were totally revolting and repulsive (especially the convulsive vomitting scene and the puppet sex acts). The brief description of the movie that was given did not tell enough about this HORRIBLE movie. This further discourages me from seeing movies at the box office. This movie should have had another rating. The description should have said that this was a VULGAR movie and that it was tasteless and lewd.

If the MPAA only knew what there five year olds could be doing with there little ""My Little Ponies"" and ""Barbie"" dolls. Believe me I have done it.

Micheal Moore makes a guest appearance, and if your a fan of his fiction films, you'll either be offended, or surprised of the consipiracy behind his consipiracy theories, portrayed in this film.

Other reviewers have stated how clever the subtle pokes at American jingoism were. The pokes weren't subtle.

The theater was less than half full, dammit. I blame it on the children who would rather waste their time watching crap movies like ""shark tale"", dragging their poor yet stupid parents around.

Another extended South Park episode, ala Bigger, Longer and Uncut, with puppets. I'm glad I was mistaken. Don't get me wrong, it maintains the unique and brilliant sense of humour that you've come to expect from Stone & Parker, but Team America has something else, backbone. Laughing in the face of the current climate of America, it isn't afraid to mock the current Political code of ethics. Using the recent terrorist attacks as it's main subject matter, but never focusing on them for too long without deviating into the superb yet tasteless humour we've all come to know and love from the South Park franchise. With Kim Jong as the new Saddam, and a Hollywood A-Lister as America's answer to the threat of Global terrorism, this film has you laughing in all the right places, from the set gags to the poignant irony of it all, whilst never dwelling on one or the other for too long.

Team America successfully sends up action films , American Geopolitics and world view. Some is subtle and some not so subtle. If you've ever watched any major action film you'll recognise the ridiculous car chases, hi-explosives and silly dialogue. The political message is fairly blunt but some of the digs are fairly subtle irony. To understand this film I think you have to look at the American world view from outside America.

567,retro_racers,tip top film,10,9 January 2005,"hi, this film is ace. When you first start watching it, you feel that the marionettes may not work and that they may have made a bad decision to use them. After around 2 minutes you quickly realise that this is new ground and it seems a really fresh idea. I have just read that no computer help was use in any of the characters. There are many subtle gags throughout this film, a lot of which is in the way the characters are moved, this adds so much to it. I don't wish to reveal too much of the film as it may spoil the effect of that first precious look, so all i can say is to just make sure you give it a go. If you like dry British humour and full on action movies coupled with the magic humour of matt and trey then i gaurantee you will love this film. Watch it i beseech you.",Team America - World Police
568,itaintme,Whatever that was supposed to be,3,15 January 2005,"Now that I've seen this movie, I don't know what to make of it. What is it? Populist propaganda? Left-wing satire so subtle that it escaped my reasonably keen eye? If Parker/Stone wanted to insult everyone involved, they failed miserably. Sure, the demolition of the Louvre could be seen as a cultural criticism, the lack of regard for Arab culture might be considered satirized in the kind of way Team America handles Cairo. However... unlike the ""evil"" liberals, the right-wingers eventually succeed with their mindless mayhem and anyway are the ones who look much cooler. However, to portray Mike Moore (who I for one don't particularly like) as a ruthless killer and Hollywood actors as very rudely breaking the rule of ""Fighting for peace is like boozing for sobriety"" is just inaccurate and therefore not funny. The ""politically correct"" Manhattan culture business is contributing to this effect, although I did find this somewhat funny, especially in relation to the excellent soundtrack that caricatures many current Broadway musicals quite masterfully.The world portrayed in Team America is the world that the Bush campaign would have us believe we're living in. Although I did not hope to get sharply observed political satire that lashes out in all directions (as for instance in Billy Wilder's films), I did like South Park's approach and found this movie did NOT continue it. I'm not easily insulted, so I didn't mind the vulgar scenes. And the clichés seen in Hollywood movies are fantastically done, including the grimaces (people having would-be meaningful but in fact utterly superficial discussions about inner feelings, the ubiquitous childhood trauma, my favourite: head leant against a bus window covered with rain).If you like Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, posting on Usenet, or the New York Post, this is your movie. It has a weak UN, ruthless world-government type Hollywood stars and a team of heavily armed people who ""do the job"". If you really are into counting movie references, this is your movie. Otherwise, stay well clear and buy the soundtrack.3/10. Maybe I've missed the point after all?",Team America - World Police

Don't be put off by it being just puppets on strings as once you start to watch it you will just laugh your head off! If you liked south park and any other film which takes the mickey out of people and just plane insanity then this film is a must! the main parts of the film which are so funny are the start when they are trying to save the french from terrorists, when Gary (one of the characters) is singing in a Broadway musical the song is so hilarious, when they all travel to Egypt and try to sneak into find terrorists, and the end where Gary again talks about some very funny and unmissable crude insanity which he picks up on his way to fight for the good fight!!

But this film was just a plain disappointment. The jokes were cheap and I'm not really sure what the filmmakers tried to mock. The film had a very simple and not very sensitive way of making fun about actual persons. Normally I have nothing against politically incorrect films, but having the puppet of UN weapons instructor Hans Blix killed is just too much. I felt embarrassed having wasted my money on that stupid flick. I would really like to know what drove the inventors of funny Southpark to make this movie.

571,tero-10,"A film with puppets, thats about it",6,19 January 2005,"A film with puppets thats funny! Great I thought until i sat through it. Sadly for me this film failed to live up to the hype. The humour is very similar to Parker and Stone's previous effort 'South Park' there's really nothing new here. I have never been the biggest fan of south park and that is probably why i didn't enjoy it, I just wasn't the target audience. maybe its just me but I don't see how using swear words is supposed to make something funny. This film much like south park will insult anyone and anything. there are racial stereotypes galore, so if you are easily offended then I would suggest to stay away from this film.There was some redeeming factors to this film, between all the crude, childish humour there was actually some funny material. The movement of the puppets is hilarious and a few clever gags here and there almost made it worth the extortionate entrance fee. Its just a shame that the good jokes were few and far between. The only thing that made this film funny was the fact that it was puppets rather than actors. The fact that this film was never meant to be taken seriously is why they can get away with making it look so bad.My rating of 6 for this film I felt was just, there are enough good jokes to keep it enjoyable but the bulk of the film just wasn't up to scratch. If you want to see how it should be done than look no further than Dr. Strangelove.",Team America - World Police
572,sames-2,One of the funniest political films of all time!,10,13 February 2005,"This is perhaps the funniest film I've seen all year. Better than Bottle Rocket, better even than Spinal Tap. The fact that the actors are just a bunch of (amazingly manipulated) marionettes makes the whole thing even better. At first I thought it might be distracting, but really it's the only way to do this kind of satire other than animation. Think cheesy eighties Chuck Norris film to the max, complete with guest celebrities and fighter jets flying out of the heads on Mount Rushmore. In a not-so-subtle critique of the American way of dealing with things we see both the Eiffel tower and the Sphinx get destroyed in a matter of minutes by ""Team America"" all in the hope of ""stopping the terrorists."" It's brilliant. Oh, and the portrayal of Kim Jong Il... Watch this movie and imagine what it must have been like to be the North Korean translator that had to dub it so he could watch. There is one scene... And poor Matt Damon. This movie made me see him in a whole other light. Get the unrated version so you can see puppets having sex, even funnier than it sounds.

I heard it was as good as Southpark...damn it didn't even get close to that level! A puking, blowing and doggy-styling doll sound funny but it really wasn't funny to watch. Sure there were some funny moments but most of it was already been used so many times in other movies that it lost every effect. The only new element that was tried was to use dolls instead of real people and thats the only reason it is supposed to be funny, well i didn't think so. The balance in the movie is completely wrong some scenes were tried to keep real close to real live where other scenes are so over the top it itches.

Honestly, even if you hate these guys, u gotta be amazed that they can get away with some of the stuff they do-hopefully you think that is a good thing. We need to fight conservatism and these guys are perfect for that. These guys are geniuses to do what they!! This movie is even better than South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut!! I laughed my a$$ off the entire time. The ""love"" scene really caught me off guard and was a pleasant surprise. How can u go wrong with a movie that demolishes The Louve within the first 10 mins?!?!

Leave it to Matt Stone and Trey Parker to come up with something so fresh and far from the norms. Not only was it a complete success in it's ability to completely embarrass the stale comedy that has been polluting our public theaters and movie shelves for decades, but it actually used the fact that the actors were puppets to capture clumsy physical disabilities. The masters behind South Park didn't forget a single soul in Hollywood. If a celebrity wasn't in this film, they were still put to shame by the all-encompassing message that Hollwood actors and actresses are really nothing but tools, and we all ought to have a little fun realizing that their fame and fortune only makes them look more foolish. To top it off, Matt and Trey hired Bill Pope (cinematographer, ""The Matrix"") to shoot the film. These comic masters will never cease to amaze. GREAT FILM",Team America - World Police

As an comparative example, the ""Married With Children"" TV series also did this well, I thought.These guys are great and at the top of their game (even though they created South Park's ""Mr. Hanky"", a character that I hate with a passion that will never die...)In this film, there is something to amuse, disturb or disgust everyone, no matter what his/her political or social sentiments may be. I haven't laughed so consistently in any comedy I can recall, so this over-the-top film goes near the top of my all-time favorite comedy list, along with ""Stripes"", ""Caddyshack"", etc. Parenthetically, the alleged comedy ""Sideways"" is currently at the bottom of my comedy list.Technically, the marionette animation and miniature sets were all exceptionally well done, IMHO. I wonder how much they spent making this movie?Pseudo-spoiler: I also especially liked the speech at the end, which effectively and absurdly illustrates the conflicting impulses of War, Peace, and Justice in a civilized society, the solutions to which many well-meaning people vehemently disagree about.NOTE: If you're politically correct or overly sensitive about many issues, you probably shouldn't see this film.8/10, it was that good.",Team America - World Police

Well, this movie did not deliver any of what I expected.The so-called 'digs' weren't witty or funny. They were annoying at best.

So much of the film is tongue in cheek. As a politically aware woman with a college degree, I have to admit there was guilt involved at laughing at all that I did - honestly I can't believe Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually got away with some of it without being sued. The nice thing is that they make fun of everyone from Michael Moore to blind American patriotism - no one need feel left out.

I was initially sceptical about the cinematography of puppets having vehemently opposed watching Thunderbirds and Joe 90 as a youth, but in the capable hands of Matrix cinematographer (and legend) Bill Pope, it would have been rude not to give it a go...And I did.And I'm pleased I did.The lighting and camera shots are quite extraordinary and the viewer is convincingly teleported into the world of Team America, a distant climb from the strings and slapdash movements of the characters that coat the surface of this tasty little muffin of a film.In other words, I beg you, let any inhibitions about puppets or political morals have the night off and you will not stop laughing for the entire AIDS ridden frenzy (please see film to justify this comment).",Team America - World Police

This disgusting movie had every swear in the book including the C-Word, there was a seen where there was male puppet going down on another male puppet. There was also a sex seen where a male and female puppet were going at it doing moves that i never heard of before and some that i don't think any human being could do. I was on the other side of my king size water bed trying to cover my 14 year old and my 13 year old nieces eyes because i could not get to the clicker to turn it off.

It was so bad that my niece and my son had nightmares for a week an a half i kid you not. This movie was not worth the purchase one bit. I did not think that this movie was funny at all. In fact i don't even know how they could make an uncensored and unrated version of this movie. In my opinion i think that is impossible to do.

584,tetsu81,"Funny, politically cogent film.",8,8 August 2005,"South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone return to the big screen with Team America: World Police in an over the top and hilarious satire on world events and the debates raging over the war on terror.Parker and Stone manages to poke fun at almost everyone, including the U.S. by satirically showing the wanton disregard for the local population and what other people think as they go in and shoot up Paris and Egypt, perfectly illustrating the widely held cowboy mentality of American foreign policy. The film also captures the naïve sense of optimism and black and white triumphalism of American foreign policy when Team America tells the French ""everything is bon"" after destroying Paris. For Team America, the end justifies the means, and their job is to blow stuff up, police the world and catch terrorists.The two would later comment that they designed all the international sets to reflect what an American might think a place like Paris would look like, which meant a kind of Disney World version of the world. The Paris set for example had The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arch De Triumph in one small square. The cobblestone roads are made of croissant shaped stones and locations are described relative to their distance from America, showing the American inward looking self-centered attitude.Parker and Stone's politics have long been apparent in their work on South Park, spawning the term, South Park Conservatism. This new political movement is largely driven by young people who aren't wearing Che T-shirts and protesting the war in Iraq every time there is a meeting of world leaders. It can be loosely described as an opposition for political correctness, use of satire to mock established institutions and dearly held beliefs both on the left and the right, and the ridiculing of 'protected groups'. The purpose is usually to ridicule, mock and satirize the excesses and dysfunction of institutions that are often taboo to criticize.The film also includes a surprisingly insightful exchange between UN weapons inspector Hans Blix and Kim Jong-Il which skilfully illustrates the frustration many people have with the UN. In the exchange, Blix urges Kim Jong-Il to let him inspect Kim's palace for WMDs, ""or else"" Blix threatens. ""Or else what?"" Kim retorts. Blix's could only respond with complete seriousness the comically emasculated position of the real UN. ""or else we will be very angry with you and we will write a letter telling you how angry we are."" The fact that for the entire scene, Hans Blix isn't a caricature but portrayed sympathetically as a real UN bureaucrat urging Kim to let him so his job so he could ""ease the UN's collective minds"" makes the scene even more potent in its political analysis of the UN's current problems.The greatest achievement of the film is that in its nearly two hours of political satire, and especially with the speech comparing American hawks, peaceniks and pariah states with the human reproductive anatomy, the South Park creators have delivered a clear framework for their take on the world with amazing clarity and ironic insight, upstaging the various talking heads, politicians and pundits who have done essentially nothing but scream at each other over the past few years.The other part of the Team America focuses on Parker and Stone's satire of Michael Bay's action movies and their total loathing of actors (they later mentioned that they refused to hire real actors to do the voice work because they hate all actors which they feel are too self-absorbed in their own importance). There's several amazingly sung and composed satires of genre songs in the film, including the testosterone driven ""America, F*** YEAH!"" , country tune ""Freedom Isn't Free"" and Broadway musical ""Everyone Has Aids"" among other songs including one berating Michael Bay and Ben Affleck's abilities (largely deserved).The decision to split the film into a dual satire between politics and action movies, especially Parker and Stone's seemingly personal vendetta against a select group of actors ultimately hurts the film. Team America loses focus in the second half and never regains it until the final minutes of the film when Gary delivers an impassioned plea to world leaders, allowing Parker and Stone's point to get across. Whatever one's political position is, and assuming the viewer isn't too old or too socially conservative to find exploding heads, swearing and puppet sex socially corrupt, Team America: World Police is a great film that delivers one of the most politically cogent post-911 world views that I've seen, read or heard anywhere. There is no room for apologists, vitriolic rants against certain countries or sensitivities for feelings of some minorities, they tell it like they see it and it works.",Team America - World Police

The action scene were very well done especially for puppeting. Love scenes were hilarious and normally I don't care for movies with a lot of vulgarity but this was done so humoursly it was never offensive. It was Young Frankenstein meets South Park meets the Thunderbirds! Definitely NOT for children, but some great adult humor. Good character development.

I do find it an impressive achievement that they did not rely on computers to add to the content of the movie. Unfortunately, that does not excuse the lack of creative thought and attention to what an audience may actually desire; a comedy. To subject them to a puppet drama with limited scope of thought seems to be a bit of a travesty.

There was also a sex scene in the uncut version which was funny in the beginning and then got downright disgusting. Once again the creators of South Park disappoint.

Easy jokes repeated ad nauseam until even my table could get the point, swearing and sexual humour used to excess and where the most obvious idea came to mind - yes, you can bet the production team hung on to it and rode it like a Derby winner.Aimed at 9 year old boys who chuckle every time the 'F' word is used, the movie could be a smash, but I sadly expected a bit more.It lacked the charisma of Billy Connolly's constant swearing, the simplicity of South Park and the originality of The Simpsons.It was pointless, hackneyed mind cancer and I hated every second of it.",Team America - World Police

Don't bother watching it if your aren't in the mood to laugh because it'll make you cringe and the stupidity n you will absolutely hate it and wont understand why everyone else loves it. I must admit the ending was a bit disappointing the way it just stopped but you can get over that when you remember how much time you sat there just hysterically laughing. The songs are star work! a gotta see movie!... but when you're in the right mood.,Team America - World Police
597,louiscarrier,A Perfect Comedy,10,12 February 2019,"Team America is one of the rare movies which had me laughing from beginning to end, even in it's emotional scene. This is due to the movie's utter ridiculousness which is one of its greatest strength. The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is also quite reminiscent of director Trey Parker's previous work with South Park which is a comedy tv show praised for not taking itself seriously either, as well as being offensive towards everyone in order to create a brilliant comedy, which people from everywhere can enjoy. The puppetry is also a great addition, and they vary from being hilariously inexpressive to overly emotional. Overall I think that Team America is an example on how a (rude) comedy should be like.",Team America - World Police
598,finchmw,so many honest laughs,8,28 December 2005,"This movie was so right on about the arrogant nature of the Hollywood self proclaimed elite. I only wish that they would have added a few more to the cast, including our good friend Barbara S. and a few more out of touch people. Thanks you guys for a wonderful movie. Its now my job as a parent to make sure my children know who the true traitors to the facts are in our world. F.A.G. film actors exposed. my daughter in law is too stupid to get it, yes she is an idiot. The country is full of uninformed people like her that can't think a little for themselves. I also was impressed with the idea that you can be quite destructive making mistakes trying to stop terror. The scene in France was great because I can't think of a better place to have a few missiles go arye. The scene with the tower falling is pure comedy. the effects were great. The look on the people after they were saved by Team America was priceless. I also am happy that Phil Hendrie was used as a voice in the movie, (Intellegence) and as a mid east anti Infidel. He is a Star in exposing Idiots. His Radio show continues to grow in leaps and bounds due to true Infidels like my daughter in law. Loved the foreign languages in the movie also, very realistic non sense jargon. I am still laughing. thanks",Team America - World Police
599,ymamacitya69,Totally Hilarious,10,15 February 2006,"This movie is hilarious and extremely creative. I wish they would come out with another!There are many times when I find myself quoting the characters from this movie. The props used added comedy to the scenes. This movie is very vulgar and somewhat offensive when it comes to AIDS, race, and a few other subjects but as in South Park it touches many subjects in everyday life and finds a way to make them irresistibly funny. If you love South Park or Drawn Together you'll love this movie! I didn't believe there was a dull moment in this movie and the action sequences although unreal were fantastically done with fire, fighting, racing, everything. The sex scene was also very interesting beyond words. This is a movie I'm glad I didn't miss and that I don't mind watching over and over again.",Team America - World Police

If you have a childish sense of humour, which I do.If you someone with a more mature sense of humour, then this film might not be as appealing.I love this movie and would put it in my top 10 films.Definitely A bundle of laughs. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone(has AIDS) **** - 4 stars. Not quite a 5 star film. But still highly enjoyableAnyone who has doubts should buy this or rent it!Good bye",Team America - World Police
