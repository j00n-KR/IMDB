0,Leofwine_draca,Efficient and unpleasant update,7,20 April 2012,"The Hollywood remakes continue unabated with this redo of the notorious Wes Craven shocker from 1972 which involves a couple of teenage girls falling foul of a criminal gang and the violent consequences that ensue. The Wes Craven film remains chilling to this day for its low budget, grainy look and feel which gives it a fuzzy, could-almost-be-a-snuff-movie type vibe. This remake is, inevitably, bigger and slicker, with more explosive action and high-end camera-work. It may not be as downright disturbing as Craven's movie but as remakes go it's one of the better ones out there.The imposing Garret Dillahunt stars as Krug, the leader of a criminal family, for whom kidnapping, rape, extortion and murder are the order of the day. The scenes in which he captures the two girls and then subjects them to a horrendous ordeal within the woods is still a powerfully shocking moment, although thankfully it doesn't go into as much unpleasant detail as in the Craven movie. The scene then shifts to the titular location, which for me is where the film really gets going: it's all about the suspense inherent in waiting for the parents to find out what happened and then watching what they do about it, the classic home invasion premise.What ensues both delights and disappoints. There's a violent and lengthy scene in which a character is attacked which really pays off, but aside from that what follows is a little disappointing – not least the tacked-on ending involving a microwave, which takes the mildly realistic events of the previous movie and trashes them with a frankly outrageous and unbelievable gore scene.The cast is pretty good, which seems to be the norm for these modern-day remakes (aside from the teen slashers, in which the cast remain drivelling). Dillahunt excels in the role which made David Hess's name; he's no Hess, but he gets close at times. Tony Goldwyn, previously a villain in the likes of THE LAST SAMURAI, is particularly good as the father caught up in events spiralling out of control, although Monica Potter as the mother has little to work with. Yes, there are a couple of unwise twists where the plot deviates from the original – and horror fans will be disappointed there's no chainsaw this time around – but for the most part this is a workable suspense thriller with enough viciousness to appease moviegoers looking for their latest violent fix.",The Last House on the Left
1,SnoopyStyle,memorable brutality,6,10 October 2015,"A gang kills two detectives and breaks out criminal Krug (Garret Dillahunt). Competitive swimmer Mari Collingwood (Sara Paxton) and her parents (Monica Potter, Tony Goldwyn) go to their vacation home. Mari reconnects with local friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac). The girls go to a motel room with Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) with the promise of some marijuana. They have a fun time until Justin's dad Krug, uncle Francis (Aaron Paul) and Sadie (Riki Lindhome) arrive. The girls are kidnapped and then Mari causes the car to crash.As far as violent horrors go, this works better than most. The first half is the most compelling. The rape scene is pretty brutal. The violence is scary without the enjoyable fun. It's a horrific scene. The scariest part is actually the motel scene where the violence is just threatened. The second half is less scary by comparison. It's more traditional with the Collingwood family battling the criminal family. The whole movie works pretty well with some memorable brutality.",The Last House on the Left
2,claudio_carvalho,Unforgettable Vacation,6,25 October 2009,"While being transported by two detectives in a car, the dangerous criminal Krug (Garret Dillahunt) is rescued by his brother Francis (Aaron Paul) and his girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome), and they brutally kill the detectives. Meanwhile Emma (Monica Potter), her husband Dr. John (Tony Goldwyn) and their seventeen year-old daughter Mari Collingwood (Sara Paxton) head on vacation to their house nearby the lake. Mari borrows the family car to meet her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac) that is working in a store in the town. They befriend the teenager Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) in the store and he offers some marijuana to the pothead Paige in the motel where he is lodged. While they are smoking grass in Justin's room, Krug, who is Justin's father, Francis and Sadie arrive and abduct the girls. Krug drives Mari's car and she provokes a crash on a tree. Krug stabs Paige and rapes Mari; however Mary manages to escape, swimming in the lake, but Krug shots her on the back. They walk through the isolated road in the woods and they reach Collingwood's house telling that they have just had a car accident. Emma and John welcome the strangers until they discover what happened to their beloved daughter. ""The Last House on the Left"" is a good remake of the 1972 Wes Craven's tale of revenge. This thriller is very violent and the rape scene is very realistic. However, the storyline is indeed an updated version of 1960 Ingmar Bergman's ""Jungfrukällan"" that takes place in the Fourteenth Century in Sweden, i.e., a virgin that is raped by a gang that seeks shelter in her parent's home, and her father revenges the death of his beloved daughter. Unfortunately I did not see any credit to the original writer Ulla Isaksson. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Última Casa"" (""The Last House"")",The Last House on the Left
3,kosmasp,Wild Things,6,12 August 2009,"If you have seen Wes Cravens Original exploitation movie from the 70s, you won't be surprised. Not story-wise nor specific-scene wise (especially one scene that will leave you disgusted or at least should leave you that way).While many tag the Horror movie button on this movie, it actually isn't. It is a psychological thriller, as was the Wes Craven original. Just because it is brutal and bloody, doesn't mean it's Horror. That's how I feel about the movie. The tension and the suspense that get build up, are all factors for that.You have some pretty good actors in the movie. A pretty good take overall, some minor changes to the original, but a movie that just leaves you with a bitter taste ...",The Last House on the Left
4,gavin6942,A Remake That Brings A Classic Horror Film Up to Date,7,14 March 2009,"Mari Collingwood and her friend Paige meet a nice young man named Justin. Unfortunately, while Justin seems friendly enough, his father and uncle are not so nice. What ensues is a brutal assault... followed up with a family's desire to get revenge. Based strongly on the 1972 original.2009 is shaping up to be the year of the remake. That worries me... is Hollywood out of ideas? Are they going to kill my childhood memories? But oddly enough, so far they seem to be doing fine. ""Friday the 13th"" was better than expected for me, and ""Last House on the Left"" sticks very faithfully to the original, only really making minor adjustments for the time (this is over thirty years later, after all).We have now the necessary shot of the cell phone without signal. But also, we have a much more ambiguous Mari. In the original, she was very pure, albeit a casual drug user. Now it's not so clear. Sure, she's an athlete and the pride of her family, but she gives the audience a few tease moments, suggesting she's a sexual creature. This, of course, does nothing to make the following events more acceptable.Some other variations follow, including weapons of choice... who lives and dies, and the inclusion of another person into the plot that wasn't around for the original. While the rape here is brutal, the revenge sequences are perhaps tame compared to the original. So, you have a bit of a toss-up for where they push the envelope.Overall, I was pleased with this film. I enjoyed the way they brought us a classic horror tale in modern times, and the casting was excellent. Not only is the director largely unknown, so are all the actors (except Monica Potter). So this adds a sense of realism that may not have been there with, say, Scout Taylor-Compton or other young starlet. Thank you for this casting. I do not regret going to see this in the theater, and I would encourage you to do so, as well, particularly if you liked the original. They did well.",The Last House on the Left
5,rmax304823,Sex and Violence.,3,21 July 2010,"There must be an audience for this meretricious trash but I guess I'm not one of the members. Revenge movies have their place in literature and film. ""The Merchant of Venice"" is propelled by carelessness and revenge. If you spit on Shylock's gabardines, you wind up paying your pound of flesh.In movies, Ingemar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" has a plot similar to ""The Last House on the Left,"" only it has a more sophisticated point of view. In Bergman's movie, there are a trio of evildoers who rape and murder Max Von Sydow's daughter and then, unwittingly, spend the night in Von Sydow's house. When he finds out what the men have done, Von Sydow takes a ritual sweat bath to cleanse himself, then slaughters all of the miscreants.In both movies, there is a dim-witted young kid who doesn't commit any violent acts and, in fact, may not approve of it and suffer some chagrin afterward. In Bergman's story, this not-too-bright kid is seen pathetically shoveling a few handfuls of dirt to cover up the young girl's violated body.But Von Sydow kills them all while they are helpless at his dinner table. In ""Last House on the Left,"" the original rape and murder are simply an excuse for more violence -- more dragged out, more explicit, more brutal, and finally just plain silly. There's blood all over the place and the head of the vengeful household sticks the head of the paralyzed and terrified chief rapist and murderer into a microwave oven and fries it until it explodes.When the brain pops out, the audience is supposed to flood out with joy, as if this were a comic tale designed for five-year-olds which, in a way, is exactly what it is. There is no relief when Von Sydow finishes his awesome task. There is relief at the resolution of the story in favor of a fundamentally good man, but there is discomfort too. His victims didn't fight back as they do here. And, after all, the dumb kid was technically innocent of being anything other than a frightened witness. Did he deserve to die? Was it Von Sydow's job to see that he did? To see that ANY of them did? No such ambiguity here. The stupid younger guy is wounded with a poker (by his malignant father) but survives to be taken to a hospital.I'm beginning to wonder, in view of some of the schlock appearing on screens these days, whether there is a pornography of torture. I presume there is and that there always has been. Grand Guignol was nothing but violence and murder. Even Shakespeare descended into the abattoir for ""Titus Andronicus."" What's bothersome, I guess, is that in movies the violence can be seen and relished in lengthy close ups. Here we see a man push a knife into the belly of a bound, half-naked girl. He removes the knife. We see the blood beginning to ooze from the open slit. Then, with a smile, he slowly inserts the knife into another part of her lower belly and we get to see him gripping the handle firmly as the blade slides into her body. When it's removed, there is another pair of hideous bleeding lips.I don't find that fun. I don't find it enthralling. I find it barely watchable and I think it's there to appeal to the basest impulses of the basest members of the audience.",The Last House on the Left
6,ma-cortes,Extremely violent remake with sadistic scenes and repulsive crimes,6,2 October 2010,"This rendition based on Wes Craven's film debut is a modern little production that rises above its unsettling plot , passable production values and via its grimly affecting portrait of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted from ¨Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring ¨, but the movie has more in common with ¨Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs¨ as it charts the descent of a harmless married couple (Tony Goldwyn , Monica Potter) into methodical killers . A quartet of criminals -a distorted version of the nuclear family , a sadistic Manson type group- kidnaps a pair of teenage girls (Sara Paxton, Marta MacIsaac) and proceeds to ravage, rape, and finally brutally torture them in the forest , unwittingly within walking distance of their rural house . The murderers take refuge in the one girls' own home, only to meet even sterner justice , as when the parents discover just who they are and what they have done, they plot violent vendetta , taking a peculiar retribution .This remake produced by Craven and Sean S. Cunningham is a sleek production with average budget and packs genuine chills , suspense , repugnant scenes, tension , and shocks , it's a terror-thriller very exciting . Gory, gruesome , pretty repellent , extremely violent and unrelenting shock-feast laced with the avenging theme . The film is paced with intelligent edition , special use of color and slick utilization of shock images that take place in the astonishing close-up crimes . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie , the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point . This one is another adaptation based on horror classics of the 70s and 80s, such as ¨Halloween ¨, ¨ 13 Friday ¨, ¨Nightmare in Elm Street and ¨My bloody Valentine¨, among others , all being recently remade in modern style . The unsettling scenes and action are accompanied with adequate musical score by composer John Murphy. Director Greek Dennis Illiadis redefines the classic horror picture with this his second film , being the first titled ¨Hardcore¨ , another strong story dealing with Greek prostitutes . The movie portrays modern society crumbling into terror and madness . Illiadis gives his film an uncomfortable verisimilitude , setting it squarely in the heartland of modern America . While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting interludes, his handling of the cruel horror scenes is disgusting, and with brief unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moments in the beginning . Rating : 6,5 ; acceptable remake full of violent frames as well as the original . Humiliation images and graphic torture rate this one a ¨R¨ at best , avoid squeamish people because it will probably turn their stomach .",The Last House on the Left
7,BA_Harrison,One of the better remakes in recent years.,7,18 July 2009,"Two teenage girls, Mari (Sara Paxton) and Paige (Martha MacIsaac), fall foul of a murderous family led by despicable escaped killer Krug (Garret Dillahunt). When the ruthless gang seek refuge from a storm at a remote lakeside house, little do they realise that the couple who offer them shelter are the parents of one of the girls.One of the tag-lines for Wes Craven's 1972 The Last House On The Left reads 'Mari, seventeen, is dying. Even for her the worst is yet to come'; it may come as a surprise for fans of that film, therefore, to learn that Dennis Iliadis's 2009 remake doesn't see young Mari buying the farm: she survives despite receiving both a severe kicking and a bullet in the back.This is just one of several changes that have been made to Craven's story in an effort to bring his gruelling revenge tale to a new audience, and the result is something of a mixed bag; whilst some of these modifications undeniably help to flesh out and drive the plot in a more logical and believable fashion, other changes feel like a bit of a 'cop-out' and only serve to drain the remake of some of the immense emotional power that made the original such a harrowing experience.With Mari still alive by the closing credits, Iliadis's film cannot hope to rival the power of Craven's brutal shocker, which capitalised on its audience's strong primal desire to see her terrible death avenged by her bereaved parents. Also, the director's reluctance to include some of the original's more exploitative moments also weakens the movie's overall impact (the 'name carving', 'intestine fondling', and 'bloody blow job' scenes are no longer present, and the harrowing rape of Mari is now notable for its lack of nudity). On the flip-side, the modified script, by Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth, no longer sees Krug and Co. arriving at Mari's home completely by accident (something that always took some swallowing), does away with the comedy cops that many found off-putting, introduces a sympathetic character to Krug's family, and still delivers enough general sadism and nastiness to be worthy of its infamous title.",The Last House on the Left
8,paul_haakonsen,There were other houses?,5,26 March 2011,"Not having see the 1972 version, though familiar with it, I had no expectations to this 2009 re-make. Well, that isn't entirely true though, usually re-makes tend to be a somewhat doubtful affair and end up with questionable results. But not having seen the 1972 version, I got nothing to draw comparison with.This 2009 version was a good movie in itself, though I had expected it was a horror movie, not a drama/thriller. But the movie was entertaining nonetheless.The story told in ""The Last House on the Left"" is about some people kidnapping, assaulting and molesting two young girls and leaving them for dead. Then the assailants seek refuge in a home for the storm, and it turns out to be the home of one of the assaulted teenagers. I am not telling more about the story, because that would be ruining it all for you.As for the title of the movie, then I would have expected the movie to take place in some rural or suburban setting, not in an isolated forested region. But hey, don't judge a book by its cover, eh? The cast in ""The Last House on the Left"" was fairly good, and the movie was carried by the performances of Garret Dillahunt (playing Krug), Tony Goldwyn (playing John), Monica Potter (playing Emma) and finally Sara Paxton (playing Mari). The other people on the cast list did a good job as well, just that these four people were the ones carrying the movie on their shoulders.In terms of scary moments, then there weren't really any in the movie to scare me. Sure there were some tense moments and that were building up suspense, but never a moment where you were scared. The movie plays on psychological fear and it does so well enough.One thing that didn't go well for me in the movie was the lack of lighting. The movie was shot mostly in darkness or hardly-lit conditions and it brought the movie experience down a notch. It made it seem like a typical horror movie set from the mid 80's.""The Last House on the Left"" provided good entertainment, but for me it didn't have enough value for a second viewing. I suppose having seen the original version might have been good, then there would have been a foundation for comparison.The ending of the movie seemed like it was something thrown together on the day of the actual shoot. It was not working well to close up an otherwise exciting movie. And that was a shame.",The Last House on the Left
9,edwagreen,Last House on Left-You Can Make A Right Turn on this One **1/2,5,28 June 2010,"I've enjoyed Tony Goldwyn's acting since I saw him in the memorable ""Ghost"" of 1990 fame.I found it quite unusual that the good doctor, Goldwyn, has a propensity for using profanity. He certainly doesn't let a situation go by where he doesn't use it.The picture goes down in quality as the horror mounts. It becomes a running game of who can provide more torture, the doctor and his wife or the 4 miscreants who have invaded their home after shooting their daughter and knifing her girlfriend to death.The film shows that when pushed to the edge, decent people can become animals in their reactions. The killing scenes were gory and gruesome to say the least.",The Last House on the Left
10,Coventry,Respectable remake,7,28 April 2009,"Regardless of your own personal opinions and sentiments, there are just certain movies you simply have to acknowledge as genuine milestones for the commotion they caused upon their release, the trends they launched in contemporary cinema and even the whole generations of younger writers/directors they influenced. Wes Craven's original 1972 film ""Last House on the Left"" is such a movie, even though – theoretically speaking – that milestone itself was already a remake of Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"". Personally I prefer some of the imitations much more, like ""House on the Edge of the Park"" and ""I Spit on your Grave"" just to name two of them, but I will never deny that ""Last House on the Left"" is still the most powerful and prominent. That is also exactly the overall impression I received from this new and reasonably well-marketed remake by the unknown (at least to me) director Dennis Iliadis. The remake addresses younger target groups and transfers an old story into a new setting, but it seemingly never aspires anything more. Most remakes like, say, ""Halloween"" or ""Black Christmas"", are exceedingly bombastic on the outside but substantially void. This new version of ""Last House "" arguably softened the subject material a little – especially in the sleaze & savagery departments – but it nevertheless remained a bona fide horror movie that respects the intellect of its audience rather than to distract them with boisterous effects and outrageous choreography. I never at one point got the impression that this production tried to surpass or even equalize with the original, and that's a good thing because the typically grim 70's atmosphere and aura of exploitative weirdness simply cannot be surpassed! The script is rudimentary and straightforward: a married couple and their teenage daughter – who already had to deal with the loss of their son and brother last year – head out to their woods-surrounded holiday resort in the countryside. The girl, Mary, goes out with a local friend named Paige, but they fall into the hands of three fugitive criminals of who the leader (Krug) is a stoic and relentless killer. Paige is killed but Mary is humiliated, molested and left for dead in the river. The trio of thugs subsequently seeks shelter in the house of Mary's parents, unaware of the familial link there is with the girl they just killed. Director Dennis Iliadis' job definitely wasn't an easy one, because Craven's original film is so commonly known and widely acclaimed. The controversy and element of surprise have entirely vanished by now and thus the only trumps Iliadis has left to work with are shocks, suspense and slaughter. He clearly felt too restrained to use these trumps during the scenes covering teenage rape and misogynist violence, but the retaliation sequences are pretty damn fantastic. The last half hour of the movie is exaggeratedly barbaric, with some excessive bits of gore and bloodshed. The metamorphosis of the characters occurs somewhat abrupt and implausible (especially melancholic-faced Monica Potter isn't very convincing as a maniacal avenger), the newly added characters (like the rapist's teenage son with a conscience) are utterly redundant and the finale is cheaply sentimental, but still all of these are forgivable defaults that get widely compensated by the carnage. Garret Dillahunt is adequate as Krug, although he obviously can't hold a candle to cult-favorite David Hess who immortalized the stereotype of perverted rapist in the original and remained associated with that character for the rest of his career.",The Last House on the Left
11,michaelRokeefe,Well made graphic remake.,8,16 March 2009,"A contemporary remake of Wes Craven's controversial 1972 shocker.

Very tense, but gratifying. Also in the cast: Riki Lindhome, Aaron Paul, Martha Macisaac, Michael Bowen and Spencer Treat Clark.",The Last House on the Left
12,hitchcockthelegend,Lake Ends In The Road.,7,1 November 2013,"The Last House on the Left is directed by Dennis Iliadis and adapted to screenplay by Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth from the story by Wes Craven (co-producer here). A remake of Craven's 1972 film of the same name (itself influenced by Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring), it stars Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, Garret Dillahunt, Sara Paxton, Spencer Treat Clark and Martha MacIsaac. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Sharone Meir.During a family vacation, teenagers Mari (Paxton) and Paige (MacIsaac) are viciously set about by a gang led by recent prison escapee Krug (Dillahunt). When bad weather forces Krug's car to career off the road, the gang, unbeknownst to them, seek refuge in the vacation home of Mari's parents. When the parents realise what their new lodgers have done, they begin to enact bloody retribution.It's pointless going on about remakes of old horror films, they are here to stay and we continue to watch them in the hope that they will strike a chord with us. With The Last House on the Left, remaking it, to me at least, is understandable given the 72 film is not exactly a great classic itself. True enough to say it has that grainy grunginess that was so befitting the decade's horror movies, marking it out as an unsettling experience without really living up to its ""terrifying"" reputation. In fact if you put both movies together they still wouldn't have enough class in them to give Bergman's movie a run for its money.So the remake then, all glossy and big budgeted, with name actors in the principal roles, it is by definition routinely packaged for the modern day audience. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that what unfolds on that screen is challenging us, it really does do its job. The pertinent question exists, are you capable of such violence having had violence inflicted on your loved ones previously? What would you do in the same situation that Mari's parents find themselves in?We have been privy to what was meted out to poor Mari and Paige, and the impact is most distressing. There is good cause to argue that Iliadis and his production team go too far in grabbing our attention in readiness for the ""revenge"" factor later on. Certainly I myself was uncomfortable watching it, as I was with the I Spit on Your Grave remake, but it's about getting a prescribed response, however close to the knuckle it is.It's not a film anyone can feel comfortable about recommending, surely? But I know it put me through a gamut of emotions, even making me feel bad about myself the next day. That is quite often the power of cinema, and clearly the banner that Craven and Iliadis held aloft during the publicity tours for The Last House on the Left. Today I give the film an uneasy 7/10, it's uncompromising and unapologetically violent, but also laced with flaws. On another day I may find myself rating it considerably lower",The Last House on the Left
13,Scarecrow-88,Last House on the Left,5,4 April 2009,"I can just imagine LHotL purists balking in disgust as the new remake unfolds, how the horrifying rape of a beautiful, sweet-hearted virginal teenager at the hands of the muscular, intimidating brute Krug is ""tamed down"" and how her pot-smoking friend is stabbed only once in the back and once in the stomach(..compared to the multiple stabbings in the original), left to die, how the camera work and lead performances of her parents, Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter, are of a higher quality, how the violence is ratcheted up in extreme fashion at the end when revenge is sought against the thugs, how John Collingwood is made a knowledgeable surgeon whose expertise come into use to save his daughter, how the character of Mari Collingwood is a talented swimmer appropriate especially when she escapes her attackers. It's all in the details. The idea that Goldwyn's John Collingwood is a surgeon is a plot point specifically designed to save his daughter. His daughter's swimming ability is a plot point to save herself even when she's shot by Krug. The rape is carefully shot where you see no penetration, mostly just poor Sara Paxton's face as her Mari is molested and mistreated. The film allows her to get shots at the female member of Krug's brood, Sadie(Riki Lindhome;HACK!)a car cigarette lighter and a heavy stone. The brood themselves are rather colorless, not as ""white trash"" or ugly as the original film's nasty villains.Garret Dillahunt is nowhere even close to as imposing as David Hess in the original as Krug(..but those shoes couldn't be filled by anyone)with the actor(..despite being athletically built, tall, and handsome) lacking that extra edge and presence needed for this particular role. Aaron Paul, as Krug's wild-eyed, explosive brother Francis, looks the part of an unhinged thug, but lacks the quiet intimidating presence of Fred J Lincoln's Fred 'Weasel' Podowski(..just the way Weasel toyed with his knife, is more creepy than anything Aaron Paul does in the entire movie). Riki Lindhome is simply a bitch, not the ""anything goes"" Sadie, Jeramie Rain portrayed with chilling realism in the original. But, there's no doubt that Potter and Goldwyn are far and away superior in the roles of the devastated and deeply wounded parents in the remake. Their breakdown in realizing that they had just provided comfort to the very thugs who raped and harmed their daughter runs rings around the performances of Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr in the original.The grisly rampage of violence is the major difference between the two. The protracted revenge lasts quite a bit longer in the remake, with superior effects and nastier attacks(..the use of a garbage disposal and microwave provide rather interestingly brutal results)where a fireplace poker, hammer, butcher knife, and handgun all play important roles in how people are punished. I do believe director Dennis Iliadis does, at times, attempt to shoot the actions of characters in ways similar to how Craven did in his film, but there's certainly a polish and accomplished look that the remake has due to the much larger budget(..a luxury Crave didn't have when making his little exploitation shocker). And, this film adheres to the criticisms often made towards Craven's version..NO COMEDY. This film is dead serious from start to finish and his straight forward, full steam ahead. Actions are in place, choices are made, and the carnage ensues. This wasn't made in the 70's and feels every bit the modern slasher variation Craven's film wasn't..this will be a problem for LHotL faithful. The depth is removed and there's no hostile Vietnam era undercurrents at the heart..Iliadis' film is set in the now and simply displays two teenagers going along with the wrong young man, even though he's a baby-faced gentle lamb(Spencer Treat Clark, as Krug's oft-abused son, Justin, a handsome kid who looks positively nothing like the freakish Marc Sheffler), paying the price when the kid's dangerous family arrives on them unannounced. I think a modern audience might just enjoy this remake, but I do feel that the unabashed vocal supporters of the original will hate it. I was quite surprised to see Paxton in this film, having noticed her in Disney fare before, because the poor girl goes through hell. The survival of Paxton's Mari is quite a change from the original(..how she could still swim back home with an embedded and bleeding bullet wound, also serves as a reason to lament)and might provide even more disgust with purists who stand by the power of a murdered daughter and how that kind of emotional loss would properly engage such a negative reaction towards revenge. My favorite scene would probably be when Francis' nose is reset and stitched by John, only to be broken again later.",The Last House on the Left
14,Hey_Sweden,"An intense, well executed remake.",6,25 January 2013,"If you've seen the landmark 1972 Sean S. Cunningham / Wes Craven film that shares this title, you'll know what to expect, but for newcomers it tells the story of a quartet of repulsive criminal scum who humiliate and defile two teen aged girls only to meet savage justice from the parents of one of the girls.And this version, scripted by Adam Alleca & Carl Ellsworth and directed by Dennis Iliadis, does stick pretty close to the earlier Wes Craven script. It trims some of the fat, namely, the comedy relief with the bumbling Keystone Cop characters, but at the same time extends the story a little too much; this runs about a half hour longer than the 1972 film.The Cunningham / Craven production may have had its problems, but it's still a leaner, meaner beast, and it's the very crudeness of the film that adds to its raw and brutal impact. What we get this time is something very studio-slick and overall not as memorable, although it does feature an appropriately odious rape sequence. Where it falters is in a change made from the '72 film: this tale doesn't get quite as dark, and gives the parents questionable motivation in turning as bloodthirsty as they get.The production values are first rate, with very impressive production design by Johnny Breedt and cinematography by Sharone Meir. The music by John Murphy is good but it's just not the same as the music composed by David A. Hess, the 1972 Krug; the composition ""Wait for the Rain"" is sorely missed. It helped in creating a very 70s vibe for the original.The actors this time around are well cast, especially Garret Dillahunt as ringleader Krug, Riki Lindhome as Sadie, and Sara Paxton as the smart and feisty Mari. Lindhome succeeds at being as ""animal like"" as Jeramie Rain. Dillahaunt is a pretty scary villain; he's just not going to make anyone forget the late David Hess, who was one of the big screens' great actors when it comes to utter depravity. Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter are solid as the vengeance crazed parents, and Spencer Treat Clark is good as Justin, Krugs' son who is the one member of the gang with anything resembling a conscience. Aaron Paul, however, is no Fred Lincoln.All things considered, this is reasonably entertaining in a very visceral way, with some nice atmosphere (this was actually shot in South Africa!) and some juicy gore. As modern remakes go, it's not bad at all. The coda, featuring a bit with a microwave, is pretty damn silly, though.Six out of 10.",The Last House on the Left
15,preppy-3,Terrible acting and writing sink this one,3,17 March 2009,"**SPOILERS** Two teenage girls--Mari (Sara Paxton) and Paige (Martha MacIsaac)--are tortured, raped and killed by a sadistic gang led by Krug (Garret Dillahunt). They include his son Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), his brother Francis (Aaron Paul) and bisexual Sadie (Riki Lindhome). They end up staying in the home of Mari's parents (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter). Also Mari has survived her attack and gets to her parents. They, in turn, torture and kill Krug and his gang.OK--I thought the original was a sick degrading film...but it DID do its job (scare the hell out of you). It was made on no budget and had a documentary style feel to it making it hard to shake off. Also some of the acting was good and TOO realistic. Naturally this unnecessary remake screws everything up.It's glossy and professionally made so you're always aware you're watching a movie. They also cut down on the torturing of the girls (I'm saying that as a good thing). However the acting is so bad it's hard to take this seriously. Paxton and MacIsaac are just dreadful--although MacIsaac DOES try. Paxton was always blank--always! Even when she's being raped she doesn't react! (By the way, the rape is tastefully done--there's no nudity and (to me at least) it was obviously being faked. Dillahunt is just as bad as Krug. David Hess in the original was ugly, mean and downright frightening. Dillahunt looks great (he's even all pumped up) and looks as frightening as a cover boy from a fashion magazine. The same goes with all of the gang--they look too good to be convincing. Their wretched acting doesn't help. I thought with Potter and Goldwyn we'd have some good acting. Nope. They easily give their worst performances. Everybody here is so lifeless it's hard to give a damn about anything.The writing doesn't help. The lines are stupid and the script dull. Also did you know a microwave oven works with its door wide open??? According to this movie it does! Right there the writers are showing their total contempt for the audience by throwing in idiotic things like that. Add that to the pathetic acting and you have one hard movie to sit through. This gets three stars only because of the end when Krug and his gang get killed. The blood and gore comes barreling out and leads to some very gruesome and cool murders. But, unless you're a gore fan, you're going to find very little here. If you want to see it just for the gore wait till it comes out on DVD and just fast forward to the last 40 minutes. Another unnecessary horror movie redo.",The Last House on the Left

While driving along Mari tries to get away & causes a crash, stuck in the wood alone Krug & his gang abuse & torture the girls & afterwards seek shelter at a nearby home which just happens to be Mari's lakeside cabin where her parents are...Directed by Dennis Iliadis this is a remake of the early Wes Craven exploitation rape revenge flick The Last House on the Left (1972) which was actually a very loose remake itself of The Virgin Spring (1960), there has been a recent trend in Hollywood to remake classic horror films (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, The Fog, Halloween, Friday the 13th to name but some) & some people just don't like remakes by their very definition but I have to say I don't have a problem with them & it's quite often the case that I have found the remake to be just as good if not better than the original & while this modern The Last House on the Left isn't quite as effective as the original it's still a pretty good film & almost on par with the original. The film basically follows the original fairly closely & doesn't deviate too much although some of the character names have been changed, some of the character's who died in the original survive here (in one case it hurts the film badly), all of the death scenes are different, the pacing is very different & there's far more build up & attempted character development. The original The Last House on the Left focused on the kidnapping, torture, rape & murder of the girls while this one doesn't dwell on it too much & the original didn't spend too much time on the revenge part of the plot as justice was swift & brutal whereas here a lot longer is spent with the Collingwood's revenge against their daughter's attackers. As a film in it's own right it's pretty good, the story is engaging enough, there's enough to shock & disturb & it does what it sets out to do. Some of the exposition is wasted & the events are more black and white than in the original, the villains are horrible scum who deserve to die while the Collingwood's are whiter than white & deserve their revenge. I liked it overall & think it's a more accessible film than the original that modern audiences might appreciate more.The original was shot on grainy film by inexperienced filmmakers & that gave it a gritty cheap & exploitative look while this was funded by a major Hollywood studio so it looks infinitely more polished which I think works against it. The rape scene isn't as graphic as some might say & while it's there on screen it's not dwelt upon, the whole capture of the girls & what happens to them is condensed & toned down which may be a relief to some. There's some gore here too, there's a stabbing, a few gory shootings, someone gets a hammer in the back of their head & a rather silly out of keeping exploding head in a microwave. There's a nice dark unpleasant tone running throughout the film which is nice & I could see this getting under more sensitive viewers skins. I just saw this in a cinema (with a whole four other people) & the presentation was atrocious, the print was horrible & dark with virtually no definition & the fight at the end was rendered pointless as I couldn't see who was who just these black outlines fighting each other.This was going to go straight-to-video but after positive test screenings Universal decided to release it theatrically & it made over 30 million in it's US run alone, the production values are good, the acting is good & it's well made which might actually go against the films seedy & graphic nature.The Last House on the Left is another decent remake that is almost as good as the original but not quite, it's certainly graphic for a mainstream film & it may disturb some but you know what, it's only a film so don't worry about it. Better than I expected to be honest.",The Last House on the Left
17,dbborroughs,Really good but unnecessary remake is one of the best of the recent glut of retread horror films and a fine horror film on its own,7,28 April 2009,"Remake of the Wes Craven horror classic (considered by some) that was based on Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring. The basic plot is simple. A band of villains brutalize a couple of girls out in the woods. When they need to take shelter they do so at the home of a nice family. All is going well until the family discovers that the visitors tortured their daughter and they decide to see that justice is done. Well made revenge flick with amped up violence and nastiness was an odd viewing experience for me. yes its well done and tense, with villains that really need killing, but now 35 years down the road the original has been riffed on so many times that there is little thats new here except the level of violence. I don't see why, other than for money (despite no prospect for a sequel), why the original had to be remade. Then again I'm thrilled that here was a remake that doesn't stink.I mean how many horror films from the 1970's and 80's have been remade badly recently? Yes its good. Yes its exactly what you think its going to be. No its not required viewing. If you like this sort of thing and know what you're getting into give it a shot.",The Last House on the Left
18,lastliberal,The Last House Redux,7,13 March 2009,"The no-remake purists will be screaming, but the fact is that the 1972 Wes Craven film was just a remake of a film that 99% of the purists have probably never seen. This film beats the 1972 film by a mile.First, there is the rape scene that one newspaper reviewer called ""...one of the most graphically brutal and terrifying rapes ever put on screen."" Obviously, he never saw I Spit on Your Grave. That was brutal! What I am most reminded of in watching this film is Wes Craven's Red Eye. The tension and surprises were continual once that family (Tony Goldwyn & Monica Potter) realizes who is responsible for what happened to their daughter (Sara Paxton).You will also note the torture porn elements as the father selects from a shelf full of implements to use in seeking revenge. The use of household appliances was a unique element not seen before, and really gave a graphic and satisfying ending to the film.I was gratified that the final fight sequence was realistic in the sense that, despite the adrenaline rushing through the father, he was still getting his ass whipped until the son appeared. It took a tag team approach to bring that sucker down and prepare him for his just rewards.Fans of the genre have to be a little disappointed that the only titillating scenes came from the killers girlfriend (Riki Lindhome), and only towards the end of the film.All-in-all, it was superior to the 1972 film and a worth successor to the Bergman original.",The Last House on the Left
19,zardoz-13,Nowhere Near As Depraved As The Original!,4,19 March 2009,"The only thing surprising about the new remake of Wes Craven's landmark horror chiller ""Last House on the Left"" is that Craven and co-producer Sean S. Cunningham waited so long to do it. A former humanities professor, Craven ranks as one of the maestros of movie mayhem. He launched the Freddie Kruger ""Nightmare on Elm Street "" franchise back in 1984 and then scared up the ""Scream"" trilogy in 1996. Before those two successful series, he helmed ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977) and ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" (1985), and served as producer on both remakes in both in 2006 and 2007. He is known for his 1982 horror comedy creature feature ""Swamp Thing."" Craven's first film, ""Last House on the Left,"" marked him for future notoriety. Sean S. Cunningham produced ""Last House"" for Craven in 1972. Eight years later in 1980, Cunningham made horror movie history himself with ""Friday the 13th."" Craven and Cunningham have teamed up to produce Greek director Dennis Iliadis' ""Last House on the Left"" remake. Best known for ""Hardcore"" (2005), a grim drama about prostitution set in Athens , Greece , Iliadis appeared to be the ideal director for this new, updated, R-rated remake starring Sarah Paxton, Monica Potter, and Tony Goldwyn. Comparatively, Iliadis' ""Last House on the Left"" lacks the sadism of both the ""Saw"" and the ""Hostel"" movies and the eerie atmosphere of the original. Nevertheless, audiences that crave watching make-believe characters stab, rape, and then shoot other make-believe characters to death may applaud this lackluster remake.Two teenage girlfriends, Mari Collingwood (Sarah Paxton of ""Sydney White"") and Paige (Martha MacIsaac of ""Superbad""), get together back when Mari arrives in town with her parents. Dr. John Collingwood (Tony Goldwyn of ""Ghost"") and his wife Emma (Monica Potter of ""Con-Air""), are taking a vacation in the country where they own a lake-front house. Overachieving swim champ daughter Mari borrows mom and dad's Chevy Suburban to visit Paige in town. Paige works the cash register at a convenience store. Things take a turn for the worse when a hooded teenager, Justin (Spencer Treat Clark of ""Superheroes""), asks for a pack of cigarettes. Paige won't sell them because Justin appears underage. Justin has been eavesdropping on the gals and knows Paige wants to score some marijuana. Reluctantly, Mari drives Paige and Justin back to Justin's motel where he rolls up some premium grade-A Columbian. Yes, Paige sold Justin cigarettes because she had to have some weed. Everybody is huffing and puffing on pot when Justin's Manson-looking dad, Krug (Garrett Dillahunt of HBO's ""Deadwood""), his Uncle Francis (Aaron Paul of ""Mission Impossible 3""), and Sadie (Riki Lindhome of ""Gilmore Girls"") walk in on them.Krug is an escaped convict. The police were taking Krug to prison when Sadie and Francis rescued him. They caught two unsuspecting cops off guard at a railroad crossing and T-boned the police cruiser with a big truck. Sadie shot the driver in the head and Krug strangled the detective beside the driver. Since the authorities have launched a manhunt, our evildoers cannot turn Mari and Paige loose. Mari and Paige realize too late that their geese are cooked. Krug commandeers Mari's Suburban, and they cruise off into the woods to avoid roadblocks. They pass not far from where Mari's parents live. Mari's unexplained disappearance has Emma and John upset. Meanwhile, Mari and Paige attempt to escape from their captors by scorching Sadie with a cigarette lighter. In the confusion, Krug crashes the truck into a tree. Enraged by the girls' defiance, Krug and company torture them.Although the violence in Iliadis' ""Last House"" remake is graphic, Craven's original--even after almost 40 years--surpasses the remake in terms of its depravity. Iliadis and ""Disturbia"" scenarist Carl Ellsworth with newcomer Adam Alleca have made many drastic changes that prove the old saying 'they don't make movies like they used to.' Indeed, they have eliminated a great deal about the original ""Last House"" that made it such a memorable nightmare. Iliadis and his writers have retained the basic premise, but the current crop of torture porn pictures overshadows their remake. The remake's most talked about momentif you've glimpsed the traileris the notorious microwave scene. A man's head is jammed into a microwave and cooked until it explodes. Several friends have assured me that microwaves don't work with the door open, but reality rarely dictates what Hollywood presents in movies.Like its horrific predecessor, the ""Last House on the Left"" remake depicts poetic justice. The depraved deviants slaughter the innocent in the first half, while the parents turn the tables on the dastards in the second half. Ultimately, the villains suffer more than their innocent victims. This difference is what separates ""Last House on the Left"" from the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" movies. When the parents pay back the perpetrators in ""Last House on the Left,"" you may find yourself howling for blood and that's what makes the movie so wicked.",The Last House on the Left

It is at that point that the lives of these two teenagers is flipped upside down.The first thought that may have entered your mind is probably somewhere along the lines of: ""Don't you know better?"" But of course, they were in a small town and the guy seemed so innocent... which he was; it was just his dad, dad's girlfriend and his uncle that were ape nuts.This movie was more about the toughness and tenacity of a teen and the resourcefulness and fight of a couple of regular parents than anything else. From the character development you gather that the girl and her family are the epitome of normal while the criminals in this movie are the epitome of psychotic. Without a doubt you find yourself wishing for the demise of the bad guys while hoping for the triumph of the captives. Of course, there are the ""Oh My God, why did you do that?"" moments that are customary for any thriller/horror flick.There have been better movies from this genre; either better stories, or more affable characters, or gorier, or more sinister, etc. but this movie holds its own.",The Last House on the Left

Two teenage girls are abducted, raped and left for dead and the guilty make the mistake of arriving at the parents of one of the victims. This results in graphic revenge when their daughter appears. Realistic setup becomes predictable and way too gruesome. Directed by Dennis Iliadis with decent photography. Unlike the original film, the cast are subdued by cardboard. Sara Paxton and Martha MacIsaac play the victims while Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter play the vengeful parents. The problem here is standard Hollywood interference where the realism and controversy of the original is compromised. For example, Paxton surviving is the studio decision to leave somewhat a happy ending. In the original the ending was not so happy for Lucy Grantham and Sandra Cassel whose deaths are way too disturbing but at least remained credible for the plot. Then we have the disturbed son of the villains turning good and actually surviving. In the original this kid was so dominated by his cruel father that he was forced to shoot himself. The son is played by Spencer Treat Clark and the role was much better in the original film. Perhaps somebody should do the same with this celebrated violence.

Among the problems here is the fact that the first half is just criminally boring, as there's not much of anything that keeps the interest or really gets involved with what happened throughout here. The early build-up of them going around town and meeting up with her friend that introduces them to the group isn't all that interesting and really feels like a contrivance to introduce them to the group while really holding this one down from its interesting parts here. Likewise, the set-up of the group happening upon the house takes way too long to fulfill here as their hospitality is certainly welcomed but it drags way past helpful here as the discovery comes rather late here due to the incessant nature of these scenes, while the final brawl is slightly too underwhelming here with the father not getting full revenge by showing him to be clearly outmatched and needing to be rescued in order to be saved which just is really that satisfying thematically. This one also tends to get overplayed here with a protracted stalking scene as them going after the group really makes the film overlong at the final resolution rather than actually building suspense here, and there's a lot of build-up here that doesn't really offer up much. As well, this section highlights another big problem here in that this was significantly down-played from the original by completely ignoring the dirty, grimy feel that should've been a part of this one from the very beginning and is instead way too clean and sanitized, one of the more important and certainly worthwhile elements of the original that's completely missing here which really renders a lot of the problems here along with the uncomfortable feeling in the rape scenes that's really unsettling to watch. While these really hold this one down the few positive parts do stick out with the film's best part being the additional energy the film gets here as it did manage to get a little better as it went along by really picking up steam with the confrontation in the woods leading to the actual encounter here from the tense car ride through the woods, the fun crashing sequence and the resulting chases through the woods which sets up that whole sequence and eventual escape. Likewise, there's a lot of fun here with the actual revenge being taken out against the group as these vicious, brutal and violent brawls are quite cathartic and really important at making the revenge seem logical and well-thought-out here as the action throughout the house, from the bloody kitchen encounter to the chasing in the guest-house that includes the gunfight alongside the rather fine encounter in the bathroom all leading nicely into the big, knockdown brawl for its final resolution, there's some really enjoyable action scenes throughout here that makes this one quite fun. While it wasn't terrible, it wasn't an entertaining film either.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, a Rape Scene, Full Nudity and drug use.",The Last House on the Left

They reach the family house, telling John and Emma that they have just had a car accident. Emma and John welcome the strangers until Mari comes home......Wes Cravens movie was a very hard movie to watch, but it was exploitation, and an above average commentary on society, and how we all turn to animals in desperation, no matter what class you are in.This however, is just another dire remake, and the fact that it's been Hollywood-ised, rather than going down the exploitation route like remake of I Spit On Your Grave, makes it all the more uncomfortable to watch.The cast are good, really good, but the director thinks that showing how despicable Krug is every three or four minutes is justified. For example, when he shows the detective the picture of his family whist killing him, will make you realise how you will feel about this movie.The subject matter is dealt with hap hazardly, and the assault is as disgusting as you would expect.But then the final act just goes for the gore factor, and you lose anything you had with the film to begin with.Its one of those movies that should have been left alone, it's ugly, disturbing, and downright disgusting.

26,Wuchakk,Beauty and the Beast,9,12 January 2011,"I admit I originally had no interest in seeing this '09 remake of 1972's ""Last House on the Left"", which involved the rape/murder of two girls and the ensuing revenge by the parents of one of the girls (loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" from 1960). Why not? Because the original ""Last House"" was just so dumb. I know many hail it for being ""disturbing"" due to the vile, sadistic villains and the humiliation, rape and gory murders -- but I didn't find it disturbing at all. Why? Because the preposterous storyline accompanied by the goofy music and bumbling cops made it impossible to take serious. Consequently, just like I don't consider the violence in, say, a Road Runner cartoon disturbing -- because it's impossible to take seriously -- so I didn't find ""Last House"" disturbing. Dumb? Yes. An interesting early 70's curiosity? Yes. Disturbing? No.Apparently director Dennis Iliadis and writers Adam Alleca & Carl Ellsworth understood the blatant flaws of the original because this remake overcomes them all and is a near masterpiece of filmmaking.Without knowing what it was, I stumbled upon this remake last summer while channel-surfing in a motel in the heart of Nebraska; the opening caught my attention and I became engrossed. About 40 minutes into the story it dawned on me that this was the remake of ""Last House on the Left."" Although I couldn't finish the film, the first thing I did when I got home was order the DVD.What makes this remake so good? For one thing, the filmmaking itself is top-of-the-line -- the cinematography, music, cast, acting, mood, suspense, etc. all work together to make a superior piece of cinematic art -- yes, even though it's ""just a horror flick."" I was particularly impressed with the way the film juxtaposes the beauty of nature & people/family with the hideousness of human evil. Take, for example, the opening scenes of the beautiful woods & music followed by the thug's murderous escape and the later sequence where a fleeing girl is shot while swimming through a lake. The film was incidentally shot in Helderberg Nature Preserve, Western Cape, South Africa, of all places. Gorgeous locations, to say the least, and a fine stand-in for somewhere-in-the-sticks, USA.The character of Justin was another great element. Through no fault of his own he's the teenage son of the main scumbag. It's clear that Justin hates the perverseness and hypocrisy of his ""family life"" and craves normalcy and genuine love. He's in torment but is too afraid of his father to overtly act (and understandably so), but he does what he can, when he can. The message of Justin is that people are not cursed to follow the wicked/foolish ways of their bloodline. Simple wisdom and force of righteous will breaks the curse. Redemption is there, if you want it.I also liked the way the film depicts the duplicity of the thug gang, particularly the leader Krug (Garret Dillahunt). He's the ultimate POS but watch him cover-up his intrinsic wickedness with his knack for social acclimation -- a fake smile, innocent smalltalk and a well-placed ""Amen."" The film successfully shows how some people aren't what they appear to be; they're the express opposite! Not to mention the flick is a good reminder to always be on your guard. Don't be naive; not everyone's like you or me. Some people will happily abuse, rape and kill without a second thought. They're scum, pure and simple (by their OWN foolish choices). If you have daughters make sure they view this, even though some parts are hard to watch.Also, the numerous preposterous elements of the original story have been fixed. The family is vacationing in a wilderness area and there's only one town nearby. The daughter successfully steers the criminals close to her home, unbeknownst to them. The thugs aren't dressed-to-the-nines when they show up at the parent's doorstep, not to mention they have a legitimate reason (""There's been an accident"").The goofy elements of the original -- the silly music and bumbling cops -- have been eliminated altogether. The film has a serious, realistic vibe and therefore the horrific events are taken seriously.There are a couple of clichéd horror aspects I could do without, specifically the scenes involving a garbage disposal and a microwave. They're a bit silly and needlessly stretch the believability. But then it struck me that they're types of universal/divine judgment & justice; so that's cool.Another aspect that improved upon the original involves one of the victimized girls, but I don't want to give it away.The theatrical version runs 110 minutes and the unrated version four minutes longer; both versions are featured on the DVD (I haven't seen the unrated version since the theatrical was more than enough for me, if you know what I mean).FINAL ANALYSIS: This '09 remake of ""Last House on the Left"" is vastly superior in every conceivable way and proves that remakes can and should be made when/if appropriate. In ways it's even a masterpiece, a brilliant showcase of beauty and the beast. Don't miss out just because you thought the original was a POS.GRADE: A",The Last House on the Left

The only remakes that were good so far were The Hills and Halloween. Well, add this one too. It clocks in over more than 90 minutes just like MBV, I watched my watch a lot when watching MBV, I never did watching this gem. This movie doesn't have any CGI, they go for brutality and straight horror. From the first 5 minutes you know what you will get. The first part is the humiliation of the two girls, the second part is the revenge, both coming straight to you, and the score helps too. The score does work here. All actors are believable. After having some rough movies from France I guess Hollywood has his lesson, here they proof that they are capable of making them too (without the help of French directors like The Hills).

Violence creates more violence which the story reflects with this film. The family finds their daughter who their house guests have hurt badly which makes the family seek revenge on the scum. The family also needs to defend themselves and escape from these evil people. The on slot of violence towards the human scum is relentless. I found the movie too much.

29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Last House on the Left,7,20 August 2009,"Karmic retribution, or what goes around comes around. The odds for the logic of this film to work is like a million to one, where those who trespass against you, well, you will decide to trespass against them and return them the disfavour when they literally walk into the lion's den. Yours. With home territory advantage, it doesn't need rocket science to predict what would happen next.This remake of the Wes Craven's 70s movie of the same name, had its entire premise unfortunately spoilt by the trailer designer, who had spelled out every major incident, twist and turn, including the climax of course. So if you're still in the dark about what the story's actually about, then skip the trailer altogether, though it'll still work if you're in the mood for a revenge flick that doesn't flinch from executing its payload. Well, actually most films of today are truly graphically realistic in nature, and not having seen the original will disallow me to compare which of the two had more a more satisfying gore factor, in case you're wondering.In some ways the film resembled Taken in its base premise, as if issuing out a veiled warning to its teen demographic audience that Parents know best, and any deviation in hard-to- obtain-approval teenage plans, like taking the car for a spin, going out on your own with dubious friends, come complete with red flashing light warnings if you fail to stick to them, and exploit the situation through winging it on the blind side. The downside of course to such irresponsible behaviour, is the cautionary bad things that will happen to you mantra being repeated, and not every parent a trained covert black ops person, or a skilled doctor with superb anatomical knowledge to bail you out, and/or inflict maximum pain with minimal effort.It's a tale of two halves which director Dennis Iliadis seemed to have helmed two separate films instead of one. The different generations of the Collingwood family get their respective focus in each half (with those not in focus conveniently parked aside), while that of Krug (Garret Dillahunt) and his merry gang go through a reversal of roles, in a sort of cause and effect manner where each action or inaction, resulted in an equivalent push back from the other side. Iliadis also did well in eliciting a response from the audience. One can hear a pin drop when a heinous crime against women is committed and shown on screen, and an opposite response of cheers ringing out when the perpetrator gets his just desserts when vigilante justice got served.Amongst the horror-mystery-thriller remakes that are flooding the market these days, The Last House on the Left works because of Iliadis playing this straight and without frills, giving the film and its situation of trauma and desperation very much as close to what you would imagine should you get caught in a similar situation. The cast also helped, where the psychotic flip-flopped in bringing out their play-acting facade against their revolting acts of violence, where the meek really cowering, and the vengeful seething with rage. Perhaps the only wasteful character would be Riki Limehome's Sadie, girlfriend of Krug, who is only too eager to shed her clothes for no reason (except perhaps to flaunt her body for the screen), but of course I'm not complaining.Sure there are some loopholes and genre conveniences like power outages and the perennial cell phones with no network coverage (I swear this in some 101 handbook somewhere for storywriters and filmmakers), and a final scene which looked more like wanting to end it all with a bang, but overlook those areas, and you may enjoy a thriller where vengeful parents are given the cinematic license to wage war without remorse in the protection of their children.",The Last House on the Left
30,HumanoidOfFlesh,Seriously good remake of Craven's notorious rape and revenge classic.,8,19 May 2009,"Mari,teenage daughter of John and Emma,leaves her folks at the lake home while she and her weed-minded pal go into town and get to know a strange young guy who has marijuana they're looking for back at a pretty rough-looking motel.When his family of sadistic hoodlums arrives-father Krug chief among them,a recent prison escapee and heartless sociopath-the girls' lives get much worse very quickly.They are subjected to torture,rape and murder in the woods.When four criminals arrive at night at home of John and Emma the bloody parental vengeance begins...This surprisingly nasty and unusually well-acted remake was produced by Wes Craven and his old friend Sean S. Cunningham of ""Friday the 13th"" fame.""The Last House on the Left"" actually improves upon its 1972 predecessor by allowing one of its victims to survive.There is also no attempts at silly humour and two bumbling cops are gone.The rape of Mari is quite shocking and the scenes of violence are hard-hitting.The characters are well-developed,however Garret Dillahunt as the leader Krug sadly isn't as menacing as David Hess.Still very gritty and overall solid remake.8 out of 10.",The Last House on the Left
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,I haven't said this in a while: THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL,8,22 March 2009,"Let's face it, there are a lot of remakes, there are some good one's: The Thing, The Hills have Eyes, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There are some average one's: House of Wax, House on Haunted Hill, and War of the Worlds. Then there are the bad one's: Halloween, The Fog, and Psycho. Last House on the Left, my parents had absolutely held me from the original movie, but when I became an adult I rented the movie and watched it by myself, I was just so curious what they were trying to hold me back from, I wasn't really shocked with the movie, I could see how it was gritty and brutal in the day, but after seeing movies like I spit on your grave, Hostel, Dirty Harry, Casino, etc, it just didn't really effect me. So I was actually looking forward to a remake of this just to see what they would do with the story and I have to say that they not only made it better, it was just a very great horror film that made me want to take 15 showers afterwards.Mari and her family are going on vacation. When they arrive at the house, Mari asks to sleep in the guest house instead of in the main house. Mari's brother, Ben, had died one year earlier, and the family are still trying to adjust to his absence. She finds a necklace he gave her and puts it on. She decides to ride into town to see her friend Paige. Mari's mother, Emma, is cautious, but her father, John, lets her go. Mari meets up with Paige at the store where Paige is employed. A young kid named Justin approaches the counter and asks for a pack of cigarettes, which Paige does not give to him due to his age. Justin says that if they join him at his motel room, he will give them marijuana. Paige agrees and sells him the cigarettes. They drive to Justin's motel room and Justin and Paige enter. Mari waits in the car but notices they are taking too long. She enters the room where she finds Justin and Paige on the bed getting high. She joins them and they decide to give Justin a makeover. They are interrupted by Krug, Sadie, and Francis. Krug explains that it is too risky to let Paige and Mari live. They decide to not only murder but rape the young girls. The gang goes to Mari's house not knowing that's where she's staying with her parents, her parents welcome the gang in thinking they got into a car accident. But Mari somehow survives and comes back home; her parents discover that the people they've been helping are the same people that just tried to murder their daughter and now it's time for justice.This is the movie that you cannot wait to see justice brought to these sleazebags, they were so disgusting, I was just screaming and cheering in the theater. Like the tag line said, if bad people hurt someone you love, how far would you go to hurt them back? If that was my daughter, you wouldn't wanna know the sick things I would've done to these slimy people. The thing that made this movie so horrific was how realistic it was. The rape scene doesn't show much but is one of the most graphic and disturbing in cinema, even my 25 year old boyfriend had to cover his eyes, he said he was just incredibly sick from it because he can't imagine the pain she was going through. The performances are on and the story is great. I would say this is one of the best remakes in years, this is not for the faint of heart though, but if you're curious about the remake, trust me, this was a very respectful movie of the original horror story of murder and revenge.8/10",The Last House on the Left
32,blanbrn,Brutal and sadistic well done torture remake that awards revenge in the end.,7,15 March 2009,"""The Last House on the Left"" a remake of the shocking and chilling 1972 film done by Wes Craven, again showed just how brutal and sick that some people can be. The particular rape scene will be tough for many to watch, yet aside from that the film does have somewhat of a story to it. Starting when an inmate escapes from police and he's picked up by his brother and main female squeeze the convict finds his son. It's upon his finding of his son he meets two young teenage females only to brutally attack and torture and leave them for dead. Only one gets away and as odd as it may seem this film takes a twist when the trio of goons take up residence at a home of a well to do vacationing couple who are the parents of the surviving girl! Then even as sick and sadistic as this horror movie is enter for some suspense and drama as this sets up the ultimate showdown of revenge and it's rightfully due. Overall a good remake even though the rape scene is tough and disturbing ""The Last House on the Left"" is well paced and it showcases the sadistic side of human life so well yet it rewards the viewer and society by showing that revenge is due and it's rightfully served out.",The Last House on the Left

34,sddavis63,"A Good ""Revenge"" Movie - Although Extremely And Graphically Violent",6,12 February 2010,"Once this gets going, it turns into a pretty decent suspense shocker that keeps you watching, and even though you can be pretty sure how it's going to turn out you do find yourself every now and then on the edge of your seat waiting to see how the movie is going to get where it's obviously going. It is true, though, that it takes a while to get going, and that not a lot really happens for the first half hour or so. It's a revenge movie, as the parents of a teenage girl who's raped and almost murdered set out to get the group responsible. The emotion is raw and very well portrayed and the various characters seem realistic - at least, as realistic as you would expect in this kind of movie. Although it wasn't the most important role in the movie, I thought Spencer Treat Clark's portrayal of Justin was excellent. Justin was the son of the rapist - not participating in his dad's actions but shell-shocked by them you might say; sympathetic to the victims but not able to get out of the mess his dad has put him in. Clark showed perfectly the sort of numbed bewilderment you might expect someone in that position to feel.This movie is extremely - and graphically - violent and bloody. Especially disturbing was the scene in which young Mari is raped. I've rarely seen as graphic a rape scene as portrayed here. It's very unpleasant and unsettling to watch, as you can feel Mari's terror and pain throughout. Once her parents figure out what's going on, the revenge portion of the movie is also graphic and violent, although one can certainly understand the motivation of the parents. I have to confess, though, that I was completely turned off by the very last scene of the movie, which portrayed the last act of revenge. I won't give details, except to say that I found it distasteful even for this genre - too over the top and largely unnecessary at this point - the movie should have ended with the family (and Justin) getting away in the boat, which at least would have left the viewer with a sense of relief. Up to that point this had been pretty good, but a movie that leaves me with a real feeling of distaste loses a bit with me. 6/10",The Last House on the Left
35,thesar-2,If only they picked the one on the right...stupid monkey,7,5 August 2009,"There's a point where you print ""Spoiler Alert"" because you're giving away a plot point, such as Princess Leia is Luke's sister. So I can't really say I'm going to give away the last minute or so of the 2009 remake of 'The Last House on the Left.' Suffice to say, it's a horrible contradiction (to the last half) of events that nearly brought down the wonderful house of cards this 'Last House' was built on. For, I really liked this movie, yet hated the final minute. I saw the original, and despite its buck ninety-eight budget, it was a domineering movie filled with rightful revenge. This one updates that for a more modern crowd and throws in realism as it's more of a self-defense movie. Gory? Oh, heck yeah. Uncomfortable, sure. But effective, absolutely. We have here a family vacationing in the woods, in a house (guess where it's located, yet it really never comes upin either film.) Their young daughter strays with the only vehicle and inadvertently gets raped and left for dead by hoodlums on the run. The coincidentally end up at the house following a car crash and while they slumber, the daughter returns home. Okay, maybe I'm giving away too much, but this was all part of the 30-year-old film by Wes Craven (now with Sean S. Cunningham. For horror fans, that's like seeing a true-life Freddy Vs. Jason.) Dr. & Mrs. Parents realize she was attacked by their guests and they plan their escape. Despite its rampant gore, it was worth viewing as it was enormously realistic and you constantly putting yourself in their shoes. Again, the last minute or so (you can safely see this in the trailer, so I knew it was coming) kinda ruins it, but overall, still worth a viewing.",The Last House on the Left
36,bowmanblue,"Cruel, brutal and disturbingly watchable",7,25 October 2014,"I've never seen the original Last House on the Left, but I hear it was pretty shocking in its day. I knew this was a remake, so I didn't set my expectations too high (we all know how good remakes normally are). Now, I don't know if the words 'pleasantly surprised' should be used to describe a film so horrible as Last House on the Left, but it was actually quite good (obviously, if you're in the mood for something so nasty).Yes, it's very violent - horribly so. The violence will certainly turn a lot of viewers off. It's really only for those with a strong stomach who will get anything out of it. It's about a family who take a vacation to a nig house in the middle of an American forest and come a cropper at the hands of a particularly nasty gang of thieves who are on the run from the authorities.Firstly the teenage daughter and her friends are subjected to some extreme punishment at the hands of the gang, who then leave her for dead and seek refuge in - none other than - the parents' holiday home. Soon the parents realise that they're harbouring the very people who have hurt their daughter and decide to act some revenge of their own.The first thing to say is that all the cast play their respective parts well. The family are nice, but not squeaky-clean enough to be annoying. And the villains are bad, but not in a pantomime style. That way, you're rooting for the right people when it comes to dishing out a much-needed taste of their own medicine. Also, the characters behave in a logical way. There might be the odd moment where they do stupid things, but with horror films they're normally doing this all the time. Here, the daftness of decision-making is kept to a minimum.If you're in the mood for some extreme violence (and the Hostel films won't suffice) then give this a go. It's nasty, but one of the better (dare I call it...) 'torture p0rn' films.)",The Last House on the Left

In the original, she seemed quite dead in the lake. This new version follows the original pretty closely except for that point. This movie lacked the almost satiric humor from the original, and the gang doesn't humiliate the girls as much in the woods as in the original. But, still, this movie is gross and not for the squeamish or kids. At least at the end, you can root for the parents. In this, they come up with a good way to do Krug in. Mari's dad comes up with a torturous demise.FINAL VERDICT: For all the gore and blood fans, this movie has quite a bit. I recommend it for those that like sick thrillers.",The Last House on the Left

39,johnnyboyz,"Limp and plodding film that is made competently enough, but falls short of what it wants to do.",5,26 June 2009,"The last time I heard of, or engaged with, a text in which the two principal characters were called John and Emma must have been the British, 1960s-produced TV series that spawned an ill-received 1998 adaptation, all of which existed under the name of 'The Avengers'. This 2009 version of The Last House on the Left sees two pretty central characters; those that make up the, admittedly pretty meek, bulk of the film's study; additionally named John and Emma and the 'avenging' they get up to when it arises foul play was the order of the day earlier on. But don't be fooled; this isn't some limp, border-line camp depiction of whatever mis-adventures might happen between two people; this is revenge in the style of blood, guts and gore.Alas, the film cannot really hold weight. It wants to be gritty, disturbing – it wants to be about something and, bless it, it tries awful hard to be. But sitting down and thinking about it, the film doesn't cover half as much ground as I think it would like. The basis for the film, indeed the tag-line, is: 'If bad people hurt someone you love, how far would you go to hurt them back?' The film should be about a journey, not a physical one but a psychological one, but it's not – it is more pre-occupied with 'how to maim' rather than 'how do I get to this point that I am able to maim'. For a vastly superior study in every sense, see Noé's 2002 film Irréversible; a film that uses the grotty and grimy locales of Paris as a setting for the continuously emotionally-boiling over boyfriend of a rape victim as he hunts the perpetrator with a vengeance.Where-as Irréversible gives us the spark that lit the match and the denouement in which the protagonist finds his man as great scenes of unrest and despicability, The Last House on the Left feels the need to pile on the horror and the gore as a continuous ebb of action and would-be scares. Like 1975's Jaws and 1977's Star Wars, both of which very much fall into the action genre, they conclude with an explosion – action films these days can only blow stuff up along the way and then round things off with a limp finale. Unfortunately, The Last House on the Left subscribes to the latter ideation and, in truth, it is just a bunch of people maiming one another with hammers, fire stokers and so fourth, while, somewhere within is a would-be study of morals and emotional drive hiding in there amongst it all.The film's set up gives us all the necessary this-and-that: sadistic villains going about their business under the gloom of night; upstanding, 'perfect' contemporary Amercian families with a pretty daughter, loving parents and a lake house (all that's missing is a golden Labrador and a slightly-older-than-his-sister son named Billy). They are the Collingwoods, and their scenes are warm, shot in the daylight and they grumble about the smallest of issues such as why a ropey old sign still welcomes them to their own holiday home. The parents are the soon-to-be avengers John and Emma (no, not those ones) and the daughter is Mari (Paxton).These people come a cropper when Mari and her obligatorily daft friend Paige (MacIsaac) try to come into possession of some drugs at a remote motel housing Justin (Treat Clark) and his less than pleasant family; whose faces are plastered all over the front page of local newspapers following an escape from the law. The villains of the piece, while sadistic and evil and all the things they need to be, don't individually strike you as particularly nasty – they exist within the film's universe to maim and face the threat of maiming. There is no single, particular threat about these people as there are with other such diverse examples ranging from Ray Winstone's character in Nil By Mouth; or Ben Kingsley's in Sexy Beast right the way through to a more recent example in Ledger's Joker character. Krug (Dillahunt) and co. in The Last House on the Left are mere ingredients; bland and tasteless ingredients designed to, hopefully, add flavour to a recipe that, if mixed all together, might produce something interesting. Unfortunately, they don't and rather than inhabit personalities like the said examples; who have goals and something about them that is instinctively uncanny within the world of the film that's taking place, we're really just watching relatively young, unshaven, jacket-and-jean clad hicks-come-criminals doing nasty stuff because some sort of would-be ""study"" demands it.On the film's IMDb trivia page, we're told the film producers underwent a search for about a hundred different directors before settling with Dennis Iliadis. This suggests a certain lack of real empathy for the issues the film wants to explore; it suggests that this is no one vision of the psychological and emotional drive human beings go through at any one time more than it is a bog-standard genre picture; driven by a studio and ultimately a remake of something you might have heard of in the past, and thus might be interested in seeing. The trivia page also goes on about the piece coming close to a direct-to-DVD release, something that is actually quite alarming but unsurprising when you think back to the blandness of the study and the over-emphasis on the different ways to maim and shame people. Director Illiadis likes his blood, his shots of flesh cutting and his close ups in general but it's not enough to sustain a large amount of interest in what is, essentially, a film supposed to be actually about something.",The Last House on the Left
40,filipemanuelneto,A decent remake,6,22 February 2017,"This movie is a remake of another movie, older and forgotten. The story revolves around three sadistic criminals who kill mercilessly and who decide to hide in a quiet middle-aged couple's vacation home, hours after they raped and tried to kill their daughter. The story is really good and the environment is tense from start to finish. The rape scene is one of the hardest to watch I've ever seen. However, from the middle, the film loses some interest because it becomes predictable and similar to other horror films like ""You're Next"", for example. What saves the film, at that moment, is the sympathy that we have already felt for the couple and their daughter. This connection allows the public's attention not to be scattered because we still want to see the bad guys punished. Garret Dillahunt is incredible in the role of the gang boss, managing to make his character an unbearably disgusting presence. Riki Lindhome and Aaron Paul were more restrained but no less competent. Sara Paxton was reasonable, but her role gradually becomes secondary, giving way to Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter, a good duo who really did a great job. In the end, what we have is a good remake that, while not surprising, is able to entertain and cause some shivers.",The Last House on the Left
41,TheMovieDiorama,The Last House On The Left went so far left that I couldn't make a U-turn.,6,24 October 2018,"Well...suffice to say I was not expecting that. Craven's original isn't exactly a masterpiece, but much to my surprise (or lack of...), a remake was made and here we are. A waste disposing, microwaving and nose-breaking thriller that relishes in its explicit sadistic violence. A group of crazed criminals are on the run, and encounter two young girls who they brutally murder. Little did they know, that one of the girl's parents live nearby and...well, they get involved. Word of advice. When you kidnap a girl (although I recommend you don't) and they give you simple directions to go left, you go right. Because going left is rather eventful. As with most remakes of torture horrors, the violence is gratuitous. However, in this version it is somewhat more realistic with less methodical planning. Aside from the absolutely ridiculous final sequence that negates the realism that preceded it, there are no intricate contraptions. Just two parents fighting back in desperation and vengeance. Goldwyn and Potter give commendably strong performances to convey this, with Dillahunt stealing every scene with his antagonistic role. The script is fairly standard, with no real emotional conviction at any point. Although Iliadis' direction felt surprisingly visual, with several long takes of no verbal communication. Whether it be Mari fleeing the criminals or ferociously swimming, it strangely captures your attention through slow motion and a booming musical score. There is unfortunately a huge dip in pacing when commencing the second act as the criminals encounter the parents. Neither the script or direction can maintain the suspense required to hold the viewer's attention. You are simply just waiting for the inevitable violent third act, and that isn't enough motive to sit through the second act. Just fast forward it. The rape scene wasn't exactly pleasant to watch either. Aside from the forgettable second act, microwave fetish and occasionally weak script, it's not a bad film.

43,BaronBl00d,Not Bad for a Remake...But It Is an Emasculated Remake Nonetheless,6,27 September 2009,"Would Wes Craven ever have believed that his films from the 70's The Hills Have Eyes and The Last House on the Left would be remade and repackaged to the public again. Here 35 years later is a remake of a truly seminal film in the American horror genre. A film so vile in many ways that it makes my top ten list of films that make you feel like you need a bath after watching them list(along with his original Hills). Craven's early work pressed and surpassed so many boundaries, and he did so in a decade when a director and a few producers with a very small budget could do so. That early film, despite its vile characteristics(and they are legion) is oddly effective and truly frightening. That film had rape, death by chainsaw, and a death by dismemberment that would make any lucid man's ears prick with terror. I knew going into the 2009 version of that film that it would be much tamer. I was right. The funny thing is that younger people today think that because a film shows a lot of blood and guts that the horror film has come ""so far"" from that ""lame"" crap from way back when. They are soooo wrong. Movies like the original Last House, Hills, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, etc... showed enough blood and guts but really made films that had incredibly twisted and perverse edges to them. This film has a rape scene like the first, and though it is traumatizing and unpleasant it just doesn't have that unsavory nastiness of the first film. Most of the other changes were likewise effectively done or ineffective by my standards. Don't get me wrong: this film is okay and as remakes go is better than average. The direction is clear and crisp, the production values very nice, and the acting is more than adequate in many instances. The story follows about 50% of the original with some big differences in the second half that are so today and not then. They are changes that appease today's audience and its sensibilities. Though there is far more, buckets more blood in this film - the deaths appeared to me to be far less grisly. I know someone out there is saying I have to be kidding, but I am one of those individuals affected by the power of suggestion rather than having to see absolutely everything on screen(which we don't get here either). The director chosen by Craven, Iliades, does a workmanlike job creating atmosphere, taut pacing, and even some depth in some characters. Actors Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter are very effective as the Collingwoods. Potter is a good actress and attractive to boot. She really gives the best performance in the film. The actors playing the thugs are okay, but let's face it not one of them in half as menacing as David Hess - and Garrett Dillahunt is miscast as Krug. He is too much of a pretty boy for the role. He never felt nearly as crazed and psychotic as Hess did in the original. Again, this film is not bad and like oh so many remakes of the 70's horror genre - these will become the originals in modern cultural discussion with a less well-informed public. That truly is a shame. Will they remake this film in another 35 years? If they do, then we will indeed(though I fear I will have departed by that time)live in an idiocracy.",The Last House on the Left

To me, it was very hard not to compare both.While the original has brutal, sadistic, and cruel violence; this remake was very toned down. Don't get me wrong, I'm not supporting raping, cruelty, and extreme violence; but the movie's plot and message justifies it.The most important scene in the movie deals with the raping of a virgin underage girl. In the original it's a brutal scene that also deals with gore and more; on this remake the fore-mentioned scene was VERY TONED DOWN by Hollywood and you can say it by the editing. The original was just merciless and painful to watch but it justified the parent's rage and revenge. Also, Paige's death was very light in this remake and well, as she wasn't a very developed character I didn't care that much for her.And that's my main beef with the remake. We didn't get much character development. First, Mari's parents were supposed to be on a marital crisis but it just was hinted; we didn't get also a development of their rage and revenge when they watched their ill daughter. On the villains side, we didn't get a complete development to Sadie's character, I mean, she didn't add anything to the plot she just was there looking hot and that's it. The same thing with Francis; he didn't have something interesting to add except his nasty broken nose.Krug was by far the most interesting character in the movie but he truly didn't have real moments to demonstrate why he was the main and most brutal villain in the movie.But after all, the plot delivers expectations and it's very clear since the beginning that this is going to be a 100% revenge flick. I dug it.The Direction is really classy and the atmosphere is always pale, sad, and unsettling. The lake and forest settings add mystery to the plot. Also, the camera angles are very good and creative for a movie like this; I liked the direct-to-video feeling which increases the disturbing factor.The acting is great. Everyone is perfect on their role. Special mention for Ben Goodwin who delivers a brave, dramatic, and raging performance. Great actor! Sarah Paxton delivers also a brave performance, way to go girl! With your looks and moods, I couldn't believe you starred in such a brutal film. Monica Potter looks really pretty but acts brave and smart when she had to do it. I really expected her character to use her sexuality as a weapon against her daughter's aggressors. But that's just me.I expected more violence on a revenge flick, I mean, the villains did something horrible and they deserved fatal and horrific demises as consequence. Maybe society is changing for good...",The Last House on the Left

Personally I like the idea of remakes. It makes it much more likely that the next generation coming through will get to experience all the great stories that were made famous back in the 70's and 80's. And that they will get to do so in a modernized way that chances are they will much prefer. They shouldn't take anything away from the original, and in most cases tend to make the original even better than before by comparison, but not in this case I suspect.The actors don't have disfigured faces, the characters aren't beyond reasoning (in fact they even seem quite reasonable) and yet the villains still seem terrifyingly menacing. How? By good writing. The clichés are kept to a minimum, and I found myself being taken by surprise, on more occasions than not, by the writers misleading tricks. A pleasant change from the usual.I prefer this type of revenge scenario to the style in Taken. In Taken you feel like you know how it's going to end before it's even begun. In this, right up until the last scene, the suspense is high and the viewer is experiencing a feeling of anything can happen. Much more exciting in my opinion.A very good film, sure not to disappoint. Not for the light hearted, mind you. Some shocking images at times portrayed, however if you feel you can handle these I think you'll find they add to the power of the film. One of the scenes I suspect was inspired by Saw. Read into that what you will. But a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",The Last House on the Left
47,billcr12,Average Remake,6,3 July 2012,"Wes Craven directed the original version of Last House on a shoestring budget, and always wished to remake it with better production values. He did so in 2009, and it is technically far superior to the 1972 film. The story remains pretty much the same with slight changes. Mari still goes looking for marijuana with her best friend, Paige, and they meet a guy who invites them to his hotel room where they smoke the evil weed. They are soon assaulted by two sadistic men and a woman. Mari is raped and Paige is stabbed with a knife, and left to bleed to death in the woods. Mari runs away but is shot in the back while swimming away. Somehow, the deadly quartet end up at Mari's parent's house where mommy and daddy discover the mistreatment of their darling daughter, and payback is a bitch. The Stepford couple go postal, seeking equal justice without remorse. One major change is made at the end, but I prefer the ending of the original. An average but violent horror flick.",The Last House on the Left

The storyline is consistent with the original and tells the tale of a couple young ladies sneaking out at night only to encounter a group of misfit killers looking for a good time of their own. This movie is directed by Dennis Iliadis (+1) and stars Tony Goldwyn (Scandal), Monica Potter (Patch Adams), Sara Paxton (Good Girls), Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) and Spencer Treat Clark (Mystic River). This movie was perfectly on track to be almost as good as the original until the killers arrive at the family's home and the movie rewrites the original storyline into a disappointment. I was really enjoying the first half of the movie and felt this was a very well done remake...but the end let me down. The killers are creepy, the parents compelling, and the circumstances well presented. This is definitely worth your time and you should see it, but falls short of the classic.

49,JoeB131,Remakes are not needed,4,17 September 2009,"We see another remake of a barely Grindhouse quality film from the 1970's. I think it is kind of telling that they really did tone this film down. In the original 1972 version, both girls are raped and killed (as opposed to one being raped and one being killed) and all the hoodlums die. This time, they try to make it more morally acceptable by making only one girl die and one girl get raped, and letting the morally ambiguous kid survive and kind of redeem himself. The MPAA was passing notes again.Was this film necessary to remake? Aboslutely not. It wasn't that good of a film to start with, really Wes Craven's Student Film Project in 1972. Yeah, so like the recent remakes of Halloween and Friday the 13th, it has better production values, but it's just a slasher film.",The Last House on the Left
50,drownnnsoda,"Ditches the Gritty Documentary-Style of the Original, But Manages to Be Disturbingly Realistic Nonetheless.",8,16 March 2009,"""The Last House on the Left"" is a remake of the 1972 Wes Craven exploitation thriller, which was itself a remake of Ingmar Bergman's 1960 Swedish masterpiece ""The Virgin Spring"". This film, which is a take on Craven's version of the story, follows Mari (Sarah Paxton), a teenage girl who is staying at with her parents (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter) at their remote summer house. She takes the family car into town to meet up with her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac) on the day of their arrival. The two girls end up crossing paths with a boy named Justin, who is about their age - but unfortunately for them, Justin's father, Krug (Garrett Dillahunt) is a nihilistic prison escapee, teamed with his girlfriend, Sadie (Riki Lindhome) and brother, Francis (Aaron Paul), all three of them criminals. The girls wind up being taken into the woods where they are brutalized, Paige being murdered and Mari left for dead. By an ironic twist of fate, the gang winds up seeking refuge in the summer home with Mari's parents. But it isn't long before Mari makes it back home, and her mom and dad go to extreme measures to avenge their daughter.Wes Craven's 1972 film ""The Last House on the Left"" was a brutal, sadistic piece of exploitation cinema that is still shocking to this day. While it is low budget, it is considered by many to be one of the best horror movies of its time. And Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" is a critically acclaimed film that is hailed by many to this day. So, with two solid films behind it, it wasn't a surprise that this remake on this same story was good as well. This film throws out the gritty, documentary- style that the '72 film had, but still manages to present everything very realistically. The plot here is reworked a little from the original, but the changes that are made don't hurt the film at all, in fact I think they strengthen it. The fates of the characters are a little different, and the circumstances which bring the girls to the criminals are different as well, but quite plausible in real life.As for the most important piece to this story and the main crux of it all - that being the presentation of violence - it is highly unsettling. I was worried that the filmmakers may have toned it down in comparison to the original's presentation of it, but they don't - in fact, some scenes were even worse. The repercussions of violence between humans in this story is prominent and one of the main themes, so it's important that it is depicted competently. Violence is an ugly, awful thing, so why present it as anything otherwise? This was one of the ideas behind Craven's work, and I'm glad these filmmakers stuck to that. There are a handful of scenes in this film that had me looking away, most prominently the scene in which Mari is brutally raped while her friend, Paige, lies on the ground dying after being stabbed numerous times. It's not a pretty sight, and is entirely savage and flat-out devastating in its presentation. The girls' struggle is heartbreaking, and both of them (Paxton particularly) play their parts extremely well. You know what's about to come, and you know there's not a thing you can do about it.Audience satisfaction comes in the form of Mari's parents, played by Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter, who find themselves housing the criminals who have just violated and nearly killed their daughter, along with her friend. Potter and Goldwyn are excellent here, and their interactions with each other when they begin to take revenge are interesting to say the least. The audience is clapping their hands as they violently off each of the bad guys, sometimes with even more brutality in mind than the criminals. And this is where the interesting part comes in, and we are posed the question - are Mari's parents justified in taking these matters into their own hands? We as the audience, who have just endured the unspeakable violence inflicted on the two teenage girls, can jump up and say yes - but is it really okay? This element of the story is what I think sets it apart from most horror films, because it poses a question that is extremely difficult to answer, and challenges you to put yourself in the parents' shoes.As for our criminals, they are each played quite well. Some have complained that they aren't threatening enough, but I personally thought there were no problems with that. To add in more complications, the son of the group's ringleader is unable to bring himself to the nihilistic level that his father and the others have made as a way of life, which makes for some more interesting matters to arise as the revenge begins to unfold. As for the conclusion of the film, this is the only area that I felt a little let down on. The microwave gag was a little over-the-top if you ask me. However, I dismissed it as the song ""Dirge"" by Death in Vegas played over the credits, with numerous shots of the house in the background - so fitting.Overall, ""The Last House on the Left"" '09 is a solid remake that manages to shock, disturb, and ultimately question its audience. It's not a movie for everybody, and is much more harsh than the casual popcorn horror flick, so beware of that. The acting is superb from all involved, topped with some nice cinematography and a few appropriately artsy shots. But above all, I am glad the filmmakers didn't water down the violence, because if they had, the catharsis of the last thirty minutes could have felt a little undeserved on the villains' part. Surprisingly good film. 8/10.",The Last House on the Left
51,davispittman,Very well made thriller,8,31 December 2015,"The Last House on the Left (2009) Is a well made thriller that is worth a watch some time. Sara Paxton was really great in her role as Mary, she really showcases her mature acting. I thought all the actors in this film did a pretty great job as a matter of fact. The assailants here really convinced the audience of how sick and twisted they really were, I mean these people are messed up, as they should be. Yes, the rape scene and the violence overall is very graphic and realistic. The attack scene really did need to be both realistic and pretty graphic, in order to portray the feelings and emotions that the viewer should have, so I thought that was done well. The only scene I thought was too over the top as far as violence, was the scene with the garbage disposal, I thought that was kinda unnecessary. The parents in this movie really held their own and did very well in their roles! I loved how they portrayed their characters! I wasn't a huge fan of how the film ended, I wish it would've ended a little differently, really it's just the final minute I had some trouble with. 8/10 for the last house on the left.",The Last House on the Left
52,Jonny_Numb,And the Remake Road Leads to Nowhere,7,19 March 2009,"If you hated all the jarring elements that made Wes Craven's original ""Last House on the Left"" such a notorious and divisive exercise in social commentary and clinical horror, then this remake is just for you. And I'll admit that Craven's own (self-admitted) amateur directorial status and the inclusion of seemingly inappropriate comic relief (in the form of two scene-padding cops), and the collection of banjo tunes (provided by star David Hess) made for an unevenyet also unshakableexperience. Somehow, these disparate elements, mixed with a penchant for uncomfortably personal documentary realism, made for a harrowing, and ultimately thoughtful, reflection of the Vietnam era that is still effective today.""Last House 2009"" cannot be faulted for being faithful to its parent while setting its own ambitions unrealistically high, but it makes for a jarring experience all its own. Some things never change, I guess.Greek director Dennis Iliadis takes the reins from Craven, keeping the beats of the original intact while showing a distinctly (and often distractingly) commercial sensibility toward the proceedings. Gone are the invasive close-ups, the authentically anguished cries, and the nagging sense that it wasn't ""only a movie...only a movie...only a movie."" ""Last House 2009"" is a model of slick technique and deliberate art-direction that portends a greater, more nihilistic cruelty while trying to underline the importance of the family unit...even if that family is a group of cold-blooded, homicidal killers.The film begins on an effective note: two cops transporting Krug (Garret Dillahunt""No Country for Old Men""), a notorious rapist and murderer, to a maximum-security prison, when a trio of accomplices stage a nighttime breakout. The scene is handled with such unbridled, cringe-worthy brutality that, for a couple of minutes, my faith in this film capturing the potency of its parent seemed very promising. We then cut to the Collingwood family: father John (Tony Goldwyn), an ER doctor; mother Emma (Monica Potter); and teenage daughter Mari (Sara Paxton), a champion swimmer. Making a trek to their secluded summer home, scenes of placid, mundane domesticity give way to horror when Mari and her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac) are accosted by unassuming teen Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), who takes them back to a seedy motel room for an afternoon of pot-smoking. But it turns out Justin is Krug's son, and from there the story descends into darkness that is actually weakened by the film's technical proficiency.One of Craven's strongest assets were his villains, who brought a steely yet sickly humorous verisimilitude to their rolesit was a cast of distinctive, unique faces, and the performances were disturbingly free of inhibition; as a result, there was an aura of reality of their crimes. The biggest problem with ""Last House 2009"" is the gang itself: while their actions are indeed repulsive, they often feel like artificial constructs of the script (the rape scene, for instance, feels more obligatory than naturalistic) instead of reflections of character. The emphasis on (and contradictions of) ""family values"" from both ends of the spectrum is an interesting avenue of exploration, but it blunts the characters' edges. Here, Krug comes across with all the presence of a half-drunk, would-be badass lobbying for Tough-Love Dad of the Year; his accomplices are little more than one-dimensional ciphers who convey callous brutality, but not ""evil."" The performances of Goldwyn and Potteras the bereaved parents turned savageare better, encompassing a palpably anguished rage, to the point where we almost (but not quite) buy their blood-soaked retribution. Their vengeance is cathartic and visceral, but not as paradoxically satisfying and unsettling as the brutality dished out in the original (and the climactic murder is straight out of a lame B-movie).""Last House 2009"" is as slickly produced as any film in the current Torture Porn pantheon, and while some might argue an ironic, postmodern ""relevance"" analogizing the events in this film to the eight years of rape and pillage under the Bush Administration, its only real goal is to make cash registers ring before this trend is finally dead and buried.",The Last House on the Left

Of all the things that are spot on in this dire thriller, I have to give hats off to the sound design.

So believe me when I tell you I haven't been this scared, from abduction, survival and revenge thrillers, since High Tension (2003) or Incident In a Ghost Land (2018).

55,Samiam3,Freaky flick,7,3 September 2009,"Cult horror legend Wes Craven teams up with Sean Cunningham (who I don't think needs any introduction either) to remake another of his films. The first one being The Hills Have Eyes. I only saw bits of the original Last House on the Left, but what I saw struck me as a grainy, sick little picture. Remake or not, Dennis Illiades' version of Last House on the Left, does its job quite well. Even if it is just another, guilty pleasure, horror film, out to make money, it is sufficient to me.For those who have not seen the original, allow me to reiterate. Mary Collingwood and her family are taking a driving trip to their cottage. Shortly after they arrive, Mary borrows the car to go spend the evening with her friend Paige (against her mother's wishes). At the store where Paige works, the girls meet a strange looking boy called Justin who takes them back to his motel room to smoke pot. But things take a nasty turn when Justin's family shows up, and they are on the run from the police. Paiga and Mary are abducted, and what follows is a story of darkness and perversion that will make you keep repeating, it is only a movie...only a movie...only a movie.Of course, it is impossible to see flawlessness in movies like this, but once you see enough of them, you sort of subconsciously put the problems at the back of your in while you watch. I'm not sure what kind of advice to give for big fans of the original, but if you are approaching the film with little or no prior knowledge of Craven, you will find guilty pleasure in this movie.",The Last House on the Left
56,raulfaust,A new kind of army,5,7 January 2015,"First, I'd like to state that I haven't seen the original version of this, so I'm not making any comparisons between them. ""The Last House on the Left"" is a movie that involves desperation and vengeance of a family after their daughter get beaten up and raped by a group of violent people. The story is OK, and I see no reason to demerit the writers. Photography directing is more than OK; it's wonderful. The nostalgic colors used in here bring the darkness this movie deserves. However, one of the aspects that really annoyed me was the bad acting from the whole cast; no one was able to express the feelings the characters must have gone through. For instance, whilst the couple's daughter was bleeding on the floor, they seemed too calm for someone who was about to lose a descendant. Parents, especially mothers, usually scream and get desperate in these situations, but in here, they showed no emotion at all. Also, the directing was extremely poor and unable to demonstrate any credibility in the fighting scenes; the spectator could easily notice they weren't making any strong movement during the fights. All in all, to wrap things up, ""The Last House on the Left"" is a film that I wouldn't see again, nor indicate to friends who like the genre.",The Last House on the Left

The couple who live there welcome them with open arms and lets them stay at the guest house. The girl left for dead in the lake manages to survive and crawls back to her home....the same home the kidnappers are staying at. The parents decide to take revenge on the gang.This is a remake of Wes Craven's original with the same name. I've never seen the original, but have heard that it is pretty disturbing. Having seen my fair share of disturbing films (thank you Cannibal Holocaust) I didn't know what to expect from a film that was a remake of such disturbing subject matter. This up to date version seems to unbalanced and tame (and yes I saw the unrated version).I say unbalanced because it seems to want to be two different films, in terms of genre and style. The last act and the only parts worth watching, seem to fall under the 'torture porn' genre. Think Hostel, Saw and countless other horror films that rely on gross out gore to entertain the audience. I've got nothing wrong with this, I love my gore in horror flicks. This film has some great deaths, even if they are a bit over the top. Hammers, garbage disposals, microwaves, all these are great death scenes. Yet the rest of the film (save for the rape bits) seem to belong to another film all together.The acting is by the numbers, yet I found Dillahunt and Goldwyn are the stand out performances. Dillahunt, from Deadwood, plays Krug, the lead gang member. He walks the line of being nice, at least to me. He plays it nice, yet his actions are despicable. I say he played it nice because Aaron Paul, who plays another member of the gang is pretty ""evil"" and over the top. Goldwyn plays the father and has intense moments that is all played through his eyes. The two of them have a fight scene that was not in the original and it seems too fake, just to fill some time.The story is predictable, even if you haven't seen the original and is by the numbers. In a film like this, I was expecting more shock moments. The final act had two, yet this film cries for more. As a remake, I;d say I've seen worse (Prom Night), but there are certainly better (Dawn of the Dead) remakes out there.Last House On The Left is a well made film, don't get me wrong. If you're into this type of horror stuff then it might satisfy you. I found it to be pretty basic. I still want to check out the original, one that I'm sure will do more damage than this could ever imagine to. I recommend this to fans of the genre (not the horror genre, the torture genre).

If yes, The Last House on The Left was made for you.It's a throwback to an earlier time when horror didn't only equate a zombie outbreak or hauntings, it could be something as simple and as realistic as a few decent people running afoul of..well, some not so decent people. The villains were often nothing more than sadistic, psychotic avatars of pure evil. These kinds of movies weren't exactly subtle, and they could be almost exploitative in their use of violence and carnage. Not for the faint of heart, to say the least.And The Last House on the Left is a remake of one of those movies. Which means that like the original, it doesn't pull many punches. Some scenes are downright difficult to watch. It's grim and bleak, and even the eventual triumph of the protagonists is marked by vengeful savagery. I can't really say that I ""enjoyed"" most of it, but it did appeal to the part of me that likes to see evil get its comeuppance.

I love revenge flicks. The only turn-off in watching these films is having to watch the set up of having bad people do bad things to loving, good people. However, once you overcome this hurdle, you finally get to see the catharsis: Having justice be done and have bad people suffer from what they did. It's strangely uplifting, yet it presents a lot of morals and themes. This is TLHOTL.LHOTL is like a more extreme version of TAKEN. The great thing about this film is that it could have ended up like another sleazy remake that preferred style over substance. The difference is that there's actually substance, and quite a bit of it. It presents a time-ticking morality tale that's actually quite moving and humane, although the things that are explored here may say otherwise. And it's this very reason why this film works.The film explores some disturbing sides of human nature and shows it in a realistic way. Where one film may fade out too early in a horrendously enduring scene, this film has the camera linger in what seems like hours. Where one film may present violence in a cartoonish way, this film gets down to the grittiness of all of it. And it's this grounded reality that the film is able to express its message to the audience. However, the very reasons I'm praising this film is probably the very reasons another may hate this film.And I have to say this now: This film is not for everyone. There are some very disturbing scenes in here where I can see people walking out in disgust, but it all comes down to personal tastes. Now getting away from the controversial side of the film, I need to say that this is a well made film. It's a really well made film. From the gorgeous cinematography, to the tight editing, to the beautiful score, it's just really great.Even the performances were all fantastic. Sara Paxton, who was known for more comedic roles, does a surprisingly great job that I was thinking, ""Woah! Where did that come from?!"" Martha MacIsaac, who also starred in the hit SUPERBAD, also shows a serious side of herself in this film. The two lead parents, Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter, are commendable to say the least. And lastly, the other supporting castmembers, mostly Garret Dillahunt, Aaron Paul, and Riki Lindhome, pull off a very convincing group of villains.It's great to see a film that doesn't follow style over substance like most horror films, that has terrific performances from the castmembers all around, that is well written, and that is genuinely well made. This is an effective thriller that gets its point across and also has us question ourselves what the tagline asks: ""If bad people hurt someone you love, how far would you go to hurt them back?"" It's this irony that makes this film so great. If there is one major flaw in this film, I have to say it's the last scene. You'll understand why once you see it. Overall, it's not for the faint of heart. Beware when I say that. Oh, and look out for director Dennis Iliadis. He has a bright future ahead of him.",The Last House on the Left

I didn't regret the choice but at the end I have to admit that there were some unnecessary violent bloody scenes. The story therefore was well packed with suspense and twists and also the house at the lake offered an ideal ambiance for the showdown. It's no doubt one of the best movie from director Wes Craven even if it's a remake. If you can look away from some brutality and you are looking for a real nightmare thriller so this one could work.

63,punishmentpark,Sara Paxton be praised.,5,16 August 2015,"I saw the original (1972, Wes Craven) too long ago to make a fair comparison, so I'll leave that alone for now. One thing I can say, is that this remake certainly had its strong points that made it worth the watch.The most important strong point is the rape sequence. Sara Paxton plays her part eerily well, and, even if it's not very long sequence (within, indeed, quite a long scene), it feels like it. Other strong points are most of the other acting (Martha MacIsaac, Garret Dillahunt, though Monica Potter was rather annoying), the introduction of the characters, the realistic feel that is initially achieved and the cinematographic sense of the director.Unfortunately, there is a lot that does nót go as well. For one thing, and it's not like I hadn't expected this, the revenge of the parents (starting from the moment the bad guys come by their house) is rather dragged out and mostly leans on the (inane) prolonging of tension and the gory excess (the latter was adequate, by the way, but the final 'wave' was a bit too much here). And, after such a realistic start and subsequent raping and killing, for once you'd wish there was a director who would take on what follows with more sense of originality - in any way, shape or form.Another big problem is the soundtrack. In the very beginning it had its moments, but at some point it seemed like it was even more important than the leading roles.5 out of 10 is all I can squeeze out for this one, and that may seem a bit much, but Paxton did an utterly commendable job.",The Last House on the Left
64,dunmore_ego,Ingmar Bergman is spinning in his grave,5,21 September 2009,"What pisses me off about THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is that nowhere do the filmmakers mention - not in advertising, not in screen credits and not even in the Special Features on the DVD - that this movie is ripped straight from Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING (1951, aka JUNGFRUKÄLLAN).Instead, it gives screen credit to Wes Craven, who created the ""original"" LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT in 1972: ""Based on the story written and directed by Wes Craven."" No, it's not. The story of villains who molest a young girl and then seek refuge unknowingly in the house of that girl's parents was written by Ulla Isaksson. Craven rewrote the story to pander to American bloodthirstiness.Bland Tony Goldwyn and blander Monica Potter are the parents. Sara Paxton is the virgin teen - so slim, smooth, innocent and sexy, only one thought crosses our minds: she just has to die. Martha MacIsaac (cutie Becca from SUPERBAD) is the pot-smoking teen friend.Garret Dillahunt (looking like the sperm-child of Jason Patric, Robe Lowe and Dennis Miller) is the villain; his vaguely lesbian-goth chick, Riki Lindhome (who knows how to please viewing audiences by getting her cans out constantly); his teen son, Spencer Treat Clark (from GLADIATOR, 2000), who is sickened by his father's crimes and beaten for being so ""unmanly."" Aaron Paul is Garret's partner in crime.Whereas Bergman's film focused on the STORY, Iliadis's film - like Craven's before it - focuses on the GORY. Here, the parents of the molested child turn into the monsters they despise. In Bergman's film, the father (Max von Sydow) dispatches the villains quickly and efficiently, like a god come to life, exacting justice; in Iliadis's film, there's mangling and bashing and stabbing and a claw hammer to the skull and microwaving someone's head gratuitously - in effect, the parents become the ""slashers,"" an ironic twist on the teen-slaying genre.In Bergman's film, the father also kills the young kid in the gang of villains, who did not participate in the crime, but was an abettor for doing nothing to stop it. That was powerful stuff. With the gutless MPAA breathing down America's neck, it is absolutely no surprise that Spencer Treat Clark is spared here.There seems to be no storyline in this movie, outside of Isaksson's blatantly plagiarized premise. There is some tenuous allusion to THE VIRGIN SPRING when the family realizes the quickest way to the hospital is upriver by boat. But they can't find the boat keys! The script might have been just ten pages long with the amount of padding on screen - the rape scene itself goes on and on for so long, it's as if the director and editor just sat there touching themselves and letting it run. It's not even tragic after a certain point - it's just hot.Further evidence that these filmmakers are just trying to gross us out: the father is a doctor; while he is putting stitches in a villain's nose, they have a blackout. The father takes a giant flashlight and - instead of shining it on the guy's nose to finish his needle stroke - goes outside to fix the circuit breakers first, leaving the needle sticking half-through the nose. Some kind of doctor! There is no characterization, no character arcs - the only throughline seems to be ""trying to find the boat keys."" This story opened deep, dark questions about the human condition: how far will you go to defend your loved ones?; how sweet can revenge be if you have to stoop to the level of the villains?; can you go through with taking a human life at all? There is one scene where the father and mother exchange a glance that is laden with these unspoken conundrums, while they kill one of the villains... by mangling his hand in the sink and sticking a claw hammer in his head. Guess they figured the answers.Then those questions get replaced by bigger ones, like ""Where can I get psychiatric help?"" as the father seems to slip into the Teen Slasher Movie world himself when we see him cutting open the ringleader's back to sever his spinal column in order to paralyze him from the neck down, and then - while the ringleader is conscious - stick his head in a microwave and set it on high. Now that's just plain wrong! Everyone knows the setting for human head is two minutes on 'medium.' It is a complicated, time-consuming procedure and we cannot quite tell chronologically when the father performs his insane little operation, but consider: if he did it BEFORE he rushed his raped daughter to the hospital, he is crazy; if he did it AFTER coming back from the hospital, he's still crazy! And the moral of the story is: Remember Where You Put The Boat Keys.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",The Last House on the Left
65,Pumpkin_Man,A Decent Attempt at Remaking a True Horror Classic!!!,8,19 July 2018,"I recently bought Arrow Video's 3-disc Blu-Ray of Wes Craven's ultimate classic, The Last House on the Left. I watched all three cuts in one day, so I decided to watch the remake afterward. I have seen this before, but it's been years. After re-watching it, I still very much prefer the original, but the revenge scenes in this one were gorier and better than the original. Garret Dillahunt (Fear the Walking Dead) made a very mean and more brutal Krug. Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) was cool to see as Francis, Krug's brother. Riki Lindhome was sexy but deadly as Sadie, Krug's girlfriend. The acting was better and more believable this time around. On his way to prison, Krug is broken free by Francis and Sadie. Meanwhile, Mari Collingwood head to their lakehouse for a little vacation. Mari wants to go out and spend time with her best friend, Paige. They make the mistake of asking Justin for some pot (Justin happens to be Krug's son) When they get to the hotel, Krug and his gang takes them hostage. While driving through the woods, the girls try to make a break for it, but they get caught again and slowly tortured. When Mari is beaten, raped, shot and left for dead, a storm is coming and Krug and his gang just happen to seek refuge from Mari's parents. The tension rises when John and Emma Collingwood find their daughter savagely beaten and learn that the people they took in are the ones who attacked her. Soon, the parents will become just as psychotic as the killers. Overall, it's a very good remake. It feels more realistic, but as I said, I still love the original better. It's only a movie. It's only a movie...only a movie. If you love Wes Craven's original classic, you'll love LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT!!!",The Last House on the Left

I should have known better. But every week I watch ""Breaking Bad"" raptured with Aaron Paul, and I had to watch him in a feature film.All that I got out of watching this was how bad horror films are and it was a good reminder that I'm not missing anything. The film starts by giving us back-stories to our protagonists, all of which were unnecessary, as the rest of the film is as follows: girl gets herself in bad situation, meet creepy bad guys, have four minute rape scene, family meets creepy bad guys, and then revenge. I guess there's a plot in that, but no point.I was asked if the actors did a good job, my answer was, I don't know. They weren't characters, just vehicles for destruction. Just as this movie is not a film, just a channel for gruesome violence.If you don't watch horror movies, don't start with ""The Last House on the Left"".",The Last House on the Left
67,baumer,Quite good for a remake to a classic Grindhouse film.,8,1 April 2009,"This does contain some very big spoilers, but nothing you haven't seen in the trailer.I can still remember when I heard there was going to be a remake to Wes Craven's 1972 debut film. I told anyone who would listen that it was a mistake as there was simply no possible way to duplicate, even remotely, the feel of despair, disgust, shock, horror and hopelessness that the original made you feel. The original is without a doubt the most disturbing film I have ever seen. You can check my review of it out here at IMDb. The original was made with no studio backing, no budget and by two of horrors future icons. These are the same guys that would bring to life Freddy and Jason.I was not wrong in my preconceived notions. The remake is nothing like the original. And really, how could it be? It is a studio film. It has Hollywood producers and if you wanted a film like the one in 1972, you would get an X-rating. As it stands, we have an R-rated film and it does a very nice job of retelling the story for a new generation of horror fans.Is this one any good? Definitely. In fact, it is probably the best horror film of the year so far. Just because it cannot compare to the original, doesn't take away from the quality of the remake.As the story goes, Mary and her parents are vacationing for the summer at their cottage, the last house on the left. Mary is a well to do kid, whose father is a doctor and her mother is some sort of business débutante. In spite of their wealth, they come across as a nice family and nothing like the pretentious and snotty family that they could of been in another horror film. Just before they head to their cottage for the summer, we see the story of Krug, who is being taken to a penitentiary for some crime. He is rescued by his brother and girlfriend. And they decide the best thing to do is kill the two police officers holding Krug. The killings are long and drawn out and they are violent. Krug and his gang are not nice people. This is established from the outset.Mary decides to go to town to see her friend Paige and soon they are getting some weed from Justin, who happens to be Krug's kid. Krug and his merry band of miscreants come back to the hotel and they kidnap Mary and Paige and make off with them. At this point, nothing terrible has happened to the girls. Paige tried to escape from the hotel and she is beaten up a bit. I didn't really feel fear for Mary and Paige, not yet anyway. That all changes when they get to the forest. In a shocking moment, Paige is killed as both Krug and Francis stick a knife in her back and her stomach. This was the first time in the film that it felt like a semblance of the 1972 film. Then Mary is raped. The rape is done as violently but without any nudity as possible. This does take away from the disgust of the act, but again, an R rating had to be achieved for this film. Soon Mary is running for her life and she is shot and presumed dead.Up until now the film is good. Where it gets great and showcases Dennis Iliadis' talent is when the killers end up at The Collingwood's doorstep in need of help and shelter for the night. They of course have no idea these are Mary's parents and when the parents, played beautifully by Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn discover the killers, their plan for retribution is carried out with no pity, no fear and no remorse.The tag line for this film is a perfect appetizer for what you are about to see. ""If bad people hurt someone you love, how far would you go to hurt them back?"" The problem with so many revenge films, horror or other genres, is that the bad guys wreak havoc on the good guys for 95 minutes. Then in the last 5 minutes of the film, the good guys get their meager revenge and then the bad guys die. There is not a lot to cheer about. I need to see the bad guys get what's coming to them. And in a film where innocence is lost and a young virgin is raped and dehumanized, it is even more tantamount to see the bad guys get theirs. The Last House on the Left takes care of this beautifully. One of the signs that this is an effective film is that people talk about the merits and reality of whether or not a microwave would really blow a man's head up even with the door open, as opposed to whether or not that man deserved to have his head blown off. At this point, you just want to see something terrible happen to the iniquitous, evil bastards on screen. You don't care what it is, but it has to be cruel and maniacal. It won't help you forget the rape, but it will mitigate the act knowing that retribution was served.The Last House on the Left is a very well made film with wonderful performances from the good guys, the bad guys and everyone in between. It is not for the weak at heart or those easily offended. However, if you want to see a truly disturbing film, watch the original. But be forewarned, it is a disturbing and brutal film. The early 70's was a different time for film making. You would never get away with what you did then in todays movie making political forum. But this remake does a very nice job of trying. Kudos to all involved.8.5/10",The Last House on the Left
68,jaredmobarak,Always go for the gold  The Last House on the Left,7,18 July 2009,"I don't usually get disgusted or squeamish when it comes to horror and gore, but after viewing The Last House on the Left remake, one of the many old Wes Craven films getting reworked, I have to admit, it was pretty harrowing. Does making me tense up and await some scenes' conclusions make it an effective suspense/thriller? I'm not so sure. The plot line is thin, the result obvious, so as far as what will happen, there is very little question or anticipation. That being said, however, the death scenes and brutality are very much shrouded in the unknown. What one would expect to be the usual horror flick kills become methodical, realistic, and unbearable. Fists are thrown, knives are stabbed, and characters are slowed and tired. No one is supernatural, no one is above his own mortality, and, frankly, while that fact may not make it scary per se, it does make you question your motivations to keep sitting there watching it all.The gist of the story is as follows: a family, (mother, father, and daughter), goes to the lake for a vacation from clients and patients. It is a year since Ben, the older child, passed away, and they are all just looking to enjoy themselves and relax despite his absence and the work that has distracted them and gotten them through the rough time. Daughter Mari is seventeen and looking to have more fun than just hanging with her parents and working on her swim speed. So, on the first night of their arrival, she asks to borrow the car and visit an old friend, Paige. The two find themselves meeting a boy their age that tells them he has some primo weed at his motel. His father and the woman he's sleeping with, as well as his uncle aren't supposed to be back, but of course, that assumption is wrong, ushering in the start of the chaos and carnage. Why you ask? Oh, because, as the opening scene shows, the boy's father is an escaped, murdering psychopath excised from the cop car transporting him by his girl and brother. Let's just say that their arrival to the motel turns the kiddies' party up a few notches.It is not all about this motley crew's doings with the two young girls who have seen their faces and most likely will tell the police, no, most of the film's action comes afterwards. You see, Mari escapes and slowly makes her way back home to her parents. The catch, however, is that the Manson family has already arrived there, thinking Mari has been killed, and playing house to earn a peaceful night indoors from the lovely and accommodating Collingwoods. So, what starts out as a brutal look into the activities of miscreants and how they treat those in their captivity becomes a revenge flick of epic proportions as the mister and missus decide to achieve retribution themselves for the state their daughter has been left in. Phones dead, power being supplied by a generator, and the sky opened up pouring rain on top of them, the Collingwoods play judge, jury, and executioner with deft skill and precision, or at least as much as can be expected from two suburbanites out to protect themselves and the child they have left.It must be said that this thing is shot very nicely. Straight from the brief opening credit sequence, (no names listed until the end), as we dodge through trees, illuminated one at a time in the stark darkness as we move past, to some gorgeous underwater frames, to some inventive blocking and use of focus changing, the camera-work is intriguing in its own rite. As for the acting, it's pretty darn good for a genre film of this kind. Martha MacIsaac, as Paige, annoyed me a bit, but no complaints otherwise. I really liked Sara Paxton as Mari, especially her cool, collected self as she attempts to escape her captors; Monica Potter is a loving, yet strong mother figure that is willing to do what's necessary for her family; and Tony Goldwyn is pretty badass once he realizes the foursome staying under his roof are the ones who raped and left his daughter for dead. He will always be the bad guy in Ghost for me, but it's nice to see him back on the big screen as he rarely gets to play in a high profile release. And then there is Spencer Treat Clark as Justin, the boy who unknowingly brought the young girls into the path of his violent dad. His vulnerability and inability to do anything to help is hard to watch.What is really trying to watch, however, besides some gruesome moments during the revenge portion of the story, (claw hammer and garbage disposal anyone?), is the graphically realistic rape sequence. This scene is definitely not for the faint of heart because, as I read in an interview by Garret Dillahunt, he of psychopath patriarch Krug fame here, Paxton told him to go for it and make the moment as brutal as possible. And, trust me, it is. In the mud, clothes ripped, abstract close-ups of body parts unable to move under his strength, and everyone else watching, it becomes even more disturbing when finished as the camera lingers, in slow motion, on Paxton as she gets up—dirty and defiled—the comment by Dillahunt to his son, ""you don't know what you missed"", the only noise. Aaron Paul as the uncle and Riki Lindhome as the female companion are good and creepy in a horror film kind of way, but it's Dillahunt that adds just the right mix of real life malice. A formidable force, able to smile and bring people in close before pouncing, he is one scary monster making all that follows his opening moment of choking a cop to death while holding a photo of his kids in front of his eyes possible, reviling, and effective horror.",The Last House on the Left
69,adamscastlevania2,Somewhat nasty and nothing really more,5,1 November 2014,"(49%) As far as Hollywood's recent and largely quite pointless horror remake obsession goes, including the rehashing of such gems as the Texas chainsaw massacre, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm street, Maniac etc, this is OK, but still at the end of the day a somewhat lazily controversial multiplex filler. In all fairness this is quite well put together, the direction is solid, and the performances for a sleazy revenge thriller are nothing to complain about. For anyone bar the most timid cinema goer this isn't going to overly offend, and really the violent attacks on the two kidnapped girls offer the only truly nasty parts of the whole movie. While everything else feels oddly difficult to even slightly shock as the scumbag characters 100% had it coming, so the message that all violence, just or not, is awful doesn't really work here. By the end this is just about worth a look for horror fans, but it won't become a cult hit like the original.",The Last House on the Left

71,juliankennedy23,Last House on the Left (2009) ... Location Location Location,7,8 October 2009,"Last House on the Left: 5 out of 10: Close but no cigar. Honestly anyone who remembers 1972’s shocking version of the Virgin Spring had to know this remake would pull back the reigns. It would be like a remake of “I Spit on your Grave”... just not likely in these conservative and commercial times. Well at least they did not make it PG-13.They screw up they remake early with two changes. The bad guys are bad guys from the start. There is no connection with the audience. No sense that they are travelling down a path as well; they do not connect with the audience as the hippies of the first film did. There is no sense that they are exploring there boundaries or challenging themselves. They start fully formed as black hats.The second mistake is moving the story out of a regular middle class neighborhood and into a millionaires’ nature retreat. There is something shocking about violence among the shag carpeting and wood paneling of suburbia (The original movie was from 1972 after all) that is lost with the large Architectural Digest house perfectly clean and decorated. (Though with the filmiest wooden furniture this side of a thirties Western).The rape is much less graphic than the original and the sense of sadism and intimacy of the first film is lost. On the plus side, Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter give great performances as the parents and the revenge scenes are not completely without a sense of fun.If this film was called something else, I might have gone easier on it. As a Last House on the Left film, it is a glossy shadow of its predecessor.",The Last House on the Left
72,cchase,Remake Of A Classic '70's Shocker Undermined By A Ridiculous Ending...,7,5 September 2009,"First of all, I was a little surprised at myself for being intrigued by the trailer for this particular ""remake/reboot"", whatever you want to call it. It had been years since I had viewed the 'uncut' version of the the original film, which was an uneven, but unforgettable and unparalleled exercise in the graphic display of man's capability for inhumanity to others of his species. One time was all I needed to watch it, because once was nearly more than enough.Nevertheless, I see so few movies these days, let alone horror movies. The contempt most studios have for them is palpable, the way that films from the last two or three decades are being remade and watered down to the lowest PG-13 common denominator, for maximum profits made with minimum overhead. And for the most part it shows.But with original filmmakers Craven and Sean Cunningham on board as executive producers, I saw a faint glimmer of hope that this wouldn't come across as yet another piece of Hollywood tripe. So now, having seen it in its Unrated form, I can weigh in on the pros and cons. First, the pros: there are more than enough nods to the original to satisfy the die-hards out there who can recite the movie chapter and verse, and I give kudos to both the director, Dennis Illiadis, and screenwriters Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth for showing a little backbone in the way they incorporated these acknowledgments. For example: there are two cops in this new version as in the predecessor, and their presence as the bumbling backwoods ""comedy relief"" was one of the more controversial aspects of the first film. Fans and the curious need not be worried: what happens with these cops is anything but comedic, and that particular subplot gets resolved quick, fast and in a hurry, as if to effectively ""fix"" the past mistake.Another questionable ""pro"" is the way the sequence in the woods is handled. Mercifully, the torture/disembowelment is not nearly as graphic or protracted and Paige's demise is pretty swift. What happens instead is that the rape of Mari by Krug is the longest, most realistic ordeal I have seen yet on film. Several times I wanted to either get up and leave the room or put the movie on 'pause' - it was that disturbing...more so than in the original, which I didn't think was possible. I don't know if I should congratulate the actors and the director, or recommend that they all go into intensive therapy. If the sequence was meant to justify the parents' actions later on in the film, it definitely succeeded.As for the cons, one of the first of many is the subplot about the dead older brother. I don't remember any of this from the original, nor the sense of marital strain caused by the residue of the tragedy. And the additional wrinkle of the father being a surgeon in a hospital ER. I know that details like these go a long way to ""flesh out"" the characters, but one of the things that made the original so shocking was the simplicity. We didn't know the girls, the killers or the parents that well and we didn't have to. It was about the action of the senseless slaughter of two young women, and the violently equal and opposite reaction from a couple of ""decent human beings"" who accessed their inner savageness to avenge the death of a loved one. The BIGGEST con, of course (at least for me) was the ending. Everything leading up to it was brutal, violent and harrowing (ignoring some glaring plot holes), but not outside the realm of possibility. The only way I can define the absurdity of the ending is that it was like watching what would've happened if De Palma had grafted the climax of THE FURY onto the end of BLOW OUT. It takes you out of everything that happened before with a cartoonish, jaw- dropping sequence. Which is a shame, because the rest of the film is actually not bad for a remake. The casting fared a little better, but the anonymity of the actors from the original wasn't there to lend this a more realistic feel. Not to say the performances were bad. Tony Goldwyn (GHOST) and Monica Potter (ALONG CAME A SPIDER) are very good as Mari's parents, and a buffed-out Garret Dillahunt (DEADWOOD, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES) goes for the gold as Krug, nearly out-smarming the role's creator, David Hess. But unlike the remainder of the cast, their familiarity keeps you from that sense of having to repeat the old tag-line: ""It's Only A Movie...Only A Movie."" Sara Paxton and Martha McIsaac as Mari and Paige, respectively, are okay, but their biggest problem is underwritten roles, but especially in Paige's case. But the places that Paxton and Dillahunt had to go with that rape scene are hard to imagine, and I credit them for being able to trust one another to deliver something that raw and intense. Special note has to be made here to recognize Spencer Treat Clark as Krug's son, Justin, who comes across as much a victim of his father's psychotic sadism as anyone else in the movie. He is as vulnerable, sympathetic and memorable as a Ben Foster or Elijah Wood - keep your eye out for this young actor.All-in-all, I want to give LAST HOUSE an eight, but have to dock it a point for the ending. As much as the chief villain deserved to get his comeuppance, it would've been much more satisfying, less of a gimmick and more in keeping with the tone of the film, if Justin had been given the chance to blow the bastard's head off. Just my opinion.",The Last House on the Left
73,ajs-10,A bit too predictable... and no justice!,5,8 May 2010,"Back in 1972 Wes Craven wrote and directed a film called The Last House on the Left, I was a bit young to go and see it at the time and to this day it has still managed to elude my viewing. This is a remake of said film and, since I haven't seen the original, I can only judge it stand alone, so to speak.John and Emma Collingwood, along with their daughter Mari have just arrived at their lake house for a holiday. John is a doctor, and a pretty successful one at that, their holiday home even has a guest house! But I digress, here's a short summary before I tell you what I think.Having been busted out while on his way to prison, all round bad guy and psychopath, Krug just happens to be staying in a motel at a small town near the Collingwood's holiday home. With him are his psycho girlfriend Sadie, his crazy brother Francis and his teenage son Justin. Justin meets Mari and her friend Paige at the local store and invites them back to their motel room to try some dope. Krug and the rest of the gang return and, having made the front page of the paper are not best pleased to find two 'civilians' there. Leaving town and taking the girls with them they take Mari's car and head out through the woods hoping to make it over the mountain to the freeway. Mari tries to make an escape as they're passing the end of her road, but the attempt fails and they crash the car. Incensed, Krug and his brother kill Paige and Krug rapes Mari, who makes another bid for freedom, but is shot while making a swim for it across the lake. The weather is closing in and the gang make it to the Collingwood's house. They take them in and patch up Francis, who broke his nose in the crash. The gang are put up in the guest house, but Justin, feeling guilty, leaves Mari's necklace for the Collingwood's to find. A noise outside brings them to find Mari battered and bruised lying on the porch. When they also find the necklace they realise who has attacked their daughter and now it's time for revenge! Technically, this film was quite well made, so there was obviously some money behind it. Unfortunately I found the story a bit too predictable and there was one fatal flaw that really was a let-down for me, but more of that later. Decent performances from all of the major players, honourable mentions go to Tony Goldwyn as John Collingwood, Monica Potter as Emma Collingwood, Garret Dillahunt as Krug, Aaron Paul as Francis, Spencer Treat Clark as Justin and Riki Lindhome as Sadie.So what's the fatal flaw, well, it's a big spoiler, so don't read on if you intend to see this film. The story ends with the family escaping across the lake and all the bad guys either dead or incapacitated, apart from Justin, who's in the boat with them. I can't believe they guy that caused the rape of one girl and the murder of another is allowed to escape without any kind of retribution! I'm afraid I felt cheated by this ending. As far as I'm concerned I can't recommend this one No justice!",The Last House on the Left
74,mario_c,Nice horror/suspense film with a credible plot and well built characters,8,20 January 2010,"Even knowing it's a remake from the 1972 Wes Craven's movie I won't do any comparisons to the original since I didn't see it yet So my comment will focus only on the present movie, ""forgetting"" it is a remake...That said I must tell you I did appreciate this movie! And I did it mostly because it's in the same line of other movies I've seen recently which have more realistic and credible plots. I mean it's a horror film, with a great number of ""horror movies features"", but it's done in a realistic way, what turns it ruder and uncomfortable. Especially when the viewer thinks: ""no, it not just happens in the movies, it could happen in real life""! It was mainly because of that I did appreciate this movie, but not only It has a good plot, great pace, nice suspense until the end and credible characters. The gore scenes are also well done and there're a few which are memorable, like that head explosion in the end! There's a lot of blood in this film but it's not its most valuable feature. I guess it's even stronger on the psychological side, because the tension built around all characters is really intense. As they play that deadly game as tension and suspense grows! All characters are well created but in this film my ""sympathy"" fell exclusively on the ""good characters"" side. I must say it happened very few times in my entire life from all movies I've watched, because I really use to hate support ""good"" vs ""bad"" characters, because people in really life are not as flat as they appear in some movies, exclusively good or bad (everyone has a good and a bad side, no one is that flat!). So, as a reaction to it, I tend to tolerate evil characters in the movies and especially appreciate films which don't have a happy end (when the ""good ones"" win!). I did it with FUNNY GAMES and a lot more But here in this movie something was different; I don't know how to explain that but there was something that made me create some true sympathy for the ""good"" characters against the ""evil"" ones. It's not usual in me, as told, but it happened here. Probably because of the way characters and plot were developed, I don't know All I can say right know is that I was relieved with that happy ending, and the ""head explosion"" scene was really pleasant! To sum up, it's a nice horror/suspense film with a credible plot and well built characters. I score it 8/10.",The Last House on the Left
75,acidburn-10,"Decent for a remake, should have pushed a bit more",6,8 April 2014,"During the 00's there were a lot of remakes flooding the theatres such as (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black X-Mas, Jason, The Hills Have Eyes and etc), very few were good but a lot of them were terrible and did nothing for its original movie only lessened it's quality. However ""Last House on the Left"" was one of those movies's that made a major impact and became notorious and to be honest I was surprised it took so long for that movie to be remade.Well I must say that this remake is actually quite decent, but gone is the grittiness from the original and here this movie has the more Hollywood polished feel. Which doesn't make it bad it just doesn't have quite the same impact as the original did. There are a few unsettling scenes like for instance the rape in this movie is very realistic and disgusting but was done much better in the original where it lasted forever in that, in this it's still shocking but nothing that hasn't been done before. I just feel that this new version should have been more shocking and pushed a lot more boundaries given it's time. Don't get me wrong it's still brutal, just not on a memorable level.The acting is very good though Garrett Dillahunt does pretty good as the new Krug, but not as intense but I am glad he didn't play just a carbon copy. Sara Paxton as Mari is a lot more innocent than the original and really makes you root for her more. Aaron Paul as Francis one of the pack members and Sadie (Riki Lindhome) both play they're parts well but lack chemistry and Spencer Treat Clark as the son Justin is okay but lacked the real father son dynamic but he had decent chemistry with Mari and Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter play the parents pretty decently making them worthy too root for.All in all ""The Last House On The Left"" while a decent stand alone movie will not likely to leave a everlasting impression, but still a good movie and should have pushed more boundaries than the original did, but to be honest stick with the original it's a lot more disturbing.",The Last House on the Left
76,DonFishies,"Disturbing, but far too predictable",5,19 August 2009,"When Wes Craven, the future horror legend, made The Last House on the Left back in the early 1970s, it had a simple concept: how far would you go to avenge the life of a loved one? Even with how uncomfortable and disturbing the film is, the concept is universal. Thankfully, the remake in 2009 of The Last House on the Left sticks with this concept, but makes a few changes along the way. Of course, being a remake, not all of them are too good.After a run-in with a deadly gang lead by Krug (Garret Dillahunt), 17-year-old Mari (Sara Paxton) is left for dead in the remote woods during a horrific storm. Since the gang has no way to escape the woods for the night, they stumble upon a couple, Emma (Monica Potter) and John (Tony Goldwyn) living in a cottage on the lake. The couple is hospitable, tend to some of the gang's wounds, and set them up in the guest house nearby. The gang only finds out later that Emma and John happen to be Mari's parents.It is not that there is anything specifically horrible about The Last House on the Left; it is just the fact that it seems so monotonously made. Even for those who have no knowledge of the original film, the remake still plays like a paint-by-numbers of modern horror. There are practically no scares and everything plays out in a predictable fashion. As fantastic as the trailer for the film was, it sets up every death scene (taking away what little semblance of originality and uniqueness they have) and almost every beat the film takes. It may say there are twists and turns, but the major twist is in the setup. It feels stale right after its unconventional opening, and it never tries to freshen itself up at any point. It just plays right into everything you ever imagine happening.The remake attempts to make each character a bit more developed than they were in the original film, but it falls into the same trap as the original. The characters seem to just run on instinct, and their actions and motivations do not always gel with who their character is supposed to be. The film's central rape scene comes off more as a forced plot device than it does a realistic thing to happen with these characters. We understand the parents want to take out their revenge on this gang, but they are setup to be a smart couple with inherent morals (John is a prominent surgeon at a big city hospital). It is easy to just complain about characters traits transforming on a whim, but the fact they are setup so differently than the original films' characters make their actions seem silly and baffling.The film's multiple death scenes are a bit of a mixed bag. While some are horrifically violent in context, it seems the filmmakers want to just keep one-upping themselves. They never seem satisfied with how they do away with their characters, and spend the entirety of the film trying to make the deaths more ridiculous than they should be. While the majority are mindnumblingly graphic, they never come off as pushing the envelope for the genre. Anyone who has seen a Saw film has likely seen much worse material than what is on display here. And considering how uncompromisingly violent the film wants to be in frequently lingering on the moments before people are killed off or as they lay dying, some of the deaths just do not fit with the ideals the film wants to have. They jump back and forth like the characters' motivations, and never seem to rest in wanting to keep up with one idea or move into another.Where the film does succeed, much like the original, is in its ability to make the viewer feel increasingly uncomfortable. The aforementioned rape scene is nowhere near as disgusting as the one featured in Craven's original film, but it still manages to successfully border on being exploitative. It is unhinged, and goes on for just long enough to either make the viewer want to look away in disgust or keep watching just to see how far the filmmakers will go. Even the characters seem to be sitting in just as much shock as the viewer is. While its addition borders on lunacy, it is shot in a way that comes off as raw as a modern film can make it look. It is no Irreversible, and does not even come close to I Spit on Your Grave, but the camera's habit of lingering on the destruction taking place makes it feel just as sick as it needs to. While some of the death scenes also have this effect, none of them are anywhere near as powerfully conveyed as the rape scene.The acting is about as great as it can be from a film that baits-and-switches its character developments and dimensionality. Goldwyn and Potter do some decent work as the scorn parents, but they never really get the chance to really stretch their characters out from being happy, worried parents to a couple on the warpath. I wanted to like Aaron Paul's Francis, but he seems to be far too downplayed throughout the film, only appearing when he needs to add a layer of creepiness to the film. Dillahunt does the best work of anyone, jumping maniacally between being the disgusting and borderline insane leader of the gang, and trying to convince Mari's parents he's a great guy. It is a great role for him, but I cannot help but wish his talent was shown in a much better film.Overall, The Last House on the Left is watchable, but just not as great as it could have been. Too much flipflopping by the filmmakers make the film lose its edge far too early.5/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",The Last House on the Left

When the parents discover who their unexpected guests are, there's hell to pay, just as in the original.For the squeamish among you, there is a rape scene and several grisly killings. They are no worse than what you have seen in HOSTEL or HIGH TENSION, but if those films aren't your cup of tea, stay away from this. Thje movie is very slick and professionally crafted, and feels pretty real, if not quite as in-your-face as Craven's documentary-type original. It also boasts some outstanding stunt work, a la TAKEN. No big-name actors (Tony Goldwyn is the biggest name, and most folks don't know him except for ""Ghost""), but the film doesn't need them. When you think the film is over, sit tight.

However after the dirty business they get shelter at the home of Mari's mom and dad (Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn) but soon a gruesome fate awaits for the killers.A well done and surprisingly terrific remake of a sleazy 1972 Wes Craven shocker which in turn was based on Igmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Springs"" is a nifty sleaze-feast. The acting is very improved over the original yet still remains the original's use of shocks, rape, gory violence and human drama that made the 1972 version such a cult favorite. There is some brutally violent sequences especially the gruesome unexpected ending you won't forget, of course Wes Craven with friend Sean S. Cunningham who collaborated on the original did a good job serving as executive producers and even director Dennis Iladis did some great directing. Much like the 1972 film, this movie isn't for the weak minded or faint hearted for it manages to honor the original with it's brutality and appalling rape sequence.A must see and one of the better remakes in recent memory along with ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Hills Have Eyes"", ""The Ring"", and ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"".",The Last House on the Left
79,LazySod,Run of the mill,4,22 June 2009,"A family (father, mother, daughter) go out for a vacation at their house at the lake.

When the daughter goes out for a night out in town she meets up with an old friend and from there the events start rolling.Standard horror films always have a standard family living somewhere and their adversary in the form of one or more evil minded people that will find them and kill, hurt, maim them (in no particular order). This film isn't any different from that - after the first initial explanations of the characters the action starts rolling and although most of it isn't that bad at all it is all too much of a run of the mill. Too standard. Too weak to impress. Add to that a final 30 seconds that are completely misfitting the rest of the film and the ending score is clear: 4 out of 10 people living near a lake",The Last House on the Left

The tormentors then unwittingly spend the night at the home of the parents and needless to say, it will be one long night...As a fan of the 70's horror genre, I was appalled to learn that Wes Craven's landmark horror-thriller was going to be remade for modern audiences. I wondered just how they would tone-down such a violent and disturbing classic for today's audiences without just ruining the entire film. Much to my surprise though this polished-looking remake actually retained much of the violent brutality of the original film.I'll warn you up front folks, this isn't a film for all tastes, even the average horror fan may have a difficult time watching this one. Like the original film there's an effectively disturbing rape scene and some very bloody violence. While Last House 2009 does alter the story of the original somewhat, it stays fairly true to the shocking nature and gripping suspense that made the original a classic. It has some terrific action sequences and remains quite intense throughout. The cast delivers good performances, the cinematography is slickly done, and the guys at KNB create some excellent makeup work as usual.My only complaint about the remake is the fact that it shy's away from the bleak ending of the original in favor of a more routine Hollywood ending. Still overall it remains a bold and effective effort. All in all Last House 2009 is above-average by remake standards. It's solidly-made and remains engaging and tense all the way.

81,danielmanson,It's not too bad of a film,6,16 May 2020,"I'll jump in straight away and say that I am aware that this is a remake, but I have not seen it. So I am judging this based of it being a standalone film not attached to anything else.What I didn't like: the characters, mainly the villains, had absolutely no real depth to them. Why were they so bad? Kind of just said here's the bad people, now let's get into it.
Rape scene I felt was a bit unneeded. I got a lot of ""I spit on your grave"" vibes watching it. There's several ways you can depict rape and I felt this was just a bit too far.Positives: I enjoyed the plot in general though, it kept me engaged throughout and really had me rooting for certain characters. I thought it was acted well, I knew this because I absolutely hated the villains in this and when I gain such a hatred like that it usually means they are doing the part well.
But yeah I thought it's a good watch overall, it's definitely a slasher film and nothing more, so if you are watching with the intention of it being a typical horror then don't.",The Last House on the Left

83,Ali_John_Catterall,Knock Knock,3,1 June 2009,"This one comes with more baggage than the carousel at Heathrow Terminal Five. Last House On The Left is a remake of a remake of Ingmar Bergman's 1959 Oscar-winner 'The Virgin Spring', itself an adaptation of 'Töres Dotter I Wänge', a medieval Swedish folk ballad of child murder and parental retribution. It possibly goes without saying that the Bergman film is about as funny as a burning Punch & Judy booth. Wes Craven's unofficial 'remake' of The Virgin Spring is even less amusing than that. And this 2009 version makes you want to throw in your lot with a doomsday cult.In Last House '2.0', Mari Collingwood (Sara Paxton) and her girlfriend Paige (Martha MacIsaac) are looking, in time-honoured fashion, to score some reefer when they stumble on a delightful bunch of escaped sex killers led by Krug (Garret Dillahunt), who tortures and murders Paige, and rapes and leaves Mari for dead in the woods. Later, during a storm, Krug and company seek first aid and shelter at the nearest house which, by an amazing coincidence, just happens to be Mari's eponymous home. Her surgeon parents patch them up and put them up - until they learn the truth. Hippocratic oaths may yet be broken...Plot-wise, this reboot isn't too dissimilar from its predecessors (discounting a tawdry 2005 knock-off called 'Chaos'). But tonally, it's as distinct from its immediate forebear as that film is from The Virgin Spring. Bergman's bleakly powerful work highlights the tensions between deep-rooted paganism and the younger Christian religion, as Max Von Sydow's devout Catholic demonstrably fails to turn the other cheek after discovering that the huntsmen he's sheltering have previously raped and murdered his virginal churchgoing daughter. Jettisoning all theology, Craven's spin on it simply offers the blunt message that violence degrades everybody and that a switchblade in the kidneys begets a chainsaw in the face.Craven's notorious debut is among a select bunch of movies, such as 1974's 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre', that critics and cult movie aficionados revere like the Dead Sea Scrolls of horror. Some have called it ""rough around the edges"", which is putting it politely. It's terrible. From its tension-diluting cutaways to its comedy cops and hillbilly score, it's one of the most perverse, cack-handed horrors ever made, even for a zero-budget exploitation flick. Craven has described how outraged audiences tried to bust into the projection room to attack the negative with scissors. Possibly, they were merely trying to edit it properly.So, while Last House 2009 is not a great film, or even a good film, if movies were judged purely on technical merit, this would bat its ancestor right out of the ballpark. And yet Version 1, where grindhouse meets art-house, remains infinitely more interesting. In depicting realistic Manson-style murder, rape, torture and intestine-removal, former university professor Craven and producer Sean S Cunningham (creator of 'Friday The 13th', another significant addition to the slasher subgenre) ""set out to show violence the way we thought it really was"", to take ""all the B-movie conventions and stand them on their head"" as Craven put it. The result was a hugely influential, censor-baiting wake-up call to a nation numbed and desensitized by the Vietnam War.Yet if Wes Craven's freakish, warts-and-all experiment is a product of the counter-culture, this year's model, lacking any meaningful context of its own, is the exact opposite: reactionary, conservative - existing purely as a slicker, and thus in some respects sicker, commercial venture, more grisly grist to the multiplex mill. If Craven's original wielded a rusty dagger, this version comes at you with a laser beam. And with its overly familiar scenes of limbs in the waste disposal unit, topless Hell-queens, and WWE-style smackdowns between heroes and villains, this cannot hope to have the same impact on today's audiences, as desensitized in their own way from a legacy of instantly accessed horror, fictional and real.Perhaps the most telling statement is to be found in the film's own press release: ""There was never any question as to whether 'The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe' designers would create the special effects makeup for The Last House On The Left...""",The Last House on the Left

The part of this film I caught was where a woman is being brutally stabbed to death, all for the enjoyment and titillation of the viewer. I turned off in disgust.I love good old fashioned horror films, but these modern ones aren't even real horror, they're just life events on film for the enjoyment of sickos worldwide.I see from IMDb that a heck of a lot of people think this is a good film, which scares me.

87,LloydBayer,When re-makes are better than the original,7,9 April 2012,"Originally written and directed by Wes Craven in 1972, this version by the same name is a film that achieves a rare distinction these days in that the re-make is better than its predecessor. Also produced by Craven, this 2009 version may not be as shocking as his original, provided you have seen the original. If you haven't, let this be a warning more than a spoiler that violence is brutal, including a very disturbing rape sequence. You may also be forgiven for thinking this is a horror film, but don't let the trailers fool you. This is not a slasher desperately trying to make a fast buck by bringing back psychotic killers like Jason and Michael. At the core, this is an exploitation film, the likes of which have been long abandoned and banned from making, solely due to the graphic and realistic nature of scenes, coupled with the stringent censorship boards we have today. ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (1978), is one such similar film that will be hard to reach a restricted viewing audience today, even if film makers decide to tone down the level of brutality. Even so, after all the censoring, editing and masked scenes of violence, this film will still be hard to watch at times. The plot is also tweaked up in this latest release fine tuning Craven's earlier film from its main flaws, ultimately making this a formidable thriller in this day and age. A trio of ruthless criminals, two care-free teenage girls, over concerned yet quick thinking parents, and the stage is set for a nail biting, nerve racking experience that hasn't been around since Martin Scorsese's ""Cape Fear"". When Mari and Page befriend Justin, they have no idea of the intense ordeal coming their way. Before they can finish smoking a shared joint, Justin's recently escaped convict father and his two accomplices kidnap the girls and hold them hostage taking no chances in letting the girls report his whereabouts to the authorities. With Mari's presence of mind and feigned cooperation, she convincingly allows the antagonist to steer her hijacked SUV towards her parent's lake house. But a botched attempt at escape causes the vehicle to crash, subsequently causing both girls to face the sadistic wrath of their captors, Krug, Sadie and Francis. Stranded in a patch of isolated woods, Mari and Page have only each other for support. While one lies gagged, bound and viciously stabbed, her pain is nothing compared when helplessly watching her friend brutally violated, just yards away. Not too far, Emma and John Collingwood prepare for the thunderstorm ahead, one they know is coming. What they don't know, is the fate of their daughter and the terror approaching their old lake house. What works for director Dennis Iliadis is a well written script that upgrades the original plot to an above average thriller by current standards. Except for the very last scene, the entire plot carries itself well with ample elements of suspense and action with gut wrenching emotions of fear and hatred from all actors. Acting is also stellar and water tight, starting with Sara Paxton as Mari and Martha Maclsaac as Page, two friends out to have some harmless fun but ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Garret Dillahunt as Krug is superb as the antagonist invoking utter loathing for a character every viewer loves to hate. This is a villain with substance, not just some machete wielding lunatic. Monica Potter also delivers a well done role as Mari's mother with fantastic emotion and insight when Krug and his gang arrive at her house. Equaling her performance is Tony Goldwyn as her husband and Mari's father. For a change, it's good to see him in a positive role, especially after his sleazy Colonel Bagley in ""The Last Samurai"". Other areas where Iliadis excels are in cinematography and music. Expect some good visuals with well framed angles during faced paced action as well as some good underwater shots. The score is fresh and complements these scenes with mounting suspense and reaches a crescendo just when you reach the edge of your seat.At the end of it all, the sad reality is that you really can't say ""this is only a movie"", because people like Krug exists and is all around. Faced with a life and death situation as depicted here, would you defend every second of your life or wait tentatively for the police to arrive? Revenge in any form is against modern law. Survival isn't. And that is what this film clearly says.",The Last House on the Left
88,sunznc,"Intense, unnerving and potent.",9,18 October 2009,"This remake is potent and unnerving. The original film was gritty, dreary and disturbing but low budget and had some silly scenes and dialogue. Also, because the original didn't use well known actors it had a realistic feel to it. This remake uses actors we've seen before. However, I was not familiar with the actors playing the young girls. This film drags you into the story along with the girls as they look to score some good pot. Despite the fact that one girl is a regular user there is a wholesome innocence to both girls that you don't want to see spoiled. We feel the dread as the girls are introduced to their soon to be attackers and it makes us uneasy. We feel queasy when the attack begins and want it to be over. Things get a little bit unrealistic for a time but then we focus on the parents and the dialogue between them and again, we are being whipped into intense frenzy. Quiet frenzy. The parents make their move like a panther moving into the kill. Some of it isn't going to work for everyone but for horror fans this is a good fix.

90,gary-444,A Powerful Gore Fest,8,16 June 2009,"The horror genre lives in a bubble of its own, and so needs to be judged as such, and this ticks the genre boxes pretty well. Convincingly acted, and well plotted, Director Dennis Lliadis delivers a pacey, beautifully photographed film that understands its audience, even teasing it a little.It skilfully borrows form Road Movie, Revenge and Horror and Gore raw materials to produce a satisfying end result.The first half unfolds in Road Movie mode, the bad guys appear, literally quite spectacularly, then our heroic heroine is introduced to meet her inevitable nemesis.Lascivious, lingering shots of her legs and torso leave little doubt that bad things are going to happen to her.This part,Mari, well played by Sara Paxton,is notable for eschewing girly screams for grim determination , and is all the better for it.When Mari and her friend Paige foolishly choose to smoke some dope at a run down motel, the result is kidnap rape and torture.The controversial rape sequence is much less graphic than is trailed ( what a surprise). I found the fate of her friend,Paige, far more disturbing.The second half is Revenge, and Horror and Gore, time when the assailants inadvertently hole up at Mari's parents house ! When they discover whom they are entertaining the blood letting starts.The morality of what you could, or should, do in such circumstances is touched upon, but not for very long, it is time for cold steel to meet deserving flesh.It is the revenge element which gives the second half its impetus as the audience celebrates the worthy demise of each bad guy.The presence of a woman in the fugitive gang is a neat device.Once our original victims have flashed their bosoms it gives an opportunity for her to do so too. Indeed the only woman not to have her breasts on display is Mari's mother - which would have been a horror too far for any self respecting teenage horror fan surely? The ending is a tease. Surely one of the bad guys will chance upon the boathouse? Who could possibly spring out of the water in the final boat scene? Instead, the final ""surprise"" is short, gratuitous, and wasted. The strength of this story is to combine the revenge themes explored in the likes of ""Death Wish"" and ""The Brave One"" with a conventional gore fest, which at least offers some purpose to the bloodbath,showing author Wes Craven at his best.",The Last House on the Left
91,PoisonKeyblade,One of the all-time greatest remakes,10,16 March 2009,"Normally, I'm a huge fan of remakes. I just enjoy seeing a different director/actor/screenwriter's take on the original movie that may or may not have been especially great. Last House on the Left has the good fortune of a little-known cast and a virtually unknown director, which makes the overall quality of the movie all the more impressive.Mari Collingwood and her parents drive to their summer cabin in the woods for a nice, relaxing vacation. When Mari goes to spend the night with her good friend, Paige, all sorts of problems arise that question the fabric of human nature, good versus evil, and how far you'd go for the one you love.The rape scene that the original is so well known for is just as brutal here, if not moreso. It's done in an incredibly effective and saddening way, one which I won't describe here. There are some really good questions raised in this movie, one of the biggest asked right in the tagline - ""If bad people hurt someone you love, how far would you go to hurt them back?"" It's a very interesting question that's just as relevant now as it was more than thirty years ago.Like mentioned before, the cast of this remake is one of the aspects that elevates it above the original. The acting is just absolute perfection by all of those involved. Sara Paxton was really the shining star of the movie, going places as an actress that I never thought she'd be able to. She shows a lot of range, and is especially great in some of the more challenging scenes. Her phenomenal acting greatly contributes to something that makes the movie work so well. It really gets under your skin, and that's because you can relate to these women. You can relate to the parents. It's all done so realistically, and that's largely in part to the fantastic performances. Martha MacIsaac, who was great in 2007's Superbad, shows a completely different side in this movie as Paige, who really wants to escape the increasingly terrifying situations.The parents were amazing as well. Monica Potter comes off beautifully as the average mother, one who not-so-willingly resorts to violence. She really loves her daughter, and it comes into major play later in the movie. Her best scene is when she and her husband John discover Mari on the porch, and bring her inside. When he tells her that the daughter has been raped, you just feel the emotion poring out of her. Tony Goldwyn, who I only remember from Ghost, definitely comes off strong as a father who acts on rage. He's furious that people who do something like this to someone he loves so much. His ferocity later in the movie is slickly-acted and it makes the final act all the more effective.Obviously in any movie like this, the antagonists are an extremely important part of making the movie both believable and relateable. One of the most effective scenes in the original is kept intact here. After the rape scene, no one, not even Krug (the main baddie) himself can believe how far they just took things. It all elevates so quickly. It's nice that they made the villains so believable and so vile and terrible. Krug is played very well by Garrett Dilahunt, who carries a lot of the movie on his shoulders. Riki Lindhome, who had big shoes to fill considering how iconic the Sadie in the original film was, does a spectacular job here even though she has a little less to do overall. All of her lines hit the mark, and she's always believable. She never quite gets as crazy as the original Sadie, but in doing so, she almost creates another character all together. Spencer Treat Clark was perfect, and I enjoyed him all the more after seeing him in The Babysitters. He brought a subtle quietness to the character of Justin, and made you feel something for a character that could have gone either way in the hands of a lesser actor. Last but certainly not least was Aaron Paul as Francis, an actor I recognized from Big Love. His performance was pretty damn perfect, especially later in the film when he had more difficult scenes. He just did an incredible job, and delivered some of his lines with the skills of a seasoned pro like Johnny Depp. He has a quiet creepiness about him that worked well for the movie and especially for his character.Like any good horror film, the director either makes or breaks the effectiveness of it all. Dennis Iliadis is one of the genre's most skilled filmmakers after only one film, and here's to hoping he's here to stay. The intensity of chase scenes is coupled with incredible cinematography and shots. He makes swimming look absolutely gorgeous. This movie is just the perfect example of how an incredible director can have such a profound effect on a film. Iliadis is just absolutely fantastic, and he makes this movie his own.Overall, it's just fantastic to see all of the support Wes Craven has given to this film, and it was all well-deserved. This will most definitely be one of the best movies of '09. Fantastic cast, good metaphors, a meaningful ending, outrageous kills, an emotionally draining journey into the depravity of humanity, and an awesomely great director make Last House on the Left an astounding piece of genre film-making that ought to be remembered for years to come. Its in-your-face brutality, shockingly tender chase scenes, and edge-of-your-seat thrills make one unbelievably perfect movie.",The Last House on the Left
92,MovieGuy01,"Brutal & sick, one of the best remakes ever....",8,24 October 2009,"I thought that The Last House On The Left was one of the best horror movies that i have seen in the last few years Emma (Monica Potter), John (Tony Goldwyn), and Mari Collingwood (Sara Paxton) head out on holiday to their lake house. not long after arriving, Mari borrows the family car and drives into town to spend time with her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac). Paige works at a local store, she and Mari meet Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), a teenager who is passing through town who invites them both back to his hotel room to smoke some weed. While the three of them are in the hotel room, Krug (Garret Dillahunt),Justins father, Francis (Aaron Paul), Justins uncle, and Sadie (Riki Lindhome), Krug's girlfriend, arrive. Krug shows Justin a newspaper that has Krug's and Sadie's pictures on the front page which shows that Krug got out of police custody he believes that it is too risky to let Paige and Mari go, so Krug kidnaps them and escapes in their vehicle to try and leave town.Mari tells him to take a road that leads him to her parents house. Mari trys to jump out of the car which causes Krug to crash into a tree. Mari trys to escape from the wreckage. So Sadie and Francis beat Mari as she crawls away from the wreckage. Krug decides to rape Mari. Paige begins shouting at him to make him stop which causes Krug to stab Paige in the stomach twice. Mari has enough strength to escape them and get to the lake so that she can get to safety. Before she can swim far enough Krug shoots her in the back, leaving her to bleed in the lake. A bad storm forces Krug and his gang to stay with John and Emma, Mari's mother and father whose home is nearby. Justin then realises that they are Mari's parents, and leaves a necklace Mari was wearing on the counter. John and Emma find Mari, hardly alive, on their porch, they realise that the people who did this to Mari are in their home. they decide to get revenge on those responsible.

It is also a remake of the 1972 film by Wes Craven, which in turn is a remake of the art film, Virgin Spring (1960) by Ingmar Bergman.Two cute girls, teenagers are hanging out, find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time when they go to the apartment of a boy named Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) to smoke some pot and chill out, when his family comes back who are wanted in the connection with some local murders. Now they can't let the girls go. From there things get steadily worse until the girls are left brutalized.The convicts having driven out to the middle of nowhere find their way to a small cabin to recuperate, until the happy couple waiting for their daughter to bring the car home realize these are the men who hurt their daughter, and they aren't going to take it lying down.In the feel of Hostel, extreme violence in retribution ensues, and that's pretty much the entire flick. You might recognize Garret Dillahunt who plays the lead baddie, Krug from the prime time series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Michael Bowen (""Lost"", Magnolia, Jackie Brown), Joshua Cox (""Strong Medicine""), Sara Paxton as the daughter (Summerland), and Riki Lindhome as the friend (My Best Friend's Girl).The pacing is strong, and somehow the film works a lot better than say a movie like Hostel for reason of solid directing, acting, and simple but effective script.",The Last House on the Left
94,tburke85,The Last House On The Left A Decent Horror Remake,6,31 August 2009,"The Last House On The Left is a decent horror remake among many others being re-imagined these days like Friday The 13th, The Hills Have Eyes, and Halloween. Director Dennis Illiadis is admirable in giving audiences what they come to except from this kind of genre. The cast for the most part are good in their roles. Tony Goldwyn's convincing as John Collingwood and so is Monica Potter as his wife Emma. They're both believable as their characters caught in this deadly cat and mouse game with their daughters attackers even when things can over the top at times violence wise. Sara Paxton is equally impressive as their daughter Mari who is raped and left for dead. She shows some real talent as an actress in her limited screen time. Garret Dillahunt is effective as Krug a psychopathic prison escapee and the same can go to Aaron Paul as his brother Francis and Riki Lindome as his twisted lover Sadie. Spencer Treat Clark also turns in a good performance as Krugs son Justin whose conscience begins to weigh down on him. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles too. The violence committed by the gang and family are well executed. The suspense does build up once the family learns who Krug and his family are which doesn't quite pay off but it's an admirable attempt none the less. Some of the deaths do go over the top but this is a horror movie so I'm willing to suspend my disbelief. Despite some flaws with character development, more suspense, and a little originality with the deaths this remake was better than I thought it would be. The rape scene was appalling and it felt unnecessary. The movie could've done without showing so much of it but hey thats me. Overall though The Last House On The Left is one of the rare remakes out there that turns out to be a decent suspense horror thriller thats sure to please almost any die hard fan of the genre.",The Last House on the Left
95,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"In this writer's opinion, the best horror remake by far.",9,13 March 2009,"As we all know, the horror remake has become a genre in its own way. With each remake, we constantly complain that Hollywood is running out of ideas and is turning to the cheap thrills of half assed remakes to get their buck as quickly as they can. Virtually every major horror film of the 1970's and 1980's has already been remade, or is on its way (hello, Hellraiser and A Nightmare On Elm Street!). While there have been some terrible abominations to their originals, the 2009 version of Wes Craven's ""The Last House On the Left"" is not even close to those, surpassing the others to become the best horror remake to date. While some may say, ""that's like being the best video game movie!"", I assure you, this is a thriller that thrills, scares, and knows how to get the audience involved with the film.As is a movie that isn't all that deep itself, and has a basic premise with no major plot twist, I'll keep this review short. I'm not going to be an idiot and say that this is a movie that has deep, thought provoking characters with oodles of development - it's not that kind of film. Dennis Iliadis knows what he has to work with and uses it to his advantage, shooting a riveting thriller that, while showcasing enough blood to drown a small village, is never overdone. ""The Last House On the Left"" doesn't delve into the easy escape route of the torture porn/unnecessary sex romp that other remakes have (I'm looking at you, Friday the 13th). It's gruesome and bloody when it needs to be, and this is why the audience can enjoy it.Another detail I really liked about this one was the extreme attention paid to the suspense. At around 2 hours, this one runs pretty long for a horror film, and most of it is the build up to the climactic showdown in the house of which the title speaks. However, there's enough thrills and suspense in this to keep us interested, even though the actual house doesn't play a role until the second half of the movie. I also liked the script from Carl Ellsworth, who again manages to create an entertaining atmosphere, much like he did in Red Eye and Disturbia. Is the guy going to win any Oscars? No, as most of the dialog in his movies is pretty below average, but the guy knows how to write entertaining movies.I guess the acting here is acceptable, especially for a horror film (oh how I long for a great actor to be in a horror film again...where did the Sigourney Weaver's of the world go?), but it's nothing to write home about. Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn are acceptable as parents acting instinctively to protect their daughter, while Sara Paxton is impressive in a role that will not remind anyone that this is the same girl that did ""Aquamarine"". As for the villains, again, they are passable, but I really think Josh Brolin would've owned Garrett Dillahunt's role, while Aaron Paul's part would've been perfect for a guy like Ben Foster. What's that? Yes I'm aware that those two would probably never sign on to a movie like this, I'm just having a bit of wishful thinking. Dillahunt's character was well written enough to the point where he didn't need to add anything to make him menacing, but there was a lot of potential there.All in all, this is one of the better horror films of recent memory (better than pretty much any mainstream 2008 horror film, that's for sure), and in my opinion the best remake of them all. It's not cheap, it's well made, and it's got what looks like a lot of effort in it. I really enjoyed it for what it was, and came out pleasantly surprised.",The Last House on the Left
96,Jerique,Better than Rob Zombie's attempt...,5,10 March 2011,"How do you remake a Wes Craven horror film? Well, here's kind of how.First things first; the acting. I'm surprised they didn't try to get a bigger name to sell this movie better. Perhaps the lack of star power is what has taken me so long to see this film. Anyways, I found this band of players kind of subpar, to say the least, in their roles. I think it was nice to allow for Tony Goldwyn to be the lead protagonist.Plot-wise, this movie is incredibly predictable. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But when you have zero suspense and zero mystery after the first 15 minutes, it's hard to keep the audience on their toes (or in their seats). I predicted this movie from 15 minutes in correctly.A huge flaw I found in the film was the kidnappers ability to be nefarious and torture their victims...or lack of. These guys are the worst bunch of evil people...I mean, they almost let these girls get the better of them on several occasions. They are easily outsmarted multiple times.One thing, however, I did like a lot in the film was the expected clichés of jump scenes and the scenes where the protagonist slowly maneuvers through the scene only to get killed or injured at the last second.I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It's at least way better than Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. It's not the worst remake and it's definitely not the worst horror film I've seen. I've seen a lot better, but I've seen way worse.",The Last House on the Left
97,KoolCatReviews,Go straight on to avoid the drama,5,21 May 2020,"There's not too much I can say about this movie it has a simplistic plot that is pretty fundamental. It some brutal scenes that had me question the nature of the movie. It goes big on shock valve, it's purpose is purely to gross out the audience. It tries it hand at tension too but that is a let down. The ending feels little out of place to me and quite clearly shows us that it is designed to shock.

98,krycek19,"The ending, and a few plot-holes bad acting from the gang-leader ruins the movie",7,16 October 2010,"I liked this movie up until the ending, because it is very creepy and disturbing and very brutal and at the same time realistic.But there were certain things that did'nt work for me.First of all the gang-leader Krug (Garret Dillahunt) didn't convince me. His acting was wooden at best. Aaron Paul as Francis was the creepiest in the gang and he should have been playing the leader. And been the one that raped the daughter Mari.Second: the parents were far too brutal and sadistic in the way they killed the gang-members one by one. The gang did rape, shoot and almost killed their daughter, But they haven't done anything to the parents. Had the gang members attacked the parents first, the parents extreme violence towards them, would have been more justified. They way they killed Francis was too horrible. And the scene way too long.I really hated the disgusting ending where Krugs head explodes inside a microwave. It seems to have been added later on, because, what appeared to be Krugs death scene, was'nt brutal enough. Had the movie ended with the parents, the daughter and Krugs son sailing down the lake in the motor-boat, it would have been an okay movie and a good ending.The best performance were by far Spencer Treat Clark as Justin, Kruks son. The way he acted his ass off, having almost no lines throughout the entire movie.Mari (Sara Paxton) didn't have much to do in the movie, besides being beat up, raped and shot. It would have been nice to see her get some payback. And certainly more justifiable and satisfying than her parents doing all the sadistic killings.But definitely a good horror-flick, although a lot less gore would have been easier to stomach.But it will be remembered for a long time by me as extremely creepy and because of that it worked very well.",The Last House on the Left
99,tequila101,Better film of the Two,7,15 June 2012,"Before people get picky again with reviews, I would like to speak out about why the 2009 remake is a whole lot better than the original. First off, it's modern day setting suits the situation, we have better actors, more tension, excellent action sequences, odd deaths, good acting and an eerie soundtrack score.To me, many of these things was what the original film was missing, back in 1972. Wes Craven no doubt it a smart and very cunning director who has done some excellent horror films, where he tapped into those who were afraid of going into the hills, going to sleep or even getting a phone call from an unknown stalker. Last House on the Left that he did however, although shocking, gruesome, full on and graphic was never really enough for me to cut it. I always found myself a tad bored with the film but I will admit that the shockingness of the rape, torture and mutilation did go under my skin. The first time watching it, I had to stop the film after the girl had peed-ed her pants. It was truly a shocking grimace to be seen. Although I have mixed feelings about it, I thought the remake actually did a better job to capture some of the original's brutality.The actors were much better this time round. Especially the guy who played Krug this time round. He was very believable as well as the kid who played Justin. The music was tense and ground breaking, giving us an indication that something gruesome or brutal was about to come our way.The violence was also very intense and many of the deaths kept me in tune with the film.Many of these good elements are here, and they are much better than what the original had produced. There was one problem. It was the same issue I had, had with the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003). The film's premise although gritty was not nearly as impacting like the original's. I had the same problem with Last House on the Left (2009).In the original, I liked the shocking, camera movements which were gritty as heck. In the remake, there is no purpose or existence of it since it was 2009. It truly takes the magic away from what it wants to do. Which was shock. The death scenes although excellent, weren't as shocking as the original's. Oh well, a lot of remakes or I should say nearly ALL of them don't/or haven't had the capacity to shock viewers.Overall, this 2009 version is a whole lot better, and is an improvement over the original, but as far as being a Horror fan goes, I've never been a fan of the ""Last House"" films.It receives a 7.5/10",The Last House on the Left
100,zfiany,A very rewarding movie!,8,13 October 2009,"It's the kind of movies that fills you with all the tension required, anger, disgust, and all the feelings that you usually let go of yourself for a horror movie to please it. And after all this amalgamation of feelings, comes the only logical ending that would satisfy the thirsty ""you"" for such.I guess the user Jenkins said it all about this movie and gave it the best description when it comes to everything. I have to mention though that all the actors in this movie have done great and they presented the most sincere acting ever , each one of them. The good guys and the bad guys as well. They all showed the kind of honesty in delivering their roles that you will enjoy a movie which has so many common things with other movies and yet still can stand alone unique in unknown way thanks to the performers indeed! One final thing, I have noticed that when the bad guys are more than one, the ending is that they all die and the nice people win while when the villain is one individual, he kills them all! It's only logical because when the baddies come in group, they should die one after the other! I like it better this way.One rewarding experience is this movie!",The Last House on the Left
101,RickHarvey,"Look on the bright side, it can't get any worse than the original",5,29 June 2010,"For the past through years, we have been bombarded by countless remakes all so that Hollywood can gain easy cash. With most remakes being rather poor in terms of contrast with the original, it is safe to say that Last house on the left reboot could be any worse that the original.The opening is rather silly, the whole escape scene is OTT. As soon as it happens , you realise that this is going to be one of yours typical modern thriller, crime films where characters are wooden but the gore is heavy. The first half of the film is rather boring. They have kept the dark nature of two girls being taken to the woods. Due to the fact i knew what was coming, i kind of found the characters boring. the perpetrators were dull, all sound the same and didn't really make the hairs on the back of my neck stand. The girl who played Paige was annoying, i just disliked here very much.It not until they reach the parents house that things start getting good. what helped the second half of the film was that both parents could act pretty well. Things become much tense despite the fact that some parts are abit cliché. what do you get in the second half? Well good acting for one and darker atmosphere. Most of the deaths were heavy on the gore but it what you expect.Overall, Last house on the left is an OK reboot. The first half was extremely boring but the second half saves the film. As it is, it takes it place in the lower section of modern remakes. But it fair to say that it has defiantly improved from the original",The Last House on the Left
102,iamtherobotman,The last braincell...,4,16 May 2020,"What starts off as a potentially good thriller quickly desends into an absolute mess.
Spoilers ahead.Once the 'bad guys' arrive at the house, this film just falls apart. Particularly once it's discovered who these people actually are. The wife stabs one of the culprits in the HEART with a kitchen knife and he still comes at her after pulling the knife out his chest. The husband then comes at the bloke with a hammer but loses it all too easily. Remember this guy has just been stabbed in the heart!!!! Something which would kill a mere mortal, but not this lad. He's then got his head shoved in a sink of soapy water, still manages to fight against it and pulls the plug out while doing it. He then has his hand mangled in the garbage disposal unit and is still going until the husband slams the claw hammer into his skull.Our next killing is just as needlessless complex and time consuming as the young lad who comes with our killers hands the husband a gun while main bad guy and his woman sleep on blissfully unaware, until that is, she wakens up...husband dear husband shoots her in the throat, not killing her i may add, while main bad guy leapos out of bed and skillfully avoids being shot by throwing a pile of clothes at mr husband, who recoild as though he's been hit be a juggernaut into a chest of drawers to then be attacked by main bad guys women, who is remarkably strong for such a slightly built wee thing with blood pouring from her throat. Of course a melee ensues where mad guys woman struggles with husband dear husband and eventually bad guys son...She of course manages to fight both of them off unbelievably well considering her condition and looks to be winning in fact until wife spoils the party and shoots her in the eye.More madness ensues and husband dear husband sets off in search of main bad guy. Now remember, this is HIS house!!! He should know the lay out better than main bad guy who has only been in there 10 minutes and has the added disadvantage of it being dark, manages to evade husband for quite some time, luring him with perhaps the most obvious lure in the history of luring. Still husband falls for it and gets quite the doing from main bad guy who kicks husband all over the house, through wooden banisters, book cases, you name it... Of ocurse, eventually bad guy has a chance to kill husband but does what all bad, bad guys do and pontificates far too long, allowing son to come in with gun held to main bad guys head...YOu can tell what's coming next. Can't you? That's right. No bullets. son get stabbed with poker until wife comes in and blasts bad guy with a CO2 fire extinguisher, husband gets up and slaps bad guy with poker, mum slams fire extinguisher into bad guys gut, bad guy goes down unconcious...Next scene, husband has bad gu on kitchen table...bad guy comes round and points out that he can't feel his legs...of course he's been paralysed from the neck down. Now arguably the best part. Husband wheels in a microwave oven and lifts bad guys head into it. Door open he sets the timer and walks away...Bad guys head exposed to radiation explodes...Now, how is this possible? Microwave ovens are designed to work only when the door is closed.I remember watching this film a few years back and i seemed to enjoy it so i watched it again only to be stunned at how bad it was. So many cliche's so many over used tropes. Laughable in actual fact.
This is a poor film!! You have been warned. I gave it a 4 stars for the start of the film which was decent.",The Last House on the Left
103,Simon_Says_Movies,Mostly excellent but resorts to shock values and sadism,6,1 June 2009,"Only a few films can lay claim to having been remade a total of 4 times (well, three remakes and the original). The birth-giver so to speak was The Virgin Spring directed by the one and only Igmar Bergman. that was followed up by Wes Cravens 'original' The Last House on the Left and then by Chaos in 2005. But unfortunately for Dennis Iliadis' version, this flick can also make a unique claim of ruining itself based on exactly two scenes.These two scenes have been spoiled countless times in the media as of late, but I think it fair to still not disclose them here, so I will be vague. The first features a totally unwarranted rape scene, and the second, the very final scene in the movie; and these segments brutally mar an otherwise character driven, not needlessly bloody or sadistic, tense film. If you think it odd that I cannot forgive shortcomings that comprise perhaps 20 minutes of the total running length I encourage you not to speak until you see them for yourself. If I had the proper equipment i would make my own cut of the movie and remove the scenes which also, and perhaps not coincidently, add nothing to the narrative as well as being downright repugnant and excessive.As I have alluded to in other reviews, performances in horror films are becoming more and more of an asset, whereas older horror films relied on (then) shocking scenes top draw in audiences. Every performance is standout, particularly the main villain and protagonist, played by Garret Dillahunt and Tony Goldwyn respectively. Retreating to their family cottage for the weekend, the Collingwood's, Mari ( Sara Paxton), Emma ( Monica Porter) and John (Goldwyn) have planned out a period of relaxation and rejuvenation. Heading into town one day, Mari meets with an old friend (played by Superbad's Martha MacIsaac) who has partying on the mind. Scoring some drugs however does not lead to the high they imagined as they are taken hostage by a despicable foursome played by Dillahunt (as Krug), Micheal Bowen (as Morton) , Riki Lindhome (as Sadie) and Spencer Treat Clark (as Justin) and the events that unfold lead to coincidence and revenge.Apart from some supremely tense sequences, as mentioned the real strength is in the acting and the compelling character arcs at play. Dillahunt is simply terrifying but never cartoonish, Lindhome as Krug's girlfriend is sadistic but has breaks of subtle humanity that truly add another dimension to her character and Goldwyn is confident but not for a second feels like a superhuman action hero. There is a lot of good to be found in Last House I only wish that those involved had been more confident in what they had and did not resort to the ever growing trend of shock values and sadism.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",The Last House on the Left

I can't imagine how they could have told this story any better. The acting was superb, the script very believable and the directing was near perfect. The best acting was by the mother, played by Monica Potter, although I can't fault any of them.
I don't want to outline the plot as it has already been done but it is a story of abuse, desperation and revenge. The family who have been wronged are very likeable right from the start so you can't help but really route for them all the way through.

106,MetalGeek,"Nothing' Fancy, Just Good Violent Revenge Fantasy",7,1 September 2009,"I'm just as sick as anyone of re-makes of classic films. In the case of Wes Craven's ""Last House On The Left,"" however, I was fairly ambivalent when the remake was announced because though I'd seen the original many years ago, I didn't have any ""personal"" feelings about the film (it was a decent, nasty, revenge fantasy but nowhere near the classic it's been made out to be over the years) so I went into the 2009 version with no expectations, good or bad. I haven't seen the original ""LHOTL"" in over twenty years so I'm honestly not sure how much of the story has been changed or updated. Things get moving fairly quickly in this update, where we first see a scummy criminal named ""Krug"" (Garret Dillahunt) being freed from a police escort (violently) by his gang of ruthless thugs including his brother and girlfriend. We then meet the ""good guys"" of the film, the Collingwood family - Mom and Dad (played by Tony Goldwyn of ""Ghost"" fame and Monica ""I look like Julia Roberts in a blonde wig"" Potter) and their teenage daughter Mari, who are returning to their isolated lake vacation home for the first time since the death of their oldest child a year previously. Mari heads off to town to spend the night with her local pal Paige, which proves to be a mistake, as they meet the teenage ""Justin"" in a convenience store and take him up on his offer to smoke some weed at his parents' motel room while they're out for the afternoon. When Justin's ""family"" returns, guess who his Dad is? The ruthless Krug, who is annoyed to see his kid, who of course is supposed to be keeping a low profile, mixing with the locals. The gang of thugs (including the unwilling Justin, who seems to be a pretty nice, if introverted, kid) toss the girls in the car and drive into the woods, where the girls get slapped around and terrorized for a while, until they cause the car to crash. Paige is stabbed to death and in the most graphic and disturbing scene in the movie, Mari is brutally raped by Krug. When Mari attempts to flee, she gets shot in the back and falls into the lake. Figuring she's dead, the gang tries to find shelter from an oncoming storm and as anyone who's seen the trailers knows, they wind up knocking on the door of Mari's Mom and Dad, who welcome the strange travelers in and allow them to stay the night. Once the bad guys are sent off to the guest house for the night, things get nasty very quickly when the half-dead, brutalized Mari crawls back onto Mom and Dad's doorstep and they realize that the perpetrators who did this to their child are the same people who they welcomed into their home. From there it's lots of good violent gory fun as Mom and Dad avenge their daughter's honor and pick off the bad guys in the most graphic ways possible. By this time anyone who's got kids will be cheering for the parents, especially when Potter goes Mama Bear on Krug's head with a heavy duty fire extinguisher. Krug and his gang are some of the scuzziest movie bad guys I've seen in a long time so I sure as hell wanted to see them receive some payback.Be warned that ""Last House on the Left"" does not flinch when it comes to brutal violence so this is definitely not something for the kiddies, but for grownups who can handle the carnage, this remake is worth watching - and for discussing afterward. Would you do the same things that the Collingwood parents did to defend/avenge their child? How far would you be willing to go?",The Last House on the Left

But just as I was about to turn this one off too, Mari shows up at the house. And things take an eventful and scary turn. The second half of the film is well paced, well acted and very tense.On the whole, I'm glad I watched it - it's certainly a better class of horror remake. The cinematography is atmospheric, John Murphy's soundtrack is very good and only occasionally intrusive, and it knocks the original film out of the water.

110,Flixer1957,The Old Craven Estate vs. This New House,5,25 March 2009,"This so-called ""remake"" of Wes Craven's trend-setting cult movie may have some impact--on those who've never seen the original. As I sat watching this, I tried to take it on its own terms and avoid comparisons to the 1972 model. I couldn't help myself, howeverpossibly because the old HOUSE had so much more to offer.Here are the main strengths of the original LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT:A) The fact that nobody had ever seen anything like it before. It may have ""borrowed"" its story from Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING but the unflinching, ""you-are-there-at-a-murder-scene"" brutality was unprecedented.B) The characters, good and bad, were convincing and well-developed, in a short amount of time.C) The movie kept throwing curves at the audience from one scene to the next.The new one, on the other hand, features flat characters with little personality. Which, come to think of it, may be appropriate since people in general are shallower and less interesting today than they were in the 1970s.There is none of the original's scary atmosphere or sense of suspense. This movie is strictly by-the-numbers. There are some plot deviations from the original, but most of them don't work. The cast doesn't have a quarter of the screen presence of Fred Lincoln, Lucy Grantham, et al. As ringleader Krug, Garret Dillahunt is nasty, but he gnaws his scenes whereas David Hess gnashed his, and spat them out. In the new HOUSE, Monica Potter and Sara Paxton aren't bad but the best and most intense actor here is Riki Lindhome, who plays Sadie. (Named, I'm sure, after Susan ""Sadie"" Atkins--talk about intense.) I'm going to look up her other films as soon as I post this review.Hell, even the generic posters for the 2009 remake are lackluster compared to the 1972 one-sheets of Krug & Company in action. Knives, a pistol and a fireplace poker come into play here, as they did the first time out. Is there disembowelment, death by chainsaw and another ""scene by the lake?"" See this flick for yourself and find outI had to!!!!If you're in the mood for a bloody revenge pot-boiler with the bad guys getting the sort of payback that seldom comes their way in real life, this new HOUSE is worth one look......though I would watch an Unrated version if such a thing is ever issued on DVD.",The Last House on the Left
111,trnjamesbond,"Last House, WOW! It's all grown up!",8,3 October 2010,"I just reviewed this title. The first viewing, I ended up liking it. But the second. I realized, that this film was remade to the point of Adulthood. It was a simple story written during the times of the Texas Chainsaw Massecre. But it's one of those films where it needs a resurfacing. It's one of those films where both versions are great. I really love the first Krug the most, but in the remake I liked him almost as much. I realized it didn't matter so much on the face of the Demon, but the writing. Both interpretations were great, no matter how you look at it. If the prime actress survives or not. Well I think this movie did both.The mother and father's character were a lot stronger in this version, and seem a little more intelligent, The mother was very attractive and the father was very intelligent also that was nice to watch, this was the underlying sub plot I think. To make us feel like a smart audience, and not to dumb us down to the point it becomes ridiculous. Hollywood has actually done something right when it came to this remake. You see you can remake a film if you get the right people and the proper writers, and you could tell that the people behind the lens actually cared about what they were doing, instead of trying to cash in on some iconic cult classic and making the film as fast as possible, so they can cash in on the success. When you actually take the time and work hard I think you can remake any horror film great. This film proves it!In turn, it made us feel in a certain way, it also made me feel that this story must be retold, watching the remake, it's like reading a favourite book. If it's transfered to film in the right way the story will be intelligently told to unsuspecting generations too come. I rate this very highly out of all the remakes that have been made, even though I usually hate them. But in this circumstance I vote it a watch and maybe a collectible film. Bravo! on the Directors of this remake. And thank you Wes Craven. Even though the some of the scenes were dulled down but still entertaining.I really like the radiated ending.....Thanks for reading",The Last House on the Left
112,alanmora,"Pretty good, for a re-make",7,23 March 2009,"If you've ever read any of my other reviews you know how I feel personally about re-makes. Most horror fans feel the same way I do (yet we still watch these things!) so needless to say I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well this one was. Yes there are the usual cases of character name changes, scene and dialog changes and complete story line changes for no apparent reason but the basic premise that made the original film so creepy was somehow still retained. The major story line change in this one has been discussed in previous reviews and revolves around main character Mari (I won't reveal any major changes for the benefit of those who haven't seen it yet) and yes I was EXTREMELY disappointed with these changes but as I said I went into the film expecting to be let down so this helped to soften the blow. This version of ""Last House on the Left"" has a considerable amount of added gore sequences as well but they are not overly done or thrown in for no apparent reason other than shock value (as was the case in the unofficial 'Last House on the Left' re-make 'Chaos' directed by David DeFalco). Nowadays there really is no way to re-create the grainy, almost documentary like filming style of the original which is one of the main elements that added to the general feel of the film, but these filmmakers did an exceptional job of making the viewer curl in disgust at the actions of the villains and cheer and applaud the violence that befalls them. If you enjoyed the original you will most likely enjoy this one as well...just make sure you watch it and avoid the aforementioned ""Chaos"".",The Last House on the Left

It almost felt like the film was happening in real time, which gave that extra bit of paranoia to the project. When the movie unraveled it spiraled out of control giving a sort of hypnotic attractiveness. It lured you in and kept you hyper focused on each event, which allowed for the extreme scenes to have no limits, giving it that great tension. I genuinely don't believe that this could've been achieved if the acting wasn't as good as it was. Each character had depth, had more to them than just ""a father"" ""a rapist"" ""a victim"". These were real people, and that came across through the screen. The Final thing that I appreciated was the feel of the movie. It's hard to explain, but the tone of the scene, the weather, and the timing really vamped up the movies importance. To top it all off, the film had a very classic horror vibe which was terrific.CONS: The biggest thing that bothered me was the resolution.

I saw it afterwords and felt uncomfortable and bit angry.The story is not bad and the acting was very good. Soon as we met the girls, i knew something horrible was going to happen. The rape scene i thought was very unnecessary, we don't need to see many angles and shots of the scene happening and it also dragged. When watching that scene, I was thinking ""ok thats enough we don't need to see anymore"". I don't mind gore but rape is too much and too realistic, horror doesn't need rape.I would have to say the tension was pretty good when the parents found out what happened and chasing after the villains, that was about it.The ending was ridiculous and rushed. Tell me, how can a microwave still work when it's open and make a head explode? What it is happening with horror films these days? This one seemed more concentrated on the personal violence and gore, I don't think thats how horror/thriller should be.People were right about it not being for the weak hearted.

All sorts of suspense and opportunities for vengeance arise, and the payoff is both gruesome and satisfying. Some subtle plot points have been modified very effectively, so somehow this one manages to be even more graphic and squirm-inducing than the original, which was considered edgy for its time.

122,MWNiese,Respectable Horror Remake,7,20 March 2009,"SEVEN OUT OF TEN STARS The only types of movies that I'll pay to see in theaters a horror movies, and I had a great time viewing this horror film; this is coming from an ""old school"" horror fan that loathes the recent and ridiculous onslaught of horror remakes. If it hadn't been for those two bimbos in the theater sitting in front of me text messaging, whispering to each other in an effort to understand the plot, and standing to go to the bathroom at the worst possible times, I would have had a great time at this film. But really, considering how low the horror genre has sunk, we that care about the long term survival of the horror genre should be happy for this remake entry.The quality of this remake most likely has much to do with Craven's active participation on the production end. I don't think Craven wanted to see his baby massacred, like what Zombie did to Carpenter's ""Halloween"". Wouldn't it have been nice if Carpenter had taken a more active voice in the remakes of his endearing ""Halloween"" and ""The Fog""? But I don't think Carpenter really wanted, or was able, to put much input into those remakes. Craven's interest in the ""TLHOTL"" remake is similar to his interest in ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake, which DEFINITELY has been the best horror remake of the decade; And YES the ""Hills"" remake is better than the ""Last House"" remake! ""The Last House on the Left"" remake is pretty faithful to the original, in that it's story line centers upon a small group of deranged felons kidnapping, torturing, and raping two beautiful young women. The father of one of the young victims eventually has the opportunity to exact revenge upon the murderers, almost by a series of freak accidents, that land the murderers' on one of the doctor's front doorsteps. The story is a classic allegory Craven adapted from Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"". It's a fascinating story that intrigues people, as many of us find ourselves wondering if we could personally take the life of another human being under similar circumstances. The ""Last House"" remake is a great film, but again it simply doesn't top the raw violence, brutal sexuality, and socially critical presence of Craven's original. And how could it? 1972 was a different time: Not everyone had seen 5,000 hours of on screen violence in 1972. Today by age 13, teenage boys have seen a wide spectrum of sexual violence and homicidal maniacal acts of destruction. And you can be assured that the Nazis at the MPAA weren't going to let this version of ""Last House"" get distributed with another film's ""R"" rating spliced onto the beginning. It's evident to me that the the violence and sexuality are toned down in the remake. The brutal realness and raw sexuality just isn't as intense as in the original. Another item of interest is the use of ""hand held"" shots at times, which I've disagree with in just about every horror movie I've see since 2000. The film making process has evolved so much since movies like the original ""Last House"" were made; it seems to me that film makers could come up with something more than the ""shaky"" camera angle to scare us. It makes me dizzy and it's unprofessional; save the wobbly shot for film school guys. The remake of ""Last House"" really didn't seem to have much to say under the surface either, while the original definitely made pokes and jabs at societal norms. The remake script was acceptable but really wasn't overly intelligent in any way. I also thought by portraying the main female victim (Mary) as a rich doctor's ""princess"" daughter, lessened the sympathy level for me. Honestly, Craven's main victim in the original was much easier to sympathize with; she was more mainstream. For me personally, I'm not the biggest fan of rich doctors' daughter ""princesses"" who are too good for 99% of eligible bachelors. I could have cared less if she (Mary) died in the remake.But hey, beggars can't be choosers. The ""Last House"" remake is the best remake to come along since ""The Hills"" redoing. Movie studios should take notice of the ""Last House"" remake and maybe take some cues, like involving the original creators of great horror films in the production end of the remake. As a Hollywood hater and horror remake hater, I recommend this film to horror fans everywhere.",The Last House on the Left
123,RichardKleiner,"Pointless gore, unfruitful script and lousy ending.",3,21 June 2009,"Oh boy, if had to choose between this and Star Trek. Unfortunately for me, residing in the Mexican town of Celaya, ST wasn't available in my schedule to watch, so the rest of my family decided to watch this.After the credits, I noticed it was a remake of a Wes Craven film. This is just one of many movies in a sad trend of remaking every work by Mr. Craven. I haven't seen the original, but for what I have seen here, there wasn't much of a story to tell. I thought it followed the same storyline as ""Deliverance"", but without the outstanding performances or memorable music.The story follows a young girl who, after several mix-ups, ends up being held hostage by a pair of criminals led by an escaped convict. She miraculously escapes, and later, the criminals arrive at her parent's summer house. In this odd coincidence, the parents later discover the truth and slowly but surely, end up executing all of their evil-doers. There wasn't much to the script other than this premise, which may have worked better for a short film, not a full length picture.But, the main problem is that this story is told for the sheer purpose of showing you blood and gore. I guess it was meant to show a normal family turning into killers due to aggravating circumstances. But, other than that, there is no lesson to be learned, no emotional situation to be explored. There's a lot of drama, but it's not properly handled.It would have been interesting to see the Main Bad Guy's relation to his son in the past, or see more interaction between the girl and her parents. The dad has sort of an attitude at the beginning, blaming his brother in law for almost everything, and later, he's just a vicious torturer. This brother in law, by the way, is merely mentioned and not seen anywhere later.You can tell the writers tried to add some more juice to the already predictable and dull scenes, including some long dialogs, extending scenes with more and more tension and having a character take forever to die. All of this sure ensues a running time of +90 minutes, but it's tedious and boring.By the end, where you think the main bad guy got killed, it turns out that the dad had him paralyzed and stuffed his head in a microwave. Why would he do that? That's too vicious. And, yes, you do get to see the head exploding, making it even more gross and unnecessary than it already is.The score by John Murphy also aids in creating tension, but don't expect to play some of that unlistenable audio on you stereo. As for the technical aspects, it's competently made, even for the gory scenes, coming from your average crew of unknowns. The gore here sure is realistic and not over the top (except for the microwave finale).Overall, the story goes nowhere and the violence and gore make it nearly unwatchable. If you find blood splashing and that sort of things entertaining, you'll enjoy it. If you want a story worth telling, I suggest Star Trek.",The Last House on the Left

A huge improvement to the original was a consistently dark atmosphere. In Wes Craven's version, it felt silly at times, namely the scenes with the cops and the whole ""Willow"" stuff. This remake was also a lot more intense and suspenseful, and the danger felt a lot more real. The ending may somewhat blunt the movie's overall effect, but, hey, how often do you get that sort of ending in a horror movie? The rape scene was very difficult to sit through because it was so long and realistic, which is my only real complaint. If you had to choose to watch the original or the remake, I would go with the remake because it's a lot more thrilling, and it's far superior to Wes Craven's version overall.",The Last House on the Left
126,MetalAngel,A good example of what TRUE psychological horror is.,8,6 September 2009,"There is more to the genre of terror than sudden spooks and surprises behind every corner, like many of the last horror thrillers have been relying on to gain the appeal of audiences. A true horror film plays with the psychological state of the viewer, and presents situations in uninhibited and prolonged situations of true suspense that shatter your nerves and makes you futilely grip the edge of your seat. Thankfully, Dennis Iliadis' latest version of Wes Craven's classic ""The Last House on the Left"" is a clear example of the latter.The story begins simple. A family where the father is a successful doctor (Tony Goldwyn), the mother is a respectable socialite (Monica Potter) and the daughter is a perfectly likable teenager (Sara Paxton) live in the city for an extended period of time after the death of their firstborn son, but suddenly they decide they're over it and chose to move back to their old place. The house where they lived before, coincidentally, is situated smack down the middle of a solitary yet beautiful forest, so you may imagine the premise this movie takes: it cries out the slogan ""In the forest no one can hear you scream"", and although this is a much overused setting, the film doesn't rely on the solitude and darkness of the forest itself to produce its tension...although it helps the feeling of loneliness.During their first day, the parents are anxious to cheerfully re-acquaint themselves with the house, whose last occupant was their deceased eldest, and beg their daughter to stay with them through a 'fun-filled evening'. The daughter, nevertheless, wants nothing to do with the house and chooses to search out for her best friend Paige and spend the evening with her.Paige is your usual rebel teen, smoking pot and getting drunk, and she works in a drive-by store. In the store, both friends meet an awkward and sad-looking teen (Spencer Treat Clark) who befriends them and entices them to come back to his apartment where he has a stash of dope. They oblige. But while getting stoned in his apartment, three menacing people barge into the room, and we discover they're the teen's dad, his brother and his cheap female crone. They're wanted for murder, rape and a whole shebang of delinquency. Now, the teen assures the two horrified friends they were not supposed to arrive so soon, but the fact of the matter is they've both identified the runaways, so it's really out of the question to let them go away.These three diabolical characters do an array of unpleasant things with the two girls (I'll spare myself the details), but they have an accident (of sorts), they loose the two girls and, wounded, they seek out the nearest house where they can get assistance from some good Samaritan who might help them...and they unknowingly find the house of the girl's parents. Oh sure, the parents help them out and are very cordial to these strangers, but little do they know their ravaged daughter is, as they speak, dragging her mangled self over to their house! Beans will spill.What happens then is, well...the rest of the film, and I'll let you discover that for yourself. It's a highly suspenseful, taut and thoroughly gripping tale of true psychological horror. Oh, don't get me wrong, there is plenty of violence for you gore-seekers, but the horror really reaches into your worst nightmares and makes you wince not at the violence but at the general plot line. The music is nerve-shattering and the photography is, well, what you could expect from a horror film- dark, mysterious and unforgiving.I haven't seen the original 1977 version, but this film is a very good demonstration of what an ""enjoyable"" (note the quotation marks) film is supposed to be. And, by Jove, the ending will extract a shriek from those who aren't stone-hearted. See this soon! And, umno, that's all I've got to say.Rating: 3 stars out of 4!!",The Last House on the Left
127,windypoplar,good vs. evil or vengeance is mine?,6,1 September 2009,"The original ""Last House"" was one of the sickest, most disturbing movies I ever saw. I wasn't sure how this remake would be, considering how poor the ""Friday the 13th"" reboot was... This ""Last House"" is just as good, if not better, than Wes Craven's seminal '72 version. Sara Paxton is Mari, bored at the lake house her parents go to every summer and bummed out by her brother Ben's recent death, goes to the city to catch up with her friend Paige, played by Martha MacIsaac of all people! She on ""Emily of New Moon"" fame, talk about an image-changer! They are approached by Justin to partake of some prime weed and guess who comes back early? Yes, it's the deranged psycho ""family"" we met in the gruesome opening scenes! Nice setup! Mari and Paige are brutalized in the woods, Mari is raped and it is a awful scene to watch, though I prefer the unrated one, just adds more disgust to Krug. Both are left for dead. When a storm strikes, Krug, his brother Frank, Justin and Krug's really odd girlfriend Sadie, look for shelter, they have the incredibly bad luck of choosing the last house on the left. Cue music. Heh.The movie doesn't take too long in getting going, in fact the pacing is excellent, and soon Mari's parents know who these creeps are and what they did. A bit unclear if they realize about Paige though. They decide to take matters into their own hands and well do... The brutality with which they strike seems to indicate we are all very near the beasts we rose from. It would have helped if either Tony Goldwyn or Monica Potter had been better actors. Neither is able to summon the volcanic rage I would have felt. Potter is nervous throughout film and frankly, irritating. Goldwyn is just too reserved, even when battling Krug. Some of the violence is more cartoonish than I would have liked, the last shot involving the microwave is really lame. still you can't feel any sympathy for Krug considering what he is. What surprised me and pleased me about this was the style of the film, Dennis Iliadis really does well here, the sign that makes no sense, the minimalist brutality, offset by the quiet charm of the house. Note the end shots of the seemingly tranquility of the last house, but the viewer knows what went down. The music is good too. The film leaves just enough unsaid, inf act the script could be accused of offering too little for the actors to work with, how did Ben die? What, if anything, is the point of the hydrangea bush? Was Mari's fight worth it, did it change anything? what the hell is up with the opening pool shot? Are both girls Mari? All in all this is a good flick, it is graphic, but no more than a hundred other movies. Kudos to Craven and Iliadis for doing right by a classic film and to Sara Paxton, whose previous work has been pretty light, but manges some nice nuances here.",The Last House on the Left

So, when a remake was announced, I was happy to see it. Is ""Last House '09"" worth seeing? It is, actually. And as a matter of fact, it beats the original by a mile.The acting is way better. Garret Dillahunt is very menacing as Krug, and the same goes for Tony Goldwyn as John and Emma Collingwood, Sara Paxton as their daughter Mari, who does a superb job with such a challenging role for her, Aaron Paul as Francis, Riki Lindhome as Sadie, Spencer Treat Clark as Justin, and Martha MacIsaac of Superbad fame as Paige.Director Dennis Illiadis tones down the violence and creates a lot of suspense, especially during the dreadfully uncomfortable rape scene. He is a great director, and I hope to see more films from him.As big a classic as the original was, there were plenty of things wrong with it: No suspense, the wrong music, and bad acting. The remake fixes everything, and hits all the right buttons throughout the movie. When I saw it, people were very disturbed for the first half of the movie, and when Krug and company got their comeuppance, they were standing up and cheering.Of course, ""The Last House on the Left"" isn't for everyone, only for those who go in knowing what they're in for. It's one of the greatest and most effective pieces of recent horror, and I think that horror junkies will love it. I know I did.

131,Clintekabor,You ready to be a man,8,21 December 2020,"The Last House on the Left is unrelenting and extremely tense. It pushes the boundaries on it's themes as it drags you through a brutal story of violence and revenge. It is psychologically challenging to watch, and you really want retribution to happen to the films antagonists.The biggest lesson to learn from this film is do not trust people you don't know. And how easily you can end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.This film puts you through a rollercoaster of emotions such as dread, concern, anticipation and other moments that will leave you feeling queasy. You will feel very uncomfortable and if you are like me then sometimes you might wince and grit your teeth.I found one scene extremely difficult and unsettling to watch, I really just wanted it to be over and very quickly. However afterwards it did make me feel more emotionally compassionate for the victim and I was much more determined to see her survive to the end.The acting would have been difficult in some scenes due to the nature of this film so all need to be admired with a special mention to Garret Dillahunt who played Krug the gangs leader. He was ruthless and created a truly unlikeable character who you hope in the end get what they deserve.Spencer Treat Clark, (Justine) Riki Lindome,(Sadie) and Aaron Paul (Francis) were commendable in their roles and Sara Paxton (Mari) was impressive in the early stages of the film and did a truly remarkable job to show her diversity as an actress.I also enjoyed the family cohesion between the Father (John) and the Mother (Emma) played by Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter respectively. And their strong bond and trust of each other which helps them handle the terrifying situation that they find themselves in.I was honestly surprised by this film and I found the Last House on the Left to be much better than I anticipated. It is graphically violent and the very last scene of the film was questionable on whether it is a actually possible or realistic.

The only reason I bought ""The Last House On The Left: Extended Version (2009)"" was because of Tony Goldwyn.But I must say that I was very surprised with this one. I have seen A LOT of films in my time (I'm 29 years old) and a lot of disturbing films, and this one is definitely one of them. The raping scene (no spoiler!) was very intense and even more difficult to watch, and when the parents are having their revenge I was cheering like a little school boy. Tony Goldwyn is brilliant (as always) as the father who seeks revenge for his daughter's torturing and raping. Though there is a longer passage with nothing else happening than the villains running around, the film gets back on track when Mr. Goldwyn and his Mrs. start to slice'n'dice the bad guys - You can't avoid getting a sadistic smile and loving THIS torture.To say one minor good thing is that the film is an AWEFULLY slow starter. It takes forever to get the film starting, but when it happens, it has been worth the wait.""The Last House On The Left: Extended Version (2009)"" is a dark and violent thriller, which I recommend to everyone who likes a good and gruesome thrill.",The Last House on the Left

137,dolemite72,Watered down nonsense,1,14 June 2009,"Seriously....what is it with this trend of remaking classics, and replacing the casts with Benetton models? This movie was weak, compared to the 1972 original. It copped out on all the 'sleazy' elements that MADE the original such a hit, and replaced it with silly macho heroics, a cast devoid of ANY personality, and pointless gore. Look at the 1972 version.....that was a nasty movie, that earned the criticism it provoked. The cast was excellent, haunting music, just enough on-screen violence to get it's point across, but plenty of what Hollywood is too scared to replicate nowadays......NASTINESS. At least the original portrayed what actually happens to people taking the law into their own hands, in a realistic manner. This remake gives the impression that it's OK to torture people, afterwards (losing all of what made the original movie so dark) Look at the end of LHOTL (72) the father and mother are morbidly disgusted by their actions (however justified) and are soon to be carted off to prison for their actions. The remake has no connection with reality at all, and even feels the need to tack on an extra amount of added brutality, as if to keep up with HOSTEL 2, whilst forgetting that it's missed the point completely and portrayed the parents as even bigger psychopaths (hell, their daughter doesn't even die in this one!!!!!)In the original, i actually felt sorry for Mari and Phyliss (they came across as ordinary-looking, young girls) which made the actions of Krug & Co, even more deplorable. The (ahem) actresses in this one were vile, Hannah Montana wannabes (with zero personality, character or dialogue) Don't get me started on the Krug from 2009 version either.......All-in-all, another nail in the coffin of genuine 'horror' cinema, by the hacks at Hollywood (who treat it's audiences with the contempt, you obviously deserve)Shame on Wes Craven, for having anything to do with it (he surely has enough money, these days?)",The Last House on the Left
138,stewiefan201,"If you go to see it, you better know what you're in for.",8,23 March 2009,"The Last House on the Left is about a normal family on vacation by their lakeside home. The day they drive out to the lake, their daughter Mari (Sara Paxton) leaves with the family car to meet up with her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac). Mari and Paige eventually hang out with a strange kid named Justin, until his estranged family of three murderous criminals, led by his father Krug (Garrett Dillahunt), show up. They beat and rape the girls and leave them for dead out by the lake. The three murderers soon find Mari's parents house, and unknowingly to them decide to spend the rainy night there. However Mari survives the attack and swims back home, her parents find her, and also gain the knowledge that her attackers are the their guests. They have no car, no help, and no way out. All they can do is fight back. From there on in Mari's parents exact bloody revenge on Krug and his family of thugs.May I start off saying that I have completely given up on the MPAA. The fact that a film this grotesque and realistically violent did not receive the NC-17 rating is shocking. The Last House on the Left is not one of those horror movies that uses in-your-face gore effects, and preposterous scenes of torturous violence. Everything displayed in this movie is realistic and very much possible, making it all the more terrifying. If you go to see it, you better know what you're in for. This movie contains a rape scene that really gets under your skin, and other scenes of gory mayhem. I am not trying to make this film sound bad though. This is one of the best horror remakes I've ever seen. The acting is terrific, the suspense is grueling, and even the script is pretty good for a horror flick. The violent acts the three felons commit made me truly hate their characters, and want them to suffer horrible fates. This movie does not disappoint in that category. In fact I would go as far as to say it's one of the most rewarding horror flicks I've seen a very long time.The acting in this movie is also very good and memorable, which is a big surprise for a horror movie. The villains are well acted, especially by Garrett Dillahunt and Aaron Paul. They never deviate from the authentic awfulness of their characters. Sara Paxton and Martha McIsaac are also very good. But the pair that really makes the film worth watching are Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter. They both give commanding, unforgettable performances that only make the movie more memorable. My only real problems with the film are that despite its realistic intentions, it is still very mainstream in terms of horror. We've seen this type of story done many times before in many different ways. The other problem I had with it is that despite how much I enjoyed it, it's not the type of movie I would watch over and over again.All in all The Last House on the Left is a very good horror movie. It's one the best remakes in years, boasting excellent visuals, great acting, and violence not to be reckoned with. I give it a 4 out of 5.",The Last House on the Left

140,pseawrig,Another poorly executed remake,3,21 February 2010,"The 1972 movie by Wes Craven is a far superior film.Thirty-seven years later, this ""update"" offers little more than a richer sound mix, lots of gliding camera work, and trendy HG-TV styled sets. It stupidly creates a prison break back-story and even more stupidly tries to keep all of the ""nice"" characters alive to make us feel warm and fuzzy inside. Not only does this go against the grain of true horror, but it undermines the motivation for the no-holds-barred vengeance that makes up the movie's third act.Horror remakes can be fine if, as in Dawn of the Dead or Halloween, they significantly re-imagine the story and its themes. All this film does is lavish money on sets, sentimentalize the characters, and pump a little more blood.This version does feature good performances from three compelling actors: Tony Goldwyn, Garret Dillahunt, and Aaron Paul (Jesse from Breaking Bad). Unfortunately, they are squandered on a movie that is showy, mawkish, and dumb. For God's sake, rent the original, which is stark, sober, and smart.

144,IheartCali5882,It's so contrived....and yet...I still enjoyed it,7,28 February 2010,"The original Last House on the Left excelled better than its successor based on shock value alone. But Wes Cravens version had a rawness and grit that was missing from this remake. The story remains the same; following an All-American family on their vacation to an ambiguous farmhouse in the woods. The daughter leaves the family to spend time with friends only to find herself in the hands of criminals who do all types of unspeakable things to her. I won't say exactly what but for those who've heard anything about the original; they know what I'm talking about.The problem with this remake is that it wants to be better than it really is. This is not to say that's it's particularly bad because it's not. I thoroughly enjoyed myself but it didn't carry the impact I thought it would. What's missing here is a lot of exposition and character development. I didn't care as much about the daughter and the family as I should have. It's like: OK here we have a rape. Rape is bad so my conscience tells me that I should feel bad for the daughter. (Insert emotion here). I didn't feel any real connection to the characters that would have allowed me to really get involved in the story. Additionally, the villains weren't very believable. Their roles seemed entirely contrived and even silly in places. I mean how many awkward unrealistic silences can you have when you're with a room full of strangers you've never met and the hairs on the back of your neck still don't raise up? This only happens in the movies. In real life you would have gotten rid of them immediately because it's obvious their long pregnant pauses are hiding something very sinister. The film would have been better had these scenes played out with complete ease. Villains making sinister glares have been cheesy for the past 20 years or so.IN SPITE OF ALL THIS, the movie is exciting and it does keep your attention. I think it's more expectation than anything else. How can this plot be uninteresting? It's almost impossible. It's in our nature to want to get revenge on those who harm us. And what's more vulnerable than a young daughter who's been violated in unspeakable ways? The movie could be near to awful and we'd still tune in to see how the antagonists get their comeuppance. This movie is nowhere near awful. It's just that it's not as good as it thinks it is. Still worth a watch. And it even holds up for repeat viewings.My rating: 6.4 Good tension and some rather good performances from Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter.",The Last House on the Left

146,keiichi73,Empty violence and cheap thrills,3,13 March 2009,"If there's a lesson to be learned from The Last House on the Left, it's this - If you ever see a suspicious-looking and awkward teen lurking in the dark corner of a supermarket, and he offers to take you to his seedy motel room for some weed, don't go with him. Thanks, Hollywood. I'll be sure to remember that next time I'm in such a situation.It's too bad that teenage friends Mari (Sara Paxton) and Paige (Martha MacIssac) learn the lesson the movie wants to impart with us a little too late. They follow the teen named Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) back to his room, hoping for a party, only to learn that his family are a group of psychotic killers on the run from the law. We witness in the film's opening scene how Justin's father, Krug (Garret Dillahunt), Uncle Francis (Aaron Paul), and Krug's girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome) murdered a couple of police detectives. (Just to let us know they're *really* evil, the movie makes us watch Krug strangle one of the detectives with a car seatbelt and forces him to bleed all over a family photo of the detective's children.) The murder has made front page news, and the family doesn't want any witnesses, so Krug and the others take the two girls out to the woods to have their way with them. Paige ends up dead, and Mari ends up getting raped and left for dead when she tries to escape and is hit by a stray bullet. With a storm bearing down on the local area, the killers decide to take refuge in the closest house nearby, which just happens to belong to Mari's parents, John (Tony Goldwyn) and Emma (Monica Potter).John, Emma, and Mari have come to the house for a much-needed family vacation after dealing with the tragedy the past year of their eldest son, Ben, dying. When the killers arrive at the house, wounded and disheveled (Mari and Paige got a few hits in on them before they were overpowered), the parents initially have no idea, as they think their daughter is staying overnight with the friend. Then young Justin begins to feel racked with guilt when he realizes who the house belongs to, and begins to leave little signs for the parents to discover who they are and what they did. When Mari manages to drag herself to the front porch of the house and the parents discover her clinging to what little life she has left, they decide to take the law into their own hands by seeking bloody vengeance. This is obviously intended to be a thorny moral issue. Heck, the film's poster even asks us ""If bad people hurt someone you loved, how far would you go to hurt them back""? Too bad it never has any intention of answering this question, as The Last House on the Left is an entirely exploitive and cheap enterprise designed solely as a gore show.Yes, there is quite a lot of gore. The R-rating is put into effect as we get to see close up and graphic depictions of stabbings, rapes, attempted drownings, fingers being cut off in a kitchen garbage disposal, blood-splattered shootings, and to top it off, someone being paralyzed then stuck in a microwave until their head explodes. The problem is the movie stops at the shock value of these images. There's nothing behind them other than the filmmakers wanted to maybe raise a concerned eyebrow or two. The only way a story like The Last House on the Left could work is if we actually cared about or were interested in what was going on, or about the people these things are happening to. But we don't, because everyone who exists in this movie exists for a single narrow-minded purpose. The daughter exists solely to be raped, the daughter's friend to be murdered, the villains to do terrible things and then have terrible things happen to them...There are no real relationships on display, not even within the family. Mere moments after they arrive at the vacation home, the daughter runs off to be with her friend. It's like she knows what the audience is here for, and wants to give it to them as quickly as possible.Not only does this cheapen the entire film, but it actually managed to lessen the impact of the film's harsher sequences with me. The characters are so single-minded in their motivation, I had a hard time seeing them as people instead of merely as manipulations of the screenplay. The movie asks us how far would we go to find vengeance, but the characters of John and Emma never do. As soon as they find their daughter and discover what's happened to her, they grab the nearest sharp or blunt object, and start going after the killers. There's no pause for questioning, asking if what they're doing is right, or even a moment's hesitation. Like everyone else, they know what they're here for. (The fact that the characters literally have nothing to do with anything in the movie until the final 40 minutes or so is proof of this.) This could have been a tense and terrifying dramatic thriller, but because the movie never strays from the expected path or gives us anything to think about, we're simply left to wait for the inevitable.The film's sole saving grace is that the director Dennis Iliadis shows some talent here. I hope he can get attached to a real movie next time around. The Last House on the Left is for people who don't care what's going on up on the screen, as long as they get to see some severed limbs. When the film's poster asks smarter and tougher questions than anything brought up in the movie itself, you've got a problem.",The Last House on the Left
147,peterlane5,It didn't bother me as much because most of the violence is directed at the bad guys,7,15 February 2011,"I was dragged to this by my friends when it first came out in theaters. The whole ""rated R for sadistic brutal violence and a rape"" made me not want to see it and I had it in my mind that it would be far more sadistic than it actually is. One of the best suspense movies I've seen in a while. It really isn't a horror movie because it really isn't scary. It's more of a Crime/Drama The only thing that bothered me was the rape scene which I about walked out of the theater because it was so disturbing and I will skip that part when I watch the UNRATED DVD. My favorite character was Justin, because even though his dad is a sadistic killer, he has a sense of what is right and wrong. I also liked how Riki Lindhome(Sadie) plays a psycho in this can play the total opposite in My Best Friend's Girl. I must also give credit to Garret Dillahunt who plays a brutal criminal is this yet in Raising Hope, plays a hilarious dad/granddad.

154,Clothes-Off,The fact that they deserve it doesn't make it any better.,3,9 November 2009,"I often lament that writers rarely get their due when a film is praised. So many times directors and actors get lauded for movies that have outstanding screenplays and stories, while the person who gave them their words escapes notice.Well, turnabout is fair play; so if I'm willing to give credit where credit is due, I shall place the blame where it is due in this case. It's Wes Craven's story and Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth's screenplay.I have not seen Wes Craven's original film, so looking at this film on it's own merits, I must say there are few. It's not that I'm squeamish, I just needed more to justify all I was witnessing on screen. We basically see two scenarios unfold, innocent people being violently victimized, and then what when the perpetrators ""meet the parents"".What could have been a psychological drama (and they still could have kept the horror) just turns into pure carnage. It would have been interesting to see the main characters (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter) wrestle with moral ambiguity of facing their daughter's torturers, but they are not given time to process anything in the kill-or-be situation as it is presented. So the film quickly devolves into just another torture-porn flick, with a tacked on ending just to please TP aficionados. Count me out.",The Last House on the Left

156,zaisjr,A remake of one of Wes Craven's weakest films,3,10 March 2011,"Over the years I have loved to watch Wes Craven's writing and creativity grow. He really gained momentum with the later Freddy films, later making a masterpiece with ""New Nightmare"" with what should have been the last Freddy movie ever made. He hit a masterful stride with the Scream movies. But then things took a turn. He started remaking his old films. After successful remakes of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" parts one and two, he decided to remake his first horror film, ""The Last House on the Left"". This is puzzling because the original movie wasn't very good in the first place. My assumption was that the remake would be a much better movie, but it wasn't really an improvement.The premise of ""Last House on the Left"" is a great one. A group of criminals is on the road performing vile and disgusting acts. Then the irony sets in. They look for a safe haven, but this haven ends up being the home of a victim's parents. Now instead, the vile criminals are begging for their lives. Sounds great huh? How could anyone mess this up? Well, it happened.The film starts with the same old clichés. An irresponsible teenager is hanging out with a foolish and careless teenage friend. These two teenage friends make horrible decisions one after another, a common horror cliché that became outdated and frustrating back in the 90's. These two female teenagers make a poor decision and go back to a run-down motel with a teenage pot head and continue with more foolish decisions. What they don't know is that the teenage boy is the son of an escaped violent criminal. This boy's father, uncle, and father's girlfriend are all sick and twisted individuals. These sick individuals make their intentions known immediately, that they will kill these two girls so that they don't blow the cover of the fugitives. Instead of killing the girls off at first, these fugitives take them on the road and try to get out of the area. One girl tries to escape and the vehicle crashes in the forest. We are then treated to more of a drawn out inevitability, that these two girls are going to face a horrible fate. But instead of seeing that fate right away, the momentum of the film keeps stalling. Then we are finally treated, rather punished, with a stabbing and then a long rape scene. I watched the unrated version of this film and almost vomited from the graphic nature of the rape scene and the longevity of it. Perverts and rapists probably loved it. But I was nauseous for a couple hours after that scene. It wasn't needed. Now the hope was that the revenge by the parents would be redeeming for this film. But it wasn't very redeeming at all. The criminals come to the home of the rape victim and are fed and housed for the night. Then the parents figure out that these criminals raped and shot their daughter. Tension rises and you just can't wait to see the punishment coming. The revenge arrives, but comes along very sloppy and unconvincing. The parents just don't seem all that enraged and the revenge sequences stumble along. Aside from the last scene in the movie, the revenge scenes become too frustrating. Unlike many other revenge films, the protagonists don't seem so motivated or enraged.In summary, this film should never have been re-made, not like this at least. The music and the cinematography were effective, but the rest of the film didn't cut it as a good revenge film. The movie could easily have been an hour long, but instead dragged us through two hours of mediocrity. This is a movie to bypass.",The Last House on the Left

Camera work is mostly ugly, some acting isn't great, and the comic elements don't work and drag things down.

First off, it's not a movie for anyone below 18, simply because of the psychological effect it can have on young kids. Some scenes are painful to watch!That said, the movie has its ups and downs. First, the downs. I can't say I didn't enjoy this movie, it was not very bad like many people said it was. However, it wasn't very good either. First of, it's not a horror or thriller movie. Horror movies should make you feel scared and make you jump out of your seat. This movie is neither scary to watch nor thrilling. It's more story like. So it falls under the wrong genre. And secondly, some scenes are way too overdone (gore and revenge scenes). It should have been left a little undone. I don't want to go into the details, will let your decide for yourself. Having said that, there are quite a few ups in this movie. It certainly is not boring or plain. It has a thought out story line. And everything makes sense.

159,Dean_Jenkins,One Of The Best Experiences I've Had At A Cinema All Around!,7,21 June 2009,"I had watched the original with friends before. What attracted it to us was the way the movie was being put across ""to avoid fainting keep repeating it's just a movie"" etc. We loved horror and anything just generally shocking it was the most fun along with comedy's you could have with friends!. Well it certainly did not let anyone one of us down it was pretty insane?! shall we say. Either way a truly great piece of horror beyond what any of us had seen at the time.When i heard about This Re-make i was not so much excited but anxious to see how they would handle the story and the scenes that would be necessary to tell it to the best of it's ability.I was impressed.I knew straight away it would be reasonably mild compared to the first one it had to be , to be watchable in cinemas in order to make money. And for the most part it was. However it still kept that vital shock value the gore (the blood & guts) were handled perfectly it was like the hills have eyes re-make in the sense you saw what was happening the camera never once did one of those annoying wall shots were you see the blood splatter! when a knife went in or a bullet etc. it went in and you saw it. Well with a horror film that's half the battle straight away.Obviously you probably know this film is centred around a group of convicts who are a perfect example of a human being with no soul or heart. And this even better than the first one in my opinion is displayed amazingly. In this film you really get the feeling that these guys would do anything to any human being in the world and would not feel one bit of remorse for there actions. I would even go as far as to say out of every film i've ever watched these have to be some of the scariest people i've seen on the silver screen. It all adds to the great experience.The ""Rape"" scene/scenes are also what this film is pretty famous for and i was interested to see how they would handle this films such scenes. I thought it was handled pretty well. What this film hits straight on the head is the atmosphere the music and every aspect of the film combined just build up to exploding point then it happens. It was like nothing i'd experienced in a cinema before the place was packed out with what was to be honest a perfect testing range for the film there were people of my age (18) all the way to what i would have said was about 70-ish. As the scenes built up and up the piercing sounds of the girls screams , the actions taking place on screen and everything accumulated into one terrifying experience. I looked round the once rowdy room to find everyone silent and i could just feel it someone had to walk out.And they did.For the first time in my life a film was that shocking that as many as 10 people walked out and couldn't come back. That is what horror is meant to do!. So at this point Last House had already scored high marks with me it had stayed as true to the original as it could have. (There was also someone crying behind us!).This film splits the story 50/50.The first half is horrible it is meant to shock and appaul the audience so that when the second kicks in it satisfies all!. And god does it never before has revenge felt so right. People again were re-acting to the film again in a way i'd never seen people were clapping chants ""get in"" , ""have it"" ""go on"" and cheering. Admitadley by the younger members of the audience but non the less a great re-action. In my eyes this film was just as perfect as this re-make could have been it had it all. And it was one of the first films i'd seen in along time that was almost more than a film it was a genuine experience.Oh and you'd be surprised to know the acting was actually very well done i wouldn't have changed it at all t be honest again pleasantly surprised.Only things that this film down was the fact that it's still a pointless story and if not for the shock factor couldn't possibly be even an average film!. so I'm afraid it's a 7 from me which is still good for a horror film non the less.It's definitely one of the better horror re-makes and one everyone will have a load of fun watching what more can you ask for in this day and age!.",The Last House on the Left
160,ennieday09,"A remake that pays homage to the original and if anything, surpasses it",7,7 October 2009,"Many remakes of horror movies are dismally made and shed far from what the original was trying to present ex: (Psycho, Friday 13) or basically an Asian horror movie ever made. But Last House on the Left does something that most remakes don't and thats keep the shock factor and increase it. I was a huge fan of Wes Craven's original Last House on the Left and was iffy when I heard they were remaking this because I was worried about them ruining a classic. But that was certainly not the case in this movie.In my opinion no one plays a sadistic serial murderer better than David Hess did in the original but Garret Dillahunt pulls off a pretty good version of the cynical Krug. All of the characters personalities were changed slightly to make them more modern-day relevant and I thought that was a great change they made. Sarah Paxton plays the lead role of Mari Collingwood great and each scene of torment she is in, you can really feel the emotion and struggle her character goes through. Martha MacIsaac is also great as Mari's friend Paige who is equally tormented.The thing that I loved most about Last House on the Left is the fact each actor portrayed their character so well. Whether it was the mother and father feeling the pain and sorrow of their daughter being tortured or the killers feeling no remorse what so ever for their sick actions. Each scene keeps you on the edge of your seat and leaves you in suspense for how it will turn out. For anyone who was a fan of the first one, check this one out because this is one remake that does not destroy the original.",The Last House on the Left
161,Tralequang,Short of my expectation,6,20 April 2020,"The plot goes in a worn out path, without covering any new grounds. The below-average acting is unconvincing, with the only acceptable portion being the crying ones. The violence is boring, falling short of my expectation of incremental torturing by the parents. What's more, the characters also make some major dumb decisions.",The Last House on the Left
162,Darkweasel,Yet Another Typically Average Remake,5,24 March 2009,"WARNING: This film is about brutal rape. Not so much of the female lead but mainly of Wes Craven's original film. Well produced, packaged and acted rape, but rape nonetheless.Where to begin?KRUG: In the original he is an ugly, hulking mass of barely masked rage, bitterness and insanity. In this version he's good looking, not physically imposing whatsoever and spends most of the time using the patented Anthony Hopkins ""If you don't blink you look scary"" approach. It works some of the time but other times it just looks like he's forgotten his lines.SADIE: In Craven's film she is an out of control, explosively violent, deranged madwoman and Krug is the only person who can keep her in line. Just. She loves to degrade and humiliate her victims as much as, if not more so, than her man. However, in the remake she's basically just a lethargic crack whore who gets a bit angry once or twice.WEASEL: Now just called Frank, he's got none of the false charm and latent violence of the original character, he basically looks like a creep you wouldn't let into your house in the first place.JUNIOR: Now renamed Justin, he's the only ""bad guy"" in the film who bears any resemblance to his original counterpart. Yet the makers still manage to mess that up with a typically modern outcome for his character.The two girls are pretty much like in the original, although Mari is given a super swimming talent as an obvious plot contrivance. As sympathetic as you are to the parents' situation, they turn into cold blooded homicidal killers far too easily to have any actual resonance. Yes, they would want to hurt the people who raped and nearly killed their daughter. Of course they would. But there's a fine line between a sudden and spontaneous violent lashing out and cold-blooded, calculated and merciless revenge. As for the film itself, even though it borders on ""torture porn"" during a couple of scenes, it's still nowhere near as shocking as the original was 37 years ago. Not even close. The mental and physical torture the girls endure in the original (""P**s. Your. Pants"") takes much longer and is far worse than in this version. Sure, the rape scene is pretty damn brutal but there was far more to the original than just rape. They also completely bottle out of the best, and still most talked about, death scene featured in Craven's version.And as for the ending? I honestly don't know what they were thinking. For a film that tried to be so dark in tone, the climax is utterly (and I would assume completely unintentionally) hilarious. Simply the worst ending to a film I've seen in quite some time.",The Last House on the Left

Otherwise, it was well cast, poorly scripted, all the main characters acquitted themselves really well, the supporting characters did well also. The soundtrack was effective, the cutting OK, but whether you are a fan of the genre or not, you have to admit that this could have been SO much better. There was no humour, no visual puns, no irony, no references to other movies of the genre it just could have been so much better than it was. But it wasn't. It was dire. It was sad. It was the kind of movie that makes you not want to watch movies anymore. As someone once said 'The movies are a place where people with no imagination go to watch the bad dreams of others'. And apart from that, the flesh shots in the beginning really lower the tone to a bad excuse for soft porn. To lift an expression from that genre, this movie sucks /\ss.",The Last House on the Left
164,nunemkh,Remake beats the original.,9,18 March 2009,"It's not often that I like a remake more than it's original. But I have to say this film did an excellent job of taking the story at hand and taking it seriously. This is more than I could say about the 1972 version of THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT.This movie had a great introduction to the gang of sadistic killers known as Krug, Sadie(ironic),Justin (not junior), and Francis. After a very dread-filled scene of these killers taking their first victims - two cops- we get a less than perfect transition to Mary's character. Then the plot slowly thickens as Mary visits her friend at her job working at a convenient store in a small resort town - I know not very thick but stay with me- Mary's previously mentioned friend, Page notices a strange boy sneaking snacks into his pockets off the shelves and sarcastically confronts him. After some exchanging of words, Page and Mary drive to the boy's, Justin's, motel room to buy some weed. But after fooling around, getting high, and giving Justin a ""makeover"" the other three killers walk into the room and don't like what they see.What ensues is a just about long enough sequence of the gang tormenting, raping, and stabbing these two poor girls. However they don't die from all of it... yet.I won't give any more away but I will say that this is one of the most shocking mainstream films out there today and is NOT of the faint of heart. The violence in this movie is brutal even when it's not extremely graphic, which it sometimes is.So go watch this with your friends, as long as your friends can stomach brutality and torment.",The Last House on the Left

I'm sure Aaron Paul looks back on this choice with great embarrassment.The ending is obscene in its cynicism , blithely showing the ""good"" doctor as being no better than the ""evil"" enemy - utter garbage (note that I didn't chose the word rubbish to avoid American readers having to consult an English dictionary).Trump voters should love this.

The last house on the left. The whole concept and idea is really disturbing, suspensful, thrilling. The movie wasn´t. To me there was unnecessary gore, ridicilousness and superlong uncomfortable scenes that weren´t the main topic of the movie. It was predictable at times when you really wish it wasn´t, you would´ve wanted to have the surprise effect and it was unpredictable at times when you wish it wasn´t, because it turned really stupid really fast. By the end part of the movie I was laughing already, because it was just truly unlogical and stupid. How the mother and father acted when they found out what those people did was ridiculous. And you could argue here that everyone reacts differently to stressful and life threatening situations and that is true, but I feel like you would want to feel for the characters in the movie who are in distress. You would want to think with them, hope for their success and look forward to the outcome. With this movie, it just wasn´t there.

I saw the 1972 version and the 2009 version and I was like what in the name of god! Both of these movies were really tragic,but I just thought 2009 version was more emotional showing. 2009 shows more empathy for the characters while in the 1972 version it shows that they're treated literally like trailer trash.2009 shows better fights,better emotion,and I have to also say better soundtrack too,because 1972 really failed on that. Everything in 1972 was not right at all,and I'm talking movie wise,not story wise. Because 2009 showed something similar with different character traits. 2009 may have not been the greatest movie ever,but it still shows that the family will really try and fight for their kid. 2009 just shows more feeling that you have than 1972.",The Last House on the Left
171,japonaliya,HORRIBLE REMAKE of n American Pshcyo Classic!! READ THIS!!,1,29 October 2010,"BE WARNED, SPOILERS!!!This had a made for TV movie feel, broke no new ground from the almost 40 year old original, and if the original film could be rated 10 for horrific grossness, then this movie rated a 4!!!As said before many key elements were left out of the film and the characters (ALL) were poorly drawn, and in this version,everything that made the original unique was removed.I will list just a few examples...The bad ""gang"" in the original film were even more repulsive. The woman in the 1972 version was the mother and grandmother of two of the gang. A fat, repulsive one too. In the remake, she becomes a hot girlfriend with a mean streak, that only hints at lesbianism.Lets take the rape and murder scene....In the remake, one girl is stabbed to death quite quickly, the blond girl is raped, nothing really shown, just glimpses of panties being pushed aside, raped from behind, but no nudity. After being raped she runs away, finally after a heroic effort trying to escape. she is hit by a lucky shot and left for dead (where you find out later she isn't)Now here is the uncut 1972 version which is still burned in my brain over 30 years later.....First the young boy is forced by his dad to let one of the girls give him oral sex. His mixed expression of terror and pleasure at the same time is unforgettable..Then one of the girls (they are both partially naked by this time) is forced to give oral sex to the fat mother, and then the other girl is forced to strip her friend totally naked, and give her friend oral sex. There is full frontal nudity, and you actually see her putting her tongue in her friend's pubic area. The dark haired girl tries to run away but is finally caught, (I think in a cemetery, though here I may be wrong) but in any case is killed and her hands are cut off as souvenirs! The remaining girl is very slowly raped. Her clothes are actually taken off, she is fully nude (and this actress could not have been over 16, and NO body double) Every nuance of the rape is shown, just like a XX film (which actually this film WAS rated X in theaters) they even show her stomach with ejaculate on it after he pulls out! Then then, like in a trance, the girl walks very slowly to a pond and wades in, while the leader shoots her in the head, almost like she wants to be killed after such a demeaning ordeal.Now THAT was a rape scene!!!!Both girls die in this one.Also the end...Instead of the made for TV revenge version....When the mom and dad find out that the killers have come into their home... The mom lures the 2nd guy for a BJ and while he is about to release..she bites his pecker off, and while he screams, she stabs him with scissors.I actually forgot how the fat lady dies, but the leader's head is sawed off by the dad swinging a chainsaw.Oh earlier the young kid is forced by his dad to put the gun to his mouth and blow his brains out...which he did quite spectacularly.Esp. for its day, LHOTL (1972) was the most horrific film ever made (not inc. the actual Nazi concentration camp footage taken during the war)This remake added NOTHING to the original. The special effects weren't better, nor was the acting, the storyline, or the horror scenes...so why make it??? The only reason Wes Craven had anything to do with this pathetic film is $$$$, surely not for any artistic motivation..I don't know if the original, totally uncut version has ever been released on DVD. I saw the 1972 vs. in the theaters before censoring, and I have heard that copies purported to be uncut are still not the original full version that I saw.",The Last House on the Left
172,nascentt,Pointless and ridiculous remake.,3,14 July 2009,"To start, I am a fan of horror remakes. With movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the sequels take away B movie cheesiness and add style and suspense keeping the clever and horrifying plots.However after watching Both versions of Last House On The Left sadly it is not the case this time. The style is there, the cheesiness has gone, but also takes the horror and messes up the plot. This 2009 version tries to turn the story into a thriller, and fails. It changes the plot unnecessarily - trying to give a more happy outcome to the story, and in doing so invalidates the entire point of the ending.. Without going into spoilers actions are taken which are unjustifiable based on what hasn't taken place in this sequel.The only thing the original had going for it was the 'nothing left to lose' attitude that fuelled the ending. Also, the methods used in the ending were pretty funny and inventive, whereas in this remake it lost all originality.",The Last House on the Left
173,JeffersonCody,"Way, way softer, and far less sleazier, than the original",6,12 August 2009,"The new version of Wes Craven's 1972 exploitation classic, ""Last House on the Left"", is a way, way softer and far less sleazier film. The violence is still pretty intense, but the heroine's mom doesn't bite off anyone's penis this time round. And there's less nudity: gone is the scene (in the original) where Krug makes the girls strip and touch each other. And nobody gets their intestines removed here. Nor is the one young victim forced to urinate on herself. The big difference is in the acting quality of the new film. The cast is strong: Aaron Paul (""Breaking Bad"", ""Big Love""), Tony Goldwyn (""Ghost"", ""The Last Samurai""), ""Monica Potter (""Along Came a Spider""), Spencer Treat Clark (""Gladiator"", ""Mystic River""), ""Garret Dillahunt"" (""No Country for Old Men"") and Martha McIsaac (""Superbad""). Even Sarah Paxton proves she can genuinely act - delivering a solid, believable performance. The first half of the new film - which is very well made on a budget of about $10 to $12 million (Craven's original cost a mere $90 000) - is tense, harrowing and unpleasant as the girls are abducted and the Paxton character is raped. The rape sequence is sad, unsettling and disturbing (as it should be), but non-exploitative. The viewer experiences the victim's physical pain and emotional suffering. We see it from her point-of-view, not the scumbag rapists point-of-view. Where the film really differs from the original in tone, is in the second half. Here, when we watch the righteous revenge of the parents, we cheer on the good guys. Which is why American critic David Edelstein described the flick as a ""feelgood"" revenge film. And other critics have compared it to ""Taken"". In the original film, the vengeance aspect was not shown as a solution. You felt icky and troubled by the carnage when the movie was over. Still, this is a pretty good remake. A (relatively)low budget film that delivers in a big way. Initially it was going to be released direct to DVD in the States, but after preview audiences responded positively, the picture went out on the big screen. And grossed around $35 million at the US box-office. It's actually worth seeing. The new film is more of a revenge thriller than a horror flick, and I wouldn't describe it as an exploitation flick.",The Last House on the Left
174,Stefanowich,Remake of remake that fails to deliver horror,2,5 September 2009,"The original Last House on the Left was a remake of Ingmar Bergmans Jungfrukällan and it shocked audiences worldwide with it's raw and brutal violence. It wasn't, however, a pretty good movie. The Last House on the Left 2009, the remake of the remake, is even worse. It's actually one of the worst remakes ever made. The original story and villains have all been replaced by a new bunch without any depth of character at all. Also, the violence has been Hollywood-stylized and is not the least bit shocking or, in fact, even disturbing. Where the ""original remake"" shocked, the ""remake of the remake"" fails (and I watched the UNRATED Blu-ray edition). The violence in The Last House on the Left 2009 is just pale, boring and stylized. Simply put, guns ain't scary in films so why use them in a horror movie at all? Hollywood has lost it's grip on the horror genre and been surpassed by Europe, and then especially the French. If you want a good horror movie check out the original versions (NOT dubbed versions!) of À l'intérieur and Haute tension - that's horror that'll shock! Also, check out British The Descent which scares like few other movies out there. As far as The Last House on the Left 2009 goes, it's a waste of time to even watch this piece of crap. Last thing; why, why, why can't Hollywood a) skip the ""super-kids"" and b) let dead people stay dead in horror movies? Horror? Nah! This is a TV-movie, nothing else.

175,Jbrown0170,HBCU247.com,7,19 March 2009,"Masters of horror Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham revisit their landmark film that launched Craven's directing career and influenced decades of horror films to follow: The Last House on the Left (1972). Bringing one of the most notorious thrillers of all time to a new generation, they produce the story that explores how far two ordinary people will go to exact revenge on the sociopaths who harmed their child. The movie started out with a WTH, it gave you break, then came back to finish with a WTF. Sounds like it was it was quick movie? Well, it certainly seemed that way. The crazed-sociopath Krug (who also played the slow-talking', country deputy from No Country for Old Men) played sadistic very well; however, I just could not appreciate the manner in which they chose revenge for him. The movie had me saying Wow, and OMG, while kind of laughing at a few scenes (although I don't think they were intended to be humorous)like you would smoke some weed with a complete stranger.

176,tacmovies,Straw Dogs meets Taken,7,14 March 2009,"I'm amazed at just how much they were able to get away with in the explicit department. It's not really a horror film, more of a revenge thriller. I also think that the movie failed to transfer guilt to the audience, which it was clearly trying to do in the early parts of this movie with the extreme chest close ups and nearly up-skirt shots of Sara Paxton. This should have created desires in the audience which would be met with a certain feeling of guilt during the sexual assault scenes. However, the villains were so evil and over the top that I don't think anyone felt enough empathy for these characters to think that they may have wished the assaults into existence. So, I guess I'm saying that if Iliadis wanted to make a movie that forces the audience to question the evil inside themselves, then the teases should have stayed in the movie, but since the movie turned around the idea of these villains being the worst kind of evil imaginable, the kind that need to be executed rather than arrested, then the audience should not empathize with them, making the teases inappropriate for the movie.On the subject of super evil villains, you have to respect/fear movies that do such a good job of making the audience hate a character that when that villain meets an over the top, gruesome, painful demise, the audience cheers, as happened in the theater I was in. I hate to godwin here, but this is how you brainwash people into doing the Führer's bidding.

178,DeadeGuard98,"An Escape, A House and The Encounters",9,2 June 2020,"😱 First Impressions:
I had some reservation when it came to this film- for maybe years, because of the plot summary (terrified me very much and I watched a lot of horror movies). I also had a preview of its contents in the parental guidance section which is why I sort of knew what to expect. I finally watched it; exactly everything I pictured it to be and I was right in it being a brutal hour and a half.
Pros:
😋 The insanely off-putting plot but at the same time, satisfying conclusion (more than I should have been). It's every parent's fear when it comes to their daughters or son (no judgement). There is a persistent theme of parenthood here in how the crook wants to mold himself within his son and that's frightening to me.😋 Everyone was brilliantly cast! The villains, menacing and threatening. The protagonists were really likeable despite being the usual teens with a penchant for mischief. Though initially helpless, they all had a lot of fight left in them.😋 About 80% of the film is intense and blood-pumping. It was genuinely terrifying as it all appears overwhelmingly hopeless. That is until you see the film has only reached the halfway point, before things start to look up but could still go either way.Cons:
😪 Just thinking out loud- but it would have been much more mind blowing if the parents weren't shown or introduced until after Mary assaulted. Then, the wanted criminals show up at a complete strangers' house only to be revealed as the parents of the girl they presumed to be left for dead. Because with how the film actually played out- as soon as the two parties met and we know who each of them were, it was only a matter of time as we all know it's coming.😪 One more thing, I get the whole ""do unto them"" but the morality is seriously questioned here and thrown entirely out the window. Daughter gets assaulted and shot but survives. Parents go on a rampage and murders all three crooks... It's quite the payback but then who is actually the bad guy(s) then? This is all very much hypothetical as the gang obviously would have killed them one way or another but we'll never know could we?😇Verdict😈
The Last House to The Left is a very plausible and scarring viewing experience for just about anyone but families especially. What the film does and shows to the audience can only be an assault to the senses! Despite being a remake of a much earlier work, it made enough changes to be a solid, bloodcurdling thriller.",The Last House on the Left

Tugs at the heart strings sometimes and makes you feel really angry for most of it.A little bit overboard in terms of detail at times.
The 'torture and rape' of the girls seemed to go on for so long it was genuinely uncomfortable to watch! I felt it went too far, nobody needs to see that on a film in such a matter of fact way, could have done with toning down a bit really.
I'm no prude. But it was just unneeded.Also the acting wasn't amazing either.
Some were good and some not so much. A bit hit and miss. Aaron Paul is always easy on the eye though.Liked the overall revenge part in the second half of the film though, that was very satisfying!A few twists and turns along the way too.Wasn't fantastic, but wasn't the worst film I've seen.
So worth a watch!Oh and also....the last bit with the microwave???

Much more realistic than the 'Saw' or 'Hostel' movies which relied too much on planning and much less on impulsive decisions and opportunity which makes up 90% of all crime. The two girls ended up in an unfamiliar motel, and one decides to ring her parents to let them know she will stay over, if you can accept this, then you will have a shock seeing how events unfold and go from bad to worse. The rape is inevitable, then killing, these things happen in life somewhere everyday, its not fun to watch, but very realistic. The attempted escapes have you on the edge of your seat although in real life they would be bound. Overall a very tense film which keeps you thinking, What would you do if you were the parents? As a just revenge for raping and almost killing a young woman who has to live with this for the rest of her life, the main protagonist was let off with an unfair quick death. The paralysis incisions in place of duck tape was brilliant, but to then spoil it by treating his head like a ready meal left you feeling empty.

Many would put labels on a movie like this saying ""it's about the evil of men"" or ""how strong a woman can be"". Well do yourself a favor and forget all that garbage.This is a movie about pure evil setting itself upon the innocent. It's about facing your worst nightmare and discovering the strength buried within yourself. Standing up and choosing to live when everything inside you wants to give up and die. Above all, it's about how far a parent will go to protect and shelter their child in it's darkest hour and seek justice for that child by any means necessary. If you can see that after watching this movie then you can see why a movie like this was made. Everything in the film is designed to drive you to the edge of rage and then allow you to release it as true evil comes face to face with people who just won't back down. The acting is top notch, the setting is perfect. It's well scripted and directed and regardless of which version you watch (cut or unrated) the ending is fantastic. I recommend this movie without hesitation but I will add a warning though.

186,ninjas-r-cool,"No heart, no soul, no guts, no edge... and no Hess.",3,28 October 2009,"As a general rule, I don't bother with any of the recent glut of remakes. To me, showing any attention whatsoever to this trend is to show one's support or interest for Hollywood's current disregard for originality and its shameful disrespect towards classic films, particularly of the horror genre. But the Last House on the Left remake was just too tempting to miss. Even attempting to recreate a fraction of the grim, dirty feel of the original is an audacious goal in itself. That coupled with the fact that many were saying that it actually succeeds as a quality rape-revenge film piqued my interest. So it's a shame really that the film is rubbish.It actually starts off quite well. If there's one thing that grated about the original LHOTL it was those damn comic relief cops that kept popping up and destroying the mood. The remake assures us that this won't happen a second time by quite gleefully murdering a couple of wise-cracking cops in the very first scene. The message is clear: There'll be no joking around this time, kids. Sadly, this isn't the case, and even more sadly the opening scene is one of the few redeeming moments in the entire film. Yep, it's mostly downhill from here on in.The main criminal decision made with this film is it chooses to have such thoroughly dull cardboard cut-outs for the villains. I don't care that the two girls were basically personality-free, and I'm not fussed that the parents were ridiculous clichés, but at least give us some suitably slimy villains to despise. The character of Krug in particular is just awful. Garret Dillahunt is a decent actor, but he simply doesn't have the sheer hulking, brutish physical presence of the mighty afro'd one, so he should have been given some decent dialogue or something to help make the character his own. No such luck though. In fact, there's not a single line in the entire film that is particularly interesting.Surprisingly, the highlight of the entire movie is the rape scene itself. Sure it has its problems. There are far too many shots of hands, trees and dirt rather than focusing on the nitty-gritty (I sincerely hope they don't choose this route for the upcoming I Spit remake - 30 minutes of foliage might become tiresome). Plus, although he's balls deep in a 17 year old, Krug appears to be having as much fun as if he were having a tattoo sandpapered from his penis. But overall, it's fairly nasty stuff and nicely creates that disgusted feeling in your gut that one hopes for from a rape scene.However, the wackiness so far avoided by eliminating the comedy cops kicks in strongly during the revenge portion. Any realism created by the first half of the film is immediately quashed by the over-the-top hijinks and unintentional hilarity that follows. With all the ludicrous character transformations and the people casually being thrown across rooms and through balsa wood furniture, I couldn't help but laugh, and not in a good way. The infamous microwave scene merely serves as an unfunny punchline for what has become one big, long joke.Basically, this film removes or changes almost everything that made the original such a gritty, gruelling classic. It's an exploitation film with no actual exploitation. Worst of all, in allowing Mari to survive, it removes every speck of gravitas that the final moments of the original had, replacing it with sickening audience-friendly schmaltz.What's that you say? I should view it on its own individual merits and not compare it to the original? Yeah, maybe. And maybe the producers of this travesty shouldn't have called it 'Last House on the Left'. Because it sure as hell isn't.",The Last House on the Left

189,SilensMortea,Made me rethink my pre-formed opinion,9,11 July 2010,"I have seen the original ""Last house on the left"", drawn in by the tagline ""To avoid fainting, keep repeating ""It's only a movie...It's only a movie..."". I thought to myself any movie that needs to remind you it's only a movie must be brutal and horrific and memorable. I'm sure that when the movie came out it was shocking, but to my desensitized brain it was boring. Nothing was shocking or extreme, the story sucked, the effects sucked, and there was far too much sex (as is the case for many movies nowadays). When I heard they were remaking it, and everyone was excited, I was quick to give my two cents about how awful the original was, and how dirty and blah this new one was surely going to be. On Yahoo Answers, many people were asking questions about the storyline, which I happily gave away in great detail, to the anger and disgust of others. You just have no idea how upset I was at how lame the original movie was, as I has searched long and hard for a copy! I had no hope for this one.Then came the day we were walking around in the video store, with no options. I spotted the remake and decided for $1, I may as well try it. At least it would give me something else to make fun of. I was wrong.Almost instantly I was pulled into the movie. The blood are gore were amazing and brutal. The nudity and sex was almost non-existent (Aside from the rape scene, which to me wasn't nearly as bad as most people make it out to be...and I have personally been raped). The acting was amazing! I thought the parents did an excellent job acting scared, unsure, angry, vengeful. The criminals changed from being the hunters to becoming the hunted. I was thoroughly annoyed at the main character's friend, but I didn't have to worry about her for too long. This is the only movie I can think of where I wanted to the bad guys to lose. I was extremely surprised by this film, and it made me eat my words, for sure! Next time I'll be sure to watch a movie remake before judging it so harshly; it would have been a shame to have missed out on this masterpiece. It is so incredibly hard to find a good movie with lots of gore and cringe worthy moments that isn't bogged down by sex and bad acting.",The Last House on the Left

All the actors were excellent because this way the movie became realistic.

When I first seen the previews for the remake, I knew that it would be good. I was 100% right. This movie is good because it actually makes you have strong feelings about the characters. The overall tone of the movie is very depressing, but thats what makes this movie good. The rape scene is very hard to watch. Every time I watch this movie, I have to continue to turn away from this scene. But this scene is done very well. There's no nudity present in this scene. The emotional level of this scene is very strong though.All in all, I think this is the best remake ever made. It was very intense and raw. The acting and directing was spectacular. No other movie has ever gotten to me as much as this. But thats what horror should do. It should make you get depressed and scared. Horror has been lacking this ability for quite some time now. I don't recommend this for young viewers though. Although I'm young myself, I still think it should only be scene by older viewers.

There were points in the movie when it was 2 vs. 1 or 3 vs 1 and the majority would be getting their asses whooped. At one point a character was able to knock the gun out of the other character's hand using a pillow (possibly a bag). When the mother was presented with ample opportunity to ready herself to effectively knock out one of the bad guys, she resorted to using a wine bottle (??). Of course, as the characters are running away from their assailants they take a tumble just as they're about to be clear of the horror to only be dragged back in to it, classic horror movie idiocy.

193,Neil_Durrant,A horror film strangely cathartic.,8,5 June 2009,"Most classic horror films have a big black, monolithic slab of horror that lasts nearly their entire length. This nearly always includes ridiculous incompetence from the ""goodies"", a seeming omnipotence on the part of the ""baddies"" (whether supernaturally endowed or not), and that merciless, terrifying violence that we secretly love to see, while ostensibly rooting for the vulnerable flowers as they're smashed against things and stabbed.This film has all of these things in the first half, but mercifully seems to have minimised the more irritating aspects of horror. It's almost as if the makers, crazy though this sounds, actually put some thought into what might be running through viewer's minds, rather than just doing the same things that everyone else does.Then, joy of joys, the film starts to become quite a pleasure to watch. It's not a jarring change, and it's not just because things go nicely (they don't, to be honest). No, it's because plausibility, a thing so rare in shockers down the ages, steps in and rescues The Last House on the Left from mediocrity. Recommended.",The Last House on the Left

195,raimi3,The Middle of the Road Remake Streak Continues...,6,9 March 2009,"The remake of Last House is neither great or horrible. In my opinion, it sits comfortably in the middle somewhere. I preface by saying that I am not a huge fan of the 1972 Wes Craven film, even though I consider myself a fan of his other works. Much like the remake of Amityville Horror, a remake of this film could not do much worse as far as I'm concerned. So I wasn't planning on having too many complaints relating to the differences with original source material (and since I haven't seen the Bergman film, by original I mean the '72 film). I wasn't expecting much, and I was given more than I expected. The story remains very similar in that two girls find themselves in an unfortunate situation buying the dreaded weed! One of the girls, our heroine Mari, is a good virginal, family girl. The other, is a little more daring and promiscuous. The original developed this relationship better and seemed to look closer at the characters personalities. To me, this made the next set of events more effective.While buying the drugs, the girls and their suitor are interrupted by the remaining members of the suitor's gang, who have recently done something illegal and are running from the law. In mere moments, the girls find themselves the prisoners of the gang for fear of alarming the authorities, or maybe because the gang is sexually attracted to the girls and has other uses for them. By any means, the gang and the girls take to the road to escape. While en route, Mari sees that they are traveling near her house, and tries to make an escape which results in the crash of the car they're riding in and some injuries to the passengers. Her attempt ultimately fails and she and her friend are punished for it. This is where the original and remake separate a little. The original featured a much more sadistic turn of events, where as the remake lets us as the audience off a little easy. The only cruel and disturbing element that the remake was able to recreate in my opinion was the Uber spoilerbrutal rape of Mari by the gang's leader. To me this scene was very unsettling and was the only part of the film to capture how evil the gang of criminals are, save for the opening scene where they force a dying police officer to bleed to death on a picture of his kids, all the while telling him that he'll never see them again. Back to Mari: after she is assaulted, Mari makes another attempt to escape. She runs to the lake to swim away from her captors and although she manages to dodge the majority of the bullets that they fire at her from the shore, one gets her in the back and she is left for dead in the water. Here is another example of how the original differs. In the original, there is no doubt that Mari is shot dead. The remake leaves open the possibility that she was merely injured and thus sets up a more uplifting ending. Because the escape attempt rendered the gang's transportation useless, they approach a nearby residence for aid. In an ironic twist of fate, the residence is that of Mari's parents who have no knowledge of the unfortunate events that have just unfolded. Here the film settles into it's third act, where the parents discover the deeds of the gang and carry out their revenge on them. The remake has Mari arrive back home barely alive, where her parents are able to save her and ultimately leave with her, along with the unfortunate son of the gang's leader who helped the parents exact their revenge.The attacks on the gang by the parents in both films felt over the top to me, and this is really where I move away emotionally. It seems that in both cases, the violence is only present to appease the audience. I feel that if the attacks would have been more organic to the parents plight, they would have been much more cruel and disturbing instead of satisfying. Take for example the brutal attack on the assumed rapist at the beginning of the film ""Irreversible"". This is the kind of violence that I think would have benefited the overall feel of the Last House remake. Instead we are treated to an odd ""head in the broken microwave"" sequence that is never properly explained. Oh well, if the majority of the audiences are anything like my screening, this film will get a pretty good reaction. At least on the first viewing anyway. However, this is one film that will definitely not stand the test of time. But, neither does the original, so who cares.5/10",The Last House on the Left

201,dumontaaron55-1,Meh,5,23 November 2009,"Well, it isn't much a daring or truly exciting spin on the horror genre--at first sight, in fact, I might remind one much more of a kind of plastic, glamorous update of 'I Spit on Your Grave' (or, more obviously, Wes Craven's 1972 'Last House on the Left'); you know, the type of dull, bloody deranged female revenge fantasy masquerading as something deeper and steeped more into feminism and politics--but in its heart beneath its foggy atmosphere and unsettlingly perfect, ship shape tone (intentionally or unintentionally, though?) there is small little patches of real, genuine rigour, mystery and, most importantly, vision. Regarding the murder of one girl and near-one of another (and the family's encounter with and revenge on the band of killers that had done this), the movie should be praised for its unsentimental, primal and exquisitely physical portrait of two parents' disgust and rage over finding their beautiful girl, raped, tortured and horrifically wounded, lying cold in the rain--and not to mention the realization that the people who had done this were inside their house, while being warmly and kindly served and sheltered by them--the movie teeters between a foggy blossoming of dread and a murky, mucky sense of nastiness and exploitation of dread--and speaking of exploitation, how's about that last scene in the film? That moment--where (SPOILER ALERT) the parents paralyse the last sadistic killer standing and, in a gory, up-close shot, puts his head in a microwave and...well, I think you understand the following scenes. It's difficult to tell whether it was a loving homage to exploitation cinema or simply pure exploitation on its own. Either way, it's either a poor smirk or simply a bad stumble into torture porn.

206,ajh193,Better than I expected,8,21 March 2009,"Overall, the movie was actually pretty good; it greatly surpassed the original. The acting was excellent and the parents' reactions were much more realistic--particularly when they find out that their daughter was raped. Specfically, the last 45 minutes of the movie were extremely climactic and intense. The parents were very smart and typically the people act retarded in a scary movie; or you wonder, ""Why the hell did she just do that? She could have gone the other way or done something else!"" That didn't happen in this movie...at least not more than once. The way the father and mother killed the characters was mind numbing. For anyone who enjoys suspense, this movie is for you.Problems with the movie: 1) I find it EXTREMELY difficult to believe that Mari was shot in the back while swimming, lie underwater for God knows how many hours, and yet was able to survive and stagger back to her parents house like 5 miles away. I like that the daughter survives, but they should have made it different (maybe she should have been shot in the arm or something...not the back)2) Why wouldn't Paige SHUT UP?! If someone holds a gun AND knife to your head and says ""not one word"" you would be smart to NOT say anything. Oh no...not Paige. She felt the need to keep talking and PROVOKING them to kill her. In addition, it was pretty much her fault that Mari was raped. She should have kept her mouth shut. 3) Adding on to #2, I'm glad that Paige gets killed. She was pretty much asking for it the entire movie. If a strange boy comes up to you wearing a hooded sweatshirt over him, telling you to smoke pot, what kid in their sober mind would INVITE the kid into their car, drive back to his conveniently ABANDONED motel, and start smoking weed?

208,TodayIsTheDayOurSinsWillBeOver,A welcome remade version,7,28 September 2010,"My review for this film WILL contain spoilers and possible spoilers for the original version of the film. I'd highly suggest if you plan to see the movies for the first time, please discontinue reading until after you have watched them. Now onto my review, enjoy! I've previously said in my other reviews on various titles, I don't normally like remakes because they're normally never nearly as good as the original. Seems to be that this situation is improving as yet another classic horror film gets the remake treatment, and this time is actually quite well made and acted. I've seen both the original and remake versions, but for the purposes of the review I'm just going to review this remake and leave it there. This remake closely follows the original with the storyline and content. For those who have not seen it, or heard of the original Last House on the Left, I shall fill you in before I tell you my thoughts on the movie. In my opinion, watching either version will suffice to see the story as it's told.The Last House on the Left tells the story of Mari and Paige and their uneventful downfall into the hands of a criminal gang who have escaped from a prison transfer. The criminal gang is wanted for rape, murder, and pedophilia. Mari and Paige are just two normal young adult women, they seem friendly, jokey, and well just two nice girls which makes the events to follow even more disturbing. I'm not implying that if they were ""bad"" it should have happened to them, but simply expressing that they seemed two easy-going girls who just wanted to have fun. Anyway, Mari meets up with Paige after driving with her family's car to go spend the night at her friend's house. Things soon turn bad though when they meet up with this young kid called Justin (at the store Paige works at) who invites them back to his apartment not expecting to see his criminal father, Krug, turn up again when he has the two young women at his apartment. This is where things go downhill for these two girls, as they meet up with a gang of murderers and rapists - one of whom is actually a young sadistic woman called Sadie who takes pleasure in seeing sadistic torture.Much like the original Last House on the Left, the scenes of torture and sexual violence are hard to stomach. I couldn't help but feel great sadness & pity for these two young girls as they were assaulted and beat up and just humiliated. The rape scene in particular is pretty disturbing, and left me with a feeling of disgust and sorrow for the mayhem on-screen. The emotional feeling of the rape scene for the victim was intense, it just makes you feel helpless as you can only sit there and watch it. It's like they treat these young women as if they were not living human beings, and just dispose of them as soon as they became ""useless"" to them. Combined with the fact they were two easy-going young girls, it makes even more the horrifying. Thankfully though, one of the girls supposedly survives her ordeal and revenge is served to the thugs that humiliated and killed one of them. I was happy to see the revenge scenes in this movie, because they most certainly deserved it. The movie easily succeeds in making you want to see the bad guys get their own back on them. It was also nice to see one of the young girls getting help by her family and being taken to care. The young kid Justin did not partake in any of the violence or humiliation of these girls, and was more or less just a puppet for Krug and his gang who abused Justin with violence and the use of drugs.The original Last House on the Left had pretty much the same emotional impact on me when I first watched it. The villains in this remake do just as good at portraying their characters as the original did. I was surprised they found someone who could portray Krug nearly as well as Hess's performance in the original version. But they did, and he did the portrayal as a bad guy very well indeed. This remake most certainly draws about evens with the original, if not better. It's well acted, realistic, and makes you feel disgust at the bad guys like it should do.I think the main reasons for me saying the remake is better is the fact that there is actually a somewhat satisfactory ending to this film with the bad guys all getting what they deserve and one of the young victims surviving the ordeal. It made me feel that little bit of happiness to see this poor girl finally get help and reunited with her family. The original had a more darker ending with really no happy ending for the victims as none of them survived.Needless to say, Last House on the Left is grim, and I've given it a 7 because of the more upbeat ending and how well it has been remade in comparison to other remakes out there. Probably not a movie you want to sit with your family to watch but more of a movie you'll want to watch alone. The violence in it is not pretty folks but none the less I felt compelled to watch it to the very end to see what I'd hope to see.If you haven't seen the original and just watched this version, I'd pretty much say you don't have to check out the original as this remake is more than enough for the story to be told. Horror buffs will have probably checked out both versions. Think whatever you want here, but my opinion is, this remake is slightly better than the original.Good day!",The Last House on the Left

Those people complaining I'm guessing hadn't seen the original and realized that the sleaze factor had been toned down. Yes, there is a psychologically draining rape scene, but they cut back on the hour of endless sexual abuse in Craven's original (plus some of the less PC killings at the end.) Now, that said, this version is different from the original, which, to me, is good. I own the original, and if i want to see it I'll watch it again. Sadi was a little less sensitive to the girls-- which, good or bad, is at least different. Krug is more of a hillbilly in this than a street thug. And it increasing became better because the methods of taking revenge on these animals made the film.I gave it a 7, exactly what I'd give the original-- which basically was nearly ruined by bumbling bad actors as cops and cheesy music (I wish Wes would edit some of that out.)",The Last House on the Left
211,aiga,Not scary but attention grabbing.,8,2 November 2009,"So, apparently this movie is a remake. I didn't know that. I do watch a lot of movies – different kind. I know some things about the movies, but I don't know everything. This is one of the cases when my knowledge failed me. I am intrigued though. I would like to see the original as well. I hear it is more horrifying than this one. I must admit, I didn't find this movie scary at all, but don't get me wrong, it doesn't mean that the movie is bad. Though to me it does not qualify as a horror movie, it has its moments of great suspense. It is more like a thriller when you just find yourself holding your breath and grabbing the holds of your seat in anticipation. If you want something that will hold your attention for about two hours, this is the way to go! I must point out the most exciting part of the story. It is the fact that there is no black or white in this movie. It is just grey. I am referring to the moral side of it. Well, of course, there are the bad guys and the good guys, but in the course of the movie their places as good or bad sort of get swapped. At the end I almost felt sorry for the villains Well, almost. I found myself cheering for the dad / good doctor on a killing spree to avenge his daughter, but at the same time I wandered about this wild side that is there in each of us.

Here we have an insight into the protection and care of a father for his daughter as well as what a mother will do if someone touches her child with evil intent.

But then I realized that this remake of the 1972 original is a very bad movie. Two girls come to Justin's motel room to smoke pot; at that time, his ""family"" arrives and becomes violently suspicious. They put the girls under captivity, move out into the closest forest, get lost, etc, etc.... Paige was able to escape from ""the camp"" and later was brutally murdered for that. Her friend was raped, tried to escape, but was shot in the lake. The criminals, then, could not go any further: their car was broken, they were tired, and one guy was injured. So, they stay overnight at a married couple's summer house. They are the parents of the second girl. She, apparently, survived and was able to make it to the house, where her dad takes care of her. The parents realized that the people who stopped at their guest house are those criminals who tried to kill their daughter. This is there the movie becomes even more ridiculous. The parents murder brutally all criminals. The murders are horrible, even much more brutal that do not go into any comparison with brutality of the real criminals. The parents are now criminals and the bad guys are now victims. I'm giving this movie 1 out of 10 because I still cannot believe in amount of blood and brutality carried by the parents. Just watch the THEATRICAL VERSION until very end, because daughter's dad proves that he has some criminal history, perhaps. Do not watch the Unrated Version: you might need psychiatric help after that. I didn't watch Unrated version, but the theatrical one is more than enough for me to grade this horrible movie.",The Last House on the Left

As far as remakes go, this one actually held my attention and was very well made. It was clearly more 'Hollywood' and less raw & gritty compared to the original as most remakes usually are but as a stand-alone film, it was a compelling and gripping watch.

221,thatsarappp,"Get all your breathing in during the first half hour, cause after that you wont have a second to catch your breath.",9,12 January 2010,"I've seen a lot of films in my day. I worked my way through the entire horror section at my local video store as a kid, and not too many films get inside my head or have a profound impact on me (while I'm watching or afterward) anymore. The Last House on the Left certainly did. Prior to finally seeing this incredible film, I nearly bought it several times, even going as far as to have it in my hand only to put it back in favor of something else. As you can imagine, what discouraged me all those times was the numerous reviews I had read about how awful it was. I believe one of Entertainment Weekly's writers even gave it an ""F"". The only ""F"" I'd ever seen dished out in the magazine. But for as many negative reviews there were, I saw just as many praising the film. Enough was enough, I paid the $19.99 for it. It was worth every penny....Lets be clear, first off...This film is not for everyone. And I fully understand the ""love it or hate it"" pattern that has emerged. It's extremely rough to watch at times, and made me- a horror junkie from the time I was about 9 years old- quite uncomfortable at times. For some this is a bad thing, and indeed what would inspire the negative reviews. For others, like myself, this is exactly what I am searching for. If you're like me, ignore the negative reviews, as they are undoubtedly primarily coming from those who are not looking for what you are.Another thing to consider is, there is a rape scene. If you've seen another remake of a Craven film by the name of The Hills Have Eyes (my all time favorite horror film), and had trouble watching that one, stay away from this one. I assure you, it is worse than that of THHE. No need to contribute to the undeserving bad reviews if you know from the get-go that you're only going to detest what you see. The scene was a tad difficult for me to watch even (especially with my girlfriend watching as well), and did seem to drag a little longer than I would have hoped. That being said, it only added to the mounting tension and general discomfort of the film. And because of that, I cannot honestly speak negatively about it.The most important thing I can tell you about TLHOTL without spoiling anything is it has intensity that is matched by few horror films that I've seen. Like the title to my review suggests, I was hard-pressed to find a moment in which I could catch my breath. I was fully swallowed up by the film's tense and nerve-wracking atmosphere, and that is something I experience very infrequently. Very little, if any of this atmosphere was created by cheap scares and ""make you jump"" moments. Purely psychological, and due in large part to the absolutely brilliant acting of Aaron Paul (as usual) and Monica Potter, whose nervous looks, expressions and mannerisms literally blew my mind.I can also say in all honesty that there are no blatant typical ""WTF is he/she doing??"" moments you tend to see in horror films. Unrealistic acts of utter stupidity that ruin the mood and quite possibly even the film itself. There were no half-hearted chuckles coming from me during those 114 minutes. This is easily one of my top 10 favorite horror films of all time, and I'm still debating with myself as to whether it is worthy of an overall top 20 spot, which it may claim yet.In regards to the original, I have not seen it, so I have nothing to offer as far as a comparison. However, you can be sure I plan to see it now.Outstanding. 9/10",The Last House on the Left

225,hokiefilm,"Better than the original, but far from perfect.",7,13 March 2009,"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of the original movie. I'm going to first list the positive aspects of this remake and end with the weak aspects.What I Like:1. The gore, and, yes, the rape scene. I've noticed in a few reviews that some movie-goers feel the gore is too much, and that the rape scenes are just too brutal. To this I say: are you kidding?? I understand that people have qualms with pointless gore. I'm sure we all saw the new Friday the 13th--everyone knows that that's just gore for the sake of gore; it's pure entertainment. Here, however, I feel that the brutal reality of the rape scene is a necessity. Take, for example, the original film. The gang in the original is much more ""sick"" and ""twisted"" than this gang. They make Phyllis soil herself; they make the two girls have sex with each other; Krug carves his name into Mari's chest. This is great detail, but we don't see any of it; it's all just implied violence. In this movie, the violence is less, but we see it, so it makes a heavier impact on us. I refuse to accept the notion that I must be a sociopath for appreciating the intensity of the rape scene (as I read in one review). 2. (BIG SPOILER): Mari survives and Paige dies. While I dislike the Slasher-movie-like implication that if you enjoy smoking a joint, you'll be the first one dead (aka Paige), I was very pleased that Mari survived. It takes away any doubt in the parents' minds that the gang attacked their daughter. That's something that always rubbed me the wrong way in the originalit was wholly unrealistic that the mother saw the generic peace necklace and just knew that it was her daughter's, and thus felt the need to search the suitcase, saw blood, went to the lake, and found her dead daughter. I mean, that's stretch after stretch. I like the remake better. Mari comes back and confirms their fears. Not to mention the fact that it makes the plot more interesting. These people did not kill their daughter; they attacked her. The mother and father are torn between survival and revenge--the audience is left wondering, to an extent, which is the biggest motivator in the situation. Is it fear or vengeance? This creates a very, very interesting dynamic. Whereas, in the original, the parents are in no danger (they go back into the house after finding the body when they easily could have run to a neighbor's or gotten in a car and driven to the police station). 3. Teamwork. Something that I disliked about the original film was the lack of cooperation between husband and wife. I don't like how, in the original, the husband has the mission of taking out the leader, while the wife defeats the sidekicks with a) trickery and b) cat-fight skills. It prevents the interesting teamwork dynamic--a dynamic that is hugely realized by the new movie. Husband and wife work together to create some amazing death scenes. Not to mention the fact that the wife doesn't just get stuck fighting the woman and seducing the horny sidekick- -she gets in on some very real killing action, which is amazing. The teamwork between the two really makes the second half of the movie, in my opinion.Some smaller likes: Paige's death scene was very well shot and well acted (kudos to Becca from ""Superbad""); there is no ""Home Alone""-esquire montage where the dad sets up booby traps throughout the house--give me a break; Francis's death scene is absolutely fantastic.What could have been better:1. The backstory. The family had a son/brother, Ben, who died. We hear about this repeatedly, and yet it holds no weight in the plot at all. I think this fact could have been used as a means of exemplifying grief and numbness to death (which, I think, they try at in how brave and somewhat numb Mari is to the whole ""I'm kidnapped"" scenario, but I don't think it's used to its full potential).3. The end. BIG SPOILER. Now, this is the most important for me. I feel as though the most interesting part of this film is its ambiguity as far as motive goes. I was wondering, throughout the entire second half, what the motive was--were the parents simply ensuring their own survival and acting out of fear as they searched for the boat keys that would allow their daughter to get to a hospital? Or were they acting more out of anger and the desire for revenge? Was it a combination? Which was more important to the characters? This begs an interesting question concerning humanity--which takes precedence: instinct and fear or anger and revenge? I was fascinated by and ready to praise this theme woven excellently into the plot... until the last minute. Why on earth would the husband come back to finish off the leader of the gang?? That just annhialates any question in our minds as to what the true motive was. It takes the characters out of the moment--there's no adrenaline, only calculating cruelty. The husband comes back and takes the time to paralyze the guy, and then decides to blow his head up in a microwave. This is a horrible, horrible ending (and the main reason I took off 3 stars). The movie should have ended a) with the excellent shots of each dead body or b) with the shot of the survivors on the boat. Either of these two options would have been great (I prefer a, but lots of people like closure, in which case b would probably be better). However, the head in the microwave ending? Garbage.Overall, there were more good changes to this remake than there were bad additions. Hope this review was enjoyable :)",The Last House on the Left
226,drummerboyy123,is it better than the original??,9,14 March 2009,"in a way, yes. The remake is a very unsettling movie. I actually feel bad for the characters, only the good ones. The movie centers around Mari and Paige going to buy weed, and it takes a horrific turn from there. I personally found the rape scene to be very disturbing and hard to sit through. The acting overall is OK, but the best acting is from the parents, and Paige and Mari. The parents are very believable and you feel bad for them when they find Mari. The first half of the movie is very upsetting and sad. And what makes this even more upsetting is that this happens almost every day to young girls. The second half of the movie, you're just rooting for the parents to kill and torture the gang, all in exception for the young one Justin. You actually pull for him to live. Id say it is better than the original, much more brutal. Definitely a must see. 9/10",The Last House on the Left

What a sad time it is when the typical suspense techniques are so overused and a rape is so used to create emotions in the viewer of this movie. It is as though the producers and director are specifically targeting people to feel hate and justified revenge from the hate that comes from the rape scene. Not only that but the viewer has to sit through multiple, as mentioned, cliché suspense scenes that are since Friday 13th, utterly not worth any money or time.

232,ThornIs,Again I Seem to be Alone on this One,4,1 November 2009,"OK, I admit I may be a little predisposed to be against this movie for 2 reasons. I love the Virgin Spring, and I am a fan of grainy original, which could make you over critical. Also this movie does seem to be made for a different generation of movie goers. So I might not ""get it"" so to say. But I must admit I had 3 problems with this movie that prevented me from enjoying it. 1) The Casting. Not that anyone is a bad actor or does a bad job, in fact they are probably the best actors to take on the roles. (Im even considering the Virgin Spring as well) My problem is, that one of the great things about the two preceding movies is that the characters looked realistic. The daughter, her friend, the parents, and the killers all looked like real people. The parents didn't look like they must have had kids in their teens. It made the whole experience of those two films more authentic. 2) Polish. Simple, this one is polished the original wasn't. I was expecting that when I started watching it, and thought I wouldn't mind, after all it was a modern film. But literally from the second scene I began to miss the grainy, realistic look of the original. I think it was the lack of polish that made the first Last House On The Left so unforgettable. Love it or hate it there where images from the original that would stick with you for a while, ie the girl in the pond. It was these images that would come to mind when you would talk about old movies with your horror buff friends and Last House On The Left came up. What images do I remember a day after watching this version? Nothing. 3) The Point. The previous two, love or hate them, where timely. They reflected the different morays of the time - fears of the break down of society or, with the Virgin Spring, the loss of faith. This one does give the audience what they want, which is gore, revenge, some action, etc., but beyond that there's not much there. And for me I just kept wanting something to be there. In other words it felt very shallow, though this is a feeling I have been getting from almost all Hollywood films for a long time. Hey maybe the movie is a reflection of our time, but I'm almost sure that is unintentional, and kind of sad. The original is still out there, and so is the Virgin Spring, so is the Swedish poem which the Virgin Spring was based on. I'm not against retelling a story, but it seems with every retelling more and more substance is being removed.I usually hate to compare a movie to it's original content, and try not to, but being familiar with the content I just couldn't help it.Watching this one did make me want to watch the 70's version again.

233,eric-1268,Avoid at all cost,1,18 August 2009,"Man, this movie was so extremely bad, I don't know where to begin. Because the limit of 1000 words I can't make a full description of how bad this movie is. Here are a few points:1. The way Paige reacts on the weed, do all Americans go brainless after 2 hits of weed?2. The girls don't do sh*t when they see a police-car passing by, but when they're in the middle of the woods (where NOBODY is) they suddenly try to escape. 3. Paige, one of the two kidnapped girls, manages to escape. With two homicidal guys behind her, she tries to get the attention of some construction worker who's two miles in front of her (sitting in a car) by SCREAMING to him. While she's standing still. 4. When the homicidal couple gets back, Mari & Krug are sitting like 12ft away from each other. Why does Mari wait for the homicidal couple to come back, while she can just try to run away? To get raped, and after being raped, to (FINALLY) escape? Now she can run for three trigger-happy maniacs. I guess she was just waiting for some more cock to arrive.5. The first fighting scene with the mother/father is really pathetic. Instead of sticking some knives in the back of this guy Giles, they try to drown him and put his fingers in the grinder. They're in the KITCHEN for crying out loud.6. Not to talk about the other fighting scenes. It's pathetic. Why don't they kill Krug in the last fight? No, instead they give him one bash on the head and then step in the boat.7. Well, probably the most laughable is the microwave head explosion. I didn't know your head explodes after +/- 15 seconds when you stick it in an open microwave.8. And OK, finally, IF the doctor wants to kill the guy, why don't pump some air into his veins? Or just suffocate him? But no, instead he chooses to stick the guy his head in a microwave, so his head can explode. I guess he wasn't thinking that he has to clean up the head-splash-blood-brain-parts after wards.This movie was so wrong in so many levels, the scriptwriter obviously stuck his own head in a microwave before filming this piece of trash.

And the final scene in the remake (spoiler) where the father lays the villain on a table and puts the killers head in an open microwave and the explodes the head was absolutely ludicrous. For a good revenge remake, watch ""I Spit On Your Grave"".",The Last House on the Left
236,macblackslair,A savage and brutal thriller slightly suffering from weak storytelling,5,8 September 2012,"Wes Craven produced this remake of the original ""The Last House on the Left"" from 1972, which turns out not to be a typical horror flick but rather a quite gruesome psychological thriller. Introducing the characters in the beginning did not really work for me although I have to admit that I enjoyed the performances of both Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter as Mari's parents. In fact, the pace of the first twenty minutes or so is too slow and the movie seems to suffer slightly from weak storytelling. When the two girls Mari and Paige are kidnapped, suspense and pace increase and the atmosphere gets darker with every minute. The scenes in which the girls are abused and tortured take too much time on screen and I felt paralyzed and uneasy watching it - honestly, that was not necessary, at least in my humble opinion. What could have been gripping is nothing but cruel and sadistic.I am also disappointed about the final scenes which are supposed to bring relief to the audience. I did not feel this relief and was still troubled with what I had seen.Still, the performances were quite okay, the music was absolutely fine, and I also liked the setting. Directing was also good, especially regarding the camera work. Since I have not so much as ever glimpsed at Craven's original, I am not able to compare anything. I assume I might enjoy the 1972 version more, considering its slapstick elements and its obviously more convincing characters.",The Last House on the Left
237,KJacob73,Doesn't Disappoint! A Great Shared Catharsis with an Audience!,7,13 March 2009,"Craven's 1972, Last House on the Left is a deplorable act of low budget film-making that should be seen by all cineastes. The audacity of its nihilism hasn't lost its edge. The appeal of its cheapness is how it brings out the brutality of what happens on screen. It's close to watching a snuff film during the first half. The haunting ballads by David Hess, who also plays the leader of the rapists/killers really add an emotional heft to the rape and murder of virgin Lucy. I'll never forget how she walks away with that song echoing, ""And now you're all alone..."". The final half isn't as powerful, but still packs quite a catharsis for the audience wanting to see these sadist gets tortured by everyday suburban Americans.I saw Iliadis' version and was stunned out how effective it was. The story itself remains pretty much unchanged. Style wise it's as far away from the grimy Craven version as you can get. Which for in 2009 works for the young audience I saw it with. I can tell you that many of them didn't know what they were getting into. Unlike some other remakes like Halloween, Last House On the Left isn't a know commodity. Clearly the audience wasn't expecting to see acts of rape and silent brutality without the help of blaring music. When the knives penetrate you feel them. In that way it works like Craven's film. Iliadis doesn't tone things down though the wonderful cinematography makes things a little prettier, which doesn't mean less pretty.Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn play the parents with conviction to elevate the material. They become the focal point during the last half of the film, which loses some of the nail biting tension of the first half. Still it seemed extremely cathartic for the audience to see the parents carry out their brutal revenge. This is an audience film by all means, unlike I believe the original, which still has the power to haunt you in your home and in your dreams. If anything that's the major difference. The new version, while better than most remakes, is a visceral experience with an audience. Afterwards it kind of fades from memory. It lacks the complicated sociopathic performance by the handsome David Hess of the original. Still I'm glad this remake was made, it really gets under your skin and almost brings you back to the Wes Craven I used to love.Special note should be given to Sara Paxton, a teen Reese Witherspoon, she really earns the sympathy of the audience. It's rare in a Times Square audience that a nice rich white girl isn't called a ""stupid bitch"". Paxton manages to pull off the right amount of vulnerability and smarts to let the audience root for her. Spencer Treat Clark, who plays the sons of the lead psychopath, is also very good and gets the audience to care about him as well. Come to think about this horror film works more than most due to the audience actually caring about what happens to these young victims on the screen.",The Last House on the Left
238,freakinflax,Good remake that kept it's cruel nature,7,13 March 2009,"As a fan of the original 1972 version, I wasn't expecting a lot, but at the same time, with Wes being brought in as a producer, I felt it had to live up to some expectations.What I got was a fun yet torturous movie that had the audience with it the whole time. They were gasping, hollering, sighing, saddened, and later clapping, laughing and woo'ing. It really takes you for a ride from the first moment and only lets up briefly, only to take you back down again.While the original scores higher for ""shock factor,"" this one still has plenty of gore and story. I'm not going to give anything away because I'm sure most of you know the story by the trailers, but overall this is an intense film that you won't forget anytime soon. If you know what happens, you'll be happy when the second half of the film picks up. If you have no idea, try to enjoy the ride as I'm sure you'll leave satisfied.A few people in my theater left before it ended, so if you feel sick or faintful, just keep repeating to yourself: it's only a movie, it's only a movie, it's only a movie...",The Last House on the Left

The acting was sharp, the plot devices made just enough sense that it never broke my disbelief and I admittedly had to briefly look away from some scenes.The setup was stellar and the ending did not disappoint.

243,anspruchsvoiier,"Stunning, silent, loud, emotional and...",9,30 June 2009,"...rewarding!!! Oh how rewarding this movie is! I like horror films, but I really hate stupid ones with predictable plots, shallow characters and those which have cliché written all over them. Now, this is true for may be 90 to 95% of movies of this genre, which makes it pretty hard to find the good stuff, that isn't just another boring teeny slasher. Well, look no more, because you have found one fine movie with ""The last house on the left"".I just read on IMDb that this is a remake of a great horror movie, so I watched this version without any bias. Usually, I'm not a big fan of remakes, but thanks to this movie, I'll check out the original, too.I don't want to spoil the plot, so let's just say that this movie doesn't go the path of the ""let's decimate a group of annoying teens""-movies. It's rather one of those ""the-right-people-being-at-the-wrong-location-at-the-wrong-time""-kind of movie and this really pays out. The storyline is realistic and even more important: believable. Of course, some of the characters still border on clichés, but this is excusable, because this is balanced out by other ""normal"" characters.The acting is pretty good most of the times. Especially noteworthy are the performances of Monika Potter and Tony Goldwyn (they played the parents). I haven't seen Goldwyn since ""Ghost"", but his side stroll through the TV-series market sure didn't hurt his acting. He portrays a believable father figure, whom you automatically sympathize with. Monika Potter's performance of the terrified, yet angry mother is just as excellent.Some people argued that this is no horror movie and therefore a fail. It sure is more of a thriller, but that doesn't make it any less of a great film. Gore is being kept to a minimum, which adds to the realistic nature. Still, you get to see some nice and unusual scenes.Even though there's a lot of action going on, the pacing always seems slow. This is due to quite long scenes, which stretch the agony of the characters to unusual lengths most of the time. This is actually a nice way to make a film. It's certainly better than killing the characters quickly and adding tons of fillers, which is the basic concept of, in my opinion, inferior horror movies.Another thing that struck me was the flow of the movie, if you could call it that. While there are some strong emotional scenes, the movie doesn't know (or want) to emotionalize until the end. May be that's just my feeling here. At the end I didn't feel bad, but I certainly didn't feel as relieved as in ""Taken"". But don't get me wrong! I liked this feeling. This made the movie stand out for me.At the end, the movie will be rewarding in one way or the other. It surely is more rewarding than most movies of that genre out there: If you hated ""Eden Lake"" because of its ending (or like me, just in general, because it is such a god awful movie), then you will most certainly like this one.",The Last House on the Left
244,ge-ranma,Simply put...,2,29 March 2009,"Simply put...****ing awful. Almost everything that a good horror film is in my mind has been perfectly contrasted in this 'Last House' remake. First off, honestly, the movie is just downright boring. It starts you out with very little, something mildly grizzly. And then takes way too long, that's the flat and boring story chugging along, to get to anything else entertaining. What probably bothered me the most was how they threw in some really cheap (and poorly portrayed) shock value material to make up for the lack of well plotted suspense. I referred to it as a ""mock-devil's rejects moment"". And then the gore was so sparingly used, so badly built up to, that when it DID happen, it's let-down factor was roughly 10x more disappointing than socks for your birthday. While Last House wasn't entirely devoid of a single good moment. It was close enough. I can't fathom how it gets 7.1 here. (at time of my review) I give it a 2, and it gives me a dunce cap for wasting $20 to spend an hour and a half trying to stay awake.",The Last House on the Left
245,subase,Self reflective and surprising - A nice horror film,7,27 March 2010,"Audiences are very familiar with the revenge film and torture porn. 'The last house on the left' is conscious of this knowledge and it being a horror film that is a member of the club. But rises above it's roots and offers real insights into violence and its consequences, even if admittedly few audiences members will get the message.It does this with it's play of violence. Frighteningly realistic, gratuitous, over dramatic and then finally fun. Each scene is understood and enjoyed for what it is. The films closing scene questions whether we have really learned anything after all? Insights over the threat of death, pain and violence against the body is technically speaking a fruitless enterprise.Illiades opinion, that films can only offers so much but you can try anyway, simultaneously reveals a hope in humanity and almost a disgust with the cinematic medium as form of communication. This may be why his title project is a coming of age story of two girls and their friendship in the world of teen prostitution. A man's ignorance on all counts cannot be stressed enough, yet Illiades continues to search and look at what is so divorced from his experience.""A little understanding is better than none"" is his motto. And so 'House on left' is full of cinematic skill to get it's perceived understanding of phenomena. My suspicion of what rape really is, are here supported by Illiades camera. In many ways Illiades work is straightforward and even in spite of its subject matter feels very familiar, Illiades doesn't appear to be teaching us anything new so much as reminding us of what we already know. In this sense he is a moralist, appealing to our better natures.This is shown in the various responses to the violence we see on screen. Instead of accepting each scene for what they are, in a horror remake film no less. Audiences and reviewers instead take a moral stand on a specific depiction of violence on the screen. They say it's cartooned, yet they enjoy boxing, action movies and wrestling. They say it's too realistic when they applaud the realism of violence in moral war movies. Too gratuitous they say when the enjoy advances in film gore. The 'house on the left' aims to appeal to every taste for cinematic violence, yet it is the audiences moral stand and ignorance of reality, that makes them reject and approve of only certain forms of violence on screen. The last scene of the film points fun at and affirms this narrow view of the audience.Illiades direction is fine, certainly superior to ever horror film in recent memory. But it suffers from its analysis and tonally different views of violence. In many way's its 4 or 5 tonally different films in one. The influence of the writers, Craven and the original film is also unclear. But he is a sure hand under the directors seat, bringing great performances from his actors and some visually dynamic scenes, perhaps in the future he will attempt something more sustained in tone and will achieve something less schizophrenic, more affecting and ultimately less forgettable in large part.It is unclear whether Craven knew what he was getting himself into when he hired Illiades or if Illiades has managed to pull the rug under Craven's whole career, while at the same time not devaluing it in any way. Something tells me Craven would approve of this sleight of hand. Whether Illiades has more cards up his sleeve in his subsequent films (I haven't seen his debut 'Hardcore'), is yet to be seen.",The Last House on the Left
246,mellvsej,"Decent horror, quite chilling",6,2 August 2009,"The movie as a whole was quite good, but a bit overdone. I felt like the most interesting character was Paige, but she of course was the first one to die. It didn't even feel like this movie was really a remake of the 1972 version because: a. the plot line was completely changed (there was no dead brother in the original, Justin (or Junior) was not as good of a person in the original, and a lot more obvious one that you will have to watch to find out. b. The revenge the parents take on Krug and his gang is completely different than in the original. I have to say that I was disappointed that the mother didn't castrate the guy in this one. I kept waiting for it to happen, since she was pretending to come on to him. c. The parents weren't snobby enough! In the original, the parents looked down on Paige's character because she was poor, but in this one they had no problem with her.All in all, I would tell any horror fan to at least rent this one. I gave it a 6 just because it frustrated and scared me at the same time. There is a lot of controversy over the microwave scene, but I felt that part was quite good. I loved the hand in the garbage disposal as well. Classic! The rape scene, for me, seemed out of place and unnecessary. Krug had Sadie, so the only reason I can see for him to rape Mari would be because it was a power thing. He wanted her to know that he held the power throughout the situation. The film would have been a lot better without this scene, but then I probably would have complained more about how different it was from the original.

""Last House on the Left"" (2009) is only in a remake in the basic story. Other than that it diverges a lot. The main problem I have is that it is devoid of all humor. The Wes Craven movie was funny and horror mix. That is part of what made it disturbing. This one is too straight horror. There are no slapstick elements. That is too bad because you need it in this kind of rape story to lighten things. The much talked about rape scene is not overdone, thankfully. There are no crazy camera shots, but it is still much less disturbing than the first rape scene which was more brutal. Also, I won't give it away but the end was kind of a let down.

253,chazmuse,A disappointment and NOT a horror.,5,11 May 2010,"A let down. I'm going to review this as a film by itself, not a re-make.Firstly, the film has been labelled as a 'horror' by many different sources. Horror? Not so sure. Granted, there are some highly graphic scenes and scenes of sexual violence but it's not a horror. Not once did I feel like it was. It's a violent thriller, nothing more.The story... nothing special. It does what every horror does. It attempts to throw in a few twists and turns to keep it fresh and original but they don't succeed, in my opinion. They're not bad, but that's all I can say about the film as its greatest compliment. 'Not bad.' The direction was a disappointment also, it failed to deliver on a level I'd remember days after having seen it. So many times were shots beautifully set up to go somewhere special and then just didn't. One as an example, when the camera moves towards the cracks between the wooden panels of the boathouse. It fails to do what we're all waiting for... to go through the cracks to the other side. What it does do... is stop, and then go around the side. If you've seen the film, that example will make sense. I hope! I thought the characters and the casting efforts were average, aside from the best friend character of Paige. Couldn't stand her. The typical outgoing, overly-confident horror 'girly-girl' who then falls into the screamer category once the knives begin to surface. Mary, (the main protagonist) on the other hand was fantastic. Great young actress, good solid character.And to close, the ending. What a disappointment. The ending made clear how little Justin's character was unneeded really in the film. Or certainly not made use of enough. And the microwave, what a pathetic finish. I'm not going to dwell on the ending, it just wasn't worth talking about.All in all, watchable the first time around, a disappointment having done so and not something I will remember or ever venture to watch again.",The Last House on the Left
254,AlwaysVanilla,The Best Horror Movie This Year!,10,13 March 2009,"Usually with horror movies, I'm disappointed. The plot would be bad, it would be rated R for too much unneeded nudity, the gore would be over the top, and the acting would be bad. For this movie, it's the opposite.The beginning starts off with a boy in the backseat of a police car, when a car crash happens. The boy's friends save him and kill the two policemen.When a 17 year old girl named Mary goes to her parent's lakehouse, she wants to go meet up with a friend in the town. A boy walks in underage wanting a pack of cigarrettes, he offers the girl working there, which is Mary's friend Paige, that if she will let him have them he will let her go back with him and do drugs. They go to his motel, and unfortunately, his deranged 'gang' comes back when they are there, and worried about their secret getting out, they decide to kill the girls, and will do anything in their power to.The plot was good, the storyline was realistic, the acting was terrific, the suspense was amazing, no nudity overload, the gore was added at the appropriate times, and it kept you on the edge of your seat. There was some disturbing scenes in this movie, and I would only recommend it for die-hard horror movie fans over the age of 14. There are some disturbing images that are not meant for eyes under 14.The only thing I would change about this movie would be the ending, but overall I think that this movie has very much more pros than cons.

As a viewer I was disturbed by the needless violence depicted in the last third of the film.

256,nightair86,Base Depravity is not Horror,1,27 July 2010,"Whatever happened to scary horror films? I mean films that actually make you feel afraid as opposed to films that sicken you with their depravity. For me, scary horror films are ones like the originals of psycho, alien, the exorcist and poltergeist. These were truly scary, clever pieces of art that thrilled us with the director's ability to scare the bejesus out of us through plot, script, music, acting and special effects. True masterpieces of the genre.The Hills Have Eyes, (and its predecessor and successor versions) and the other depraved films like Last House on the Left (both versions) rely on rank perversion and unnecessary depravity to achieve their ""shock value"". They are not, in my opinion, scary or fear-inspiring; they are simply depraved to the sickest degree.Have movie makers lost the ability to be creatively scary in their art? Must every 'horror"" film that is made now have to include young, virginal girls being repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted in the most perverted fashions? Raped by escaped psychopaths and mutants, new mothers having their lactating breasts suckled upon, girls being forced to have sex with each other by their captors, female soldiers being penetrated from behind by hulking mutant monsters,.... it goes on and on.If you want a movie that explores the ""horror"" of rape, then I recommend you view The Accused from 1988 with Jodie Foster as the lead. It is a moving film which shocks its viewer without relying on the excessive perversion that is so typical of the Hills Have Eyes style of film. One wonders what ""new"" depravities will be created by modern horror film makers. Perhaps now the psychopaths and mutants will employ their pets and animals to ravish the young maidens who are presented for violation.And, just in case you still harbour illusions that these scenes are anything but sexual exploitation, have you noticed that all the victims are attractive females?",The Last House on the Left

260,eddiemad,Slick remake without the edge of the original,6,12 June 2009,"There are certain remakes you just know are going to have their work cut out for them from the outset. Someone decides to remake John Carpenter's The Fog, it's not that big a deal. Someone decides to remake Psycho (and stick to Hitchcock's shooting script shot for shot), that's just asking for trouble. So if you're going to have a crack at Wes Craven's notorious debut feature 'Last House On The Left' then you must know you're taking a huge chance no matter how good it looks or how well the actors perform. Let's face it, the early 70's original was certainly rough and ready with some dodgy acting, terrible light relief moments (those two bumbling cops on the chicken truck) and a completely at odds musical soundtrack courtesy of David 'Krug' Hess (not including the hauntingly brilliant 'Road Leads To Nowhere' song). Director Iliadis corrects all of these 'faults' in the remake with some top notch acting, sinister soundtrack, excellent visuals and not a bumbling cop in sight (thank god). Unfortunately he also tones down the more excessive moments of the Craven original meaning the remake never hits the same disturbing level achieved back in 1972. Some may well be grateful for this. It's bad enough that two girls have to be raped and murdered without having to see them being mutilated and degraded to the extent they were in the original movie. And Iliadis offers up a fair bit of hope that Mari Collingwood might well survive this time round. But this ultimately ends up diluting the whole experience. The first half of the remake is strangely uninvolving, despite Krug being portrayed as an out and out sicko from the outset. Anyone familiar with the Ingmar Bergman inspired story will coast through the first hour or so as there really isn't anything new on show. It's only when the Collingwood's realise they might well be harbouring their daughters murderers under their own roof that things finally start to get interesting and the Death Wish mentality creeps in. Suddenly the film comes alive for half an hour or so and the audience is fully behind mum and dad, urging them on to give these lowlifes what they deserve. And get it they do. But no matter how polished and well acted the 2009 version looks it still can't match the power and nastiness of the 70's original. Anyone who's seen that might well be bemoaning the lack of the (briefly seen) disembowelment, chest carving, penis severing, hand lopping, forced urination, and, most famously of all, the dream inspired hammer and chisel to the front teeth (because of the low 70's budget most of this happened off screen but boy, did it pack a punch). Above and beyond this even, there was a general sickness to the 70's characters and the way they behaved that doesn't really come across here. Sure the class of 2009 consists of an evil bunch of thugs you hope you'd never have to meet in real life. But 35 years on they're not really that different to any other bunch of cinematic sickos doing the rounds. It's only when the Collingwood's fight back that the film comes to life. Back in 1972 Krug and co commanded attention from the moment David Hess popped that kids balloon with his cigar in the opening five minutes. For those unfamiliar with the Wes Craven original this remake is nasty and 'real' enough to make an impact. But for the fans it's only half successful. Not a disaster then, but certainly not a patch on the original despite the more polished approach.",The Last House on the Left

The Italian movie is considered one of the cruelest movie ever, so according to me this one looks like the kid version of the franchise... Just compare the 2 rape scenes! Also the story is terribly predictable.... the last 30 minutes pure trash! ... Once in a while Italy defeat Hollywood 62 62!",The Last House on the Left
262,vampireken,A rare type of film. One that makes you proud of the characters.,10,14 March 2009,When I first heard of the original Last House on the left I figured It was a haunted house movie until I saw the trailer for the remake. I have never seen the original but I went and saw the remake on opening night. The theater was full. The beginning is kinda upsetting because you know whats going to happen to the girls and they seem so happy. This film is interesting on how it is made. In the beginning you see these criminals brutally killing two detectives. Then every chance the girls get to escape it is ruined by the criminals. This makes you hate the criminals more and more. After they rape Mari and then shoot her and leave her for dead the hate grows and you just want everyone of them (except the kid) to die. The first part of the film makes the audience get so filled with hatred while the second part makes you let it out. whenever one of the criminals got killed the audience cheered and started clapping. The tension in the film is perfectly placed. Such as the motel scene when you know the criminals are going to walk in the door at any minute. Mari struggling to make it back to the house. The characters make you proud when they kill every criminal. A perfect remake.,The Last House on the Left

Here we have on display in the first 15 minutes of the movie a couple of very DUMB soon to be bimbo type teenagers who with all their self proclaimed intelligence put themselves at risk with total stranger, who takes them to a sleezy motel to buy/use Mary Jo. AND instead of just making the purchase they sit around in the sleezy motel with the stranger and use the MARY JO! Call me stupid, but hey, I lost all sympathy with these two clowns for the rest of the show. I sat through the rest of the movie to see the parents react to a horrible situation.

When I first saw it advertised, I thought it would just be another film that they show the best parts in the commercials, and then leave the rest of the rubbish for you to pay and go see! But this film delivers right from the outset! Yes, their is some parts where you are shouting at the TV for the girls to run away from their captures, and you just want to pick them up and carry them off so they don't get anymore hurt for being so stupid! But on the whole it is fantastic! The acting is spectacular from Sara Paxton who has to be 'raped', shot, attacked and the rest and she does it just brilliantly.The storyline is very solid, and has you gripped all the way through from start to end!

265,jaw-5791,A genuinely terrifying tale,7,9 July 2009,"The film for me did extremely well – especially after considering it was released closely with other horror films such as 'Drag me to Hell', 'The Uninvited' and 'The Orphan' Last House on the Left stars Sara Paxton (a seventeen year-old rape victim), and her parents played by Monica Potter (the anxious mother) and Tony Goldwyn (a doctor) – all of which do a fantastic job of portraying a grieving family.Put in a position where the life of their daughter is at further risk, both parents go through a violent ordeal to get their daughter to safety. What I really liked about the film was that it did absolutely everything to portray the reality of rape. Although very explicit, it did not attempt to glamorise it in anyway, instead it left me tense, still and frightened.Last House on the Left – does great for Horror and Suspense! It starts of quite expectedly, and soon molds in to something a little less typical to what I'd usually expect from a remake. Although Paxton did great, Monica and Tony did an excellent job of displaying anger, hatred and desperation that comes with the notion of parenthood.Overall the film is genuinely terrifying – I give it a generous 7/10 for a great narrative, challenging visuals, and great (genuine) depiction of characters.",The Last House on the Left
266,pranshumba,Probably the most HARD-HITTING Movie Ever!,8,30 July 2009,"Its rare that you come across movies that leave an impact even hours after you watch them . ""The last house on the Left(TLHOTL)"" falls under this category. There are not many movies whose remake is miles ahead of its original counter-part. My head was filled with the brutal scenes from the movie until I went to sleep. I enjoyed 'Dawn Of the Dead' more than the original and so did TLHOTL. The way the director builds up atmospheric tension in this movie right from the beginning till the last scene-its really incredible and a treat to watch. TLHOTL is a revenge thriller and remains true to its genre & is better than most of its counterparts- in terms of look, thrill,entertainment value,acting,direction-everything just falls in its right place. The only drawback of this movie is that its not meant for audience below the age of 18(at least I don't recommend it). When I finished watching it, my 13 year old bro(who is a big movie buff like me) asked if he could watch it-I told him the same thing. The way the rape scene and the scenes thereafter were handled-its too terrifying and hard-hitting for young audience. Watch this movie if you like tense atmospheric,suspenseful thrillers like SAW,DEATH SENTENCE,MISERY etc- it will be going to take you to a different world altogether. You will be so engrossed that you will forget watz happening around you. I give it a solid 8/10 for its flawlessness. GO FOR IT!",The Last House on the Left

269,AbysmalRayne,"Enjoyable, but sickening",8,27 October 2012,"I really enjoyed this film. I thought it was gritty and sent a chill through me multiple times. This is what I look for in a thriller. The only thing I did not like about this movie was they took the rape scene too far. I feel that showing the rape at all is 100% unnecessary. They could have gotten the same effect without the visual. In my opinion, if the director has to show the rape to get the audience to feel the intensity of the scene, he/she is not doing his/her job well. A good director doesn't need the visual to create drama or tension, a good director could've done the same thing without showing the rape at all but rather showing the reactions of the people watching the rape. Furthermore, I think that no person should want/need to watch a rape scene to feel the tension that it creates. Personally, I couldn't watch the rape scene. As soon as I realized they were going to show the rape, I immediately left the room and literally tried not to puke. To watch a person get raped is gruesome and is just too real, no one needs to see that. The rape scene was the ONLY thing that stopped me from buying this one after renting it.",The Last House on the Left

But I just have to talk about the scene when the dad is taking care of his daughter. This man is a highly skilled surgeon and you just see him automatically getting into that mode as he works to save his baby girl. I actually cried as he spoke tenderly to her and worked expertly to stabilize her while his heart is absolutely breaking. His hands didn't shake once; he was in perfect control. And I completely broke down when he discovered that his daughter had been raped. Even after that realization, he had a quick moment of grief and anger then expertly got back to work, again comforting his daughter with a gentle, reassuring tone as he undoubtedly did when she was little and fell off her bike, etc. I fell hard for this character from that scene on. And I cried even harder when he broke the news of the rape to his wife--incredible acting in this scene.This movie was amazingly well done--though it's been haunting me all day (just saw it this morning for the first time.)

Throughout this movie I found myself shouting at the screen and asking myself why they are so stupid. Mari ignores like five opportunities to run away, John leaves his home unlocked knowing that four rapists/murderers are fifty feet away, and Emma misses like 10 opportunities to kill Frank. Also, John somehow manages to screw up shooting at two people lying asleep in bed five feet away. I can't think of one smart decision made by any of the protagonists (hey! We're two hot young girls, let's smoke pot with this Unabomber kid we just met ten seconds ago and hang out in his shitty motel room where no one knows where we are!)I really hate these ""thriller"" movies where the people we're supposed to be cheering for have no survival instinct, and would probably have died from stupidity long before any serial murderers found them.",The Last House on the Left
274,bowmankcmo,Surprisingly suspenseful,8,23 July 2009,"I was really in the mood for a good scary movie the other night, but I felt like I'd seen everything already, and I'd seen so many stinkers, especially of the remake or ""reimagined"" variety, that I wasn't even going to bother with this one. But I was pretty desperate so I gave it a shot. When you go into something with few or no expectations, you can really be pleasantly surprised, as I was with this movie.I'd seen the original ""Last House on the Left"" ages ago, was suitably freaked-out by it, and figured the remake would just be an even more gruesome, B-movie equivalent, and that the tragic events which befall the main actress would be even more exploitative. In other words, I thought they'd go for the same grossout shockfest that movies like the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" series' had to stoop to, in lieu of actual suspense-building and dread.Instead, this turned out to be a movie that could actually stand up on the acting, direction and cinematography alone, without excessive gore or silliness. Oh, there's gore, but it's handled quite realistically, and therefore is even more shocking than seeing gallons of blood gushing out everywhere.It's pretty suspenseful, too, especially, I would imagine, if you had never seen the original or knew the premise.I don't post a lot of these, usually only if a movie really surprises me in a good or bad way, and this one qualifies as a good surprise. This is a very decent scary movie if you're in the mood for one.",The Last House on the Left
275,buffywillowchris,"Fantastic Thriller, Well Acted with Unbearable Suspense.",8,15 June 2009,"What I took into Last House 09 was what I knew about the original (by the way i have the original movie on DVD and it has been sitting there unwatched for a few years), and I must admit it's definitely a quality movie, great acting, wrought tension and great scares, i must say there were times I was hiding behind my hands because it was so suspenseful.It is also beautifully shot and looks amazing, Dennis Iliadis direction is superb and he gets every bit of energy and emotion from all of his cast. The actors are also really well cast, Garett Dillahunt is truly frightening as the movie's main bad guy, Riki Lindholme portrays Sadie with true evil and is very very creepy, Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn both pull off the typical family putting on a brave face (considering the back story which i'll not spoil for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet), that are put in a position where they have to do what they can to protect their daughter's life and their own. Sara Paxton and Martha MacIsaac also show that they are capable of a more dramatic element than just a comedy and teen movie fare, that we are used to seeing them in.The only thing I hated about the movie was the rape scene, the build up was just so intense that I found myself covering my ears so I couldn't hear what was going on, but apart from that go see this movie if you want to see how a remake should be done.A thought provoking, pulse racing thriller, that will have you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.",The Last House on the Left

Absolutely terrible, horribly offensive, and unnecessary trash, possibly the most irritating scene I've seen in any movie. Maybe it's because this was the unrated version i watched. It didn't need to be so offensive to be shocking, and i guarantee the rating of this movie (6.8 currently) would be at least a 7.3 had it not been for that scene. I hope others agree, if not, that's really effed up. The rest of the movie after that for me was wasted potential.

281,jonpaddol,thejonnyFILM.com reviews Last House On The Left,8,15 March 2009,"well after seeing it: Last night Man On The Street and I traveled into, what seemed like, the depths of hell. And I don't mean ""hell"" like sitting through a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie, I mean ""hell"" like making you want to crawl out of your skin in every possible way that a good thriller should make you feel.Because I've wronged you on almost every recommendation I've made lately, I feel obligated to let you know that if you have an untold tolerance for general inhumanity, The Last House On The Left is a must see.first things first, the movie is NOT a horror movie. it's a thriller. there's no bogey men. no curses. no weirdness. just terrible people doing terrible things to innocent victims in harrowing drawn out scenes that range from no-big-deal drug use to am-i-somehow-an- accomplice rape. the film was far from perfect: there's a dead-brother plot that never really comes full circle and the final scene, while AMAZINGLY satisfying, feels a little bit out of place. But if director Dennis Iliadis was setting out to create an entertaining (?) film that would make you want to die half way through (there were double-digit amounts of people who walked out of the theater we were in.) then he succeeded with flying colors.The scariest thing about this movie to me is the fact that director Iliadis has only one other credit to his name. that movie is called Hardcore. so just to be clear there was a script that he felt better deserved the title ""Hardcore"" then a film about an innocent family who has no choice but to savagely murder the cop killing rapists who left their daughter for dead. and after looking at the trailer for Hardcore....",The Last House on the Left
282,monkeymagic93,Great film and an even better plot,7,17 December 2010,"I was flicking through the channels on my local television station and found this movie playing. At the time i was sitting next to a 12-year- old and quickly found out that it was not suitable for her, thus turning it off to save her trauma. I was disappointed as it really intrigued me, but sure enough, i found it on at a later time. It began slow, building the story line and revealing how the characters would play a part in this great film. I was unaware at the time it was a remake and therefore my judgements are being passed with a ""its a new thing"" feel to it.This film begins with a loving family on a loving vacation to an old family holiday spot. Mari is the daughter of John and his wife Emma collingwood. When they reluctantly agree to let their daughter visit an old friend, the film takes a dark sinister twist. I wont reveal how, or why, but Mari's friend is murdered in a confrontation like no other. It was one of the most brutal, raw pieces of acting i have ever come across. I found it hard to digest and watch, but i pulled through. Mari escape's and with a bullet wound on her back. the killers thought she had bled out in the water, and seek refuge in a home with two loving parents. A doctor, and a worried mother. The story continues to develop as Mari returns, and thus sending her parents into the ultimate act of protection and revenge. This movie has great acting right through and is a great film. not for the light hearted but is a very solid film, with many highs! i give this film 3.9/5 Stars",The Last House on the Left
283,spazmo14,"great new ideas, visually beautiful, could have worked on the script a bit more",9,16 March 2009,"I have seen the original, and although it was cheaply made, there are still scenes that stick with me, years after viewing it for the first time. Seeing the original also left me eager months beforehand to see the remake. So, yes, I went into the theater expecting a lot, and was let down and quite pleased with the outcome at the same time. From the first few seconds I knew the score would be stunning and the cinematography would certainly catch my eye. The things that I liked:1) I loved the new dynamics of the gang. I loved Dillahunt's portrayal of Krug. SPOILER: There are several moments in the movie when his character's conflict is palpable; while sleeping in the guest house he spoons with his girlfriend(something you don't automatically assume a killer would do), but is the first to jump out the window and not fight for her. Also, his relationship with his son(played by an excellent Spencer Treat Clark) is a threshold of I love you/I love you not, especially at the climax. Their relationship, in my opinion, could have been a whole different movie.2) I liked Mari's parents dynamic. There were small moments between the two of them, after dinner, just before the gang shows up, for example, that speak volumes about what they've gone through as a family. I think it was rather obvious that they lost a lot of intimacy and teamwork after the death of their son, Ben(which I think, as a subplot, could have been handled better). SPOILER: Their teamwork returns when they have to mend their daughter and decide, word for word ""How far they are willing to go"". 3) How far they are willing to go, indeed. This is a major factor in a revenge movie. If the killers attack the parents themselves, it is a question of survival. If they attack the killers, what line have they crossed? From the amount of cheering in my theater, I don't think they crossed any line that wouldn't have been crossed by any given audience member, if Mari had been their daughter. The gore was cringe-inducing, but so was the rape scene, so they balanced each other out.4) I don't think I can say I ""liked"" the rape scene. The scene was horrendous, sharp, and personal. I thought the scene in the original was a heck of a lot more disturbing, and certainly more cruel. In comparison, I thought the remake worked better because the criminals are, of course, psychotic, but in my opinion all of the villains in this remake were slightly more ""human"". They crossed a line, of course, and deserved what they got, but there was no carving of skin and disemboweling like the original, which to me, crossed a way worse line. What really, really took away the magic was the dialogue. There were a few moments in the movie where what the characters said to each other was so mundane or was an example of terrible acting that it took me out of the movie with a cringe. Overall, I liked this version much better than the original in a number of ways. The ending of the remake is out of place, but highly anticipated. I would recommend seeing this in theater if you're a fan of the genre, because if nothing else it will give you something to talk about. The movie is certainly all I've been thinking about for the past 24 hours.7/10",The Last House on the Left

287,SAChiasson,"This is a truly evil film, in more ways than I can describe",1,10 July 2009,"A long time ago, when I was a mere lad, I made the mistake of watching the original ""The Last House on the Left."" God knows where my parents were at the time, for had they been there, they surely would've turned off the TV, for this was a movie which disturbed me for quite some time.The violence in the movie didn't bother me too much. I'm of the generation who understands that when Jason hacks up the idiotic college-aged kids at Crystal Lake (most of whom, if female, for some reason were always naked and taking a shower), I viscerally understood that it was what I term ""Schlock Shock.""To wit, the blood was just corn syrup and red dye, the naked girl in the shower was just a one-shot wanna-be actress who blew the casting director for her 15 minutes of fame, and that even though Jason came back countless times in the sequels, he was just a mythological Bogeyman, right?But the rape scene in ""The Last House on the Left"" deeply disturbed me.The callous disregard for the intimacy of sex, and how the violation of this intimacy was so brutally and vividly made horror, shocked my prepubescent mind. Perhaps the only good that came of out this experience, was that as I grew from Boy to Man, I developed a hatred from those of my gender who would - for any reason - abuse a girl.Fast forward 25 years.In looking through movies to download I came across the 2009 version of this movie and decided to watch it. Mostly, I think, because I was stupidly curious to see if now (as a Man) it would affect me as deeply as did the original (as a Boy).The answer, simply put, is yes. This is a horrible, evil movie.I'm much older now, and sadly far more jaded and accustomed to the evils of this world, but the rape scene (which is pivotal for the plot) is possibly even more graphic and horrific than the original.As a fan of cinema, I can appreciate the cinematography (which was executed nicely), I liked the location of the shoot (the Helderberg Natural Reserve in So. Africa), and I even chuckled over the stilted acting of a cast of C-list actors for the mere purpose of asking myself ""Jeez... do ya'll really need the $20K they're paying you for this bullshit?""But...The pivotal point of the movie - and what ""drives the motivation of the characters,"" as they say - is the rape of the virginal daughter, afterwhich she's shot in the back and left to die, trying to run away.Everything that happens thereafter is just basic ""Schlock-Shock"" nonsense. (Mommy and Daddy find out that the strangers at their door killed/raped their daughter, they enact their revenge in gruesome ways, blah, blah, blah.) The thing is, and the reason why I strongly urge you NOT to watch this movie, is that the rape-scene, as horrible and ugly as it is, has no redeeming value. Schindler's List, for instance, is a tough movie to watch, and Lord knows it's portrayal of evil is heart-wrenchingly vivid, but at the end of that movie you walk away with a sense of what is Right and what is Wrong, no? Moreover, you're given an idea of how to fight the Evil.""Last House"" is essentially a snuff-flick, with no redeeming virtue in it's portrayal of Evil. Dante should've added a special circle of Hell reserved for actors, directors and writers who produce such dreck, and if you're such a twisted bastard who gets off on this kind of sickness, I suggest you rent something like ""Faces of Death"" and masturbate to it ere going to damnation.(Note for Parents: The ONLY possible reason to watch this movie, is to show your daughters the first 20 minutes. Tell your child that just because she's 18 and thinks she's an adult, she's still very much a child. This world is a scary place, at times, and sadly there are very few men whom are worthy of being trusted.)Write back if you agreed or disagreed with this Review.

I am in awe.If you like horror movies, you'll think this is just dumb. I think even the most hardcore horror movie junkies could be offended at some parts.The characters are vile, unrealistic and unbelievable.

290,jamesmcdonald85,"Being a remake, they should have tried to go farther!",6,16 March 2009,"There were a lot of stuff that disappointed me about the remake of LHOTL. For starters: it definitely didn't try to take anything a step further. the violence in this movie is toned down. Second: The guy that plays Krug is definitely not any match against David Hess--who frightened the hell out of me when i saw the original. Sure, the guy who played Krug in the remake was sick and demented, but he felt more like a bad guy out of an action movie; his character just wasn't scary. Also, i didn't feel any terror for him when he gets his head put in the microwave at the end. In the original: Wes Craven turned his antagonists into regular people at the end, so we could also feel their terror. I thought it worked since i usually root for the antagonists in movies. And also: ""Mari doesn't die in this one!"" I think that's what ruined the entire point. In the original: Mari getting killed off was one of the awesome climaxes.The film does have some good stuff about it, though. The acting was much better than the original (with the exception of Sadie and Paige) Tony Golwin does a much better job than Gaylord St James. The girl that played Mari also impressed me.

And it did prove a good lesson. I just saw the remake and I was very impressed. It was very well done and I give a hand to Wes on this remake. I read comments about how horrific the rape scene was in this movie. To tell you the truth, I found this remake a lot tamer then the orig version. What they did to the 2 girls in the orig was more horrific then the remake. The orig had the girls doing lesbian scenes and pissing themselves. And the parents are less savage in the remake.

Whether the director was attempting to make the viewer feel shock or pain to justify the parents acts of revenge was not presented well by the length of these scenes. By now in this day and age we all know what was happening to the young girl but the length of the scene was ridiculous. Unlike movies such as ""The Accused"" in which the length of the rape scene was justified, the close up photography was simply unessacary here. Watching a close up someone drive a knife into another young lady and then focus in on the wound was again pointless and unnecessary . Purely a gross film that will not be remembered and nor will the director and when it's promoted as being from the creators of such films as ""The Hills Have Eye's"" then you would know that this picture is not built on quality just shocking quantity, would only appeal to the lowest moral denominator.

There is a rape scene right in the middle of the movie which i thought was completely unnecessary. How did the American cinema stoop so low. Teenage girls getting raped and stabbed in the middle of the forest while crying for help. Does anyone else see anything wrong with that or is it just me.And how could anyone enjoy this movie without thinking this isn't right. I remember a time when i would watch a horror movie and jump up in my chair but i knew it was fictional and i enjoyed being scared to death.

That's putting it nicely. There are subtle and more creative ways to imply a rape, if it's absolutely necessary for a movie to even have one. This was just crude and barbaric. One of the worst and offencive movies I have seen. I do not recommend it one bit. I didn't even finish it so I don't know how it ends. Maybe the victim gets some vindication I don't know.

You are way better with any Tarantino movie. Or even the first ones from the Saw saga. Looking for an amazing script regarding vengeance? Do yourself a favor and watch Chan-Wook Park's Lady Vengeance. This sleep-inducing remake just doesn't deliver in any of those subjects.My biggest problem is with the rhythm. It could easily lose half an hour in length, and that would make it a little more entertaining.

299,ralb10,I didn't like the remake,3,5 September 2009,"I saw the original LHOTL, and nothing can top it for sheer brutality. The death of Phyllis was incredibly brutal. The gritty documentary style of the original made it seem that much more real. The casting of David Hess and Fred Lincoln was inspired. There was no trace of humanity in either of them. They really seemed like criminals. ""Chaos"" actually came closest to duplicating the original. A lot of people didn't like ""Chaos,"" but we're living in PC times. ""Chaos"" takes a no prisoners approach. The new LHOTL definitely is not as disturbing as the original, and if you watch a movie like LHOTL, it SHOULD be disturbing. The casting of Krug with some pretty boy really didn't work. He was just too good-looking. He had sensitive eyes, not cold eyes like the original Krug. The fact that Mari survives (as well as Krug's son) in this one makes this not as hard hitting. In the original, after everyone is disposed of, the parents are empty shells. Their daughter is dead, and they have nothing to live for. The ending of the newer version, with the microwave scene, just added gratuitous violence, but accomplished nothing like the ending in the original, which was total loss.",The Last House on the Left

While it is a personal subject for me, I'm sure that even for those which is not personal suffered problems with the scene as well.Bias aside, it seemed to be building up to be a fairly good horror/suspense movie. There's the obvious sense of impending dread as soon as you see the daughter, since there's no question that she's going to die, as is common in the genre. What a waste of swimming talent, right? Unlike most of these types of films, where a couple of stupid choices lead the young group of kids walking right into a chainsaw, the girls are unsuspecting and fairly undeserving of their brutal murders.All this being said, I'm sure the last hour or so of the movie had just as much disturbing gore as the first, just as much vengeance and just as much suspense, but I didn't stay to watch it.Though I did stay long enough to get the moral of the story.

With these very negative expectations, The Last House on the Left surprised me greatly by being one of the better thrillers I had seen in quite a while! The acting was almost shockingly good (especially in comparison to the original film), The script was very effective, and the score by John Murphy was really perfect in how it drove and complemented the suspense. The remake improved upon its source material in so many ways: the better parts of the original were kept, while some of the stupider unnecessary exploitation was cut, making the level of violence in the film brutally realistic rather than intentionally offensive. The pacing was also significantly better, with what I would consider a nearly perfect balance between the exposition, the initial action, and the results of that action.

312,Dheneb,"Suspenseful, thrilling, tense and adrenaline-rushing",6,21 June 2010,"Now before I watched this, I expected something like 'Saw' and 'Hostel'. Like, just useless and mindless ongoing torture. You know, done just for the sake of gore and violence, nothing much. But this film did the violence in good taste. I mean, the murderers deserved what they got. Beside the raping and murdering of the innocent girls, we didn't see more innocent characters dying throughout (like those in the Saw and Hostel films). The characters getting killed off in this were murderers and they deserved to die that way. Trust me, you'll rather cheer for their disturbing deaths than to cringe or feel disturbed by them.So the film starts, I wasn't that enthusiastic. The opening scene was so-so and really unnecessary. After that is when the film really starts, because we got to know the crucial characters. As soon as the girls are kidnapped, the suspense begins. From that moment on, I started to feel all tense, uneasy and even excited because I really wanted to see what happened next. Many scenes made you anticipate the next scene. That was one good thing about this film. The last film that made feel very tense was Flightplan (2005), which I watched back in 2006/2007.The bad thing about it was the music. Sure, it had its moments, but I hated when they used electric guitar during some tense scenes. John Murphy is one bad composer, methinks. He should do comedy, romances or drama, not thrillers. Another negative thing was the very ending scene involving the microwave. It was a little over the top.Contrary to the sources that label this a horror, the film wasn't scary. It was not a horror movie at all. Don't expect a movie like 'The Strangers', 'Halloween' or 'Blair Witch Project'. It was a revenge thriller similar to 'Taken' and 'Kill Bill'. There are virtually no jump scenes and even scary scenes in this (only if you count gore as scary).All in all, this is a nail-biting, riveting and pulse-pounding thriller. The writer is Carl Ellsworth, who wrote some great recent thrillers like 'Disturbia' and 'Red Eye'. If you liked those, then you'll definitely like this film.",The Last House on the Left

So this movie begins with two cops driving Krug, the evil leader of the group to a jail. they come across a stop and the car is attacked by Krugs Brother and his Creepy yet hot girlfriend Sadie.After killing the cops and forcing one to bleed on the pictures of his kids, we see Mari and her family on their way to their vacation home. When they get there and unpack, Mari decides it would be nice to visit her friend Paige, and leave her parents to be alone. With her friend Paige, Mari finds herself in a hotel room with Justin the guy they followed to score drugs. Thus, begins the violence. Justin's Father Krug, walks in with Sadie and Francis, and after knocking Paige out for the first time, they drive the girls to a wooded area, after failed get away attempts Paige is stabbed to death in front of Mari after calling Krug Pathetic. Krug then begins to violently rape Mari. Long Story short when they think they killed Mari they take shelter in, Maris home with her parents. When they realize who they are and what they did, they begin their revenge.Overall this movie was Great, one of the more enjoyable remakes of our time, Sara Paxton has shone a new light, and i feel she is capable of many things. 7/10",The Last House on the Left

318,lfader,wish i'd walked out sooner,1,15 March 2009,"well if i got anything at all from this movie it was the lesson that i will NEVER again go see a movie without reading about it first. my husband dragged me to this because he thought it was a horror/scary movie and wanted to see it in the theater. i'm not into horror movies but i figured i'd be a good wife and i'd just close my eyes if need be. well, long story short i walked out of this movie apparently right before it got much worse. once the truck crashed in the woods i spent about 10 minutes brooding and trying to ignore what was going on. but the graphic closeups and gruesome sound effects made that impossible. an older couple in front of me got up to walk out and i took that as my out too. i couldn't stand to be in that theater one more second. i walked out just as the rape began. wish i'd walked out even sooner. i guess if you like watching graphic violence, then this movie is for you. as far as movies go i suppose it was well made. it certainly was real enough.",The Last House on the Left
319,birdofjoveinc,this movie is not a thriller,1,21 August 2009,"This film reminds me a lot of a film that was done some time in the late sixties or the early seventies. I cannot remember what they called the original but I hated it which probably explains why I cannot remember it's name. This film is even worse. Let me explain. The thriller genre has nothing to do with graphic violence. A thriller is any movie that is a mystery with lots of plot twists. Blood and gore and dehumanizing violence is NOT a part of the thriller equation. The only reason I rented the movie is because I have a serious hankering for a thriller (a good thriller). Trouble is, Hollywood does not make very many true thrillers anymore. Twenty years ago, the stuff that passes off as a thriller today would have been thought of as B rate horror, like this movie. Call me crazy but I do not like to watch people being victimized by brutal mindless criminals. It is just not entertainment as far as I am concerned. Now there are examples of violent films that are entertaining but this is not one of them.",The Last House on the Left
320,MikeMooreHorrorNGore,Greatest Horror Movie Ever Made!,10,15 May 2009,"I've always hated remakes and said there is no way that you could remake The Last House on the Left into something better, and guess what......I Was Wrong! To be quiet honest this remake of The Last House on the Left is the greatest horror movie of ALL time! One of the best movie's ever made next to The Dark Knight. The remake of The Last House on the Left is more graphic in violence and you just have to gasp at it at times this movie uses new ways of killing people such as, a garbage disposal & a microwave! The rape scene that was supposedly to graphic to were people walked out of the theater was the most non-explicit rape scene I've ever scene, there isn't even a boob, which was perfect! The Last House on the Left (2009) is way different from the 1972 version, and much, much greater. After I first saw the 1972 version I thought that it was the greatest horror movie of all time, I take that back after seeing this remake. I highly recommend it! At the end of the movie it all fit perfectly with no complaints you leave with your jaw dropped, not because of it being disturbing because its far from it, but because of the graphic violence and the powerful storyline and aftermath. This was a truly remarkable film with the most unexpecting and awesome ending I've seen since The Midnight Meat Train. The Last House on the Left is the greatest horror movie ever made.Comment by, Mike Moore",The Last House on the Left
321,jake-dawson,Best remake in years!,10,12 June 2009,"This is my first review on IMDb so be gentle! I was so pleased with the film I joined to let others know my views. I have seen my fair share of remakes and have been very disappointed with the majority of them, I am happy to say I found this to be a very worthy remake, I would go as far to say that it was actually better than the original in a lot of ways! I watched the original as a child and found it pretty disturbing but a very well executed horror, I recently watched it again in anticipation of the 2009 release and wasn't as impressed, I know that the grainy dated footage added something to the film, somehow documentary style and with the budget they had Wes Craven done a very good job, however I think it was let down a bit by the music which was very inappropriate and sounded like it could have been in a comedy this and the fact my girlfriend was giggling at some of the movie didn't help, particularly the two policemen and their antics, they seemed like a comedy duo which detracted from the dark story, maybe this was deliberate and was intended to give us a break from the harsh storyline? However that aside it is a classic film which I was hoping would be done justice.Enough about the original on to the 2009 remake, the film sticks very true to the original, some people are not happy about the small changes but I think they added to the film, made it more believable, gave us more information about the characters, made us care more about what was going to happen, I wont go in to any details, I don't want to ruin it for anyone but I think the changes made this in to a much more rewarding film for the viewer. I have read other reviews complaining it went too far, that they should have left certain scenes out, are you serious? why did you bother watching it, have you lived under a rock for the past 30 years, did you not know the original storyline? It had to have harrowing scenes which made you feel uncomfortable, the film would not have worked without them! I think this is the best remake I have seen in many years and give it 10 stars, very good acting, excellent directing and a great cast, it had a lot to live up to and it succeeded when so many other films have failed. I highly recommend this film to fans of the original and newcomers to The Last House On The Left.",The Last House on the Left
322,lord-boo,Pathetic Piece of Sh*t,1,21 June 2009,"I went to the cinema with my girlfriend tonight, after reading some good reviews of this film. I'm really a horror/thriller addict, so i was quiet excited about Last House On The Left 2009. I want you to know, that i registered here just to write a comment about this film. I gladly pronounce, that this was the worst movie i ever saw in my life. It was Full of violence and rape beyond reason, had no story at all. If i would drag a kid from kindergarten, he could write a better storyline. And at the top of all, it was awfully boring. I watched my clock almost every 5 minutes, hoping, that it will end soon. I like gory films, and i like films, that use violence as a tool to paint the murderers personality. But this.. this was nothing. A piece of sh*t. If u want to throw 2 hours of your life away for nothing, just pure filth, go and watch, but for gods sake, if you want a good movie, stay away from it!

Right from the get-go the characters get set up for an amazing plot line that leaves audiences ecstatic and fulfilled. Most of the scenes are well played out and I had a hard time finding a problem with the acting.One scene captures the real horror of rape. 10/10 for the acting on that scene and two thumbs up for the producers on their take of it. However, having had my cousin raped and murdered as a young girl the scene hits home a little hard so I'm throwing a word of caution to any who think it might bring up bad memories. Seriously, it's that graphic.All in all: Amazing movie. 10/10",The Last House on the Left
324,stu_denny,Below the belt,5,3 October 2009,"I have just watched The last House on the Left 2009, never seen the original and I'm pretty disappointed, Its just another one of those productions that the writers have lost their imagination so they attempt to make a film as gritty and shocking as possible.I am a big, big fan of 'real to life' and hard hitting films. However in this film, the scene where the girl Mari is raped for nearly five minutes is way below the belt. I think we have enough imagination left to understand when a girl is shoved to the floor and her clothes ripped off that she is going to be raped, its not necessary to see it happening.I do not see the point, whatsoever, of watching a young girl screaming with her head in the dirt and a guy thrusting for five minutes. And this raises some concerns for me as there will be plenty of weirdos out there watching this film getting their kicks out of it.If that scene did not give you the creeps I would recommend you re- evaluate your moral standing.",The Last House on the Left

Let me tell you, it was disgusting.The actual film looks nice and starts off OK. But then you get to the rape scene.This scene (in the unrated version) is completely vile and should never have been put on film. It is shot is such a way that you feel like you are right up close, and it is not a nice feeling. There is no reason to even shoot a scene as gratuitous and disgusting as this. Basically, this scene plays out as every woman's worst nightmare and it not only shocks and disgusts, but also traumatizes your brain. I felt like I had personally been violated and could not get those images out of my head. I want to warn everyone that, while the theatrical release version might be disturbing, but alright...the Unrated version is horrific. So horrific that I believe the movie should either have a large warning on the box to let people know just how disturbing it is, or it should be pulled from shelves!Do Not watch the Unrated version!",The Last House on the Left

327,sarahaseal,Rape scene too disturbing...,3,1 March 2010,"The premise of this movie was intriguing. A mother and father to exact revenge upon the assaulter(s) of their daughter. Sounds like a great movie. I love these kinds of movies. To be honest, the suspense was amazing in this movie, it kept you on the edge of your seat.In spite of all of the above comments... I HATED this movie with a passion. I couldn't get the images of the rape scene out of my head for days. They even threw in the sounds of the clapping of his body against hers... I was mortified. I have no idea how long this scene lasted, but it felt like an eternity. I used to enjoy horror/thriller movies... but now I fear that I will have to find out spoilers to all the movies I watch, to make sure that I know what I'm in for before I watch it. I read at least 2 descriptions of this movie, and both only mention two teenage girls being ""assaulted"". I had to dig deeper to find out that one had her clothes torn off and was horrifically raped during a scene of the movie.If you can handle those kinds of horrific images, then maybe you would enjoy this movie. Honestly, I wanted to see the most brutal revenge placed on these disgusting people; but I was sadly disappointed. Maybe I'm just a crazy person, but if someone did that to MY daughter, and I had my hands on them... I would keep them suffering for weeks before I ended their pathetic existence. I would have at least shown that man the same kindness that he had shown my daughter (By that I mean I would have raped him with that f**king fire poker).Anyways, you are fairly warned...

Had the makes of ""A Violent History"" to it. Soon enough it was sure to let me down. I don't want to give it away for anyone, but if you hate it when its time for the victims to get revenge, they do it in the dumbest fashion ever. Its this unbelievable ""shock"" that they are in that I hate. I would much rather see a believable fight, with real rage and hatred involved in the character's actions. There are some cool effects though used in some of the fight scenes. Overall, I would have like to see the movie finish off more realistically, and stay away from concentrating so hard on making it suspenseful.

But, sometimes this genre of film can be spoilt with predictable horror clichés, an ending destined for sequel hints and actors that don't give a character justice. I am pleasantly surprised to say this one shocked the living daylights out of me and I was hiding behind the pillow most of the way.The storyline had good depth and loved the way that most scenes were connected and were later included into a major part of the story's outcome.The acting is fantastic - not one character can be considered ""cheesey"" - they all deliver beyond what a script can layout.I will admit a few of the scenes did make me very near sick to my stomach due to graphic nature of the filming and scenario played out so well with the actors involved.

Easily one of the all time worst movies ever made. Not only is this film full of continuity errors, atrocious dialog and painful performances, there is a rape scene that drags on for entirely too long. In my opinion, it's hard to understand why a rape scene is needed to tell any story properly. It seems that basic human decency would serve as a guide to keep gratuitous scenes of rape to a minimum. However, there is a rape scene in this movie that goes on for entirely too long and is graphic beyond what is necessary to move the scene along.

I Spit on Your Grave (1978), AKA Day of the Woman, is about a woman who is raped then kills her rapists. The Last House on the Left is pretty much about the same thing except in this movie the parents of the rape victim kill the rapists. If you like this movie you are sure to like I Spit on Your Grave. My only complaint is when i viewed the content advisory page i got the feeling it was gonna be a movie with a lot of sex and violence based on what was written.

They should be in a new category called ""Sexual Assault."" Dismemberment, rape, cruelty, and this level of violence is so easy and so in vogue. It merits a big ""0"". Give me something really scary.

The movie was advertised mostly about the family trying to get even for a daughter's abductor but the first half if basically the girls being abducted, raped, and killed.

341,kavonbor,Gratuitous Violence at Best,2,14 September 2009,"Having never watched the original that spawned this remake I will do my best to write an accurate review. In a word, this film was Godawful. Everything about each scene of this movie screamed gratuitous. We've all heard this word used before, ""Gratuitous"". We all know what it means and it is often used to describe scenes from movies that are horrid or repulsive. I decided to Bing the word to read the actual definition. What I found is that gratuitous is actually the wrong word to describe the few but violent scenes in this movie. Using gratuitous to describe these scenes is like using the term freedom fighters to describe terrorists. For Last House on the Left (2009), my word of choice would have to be disgusting. The production quality as well as the quality of acting rises above many other movies of this genre. Missing from this movie were the scary surprises of a bad guy jumping into the frame, or of a an axe chopping through a door. So I learned early on to not necessarily expect the 'norm' in this one. The director left the traditional tools of the trade home. Instead, he apparently chose shock over scare. The opening scene at the railroad tracks was not bad in itself. I am guessing the scene with the photograph was meant to demonstrate how evil the main bad guy was. Point taken. But wouldn't the seat belt and gunshot scenes have sufficed? I guess not. The roles of husband and wife were played well. No flaws found. As a mom, the wife seemed wrong at first, as I mistook her for the daughter's best friend or sister rather then her mother. Small detail forgiven, let's move on. The back story of the loss in the family is never really developed and I am guessing it simply served to deliver a explanation for the necklace. Still, why waste the time building the story if it serves no purpose to the main plot? Smaller detail forgiven, let's move on - again. It is time to pause for a public service announcement of sorts; If you want your child or children to never pick up pot smoking, sit them on their couch with a bowl of popcorn and a 128 ounce cup of soda, and make them watch this movie - you have my permission to go to the scene selection menu and choose the motel scene as your starting point, ending wherever you feel appropriate to your child's age and maturity level. Trying not to inject a plot spoiler here, let's just say that I will never buy weed from a kid hanging outside a motel room again. (that last line was a joke - seriously). OK. Back to the review. The rest of the movie comes across as filler material. I mean, this is not clear at first. You'd think there was a point to the post-motel scenes other then being a vehicle to deliver shocker scene number 2 of the movie. This is where disgusting comes in to take gratuitous's place. I didn't feel bad for what was happening to this character, which should be the point, correct? Yes. I felt disgusted. It was disgusting to watch. Sorry for the potential spoiler here, but this movie may have done with this scene what media overall does to woman, making them objects. The daughter, shown scantily clad early on, followed by the friend in bra later, are just tools of the film makers here. I remain at a loss to determine the purpose of the extended (all the way to 'finish' let's just say) rape scene that was portrayed. The scene was shot ala porn flick. To explain what I mean, let's all understand that simulated rape is banned (i think and hope) from even the hardest of pornography movies - at least in the United States. But is simulated rape banned from main stream movies? I don't know, and if it is you wouldn't know that from watching this scene. My problem you ask? (other then this being a bad movie) Well, let's flash to the early scene of the young daughter, shot like a Lifetime Channel Daniel Steele book-to-movie steamy sex scene, the camera traces the girls wet skin slowly enough to seduce a monk (comedic license requested please). And then repeats it - actually, it appears the same 9 seconds (an estimate) of footage was looped just in case you needed more time for - never mind. OK, so hopefully your still with me. Now, back to disgusting shocker scene number 2. This same girl, apparently being shot by the same cameraman from the Lifetime Channel scene I just mentioned, is being raped but the camera barely focuses on the horror or emotion (see Accused with Jody Foster) of the tragic mental torture and emotional murder she is experiencing, but instead shows us her body's 'curves' (to put it mildly). What the -blank-? I'm no prude when it comes to scary movies, thriller movies, or horror movies, but I kept thinking to myself, and aloud to my girlfriend (and her to I), ""what the hell?"". This as far as I know is not a documentary. It is obviously designed for entertainment only. But the director felt it necessary to show us what so few movies ever dare show on film. This movie is tragic. Perpetrated into production by thoughtless and selfish people. The remaining scenes are all about revenge of course, acted with perfection. Which we all want, but somehow don't. Unlike the revenge we get in Sleeping With the Enemy, this feels different. Perhaps the microwave scene would have felt better with the director ending up in the main bad guys predicament instead, begging for his soul instead of his life because I ask the director this, have you no soul?",The Last House on the Left
