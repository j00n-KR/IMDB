0,Leofwine_draca,Misses the mark,3,11 November 2015,"TEETH is a dumb comedy horror film with an outrageous premise and shockingly poor execution. Obviously shot on the cheap in a couple of outdoor locations and somebody's home, this was written and directed by the unlikely-monikered Mitchell Lichtenstein, and has a single-sentence set-up: a teenage girl's vagina has teeth.There's no more plot to the film than that, and it's a singularly unwieldy premise to deal with. As you'd expect, there are a fair share of eye-watering gross-out moments here that will make any male viewers wince, but other than the cheap gore effects, TEETH has very little going for it. The characterisation is non-existent and the entire cast seem to give humdrum performances, particularly lead actress Jess Weixler.The pacing is very slow, the humour is non-existent, and there's never a sense of horror or menace. In fact, it's just very silly. I guess they could have made this a parable about puberty or a metaphor for a girl coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality or something but instead TEETH misses the mark throughout and is oddly toothless as a result.",Teeth
1,SnoopyStyle,a couple of surprising laughs,6,18 August 2016,"In the shadow of the nuclear power plant, Dawn O'Keefe (Jess Weixler) grew up with a hidden mutation. During childhood, her mutation bit her stepbrother Brad's finger. In school, Dawn leads an abstinence group. She falls for Tobey but she is restricted by her curse. She joins him at the local swimming hole. He forces himself on her leading to dire incident.This surprised me with a couple of good laughs. It's mostly derived from Jess Weixlet's dead-pan serious performance. She's great and pulls off the ridiculous material. There are a few shocking scenes like the gynecologist scene and the dismembered members that deliver uncomfortable fun. This world could add a little more to the build. She could use a female best friend and more time with her mother.",Teeth
2,claudio_carvalho,Vagina Dentata - One of the Most Refreshing Horror Tales,7,24 February 2009,"In a small town nearby a nuclear power facility, the chaste Dawn (Jess Weixler) is raised with her dysfunctional stepbrother Brad (John Hensley) by her mother that is sick and her stepfather. Once in high school, she participates of a meeting called ""The Promise O"" that preaches purity and virginity for the members. When the newcomer Tobey (Hale Appleman) arrives in town, the naive Dawn feels that he is her soul mate and stays close to him. The proximity becomes attraction and Tobey does not control his hormones and forces Dawn to have intercourse with him in a cave in an isolated lake. However, he is castrated by her vagina and vanishes in the lake. The desperate Dawn runs to the library and discovers that she has the mythical ""Vagina Dentata"" and only a hero can rescue her.""Teeth"" is one of the most refreshing horror tales that I have recently seen. The story of a chaste teenager that finds that she has a ""Vagina Dentata"" is simply hilarious and surrealistic. The legend does really exist, and in accordance with the Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_dentata), ""various cultures have folk tales about women with toothed vaginae, frequently told as cautionary tales warning of the dangers of sex with strange women and to discourage the act of rape"". There could be also a subtle interpretation that could be the difficulty of Dawn to self-adjust to the womanhood, but I believe the intention of the author was simply uses the myth to make a gem of dark humor. The beauty of the sweet Jess Weixler is awesome. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not availableNote: On 06 April 2015, I saw this movie again.",Teeth
3,nogodnomasters,HORROR AND GOOD DARK COMEDY,10,8 June 2019,"**Contains plot points**
Dawn is a Promise Ring promoter. She loves purity. Her mother is terminally ill. Mom watches old movies where nuclear radiation has mutated indigenous species into monsters. Her step-brother smokes pot, has girls over and wants to make it with her. He seems to have a finger mutated as a partial tooth. Dad is rather meek. Dawn has been dating Toby, another Promise Ring person who is a ""near virgin."" In the background of the town are cooling towers symbol of a nuclear facility, except this one occasionally blows black smoke instead of white steam, like real cooling towers.One day Toby rapes Dawn, only to find she is packing molars. Toby (Hale Appleman) runs away (and dies) and leaves a piece of his manhood behind.At Dawn's next chastity jamboree she has trouble speaking. The crowd responds in unison eerily chanting standard catch phrases. Dawn does not realize she is a mutant because the state mandates that the female sex organ be covered with a large gold star in the biology book. Jess Weixler as Dawn gives us a wonderful performance, stealing our hearts like a young Winona Ryder.Nudity(Jess Weixler), sex, and f-bomb",Teeth
4,gavin6942,A Film That Sadly Went Under Many Radars,7,29 August 2010,"Dawn (Jess Weixler) is not like the other girls. For one thing, she's in high school and still a complete virgin. But also, she has a set of vicious teeth inside of her woman parts. And, wouldn't you know it, those boys just can't leave their mitts off of her... bad news for everyone involved.I have to give plenty of credit to writer/director Mitchell Lichtenstein, who is surprisingly older than you might expect for this sort of material. The only film I can even compare to this one as far as controversial subject matter is ""Sick Girl"". Lichtenstein, what other goodies do you have in store for us? Jess Weixler, who plays Dawn O'Keefe, was largely unknown but is now taking off... I suspect it has something to do with this role. The film seems to have a strong cult following, as I've heard about it multiple times in the past few years, despite not ever receiving a theatrical release and getting ignored by many mainstream outlets.The film shows penises -- a handful of them -- but not vaginas (a parallel to the textbook incident); is this ""modesty""? It's an interesting reversal where naked women are traditionally most acceptable in films. Even soft-core has no problem showing women mostly nude while shooting men at strange angles to avoid the slip of any genitalia.Jim Emerson, taking the place of Roger Ebert, ties this in to horror and science fiction history. ""The 1950s sci-fi premise would be that Dawn is the unfortunate victim of radioactivity, but there's something else in the air (and maybe the water) here. It's called sexuality, and it permeates her everyday life: from pop culture (parental-advisory lyrics, R and PG-13-rated movies) to anatomical textbook illustrations in health class to the hormones and pheromones that hang heavily in the atmosphere, like the fetid steam in a gymnasium locker room. Everywhere she turns, Dawn the dental damsel-in-distress is surrounded by temptation."" Emerson takes this is a bit far at times. The lyrics and movies part is his speculation, not made apparent in the film. And yes, while she does live in a world of temptation, she does not actually seem all that interested in boys. She easily maintains her virginity for a fair portion of the film, despite men's advances. He is correct to show that the sci-fi aspect is played down. While there is clearly heavy pollution in her backyard, we are never given that topic directly. This is never an anti-pollution film, despite that being the implied source of Dawn's mutation.Emerson also draws the horror parallel: ""While 'Carrie' is the obvious influence (with genital transmogrification instead of telekinesis, and the other sex doing the bulk of the bleeding), 'Teeth' could be seen as a 'Reefer Madness' for the New Chastity Generation. The camp sensibility, however, is fully self-aware."" Yes, the campiness is self-aware, and ""Carrie"" is hardly like ""Reefer Madness"" and the connection is pretty much a teenage girl going through life changes and lashing out on those who oppress her. The men doing the bleeding? That's a stretch... lay off the literary criticism when analyzing films.Anyway, ""Teeth"" is a must-see for sure. More and more often it seems that the underground films are the ones worth seeing, and this is no exception. You could go see the latest theater triumph (as I type this, it's ""The Last Exorcism""), but I assure you that you'll find Lichtenstein's ""Teeth"" to be far more satisfying and memorable.",Teeth
5,jboothmillard,Teeth,6,4 August 2011,"I heard the title of this film and expected something to do with dentistry, fangs or something more obvious, this however was not what I expected at all, directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein, the son of pop art / comic strip style artist Roy. Basically teenager Dawn (Jess Weixler) was born in a small town with a nuclear power plant facility, and she has grown up a stranger to her own body, unaware of biological stuff, but this could be because she promotes chastity. She is a speaker promoting ""The Promise O"" and the ring of purity, this means that anyone who wears the ring and takes the pledge of the group will not ever have sexual encounters with anyone until marriage. Dawn lives with her ill mother Kim (Vivienne Benesch), her step-father Bill (Lenny Von Dohlen) and hard-edged step-brother Brad (John Hensley), and she has an admirer in school classmate Tobey (Hale Appleman). The purity promise is very hard to stick to when she finds herself also attracted to Tobey, and one day they go into a remote cave in an isolated lake, and begin to have intercourse. However when Dawn refuses to go all the way he attempts to abuse her, and that is when she truly discovers her bodily curse, when his penis is bitten off, she runs away, and he is found later dead from bleeding. Dawn is very worried that there is something wrong with her vagina, so she sees a gynaecologist, Dr. Godfrey (Josh Pais), for the first time, and of course he and his fingers are victim to her unintentional biting from below. After being horrified by this occurrence twice she researches more about the vagina, and then she finds an online article about ""Vagina Dentata"", this basically means that she has teeth in her vagina that can bite when she is threatened or whatever. Dropping the whole purity thing Dawn feels ready to try and find a partner to have intercourse with and control her teeth below, and she meets who she thinks is her prince charming with admirer Ryan (Ashley Springer). The romance between them seems fine, and she can control her problem below, but of course he turns out to be a pig as well, and she retaliated by having her vagina bite his penis off too. Knowing she has this ability, she decides to punish the person who has given her the most to complain about, her step-brother Brad, who she seduces, and when he penis gets bitten off he is shocked to see his own dog eat it up. In the end Dawn is seemingly running away to somewhere else, hitchhiking she gets picked up by an awful old man obviously wanting attention, but the final moments sees Dawn smirking like she can do what she done before with her teeth. Also starring Julia Liliana as Gwen, Nicole Swahn as Melanie, Adam Wagner as Phil, Hunter Ulvog as Little Brad, Ava Ryen Plumb as Little Dawn, Trent Moore as Mr. Vincent, Mike Yager as Elliot and Nathan Parsons as Soda Spritzer. Weixler is bright and breezy as the innocent high school student with a deadly secret below, the story is pretty straight forward, but it is not just shocking to watch for those gory moments, it is actually surprisingly funny for them too, kind of like the dark humour in The Dentist, so all in all an entertaining black comedy horror. Good!",Teeth
6,Tweekums,Horror comedy that really bites,8,2 March 2019,"As this horror comedy opens we descend into what appears to be the perfect American town, apart from two ominous cooling towers in the background. Two young step-siblings, Dawn and Brad, are sitting in a paddling pool when Brad inappropriately touches his sister and suddenly his finger is bleeding as if bitten.Moving forward till they are teenagers Brad is a bit of a 'bad boy' while Dawn has become the voice of a group promoting sexual abstinence. She has yearnings, mostly for Tobey, but refuses to give into temptation. One day he forces matters and pays the price... Dawn isn't as other girls; she has teeth in her vagina! This shocking discovery understandable worries her but Tobey won't be the last person she bites.Given how old the myth of 'vagina dentata' is it rather surprising that it hasn't been used in more horror movies. The film manages to be quite funny even during moments that will have most male viewers wincing... it doesn't shy away from showing the results of her biting. The story does take a little while to really get going although this does mean we get to know the characters and the rather puritanical world they live in; even pictures in school textbooks depicting the female reproductive system are censored. When the gore starts it isn't excessive but neither does it shy away from being bloody. I liked the fact that no silly explanations are provided for her condition apart from her finding the ancient myths. The cast is impressive; most notably Jess Weixler who does a really impressive job as Dawn. Overall I'd recommend this to horror fans who like a laugh while wincing at what is going on.",Teeth
7,BA_Harrison,Watch out sleaze-bags: Dawn will chew you up and spit you out!,9,12 May 2008,"Quirky; offbeat; bizarre; demented: however you want to describe it, Teeth, by director Mitchell Lichtenstein, is certainly different, taking the age old myth of 'vagina dentata' and bringing it to life in the form of beautiful high school student Dawn (the lovely Jess Weixler, who is extremely talented and should go far).Subconsciously, Dawn is aware that she is different to other girls, and this has lead her to be afraid of her own sexuality. So far, she has successfully avoided mutilating males by taking a vow of celibacy until marriage, but when she takes a shine to fellow 'abstainer' Ryan (Ashley Springer), her resolve begins to weaken. Accompanying Ryan to a local beauty/make-out spot, she inevitably finds herself in a sexy clinch with the apparently not-so-innocent young man, but decides, at the last moment, to stick to her guns and not go any further. Ryan, however, has other ideas and proceeds to force himself on the poor girl.Big mistake! Seconds later, Ryan is clutching a bloody stump where his manhood used to beDawn's voracious vagina has claimed it's first victim!After a little research on Google, and a thorough examination (by a gyno who wishes he'd been a little gentler with his probing), it finally dawns on Dawn that she now needs to floss in two places. Still, an extra pair of gnashers seems to come in handy, since the comely lass has a knack of trusting the wrong type of man: slime-balls desperate to get into her knickers (even her own step-brother Brad, who was bitten on the finger by Dawn's nether regions as a kid, wants a piecealthough he is now understandably afraid of female genitalia and tends to opt for back-door action!).Teeth has taken a lot of flack from critics who claim that the film is unfair to menthat it is a pro-feminist movie which depicts all males as misogynistic sex-pests deserving of castration. Personally, I couldn't care less how us guys are portrayed in the film because I had far too much fun with the whole twisted concept: any film in which a girl graphically chews off guys' junk with her privates is a 'must-see' in my book!8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Teeth
8,moonspinner55,A horror comic about castration...just what the world was waiting for,2,3 October 2011,"Female teenager who preaches abstinence and wears a purity ring is date-raped after a swim by a boy she likes--even more unfortunate is her discovery at this moment that she has teeth in her vagina which can sever any intrusive object. Indie production with sick jokes and loud screaming; one presumes this type of thing would eventually get made, in one form or another, but only the masochistically curious need apply. For the record, leading lady Jess Weixler has an amazingly direct and assured screen presence that should serve her well in future movies (she does more for ""Teeth"" than it does for her). Not badly made, but about as far removed from a cinematic entertainment as you're likely to get. Weixler's bravado is most likely the principle reason several critics spoke generously of this, the other performances being pitched far too high. * from ****",Teeth
9,Quinoa1984,"part crafty and topical satire, part crazy 'feminist' horror story",7,16 February 2008,"I was a little worried about this going in, even as I loved the joke that was the premise: a vagina with razor sharp fangs inside the walls. How much could be done with something like this? As I found out, a lot more than I expected, but especially surrounding it as a nifty satire on the world of abstinence pledgers in high schools. There can never be enough room to make fun of these 'abstinence-only' folk who wear the ""Promise Rings"" and are amid a self-made desensitized cult that, in essence, dissuades those who do have romantic connections from giving in to their desires. And there's mythology to boot! If anything, the burgeoning relationship between Dawn (Jess Weixler) and Tobey (Hale Appleman) shouldn't be something they should ever have to avoid. But they do for ""purity"" sake, despite each others' curiosity about each other's bodies. The first attack is the most savage, and perhaps though the most anticipated, and with a sweet twist: it's a shock to each of them, as she has no idea what is ""down there"" (all the sex-ed textbooks have the vaginal area censored, this despite the penis right in diagram, a possible reference to how it turns out in visual-style in the picture as men may grab their crotches in unified pain).To be sure, some of the satirical jabs and slight plot twists aren't totally effective. While the brother character (effectively played as scum by John Hensley) is needed to move the plot along at a crucial point, there's never much explanation to how he's such a sex-psycho with a big dog. There's also a touch of familial drama that feels a little forced (though, again, as part of disbelief that must be upheld throughout). What I liked, and at times even loved, as the pure abandon, like a talented filmmaker tackling the sexploitation genre with some juicy under-cutting to the society that this springs out of. Somehow this guy in his 50s- his first feature no less after years of acting gigs- has crafted some of the funniest penis jokes that could never be fathomed by, um, most people. To say it's a guilty pleasure doesn't do it justice, be it the most obvious jabs or the visual gags and symbolism (the cave opening, the phallic rocks, etc).One more note: this is truly a ""breakout"" performance as Weixler plays Dawn for all its worth as a character who truly has an ""arc"", if you could call it that. Whether it's the sexually confused innocent early in the film, to the totally mind-f****d soul who realizes an old myth called Vagina Dentata may be why she has this via nuclear radiation, and then onward as someone who can use that tunnel of love for all its worth. She's someone to look out for in the indie world, and leads this film along like it's worth every minute. 7.5/10",Teeth
10,Coventry,"Watch out boy, she'll chew you up ...",8,11 January 2009,"Writer/director Mitchell Lichtenstein at least deserves some sort of symbolic award for coming up with one of the most original and refreshing new horror concepts of the last 10-15 years. In a time and era where the horror genre is dominated by remakes of older classics and vile torture-porn movies, Lichtenstein thought up an old-fashioned and tongue-in-cheek parody with mythological influences and a small-town-folks atmosphere. ""Teeth"" is a splendid little film and of the most pleasant surprises I encountered in a long while, especially because it successfully blends comedy and nostalgia with a handful of disturbing themes and uncanny gore effects. ""Teeth"" isn't the textbook title for the umpteenth wannabe eccentric vampire movie, but a modern day processing of the Vagina Dentata myth, which handles about women with teeth inside their vagina in order to scare off random men whilst waiting for the one right hero. Dawn's teenage years aren't the easiest ones. She lives with her terminally ill mother, stepfather and insufferably rebellious stepbrother Brad in a remote little town. She's a devoted believer of sexual abstinence and even encourages her fellow schoolmates to wait with sex until marriage. Her own principles are heavily challenged when she meets and falls for new kid in town Tobey, but she still manages to control her desires. Tobey can't, however, and he painfully experiences Dawn's physically build-in defense mechanism. The poor girl's in shock when she first sees the effect, naturally, but she gradually learns to use it as a protective tool against all the abusive and malignant men out there. The Vagina Denteta folklore tale mixes terrifically with the more typical drama themes in this film, namely the 'coming of age' chronicles and the 'dysfunctional family' portrait. This really isn't just another random horror movie, but a wide variety of relevant and identifiable stories with loads of genuine fears and sentiments. Dawn's abstinence beliefs as well as her mental restrictions and problematic family situation are extendedly portrayed before the toothed vagina even plays a role in the script. Once the first victim is castrated, ""Teeth"" definitely becomes more a more light-headed, gruesome and fast-paced film. Although definitely not being the bloodiest movie ever made, ""Teeth"" is likely to make a lot of (male) viewers squirm and squeal in their seats! The castration sequences are quite uncomfortable and they gradually more sadist. For obvious reasons the toothed vagina never gets shown, but I imagine it to look somewhat like the jaws of the Kraken monster that attacked Johnny Depp at the end of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"". The young cast is stupendous, particularly Jess Weixler as Dawn and John Hensley as her messed up stepbrother, and the film is literally crammed with unique little jokes and witty observations. For example, it's emphasized numerous times that Dawn and her family lives very near to a nuclear plant, and you're almost forced to assume the pollution will have something to do with the girl's condition, yet it's never confirmed or even hinted at any further. ""Teeth"" is a very good and innovative new film and comes highly recommended to all open-minded fans of cinema.",Teeth
11,michaelRokeefe,Shocking and memorable. A very special girl.,7,16 July 2008,"If you want something out of the ordinary. Something down right scary even to think about; and you're not exactly straddling that high moral ground...this movie just might be for you. Genital gore. High school student Dawn O'Keefe(Jess Weixler)is typical in concerns of suppressing her awakening sexuality. She is proud to be a virgin and leads a local chastity group. Dawn knows of her bodily purpose ""down there"", but a stranger to its function. Even more puzzling, she discovers she suffers from a mythical and cultural condition called Vagina Dentata, meaning a ""toothed vagina"". Troubled comprehending her anatomical uniqueness and trying to resist the overwhelming thoughts of the pleasure of the flesh...Dawn is more-or-less date raped and discovers the powerful and violent pitfalls of using her sexuality. There are several scenes that will make any conscious male to have second thoughts of where he ""sticks it"". Dark comedy, OK. Creepy, damn straight.

12,hitchcockthelegend,Girls have a natural modesty.,6,1 October 2014,"Teeth is based around the myth of vagina dentate, where it was believed that in some ladies a set of teeth were hiding away in their vagina. The lady in question here is Dawn O'Keefe (Jess Wexler), a comely virgin, teenage spokesperson for Christian abstinence, from a very young age it was clear something was not right.A great and interesting premise is never truly fulfilled for maximum potential here, but with slices of dark humour, some cringe inducing prosthetic gore and a bold performance from Wexler, Mitchell Lichtenstein's film safely keeps its head above mediocrity.The makers are dallying with a number of unsubtle themes, from female empowerment to the fear of sex in general, and of course the perils of letting shallow hormones dictate the teenage mandate. There's even dashes of obsession, religio slights and a meditation on grief that earths the electricity buzzing about the hormonal place.Thankfully, Lichtenstein keeps away from I Spit On Your Grave territory, finding a nice balance for Dawn, she is a character bombarded with a myriad of emotional conflicts, but hysteria does not dominate her make-up, and she's never cartoonish either. View it more as a genre splicer than outright horror and better rewards await the interested observer. 6/10",Teeth
13,Hey_Sweden,'No men were harmed during the making of this motion picture.',8,19 August 2012,"But it's a safe bet that some men will be traumatized by just the *thought* of what happens to the men in this film, happening to them. It's a hilariously dark comedy that does indeed turn into a story of female empowerment, and an interesting look into the whole idea / mythology of ""vagina dentata"", which here is sort of tied into species mutating as part of the process of evolution. (The whole nuclear connection is not forgotten, either, as the two stacks of a nuclear facility are often kept in sight.) All in all, this is a canny look at morals and attitudes regarding sex, and one of the more intriguing horror films to emerge in the last several years. Jess Weixler is winning in the role of Dawn, a high school student who teaches others to abstain from sex, only to learn a nasty truth about her own private parts, and the resulting potential consequences to any man who dares to get intimate with her. The gory bits of business give this film the sort of punch that it needs; the money shots are all quite delicious, even if they're not completely satisfying to all viewers. The film works best at its outlandish spin on one young woman's emerging sexuality and what it means for the men who will get close to her. We can see that by the end Dawn has realized the power that she has available. The acting by all concerned is solid, with John Hensley scoring in a truly repulsive part as the leering stepbrother Brad. This is the kind of thing that can have people with certain tastes howling with appreciative laughter at what goes on; one particular priceless bit concerns the fate of a severed member and a pet dog. This is well worth watching for horror fans of both genders, although the men may well find their knees locking together as the story plays out. Eight out of 10.",Teeth
14,poolandrews,Dark comedy horror that didn't do much for me.,4,26 May 2010,"Teeth starts as puritan high school student & devout virgin Dawn O'Keefe (Jess Weixler) gives yet another lecture on the evils of sex & promiscuity at a Christian speech, meanwhile fellow Christian virgin Tobey (Hale Appleman) starts school & both Dawn & Tobey fall in love against their better judgement & beliefs. However Tobey takes advantage of the situation & forces himself on Dawn, Tobey suddenly screams out in pain as his penis is severed inside Dawn as it turns out she has razor sharp teeth inside her vagina. At first scared Dawn soon comes to realise that she can use her odd gift in a way she believes God intended...Written, produced & directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein I keep hearing about how good Teeth is, how funny Teeth is, how clever Teeth is & how gory Teeth is but as of yet I have not seen the Teeth that those people have seen as I don't think it's any of those things at all. The script tries to be clever, sure it features various messages about sex before marriage & the whole anti sex stance of the Christian Chastity movement as well as scenes involving incest & of course a vagina with teeth although given it's premise & themes Teeth is a really rather tame film that does take itself very seriously. Despite the subject matter there is only one topless shot in the entire film & no scene featuring real vagina's & even the guy's aren't seen naked although there are a couple of severed cock's. Maybe I wasn't paying attention but the satire here fell flat for me, maybe it's because I am not in school or not a virgin or have had sex many times outside of marriage & not give a toss but I just didn't think Teeth had anything relevant to say to me. At over 90 minutes it's fairly slow & is rather pro-female as every bloke in Teeth is either a rapist, a sexual threat or some sleaze ball & the final shot says it all really.Teeth features scenes from other films including the monster flick The Black Scorpion (1957) which I watched a few weeks back & enjoyed (more than Teeth anyway) & the decent Hammer horror The Gorgon (1964) which I have also seen & also think is better than Teeth. There's a few gory moments, a few severed fingers, a couple of severed cock's including one which a Dog chew's on. Two industrial towers are seen throughout the film & I think the implication is that pollution caused Dawn's toothy vagina but no-one else seems to have been affected so besides an anti sex film Teeth is also trying to warn against the dangers of pollution. Surprisingly little nudity on offer there's only one topless shot & no full frontal nudity at all.Filmed in Austin in Texas this looks nice enough with good production values but I didn't like the story that much. The acting is pretty good, Jess Weixler is fine as is everyone else.Teeth is a film that a lot of people seem to like & think is some sort of amazingly original dark satire that will change your life, it isn't. It's well made & is sort of bizarre enough to warrant a watch but overall I found the character's poor, the morals questionable & the entertainment value lacking.",Teeth
15,Bunuel1976,"TEETH (Mitchell Lichtenstein, 2007) **1/2",6,1 April 2010,"Probably intended more as satire than outright horror (or even a cautionary tale about sexual promiscuity which, curiously enough, is directed by a male!), this essentially plays like a companion piece to the later JENNIFER'S BODY (2009) which I had watched earlier this month. In fact, the lead character here proves very similar to the geeky, non-monster heroine of that one; likewise, the central performance (by unknown Jess Weixler) holds the thin plot admirably together. Another drawback, however, is the rather sluggish pace – which is quite atypical for a modern genre effort with a teen backdrop. In any case, the connotations of the premise (the title alludes to the mythical ""Vagina Dentata"" which the heroine has to cope with apart from other more common dilemmas, such as caring for a terminally ill mother and resisting the unwholesome affections of her disturbed stepbrother!) are too obvious and comical in effect to generate much suspense!! The ending, then – in which Weixler embraces her fate – is equally predictable (especially since, once again, it virtually anticipates the last scene of JENNIFER'S BODY)!",Teeth

This is one mythological story that I would probably been better off not knowing.The story line and acting were nothing to write home about. It started off slow, and didn't pick up until it was almost over.

17,neil-476,Ouch!,7,11 March 2011,"Poor Dawn. As if it wasn't hard enough being a teenager and coping with the changes that puberty puts you through, it's a bit much when it turns out that you've grown a set of teeth in your most intimate location. Even worse, those teeth frequently seem to have a mind of their own. Mind you, when someone forces unwelcome and invasive attention on you, imagine their surprise...This is an original premise for a film which succeeds on several levels - teen rite of passage, comedy, and horror.

18,AlsExGal,Not just another teen movie!,7,23 June 2019,"This is an independent film that has not one actor or actress I have ever heard of, but, wow, is it original! The characters don't even have last names in their credits. They are just Dawn, Tobey, Bill, etc.Dawn is a high school girl who has taken a pledge of chastity until marriage. She is a classical beauty, a rather Scandinavian looking girl. She has a wastoid of a stepbrother (her stepdad's son) who spends his time sleeping, having rampant casual sex with a slew of girls, and keeping a ""pet"" attack dog in a cage in his room.Well, unfortunately, Dawn's first sexual experience, with a boy who seems so nice and so sweet on her, turns into assault with devastating effects on the boy, that being death. Dawn is at first horrified by what has happened, does some internet research, and realizes she has ""teeth"" down there. At first she feels like this is some kind of punishment, some kind of chastity belt, but then she realizes that these teeth only attack when she feels violated. As she learns to control these ""teeth"" she begins to feel empowered. And although the journey is unpredictable, the destination is entirely predictable from about a quarter of the way into the film. That's the reason I don't give it an eight.There is not an over abundance of gore, just enough so that you see what happened. I will say the film does have men coming off as very opportunistic, either that or Dawn is the unluckiest girl in the history of the world. And the film has one quirky gimmick. Throughout the film you see two towers of a nuclear power plant. The assumption you might make is that Dawn has this physical feature from growing up in the plant's shadow. But not one word is ever spoken about it. That's what makes it great. The film doesn't lecture you about anything that happens here. It just tells a story and leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusions, and it really works as a dark comedy/horror combo. I'd recommend it.",Teeth
19,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Bland, worthless and really uninteresting",1,1 February 2016,"After a series of strange incidents with her boyfriend and other men around town, a teen believes she has contracted a strange, mythical condition in her body and tries to find a way to keep it under control until she can live a normal life.This one was quite possibly one of the worst horror efforts released. Among the many flaws here is the film's rather challenging nature here, mainly because it's not a horror film and is instead a drama that includes a theme relevant to horror films and men in general. While the act present in the film is quite unnerving, the central premise of being unsure of what to do with it means that instead of pressing it to an advantage and being quite hesitant doesn't equate to an enjoyable time. Since this is coupled together with its intense religious dogma which presents her as a chaste virgin obsessed with the ideal of purity alongside her similarly-minded friends, this leaves the film so dreary, dull and lagging that nothing comes along to give the film any kind of momentum or energy not delving into any kind of action that really makes the condition something to be feared beyond the initial premise. Since each of the encounters come about due to almost raping her yet at the point where it was consensual nothing happened and she openly enjoyed and welcomed it takes out so much of the steam here that it really undoes the argument completely by saying she needs to just let go of her standards and want it to happen to let it occur without incident. This kind of situation really could've had more of an impact happening to a more sexually-active woman and make it more of a truly cautionary take here than what this one offers as it seems to say they deserve it simply for going for a virgin who just happens to have that condition. There's also the fact that this one doesn't have any real point in being labeled as a comedy since the dark, black humor here supposedly comes from seeing more get castrated which results in the only real funny material here as there's no jokes or humorous gags here yet nothing about any of these situations is in the slightest part funny and really lowers this one even further. While these issues hurt this one to the point of not even being a worthwhile horror film, the only positives here come from the graphic aftermath of each castration with the remains of each sniping shown in graphic, unflinching fashion with the spurting stump and disgraced unit all on full display here which leaves this one with rather squirm-inducing scenes in the water-fall and in the bedroom with her boyfriend, and the temptation of the sleazy step-brother closes that storyline nicely. Still, it's more the concept of these scenes meaning the most and the flaws here really sticking out.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Nudity, Graphic Language, Strong Sexual Content and themes and a Rape.",Teeth

21,Wuchakk,"Despite the exaggerated horror and black humor, it accurately reflects the coming-of-age years",8,28 January 2018,"RELEASED IN 2007 and written & directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein, ""Teeth"" concerns a teen girl (Jess Weixler) who leads an abstinence group at her church. While dating she horrifyingly learns of a unique feature. Meanwhile, her wicked stepbrother is getting out of hand (John Hensley). Hale Appleman and Ashley Springer play guys interested in her while Josh Pais appears as her gynecologist. Lenny von Dohlen is on hand as the stepfather. This is a coming-of-age movie mixed with horror, akin to ""The Rage: Carrie 2"" (1999). It's professionally-made and dramatically compelling with some good stuff on the soundtrack, like ""You Did"" by Chuck Prophet (which runs during the credits) and a few snippets of Immortal Dominion songs. Gore fans should be happy, but IMHO they shoulda toned it down because few viewers want to see someone's Captain Winky cut off. If you can handle that, there's a lot of good here, even greatness. The movie reflects reality despite some surreal elements, amusing black humor and the horrific mythos. Examples of what I mean include: The two (step) siblings who take contrary paths, father/son rivalry, the moral response to sexual relations (save yourself for marriage or indulge?), the positive (or negative) influence of religion and the ritualistic/group-think spirit thereof, not to mention turning a supposedly negative quality into a positive.Weixler kicks axx in the challenging role of the protagonist and is just an all-around beautiful woman.

22,zetes,Very good horror comedy,8,15 May 2011,"Jess Weixler plays a conservative teenager with a horrible secret hiding in her no-no zone in this horror-comedy. She's very popular among the Christian, abstinence-obsessed teens in her high school, and, though something of a joke to everyone else, many of the boys would love to poke a hole in her beliefs. Her step-brother (John Hensley) also harbors a secret desire, but he alone has an inkling of what she's hiding, due to a childhood injury he suffered at her, um, hand. Weixler herself doesn't quite understand what's wrong with her (nor does she know that she's in any way different from every other girl), but once she gets a sense of her unique gift, she decides to use it to her advantage. The film starts off kind of broad, like it's going to be very jokey and unkind to Christianity (as well as to non-Christians, as with her heavy-metal- and drug-loving step-brother), but the characters are actually quite well written. Weixler in particular is a find, playing both the comic and dramatic angles perfectly. Some of the film's plotting feels a bit off, but, overall, I thought this was original and excellent.",Teeth
23,trashgang,more comedy than horror,5,11 April 2012,"I thought to see a gory flick, really, being distributed by Dimension Extreme should deliver the real stuff. sadly it wasn't as gory as i thought it wasn't even scary. For me it was just a comedy with a few nasty shots.The first 30 minutes it was all about purity and being a virgin but Dawn (Jess Weixler) knew from childhood that she had a special vagina. One with teeth, the furious Vagina Dentata. Of course she hides herself with telling about being pure and never having sex but as a grown up she falls for a guy which turns wrong when he forces her to have sex. When the Vagina Dentata attacks the shots do shown some bloody results but I an understand that it would be difficult to show intimacy with a flick for teens, it would be X rated or R rated. But still for a horror it doesn't have anything to shown. There's no frontal nudity although Dawn do walks nude sometimes. You could easily see that Mitchell Lichtenstein, the director, isn't into horror. I admit, some shots aren't for the squeamish when the vagina has bitten but there's more comedy in the result, for example the dog eating his owners dick. I would recommend it to see it with some friends who like to see a big joke. The acting was rather good and saved the flick.

24,Buddy-51,"A Satire with Real ""Teeth"" to it",8,31 July 2008,"Michael Lichtenstein's ""Teeth"" is a pitch-dark feminist satire guaranteed to have the men in the audience squirming in their seats and crossing their legs in self-defense - while the women chant in ""you-go-girl!"" solidarity with the heroine. With an envelope-pushing tone reminiscent of the early works of John Waters, ""Teeth"" pulls out all the Freudian stops in its story of an attractive young abstinence-only advocate named Dawn (Jess Weixler) who, as the result of a mutation in her DNA, has developed a set of razor-sharp teeth in her private area - a condition known in ancient mythology as ""Vagina Dentata."" At first she is freaked out by the discovery, until she learns that she can use this bizarre anatomical anomaly as a weapon against any man who fails to respect her for the lady she is.With ironic detachment and outlandish humor, ""Teeth"" acknowledges that, in the depths of our collective subconscious, we have been conditioned to link sexual behavior with danger, mutilation and even death. Further, we have been taught to view women as somehow posing a threat to men's continued virility and survival. From the black widow spider to the archetypal figures like Pandora, Eve, the sirens and Medusa who inhabit our literature, females are frequently portrayed as irresistible creatures luring unsuspecting men to their doom (the death can be either literal or metaphoric). ""Teeth,"" in all its shocking outrageousness, simply finds the most graphic way imaginable of illustrating that theme.The movie takes place in one of those stifling suburban settings where vice, corruption and perversion always seem to be simmering just beneath the surface of tree-lined streets and perfectly manicured lawns - only in this film, the real threat is hidden not in the environment but within the human body itself (unless one counts the industrial smokestacks we see lurking in the background, pumping out a constant cloud of toxic chemicals, enough to give anyone's DNA a mutation or two).Dawn could have been portrayed from the start as a calculating shrew intent on emasculating every man in sight out of her own twisted sense of divine righteousness. Instead, Lichtenstein and Weixler bring a perplexed poignancy to the character, starting her off as a confused kid coming to terms with just what this will mean for her as she makes her way through life. It isn't until she flashes a final subversive smile at the camera as she heads on to her newest deserving victim that we sense that her transformation into a globe-trotting warrior for her gender is finally complete.""Teeth"" is definitely for those with an appreciation for the freaky and far-out.

25,thesar-2,Sink Them In,8,10 October 2013,"I'm puzzled on how much Teeth bothered me. Let me back up: Yes, I am a male, but what these boys went through in this movie – spoiler, sorry: castration by actual sharp teeth in a vagina (that is the premise, if you're upset about the spoiler) – would never, ever happen to meeven if some women had actual teeth in their vagina. And yet, it still freaked me out.I had shelved this clever and original little indie horror film on my watch-list for many years. Yeah, for the reason stated above. But, finally, getting around to it, I was thoroughly impressed with it.Sure, it's not a perfect movie and sometimes unbalanced, forced and had some questionable scenes – namely from the police's investigations, but the mood, acting and direction was all there, as was the horror.Taking from the time of the mid-2000s, Dawn is the purity-ring kind of girl. Of course, she has a reason: she's a product of mutation of a Venereal Disease to the Max. Not just has teeth evolved inside her vuvla, but it's a fully-function chopping machine too! So, naturally, even if she chose to, her sexual life might be a tadcomplicated. Oh, and it does, several times.As the movie, ah-hem, evolves, the movie carefully, and beautifully, keeps the suspense up by not adding a $100 million dollars in special effects. I'm not into CGI at all, especially from 2007 and the ""less you know/see"" theory worked very nicely here.I marveled in the originality, the low-key tone and definitely the finale. It might make heterosexual young males squirm – especially with the many examples of dismembered, um, members. But, it's still a fun and helluva ride to the end.* * * Final thoughts: Do I really need to explain why this wouldn't happen to me? Really?",Teeth
26,sol-kay,The Monster that challenged all of Mankind!,4,1 May 2008,"***SPOILERS*** In a idyllic little Texas town with two nuclear power silos, blowing off steam, in the background the black comedy ""Teeth"" is perfectly set for the unimaginable horrors that its audience is about to encounter.The film is about a young and innocent girl's uncontrollable rage that's about to, and in fact does, explode across he silver screen. A rage that hits those that its directed upon like a steel bear-trap never once letting go until something, of those it latches itself on to, finally snaps off.Dawn, Jess Weixler, has been very careful to keep herself away from the boys in school who constantly make fun of her for being the President of the school's Abstinent Club. A club that has it's members, both boys and girls, promise to keep their most precious gift, their virginity, intact until their wedding night.It's very early in the movie that Dawn discovered her secret powers when her horny six year-old step-brother Brad, John Hensley, tried to molest her in the family swimming pool. Brad almost ended up losing a finger in his failed and nasty effort. Now all grown up and filled out Dawn is soon going to encounter experiences from the horny teenage boys in school that will make them wish they never laid eyes on Dawn much less tried to ""know"" her.The film has Dawn, in her trying to keep herself from being deflowered, end up putting a number of teenage boys, as well as a local gynecologist, in the hospital and morgue with some of their extremities missing. It turns out that Dawn was born with an unusual and deadly defense mechanism that, when agitated, strikes back with an animal-like fury. This trap-like device grabs and completely devours, like a great white shark, its immobile and helpless victims in just a matter of seconds!It's very hard to find a movie like ""Teeth"" funny or even entertaining since you, especially if your a guy, just cringe every time Dawn's man trap snaps up its unsuspecting victims. Dawn herself who was so sweet and innocent at the beginning of the movie turns into a ferocious man-eating tiger or tigress. Dawn soon goes out, like Charles Bronson did hunting down muggers in ""Death Wish"", looking for and enticing men and teenage boys to make it with her so she can end up ""nutrilizing"" them.With the possible exception of her sleazy step-brother Brad no one really deserved to get what they got from Dawn in the movie. And even Brad was anything but the aggressor in attacking and trying to rape Dawn. It in fact was a sneaky and conniving Dawn herself who attacked Brad not the other way around, just before he got it and got it good, by her throwing herself on the startled and at the same time very happy young man.***SPOILER ALERT*** With everything else in the movie to be shocked about the ending was really too much to take. Dawn is picked up hitch-hiking by this obviously dirty old man, Doyle Carter, who after locking her in his car starts sneering and sticking out and wiggling his tongue at her.Dawns response to this sicko wasn't what you would have expected from a girl like her who all her life tried to avoid creeps like him. She in fact with a sexy come on hither stare, from Dawn's big blue eyes, actually lead the unsuspecting old jerk on! The horny old guy wouldn't find out the truth until much later, since the movie ended at that point, that what he was in for wasn't a roll in the hay, or the back seat of his car, with a girl young enough to be his great granddaughter! He instead is going to have a deadly and blood curdling encounter with what soon will become his absolute worst nightmare!",Teeth

You'd think there'd be at least some jokes about such a ludicrous concept.It features a girl gradually learning she has vagina dentata and finding out every man is a pervert and punishing them. It's hard to like a movie that's so sexist against men. I guess the acting wasn't bad, but the premise is just so insane. Maybe vagina dentata inspired the Sarlaac from ""Star Wars"".

31,Polaris_DiB,Coming-of-age,8,3 July 2009,"The trailer for this one went viral faster than the swine flu. In the world of horror movies, it's surprisingly rare to find a genuinely original concept--this one based off of an obscure archetype and proto-myth that shares in many cultures and directly relates to fear, the fear of men over women's sex. I saw the trailer and said to myself, ""Sign me up, I'm there."" Unfortunately, not very many copies of it were available to rent for the longest time, and I didn't want to buy it if Lichtenstein ended up messing up the original concept.Well, it was everything I wanted it to be, I must say! It starts a little slow and hokey, with an absurd Saved-like class of mindcontrolled kids preaching abstinence while Dawn eggs them on. However, the acting of Jess Weixler is immediately apparent (she knows her stuff), and eventually once things get going, the movie never fails to please.There are a few things of some importance here: 1) Werewolf movies are sort of like coming-of-age movies in the horror genre for men. Now we may have stumbled upon the perfect similar concept for women. 2) The movie does not shy away from showing freshly and violently castrated genetalia--which would have been assuredly a way to completely lose the concept if it did. 3) In horror, character development is relatively rare (sadly enough...), but here you get to journey with this girl from shy and brainwashed girl unknowledgeable about herself, to empowered woman who knows how to take care of herself. SWEET! 4) The movie ""explains"" how the vagina dentata come to be, but not within the dialog or plot, which is great.Thus, this movie is highly recommended to any fan of horror, girls coming-of-age, and people with a sense of humor and a stomach for gore. In my opinion, this movie stands to be a classic of American cinema.--PolarisDiB",Teeth
32,dee.reid,"""Teeth"" - Castration anxiety",10,6 May 2008,"""Teeth"" is a coming-of-age tale done in the spirit of ""Carrie"" (1976) in that it carefully examines a young girl becoming a woman. But ""Carrie"" had a twist: the protagonist Carrie White developed psychic powers, which she then used against the classmates who persistently tormented her. ""Teeth"" has a similar premise, one that's likely to instill castration anxiety in any oversexed male who watches it.""Teeth"" introduces the concept - for a wider audience - of ""vagina dentata"" (when translated from Latin, literally means ""toothed vagina,"" as in females having a nifty set of teeth between their legs), the same vagina dentata of ancient mythology given to women as a physical advantage during sexual intercourse and is meant to ward off men from having sex with strange women and instill harsh feelings of castration anxiety in those oversexed men. Writer/director Mitchell Lichtenstein takes his cues from ""Carrie"" and that ancient mythology to form the basis of his directorial debut; many may not know that ""Teeth"" is itself a remake of a small Japanese film called ""Sexual Parasite: Killer Pussy"" (2004) (I actually had to laugh at that title).As a 22-year-old male virgin, some of what I saw in this picture is quite shocking and had me squirming in my seat on more than one occasion, trying to hold on to my manhood (so to speak) and enjoy a well-crafted coming-of-age horror-comedy. But the movie isn't about male-bashing, nor is it really about female empowerment. If you look hard enough, the movie is really about sexual violence, that is violence perpetrated by men upon women and vice versa. In this cinematic battle of the sexes, no one is really favored to win, although it's obvious that most men, young and old, will think twice about having sex with the film's female protagonist by the time the credits begin to roll.The young heroine of ""Teeth"" is Dawn (Sundance Award-winner for Best Actress and - who some have called - Meryl Streep-in-training, Jess Weixler), a ""pretty but prim"" high school virgin who is hanging on to her sexual purity for dear life. In a tightly-knit Midwestern community that has ominous smoke stacks from the local chemical plant looming in the background, Dawn is the shining Christian example of abstinence at her school, where young men and women alike face all sorts of pressures to explore each others' bodies and let go of their virginity. In sex education courses, textbooks are featured that have taped-over diagrams of female genitalia but not male genitalia (a sexist double-standard?).Things aren't much better at home. The film opens with a rather disturbing childhood incident between Dawn and her step-brother Brad that renders him without the tip of one of his fingers. Now an adult, the psychotic and heavily tattooed Brad (John Hensley) spends his days doing his girlfriend in his bedroom while harboring incestuous feelings toward Dawn.Dawn only feels the sexual urges to let go of chastity getting stronger when she begins dating the like-minded Tobey (Hale Appleman), who eventually confesses to her that he's not a virgin; she isn't put off by the news, however. One thing leads to another and the two wind up in the sack, but when she rejects him, he forces himself upon her and - chomp! - no more Mr. Willy-Willy for Tobey. It is at this point that any males in the audience are likely to start squirming in their seats when they realize that Dawn has been gifted - or cursed? - with the Toothed Vagina of ancient mythology, and she then begins to use this new physical ability to her advantage against the horny young men who try to get in her pants without her express permission.""Teeth"" is not a particularly well-written first feature, since it can't decide what it wants to be - a horror film, a comedy, or a mix of both - and this is the film's only really big weakness. So, we have to take it for what it is: a horror-comedy. Jess Weixler is phenomenal; I'm not sure if she's really a young Meryl Streep-in-training, but she is a young actress to keep an eye out for and her Sundance award for Best Actress was well-deserved. Like Carrie, you sympathize with the heroine, even as she comes to terms with her new physical ability and blossoming sexuality, and uses them both against her tormentors. I've already pointed out the parallels to Carrie White, but it is pretty clear Lichtenstein is familiar with that story to at least draw some distinctions from that and ""Killer Pussy.""The film never really explores the extent of Dawn's Toothed Vagina or how she even achieved it, although there are a few clues here and there. It can be inferred that the vagina dentata are perhaps the next stage in the evolution of the female body (as explained in biology class). Or, are they simply a mutation caused by exposure to harmful chemicals put in the air by the local chemical plant? It's never really explained, and that's a good thing. Lastly, ""Teeth"" also has a lot of exposed flesh - male and female - and some pretty gruesome special effects sequences (though, weirdly enough, we never actually see Dawn's gift) that'll have any oversexed guys out there thinking twice about asking that pretty but strange new girl out for a date.10/10",Teeth

Dealing with heavy pressure from society to be both the virgin and the whore (she is in high school), she is in constant fear of her own body and sexuality.Soon, young men are likewise terrified since she suffers from the condition ""vagina dentata.""

Sort of like that nightmare puberty some people have but on steroids. You will not feel short changed by the suspense and macabre payoffs.Kind of campy in patches, it certainly makes for a more interesting viewing.You'll need to watch some Masha and the Bear or something after this.

36,Chris_Docker,Not something to get your teeth stuck into,5,16 August 2007,"Horror films have long used myth and psychological demons as a basis for gruesomeness. Teeth takes an underused legend (vagina dentata) and eats into the late night chick-flick gore-fest market with gusto and relish.Hold on - late night chick-flick gore-fest market? Isn't it just guys who go to see slasher stuff? Instead of vampires deflowering virgins we have a virgin de-penis-ing sleaze bags. Not so much I Spit on Your Grave as bible-thumping-bimbo-eats-willies.In one of the South Park episodes ('Red Hot Catholic Love'), that asks 'why Catholics must molest children,' we had a sect of Catholicism made of dangerous aliens. Their females have vaginas lined with razor-sharp teeth. South Park, of course, is unashamedly anti-everything polemic. Whereas Teeth is just entertainment. The lasting impact of such materials however, can be influenced by how well writer-producers have done their homework on matters psychological.Blonde high-schooler Dawn is a prominent representative of a chastity-ring -style movement. She discovers she has unusual anatomical 'adaptations' down there'. (She also has that expression that says something is permanently lodged up her butt.) But after she has alternately repelled and then encouraged a sweetheart who then rapes her, she is not unreasonably convinced that the bloody stump he is left with - and the dismembered member subsequently eaten by crabs - is the result of her deformity. Notwithstanding this, she manages to attract a series of pervs who get their fingers or manhoods lopped off.Teeth has the potential to deliver some biting social comment on the 'chastity' movement which has infected some American schools. In the classroom, Dawn's biology textbooks have stickers obscuring diagrams of the vulva - for 'obvious' reasons.At one point there, is a chance Dawn could become the crusader with a moral calling (rather than faith obedience). Much like the Troma legend, Toxic Avenger, who hunts down the city's bad guys. In a scene where a serial seducer drugs Dawn and then offers candlelight and romance to conclude the deed, is mistakenly seen as a 'good guy' by our heroine. She amazingly has successful sex with him, and willingly. She thinks he has fulfilled her dreams. But, when he boasts to mates on the phone in flagrante delicto, she changes her mind and chops it off. If the punishment was a little heavy for just being a loudmouth, there is a sense of justice as we know his intentions had nothing to do with consent. But although Dawn feels remorse over a similarly lecherous gynaecologist, she has no compunction about deliberate entrapment of males that she credits with evil intentions. And she does so as the heroine of our film.The vagina dentata myth is, as the film rightly points out, based on men's fear of sex. Compounding it with the modern craze by some youngsters for 'chastity' blurs the underlying psychology, even as a crowd-pleaser. The chaste woman in the sense upheld by Dawn's religious beliefs is the opposite of all that is pure about the symbols of womanhood. A shutting up, a mental 'castration,' to be reversed only by marriage. A cult that possibly even exacerbates sexual crime resulting from frustration, while denying a woman her own sexuality (A more extreme form is the barbaric practice in some countries of 'female circumcision.') The clarion call to support the heroine (who is depicted sympathetically) rests on an idea of female dominance as repugnant as the male domination of old patriarchal societies. It has developed, particularly in the USA, where American wives may even speak of husbands as men in the past spoke of a 'good, hard-working drudge'.The end credits quip that, ""No man was harmed in the making of this film."" But this reviewer at least feels that women who are psychologically conditioned to think in terms of 'chastity' or 'castrating men' are indeed harming themselves.To its credit, Teeth handles the difficult acting challenges with considerable aplomb. Jess Weixler's portrayal of Dawn is well-nuanced and brings much needed humour, ambivalence and self-doubt to her character. That the film succeeds at all is remarkable, and this first feature by writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein bodes well for his capabilities in handling difficult subject matter in the future commercial market. He succeeds in breathing life into a well-worn genre, but at the expense of ditching his moral compass. While the film is entertaining, it fails to achieve its full potential, or the cult status of indie classics like Liquid Sky (which was written by women rather than a man). But it certainly beats yet another slasher re-run with female protagonists enthusiastically chopping carrots.",Teeth
37,ptb-8,Gobbledy gook,2,26 February 2010,"I apologize, it is 2010 and I keep forgetting....mutilation is funny now. People having their limbs or faces or scalps or penises...well what can I say, it is sooooo hilarious in this clever new century. So here is the ultimate battle of the sexes comedy. This chick has teeth in her vagina and they chop off the penises of young men, often their knob falls on the floor or in the dirt or a dog eats it. God that is hilarious. ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS! Now that we have progressed from Doris Day films and Jack Lemmon comedies or those Neil Simon films they wasted all those Oscars awarding and Ferris Bueller teen junk, we smarter new century viewers can enjoy what matters most: identifying women as monsters and roaring with laughter at mutilation. I warmed up on HOSTEL (thanks Eli), positively chuckled at GRINDHOUSE during the bit when the stunt-woman's leg was torn off and flung down the road, giggled thru INGLORIOUS BASTERDS - especially the bit when the handsome young German had his scalped ripped off - but now ..hey! a muff with teeth: and it eats penises leaving the young man screaming in pain and his testicles covered in squirting blood. Hooray! Much better.",Teeth
38,ferbs54,A Gal Who's Both Toothsome And Toothsome!,7,30 May 2010,"There are certain flicks that I'm almost afraid to pop into the DVD player; 2007's ""Teeth"" was one of them. And really, a film about a woman with the condition classically known as ""vagina dentata"" (Latin for ""toothed vagina"")...it's gotta give ANY guy reason to pause! As it turns out, though, I needn't have worried, as the picture, despite some instances of grisly aftermath, is actually a beautifully shot, well-written, perfectly acted and very PC affair. In it, the viewer meets a pretty high school girl named Dawn O'Keefe, who is not only a virgin, but a leader of the local abstinence club. Dawn, as she soon learns after an unfortunate bout of date rape, is also afflicted with what the viewer can only infer is a vulvar mutation induced by the constantly billowing nuclear power plant coolers right behind her suburban home! Thus, heaven help the lusty lads and overly inquisitive Ob-Gyns who, uh, insert themselves where they have no business. Significantly, Dawn is perfectly capable of having normal, consensual sex; just don't tick her off! Thus, this supremely empowered woman will certainly appeal to feminists of all stripes, and I was not surprised to see that Camille Paglia was a consultant for the film. Writer/director Mitchell Lichtenstein's work is both assured and humorous here, and in a relatively no-name cast, Jess Weixler as Dawn impresses mightily as the understandably befuddled teen. ""No Man Was Harmed In The Making Of This Film,"" the credits tell us, and I for one was relieved to see that! The picture does for date rape what ""Jaws"" did for swimming, and will hopefully make guys hesitate before forcing their ""sexual favors"" on their lady friends! Oh...and howzabout that supercool song by Chuck Prophet, ""You Did (Bomp Shooby Dooby Bomp),"" that plays over the end credits? Gotta get that one in my collection!",Teeth
39,Jonny_Numb,Leave it to Beaver!,6,20 May 2008,"The trend of imbuing horror films with a quirky sense of irony cribbed from the hell that is adolescence (think ""Ghost World"" with gore) may have finally run out of steam with ""Teeth,"" a moderately impressive (though unspectacular) yet overly precious and self-aware stab at subverting the genre's gender roles. Writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein's concept (a puritanical virgin who grows up next to a nuclear power plant discovers a mean set of incisors below the waist when her sexuality blooms) is intriguing, and some of the film's best moments possess a surreal quality that almost transforms the material into a metaphorical extension of Dawn's (Jess Weixler) awkward adjustment to womanhood. While much has been written about gender roles in the horror genre, ""Teeth"" cleverly manages to have its cake and eat it, too: Dawn is treated as a haplessly naive girl by every male she encounters; the males are predatory, would-be rapists. In films like ""I Spit On Your Grave"" and ""Ms. 45,"" the female victims recover to enact revenge in an extreme manner--""Teeth"" playfully subverts Freud's notion of ""penis envy"" by transforming male genitalia into a literal kiss of death; Dawn's encounters (while tinged with a sometimes groan-inducing, ""Clueless""-styled humor) eventually contribute to her growth and maturity as a woman, to the point where she finally becomes master of her domain. While not great, ""Teeth"" is a worthwhile little sleeper with some food for thought.",Teeth
40,Samiam3,"Careful, she bites",7,26 August 2010,"Teeth has terrible taste, and yet when it's over you still want more of what it offers. I guess that is the movie's sole problem, it feels too short, either that or it is slightly under written. When it ended, it felt like there room room for another fifteen to twenty minutes of fun material to be milked from this surprisingly inventive idea. I was still satisfied though. Teeth flirts with the urban myth of Vagina dentata, or vaginal teeth. These teeth are inside Dawn O'Keefe who takes pride in being a virgin, even though she is kind of drawn to the new boy in school. There is an extreme sense of guilty pleasure generated from watching two or three dis likable young men get what they deserve, in loosing their ding dongs. It is both horrific and comedic, which it intends to be, but somehow it is not 'quite' enough. As perverted as it may sound, We are left wanting a bit more. But of course nothing is perfect. Teeth turns out to be pretty good for it's type, not many black comedies are as inventive as this one.",Teeth
41,Matt_Layden,Should Have Been More On The Comedic Side.,5,29 July 2009,"I'm all for good horror comedies and reading up on the premise of Teeth ad me rolling in laughter. It had the same feel of films like I Spit On Your Grave, the idea of a woman using her sexuality as a weapon to detach a man from his...manhood. Teeth could have played up the comedy a bit more and I would have enjoyed it more than I did, the problem was it played it way too straight.The premise of the film is based on old myth's that would scare boys into staying virgins until they were married. Females had teeth in their vagina that would bite off your penis, aptly titled Vagina Dentata. This horrid little circumstance has happened to our lead character, who is a virgin and a speaker for purity before marriage.She befriends another member of this group and has feelings towards him, he is a born again virgin. They go for a swim and his penis gets the best of him, he tries to rape her. Well, chomp chomp. His penis is bitten off and falls to the floor. He dies from falls back into the water and either drowns or dies from blood loss. It's never clear. She of course freaks out and goes to a gynecologist to see how things are down there. This is the funniest scene in the entire film.My problem with it though is that this film depicts every male character as either a pervert, rapist and molester. The step-brother degrades women and views them as sex objects, the friend tries to rape her, the gynecologist molests her, another man has a bet whether or not he can bang her and it ends with a creepy old man wiggling his tongue around suggesting more sexual things. Two separate times we see a penis detached from a man and one tries to have it surgically re-attached, to which the doctor mentions during the operation ""almost doesn't seem worth it"".Teeth doesn't really have much of a climax, or a story. It follows this one girl as she turns from a scared virgin to a slut dealing out death by Vagina Dentata. If your curious to see the flick, give it a go. If anything of this disgusts you, give it a skip.",Teeth
42,moviewizguy,Every rose has its thorns.,7,15 June 2010,"Dawn lives the life of a normal suburban teenager, except for the two nuclear reactors looming over her house. A goody two-shoes by any measure, she leads the local chapter of a chastity group, lecturing younger children on saving themselves for marriage. She finds herself stirred in unexpected ways, however, by new member Tobey. Dawn lets herself get closer to him than she has to anyone else, but when he rapes her, she discovers---in the most grisly way---that she is a true incarnation of the vagina dentata myth. As Dawn attempts to come to terms with her emerging sexuality and her second set of choppers, more men with bad intentions fall victim to their worst nightmare.One word that came up in my mind immediately after the end credits rolled was: Woah. There are things in here that you have never seen in any other film before. Whether that's a compliment or a criticism is up for you to decide. However, the film is oddly entertaining in a horrifically comedic way, if that makes any sense. There's a certain charming quality to it, a charm that makes it almost impossible to not like the film.Part of that charm comes from our protagonist, played by Jess Weixler. Weixler is such a sweet girl that she lights up the screen every time she's on, which is, fortunately, the majority of the film. Also, the horrific and graphic scenes dealing with the subject is impossible to resist. What happens in the film is so shocking, yet so absurd that the only thing you can possibly do in your situation is laugh and, by that, the film is truly hilarious and entertaining.Sure, some people may not like the feminist tone throughout the film or it's metaphorical stance on sex, but I was not bothered by them at all. I was too busy laughing and getting disgusted at the same time. I'm sure if you go in with the right mindset, TEETH can be a very rewarding experience. It was for me!",Teeth
43,bkrauser-81-311064,Teeth Could Have a Little More Bite,6,10 January 2014,"Is it easy to assume that Teeth (2007) is the best film of its subject matter? I don't just mean a story about a young woman with a very biting problem in her nether region but probably the best anti-horror film ever made, or at least in recent memory. The film stars Jess Weixler as the aforesaid young woman Dawn. Leader of the local community's Abstinence club and overall awkward teenager, Dawn takes care of her sick mother (Vivienne Benesch) with the help of her doting stepfather (Lenny von Dohlen) and the non-help of her stepbrother Brad (John Hensley). But all is not well as she slowly discovers her sexuality with temptation in the form of Tobey (Hale Appleman) her hunky Christian ""friend"". When she discovers she has a very eunuch-ly troubling affliction, her sexual awakening has a casualty or two.I say anti-horror movie because horror movies, at least in the classical sense are anti-feminist. Both sexes are tortured and killed in the genres most popular fare to be sure, but women are often times given one of two designations; the slut or the virginal survivor. Essentially the major female characters are defined not by what they can bring to the table but by their sexuality. Any woman not defined by those labels is filler and if you're unlucky enough to be the slut, you're punished for the crime of being sexually active on screen.In Teeth, the tropes are turned on their head. Much like Simone Simon's character in Cat People (1942), Dawn is a woman chained by the guilt of her sexual feelings. She positions herself in the abstinence crowd as a form of escape but is only further enticed to act upon her impulses. She's a female character that is refreshingly complex and goes through a realistic yet drastic character change throughout the course of the movie.Perhaps if the men in her life didn't act so foolishly and didn't take advantage of her vulnerability, things could have gone a little differently. As it stands there are no redeemable male characters other than maybe the stepfather. Even then there was a subtle undertow of unrequited sexual tension. I did feel bad for the gynecologist but he was acting a little unprofessionally.Aesthetically speaking the cinematography is too morose for its subject matter. Had the film been in the hands of Bryan Forbes or even John Waters, things might have been purposely funny instead of unintentionally so. It didn't help that the musical score provided by Robert Miller was way, way, way too on the nose. Lest I be impassive by castration, the music blares in grandiloquent tones as if to say look how shocking this moment is! I suppose I'm just not clear of the director's motivations with this film. Is it meant to be a feminist critique of the horror genre told by a teenager with a wicked smile and a sideways Chelsea grin to match? If so, is it meant to be taken seriously? One thing is for sure; while young women are told the chaste cautionary tales of Snow White and Red Riding Hood, young men may one day be told similar horror stories about the dreaded vagina dentata.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Teeth
44,fntstcplnt,Teeth (2007),7,19 January 2020,"Directed by Mitchel Lichtenstein. Starring Jess Weixler, John Hensley, Hale Appleman, Ashley Springer, Josh Pais, Lenny Von Dohlen, Vivienne Benesch, Julia Garro. (R)Under constant threat of sexual leering and assault, virginal teen Dawn (Weixler) discovers she has a rather potent means of defending herself--let's just say that her pearly whites can come out even when she's not smiling. Kitschy, kinky comedy with horror overtones satirizes purity ring promises and sends up feminist revenge thrillers with grisly aplomb; weaker-hearted viewers (especially males) may find it too tough to watch at times, but at least Dawn's victims all have it coming--arguably, the only ""decent"" guy in the whole picture is Von Dohlen as the diffident dad. Weixler's slyly restrained and disarming performance is central to its success, though the premise is more interesting than the execution--there's nothing tricky to the winking female empowerment maneuvers in the second half, and the climax (or should it be called a ""non-climax"" because of the gruesome interruption?) is telegraphed from the get-go. It's actually too bad the movie still mostly works, because the criticism puns are all so easy (""surprisingly toothless gross-out comedy,"" ""the Vagina Yawn-ologues,"" ""it bites!"" etc.).66/100",Teeth

47,ElijahCSkuggs,Toothy blowjobs don't seem so bad now.,8,30 March 2008,"On a whim and with some luck, I happened to discover that Teeth was playing at a nearby Arty Fartsy movie theater. So after coming to the conclusion I like teeth and vaginas, I decided it was best for me to go. And if you're like me and enjoy the myth that is Vagina Dentata (google it), this is a must see.Heading into Teeth I really had no clue what it was about. Well, besides that it revolved around Vagina Dentata. I didn't know if it was some Troma-type flick, or some graphically strong take on this freak myth. What you get is a slight mix of both. Teeth tells the story of super-duper abstinent hero, Dawn, who coincidentally is living proof that Vagina Dentata does exist. Focusing on Dawn's struggle with her hormones, horny boys, a crazy brother and a sick mother, the movie remains consistently entertaining through-out.The movie overall is very silly, even corny at times. But at the same time it's hitting you with social commentary and messages galore. And more often than not, they're pretty damn amusing. Some of you may not find it funny since most of the humor is very ""In your face"". But the majority of you will definitely find this sh!t really funny.Teeth turned out to be one of the best horror/comedies I've seen. Unfortunately it does not show the Vagina Dentata, which was a disappointment. And occasionally the acting seems a little too hammy, but with the vibe this movie gives off, this is of little to no concern. And I must say, the direction, music and cinematography was also very well done. If you're even mildly interested in the subject of Vaginas with Teeth, this is something you should check out. For a great double- header watch this and Killer Pussy.",Teeth
48,jaredmobarak,Now show me yours  Teeth,3,26 February 2010,"What's the best way to get out from underneath your famous father's shadow? How about write and direct a film about a teenager afflicted with vagina dentata? Yeah, that should do the trick. Mitchell Lichtenstein, son of famed Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, deciding to delve into feature film with the horror/comedy Teeth certainly thought so. It is definitely unlike anything I've ever seen and uniquely original, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. Besides the premise being inventive and the second half of the film eliciting some genuine laughs, I kind of disliked this whole crazy affair. I'm guessing that the acting was intentionally amateurish, but even so, the story itself is weak and under-developed. It might have been effective as a short film, ridding itself of the very laborious first act that crawled along, unsure of whether it wanted to make us laugh, and therefore seeming unintentionally funny rather than purposely subversive. More uncomfortable than anything else, I never knew exactly how to take what was happening on screen until it was almost over.Lichtenstein seems to want to give us some back-story into the psyche of Dawn O'Keefe, a young woman who has no idea what makes up a normal vagina. Her school system is Puritanical to the point where a huge starred circle covers the necessary diagram to enlighten her on its page of the Health book and it appears that she almost believes her 'affliction' is something all girls go through. Taking a vow, or I should say promise, of celibacy until marriage, it is as if once her plastic red ring is replaced by a golden band, the teeth lying hidden away inside her genitalia will dissolve, allowing her to continue living just like anyone else. Admittedly, the brouhaha surrounding its release in 2007 made me aware of what was actually happening to the lead victim/villainess, so it only took the early flashback of Dawn and soon-to-be stepbrother Brad in a blow-up swimming pool to understand the intricacies of her condition. To then go through forty-five minutes of her being chaste and innocent only made me impatient for the horrors that its billing sold me on. Maybe the exposition is relevant to believe the evolution from naïve schoolgirl to preying mantis, but it doesn't excuse the plodding pacing used to explain it all.Then there is the very heavy-handed work in pretty much every facet of the work. It could be the fact I was still wondering whether I was supposed to be laughing or not, but the music cues are so cheesy. On the most innocuous moments that only hold a sense of danger because we know what sort of evil lies between Dawn's legs, you will hear a menacing percussive note to inflict a sense of horror film dread. Being inside the joke, however, makes the punctuation more tongue-in-cheek joke than any sort of jarring sense of anticipation. As for visually, we are inundated constantly with the visage of two black smoke pumping nuclear power plant silos in the distance. We get it man—the chemicals and radiation mutated her mother's egg and created the man-eating gene shown very effectively in a fun opening credit sequence. And there is also the unfortunate poor editing transitions. Some are so abrupt you begin to wonder why Lichtenstein even showed the scene before as a few five minute set-pieces do nothing to add to the plot except give one more messed up moment in this demented world.Once the story gets moving, though, when Dawn finally sees what her weapon can truly accomplish, the laughs become confident and the enjoyment factor increases greatly. It is just a little too late. Jess Weixler is left to languish in mediocrity for the first two-thirds, playing the virgin too over-the-top and very ""One Tree Hill"" Clean Teen-like, especially being opposite the awkward performance from Hale Appleman as her boyfriend Tobey. When the two are together there is absolutely no sexual tension because their stares and deep breathing and uncertainty overpower any connection. Rather then want the two to be together and see her lash out in fear, we just wait and watch, hoping that she will eventually draw blood. That is why anyone would bother with the film anyway  to satisfy their bloodlust in an interesting way they have never seen before. Josh Pais's gynecologist helps bring the story into this genre territory with a hilariously funny moment of karmic beauty for the sexual abuser he is and soon Dawn becomes in control of her bodily actions. This is when Weixler shines, the perfect mix of innocent country girl with an edge of malice and a vengeful heart against the male sex. It is this later work that makes me second-guess what I initially thought was horrible acting at the start.John Hensley's Brad tries his best to make the beginning tolerable, but even his psychopath can't do it alone. The first victim of Dawn's at such an early age he doesn't remember the incident that scarred his index finger—""I think she bit me,"" is all he can conjure up—the guy's mental instability is fully formed. Adamantly refusing natural intercourse with his girlfriend, we can assume it is due to the deep rooted, subconscious fear of teeth being where they shouldn't be, even though he appears to tell himself that he is saving it for a long awaited chance at his stepsister. Tattooed, pierced, and very funny in his ability to be just plain mean, his comic relief is all that saves the film to eventually reach its stride with monster unleashed. Only then is the fun sustained with Teeth's pure absurdity and much more graphic gore moments than anticipated. You do get to see the aftermaths of Dawn's dentata flourishes, so be prepared. Or just avoid the film completely and hope Lichtenstein's sophomore effort, Happy Tears, fares better.",Teeth
49,MrGKB,Biting off more than it can chew...,6,6 September 2009,"...writer/director Mitchell ""My dad was famous"" Lichtenstein's ""Teeth"" falls into that genre of horror/fantasy dominated by the likes of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Fido,"" only the focus is on the empowerment of females rather than the anarchy of zombie masses. It's a far superior realization than wretched forebearers like ""Penetration Angst,"" which tackles the same theme with much less grace and style, even if ultimately it rises no higher than flawed works like ""Zombie Honeymoon"" or ""Hack!"" Still, it's worth a watch, if only to enjoy the efforts of rising new talent in the person of Jess Weixler, the toothsome lead.DP Wolfgang ""Brüno"" Held's camera-jockeying is quite good, Robert ""Trumbo"" Miller's score is equally assured and apt, and production values all around are quite nice for a relatively low budget film. No, one can't overly fault the technical craft that went into ""Teeth."" The culprit that keeps this one from being a genuine classic, even only a cult classic, is the earnest but uneven script.After an effective prologue that leaves no doubt as to our heroine's unique contraceptive abilities, ""Teeth"" takes too long getting to the meat of its story, much more than Syd Field would approve, and when it does get there--to the meat, that is--it veers wildly into gorehound territory, altering the entire tone of the piece, losing what little tension or suspense it may have had. ""Teeth"" wants to be taken seriously, but can't help its own decidedly masculine, adolescent underpinnings. It exploits the castration anxieties, inferiority complexes, and the latent misogyny of its target audience well, but fails to deal in any significant way with how its ostensible heroine feels about all this.Various plot holes go unresolved; questions that inevitably arise from the premise are ignored. How did this innocent get through life without *ever* being aware of her nether teeth? How has she avoided the various medical exams that accompany growing up? The whole subplot of purity vows and the like is little more than a smokescreen; this just isn't the way real people behave. The parents are convenient cardboard stereotypes and would have been better written out entirely. I'll leave Constant Reader to discover other nonsensical problems; they're more than obvious to anyone who thinks about them.So, upshot: worth a watch, but not nearly as clever as you might otherwise think or hope.",Teeth

51,juliankennedy23,Teeth... entering triumphantly leaving diminished,5,18 November 2009,"Teeth: 5 out of 10: This is the second vagina dentata film I have seen; it is unfortunately the lesser effort. This despite tremendous guerilla marketing campaign that could make one think this is the first cinematic foray into such a taboo subject let alone the greatest horror film since “Sliced: The Baker of Bread”.The film spends its first half an hour on a lightweight parody of the Teen Chastity movement complete with the wearing of red rings to show that they are pledged virgins. In a creepy post release twist, the chastity group is called Promise and uses something that resembles the Obama presidential red O as its symbol. I am not sure this is what the Obama campaign had in mind.After a half an hour of jabs at the religious right and nuclear power, (Cooling towers are ominously and unscientifically billowing black smoke behind our protagonist’s house.) The film segues into the feminist revenge film we all paid good money for.Needless to say, hormones being what they are, the dentata enabled virgin (Jess Weixler) finds herself getting hot and heavy with her born again virgin boyfriend (Hale Appleman). When he takes her no to mean yes and attempts to date rape her... well her teeth go to work and Appleman finds himself short one manhood.Do remember that film when the guy loves the girl and she betrays him so he cuts her vagina with a broken beer bottle, killing her, and the audience cheers him on? No? I don’t either. Because they never made that film... and if they did, audiences would burn down the theater. Welcome to the double standard. And don’t get me wrong, I approve of this particular double standard in theory, but the misandry of this film is overwhelming. Add in some unsubtle homosexual subtext (and gratuitous male nudity both membered and dismembered) and one gets the idea that the film is against heterosexual intercourse in general. This ironically gives it the same moral compass as the Chastity Group it mocks. This is simply forced chastity from the other side.The problem is poor direction by Mitchell Lichtenstein. His tone is all over the place and sloppy. If he wants his protagonist to seek out lovers then kill them for imagined slights (as she does later in the film) shouldn’t the film reflect this change from victim to predator? Director Lichtenstein also wastes a tremendous performance by John Hensley as Weixler’s older, evil brother. Hensley creates a character of true banal evil. A stupid selfish bad guy that feels like a very real person. His scenes are the best in the film, yet the climatic denouement is simply more of the same and honestly does not feel true to the character. (This would have been a perfect time for the film to put in a twist such as incestuous anal sex.) The films performances are overall quite good with Jess Weixler and Hensley as the standouts. The film is also extremely graphic with various male gentalia being sliced and gaping bloody wounds in the crotch area. (Not for nothing but would not a male member lose its erection if severed?) Unfortunately, Teeth, much like that recent killer baby flick Grace, ends where it should have begun. If you want to see a Vagina Dentata film done right, take a gander at Angst (Or Penetration Angst, as it is known overseas.). Fiona Horsey brings a certain je ne sais quoi to the art of dismembering men that an American virgin just cannot compete with.",Teeth

Even the most brutal film gore is tolerable if the story is intelligent or if it is interesting, Teeth is neither.The problem with Teeh is that it is a stupid movie which thinks it is an intelligent black comedy. The speeches about abstinence and evolution are done with a wink in their eye as if the filmmakers are trying to say ""Look aren't we clever"" Fans of this film tend to say it is a cunning satire for growing up, but I really think that the teens in this story are so far fetched to begin with that we can't even identify with them even on a suspended belief level.Our heroine lacks any real character development or arch. She is portrayed as the ultimate abstinence proponent but she is quick to give up her virginity.(The scene is meant to look like rape but we know she secretly wanted this) After being mortified by killing her would be boyfriend and ripping off the digits of her gyencologist, Dawn has no problem with having sex with a cliché teen she wasn't even friends with. Eventually she decides to punish her half-brother who is one of the most horribly written characters in recent horror films. We are supposed to find it funny that this jerk has his pierced penis eaten by a dog like a frank but really even though this Brad was little more than a shaved ape I felt sorry for him. After doing this Dawn leaves her home and is about to make love to an old man. Our ending leaves us to believe that Dawn will become a seductress and that she now enjoys her condition.Despite the fact that Dawn is a poorly developed character I cannot completely condemn Teeth our her character simply because of the performance by Jess Weixler. She gives 110% to this role and her performance succeeds despite the weak material. Credit must be given where credit is due. Maybe the film would have been somewhat better if the rest of the casting had been as good. Hale Applemen looks like he's staring into space and stoned for the whole movie",Teeth
55,elicopperman,A Unique Take on the Horror Genre That I Will Never Watch Again,6,24 June 2018,"In 2008, Roadside Attractions and Lionsgate released a very refreshing take on the horror movie genre called Teeth, though it originally premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. While it didn't do so well financially due to a limited release, it did receive a positive reception from critics, and it has garnished a cult following, mainly for how subversive of a movie it is. As for me, while I do consider it a very intriguing watch, I don't think I want to see it again.The essential story centers on a high-school chastity club member named Dawn who upon meeting a young man named Tobey is about to be raped by him. However, upon damaging Tobey's private area, Dawn discovers that she has a vagina dentata myth, when the encounter takes a grisly turn. That may sound disturbing enough in concept, but just imagine viewing the film in its full R rated glory. While not quite as vulgar as one might assume, the curse of Dawn's privates further adds into her own life. Considering that there are plenty of people in the movie who want to deflower her, including her own stepbrother Brad, her curse soon becomes easier for her to control and use. Even though it's never really explained how she obtained the dentata outside of an ancient Greek myth, the film still treats Dawn's curse as an omen, especially when it comes to her trying to adjust to womanhood, her being forced out of her chastity club, and her dilemmas of encountering sex craved perverts, making her the most endearing character in the whole film.The remaining characters on the other hand are either decent but underdeveloped or just plain despicable (for the right reasons of course). Dawn's father and step mother are definitely very caring and even strict when it comes to Brad, but they aren't really given enough screen time to stand out. Brad is an absolute scumbag given his careless attitude and horrid desire to bang Dawn, and lets just say his comeuppance is way more disturbing than what happens to Tobey. In addition to Tobey who's mainly just another abstinent teen who loses it with his hormones, another teen who ends up seducing Dawn named Ryan does gain the same results, but the execution is much more comedic and well deserved, though the humorous effect is done intentionally. One scene where Dawn gives the same fate to a violating doctor is supposed to be scary, but the execution makes it more silly than anything.With all that said, as much as I understand the tone of the film, this is not the kind of movie I would demand a repeat viewing for. Sure, the dark comedic tone does work in the movie's favor (whether intentionally or unintentionally), the effects work looks great given the low budget, and the feminist angle is certainly more tasteful than I Spit on Your Grave (don't look that up). However, I found the movie way too straight forward and even the very end felt a little underwhelming, as if we'll never get to see the parents again and we'll never even know about Dawn's future. Also, this movie can get really disturbing (I mean, we actually see the D on screen), and if you're very sensitive to gore, don't even bother with this. Overall, while I admire the movie for what it is and I would definitely recommend it to those seeking out original and even mythical takes on the horror genre, this was just a one and done deal for me personally.",Teeth

She meets a boy just as devout, just as pure, and everything seems perfect, until well....""Vagina Dentatta it's REAL!"" screams a maimed gynecologist as he bleeds from his hand all over his white coat. Yes the film jumps between moments of sincerity and tongue in cheekiness, but does so surprisingly well. The myth of vagina dentatta is as the film says, one which can be found in texts from early Christians, Greeks, Egyptians, papa new Guenna, native Americans, etc all concerning a young male hero who conquers an evil demon women. ""Teeth"" follows one girls story and manages to capture sexual development and awakening in all it's primal terror, the loathing, hatred, fear, shame, excitement, lust is all there, while in the film's class rooms vagina's have been removed from text-books so as not to offend modesty. I'll be honest I didn't expect this to be anything but a ""Trauma"" movie(Toxic Avenger), and was really surprised and impressed, and oddly moved by this. It's gory and not for weak of stomach, but it strikes an ancient primordial nerve(what the Decent did for dark, deep, cramped, hell holes, this film does for the historically terrifying mysteries between womens legs). Not for everyone but horror comedy fans will enjoy a good does of each, and a helpful peppering of unconscious male and female sexual anxieties. A perfect Midnight Movie.",Teeth
57,ClaytonDavis,Something to sink your TEETH into...,6,27 May 2008,"A new evolution of horror as arrived with the new film, Teeth. Teeth tells the story of Dawn O'Keefe (Jess Weixler), a young abstinent teenager who comes to find out that her ""family jewels"" are much more special than everyone else's; her vagina has teeth. When she comes to realize her ""differences"" she starts to battle with her sexuality and wanting to act on her impulses.This has definitely revolutionized the horror genre along with some awkward comedy, Teeth holds interest for the viewer throughout. From a woman's perspective I'm not sure how the film would be received, but from a man, to put it plainly simple, it scares the ever living crap out of me. The film holds nothing to the imagination as it shows the most graphic images I've seen on film in quite sometime.Other than graphic imagery, the storyline isn't as strong as images. There's no flow to the story and pretty random at times as it conquers the steps of gross and unfortunate adolescence. The performances are enough to suffice but its John Hensley who plays Brad, Dawn's perverted step-brother who wants to take his sister's virginity that stands out. Young Dawn takes on some new attitudes throughout the film and Weixler attends to her with grace and ease.Not sure if this is a must-see for people, but it compares to The Matrix scenario when Morpheus presents the red pill and the blue pill. You can take the blue pill, the dream ends and you can believe whatever you want to believe; you take the red pill, you get to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.**½ /****",Teeth

60,Seamus2829,Ouch!,9,6 April 2008,"This slight film works on several levels. First, it flexes the proverbial middle finger at ""abstinence only"" cults that target young people, in hope that they'll embrace a hypocritical religion that claims to be above it all (which is actually never mentioned in this film, but you know where I'm going). Next, it acts as a VERY black comedy treatment of low budget,cheese fest films (generally cast with no name casts of mostly non professionals,as with this film),and lastly acts as a revenge epic (with a very feminist twist). The plot concerns Dawn, an attractive young lass with an extra set of razor sharp teeth, much further south than the other ones (okay, I'll say it...her vagina). I don't think I would ever view this as a date film,but it would work as a midnight cult film (if somebody out there decided to bring that medium back). It will remind some of those low/no budget schlock feasts that studios like Troma crank out.",Teeth
61,Cinema_Fan,Flossing never seemed so exciting. Until we were shown the Teeth.,3,20 June 2008,"At least with ""Ginger Snaps"" (2000) it had some underlined metaphor for puberty, but this? If there were some hidden agenda for female growing-pains then, sadly or quite rightly, I missed it here. What promised to be an interesting story has only turned out to be a film with more caps attached, to cover its dreadful ham-fisted delivery, than an A-Lister at a photojournalist convention.There were comic tensions to be seen, but the timing was all out of place, it just seemed ""so wrong"", wrong in the sense that it falls flat, continually, and this is trying too hard and failing miserably, hearing that pin drop never relieved the embarrassment of a poorly executed film. With such an interesting concept this has been glossed over as a comedy, sadly, the only comic relief here is the fact that these inserts seem to be wanting to be taken seriously.Being fully aware of the predicament that our young protagonist, Dawn (Jess Weixler, born 1981), is under and her determination to save her most sacred moment, this does at least have its moments too. We see these young adults trying hard not to give into temptation, and with this chosen life style, we see them sullen and with great restraints comes great responsibility and pressure, all due respect and fair enough. The gap between serious overtones of ones belief and the way in which it is handled is wide. A seriously funny film or a funny film of serious consequence? Yes, we have the wanting and the lustful thoughts of these everyday kids shown before us, but to choose the method in which this cross-over from child to adult has been a wasted opportunity.Attempting to extract a laugh, except for a roll-of-the-eyes cringe, never came, yes, a dog that eats a man severed member is funny, is amusing and ""Ouch"" comes to mind, fair play. Sadly, though, this is no deep cavity of either horror or comedy. Gross-out and tacky is all we get for our money, this film was not done in the Private Sector but with a State Handout, and with a State Handout, it's harder to go and ask for your money back, but easier to see why you didn't want to go in the first place.",Teeth

64,revival05,One of the best and most original horror films of the last decade,8,10 May 2010,"Teeth is one of the best horror films I've seen from the last decade. Its great because it transcends it's genre, its great because its about many things at the same time, its great because it is both macabre and bizarre and its also great because its absolutely hilarious. I simply loved this film. Its also great because it could have been so much worse in so many ways. I'm thinking of two alternative ways in which this film could have gone down a wrong turn. First of all, both plot wise and aesthetically its dangerously close to the American Indie Film ideal as I like to call it. That is to say films being quirky for the sake of being quirky, ending up more or less pointless and tiring - I'm not being scientific here, I really mean just about any film with pop music and catch phrases instead of dialog and acting, from Ghost World and Napoleon Dynamite to Kick-Ass and The 500 Days of Summer. I'm not saying these are all horrible films. But none of them are as good as they could have been.Another, more obvious, thing this film could be is a sleazy exploitation movie that could have been more or less amusing but nothing else. Oh, I haven't mentioned what this film is about yet, have I? It's about Dawn, a suburban American Midwest high school girl who's a proud and shining member of ultra-Christian organisation ""The Promise"", promoting the importance of purity. Thou shalt not touch thyself, nor ""unwrap your gift"" until you meet someone special. However, Dawn is of course only human and have long nights when she lies awake in bed moaning ""What's wrong with me? Purity! Purity! Purity!"" What she doesn't know is that her gift is a little unusual. It's called ""vagina dentata"" and, let's not linger on this any more, basically she's got jaws in her holy garden. One of many funny things in the film is that Dawn discovers this phenomena as any teenager discovers his or hers sexuality in general; gradually, first with fear and anxiety and, eventually, with a enthusiasm and a great sense of power and self- fulfilment. Yes, this is truly a coming-of-age story. One of the best ones I've seen in years, in fact.For a good forty minutes or so, Teeth isn't even a horror film. It's a satirical, comedic drama about young people troubled with religious guilt having no choice but to go with their cravings. It's even, I'd say, both amusing and gripping. You feel for Dawn, wonderfully played by Sundance Award-winner Jess Weixler, and her poor friends, some of which won't survive the shock of unknowingly trying to deflower a carnivore plant. When they go to the movies, they stare at the theatre in disappointment. ""Aw, it's Rated R!"" one of them say. ""But even the PG-13 ones will have hardcore make-out scenes"" Dawn dutifully points out. Their only choice is to see a Disney film.Dawn's journey, however, is one from childhood to adulthood. Herein lies the brilliance of Teeth. Like all great horror films it deals not only with fears that are deeply rooted in the human psyche - not without a great deal of Freudian twists - but also with the chores of puberty and the bridge between the teenage years and the adult world. The great moment of the film is when Dawn begins to realise that her 'teeth' work at her will. While being on top of a properly disgusting guy who happily admits that he's only doing her for the sake of a bet with a friend, she looks at him in baffled anger when - snap - and she goes ""Aw bleep"" and leaves him in a pool of castrated whatever-you-had-it-coming-blood.Much like in Brian De Palma's horror classic Carrie, the young inexperienced and suppressed female lead learns to fight back on her bullies with a nasty supernatural habit. Writer-director Mitchell (son of Roy) Lichtenstein certainly has made a film with a lot more humor. This is understandable, I guess, since there is naturally something both very silly and quite effective with the premise of a toothed vagina. It's apparently a take on an old myth, based on male fear of sex and female sexuality. Uh-huh. It may be an inappropriate thing to claim, but I seriously doubt any male viewing of this film not including one or two quite violent cringes. But, once again like all great horror films, its a lot of bloody fun; even more so when you know that you are affected by something that rings very true.We don't get to know exactly where Dawn's ""gift"" comes from, but chances are they might have something to do with the ominous chemical plant spewing out smoke stacks in the back of Dawn's suburban row of houses. While he's at it, Lichtenstein even manages to get the most subtle of apocalyptic hints in there too. He might be saving this for a sequel, but something tells me he's too classy for that. All in all, there's not much to complain about here. An absurd, intelligent, scary, funny, very good film.",Teeth
65,RockPortReview,Horrific and Funny - A Great Mix!,8,27 January 2011,"Teeth 8/23/2010""Teeth"" is a funny and not to subtle message to the male gender around the world. It is based on the age old cautionary tale of Vagina Dentata. The story about an innocent young girl with a vicious set of chompers between her legs. It is a story that has been told for centuries by many cultures not only warning young people of the dangers of sex, but also to discourage rape and promiscuity. Mitchell Lichtenstein is the writer/director with the cohunes to bring this story to the screen in a funny, cringe inducing way. Dawn O'Keefe is played perfectly by Jess Weixler, a girl who has had to deal with this abnormality all her life. This type of story, like the movie ""Ginger Snaps"" (which I reviewed earlier), is also a clear comment on female puberty and there burgeoning sexuality.Dawn is an outspoken advocate for abstinence and gives lectures to young school kids to wait until marriage. When she starts seeing a guy from school they try to take it slow, but since he is a guy he pushes her beyond her boundaries. When things start to get to serious her body reacts and he loses an important part of his anatomy. Although the premise is a little ridiculous, it is still quite an entertaining experience. As she starts to learn more about her body, she begins to take back some control over her life. Her first visit to the gynecologist is an absolute laugh riot. Dawn always seems to be surrounded by the creepiest guys who want only one thing. Come on were not all like that! Ryan finally enters the picture to redeem the male gender and tame her teeth. Is he up to the task or will he just be another loser? This is a great date movie for open minded couples. Check it out!",Teeth

Teeth could've been executed so much better given its propensity for amazing shock value but its mythological roots was married too clumsily with modern-day black humor. Writer/director Mitchell Lichtenstein should've learned a thing or two from someone who has perfected this combo, Joss Whedon.Dawn (Jess Weixler) is an abstinence advocate who is privately torn with battling her own awakening teenage desires. It doesn't help that her home situation is crazy: despite having the quintessential loving parents, her stepbrother Brad (John Hensley from Nip/Tuck) is the complete opposite. And, yes, discovering that her vagina has teeth.The exposition is slow; the plot is super thin; really painful to watch till the end.

It's about a girl who suffers from Vagina dentata and any male who tries to impregnate her runs the risk of losing a vital part of his anatomy. Sound like a winner?"" Of course, there is more to it than that, though only a little, as we follow our heroine Dawn O'Keefe as she struggles to come to terms with her unusual anatomical addition. Quickly she learns that there are two sides to the condition, one positive, one negative. When indulging in a spot of the old intercourse willingly, all seems fine, though she is always fearful that she will lose control and cause a nasty accident. Also when a male tries to take her by force, she has the capacity to dish out a most unexpected punishment.Off beat and quirky, though not in any way wacky this, in tone at least, is reminiscent of Juno, with black comedy at its heart. With occasional moments of abject horror, and a delicious waft of sadism, this is schizophrenic though controlled movie making, and a genuine breath of fresh air from the oft sterile Hollywood studios.Recommended.",Teeth

I can't believe my own two eyes this is hands-down the craziest thing I saw on film this year..so far.So basically, we have Dawn, the heroine of the film. She is a high school student who vows to keep her purity until she is married. But then, a male friend takes advantage of her inside a cave (Yes, a cave) and from this point on, it all goes freakishly (delightful) until the end. You wanna look away from the screen but you can't because somehow you are compelled to watch the events that will unfold. One thing that I liked about this film is the innovation that it brings to the horror genre. They took the ""F'ed Up"" genre to a whole new another level.The lead female, Jess Weixler is destined to be a star. Acting is in her blood she reminds me of a Gothic-tattooed Angelina Jolie. Angie started her film career doing nudity and tackling sensitive topics on film and now she has become an international star whose latest film is award winning and widely acclaimed (A Mighty Heart). That's where Jess (I think) is headed. According to IMDb, she already have three upcoming films on her slate. I'll be seeing her sometime soon.This is a feminist film who depicts men as lustful horndogs yes but men need not fret. The film actually made a point. Women aren't just objects of sexual desire, all they need is love. Lust is secondary. (Oh yes, a quotable quote) ""Teeth"" is a breath of fresh air to the horror genre.

69,DustinRahksi,Degenerate,1,15 September 2013,"Short and sweet review You can tell from the opening scene this movie was going to be abusive, even the title alone spells it out. It opens with two young siblings in the pool, and look at title of film, there you can guess what happens.Fast forward to an overly comedic and hokey high school, where Dawn(Jess Weixler) is preaching about Chastity, that's iron towards the end of the film. So we see stupid people, and then there is some double standard BS, a whole lot of nothing. Dawn becomes attracted to some other guy in her group. So they meet at a watering hole to do the nasty. She changes her mind and he rapes her. What a nice film:). Turns out that was a bad idea, as he loses his manhood in quite a funny way. Those teeth are a hell of a defence mechanism. So she goes to the gynaecologist for some answers. You can tell a man created that occupation. So the guy loses his fingers while doing some flexibility test which I am pretty sure is inappropriate. Dawn is now stricken with guilt, so she goes to some guys house. She gets drugged, and is raped again. Don't worry, in the morning she is alright with it. It's strange how they hide her body all film, but then randomly show her breasts, then go back to hiding them. Anyway, turns out the guy was just using her as some kind of big game hunt, he gets his just deserves. The rest of the movie doesn't make any sense. She has sex with her brother, leaves town, and then unleashes the teeth on some pervert while hitch hiking. That's four people she had sex with in a matter of three days, so much for her Chastity morals, womp womp waahh.They film is just down right mean, every where Dawn goes, someone wants to rape her. How is that supposed to be entertaining, it's sick. The characters are complete trash, and degenerates. It's hard to make a comedy work, when it's about rape, don't you think.

70,keelhaul-80856,"Funny, but beyond stupid at times.",4,5 November 2017,"This film is one of those movies where you stop halfway through and think, ""WTF am I watching? and should I finish this?""Then, you realize you wasted this much time so far, so you take a couple more shots and keep watching to see how they wrap up this silliness. I suppose this film is much more of a black comedy than horror. Although, I was glad I had already gotten laid that night before watching this, as it isn't really a big turn-on LOL.Basically, though, it seems this movie was written by extreme feminists. If you notice, practically every man in the film is sleazy, a rapist, oblivious to female suffering, or a total psycho pervert. Her stepbrother wants to rape her(and only bangs girls in the butt, as he is still afraid of a childhood incident where his sister's vagina bit his finger), her crush rapes her, her ""hero"" that finally gets one off without being bitten inside her--well, turns out he is also a jerk who, for some dumb reason, tells her that he made a bet to bang her while she is still banging him. After disposing of him, she gets a creepy doctor who sticks his fingers in without gloves and so she takes his fingers off. The only male who doesn't fit the description of the Boston Strangler/Hitler in this film is perhaps her dad, who stands up to his weird son, but is nearly killed by the dog.Anyway, there are some really funny moments in this(the making fun of religious zealot promise ring retreats, guys who look like the Jonas brothers, the obvious shots of nuclear power plants directly behind the family home to hint about how the girl mutated, the rapist guy screaming ""I haven't jerked off since EASTER!!!"") However, there are some boring parts as well, and this movie comes off like ""Pumpkin"" with Christina Ricci-- it can't really decide what it wants to be, and leaves you with a pile of silly, concocted nonsense.

71,Simon_Says_Movies,Less than toothsome,5,3 December 2008,"Mitchell Lichtenstein's Teeth, is a perfect and depressing example of how a truly unique concept can be disastrously executed and hindered by its own direction and vision. Not withholding the aforementioned exceptionally standalone approach to the film, this picture chooses to tell its tale in a very hateful and disjointed manor.Teeth could be best caricaturized as a ""horror/dramedy"", although the humour is at times almost too subtle to deserve such a title. It is most certainly quirky, with a clear dose of political and cultural allegory and the characters drive this tone creatively and confidently throughout the film. The problem lies with the fact that this tone does not drive the message anywhere gripping. We are entered into a small town, were we meet the subtly lovely Dawn (Jess Weixler) who is an activist for abstinence. She lives with her bedridden mother (Vivienne Benesch), stepfather (Lenny von Dohlen) and step-brother (Jon Hensley). Her parents both admire her strength and passion, which is more then they can say for their son Brad, who is a pot-smoking, cheating, violent sociopath. But when young Dawn begins to flirt with the notion of an amorous relationship (she has never even touched her nether regions) she finds something that nobody should ever discover about their self; Vagina Dentate. (Yes it is as literal as you may think; vaginal teeth) Her lower set of pearly whites, begin their sometimes accidental and sometimes purposeful reign of terror on her unsuspecting male companions. She tries to cope with the guilt, and tries to discover exactly what she can do to stop the mythological phenomenon.As you can clearly see, this is not a cinematic concept that had been openly explored before, but this is unfortunately almost all of the charm of this film. Aside from the solid performances, it constantly journeys into uneasiness and hatefulness, as if the directors main moral could no longer resist the restraints of the film, and finally erupts into a full scale vendetta against men. I am not trying to insinuate that women should be unable to express themselves in a bold fashion, but the way in which this material is presented, shifts to making the female lead into a very unlikable heroine.The number of full frontal scrotal severance scenes almost defeat, and certainly outnumber that of Hostel: Part II, and as the narrative progresses, this hatred becomes less warranted and more frequent. Additionally, I believe I can safely assume very few people would actually enjoy watching mutilation of this nature, aside from actually finding some societal punctuality from it. Withholding these scenes, any paraxial or backhanded message that is trying to be presented is by no means fully realized and does not deliver any memorable or insightful morals. The message of abstinence is forfeited after the female lead engages, the moral of love and monogamy is overshadowed by pity for the male actors and the film itself is skewed by such a low-key and uneventful aura, that it fails to bring forth any prominent emotions but disgust.It is most certainly a shame to see such a favourable and original concept presented to such little avail, despite strong performances and writing. As soon as the plot of this film was revealed to me I was intrigued, and viewing the end results I have no hesitation of labelling this picture the biggest disappointment of the year. In the end, Teeth, has about as much bite as an old man gnawing on a marshmallow and its lasting power leaves something to be desired. This less than toothsome film is a DVD rental at best, and simply is a disjointed and uneventful fable.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",Teeth

Its all very subtle but with the obvious subject matter for the film it made it even more funny. It has a bit of gore but has zero tense moments. All the Men in this film are portrayed as horny desperate and undersexed, so yeah they make ideal victims. Overall its a comedy, some of it subtle some of it slapstick and its a horror also but in the loosest sense. Some of the acting in this film is really good and some is really bad. All the acting though is tongue in cheek and you have to be aware of this to get the most entertainment value.Funniest scene is with the gyno, I laughed a lot.",Teeth
75,austin-takahashi,Teeth (Quick Review) - 3 Stars,6,15 December 2012,"""Teeth"" is a movie about a set of teeth that is not located inside a mouth. It is also a movie where an exploitive gynecologist finds four of his severed fingers on the floor after they are brutally bitten off of his hand. And if you know what a gynecologist does, then you may have already discovered that the preceding occurrence is the work of a vagina with teeth. This will be identified as shocking for most of its viewers, but even more so for the stubborn men who try to take advantage of a pretty, slightly-mutated girl named Dawn.Multiple castrations are performed to strip men of their masculinity, but we must understand that this particular crime is passive in context. Do we ever see Dawn's genitals creep through the night and mutilate men while they're alone in peace? No. We realize that Dawn's ""additional teeth"" only attacks when it is first attacked, that it only causes violence when it is first violated.""Teeth"" is a movie that's bloody from the waist down. It targets men with impure and selfish motives against women. Those with methods more vicious than others are suggested to abstain not in respect, but in fear. In a scene where a man cries in pain in exchange for his perversity, the least he could hope for, with thoughts of reconstructive surgery in the future, is that Dawn's additional teeth is only there to bite, and not swallow.More reviews here: http://localmoviereview.com/",Teeth
76,greggman,Can't decide what it wants to be,5,31 March 2021,"The movie is nearly 100% serious until about the 55 minute point. The first point where it stops being serious is when she visits the doctor and his reaction is ridiculous. It was silly, and the stuff that followed immediately after so silly that I thought she was going to wake and and the visit had been a dream. That's not what happens though, it's not dream and the reactions of the rest of the people from that point on are not remotely serious.The movie needed to decide what it wanted to be. Camp and seriousness don't mix. The fact that they tried to mix them is what ruins what was an interesting premise.",Teeth

But they're not. Therefore, they knitted a horror film that shows men must see sexual intercourse as sacred, lest they want to lose their joysticks.Pretty and prim is the heroine Dawn O'Keefe (sweet, plain-faced Jess Weixler) a pro-abstinence teen spokesperson at her school. She wears a red plastic ring as a mark of chastity, but peer pressure and a sexy dream get to her. So, she falls in love with handsome Tobey (Hale Appleman, who looks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but their love soiree sadly turns into attempted rape.Emphasis on ""attempted"" because coitus becomes castration; Dawn's vagina cavity has teeth! The instant shocks her and TobeyI'll leave it to you to guess. Dawn even gets more freaked when she learns, via the Internet, the ancient lore of ""vagina dentata"", but the knowledge slowly empowers her. With her mom near death and her half–brother (John Hensley of ""Nip/Tuck"") a sadistic troublemaker, Dawn welcomes her gift/curse since all the guys that want to lay her are perverted jerks. God help all men. . .but why should He? Its' motif being anti-premarital sex, you'd think ""Teeth"" would be adored by social conservatives who pathetically cherished ""Juno"" and ""Knocked Up"" for their supposed anti-abortion plots but said individuals purposely overlook the profanity and hedonistic elements. It looks like the film's monstrous tone, under a tent of quaint, innocuous suburbia, is too much for them. Director-scribe Mitchell Lichtenstein (son of famous artist Roy) does a great,subversive job with that, assisted by D.P. Wolfgang Held. A winner for lead actress at the Sundance Film Festival, Weixler is virginal innocence and carnal demoniac combined and personified, while echoing Helen Hunt and Uma Thurman at the same time. She deserves a cable sitcom. As her half-sibling, Brad, Hensley is the polar opposite, a nihilist who screw his girlfriend anally, smokes weed and listens to thrash-metal rock, but is really a lost soul. Kudos must be given to Josh Pais (""Watching The Detectives"") as a gynecologist who gets too involved when clinically examining Dawn, and the outcome's priceless.Like the classic ""Carrie"", ""Teeth"" slyly blends the genres of horror, coming-of-age and female empowerment.

78,mary-179-677383,Lacking substance,2,9 May 2014,"Warning spoilers So in this movie the 'naive' Dawn is sitting in her bathroon soaking her high school text book page to take off the gold paper that was placed on the image of the female sexual organ. Why wouldn't she just look it up on the internet as she moments later starts looking up teethed vagina finds the name of her condition - as if it was a real thing and common. Oh the acting in that scene was one of the worst I've ever seen.She sees a doctor, who happens to start screaming out her condition after he lost 4 fingers in the examination. The doctor is not seen or heard of again. The police are not after her, it's as if nothing happened.Look the movie is too long, how much story line can you really achieve from this plot. This would make a perfectly fine 30 minute Tales of the Crept episode.The main character Dawn is initially shocked and disturbed by her ""curse"" and in her most 'scared state' runs to a guys house she barely knows rather than her female 'best' friend or to her father that she is very close with apparently.She then lets a guy sleep with her and says ""I can't believe you're not dead"" - so she was happy to risk sleeping with him to test the theory of finding a hero to rescue her vagina. She then starts enjoying sex, but this man turns out he didn't sleep with her because he liked her but to settle a bet, so the writers think he deserves his manhood cut off? Sure, he isn't a gentlemen but she knew him for a whole 5 minutes. I guess the story line is if you regret sleeping with someone then they should have their parts cut off. Hmm..Then, she figures well I've mutilated so many people without being caught why not my step brother. Now although her brother again not the nicest person in the world, but deserving of such punishment..hmm no. The movie takes a turn for the worse at this point. As the main character now uses sex as a weapon to get away with mutilation and murder. She becomes judge and jury. The writers were a bit confused as the Mum says ""were lucky to have both our kids"" at the start of the movie so she understands although her son has some issues he is young and she still loves him. That is ignored by the main character who blames her step-brother when her mum dies. Where was she when her mum was calling for help? Nice way to deflect blame. I could maybe understand the move if he murdered his mum.I am female and I felt bad for the male characters. I've watched a lot of movies where I've rooted for the ""good guy"" who kills and or tortures the bad guys, but these characters were not really 'bad enough' to justify the punishment and I guess I felt bad for them. Dawn is really the villain.Also the acting, writing and music was not really that good.",Teeth

But there's a far more interesting movie about V*gina Dentata waiting to be made.

80,rotildao,Foreplay!,8,14 May 2008,"I remember being among a group of 5 once (2 youngster couples + me), I was 26, the oldest in the group. We were talking about sexuality between men and women and I clearly remember most of them agreeing that oral sex and romanticism were filthy and old fashioned right after I told them ""you have to down on her"". So, except for one girl who smiled, I was the ""underdog"" there.I tell you, if ""men"" performed their sexual tasks properly with women from beginning of times, we wouldn't have Medusas with snakes in their heads or women with teeth in their vagina; however, there are no ""ifs"" in life, hence the good results of Teeth.The film is great through the waists point of view (remember the mustache invention picture?). Jess Weixler and John Hensley are simply perfect. And although the clichés of old horror flicks present in Teeth we must look at family and social issues with a Freudian perspective added with a bit of Greek mythology.Dawn is shown in a pool with her stepbrother, Brad, trying to stick his finger in her vagina as he is severely injured. Years pass and Dawn becomes a religious leader promoting ""chastity"" (or purity) before marriage for boys and girls. Dawn's mother is married with Brad's dad, and Brad actually is in a Cul-De-sac-platonic-incest with Dawn, so, in his fashion, he loves her. Their parents union makes Brad grow rebellious against the whole world.We have incest, step parents, sexual abuse by men on women added with partial Oedipus complex, and an angry girl with a Vagina Dentata.All these elements create a perfect story with huge doses of dark humor that will crack your jaws and make you reflect on social important issues without taking your attention off the screen. Some scenes will also creep some guys (it is inevitable) due to the friction of Weixler vagina, I mean, her teeth... oh well...Brilliant film, but not for all viewers!",Teeth

But then, female rapists of men would be an issue.At the end of the movie, the girl looked at the audience and smiled. The old pervert trying to take advantage of her is gonna have hell to pay. Yes the girl would use her secret weapon for self defence. But it does open up a whole new area.

82,Knewsense78,Makes Men Look Bad!,2,6 July 2009,"'TEETH' stars Jess Weixler as Dawn O'Keefe, a girl who has decided to stay pure until she is happily married. Dawn grows up all her life in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant, which would explain the ""teeth"" in her vagina. We get the idea when, in a scene earlier in the movie, Dawn and her step brother Brad (John Hensley) are in a pool together. Through his body actions, we know that he has exposed himself to her. ""I showed you mine now show me yours,"" he says. She does. His finger travels south. Chomp! The tip is almost bitten off.Cut to when Dawn is in her teens. ""Purity"" is the best thing for her and she preaches to other teens about the importance of remaining pure until you find your soul mate. Dawn likes Tobey (Hale Appleman) and he likes her. Dawn and Tobey go out but only with another couple so temptations to ""do the deed"" will remain low. Finally, they decide to go to a local swimming hole together. There is a waterfall with a cave behind it. They swam into the cave and climb out of the water. They start making out. Dawn wants Tobey to stop. Tobey really doesn't want to, saying that he hasn't masturbated in 3 months. Somehow the back of Dawn's head manages to get whacked off the rocks and she is knocked out. Now's Tobey's chance to get some action. He penetrates her. She comes to and realizes what is going on, trying to push him off from her. That's when it happens. Chomp! There goes Tobey's wiener. Tobey is completely deserving of getting his member chomped off cause he took advantage of Dawn while she was passed out and basically raped her. Tobey falls back into the water and Dawn gets the hell out of there. I think if I was a girl and realized that there was something unnatural about my vagina, I'd be out of there too.Dawn goes to see Dr. Godfrey (Josh Pais) so she can have her hoohaw examined. The doctor puts some lube on his fingers and proceeds to penetrate her with four of his fingers, saying stuff like, ""Oh, you're tight."" Chomp! There goes his fingers. When they are being reattached in surgery, he is asked by the surgeon, ""Are you sure you don't want to tell us how this happened?"" The doctor doesn't. How would he explain that? ""Oh, I was practically raping a girl with my fingers and her vagina bit them off."" He was deserving of this too.Dawn has sex with Ryan (Ashley Springer) and nothing happens. Could she finally have found the right person? Not quite. They have sex again, and, in mid sex, Ryan's phone rings. He answers it. This throws Dawn off. He starts talking with his friend on the other end. ""Yeah, I told you I would. I'm having sex with her right now."" Dawn asks who it is. Ryan answers and says that he had a bet with his friend whether or not he would have sex with Dawn. Chomp! There goes Ryan's wiener. This is probably the goriest part in the whole movie. Was Ryan deserving of having his wang chomped off by Dawn's monster vagina? You bet your ass.Dawn finally decides to use this to her advantage. She decides that she is going to have sex with her step brother cause he's wanted to have sex with her for the longest of times. They do the deed and...chomp! There goes his johnson. He stays in his bed, holding his mutilated junk. She stands in front of him, does a little move and his tally whacker falls out of her love tunnel and lands on the floor. His pit bull comes over and eats it up. Talk about giving the dog a bone. lol.Dawn decides to leave town. She catches a ride with an old man. She falls asleep. The old man pulls into a truck stop. Dawn wakes up and looks over at the old man. He his sticking his tongue in and out at her as if offering her oral sex. Dawn looks at the camera and smiles. And then the movie ends. One can only assume that the old man is gonna get his tongue working and then...chomp! Now, here is my problem with 'TEETH'. The subject matter with the men getting their willies chomped off by a toothed vagina does not bother me in the slightest. Yes, those scenes made me cringe but that was about it. My problem is that all the men in this movie are portrayed to be vile, disgusting pigs. Am I really suppose to believe that all of these men would be deserving to have their schlongs (etc...) chomped off? 5 men and they're all gonna be rapists and pervs? I highly doubt it.Perhaps writer and director Mitchell Lichtenstein should make a movie about a man with a spike for a penis and have the girls die once they are penetrated. Let's see how some of us would feel about that. If the girls were portrayed as ""rapists and pervs"" I'm sure their would be a lot of people who had a problem with the movie.",Teeth

The woman in question is not a monster, nor is she a victim, shes just someone who is aghast at the power her feminine parts have to sever the sexual appendage of any male who makes her angry.

85,maatmouse-1,Fear of female sexuality turns into black comedy,5,7 November 2008,"I wondered how long it would be before the film industry started mocking those who had decided to take vows of sexual abstinence (also called purity vows). This is such a film. Not only does it comment on the somewhat misdirected attempts to deal with young peoples sexuality but it also does throw in a nice line in the kind of grim humour which betrays the western world's problems with female sexuality.Poor Dawn has problems from the start. Not only does she have to deal with a half-brother from hell who seems intent on getting her involved in a very inappropriate relationship with him but also she discovers, somewhat late on, that she has a genetic abnormality. In short, Dawn has teeth in her most intimate place.Growing up in America, Dawn embraces the sex abstinence movement and is so good at it, she speaks at their youth conventions. Then she begins to take an interest, or rather a guy takes an interest in her. Such is his interest that they swim together and she discovers, rather horribly, that she has a secret weapon against rape by men. Unfortunately, it means the guy she is with, ends up losing the end of his male member.And so the film becomes predictable. After going to a rather bad gynaecologist who insists on testing for 'flexibility' (whatever that is about) and causing him to lose his fingers in the process, Dawn realises that she is having problems. The biggest of these problems is going to be losing her virginity without causing her lover/would be husband quite serious injury.There are several rather funny scenes in this film. The humour is a bit predictable. Pretty girl seems to only fall for rotten men and with it, echoes of Michael Winner's rather bad film about female revenge 'Dirty Weekend' which featured a similar 'all men are evil' tagline. None of the men in this film, young or old, come over as anything other than sex obsessed and exploitative. Brad, Dawn's nasty half-brother, is a scared oddball who plays with guns, keeps a rottweiler he calls 'Mother' and likes to have almost continuous sex with the women unfortunate enough to end up in his bed.This whole films plays like a 1970s style 'Carrie' type film combined with more than a bit of gore. Stay away from it if you are not keen on watching men having their most intimate details mutilated. Little is left to the imagination.",Teeth
86,carljessieson,Huge Disappointment,5,20 September 2010,"A young, purity-loving teen has teeth in her vagina. That's pretty much all you need to know. It's such an interesting premise! I remember the first time that I even heard of this movie, I was completely fascinated. I wanted to see it sooo bad! Honestly, though, it was disappointing. It should have been thrilling, intriguing, amazing! But it wasn't. It's such a bummer, because they had a such a cool idea, and then it just fell flat. See, it should be crazy when she bites with her downstairs teeth, but it was awkward and kinda boring. The director's presentation of their shock and horror is laughable and embarrassing. It ruins the whole scene. A few times throughout the film I wasn't sure if it was trying to be a teen comedy, or if it was trying to be a scary movie with occasional jokes. I still don't know what it was trying to be. The only times that I got what I was expecting was when they showed the results of her biting, you know, the bloody pelvic areas and the penis lying on the ground. Haha, it sounds gross, and it is, but it's funny too.The acting was almost good, but just not quite. I understand that the main girl won a prestigious award for her performance, but I'm not sure if I agree with that. In some scenes I can understand why she would deserve it, but in others, no way. It seems like bad direction for every actor to almost be good in their parts but not completely. I dunno, it didn't help the film. Somehow, despite not having good actors, there was pretty good character development. I could predict what characters were going to do and I could understand why they were doing it without needing any explanation. The story was simple. No complex changes, no surprises. It's very easy to follow.They used a nice camera and had some nice shots, but it wasn't enough to save the film. Ultimately, it was a huge disappointment. It could have been a lot better than it was.I could watch it again if I had no other option, but I really doubt I will feel the need or want to do so. I'm definitely not going to buy it.",Teeth
87,koen_smit,"Clever, well acted, tragic, surreal and funny – one of those movies I think everyone should have seen.",8,13 September 2014,"This is not your average horror movie. If it is a horror-movie at all. That is probably not the category where this movie belongs. Surreal tragi-comedy? Maybe.Vagina Dentata is Latin for a vagina with teeth. Mythologically used to describe the fear for castration as such vaginas are non-existing. Except in this movie where it freaks the owner, who is the main character, completely out when she discovers it the hard way. But after getting over the first shock, she decides to put the lower teeth to 'good' use.The premises of this movie could have easily been 'raped' into a bad B-horror movie but the creators decided to tell a dramatic coming-of-age story that at times is hilarious but never loses the severity of it. They found a great balance between the drama and comedy, and they keep you wondering where this is going. The story flows organic into the next scene and never feels weird or fabricated. It's never boring. Uncomfortable, yes, but that's because I'm a man and I obviously am scared of castration. So that could be the only reason this is classified as a horror movie. The style is quite sober, and they use repetitive scenes (like when she enters her house) to accompany her transition. They repeat that scene throughout the movie several times and the original action/walk is the same, but the emotions are totally different. Every time hat announces the next face of the story and it's clever writing.The leading actress, Jess Weixler, is a rare gem in the likes of Drew Barrymore, Kate Winslet and Uma Thurman. She doesn't need any lines to show us exactly what she thinks and feels. She grabs the story of this virtuous girl with both hands and leads us into her transition completely. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her. It's a great movie. Clever, well acted, tragic, surreal and funny – one of those movies I think everyone should have seen.",Teeth
88,luke-346,A good idea... that lacks bite!,6,15 June 2008,"Castration in cinema is a rarity and normally not a topic that draws audiences, but Director Mitchell Lichstenstein's Teeth is very different to the previous genre offerings that have tackled castration as both an anxiety and fear. The film begins with two step siblings playing ""you show me yours I'll show you mine"" in a paddling pool, only for Brad (John Hensley) to mysteriously sever his finger. The truth of the matter is Dawn (Jess Weixler) has a mutated condition, referred to in mythology as Vagina Dentata, thus explaining Brad's bleeding finger. The film immediately cuts to twelve years later and Dawn is now the prominent figure of a chastity group, thus conveniently explaining why she would still be unaware of her condition.As the film progresses Dawn becomes curious of her body and is forced to confront her mutation during a rape. She inadvertently castrates her attacker and upon realising what she has done is equally as horrified. The man, bleeding profusely, flees the scene leaving her distraught. The scene, and several of the ones to come, are horrific and if watching with others you will notice that the males in the audience will be the ones wincing and cross-legged. Teeth is a film that reverses the predisposed stereotype of a female victim meeting her doom via the means of a phallic shaped object, usually a knife. Penetration, it seems, is a favoured form of execution in many horror films but here it is dismemberment by the means of castration. Having said this, it should be noted that Dawn is not a character that revels in her ""ability"" she is horrified upon learning her condition and seeks to discover more. She doesn't wield her power, and neither is she bent on revenge  unlike the films Carrie, I Spit on Your Grave or Baise Moi. In Teeth is a female character that has yet to determine what's best for her, only the final reels of her dealing with her step brother hints at what she has become or what she will be become - it could also be alluding to a sequel. Teeth struggles to establish itself, yes we know it's a horror, but it feels more tender and heartfelt than perhaps it should. Audiences are likely to feel compassion for Dawn and empathise with her condition, more than perhaps the makers were intending. In doing so the film amounts to tender portrayal of young girls' journey in dealing with sexual awareness.Ultimately Teeth approaches male castration in probably the most primitive of fashions. It retells the perpetuated myth of the fear of the unknown to men, the vagina, and the mysteries that can lurk in its depths. It is a myth that has been told and re-told for generations and through civilisations, examples of it can be found in Greek mythology and artifacts that date back thousands of years. Feminists believe that its very existence is verification for an innate fear of women. For many psychoanalysts male castration anxiety is a favoured topic of exploration and investigation, some even cite it as being at the very foundations of all horror. Because the film tackles such a subject, and in this manner, it has raised some eyebrows as some critics believe the film to be derogative of men. This is due to it depicting them either craving sex, being violent, weak or as focal points of humiliation. Admittedly there are no strong male characters in this film, but give me a pen and paper and I'll a write a very long list of all the films in which there are no strong female characters, most of which will be horrors. The fact that the male is the victim in Teeth merely facilitates its story, it being about a toothed vagina.Many of the film-making aspects of the film are, if anything, competent. Directorially though, the film is enjoyable. The camera doesn't shy away from the severed members as they fall to floor and nor does it restrain from showing the blood. One scene that illustrates this and through doing so sticks in my mind is the young man that, after being castrated during sex, ejaculates blood from his messy stump. Any mediocre horror will have a scene that plays on in the audiences mind after the end credits and for Teeth, it is that one.Despite the fact I welcome Teeth to a genre littered with misogynistic films and weak female characters, I can't help but feel that it could have been better. For me Teeth fails living up to the promise of its premise, it is not the intelligent horror that some may have hoped for as it neglects to investigate or explore the myths. Instead it opts for a modern rendition tainted with teenage angst. Overall the film meanders along at slow pace, at 90 minutes in the length the first castration occurs almost 40mins in, and there are only 3 in total. I like the fact that the film is reactionary to the recent spate of torture porn films, but it is not as shocking and for some probably not as scary. Dawn is an interesting character and the manner in which her journey of discovery is told is also interesting, but that's it. Teeth is just a fun horror not to be taken too seriously, which is a shame because in doing so (pardon the pun) it lacks any real bite.",Teeth
89,smccar77,A fun yet clumsy commentary on women's sexuality,4,31 January 2011,"""Teeth"" is a mixed genre film that tells a comedic/horrific coming of age story about a woman who has teeth in her vagina. The goal of this film appears to be the creation of a strong heroine within a unique and taboo setting. While the film aspires to be a trenchant and one of a kind experience, it plays as an inchoate musing on feminism and female sexuality. Several assumptions contained in the film do not support the overall themes; rather these assumptions function to remove credibility and to demonstrate a spurious understanding of Feminist thought.The first assumption that the film makes regards the protagonist. She is a conservative Christian, late high school student with teeth in her vagina. The film centers around her burgeoning sexuality and the ways sex can be understood. Throughout the first quarter of the film, she appears to have practically no understanding of her unique genitals or female genitalia in general. This assumption is difficult to countenance in modern life. One would think that menstrual cycles, standard health examinations, and biology classes would render ignorance of vaginal teeth an impossibility. On the other hand, should suspension of disbelief allow for such a scenario, the female lead becomes aloof and possibly stupid.The second assumption required for the story is that men as a whole are morally bankrupt and driven by sex. The use of hyperbole to draw attention to an issue is a tried and true device. However, complete vilification of men has waning social weight and borders on being cliché. By employing a tired exaggeration, the film actually weakens any meaningful insight it may have on the issues of feminism and female sexuality. In essence, by relying on gross generalizations, one necessarily limits how much attention can be spent on elucidating subtle and nuanced details of the situation.The final assumption concerns the protagonist's reinterpretation of sex. By the closing of the film, the woman has realized that sex and the possibility of sex can be used as a social tool or weapon. She clearly demonstrates this new found knowledge by seducing and goring her step-brother. Within the immediate context of the film, this scene plays as an execution of justice and revenge. Yet, the implications of a woman realizing that she can use sex and her body as a weapon are much darker and frankly upsetting. Claiming that reinterpreting sex as a weapon is positive leads to the protagonist becoming a monster and not a liberated woman. More precisely, the woman's new perspective turns her into a capricious sex vigilante justified in her pursuits only because of a previous gross assumption that all men are amoral sex addicts.While the above review of themes is scathing, the film does have positive features. The production values, editing, sound, and acting are all well done and professional. The script and several scenes are quite clever, garnering some chuckles and gasps. The quality of the overall production is what leads to a four star review. What detracts from this film is a reliance on a gimmick and very little to no thought on that gimmick's implications to characters and feminist thought.On a completely personal note, I will not be recommending this film to friends. However, I do plan on mentioning it for its off beat subject matter and irresponsible use of philosophical material.",Teeth

92,Katy_Scary,I Haven't Even Jerked Off Since Easter!!!,10,13 July 2016,"This is the funniest sh*t I've seen in a while. It starts off as some kooky Brady Bunch type of neighborhood with a blended family and within 2 minutes of the movie someones finger is pricked, drawing blood, by a vagina with teeth. The gynecologist was like ""...Relax, Just breath, breath thru the pain"" and then SNAP!, her vagina bit off 4 of the perverts fingers. When her step brother's pit bull (Mother) chewed up his penis I died. This will definitely be a cult classic. I wonder if someone somewhere in this weird world has a vagina with teeth or a penis with snake venom. The ending was weird. Did she bite the old mans penis off? Did she ever find a cure? So many questions. I think there are 2 morals of the story. 1. No Means No and 2. Don't be a Dick or it will be bitten off with a Vagina. Oh and make sure you read the discussion threads on this movie. It's some of the funniest commentary on IMDb.",Teeth
93,MrsOrange,Teeth Has Bite!,9,7 November 2019,Whoa! I was sold on the premise alone but was not expecting this to be so funny. My girl Jess Wexler delivers a great lead performance and the effects are excellent! I wish the director made more movies like this. It's really one of a kind!!,Teeth
94,DJMo,Check your man bits after watching this film,7,22 December 2008,"Gentlemen, check your man bits after watching this film! No, it's not about the African disappearing penis myth. It's about vagina dentata. Basically, it makes 'The Crying Game' seem not so bad. All I ask is that you do not see this as a date movie. Jess Weixler is terrific as Dawn, as she suffers horny creeps one after another in this campy, misandrist thriller-comedy. John Hensley is uber-creepy as Brad, Dawn's brother. You will either love this or hate yourself for watching it, but if you are a fan of bizarre horror or cult movies (i.e. Re-Animator, Sweet Movie, Tetsuo), you will probably find something to like here. You've been forewarned.",Teeth
95,b1lskirnir,Disappointing even for low expectations,2,22 January 2008,"The general formula for getting a new movie recognized in America nowadays tends to be by means of a clever gimmick or craft in advertising and hype (Cloverfield, The 300, etc.). Teeth is an interesting addition to this formula, as it is a B-horror movie that is generally marketed to an indie comedy audience. Iif you're interested in seeing it it's almost guaranteed you know what it's about before walking into the theater. Unfortunately for Teeth, it manages to give you just that and absolutely nothing else for 90 minutes, and I mean that in the worst possible way:The movie is about a teenage girl who discovers teeth in her vagina.That's it. You can basically write the rest of the story yourself.Yep, there's pretty much nothing else to the movie beyond that. The film milks its premise of the audience knowing what's going to come for nearly 45 minutes before anything involving the plot actually happens. By the time she discovers her problem, half of the movie is gone and any opportunity for interesting character development, sexual commentary, dramatic tension, or remote intelligence is thrown out the window.Teeth milks as many plot devices for cheap comedic payoff as possible as well: the young, innocent Christian girl who takes a vow of chastity, the boyfriend who wants her to break that vow, the difficulties between being either a prude or a slut in high school... without ruining whatever story there actually remains to ruin. There's a subplot involving her negligent and completely cookie-cutter character of a brother being a jerk to her parents as well, but it fails to develop that at all for the sake of throwing in more jokes about biting and vaginas than Mr. Freeze has jokes about ice in Batman & Robin.By the time her character is thrown any interesting development and drama in the way of this bizarre plot, it's already turned into a generic rape/revenge B-movie and the credits have come up the screen. I've heard some women say they felt ""liberated"" by this movie and to those women I would advise them to seek therapy as soon as possible. To say that is no better than saying as a sexually frustrated male I felt ""liberated"" watching pornography, which of course cannot be said due to political correctness.It could've been an interesting study of womanhood, of growing up, of men's sexual fears and the relationship between loving someone and having sex with them... but it's not. It's a sleazy, stupid exploitation flick that doesn't spare any opportunity to show its violent acts in gory detail. It also proves, sadly, that indie movies suffer from the same marketing gimmicks and worn-out clichés as mainstream movies. If you want something better but along similar thematic lines, I would recommend Hard Candy, Lady Vengeance, and of course the classic Virgin Spring. But please, avoid this at all costs unless you just enjoy dumb, sick thrills.",Teeth
96,Crackhouse2,How come teeth is pants?,2,5 May 2008,"Firstly, the opening scene where the two kids are in a paddling pool and the little boy cuts his finger, you had no idea that the little girls privates had anything to do with it. Then some years later the plot slowly moves towards the fact that evolution has made her this way as some form of natural defence from predators. Needless to say, after some irrelevant mind numbing minutes of soft plot about chastity and purity....oh and don't forget the mild explanation using the rattle snake as a model in evolution...then something happens. Her goody goody two shoes, chaste love interest turns nasty and tries to have his way with her in a cave. Needless to say, it's not her Colgate smile that fends him off, it's the other set that lop off his little fella, with a graphic depiction of it as well. Anyways, i'm a fan of the genre and i like nothing more than a slowly building plot which gives you chance to connect with the characters, but i didn't care less about anyone in this film, quite the opposite and the plot itself was a bit too farcical anyways, interesting idea, evolution develops carnivorous vulva, but on the whole the plot and characters were delivered in such a way that i couldn't give a rats... anyways, i don't recommend it and on your head be it if you watch it. I only gave it 2 stars because there must be something out there worse than this, but having just wasted X amount of minutes i'm a touch disgruntled as i can't ever get them back.",Teeth
97,bryanross1985,"Teeth: so many promises, so few kept.",4,6 November 2008,"OK, Teeth is about as subtle as a kick in the teeth but it is actually quite a funny movie.The advertisements for this movie promised that it would be the definitive horror film of the 00's as The Exorcist was for the 70's , The Shining for the 80's and The Blair Witch Project was for the 90's (I personally think that Scream deserved this more than the BWP). I looked forward to this film and rushed to the cinema to see it.Whilst I was not completely disappointed with the film, I do feel that it lacked the horror that it promised in the trailers. The premise was disturbing as was the first 5 minutes, but after that it was like a cross between an after-school special (the whole purity thing), the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (in that you don't actually see that much blood or gore) and American Pie (what you did see was laugh out loud funny).This is a good Friday night film to watch with your friends but in terms of lasting value, this will go out of date quicker than day-old doughnuts.",Teeth

The acting was dismal, I felt like I was watching a movie. What I mean when I say that is that NOTHING was convincing. Almost zero of the characters seemed like people that might actually exist. This film tries to achieve ""comedy/horror"" status, and fails miserably. None of it was unsettling or disturbing, and this movie was about as funny as watching a baby get punted off a cliff. The jokes were weighed down by the terrible acting.....hell, the jokes wouldn't have been funny WITH good acting. I don't even know what else to say...I have an easier time writing reviews for good movies....I'm too bored with this movie to pick apart what else make it so bad. I should probably have given it a 1/10 instead of the deserving 3/10, just to balance out all these nut-job ratings.

Dawn looks embarrassed to be acting in it. The scene with her gynaecologist was the only highlight of the film and even that was because I was laughing as the acting was so bad.Seriously, this is a stupid, pointless and badly acted film that lowers the standards for shock horror flicks to a new depth.

It starts out really slow paced, story/drama about a girl who meets a boy, and has a crazy brother and the mother is sick. Well until now you have nothing special. You get stuck in this part of the story for almost 30 minutes, and then when you think things will start to pick up everything changes from a drama to a really bad comedy/horror movie. They had a nice premise but the plot goes nowhere, and the acting is so bad that I almost ripped my hair out. Jess Weixler is bad, and Hale Appleman is even worse. In the first scene that they meet/talk, it was the worse piece of acting/direct that I have ever seen. And for the rest of the movie Hale only has one expression on his face, at least Jess has two different expressions.

103,CliffFraser,A Gentle and Sensitive Movie,8,5 January 2009,"I found this to be a gentle and sensitive movie. True it did tend to cast all males as being potential rapists and it was a little far-fetched suggesting that there are 16 year old virgins in the USA, but apart from those two errors the director did a magnificent job bringing an ancient myth up-to-date. As for it being labeled a horror movie, well if you are like any of the male characters in the movie then I guess it might be. Anyone who was disappointed with this movie should watch it again free of the pre-conceptions they had first time round. This time appreciate the directors groundwork and the way that every element of the movie has a beginning, a meaning and a conclusion. Even the ending puts most of 2008's movie offerings to shame. It even begs a Teeth 2 with a less than innocent ex-virgin dealing with guys who don't know how to keep their secret, secret.

It's a nice little gem of a movie.This film breathes some fresh air into the common horror-comedy-teen drama genre by ironically taking the male predators in this movie and making them victims of an innocent girl with a rare mutation. If guys are only thinking with their crotches at that age, then they sure get what they deserve in this film.Disguised as a simple, well-executed horror-comedy, ""Teeth"" is laced with subtext criticizing American puritanism: Biology textbooks are defiled by the board of education, leaving our heroine clueless about her body; Abstinence movements turn out to be mere gatherings of sanctimonious hormone-overwhelmed teens.So under the fun scenes you probably imagine from the plot, you've got a nice little message too.",Teeth

Gobble!,2,6 July 2008,"The premise for this movie - that a virgin discovers that she has teeth (that bite hard) in her vagina - is more terrible than the movie itself; unless, that is, you consider the acting, shot choices and dialogue. It aspires to somewhere between camp and Lovecraft and falls short on both counts, being neither a tale of horror, nor something that will delight generations to come. It falls by the wayside, a burnt out shell of a novel and disturbing idea.It has it's moments; but they are occluded by the very visceral nature of the subject matter and then obscured by the low grade acting and camera work. It just doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. Which is too bad, since it is such a novel idea.It has left me stunned. That's about all I can say in its favor. I give it a thumbs down.

The climax is somewhat unusual as well when seen against the rest of the film.But the disappointment is that the film is not gripping. I saw the trailer and was thrilled to see how the director has dealt with the subject. I honestly believe that a far better film is possible on the same concept, perhaps on the same story. Many scenes were not needed and the ones that were essential were pointlessly stretched. The creation of suspense was too long without anything thrilling happening and when it does happen its not at all brilliant. The film could have been a short 30 minutes film. Then it would have been a marvel of a creation. But the director just stretched a small story far too long.The lead actress has not acted so well in the first half, but she was good in the second half. Nice performance by her overall. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning.I am personally interested in myths and mythologies. Perhaps thats why I liked the film. I would love to see a film on the same concept and same story. If you are interested in a broad variety of cinema then you may like the film. But if you are in for a fabulous sexual thriller I am sure you would be disappointed.A 6/10 wouldn't hurt... would it?",Teeth

You just thinking at the end of the movie how desperate the producer must have been or how high he was when he decided to write this kind of crap.

If this film was about a guy with a dagger dick who went around ripping vagina's my reaction would be the same. It is horrible to think that someone would be sick enough to make a movie about some girl going around and castrating men. Very sickening thought. Hollywood is definitely out of ideas. Why am I not surprised? Oh right; they've been out of ideas for a long time!It is also very sexist as well. They make out all the males; except for Dawn's father, to be either a rapist or sex offender of some kind.Let me also point out that I was really hoping that Dawn would get owned in the end.

However, about 30 minutes in, I realized this movie was going no where and fast. There isn't a single character that I liked. My main problem is that every male character is portrayed as a selfish, chauvinistic rapist. To keep it simple and sweet, I guess I was just expecting a lot more ""biting"" incidents and character development. Oh well.On a side not, I watched this movie the same night I watched ""Cannibal: the Musical"" and ""Battle Royale."" I liked both of those movies much better.

111,refined_cujo-1,Oh my God,10,23 June 2007,"I just saw this at the Sydney Film Festival. It was a packed cinema. We all were screaming and laughing- explosivley. And now that I'm home, I'm kind of in shock and have a sick little knot in my stomach.Firstly, the premise is interesting- SPOILER MAYBE- i say maybe because it is actually a real hoot if you go into this movie not knowing anything about it...A Girl and her special vagina...END SPOILERBut its really the execution that pulls it off. Although it is hilariously funny, the filmmakers have played it straight and real. I've read somewhere on here that the cinematography and direction was horrible and this is totally NOT TRUE- they were grade A. I was actually impressed. You could see the budget- yeah, it was modest, but i really thought they classed it up. All of the performances are great, the effects grizzly, but not overtly exploitive- that said, the flashes of violence are of high impact. Someone on the boards compared it to I Spit on your Grave, which it does have some similarities too, but only obvious ones (trust me when you see it you will know), but it really is a different cake altogether. This film is more akin to Lucky Mckee's May- which also had the strong humour . So what is this film exactly? Horror? Comedy? Drama? Satire? Well it is all of these. But although it is funny and at times very moving and the entire time the satyric jabs run hard and fast- it is in the end a horror movie, proud and true. Reminiscent more than anything, of Cronenbergs early stuff (Rabid especially). If your a man you may find the impact harder, if your a woman- well I don't know. The girls I saw it with all loved it, but all for different reasons. Its really well put together, all the elements are there and working. This and Inland Empire were my favourites from the festival. Both left me feeling troubled and unable to sleep.Some may think the movie is mean spirited, but it's not- there is a strong sensitive empathy with the prime family unit- this movie just has (pardon the pun- its worth it) BITE. See it:Warning, the following statement contains unverified judgements: if your a straight man, you will scream, if your a woman you will either go with it, perhaps even judging yourself for it later and as for the gay guys in the audience; well here's another reason to steer clear of vaginas.",Teeth

We will be seeming more good things coming from this guy.Really disappointed by Josh Pais. He phoned in his portrayal as the doctor. He misread the need for overacting and stood out as being somehow out of sync with the rest of the cast.I can't believe this movie sold for $2.5M I'm quite sure that the people buying didn't watch it or didn't car because they could make some money just on the topic.It generated a lot of buzz just because the topic makes you curious to see it, but you will be disappointed when you do actually go and see it.",Teeth
113,giopotes,A horror film that can cut right through you!,9,3 April 2010,"Who says vagina dentata isn't an interesting subject?Teeth is a horror comedy about the myth of vaginal ""teeth"". Theatrical trailers said that it made men squeal - a similar way Fatal Attraction 20 years ago was received. It's great to see a horror movie this brilliant at the same time funny and gross.Three penises and four fingers were cut in the story but it was clear in the film that no man was harmed in the making of the movie. I like Teeth not because of those cutting-edge (hahaha) scenes but because it's a movie that made men check out their wives, mistresses and girlfriends and see if they have teeth in their vaginas. It's good to see an original intelligent horror movie made at the time where stupid remakes and gornography destroy the entire horror genre.I like the horrifyingly funny script (Tobey's sexually frustrated declaration ""I HAVEN'T EVEN JERKED OFF SINCE EASTER!"" was a real teenage example of reasons to have sex) and the simple but unique direction by Lichtenstein. Teeth isn't as serious as the screamer Fatal Attraction but it does manage to scare men... leave them jerking off rather than having sex.

I do like the creativity...I say that a lot, but at least they wanted to try something different. Of course, the idea of a young girl with teeth in her...womanly area...isn't a story meant for an Oscar or anything like that, it was still an attempt at something different for viewers. I appreciate what they were all trying to do, but if they had more effort and more commitment to the story, it would have turned it a whole lot better.

115,sonicred007,Cracking Horror Debut,7,19 September 2010,"Teeth is remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, it throws a big custard pie at religion. Secondly, it throws another big custard pie in the face of US high school clichés. Much of this horror plays out like a classic US indie flick - all angst and understated lighting. The lead character has taken a pledge to remain chaste until marriage and adheres strictly to this code. Goaded by the others who think her prudish and worshipped by other religious zealots she is quickly established as a hero and anti-hero to different clans. Confused by her own sexual awakenings she discovers via being raped that she has something else in her vagina when the boy who is attacking her recoils in terror minus his penis. And so the film goes: sometimes for laughs and sometimes for terror. The doctor who examines her is particularly despicable and deserves to lose fingers. The ending is where it's at - alone in a car with a toothless old redneck who helped her escape. Only like all the other boys he just wants her sex. Now she knows what to do; there's nothing to fear anymore .... certainly with her vaginal dentures she is the one to be feared in a sexual attack. Only in her case it'd be a perverse sense of self-defence.",Teeth

I expected to see a introspective movie about the Dawn struggling, as she can't have the true intimacy with someone she loves. As i kept on watching , i found that the movie is not what i expected, but still it's a nice black humor.This black humor film is not bad entirely, still compelling to see what Dawn is going to do and guess when she's gonna cut another penis.Particularly, it was very hilarious to see Ryan got his penis cut down by Dawn because he stupidly revealed that the love was actually a bet. This scene pleases the girls who may have been deceived by some bad guys, well, as a guy, i found this scene quite interesting too. But this scene can be made better if the surgery part was not shown in between the scene at Ryan's room, i haven't thought that Ryan will be castrated, but the inserted surgery scene just ruined it.There are some problems, or might be some unanswered questions left for the sequel. Dawn killed Toby, left her ""teeth"" on his wound, also she cut the finger of the doctor, and no doubt she'll castrate the old man in the end as well, she left too many traces to the police, will she be able to escape from the police? or turn her self in?

119,elaine-105,"If you thought vagina dentata was a myth, you've clearly never been to the American Bible belt",8,12 September 2007,"High school sweetheart Dawn (Jess Weixler) doesn't know what female genitalia are supposed to look like. The diagram in her sex ed text book has been covered over with a great big sticker. And, because she's a devoted member of a 'true love waits' abstinence programme, she's never had the chance to put her rose-tinted wedding day sexual fantasies into action.But when fellow 'promise' member Tobey (Hale Appleman) pushes his luck too far, he finds out he's bitten off rather more than he can chew  or rather, Dawn has. A sleazy gynaecologist (Josh Pais) finds himself in a similar painful position when he gets a little over enthusiastic in his examinations, and as for the loser who sleeps with her to settle a bet, and her foul-mouthed, pot-smoking, misogynistic stepbrother (played, somewhat ironically, by Nip/Tuck's John Hensley) ouch! Yup, Teeth, like The Lost Boys or Fright Night, is a horror/comedy with bite  although the teeth in question are not in the mouth. Yes, ho ho, it's all very funny, we get to see lots of hilarious chewed off willies and spouting stumps. But Teeth also has a more serious agenda  not least in its implication that Dawn's mutation may have something to do with the enormous factory chimneys belching foul smoke into the air behind her house, or its satirical poke at born again American puritanism.But mainly, like American Werewolf in London, Teen Wolf and their aforementioned 1980s vampire chums, Teeth is about growing up. It's about the unexpected, embarrassing things that start to happen to the body, over which it appears one has no control; and it's about sex, and how actually, when you're a teenager, sex can be really quite scary.While 1980s horror comedy tended to focus around young men, as their freaky new urges put them at the mercy of predatory females like Grace Jones's marvellous Katrina in Vamp, Teeth is set squarely in the girly camp. But whereas your traditional horror heroine, from Halloween's Laurie onwards, draws strength from not having sex, Dawn discovers that sex can be a weapon.Clips from old horror films featuring giant black widow spiders and a serpent-haired Medusa serve both to emphasise Dawn's links to ancient, powerful, mythic figures, and to sink Teeth firmly into the tradition of the B-movie, which has always served as a warped reflection of current social fears, from invading Ruskie aliens to demon kids. And in an age where women are increasingly portrayed in the media as pliable and plastic, desperate and disposable, where rape convictions sit at around three per cent and drinking 'til you throw up is regarded as empowering, it's refreshing and exciting to see Dawn's transition from helpless victim to archetypal femme fatale. Isn't it time we women all started celebrating what God's given us, instead of trying to starve our bodies into submission, or sculpt them under the knife? In effect, isn't it time we started biting back? But if you're worried that this post-feminist dissection makes the film sound rather dull, remember, you do get to see a dog swallow half a penis, and spit out the Prince Albert afterwards. Was that a spoiler? Well, it certainly was for the dog...",Teeth

121,jpjmoffett,Vagina-dentata retelling as a black comedy,4,9 July 2013,"The Good: Cinematography and production value were immediately noticeable for their quality. The computer animation during the opening credits were interesting and relevant, which is refreshing; I detest seeing credits at the beginning of a film but this sort of thing makes it a tad more bearable.Acting performances and characters were believable and enjoyable. Jess Weixler and John Hensley were especially noticeable for the honesty and sincerity they brought to their respective roles of Dawn and Brad. Hale Appleman did an excellent job with the few minutes of screen time he was given as Tobey by creating an emotional and interesting character that could have otherwise simply faded into the overall yawn of the film. These three actors did a tremendous job with what they had to work with and certainly saved the movie for this reviewer.The soundtrack was mediocre though fitting in that it didn't particularly add to the film but didn't detract from it either. The song choices of Dawn's parents added some humor.The campyness was masterfully done, being maintained just below the point where it is almost annoying, leaving the viewer with a sense of pity for the lead characters as opposed to simply finding them annoying. The character of the asshole brother Brad made for a nice opposable force that made them film more lively.The masturbation/wedding night fantasy scene was very well done in terms of film-making finesse and was indicative of the high quality camera and lighting work to be found throughout.The Bad: The pacing of the story lingered for too long at times on non-plot-driving items. The Nuclear-Reactors-Looming-on-the-Horizon bit was overplayed and eventually distracting; some subtlety would have made it a more intense detail, but it's a comedy, so why not I guess. Speaking of comedy, there seemed to be a surprising lack of it. Unless you find boring funny. In all fairness, the gynecology scene did bring an audible laugh. The only audible laugh.The Ugly: the editing in Teeth was professional by any account, but as mentioned before the scenes had a tendency to begin and/or end without the fat being trimmed which gave the film an overall lethargic feel. Since the movie has a run time of 88 minutes, it might be assumed that this was done to pad the length a little. It definitely would have made a superior short film, but as a feature length, it leaves a great deal to be desired - like the entire Hero's Journey concept.In terms of genre, Teeth seems to be unaware of it's target, falling instead into some vague netherworld between drama, horror, and black comedy without ever actually committing to any of them. Because of this, the film ends up feeling like a two hour shrug.Old School: Almost no gore and very little excitement. If you're not drinking, you'll most likely be bored.New Blood: Younger audiences will be put off by how slow this movie feels. Still, the extremism of the Christian chastity theme will probably get some laughs. If you're under the legal drinking age you'll most likely be bored.To See or Not to See? Rent, buy, pirate or con? Don't waste the hard-drive space for sure, and unless you can check it out for free at your local library I would not advise renting it. If you really feel like you have to see this film then con your roommate into renting it. Afterwards, you can blame the choice of getting it on someone who isn't there to defend themselves.

Teeth had the potential to be a very scary and funny movie. But the jokes are not so funny as the creators thought they were. At the beginning i cared about Dawn, she was a very beautiful smart high school girl. She was like Carrie, and at the end she does things that are stupid or very sick. I think that this movies main problem is the script, and sometimes the acting is bad. And the horror it promises in the trailer, it never is delivered. This movie always makes you say: ""Wouldn't it be great if they'd do that."" or "" Why is she doing that, doesn't she fear the consequences. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a good movie.

I don't know, because it fails on both levels. First, let's get one thing out of the way; you know this movie is about a girl with teeth in her hoohah, but you're never going to see it. That part is never shown, it's left to the imagination. We assume it's a mutation caused by the nuclear plant in the distance (which has the biggest cooling towers ever created on Earth.) So is there horror here? Not really, because you know what's coming about 10 minutes ahead of time, and it's not scary. Just gross, with members being dismembered. And it seems as though having your member removed has widely different effects on people. It will kill some guys, while some shriek in pain, and some just have a dumbfounded sort of look on their faces. So it's not scary. Is it funny? No, not at all, because it's so predictable, and the characters are 2D at best. The lead goes from chaste abstinence girl to skank in 2 days, with no real moral dilemma. It just didn't seem thought out very well past ""let's have a girl with teeth in her hoohah, and she'll chop off some man junk"". I mean, there's a scene where she peels a censor sticker covering female genitalia in a textbook to see what normal people look like, then goes online to search for something. Really? You couldn't have used the internet to look at the 8 bazillion pages with female genitalia? It was an interesting idea that falls flat.",Teeth

While the synopsis gives most of the story away, the acting and tones throughout the movie make it a worthwhile watch. The first third of the movie sets the stage for character development, which ends up dictating the tone for the movie throughout. Characters were well developed, but not overdeveloped, giving the audience just enough, and letting the story unfold as the movie progressed. The second third of the movie satisfies the gore enthusiasts with wild effects and ""prosthetics"" if you will. Easily one of the more disturbing things in recent horror movie history. The final third allows the characters to finally finish their development and come full circle, completing the story and ends in an empowering finale where you might just find yourself rooting for the next victim to fall prey to his biggest fear.",Teeth

This film is pure comedy with a bit of gore and nudity in it. Although i thought that it was a bit of a disappointment, i liked the stupidness of the whole thing. The acting was a bit robotic (i think that it was supposed to be like this though...) and the characters, for example Ryan, had a dumb, naive, yet evil personality and look to him.

The lead up is sloppy and the film holds no suspense. The only entertaining factor in the film is when the main character goes to the doctor's office; but I won't ruin the hilarious scene for those who have not seen the film but wish to.

If this hadn't been a B-movie, perhaps the additional funding could've given the themes a strong foundation to make a real cultural impact, but unfortunately a movie about a woman taking control of her sexuality and gaining confidence in it will more than likely remain a cult classic without any real cultural impact, regardless of its obvious potential importance.

In the process of getting my answer I was treated to a refreshingly unflinching examination of teen mores, unrequited love, revenge, and feminism all wrapped up in a coming of age story brilliantly headed by Jess Weixler.John Hensley is equally absurd and on-target in the role of her troubled brother Brad and the disturbingly believable cast of characters takes the viewer from one unexpected place to the other while always ringing true.Underneath its veneer of teen/horror camp, 'Teeth' is intelligently accessorized with the kind of ticking subtext that pumps the narrative through with humor, spunk, and heart.

This movie is just Feminist Garbage. A lot like Hard Candy, both movies making men look evil and both ended up making (sane and human) viewers feel bad for the men and thinking the women were sick and twisted. Hard Candy some psychotic chick makes a guy jump off a roof and hang himself and in Teeth 3 guys lose their privates and a doctor looses 4 fingers. In the end I was left feeling like this girl, with teeth where they don't belong was not genetically superior, but really a mutant freak. I mean OK the first guy was actually doing something wrong, but the second guy? Oh I see, he didn't love her so he should just get castrated. And the last guy should die because of your mom dying. Way to put the blame onto other people.Luckily this movie is devoid of character development, a serious plot or anything that could stimulate girls to take this seriously. I mean really, after watching this what guy didn't feel sick to his stomach. Castration left and right and this chick who's supposed to be waiting until marriage for sex just instantly turns into the town bike. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't and if you have don't again. Waste of time and space in your head. Want to see an empowering chick movie? How about The Brave One? or Legally Blonde, all that chick stuff, girls. If you need gross depiction of senseless violence(and not even horror, so it's not fun) your life must really be bad.

Some parts *are* graphic, mind you. However, it is tasteful and horrific at the same time in a way that was brilliantly executed. Jess Weixler is an amazingly talented actress who portrays Dawn in a perfectly believable way. Ashley springer is also a brilliant actor whose performance in this movie truly gave me chills.That being said, I really have no desire to watch this movie again. While watching it the first time, and not knowing what to expect, I was glued to the screen. However, I have no desire in any way to watch this movie again. A lot of it, I think, is that I know much of the fun of this movie will be lost if I watch it a second time. This is an effect a lot of horror movies have, and I understand that giving a horror film replay value is a very, very difficult thing to achieve. Sure, you can always show your friend s so they can enjoy it as well, but I doubt you will ever enjoy this movie even half as much as you did the first time.I must say that a lot of independent horror films can learn a lot from this film.

The story is rather unsettling and gruesome at some points but still somewhat original which makes this actually worth the 1,5 hours. As an indie movie you can rely on the story to be short and straight foreward without the big twists. But I don't mean that in a bad way. It's a nice movie for an lazy weekday evening. Just don't expect too much of this one because it's good in it's own subtle way.Despite the underlying overly feminist view-points, aggression towards the male sex and abstinence-themed atmosphere, it can be quite interesting even for a guy (like me) to watch with its blend of sinister, awkward and selfish characters. Even though all the men in the movie eventually turn out as antagonists it's still makes a guy cheer for the motley heroine.Overall a quite good movie but not one suited for anyone who wants a fairytale or a heartwarming story.

However, in an unbelievable case of lying to themselves, they decide that going swimming in a cave is a great thing to do, without any problems. After some more UST, Dawn and Tobey end up in the cave, and get hot and heavy. Dawn, remembering her vows of purity (and most likely that bitten finger), tries to put the kibosh on premarital shenanigans. Tobey disagrees and proceeds to rape her. CRUNCH. She bites off his penis, and runs away as he is left bleeding in the pond.After doing some Internet research, Dawn goes to the gynecologist for the first time to see what's up. In a scene right out of my worst medical nightmares, the doctor (Josh Pais) pretends to conduct a pelvic exam, but it's really a Molesting Exam. I'm not even sure I'm allowed to name the act he performed on her on this website, because Oh My God. After what seems like forever on screen, Dawn freaks out and bites off his fingers. Thank you, Dawn. She runs out of the office while the doctor clutches his hand and screams ""vagina dentata!"" over and over. (How he knew what to call it baffles me. He should have been screaming ""my hand!"" because I'm sure he should be more concerned with that.) After this, Dawn finds out that Tobey is dead. Also, her mother -- who is sick -- collapses and calls for help as Douchebag Stepbrother Brad (John Hensley) bangs his girlfriend. The girlfriend at least wanted to see what was wrong -- but she wasn't really in a position to do anything about it. Meanwhile, a thoroughly traumatized Dawn goes to this boy Ryan's house to figure out her life. Ryan (Ashley Springer) slips her some drugs and helps her relax and sleep. Feeling better, Dawn agrees to some consensual sex and Ryan is able to stay intact. The next morning, Dawn agrees to some more nookie, but finds out that Ryan made a bet with his friends that he could sleep with Dawn. CRUNCH. Luckily, Ryan's mom was home, so at least someone heard his screams, unlike Poor Dead Rapist Tobey.Meanwhile, Dawn's mother dies, her stepbrother gets douchier (setting his dog on his own father!) and Dawn finds out from the girlfriend that Brad could have helped, but didn't. So, Dawn gets prettied up and goes to meet her stepbrother in his bedroom. Overcome with the thrill of incest (I know they're not related, but it's still incesty), Brad gets it on with Dawn, although he's starting to remember where he put that bitten finger. But, he remembers too late. CRUNCH. Bye Little Brad. I hope the dog didn't gag on it as she ate it up.Dawn runs away on her bike, but it breaks, so she hitchhikes. She ends up with a creepy old man who locks the doors and puts the moves on her. But now he isn't the hunter, she is.The interesting thing for me about this movie is how much like Unbreakable it was. What I liked about that movie is that you learn about the hero and the villain before they become such. We see their backstory before they are done becoming what they are and can be with them from the beginning. At the end of Teeth, I was left with a similar feeling, but I was unsure if she would end up as a hero or an anti-hero. (It would be hard for me to say she was a villain, because everyone she attacked deserved it. If we can't condemn Batman for vigilante justice, we can't condemn Dawn for biting off a molester's fingers.) The only attack that I wasn't too fond of was Ryan. Sure what he did was horrible. But, I'm not sure he deserved to get dismembered like that for being a jerk. The others were ghastly, but considering that in most horror movies kids get axe murdered all the time for smoking dope and making out, this was pretty tame. And these men had it coming. I suppose that was the other issue I had with the film: I know it was exaggerated for plot, but did every guy in this movie have to be a rapist, or a horrible human being? Couldn't there have been one guy that wasn't the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the world? I guess the stepfather was okay, but his role was so small that we never got to see much goodness. I'm not even asking for a good guy 00 just not for so much two-dimensionality.Despite my slight criticisms, I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and highly recommend it. If you're a fan of dark comedies, and particularly ones with original plots, this movie should not be missed.",Teeth
152,fenderbender-1,hybrid,7,12 February 2007,"When I read the caption to this movie I was not sure what to await; when I read first comments I was even more unsure. I got into the screening at the Berlin International Film Festival since a friend's friend was the cinematographer of this picture. I got to admit the movie starts a bit shaky in tone and setting, but does this always have to be such a bad thing ? Along the way it found it's own -admittedly- intriguing to mesmerizing hybrid of style between social satire, coming of age and teen splatter...yet avoiding the pitfalls that each of those genres might have had. It is a strange, maybe estranging experience to watch - but what do you expect from a such a topic of ancient horrific myth ? All in all an entertaining experience.Very good performances not only of John Hensley but also of Jess Weixler, especially as her character tends to grasp and discover her ""power"" later in the film. I would'nt want to say who was better...Also one or two just incredible, uhhh, funny scenes. Yes, it borders on the kind of humour you would expect from teen pie-comedies.

Once the gore is over it's pretty much a waste of time. The character spends too much time trying to understand her issue when its already obviously been made clear to the audience. I watched this movie knowing already what to expect and when those handful of scenes do happen you're left wanting more. I wish it would of been planned out properly and given a little more thought as too whom she chooses as her ""victims"". Their are a few selected scenes that could have been better. The one thing I did like about this movie was the gore; it's not that graphic but it's not a movie you'd watch with your ten year old.

While this movie is graphic, the conflicting tones of horror and comedy give it a playfulness and a freshness that any true movie-lover could appreciate. Now, its not by any means the best movie ever or the funniest or most horrific but it shines its light. The story and characters are all cheesy/campy but thats what gives this movie its charm. Its almost like whats going on is so absurd and awful and awkward you have no choice but to laugh! I don't recommend this film to the faint of heart but if you are in the mood for something new and will keep you talking for weeks, then I say this is the film for you.

First you have the parody of the self-righteous religious zealots who manipulate group/mob mentality to profess something that is inherently impossible - teenagers having sexual urges and not acting upon them. Secondly, the victimization of the main character is exaggerated for dramatic effect. Given the fact that many children and teenagers have been abused, the argument against this storyline as a plot point is moot at best. Finally, the concept of sexual mutilation is so taboo in western society that men become hysterical when it is presented to them in graphic terms. This film unnerves most anyone, especially those who fantasize in rape fantasies and male domination. Check your ego, and revisit it after viewing this excellent film.

This move was a spectacular mix of horror, comedy, and disturbing special effects which is a must see movie for all horror buffs.My favorite aspect of Sundance, apart from the Britney or Paris sightings (uhg!) are the independent horror movies. Every year I am pleased with the offerings  Blair Witch was entertaining (though over hyped by the time it was released); Wai Keung Lau's ""The Park,"" was a blast, Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"" was horror at its best, and now Lichtenstein's ""Teeth"" was a bloody trip, which, because the vast majority of theater owners are male, I am not sure will see the wide release it deserves.The movie involves a high school girl named Dawn, played convincingly by Jess Weixler. Dawn possesses the condition called Vagina dentata (see Wikipedia). The condition exacts sweet, painful justice on the abusive men she encounters. Through the use of tense music, convincing acting, and prosthetic special effects real enough to make all of the men in the audience groan, the result is a horror comedy of top-notch caliber.",Teeth
161,p-spedding-2,"Brilliant film, brilliantly acted by Jess Weixler",10,3 August 2007,"I saw this film at the Melbourne International Film Festival. It was packed and the atmosphere was fantastic. The crowd loved it; it is not hard to see why.The story is relatively simple (coming-of-age story), the film contains stock-characters (sick mother, bad-boy brother etc), and the cinematography and special effects are basic: which some people here have whined about. As it happens, none of this matters.Jess Weixler is outstanding as Dawn; brilliantly and believably portraying an ostracised adolescent driven by her fear of sex to champion purity pledging. Dawn's first sexual encounter goes horribly wrong, her ambivalent exploration turning, unexpectedly, to assault and dis-memberment (I do not need to explain Dawn's special powers). Weixler convincingly portrays an utterly traumatised Dawn who (quite reasonably and, therefore, quite unexpectedly in a 'horror' film) turns to the Internet and then a doctor for help. The doctor, alas, is unprofessional. The audience expect something to go awry and it does, spectacularly and unforgettably. This gynecologist will never play the piano again.At this point, Dawn turns to a minor male character, a would-be suitor who has been sympathetically portrayed. So, although the audience is expecting more blood, when things go well for Dawn, really well, the audience is delighted. Weixler radiates joy, relief and contentment. And this is where the film really hits its stride. In the remaining encounters, the entire story is told by the expression of Weixler's face. She is hurt, she retaliates, and then regrets her actions. She gets angry, plans, and then carries out, her revenge, and so on. She is perfect.For me, the two most memorable scenes are, first: the moment when Dawn first uses her teeth intentionally. She has gone from joyful, to hurt and confused, to angry and then vengeful in about thirty seconds. As soon as the audience sees the look of the steely resolution on her face they know, your ****** (i.e., in trouble); second, the moment when Dawn presents the evidence, as it were, to her victim, confirming the terrible truth of what has happened to him. Brilliant.",Teeth

Of course the same thing would work for men too, after all it's not only women who get raped. I'm sure rape would be a thing of the past if evolution went this way.As for the film itself, it was okay, nothing spectacular but worth a watch on telly when there's nothing else on. The story was a little slow but the scenes where the guys get 'it' bitten off are funny and do make you cringe a bit (even us girls). Why is it though that every guy she meets turns out to be a perv? The only decent man in it is the step-dad. It makes it look like 99% of the male population are dirty perverts which is unfair I think.

I don't mean so-bad-it's-good, I mean good.The key is that the movie is restrained. You get the shots that will make you cringe--the filmmakers don't skimp on the juicy stuff--but nothing outrageous. More importantly, 'Teeth' is well acted and written. In some indie films, the dialogue is so bad it's distracting. Not this one. In fact, movies in this genre can go overboard at almost any point--a rogue scientist arriving to explain everything, buckets of blood, or just a scene that goes too far and makes you laugh instead of scream. 'Teeth' deftly avoids the pitfalls. It is scary, funny, and never too much, at least not for me.This movie isn't an Oscar-worthy drama, but it could be a cult classic.

But, when I actually thought about it, I kind of liked it.I definitely thought the film had its flaws. For one, the main character, Dawn, starts out very pure, and seems bent on the idea that she must save herself for marriage. Then, it seems like she is all of the sudden so secure with herself, and just ready to have sex on a whim. It is like she goes straight from this insecure young girl to a sexual being overnight, that to me is not at all realistic. Still, I love how she becomes this jaded villain that we just know will get her revenge on all the perverted and piggish men in her way. I just saw the movie a couple days ago, and I was pretty lukewarm, but now I keep thinking about it. It was kind of haunting to be honest.

What else can I say about a movie where some chick's vagina bites off 3 dicks and 4.1 fingers? When I watched this movie, I honestly didn't know what to make of it. My first impression was ""A vagina that bites off people's dicks? ... BRILLIANT!"" But as I started to examine how they executed this concept, I noticed it seemed a little strange. I still cannot tell if the idea works or not. The way they set it up leaves me torn between laughing and wondering what is wrong with me for laughing at the movie. It feels like the directors wanted this movie to tell a dark and terrifying story and at the same time make it a spoof of itself. The hero/antihero of the story seems to discover the ability to control her teeth as the story progresses, while at the same time she also becomes far more comfortable with her sexuality. What felt a little awkward, though, was how quickly the protagonist's character changed. The film would probably have been better if it had been a little longer and given Dawn (the protagonist) more time to change from and innocent girl to a vagina-dentata-wielding warrior out to get the perverts. Also, while some of the castration scenes looked pretty realistic, reflecting the agony that someone would feel upon having his penis torn off, the scene where she bites off her stepbrother's dick seems a bit more unrealistic and almost caricatured, as though the producers were thinking ""screw realism, we want the viewers to laugh."" That being said, this movie has the most horrifying type of gore I have seen yet. It is not the clichéd, over-the-top type of gore in movies where someone get ripped to pieces and all his organs torn out, but rather the type of movie that is a little gory, but uses gory scenes where and how they will have the most effect. So I say this is the best and most creative way to use gore scenes that I have ever seen.Not the best movie ever, but it is probably a spoof of itself, so as odd as this sounds, I guess it is bad in a good way. I like the concept of turning the age-old myth of vagina dentata into a funny/scary/disturbing movie, so I guess I did like this movie. What is wrong with me. Please note that while some people may enjoy this movie, some may be much better off not watching it. If you are a woman, don't bring your boyfriend to this one, unless of course you don't want to get laid for a very long time.

It had an actual story behind it that in a twisted way is kind of warm-hearted. a weird choice of words, yes, but thats what i got out of it.The main character, Dawn, is this sweet girl who's part of a chastity group. ironic, right? anyways, she seems to meet this dream guy who's also in the group, which doesn't even believe in touching yourself. now, i'm a girl, but i understand a mans need to do what he's gotta do. its no wonder this kid ends up raping her in a cave with the excuse that he hadn't jerked off since easter. but, karma's a bitch. So, in Dawn's first encounter, she ends up biting off the guys dick, but with her vagina. isn't it genius?! But Dawn learns that if she wants the sex to happen and she enjoys it, nothing gets bitten off. But as soon as it goes sour... CHOMP.so even though its not the greatest movie in the world, you have to give props to the writers and directors, cause you'd think a premise like that would be impossible to make. i'm in awe. cause seriously! a girl with teeth in her vagina biting off guys dicks! you know whenever you go to a superhero movie, afterwards you always think about how cool it would be to have those powers? after this movie... you(well, referring to girls)kinda wish you could do that. a guys rapes you... no problem. just 'bite' that puppy off.I'd really only recommend this movie to someone for its crazy story and how well they made it seem less crazy. plus its pretty enjoyable, especially for women with hit-lists. maybe not for men though...i gave it 7 out of 10 stars.",Teeth
175,soaringpaperclip,Teeth: A comprehensive review,4,14 September 2017,"Teeth is a film released in 2007 about a young girl with teeth in her vagina. Need I say more? The whole plot centers around the folk tale of ""vagina dentata"" found in many cultures from South America to South Asia. It is a cautionary tale told to young tribesmen in which raping can lead to getting your penis bitten off. In this movie, young Dawn is a devout celibate, active in her high school's purity club (which aren't a thing I'm pretty sure). She is so resolute to this cause that she hasn't even ventured down to her own nether region to discover what lies inside. She grows up next to a nuclear plant in a broken family with a screwed up punk step brother. She views him as a sinful degenerate because he has sex with his girlfriend. Her whole belief system becomes a source of internal struggle as soon as she meets handsome Tobey, who also claims to be a ""purist"". She fantasizes but doesn't succumb to temptation as they flirt and date. They eventually venture off into the woods to a spot known for banging. Tobey is in the mood and thinks he's about to get his dick wet, however Dawn is not down and tries to stick to her core conviction. Tobey won't take the rejection and plows on only to get his johnson stuck. After a sickening crunching noise, he pulls out a bloody nub of a chode and Dawn's vagina spits out his wiener. Tobey is now dead and Dawn completely distraught and confused. Dawn doesn't tell anyone but is noticeably different, especially when she tries to speak in front of the Purity club at school. Dawn does some research on what a vagina is actually supposed to look like and discovers there's no teeth. Disturbed and even more confused she makes a trip to gynecologist only to be molested by the schemey doctor. As he is going above and beyond the call of duty inside her, the teeth attack and in a violent scene he loses his fingers. She leaves this time more disturbed than her last encounter, but determined to get to the bottom of this conundrum. After some AOL web searching, she discovers vagina dentata folk lore where the teeth need to be conquered. She turns to a douchey guy she rejected in her purity days and pops a xanny and has great consensual sex. They think it has been defeated and continue to have sex on a separate occasion. Yet again Dawn is bamboozled. Her lover answers the phone mid-bang and brags that he's ""f*cking Dawn, bro. I told you you'd lose the bet."" She gets furious when she realizes he's just doing it for a bet. The dude experiences some serious coitus interruptus when the teeth bit off his penis. At this point, Dawn is hopeless but begins to embrace her affliction. After hearing that her step brother beat and attacked her Dad. She comes home to seduce him and bits off his cock with her teeth. The movie ends with her releasing that disease has become her weapon as she hitch hikes out of town only to be trapped in a car with a creepy old man. This film can be summarized with the first line of this paper but I decided to delve deeper into the story Mitchell Lichtenstein, the director, was trying to tell and evaluate his effectiveness. ""Teeth"" is a story of Dawn's transformation from an innocent virgin to a grungy vigilante. With each victim her appearance changes; her makeup, hair, and clothes become darker and she loses innocence but gains knowledge of herself. However, there really isn't much more than that to the movie. Dawn is played by the forgettable Jess Weixler who seems to resemble every female actor in early 2000's B movies. Her performance isn't terrible but she seems to be repeating the same acting over and over. It should be noted that her transformation is impressive and subtle but that should be credited to the make up artists and other behind the scenes crew. The director did make great use of the nuclear plant and evolutionary mutation/adaptation as a motif to suggest this deformity is actually just evolution taking its course. Otherwise, I would give this movie ⅖ stars. One star for the grisly subject matter and one for the hilarious looking 3 detached penises appearing in the film. In summary, don't waste the 1 hour 37 minutes on this movie just to say you watched it.",Teeth

I saw it at the Eccles and the crowd seemed to go wild for it. There are some painful moments, and I figure now men have an idea of how uncomfortable an annual exam can be for us women. It's graphic but absolutely funny. The guy next to me said it should be mandatory viewing for middle school kids to keep them from having sex.It was fun and gross and even had a theme about taking charge of your own body and the choices that you make.It so rocked!I recommend it to everyone with a good sense of humor and a strong stomach.",Teeth
178,vigualante8,Really Shines A Light,8,12 December 2014,"I feel that this really enlightens others of the occurring problem of vaginal teeth. This ""adaptation"" destroys the manhood of men everywhere and must be stopped. I myself have fallen prey to the horror of them and I feel the loss and the pain everyday. This needs to be researched and studied before it's too late. They are slowly making their way into our world and could possibly be with you right now. If this is not stopped the world will be destroyed. We need to stop it now and save ourselves and the children. Please ladies and gentleman always look before you hook and always carry a heavy duty nail file. And please... Think of the children.",Teeth
179,LocustToybox-1,Yikes.,3,19 March 2008,"I'm not going to lie. I laughed several times at this movie, but I assure you, none of it was out of genuine amusement. It was out of the sad expectancy that once again I went to the theater managing only to see another polished turd trying to sell itself as something original and slightly satirical. I can tell it was trying to make social commentary on things like sex, fears about sex, adolescence, crap like that. But honestly, in the end it was all for shock value. It was like ""Okay, it's another severed penis, we get the point."" Anyone out there cheering this movie on is either amazingly dumb, or severely overlooking the quality of the film itself.",Teeth
180,rheaume,Teeth was actually rather impressive.,8,30 May 2008,"After just seeing this rather preachy and feministic film, I was left impressed. Sure, it starts out with the usual build up of character development and tension building. But after a while you realize that it really isn't that bad. Sure, the men are all portrayed as weak, conniving, sex-crazed animals. And some men are. To be utterly honest, I went into this with a rather closed mind. I expected a movie that was a splatter-fest with various male genitalia being rendered inoperable in gruesome ways. I was surprised. Sure, there was not one solid male performance in the entire movie. Not one strong father/brother/man figure at all. And yet the movie works. I never expected to laugh at this film, and yet I did. Very well portrayed, nothing really worth getting worked up about in the gore department, and still somewhat tastefully done. After reading all the reviews, comments, and concerns about this film I went in worried I was gonna be grossed out by a film that uses gore as entertainment. But that was not the case at all. I enjoyed this movie and would probably watch it again. Now that isn't saying it is gonna get a spot on my DVD rack, but still not bad at all...",Teeth
