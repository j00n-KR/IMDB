0,bkoganbing,The Lives And Loves Of Three Pizza Girls,9,4 October 2010,"If Mystic Pizza had been done back in the day of the studio system I can see Jack Warner thinking of this as a perfect story for the Lane Sisters. It does have the feel of Four Daughters albeit with a little more frank sexuality.Sisters Julia Roberts and Annabeth Gish and their friend Lili Taylor are the waitstaff of the best pizza parlor in Mystic, Connecticut, titled of course Mystic Pizza. Their employer Conchata Ferrall has a secret sauce that she puts on her product that's the talk of the town and several surrounding counties. Ferrall's big ambition is to have her place reviewed and rated by a snooty gourmet critic with a New England based television show, Louis Turenne.All three girls have men problems and all have different endings in their encounter. Lili Taylor can't believe that she's really got it all in Vincent Donofrio, it seems to good to be true. Julia Roberts gets herself involved with preppy Adam Storke who is out slumming with friends and ends up at her watering hole where she proceeds to take him and friends at billiards. And Annabeth Gish takes a job babysitting for William R. Moses while his wife is away and ends up falling for him.Although Mystic Pizza was Julia Roberts breakout role, I think the story of Gish and Moses is the best one. The affair is largely a product of Gish's misplaced expectations and Moses is too human to resist taking advantage of the situation. All three women end up wiser and really none the worse for the experiences.Mystic Pizza is a nice old fashioned kind of film with some really good parts for women and should be a testament to those who are writing roles for women when it is complained there aren't enough. For that matter there aren't enough roles period for all the talent out there.",Mystic Pizza
1,SnoopyStyle,The Girls did good work,7,14 September 2013,"Sisters Kat (Annabeth Gish) and Daisy (Julia Roberts) work with friend Jojo (Lili Taylor) at a local pizza place in Mystic, Connecticut. Kat is drawn to the father of the girl she is babysitting while his wife is away. Daisy falls for a rich guy who was slumming it one day at the pizza joint. Jojo passes out at her wedding, and is having second thoughts about her commitment to Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio).The girls are all great at their roles. The guys are somewhat flat. The stories are pretty traditional to have a good cry over. Although I liked that Daisy's guy didn't do the rich snob douche move.",Mystic Pizza

You'll have to wait till she retires to see if one of the girls spills the beans.This is a lighthearted fluff of a film with some present-day well known players who got an early start on stardom here, Julia Roberts and Vincent D'Onofrio chief among them. If you stay attentive during the Windsor Family dinner party, you'll even catch Matt Damon in his very first movie appearance with a single line trying to give away his 'green stuff'. No, it's not money, you'll have to catch the picture to find out.Most of the characters here are pretty much stereotypes of those you'd find in any romantic comedy/drama, given some added appeal via the scenic backdrop of Mystic, Connecticut. So intrigued was I with the mysterious name of the Eastern seaport that I made a day trip out there once. Besides checking out Mystic Pizza if you go, you really should visit the Mystic Seaport Museum of America and the Sea - it's got blue lobsters!",Mystic Pizza

You really have to look for him. Heck, everyone in the picture in young, even Vincent D'Onofrio.Although this is the film that launched Julia Roberts' career, what really stands out for me is Lili Taylor. She had such a great run in the late 80s to mid-90s, maybe a little longer. What happened? Of course, she is still around today (2016), but she seemed to be in a non-stop string of brilliant roles for a while, really redefining what it means to be an actress.",Mystic Pizza

Basically the Arujo sisters, Kat (Annabeth Gish) and Daisy (Julia Roberts), and best friend Jojo (Lili Taylor) all live out their lives in Mystic, Connecticut, where they also work at the pizza parlour. Kat is off to Yale and falling for a man she babysits for, Daisy is a tearaway wasting her time with the wrong men, Jojo leaves the man she was to marry at the altar not wanting commitment, and the pizza is gaining fame for containing a special something.

5,moonspinner55,Laughably phony...,4,28 November 2009,"Tired, cutesy-poo romantic comedy-drama concerning the love lives of three young Connecticut women who work in a homey little pizza parlor. ""Mystic Pizza"" begins with a shot of fabricated group photos featuring the central characters in happy times, the faces of the actresses clearly cut out and pasted on other bodies. It's an immediate sign that not much know-how, cleverness, or talent was used in conceptualizing this picture, which is strictly an underachiever lucky enough to gain attention after Julia Roberts' career picked up. Young, impressionable girls might find something emotionally tangible here, but seasoned moviegoers should quickly detect the artificial flavoring. Amy Holden Jones co-wrote the screenplay (based on her original story) with help from Alfred Uhry and Perry and Randy Howze, all of whom seemed to have been raised on TV. *1/2 from ****",Mystic Pizza

7,sunwarrior13,A Dated But Charming Coming-Of-Age Film,8,26 December 2011,"Three teenagers learn a lot about life and love one summer in this romantic comedy-drama film entitled,Mystic Pizza.This is also considered a coming of age film based on a pizza shop and a restaurant in Mystic, Connecticut that has been popular among both locals and tourists since 1973.It stars Annabeth Gish, Julia Roberts, and Lili Taylor together with Vincent D'Onofrio, William R. Moses, Adam Storke, and Conchata Ferrell.Matt Damon,in his screen debut,has a small part in this film.The story focuses on the coming of age of two sisters and their friend through the romantic lives of the three main characters: Kat Araujo, Daisy Araujo, and Jojo Barbosa, who are waitresses at Mystic Pizza.They are three working-class women just out of high school. Kat wants to study astronomy at Yale; when she starts baby-sitting for Tim, a wealthy Yale graduate summering in Mystic, she finds herself falling in love with him, even though he's married and nearly twice her age. Daisy, who isn't sure what she wants from life, starts going with Charlie, a recent law school dropout, though she starts to think that it may be more to rebel against her family than out of genuine affection. And Jojo is attracted to Bill, but she doesn't want to get married since she's already left him at the altar once; when Bill announces that he's no longer willing to have sex without marriage, she has to decide if his affections are worth a lifetime commitment.There is also a dynamic between Kat's Anglo-American employer and the resulting relationship between them. The class distinctions and variant European heritages are explored in various scenesThis is one of the most charming coming of age films ever shown as it was honest and sincere especially with issues in love and sex faced by the three major characters in the film. Aside from that,it's laced with humor and well-acted, and the beautiful Julia Roberts,who shows strong potential for becoming a major star in her first substantial role.The only thing about it is that this film is somewhat dated for present viewers for it was made particularly with characterizations for film that were made during the 1980's,the decade it was released.",Mystic Pizza

9,jotix100,What's the secret ingredient in the pizza?,7,9 January 2006,"Pizza, that delicious Italian dish has been adapted by people all over the world into their own way to express their interpretation about the way it should taste. It's not surprising that in Mystic, Ct., where there's a large Portuguese population, Leona, the owner of the Mystic Pizza restaurant has created a concoction that is admired by everyone. Don't ask her to reveal her ingredients because she will not tell you.Daniel Petrie, the director, takes us along for a ride to this coastal town in which Amy Jones' story is set. We meet the three friends that work in the restaurant, Jojo, Daisy and Kat; the last two are sisters. Jojo is intense, but has a problem accepting the fact that Bill, her fiancé, wants to formalize their engagement. In the opening scenes we watch as Jojo faints in the church where she is marrying Bill. Panic strikes and she jilts him.Daisy, is a beautiful girl who appears to be grounded. When Charlie, the preppy guy finds her at a local bar, it seems he is quite taken by her. Daisy, who should have known better embarks in a love affair with this young which one realizes is doomed from the start. Not only are they from two different worlds, but romances like these are just a passing fancy for wealthy boys. So is the involvement with the wise and intelligent Kat with Tim, the young father with a child who needs a sitter. Kat will be hurt in thinking Tim will want her over the absent wife.""Mystic Pizza"" is about the friendship of the three local girls and their way of looking at life from different angles. Annabeth Gish makes a great appearance in the film with her Kat. Lili Taylor is also good as Jojo. This was a film that presented Julia Roberts that hinted at her success as a movie actress. The rest of the cast plays well in the film. Vincent D'Onofrio, William Moses, Adam Storker and Conchata Farrell do good work under Mr. Petrie's direction. Seen in a small role that if one blinks, one would miss him, is Matt Damon making his first screen appearance.",Mystic Pizza
10,preppy-3,"One of the best ""chick flicks""",8,25 March 2004,"Movie about three young waitresses who work at Mystic Pizza in Mystic CT. Good girl Kat (Annabeth Gish)is going to college and falls in love with a married man (William Moses). Her sister, bad girl Daisy (Julia Roberts), falls in love with rich kid Charles (Adam Storke). And Jojo (Lili Taylor) is deeply in love with Bill (Vincent D'Onorfrio) but is afraid to marry him...which he wants. Pretty predictable but still lots of fun. This was released with no fanfare in 1988 (Roberts was still unknown and there were no 'name' actors in the cast) and went on to become a surprise hit. That shouldn't be a shock--this is the type of movie that isn't really challenging or deep. You know the characters, you know the situations and you know it's going to have a happy ending. Still, there's nothing wrong with a film like that if it's entertaining and well-done--and this one is.The script is lively and it was beautifully shot on location in CT (in Mystic and other towns). Gish is just great (and top-billed) in the movie. She was also 17 (the age of her character too) so it adds to the realism. Taylor is good but has little to do. Her character is very one note and ALWAYS yapping about commitment. Roberts is good but her character is TERRIBLE! Foul-mouthed, obnoxious and grating--her verbal abuse of her sister Kat is more than vicious. I really hated her! Nevertheless, this movie jump started her career. D'Onorfrio (a wonderful character actor) is given nothing to do but look handsome and hunky--which he does. Storke is VERY good-looking and gives a great performance as a rich kid--what ever happened to him? And Moses is just OK as a married man. Add Conchata Ferrell as the pizza store owner and Matt Damon in a one line role in his film debut. A real nice, pleasing little movie. Perfectly catches the small town feeling too. Worth seeing. But don't let Roberts' face on the box fool you--it's NOT her movie.",Mystic Pizza

13,gradyharp,One of the Old Standards,8,13 January 2006,"It's hard to believe that this little 1988 film has endured in popularity for so long. It is a simple story of three 'sisters' in the small fishing village of Mystic, CT who have just graduated high school, work as waitress in the town Mystic Pizza parlor, and face decisions about the future of their lives. There are three less than fairytale romances with three male characters of varying potential as partners and it is the 'coming of age' in a small Portuguese clan that sparks the tenderness and the sadness of this story written by Amy Holden Jones and directed by Donald Petrie.One of the most interesting aspects of this low budget film is how it catapulted Julia Roberts and Matt Damon (who plays such a bit part he nearly goes unnoticed) to fame, reinforced the careers of fine character actors Conchata Ferrell, Lili Taylor and Vincent D'Onofrio while pushing the then promising Annabeth Gish, William R. Moses and Adam Storke over into TV land roles.The film is a bit of nostalgia for a better time, has charm and innocence, and will always be one of those movies everyone who is a film collector will keep in their library for times when a return to simple little movies just makes you feel good.

14,mm-39,Won't be on movies for guys who like movies,7,14 May 2004,"Won't be on movies for guys who like movies!  The antithesis for Magnum Froce.  No Client Eastwood or Hal Halbrook in this film.  Hey no one even gets killed.  Saw this at my sisters former boyfriend house.  Did not mind it either, than I saw it again years later, with by wife, on late night.  My wife like this film, and I found it aged well.  The acting is alright, but its the story that keeps, this action movie junkie, interested.  The story reminds me of a few of the interesting conversation I would have with my female friends at the university.  Funny how a jucie story can transend gender, age and other demographics.  The end is a bit sappy, but it had too have a downer ending that would have killed this movie.  I wish they had a litte more about the Pizza.  Funny, right about this movie makes me want to order one.  I give this film 7 pizza's out of 10, if it is 2 for 1 then 14 out of 20. Mike",Mystic Pizza
15,JamesHitchcock,Zen and the Art of Pizza Making,6,3 April 2010,"The title sounds intriguing, a sort of ""Zen and the Art of Pizza Making"". ""Mystic Pizza"", however, has nothing to do with mysticism. The ""mystic"" is a reference to the small town of Mystic, Connecticut, and the three main characters all work as waitresses at the town's pizza restaurant. The three are sisters Kat and Daisy Araujo and their friend Jojo Barboza. All come from the town's large Portuguese-American community, and all are in their late teens or early twenties. All are romantically involved, and the film traces the stories of their romances. Kat is the intellectual of the group; she has been accepted to attend Yale University and, besides her work at the restaurant, also acts as babysitter for a thirty-something Yale graduate named Tim whose wife is currently in Europe. She falls heavily for Tim after discovering that they have intellectual interests in common and cherishes the hope that he will leave his wife for her. · Daisy's love-interest is Charles Gordon Winsor junior, the son of a wealthy WASP family. Although the Winsors are ""new"" rather than ""old"" money, they have all the snobbish instincts of the most aristocratic blue-bloods, and disapprove of their son's romance with a girl who is ""ethnic"", a Roman Catholic and from a working-class background. (The comments about Daisy's ethnicity did not really ring true; the Winsors seem to regard Portuguese-Americans in much the same light as particularly unenlightened British colonialists used to regard the ""natives"", even though there have been Portuguese communities in the New England fishing ports for several generations). This sort of conflict is a commonplace in romantic dramas; the relationship between Charles and Daisy parallels almost exactly that between the rich WASP boy Oliver and the poor Italian Catholic girl Jenny in ""Love Story"". Here, however, the situation is given an unusual twist. After Charles engineers a confrontation with his family over a perceived insult to Daisy, she is perceptive enough to realise that his interest in her has less to do with love than with a self-conscious act of rebellion against his privileged background. Unwilling to be used as a weapon in his private battle against his family, she ends the relationship, although a more conventional romance would have presented Charles' outburst as something admirable and provided the expected ""happy-ever-after"" ending. Of the three romances, in fact, two end unhappily. Rather more predictably, at least in terms of adherence to dramatic conventions, Kat discovers too late that Tim has simply been using her and has no intention of leaving his wife for her. The one story that does end happily is that of Jojo, although even here normal Hollywood conventions are given a new twist. Jojo is engaged to Bill, a local fisherman, but is reluctant to commit herself to him in marriage. This is a reversal of the normal movie cliché in which it is the male characters who are portrayed as being frightened of emotional commitment. Bill (whose strong religious beliefs preclude sex before marriage) wants to get married as soon as possible, but Jojo doesn't believe she is ready. In his review of the film, written when it first came out in1988, Roger Ebert stated ""I have a feeling that ""Mystic Pizza"" may someday become known for the movie stars it showcased back before they became stars."" Of the three leads it was Annabeth Gish as Kat, whom he singled out for special mention, comparing her to a ""young Katharine Hepburn."" Gish is certainly good, but for me the star of the film was the still little-known Julia Roberts, who shows here not only the looks and the talent but also the charisma which were to make her a major star a couple of years later in films like ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Sleeping with the Enemy"". Lili Taylor as Jojo does not perhaps have quite the same impact, but there are some good contributions from some of the minor characters, especially Conchata Ferrell as Leona, the owner of the restaurant who claims to be in possession of a secret recipe for pizza sauce which she has inherited from her forebears on the Algarve. (And there was me thinking pizza was an Italian dish rather than a Portuguese one). Adam Storke as the spoilt rich boy Charles is the best of the male stars. The film has been described as a romantic comedy, although it does not follow the normal format of the standard Hollywood rom-com. A better description would probably be a coming-of-age story, set against a well-realised background of small- town life. In a traditional romantic comedy the main focus of interest would be Jojo finding the love of her life; here the focus is on all three characters learning lessons about life. As Ebert put it, it's about three girls discovering what their standards for love are going to be. This is not exactly an original theme, but ""Mystic Pizza"" adds enough original touches to keep it interesting. 6/10",Mystic Pizza
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,Julia's big break,6,17 September 2007,"The funny thing is that I'm a girl and it's rare that I like a chick flick, I've found a few that I really like and some that I'm cool with. Mystic Pizza I'm cool with, just the fact that there's nothing wrong with the film. It's Julia's big break in films, that big hair, that dazzling smile, I think people knew she was going to be big. I started watching Mystic Pizza with my mom a while back when it was on TV, but we never finished it, I have to admit, it kept my attention. So I rented it the other day and just watched it a few minutes ago. It was a very cute film and a charming story for girls who know that it's time to grow up. I think the reason I enjoyed this film is that right now I can relate to these girls when they know they're going through major changes in their lives that they have to accept and go with. The story is one that I think most girls can relate too.Kat, Daisy, and Jojo are three girls who have grown up together and work together at Mystic Pizza. Jojo is afraid of marrying her long time boyfriend. Kat is having romantic fantasies of the married man who's daughter she is babysitting. Daisy is having a wild romance with the money of the States, Charles. Together they face the hard times of having to grow up and face the world. But they know that if they stick together, they can make it through the tough times.Mystic Pizza is a decent movie really. There's nothing wrong with it, there are some funny moments and some one's that make you shed a tear, it's a chick flick, what can you do? But I would recommend it for a good flick, so far this is actually the only Julia Roberts flick that I have really enjoyed so far. But I think I loved Lili Tyler's character the most, she was so cute and funny. I loved it when her parents walked in on her and her boyfriend, it's such a situation that most can relate too. So go and give this a look, it's a good movie.7/10",Mystic Pizza

20,PredragReviews,Julia Roberts at her best!,7,5 May 2016,"This ""sleeper"" hit looks just as good today as it did when it was first released. It follows the trials and tribulations of three childhood friends. They all work as waitresses in a pizza parlor and all are at a crossroad in their life. Kat (Annabeth Gish) is preparing to leave home for Yale to begin a career in Astronomy. Daisey (Julia Roberts) Kat's sister, seems to be floundering, with no real direction to go in life, and JoJo (Lili Taylor, who gives the film's most comedic performance), is torn between her love for her fiancé Bill, and settling down into a married life filled with screaming kids and massive weight gain.The film integrates all three stories and keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace. All three friends have very different personalities, allowing most of the audience to be able to identify with at least one of them. I will admit, however, that the ultra idealistic, goodie-goodie Kat does get on my nerves from time to time. (I particularly enjoyed the scene where Daisey hauls off and belts her across the face). The chemistry between the leads works extremely well which only strengthens the movie. Roberts gives a strong performance and shows the audience the first signs of the Hollywood powerhouse she would soon become. The three leads are admirabley backed up by a strong supporting cast as well, most notably, Conchata Ferrell as the owner of the pizza parlor. All in all, a very sweet movie about real people and real family situations, and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I literally never tire of this modern classic. My only quibble is that the last spoken line is disturbingly unimaginative and anti-climactic. After crafting such a superb screenplay, the writers just seemed to run out of inspiration at the last hurdle. As Mr. Spock would say, ""Fascinating."" Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Mystic Pizza
21,MartianOctocretr5,This pizza tastes more like cardboard,3,30 August 2009,"The cornball cutesie-cutesie title is the least of this film's problems. It's another coming-of-age story, where teens have romantic encounters, and learn about harsh realities of life because everything goes wrong in those encounters. That can be a good or bad formula, depending on what the writer and director do with it. This ""Pizza"" is cooked up with cardboard cutouts; consequently ending up as hard to swallow as cardboard.The plot is utterly predictable, and slammed down your throat with about as much subtlety in its approach as the coming-of-age of an atomic bomb. And what a bomb this is. The film tries to be a romantic comedy in spots with awkward exaggeration; this also fails. The only saving grace of this movie is the always dependable Annabeth Gish. But she is surrounded by unbelievably bad co-stars. Julia Roberts is; well, Julia Roberts, and that is not a good thing (to be fair, she does appear to at least be trying). The overacting guys that run in and out are inept and annoying. The person playing the third waitress apparently was never heard from again. The film ends nowhere, pretty much where it started.Where do they get the gimmicky so-deep-and-clever title? To rope in box office dollars of course--in the story, a pizza parlor. And a town. Are they kidding? Ugh. There's nothing mystic about it. Mystic Pizza tastes bland and stale.",Mystic Pizza
22,Spuzzlightyear,Extra Cheese Please!,6,13 August 2005,"Mystic Pizza is a movie I had immediate suspicions about from the very beginning of the movie, when Julia Roberts makes her entry to the movie in a bar and plops herself down on a bar stool. I noticed.. quickly.. her HUGE hair. And then Adam Storke enters the movie, and my god, I just about keeled over laughing. Wearing the most ridiculous jacket that hasn't been seen, well, since the late 80's when this film was made, collar up and with a somewhat effeminate look about him. It's very odd and it just distracted me throughout the movie. Oh right, about now the cheesy 80's synthesizer squawk song comes up as well, so this movie instantly arrives at 80's kitsch supreme, and the movie is just 5 minutes old! This movie follows a theme we've all seen before. AKA, women trying to find the love of their life while trying to make sense out of like (See Shag, Satisfaction, Three Coins In The Fountain, etc). Lilli Taylor plays a woman who's not too sure whether she wants to get married to Vincent D'Onofrio or not (Yes, I can understand that). Annabeth Gish plays a girl who makes some extra money babysitting and falls in love with a married man who's wife has gone overseas, and Julia Roberts is a somewhat ""let the chips fall where they may"" type of gal who yes, beds the rich Storke, and realizes that, shockers upon shockers, The Rich People Don't Care For The Lower Class! All of these women for some odd stupid reason don't seem to GET it. What exactly was making Taylor so neurotic about marriage? Why is Gish so shocked when the married guy's wife comes home? Who on earth would pick up Adam Storke? All of this, and yes, Matt Damon too! In his first movie role! I didn't realize this until I was watching it that he was in it, playing Adam Storke's brother. It's sort of fun to think that the next time you would see them on screen together would be Oceans 11, a full 13 years after this was made! Yikes!",Mystic Pizza

24,CitizenCaine,Early Film For Young Ensemble Cast Charms,6,26 April 2004,"This sleeper hit from the Fall of 1988 has real charm. The film is about three girls that are becoming young women; two of them are sisters. Lili Taylor plays a girl that wants sex, but can't commit to marriage. Now there's a twist. Annabeth Gish and Julia Roberts, in an early important role for her, are the sisters. Gish has an idealized romance in her head regarding the 30 year old Yale graduate she babysits for, whose wife is conveniently in Europe. Does it make an affair seem more acceptable when the wife is further away? Roberts plays a girl, like she did in her first credited film Satisfaction, who uses her body to get what she wants. The girls are all fine; however, Gish's scenario is less interesting than the other two and is somewhat clichéd. Vincent D'Onofrio is good in his few scenes as Taylor's would be husband. William R. Moses and Adam Storke are less compelling as the male interests of Gish and Roberts respectively. The film's strengths are its ability to portray the charms of small town life, and being set in a pizzeria operated by Conchata Ferrell with the girls sharing their hopes and dreams. There are several scenes that are funny and genuine, such as D'Onofrio being chased by Taylor's father one night, Roberts scene with Storke when she miscalculates who he is with, and the visit by the gourmet reviewer to the pizzeria. The film is pretty much formulaic with a few ironic twists in the female characters, and this is certainly inferior to other films of the coming of age, gal pal genre, but it has its own charm, entertains us, and is interesting enough for the early appearances of its young stars alone.

It is a great family film for everyone to enjoy. I'm watching it now for the first time as we speak. Mystic Pizza has an excellent unrestricting flowing story. The story can lead you seemingly anywhere while within its close to home setting. It's very well-written. It's certainly a lasting 80s classic and a sneaky hit. Julia Roberts is unbelievable in it. She is young and sensational. I'm reminded of my undying love for Julia watching her now in Mystic Pizza. Oh my God, she is so beautiful! I love Julia! She's like, my fav. I love seeing Lili Taylor in her first breakout role. I have always held the utmost respect for Lili's true ability to act since I first laid eyes on her and she's so pretty. I'm not too familiar with the lesser known Annabeth Gish but she is very warm and welcoming and very lovely. Mystic Pizza has great ensemble characters. Mystic Pizza hits close to the heart. Mystic Pizza has become a very popularly beloved movie over time and Julia Roberts is to die for in it. As the ending rolls on this heartwarming coming of age, pizza slice of life movie, I realize Mystic Pizza was very good.",Mystic Pizza
26,Tito-8,"Flawed, but good enough",7,5 August 1999,"Although it has a fairly predictable story and a few slow spots, I would still say that this was a good movie.  This is almost completely because of the reliable Annabeth Gish and her character Kat, since I never really cared for Daisy or Jojo.  Besides Kat's numerous scenes, there were also several funny moments that helped me to overlook the routine plot.  It's not great by any stretch, but it's certainly a worthwhile time killer.",Mystic Pizza

Many people make choices for themselves based on their believed socioeconomic status, even though none of that stuff is real.

Their friend was set to marry her fiancé, but she fails to go through with it despite the fact the she still wants him.

30,roghache,Entertaining chick flick about three girls' romantic woes,6,29 March 2006,"This is an entertaining enough movie, definitely a chick flick. Call me old fashioned, but I'm going to start out by putting in my disclaimer that it isn't in any way ideal (or even okay) that these young girls are all sleeping with guys they aren't married to. I wouldn't want my daughter (if I had one) having their morals.The story revolves around three friends who have just graduated from high school in Mystic, Connecticut, and work as waitresses in the local pizza parlor during the summer, while trying to sort out their future plans. Two of these girls, Daisy and Kat, are sisters and bridesmaids to the third, Jojo, who faints at the altar and wants to postpone any commitment. Jojo's fiancé wants marriage now and eventually more or less gives her an ultimatum. Meanwhile, her two friends (the sisters) are having romantic problems of their own. Daisy, the wild, cocky sister, is dating (and bedding) a handsome, wealthy, and rather spoiled young man named Charlie. Her brainy, quiet sister, Kat, is headed for Yale, but has a summer job babysitting a little girl. She has fallen for her charge's 30 something year old dad, whose wife is off in England for the summer.They're all having sex at around age 17 -18, and not putting a lot of either smarts or honour into it. Jojo literally can't seem to get enough sex, but doesn't want to marry the guy. Though she's portrayed sympathetically, Daisy's apparently been sleeping around long before Charlie. Kat has sex with a married man, regretting it afterward only because she feels dumb and used when he returns to his wife. (She WAS dumb and used.) No remorse whatsoever over her ill treatment of said absent wife or betrayal of the couple's child she claims to feel such affection for. We're supposed to feel sorry for her (and do), but it's not quite nice what she did, especially in light of the fact that it's so premeditated over a period of time, not spur of the moment at all.As for Jojo, it's a little odd that she just seems to want sex (even in the pizzeria washroom!), whereas it's her fiancé who's the honorable one wanting to commit, possibly even for religious reasons. He's tired of them sneaking around to have sex. Hurray for him! I had rather limited sympathy for Jojo's situation; many girls wish they were so lucky. I agree with the reviewer who claims Jojo's an annoyance, always yapping away about commitment. Although Daisy comes off as mouthy and rude, sometimes even cruel to her sister, she shows her vulnerability as the blue collar girl looked down upon by Charlie's snobbish family. My main sympathy goes to Kat, even though she indeed does a terrible thing, and quite unrepentantly at that, by sleeping with her married employer. However, she's young, naive, and foolish...neither the first nor the last...and alas, suffers for her folly eventually.It's one of Julia Robert's early roles, and she always emerges sympathetically, including here as Daisy, the stereotypical low social status girl with Portuguese ethnic roots, in love with a rich, preppy WASP college man. The other cast all come off quite adequately, especially Annabelle Gish who shines as Kat. I agree with others who have noted that, Julia Roberts notwithstanding, this is really Kat's movie.The pizza parlor is sort of home base to the tale. One of the most touching aspects of this movie is the camaraderie and loyalty of these girls to Leona, the pizzeria owner. Leona has no kids, so the three girls are like her daughters. It's interesting when the gourmet food critic stops in for a slice of Leona's secret recipe pizza!Anyway, this movie is an entertaining little bit of fluff, but definitely one just for the girls, I would say.",Mystic Pizza

32,macpherr,The atmosphere and friendship between all of them makes MysticPizza a fun movie.,6,31 May 1999,"Directed by Donald Petrie (Grumpy Old Men, The Favor) this is a story that portrays a minority group, as normal people. I got the tape because of Julia Roberts, and to my surprise there was this wedding with this man singing in Portuguese. I went like what!!! I understand this: Oh, this is Portuguese! What a pleasant surprise! The Luso-Portuguese is nice and  Lili Taylor (Born on the Fourth of July), Jojo, singing a lullaby to a child is just a sweet moment.  It is true that there is a large population of Portuguese fishermen in that part of the US. Three Portuguese/ American girls work in this pizzeria in Mystic, Connecticut. Annabeth Gish (Beautiful Girls, Nixon) is Kat the intelligent sister who is going to Yale who also babysits. Jojo, who is my favorite character, and Daisey, Julia Roberts (Notting Hill, Something to Talk About, Pretty Woman). Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black) Bill, is Jojo's fiancé.  Jojo runs from the altar because she is afraid of commitment. Jojo's thinks like the average man. She loves him but does not want to loose her identity. They have a great sex life and Bill says that Jojo is only after his body. Sounds just like a girl talking!They all work for Conchata Ferrell (L.A. Law, My Fellow Americans) who is the pizzeria owner, and  has this secret mix for the pizza. The girls are like her daughters since she has no kids. Kat so smart, unfortunately ends up having an affair with a married man William R. Moses (""Falcon Crest""), Tim  and cries her eye ball's out. Girl, what did you expect! Daisy falls for a rich law student. Jojo ends up marrying Bill. Favorite scenes: Jojo singing the lullaby, Daisey filling up her boy friend's car with fish and junk. The little delivery pizzeria car is a painted ex US Mail - truck, which is adorable! The food critic, and the dentures in the glass of water. The atmosphere and friendship between all of them makes Mystic Pizza a fun movie. This is not a super - intellectual type of movie, but a nice story about three young women. I have the tape and enjoy watching it. It is just fun!",Mystic Pizza
33,SamJamie,"Cheesy, topped with romance & rises to the occasion",9,14 June 2020,"Mystic Pizza is a 1988 American coming-of-age film directed by Donald Petrie and starring Annabeth Gish, Julia Roberts, and Lili Taylor. Jojo, Daisy and Kat work at a pizza outlet and face complications in their respective love lives till they find a perfect match.Mystic Pizza is a marvelously warm and funny comedy-drama that is frankly sentimental but never cloying. Thanks to sensitive direction by Petrie, the result is a thoroughly involving movie that doesn't resort to violence, sex or schmaltz to pack an emotional punch. This delightful comedy-drama also gave the luminous Roberts her first substantial role.I think this is one of the most charming coming of age movies ever made and is one of the rare ""chick flicks"" built on wit and sincerity ... as opposed to cliche and artifice. ""Mystic Pizza"" does create the feeling of a small resort town and the people who live there and, amazingly, given the familiar nature of a lot of the material, it nearly always keeps us interested, it's a genuine and moving film.",Mystic Pizza
34,herbqedi,2 out of 3 ain't bad,7,5 July 2002,"Mystic Pizza is a pleasant-but-slow slice-of-life comedy-drama.  It centers on the lives of 3 young waitresses in a Pizza Parlor in blue-collar Mystic, CT.  The parlor's owner is a hard-scrabble-with-heart-of-gold Portuguese ""princess"" buoyantly portrayed by Conchata Farrell.  She makes the scene where the food critic tastes her pizza the most memorable in the movie.
As for the girls, two of the three stories work well.  Lili Taylor is a revelation as the fun-loving JoJo coming to terms with the cliche her life is and how to come to terms with the love she feels for stalwart-but-limited Bill, winningly portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio (now of Law and Order: CI). These two light up the screen with humor and awkward aplomb.  Julia Roberts puts her raw-but-winning talent on display as the blue-collar Daisy, a student-teacher in the school of hard-knocks.The one unfortunate element is that the movie spends far too much time on a nowhere relationship between Annibelle Gish and preppy husband-away-from his wife portrayed by the affable but feckless William R. (aka Billy) Moses. This story just makes the movie drag.But overall, Mystic Pizza is a kind of young-woman-oriented Diner, amiable, fun, and chock-full of young talent.",Mystic Pizza

36,JackCerf,Three Girls In A Pizzeria,7,19 December 2015,"There is a genre known as the Three Girls Movie, in which, you guessed it, three girls learn about Life, which really means Men, and about themselves along the way. There is always a heroine, a naive, vulnerable one who gets hurt, and an eccentric one, who might be either wild or salty. Three Coins In a Fountain is a Three Girls Movie; so is The Best of Everything, and Where The Boys Are (although they threw in Connie Francis as a fourth so that she could sing). How to Marry a Millionaire is also a Three Girls Movie, with the twist that the three girls are grown women -- fashion models -- who already consider themselves fully wised up about Life and Men and find out they are wrong.Mystic Pizza is a very good Three Girls Movie, notable for launching the careers of the Three Actresses: Julia Roberts, of course, and to a lesser extent Lily Taylor and Annabeth Gish. They play three working class waitresses in a New England fishing town. Gish, the booksmart but naive one, gets seduced and abandoned by an older married man but will go off to Yale better armored against the snares of the world. Taylor, the wild one, finally accepts her place in working class Mystic as the heir apparent to the pizzeria and its secret sauce and the wife of the fisherman who has loved her all along. Roberts, the gorgeous, hot tempered but deeply sensible heroine, finds a rich guy who turns out to be badly flawed, but curably flawed; at the end she is making this spoiled rich pretty boy over into the man who will deserve her. There are no real surprises here (except for one involving a misunderstanding and a parked convertible with the top down), and it's not great art by any means, but it is a very well-executed variation of a reliable formula that should entertain anyone, or at least any female, from 13 on up.",Mystic Pizza
37,kayaker36,Subtle but noticeable anti-male bias,6,28 April 2010,"There are no black, no Latino characters in this movie. In the town of Mystic the underclass are the ""Portagee"" (descendants of immigrant Portuguese) , well down the social ladder from the wealthy WASPs of the Connecticut Gold Coast.Annabeth Gish and Julia Roberts are cast as sisters but are in no way alike. Julia Roberts' character is aggressive, brassy, sexually loose. Her sister is the ingénue, bookish--headed for Yale on a partial scholarship--shy, virginal, maternal.Vincent D'Onofrio shows some of the range and talent that would later bring him a solid career in films and especially as the brilliantly eccentric Det. Bobby Goren on the long- running ""Law & Order-Criminal Intent"" TV series. His character is quite sympathetic, even sensitive though his partners on the fishing boat are all bull-necked, beer-swilling louts.The other two young, male characters come off far worse--and this seems to have harmed the careers of two then-promising actors. Blond, ivy league patrician William R. Moses, reminiscent of the young William Hurt, is portrayed as a cad for having had a brief affair with the Annabeth Gish character whom he has quite innocently hired to care for his young daughter (a real charmer) while his wife is off pursuing her career overseas. But the seduction is mutual, symbolized by young Annabeth ringing out the words ""I'll have some wine"" after the man offers her soft drinks.Maybe it's his name but the career of Adam Storke (sic) didn't go far, either. Here he plays a ne'er-do-well from a wealthy family. But he is not snobbish like his mother and aunt. His feelings for the Julia Roberts character are sincere. It is she who abuses him, first by playing a very nasty and destructive prank when she mistakenly believes he is out with another girl and later upbraiding him after he defends her at an elegant dinner party at his parents' home.On the good side, the pacing of the film is lively and features a riveting performance by Julia Roberts, when she still was relatively unknown.",Mystic Pizza

40,knowyourmovie,An enjoyable and funny coming of age story with a good message,7,6 August 2012,"""There are forty kinds of lunacy but only one kind of common sense"" - a proverb says. It appears that, similarly to modern politics, today's cinema tends to be polluted by aberrations of a certain kind - the aggressive, pervasive, and loud extremes representing a nasty insult to the common sense. Moreover, the once distinct line between the mainstream and the extreme appears to have blurred. Many mainstream movies can now be considered to be extreme in a certain sense while independent movies have grown so numerous, popular, well-organized, and influential that they managed to successfully form their own local ""mainstream"".On one end of the specter reside many of the popular mainstream movies. Being predominately designed for the viewers with the mental capacity of a twelve year old and the moral awareness of Pinocchio before he became a boy, these are intellectual disasters and moral failures also lacking logic, vision, imagination, authenticity, good taste and all the remaining qualities of a decent movie.On the other end, often obscure, pretentious, artificial, abstract, and whimsical, independent movies nowadays can be just as unsubstantial and inauthentic as most mainstream movies are. ""Mystic pizza"" - not a perfect movie by any means - comes across as naturally enjoyable, funny, emotional, and captivating precisely because it deals with the real life issues familiar to most people. It resides in the real world on planet Earth and not in one of the superficial, artificially enhanced imaginary universes that serve homes to so many movies, both mainstream and independent.Secondly, ""Mystic pizza"" is a rare case of a movie that offers a good message without being forceful, contentious, or didactic. Just by telling its simple but touching and engaging coming of age story of three likable girls with all the challenges that they face, choices that they make, and mistakes that they learn on, ""Mystic pizza"" manages to unobtrusively deliver a few simple life truths that appear to be easily discounted and overlooked by both mainstream and independent cinema. I think it never hurts to be reminded of such timeless truths as ""true love is inseparable from honesty, commitment, and sacrifice"", ""an affair is morally wrong, painful, and destructive"", or ""hard work brings you dignity that money cannot buy"".The three blue-collar girls from a small New England town of Mystic – genuine, hardworking, responsible, caring, strong and independent but overall respectful to their parents could serve as a positive role model for many modern teens. Unfortunately, the girls from the movie also represent a stark contrast to the ever-increasing number of self-obsessed, lazy, spoiled, irresponsible, immature young adults, who appear to be unprepared for the real world challenges and somehow end up being both hopelessly dependent on their parents and disrespectful to them at the same time.In 1989, ""Mystic pizza"" earned a well-deserved Independent Spirit award for the Best First Feature. The movie still remains among the best works of its writer Amy Holden Jones and its director Donald Petrie who have both gone mainstream since then. Amy Holden Jones is now mostly known for the ""Beethoven"" franchise, whereas Donald Petrie seems to have been recently focusing on the quite lightweight, purely entertaining formulaic comedies like ""Miss Congeniality"", ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", or ""My Life in Ruins"".In addition to the good story and the solid directing, ""Mystic pizza"" offers almost perfect casting and generally strong acting, both ensemble and individual. The movie happens to be one of the first full-length features with Julia Roberts (Daisy Arujo). Right from the beginning, it becomes clear that Ms. Roberts has a remarkable talent – something that she successfully proved in many movies that followed.Annabeth Gish and Lili Taylor were charming and convincing in the roles of the two other teen girls - Kat Arujo and Jojo. Vincent D'Onofrio delivered a strong supporting performance as Jojo's fiancé Bill - a simple (but not an ordinary) fisherman. Adam Storke was able to find all the right accents for the role of the carefree and easygoing rich kid Charles Gordon Windsor, Jr., Daisy's love interest. Joanna Merlin was perfect in a small role of Mrs. Arujo - Kat's and Daisy's wise hardworking mother.Despite being rated ""R"" (mostly because of some language and sensuality), ""Mystic pizza"" seems to feature less questionable or offensive content than many of the more recent ""PG-13"" movies. It is a good chick-flick and a good date movie. It is also one of those movies that might be worth watching together with your high school age kids as a good illustration to the difficult choices that they will soon (or might already) be facing, conflicting feelings that they will soon (or might already) be experiencing, and hard decisions that they will soon (or might already) be making.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",Mystic Pizza

42,scoobydoo-29055,My friend owns the restaurant :) no real spoilers!,8,25 February 2021,"I was supposed to be an extra in this movie when it came out back in 88' as I grew up in this town No one knew any actors names in the movie including Matt Damon or Julia Roberts and all the rest of the crew....well look now. So many great ones came out of this flick. It's not a 10/10 but it's not boring either. Just your typical 80s coming of age story. My review really has no spoilers just facts- just wanted to be safe saying it does so they don't erase itFun facts: This movie wasn't even filmed inside mystic pizza. It was filmed mostly in stonington CT about 5 miles away in a restaurant they renamed mystic pizza, as the real one at the time, was too small and the owner wouldn't close it for filming for the whole summer. Many of the outside scenes were filmed in downtown mystic at the mystic draw bridge and the scenes with them in the Porsche etc.The script is decent but I caught so many repetitive stereotype mistakes in it. Like everyone just eats lobster day and night every day and Portuguese girls are poor. It's still a good movie to watch at home on Netflix right now during the pandemic if you never saw it. Definite chick flick. My high school buddy still owns the restaurant today and it's now 4x the size of the one in the movie. Some of the writing shows how this town is....some local bar hopping fishermen type mixed in with some rich preppy teens with their collared shirts up driving Porsche's. I was one of them. I even worked for the dealership that supplied the Porsche 911. :DBut the movie kept showing everyone eating lobster all the time...breakfast, lunch and dinner leftovers in the fridge and again when Julia Roberts went to the guys house for dinner.... she looked disgusted at ...more lobster again..Completely false. No one up there eats lobsters all day and night all the time and not during winter and fall. It's more like a summer treat as in someone going out and eating a steak dinner once in a while on a holiday.. . The writer made it look like thats all people eat there besides pizza lol. Not.I noticed all the planted lobster signs all over in the movie as well. Abbott's lobster...fords lobster (by the way they are only 2 fresh seafood places in the whole entire town) ..and especially the fake lobster sign in the scene when all the girls are at the draw bridge next to Noyes dry goods (no longer there). That wasn't even a lobster restaurant. It was a place called johns cafe and a barber shop and there has never been a lobster sign on it. . I didn't like that they tried to make mystic look like it's just a bunch of lobster heads. As a matter of fact the waterway at the bridge is known for water skiing and yachting to long island NY, fishers island and block island...not lobster fishing like you see in the movie. Lobsters come mostly from Maine not mystic ct... The town is actually very old school rich and classy like the Hampton's. Zero crime or close to it.The other part of the writing I didn't like was them kinda stereotyping/mocking the Portuguese. One person that wrote a review on this movie said he liked the fact that this was filmed in a Portuguese town and everyone in the movie was Portuguese?. Lol No it isn't and no they aren't. . Mystic is predominately 92% white and only 1.5% Hispanic. The writing and dialogue made Julia roberts seem like she was 'below' the rich people being a broke Portuguese girl when in fact growing up in the town there was 1 Portuguese girl in the only high school for this town when this movie was written. As a matter of fact my brother dated this girl who not only was hot and looked like Julia Roberts, but was also middle to upper class and lived closer to the water than the rich family portrayed in this movie. . . So I don't get what the broke Portuguese girl was all about. Being Portuguese and broke don't go together whatsoever in this town. 100% inaccurate and poor writing on this part.Recommend watching it on Netflix as it's currently on there. Kinda reminds me of the 80s coming of age flick the last American virgin. Hope you liked my being a local critique.Ps. Everyone asking what's in the secret sauce? Nothing The sauce is not good anymore. My friend changed it from his dads original recipe from the 70s/ 80s when they started selling frozen pizzas at Costco. :(
To the person that wrote a review on this movie 25 plus reviews below... who.named dropped the owners name as ""Leona"" you're dead wrong. The owners name is Chris Z.

My main interest in the film comes from the fact that I grew up on the Connecticut shoreline about 45 minutes from Mystic. So there was a lot of nostalgia from that. I heard this was actually filmed in Stonington CT, a sleepier town than mystic. Which makes sense because mystic was always bustling with tourists. Besides the restaurant mystic pizza(I've never actually eaten there before lol), Mystic was mostly known for the Mystic Aquarium. Pizza really is embedded into the Connecticut culture though. Chain pizza restaurants are filled with employees who are just there for the paycheck. But Connecticut (and the whole northeast) is dotted with so many independent pizzerias. For the owners this is their life and legacy. And for the regular employees often times they are in the family business or have a deep connection to what they're doing. The movie Mystic Pizza really captured this perfectly. I'm very quick to correct someone when they say New York has the best pizza. New Haven is where it's at.

It's very predictable and a movie by numbers, and very typical--however, Lili Taylor, who I almost just called Lily Allen, is pretty good.

He stinks, as does Julia Roberts, but she is even okay in this movie. I would have cast Lori Loughlin as the Julia Roberts role, though. Annabeth Gish has a cool enough name for me to cast her in the movie too.",Mystic Pizza

Update in 2020: still like it and noticed a young Matt Damon as well!",Mystic Pizza
48,asiegel-8,Good Chic Flick,8,18 July 2006,"This movie is definitely for girls and women, men just don't seem to appreciate it as much. This is a comedy-drama, for those 13 and up. The movie starts out with a wedding where the bride, Jo, promptly faints at the alter, and then bursts into the pizza parlor where she and her bridesmaids work in Mystic, CN, apparently a Portuguese immigrant town. We meet the other two waitresses who are sisters, the parlor owner and her husband.There a lot of sub-plots in the movie. One of the sisters, Kat, who is naive and is trying to be a Yale bound astronomer and baby-sits for a local architect while his wife is away trying to make $ for school, the other Daisy (Julia Roberts' character) doesn't know what she wants to do other than be rich and sleep around. Through the beginning and middle the pizza parlor is in financial trouble, the fainting bride's fiancée, Bill, is still trying to marry her, the astronomer, Kat, is getting caught up in a crush and still trying to make money for Yale, and the floozy sister, Daisy, finds a boyfriend with a Porsche, and the pizza parlor owners are trying to help the girls (they see as their own since they don't have kids), through their trials and celebrations. The ending is fitting and realistic, nothing shocking.This is a great movie with the girls or alone with a glass of wine, if you're a first or second generation from an immigrant family now in the US the movie hits home as well.",Mystic Pizza
49,tgjenn,Nice Romantic Comedy,8,7 September 2000,"I first saw this movie when I was 17 and enjoyed it; more than 10 years later I still do.  It does have some predictability to it, particularly in the relationship between Kat and the Yale alumnus.  However, there are also some priceless scenes --- one of my favorites is how Jojo's parents react when they catch her and Bill in a ""compromising"" pose in the dining room. I thought the acting was well done, especially from Julia Roberts and Conchatta Ferrell.",Mystic Pizza
50,yajji,Better than the IMDb rating would suggest,8,26 June 2014,"I have always thought Mystic Pizza was a very good, light hearted film. It's extremely well acted, the script is solid and witty, the cinematography is just heavenly (those Autumn colours are sensational!), and the story itself is heart warning and poignant. There comes a time in every young person's life when they have to figure out which direction they want to head, how they are going to get there and whether or not they will stay in the environment that reared them or branch out, beginning a new life. However, despite the uncertainty that plagues teens and twenty-somethings, there is one universal bond that will seal all cracks and that is friendship, which is the core of Mystic Pizza.This unbreakable duo of friends consists of a then unknown, yet incredibly very striking Julia Roberts. She gives a bright, charismatic performance as the wayward and confused Daisy. Her care free nature is a strong contrast to the level headed, smart and introverted Kat, played by the absolutely gorgeous Annabeth Gish. Last, but certainly not least, is the tempestuous and indecisive Jojo. There's also the men in their lives, the handsome upper-class WASP Charles, who is a little bit of a snob, the unavailable dad Tim (William R. Moses) who has his wandering eyes set on the sensitive, intellectual Kat and Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio), the long suffering husband-to-be of Jojo. The wonderful thing about this film is it never judges its female characters for their promiscuity, nor does it reduce them to crowd-appeasing stereotypes when it depicts their uncertainty or reluctance in picking a ""suitable"" partner, nor does it imply that they really need one. See the resolution of Kat's brief fling with the father of the girl she babysits. They don't run off, living happily ever after, and Kat, clearly changed by the event, doesn't fall into the lap of the next man who shows her attention. Genre clichés are nicely avoided and what's important here, ultimately, is friendship not love or a man. Mystic Pizza is definitely one of the better coming-of-age, small town friendship films, worthy of a lot more than the fairly dismal 6.1/10 rating it currently has.",Mystic Pizza
51,e-jane,"In a word, shallow.",1,7 May 1999,"1) Imagine every woeful teen stereotype that has ever been conceived. 2) Throw in a wide crop of underdeveloped characters and undermine them even more by unremarkable performances by a normally talented bunch. 3) Add a predictable plot, complete with requisite cheesy female-bonding scenes. 4) Remove kitsch hipness that made John Hughes flicks cult classics.And voila!  The recipe for Mystic Pizza.",Mystic Pizza
52,Fanky Malloon,When Julia was human,5,29 June 2002,"I loved seeing Julia with a real size body! Cheers me up tremendously. She's got a real size bum, and a little tummy even. And in those ugly 80s clothes! Sure to cheer you up if you are tired of all the perfect Hollywood bodies.I look forward to watching this movie with my teen daughter.

54,x_filesgurl,Wonderful Movie...,10,28 August 2002,"I absolutely LOVE this movie! I usually hate chick flicks or basically any movie with Julia Roberts, but I still loved this one. Julia Roberts was her same old self, same character she always plays, But Lili Taylor was the best I've ever seen her. And Annabeth gish was my favourite part. She was amazing, though her character wasn't glamorized the way Julia Roberts' was, I found that Annabeth Gish she was far better. This movie was beautiful and I loved it!",Mystic Pizza
55,ashleylynncaissie,A coming of age story with pizza goodness.,3,9 December 2011,"Mystic Pizza A Review by Ashley I was making breakfast when I started watching Mystic Pizza. I can't be completely sure what I made myself that day, but knowing me it was probably a burger or spaghetti of some kind. I had decided to watch T.V. while I made breakfast because cooking can often be very boring, and I needed more stimulation. At first I was just watching the T.V. Guide channel, but I soon found myself switching to AMC to watch the last hour of Mystic Pizza. I have to admit; at first I was completely lost. There were so many conflicts and I spent a lot of time just trying to figure out who the head pizza lady was. She looked so familiar, and it was killing me. Once I settled down and watched the movie a little I really got into it. And although I didn't watch the whole thing I knew everything that had already happened or was going to happen simply by listening. Also I saw that awesome lobster dinner part with young Matt Damon! Pure gold!As I said before, there were a lot of conflicts in the movie. Some of the conflicts in the movie included, but were not limited to: a girl who had family problems, Julia Roberts being poor while her boyfriend was rich, problems paying tuition to Yale/ Harvard, a decline in restaurant profits, and last but not least, dealing with the olds. All I all it was a good movie. I give it seven Golden Apes up! Which is only a 3 on IMDb.",Mystic Pizza
56,grumpy_otter,One of my favorites,10,14 July 2004,"What makes this movie so very charming is the incredible ensemble acting. Watch Vincent D'Onofrio in an early role, as well as Julia Roberts. Annabeth Gish is completely enchanting as Kat, and William R. Moses very believable as the flirting husband. Most wonderful, however, is Lili Taylor as JoJo. Sometimes known as the queen of B movies (I think that was Ebert's title), here she shows the range and talent that indicate she deserves superstardom.Unlike the misleading re-release that features Julia's face prominently, this is NOT a star vehicle, but depends on the interaction of all the players. A wonderful coming-of-age film that has been one of my favorites for 15 years.",Mystic Pizza
57,mark-554-504871,Not a single person has seen this naff film.,1,26 April 2015,"Even Julia Roberts skived off the Premiere by pretending she was ill. This was just as well because if she had turned up she would have found the auditorium empty as everybody else from the cast and crew had also pulled 'sickes'. In a further twist, a lorry carrying twenty-five thousand copies of this terrible film on DVD crashed into the outside wall of Julia Robert's house shortly after release, spilling it's contents onto a main thoroughfare. Not a single copy was taken, either in broad daylight or darkest night and eventually, after about a month or so, the council had to come round and burn them. Julia Robert's own mother didn't bother picking up a copy even though she passed the giant pile hundreds of times walking the dog and the council workers tasked with burning it couldn't even be arsed filching one either.",Mystic Pizza

61,tub83388,Loved it as a kid but now its different,6,16 August 2012,"I remember seeing this movie as a kid and I really loved it then, but seeing it as an adult made me view it with a more detached cynical eye. Don't get me wrong there will always be a part of my heart that loves this film, but the cliché's and cheesy melodrama make it hard to watch now. Its basically a coming of age story about three girls who are experiencing that strange and terrifying transitional period in their lives. They are out of high school but not quite sure what to do now that the world expects something from them. All of a sudden every adult is their peer, and they might bulk under the scrutiny of a small town in which everyone knows every one's business or get out. Also there is the matter of romance: some people are late bloomers and virgins some are engaged to be married. The good things about this film are the beautiful vistas and the stunning locations. It made me want to live in New England. There is also the performances: the cast is stellar, and its fun to see people like Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, and Vincent D'anafrio all beloved stars today ham it up as unknowns. How ever some of the story lines were predictable and it got on my nerves to see Julia Roberts wallow in the - I know I'm not going to be anything dramatic rants yet all the time being stunningly gorgeous and incredibly street smart and there was never any doubt that she would be just fine. Kind hearted and Innocent Kat who is book smart but knows nothing about life or love was believable, but you could see her character arc from a mile away. Vincent D's intended who just wants to have sex but isn't sure about marriage had some funny quips but you just felt her story line was made that way so that the writers could go you see how different this is from normal girl roles? Isn't it interesting? Part of me knows that this movie was made in an era when cheesiness, good looks and youngish beautiful people turning in over the top performances and nothing more was acceptable, and the 12 year old in me will always cherish it but as an adult I don't think so.",Mystic Pizza
62,ajfwilliams,Enjoyable,8,25 July 2006,"A quiet evening so put on this oldie. Enjoyed it, made me shed a tear but also had good laugh. The so-called teenagers looked too old for that age group. The eldest would have to be 19 then slightly younger would be 17 leaving youngest too young for University. But then again Hollywoods 'young' men often appear to be about mid to even early thirties years old. The few swear words spoil it as a family movie but in the current atmosphere swearing is sadly accepted by majority of would be audiences. The scenery is not important to the plot but gave a little taste of coastal life which makes a refreshing change to so many urban based plots. Worth watching by almost any age. Arthur",Mystic Pizza
63,isaalvarez-43996,Completely misrepresents Portuguese culture,1,1 December 2020,"I was shocked by how this film misrepresents Portuguese culture. ""Portuguee"" is not a thing.

64,bethcapps,"Yes, there's a Mystic Pizza and NO, you don't ever see it in the film",9,15 June 2007,"I love this movie. It was filmed my senior year of High School in and around my hometown so naturally it's one of my favorites. What a strange sensation to see the places in which I grew up on that big screen. Anyway, my main point to this posting, even though it's now 20 years later, is that although there IS an actual Mystic Pizza, you don't ever actually see it in this film. The location used for the Pizza Parlor in the film is actually in the Borough of Stonington which is situated on the water, between Mystic and Pawcatuck. Pawcatuck being where the ""at home"" scenes were all filmed. Anyway, being from that area and around the age they were in the movie when it came out, I love this story! And I really like that no one knew who any of the players were back then. It was YEARS before I even realized Steamer was Matt Damon. This movie is loaded with big names and together they really tell a well done, if over done, coming-of-age tale. senior year. My house, my home town, my friend's truck, his dad's boat...all in the movie.

67,lucey1113,My Favorite Movie,10,5 November 2003,"I first saw this movie when it came out in 1988, and I could relate to it then as a college freshman, in the same age range as Kat, Daisy and JoJo.  Fifteen years later, I watch it for the 80s nostalgia as well as for transporting me back to a simpler time in life (although it didn't seem that way then!)  I love all three performances by Gish, Roberts and Taylor, I believe these are quite possibly the best performances they have ever given. Sometimes I wish more was explained about the background of these characters.  Where is the Arujo girl's father?  Is their mother widowed or divorced? How much older is Daisy than Kat? I have read many reviews of this movie that state that it is ""the summer after high school graduation"". Obviously, these reviewers were not paying attention. It is the fall, as is evidenced by the sweaters, jackets, fall decorations, pumpkins, the line by Kat that, ""next week is Thanksgiving"", and if one looks closely during the pool scene there is a sign behind Daisy that says ""Halloween Party October 31"". Although Kat is off to Yale starting in February, Daisy and Jojo are obviously older than Kat and so, for them, it is not the summer (or fall) after high school. While the romance between Tim and Kat seems more shocking to me now than in 1988 (I must be getting old), it nonetheless still seems believable.  The story lines are all very believable, the characters convincing and unaffected. This movie will make you want to be 18 again!",Mystic Pizza

Roberts, Taylor and Gish shine in this film with lovely supporting performances from Conchata Ferrell etc. The film deviates away from the whole 'brat pack' style of 80s coming of age films which is refreshing (no disrespect to Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink etc.) and creates a new perspective of 3 young teenage girls growing up in a small town and having their own inner unique hopes and anxieties for their futures making this film as relevant it is today as it was 30 years ago for young teenagers both female and male alike.",Mystic Pizza
