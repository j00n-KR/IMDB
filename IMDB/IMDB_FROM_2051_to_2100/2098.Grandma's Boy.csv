0,SnoopyStyle,lead lacks charisma,5,23 August 2015,"Alex (Allen Covert) is a middle-aged bachelor video game tester living with his roommate Josh. They're thrown out after Josh waste their rent money on hookers. Alex tries to live with his marijuana dealer Dante but Dante is getting a lion. His co-worker Jeff still lives with his parents and Alex has an unfortunate incident with his mom. Alex is forced to stay with his grandma (Doris Roberts) and her two friends Grace (Shirley Jones) and Bea (Shirley Knight). Samantha (Linda Cardellini) is the new executive brought in to launch the latest game.Allen Covert is not a funny performer. Even if you're inclined towards slacker weed humor, Allen doesn't have the charisma to be the lead. The humor is OK for what it is. It has some funny moments but the laughs are limited (unless you're baked).",Grandma's Boy
1,gavin6942,"Surprisingly Good Film, And Funny, Too",7,3 August 2010,"A middle-aged video game tester is forced to live with his grandmother to make ends meet. He falls for a female video game employee, but he's in conflict with the biggest nerd of all: his boss.I was happy to see Linda Cardellini after my recent run of watching ""Freaks and Geeks"", but she doesn't seem to be the same. Blond and set to be the girlfriend and nothing more in the film, this is quite the step down from her leading role. Nice to see her just the same.I had no idea what this film was about, but didn't expect much. When I found it to be a funny film, with Adam Sandler connected to it (but not appearing in it), I was very pleased. I'm not very interested in drug humor, and there is plenty of that, but there's enough other stuff to make the drug references not completely overwhelming.If you're into comedies like those with Adam Sandler, this is probably a good choice. I found that it had more heart than the ""American Pie"" films or anything with Will Ferrell.",Grandma's Boy
2,lee_eisenberg,"We can now say that the ""Oklahoma!"" woman has played a woman who did you-know-what with Charlie Chaplin.",10,8 September 2006,"In one of the many movies targeted solely at the slacker/stoner crowd, video game designer Alex (Allen Covert) gets kicked out of his apartment and has to movie in with his grandmother (Doris Roberts) and her roommates (Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight). The rest of the movie has poor Alex trying to balance his work life with home life, all the while having trouble keeping it a secret that he lives with grandma. But then, he has to keep his weird boss (Joel Moore) from exploiting him.I would say that the movie's highlight is the party; that whole scene is, in my opinion, the true manifestation of ultra-cool laziness and partying, even if there's one part that made me think ""Uh, that was a little more than I needed to know.So anyway, the whole thing's a wonderful romp. There isn't a dull moment in it. Aside from the aforementioned cast members, Linda Cardellini, Peter Dante, Kevin Nealon, Nick Swardson, Jonah Hill and Kelvin Yu all turn in some great performances (David Spade and Rob Schneider also appear). A real treat.What would those Broadway composers have thought had they known that the woman who would star in the movie versions of ""Oklahoma!"" and ""The Music Man"" would later star in ""Grandma's Boy""?",Grandma's Boy
3,moonspinner55,Chortling smut,3,16 June 2007,"Colorfully prurient comedy has a pot-smoking video game tester in his mid-thirties getting kicked out of his house and going to live with his grandmother and her two elderly roommates. Co-writer and star Allen Covert--who looks like an immoral Mel Gibson--is an appealing comedian with a dryly sarcastic, what-the-hell attitude, and every scene he shares with grandma Doris Roberts (who loves her free cable) plays fast and smooth. Unfortunately, Covert's scenes at the office, working alongside a group of over-aged kids, are full of dumb jokes, bad gags, ridiculous characters and poor cameos, culminating in the kind of wild party sequence which never works. Actually, the movie's biggest fault is that it plays its best cards too soon, and the first hour of the picture gives you everything its got. ** from ****",Grandma's Boy
4,edwagreen,Grandma's Boy- You Can Have Him 1/2*,2,23 May 2009,"Positively ridiculous film.If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in these kinds of films, they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full-time.While the idea that a 35 year old swinger, who works on video games, loses his apartment and his forced to move in with Grandma Roberts and borders Jones and Knight, this is foolishly dealt with. Imagine the 3 bags getting high on stuff that grandson Alex has left in their home and Jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her grandson!The video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film. The assortment of characters that Alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his weed habit along with the others.Terrible best describes this miserable film.",Grandma's Boy
5,Hey_Sweden,"Likable, entertaining comedy.",7,22 September 2012,"Adam Sandler stock company player Allen Covert got boosted to star status with this easygoing stoner comedy that Covert also produced and co-wrote (with Barry Wernick and co-star Nick Swardson). The amiable Covert plays Alex, a 35 year old video game tester who loses his apartment through no fault of his own. He briefly - very briefly - is able to stay with his co-worker & friend Jeff (Swardson), who refers to his parents as his ""roommates"", until an unforeseen incident involving Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, occurs. Soon he's obliged to accept the offer from his grandmother Lilly (Doris Roberts) to come stay with her and her friends, Grace (Shirley Jones) and Bea (Shirley Knight). He comes to enjoy the arrangement, despite a rocky start, and is immediately attracted to Samantha (Linda Cardellini), the hottie supervising the production of the game that he's currently testing. Covert does a fine job with the writing of this appropriately goof ball movie that includes enough wild and random - and raunchy, of course - insanity to make it pleasurable viewing. The bit with the martial artist chimp is particularly funny. The assorted off the wall characters include Peter Dante (another member of the Adam Sandler stock company) as stoner dude Dante, Joel David Moore as weirdo video game prodigy J.P., Kevin Nealon as Alex's New Age boss, and Jonah Hill as another of his co-workers. They're all good at what they do, but it's really the older generation that adds that something special to this thing, as veterans Roberts and Jones are very much up for anything in this outrageous movie; Roberts is endearing as always, but Jones is a revelation as an oversexed show business groupie whose liaisons included ones with Charlie Chaplin and Abbott & Costello. You'll never look at Shirley Partridge quite the same way again! Predictably enough, there are cameo roles for Sandler's old cohorts David Spade and Rob Schneider. Moore's ""robotic"" shtick does wear a little thin, but that's hardly a major quibble. A production of Sandler's Happy Madison company, this does take a bit of time to kick into gear but once it does it remains an acceptable diversion for its duration. Seven out of 10.",Grandma's Boy
6,view_and_review,"Well, Whadya Know",7,18 October 2021,"I didn't expect that. This movie was actually funny in spite of how utterly silly it was. The weed jokes didn't work for me, but surprisingly the adult child in the form of J. P. the game designer (Joel David Moore) had me cracking up. Regularly adding to the laughs was Jeff (Nick Swardson), game tester and best friend to the main character, Alex (Allen Covert).Alex was a 36-year-old video game tester, pothead, dweller in the home of his grandma. To be fair, the grandma situation was temporary as he'd just been hilariously evicted from his house by his landlord Yuri (Rob Schneider). The movie wasn't deep nor did it have a real conflict until the last fifteen minutes, and even that was mild. It is a fun movie with sophmoric humor that will work with some and not with others. For some inexplicable reason I found it gut-busting.",Grandma's Boy
7,anaconda-40658,Grandma Should be ashamed,3,24 April 2015,"Grandma's Boy (2006): Dir: Nicholaus Goossen / Cast: Allen Covert, Linda Cardellini, Peter Dante, Doris Roberts, Joel Moore: Disappointing comedy about the seemingly innocent as video game tester Allen Covert is forced to move in with his grandmother and her two elderly roommates. Simple plot dissolves into bathroom humour including footage of an elderly woman having sex with a young male. Directed by Nicholaus Goossen with characters who are all morons. The guy who dresses like a character from The Matrix is a complete idiot. Covert is unable to elevate this comic travesty above sewer level and for his first starring role, this is not very promising. Linda Cardellini as a new employee overseeing the deadline release of games is a complete fake. Never once does she convincingly sell the performance. She is more or less a romantic prop with no regards to a decent relationship. Peter Dante plays a friend of Covert's who exports exotic animals to protect his drug stash. In his own movie that might have worked to great comic appeal but here it is just a sideshow. Doris Roberts plays grandma who will eventually turn out to be hip and cool playing video games. Joel Moore plays the most idiotic antagonist dreamt up in a screenplay in a while. Technically well made comedy but with too much stupidity for an hour plus time period for anyone (including grandma) to have to sit through. Score: 3 / 10",Grandma's Boy

Did I thrust 4 railroad spikes completely through my head and live to tell the tale? Well, no (but that would've been less painful in hindsight), I saw the new Happy Madison fiasco ""Gradma's Boy"", the WHOLE thing. No, do not weep for me as I'm already dead. These 90 minutes have ranked among my most painful ever. Whether it was the retarded sitcomish storyline of a game testing moving in with his grand mom and her 'wacky' friends, the annoying geek who broke into robotic voice, the lame attempts at ""humor"", the stereotypical nerds, or the hackneyed 'love' development, it matters not. The fact is that my will to live is now gone. Thanks to all involved for making a festering unfunny abortion of a movie. If you loved ""Eight Crazy Nights"", ""Little Nicky"", or ""Larry the Cable Guy's Health Inspector"", you'll love this film (I strongly advise making you people sterile somehow, by the way).

10,zetes,Can only barely count as a movie,3,19 August 2007,"Lame pot-inspired comedy produced by Adam Sandler. The low quality of this flick makes me long for the relatively well made Sandler vehicles of the 1990s. Grandma's Boy just feels like a bunch of potheads gathered together and crapped out half a script that they wrote while giggling through clouds of smoke. Things people find hilarious when high tend to be, if you're lucky, only slightly funny in sobriety. The only element of the movie that's ever even remotely entertaining is the wonderful stand-up comedian Nick Swardson, who was the reason I rented it in the first place. His movie characters are always the same, but he has a great sense of comic timing. In the film, he gets to sleep with Shirley Jones. Poor Shirley Jones. All of her Patridge Family money must be spent, and DVDs of The Music Man must be gathering dust on Best Buy's shelves. The film also co-stars Jonah Hill, who's getting famous right now from his roles in Knocked Up and Superbad, and Doris Roberts, aka Ray Romano's mom on Everybody Loves Raymond. The movie actually stars Allen Covert. All I have to say about him is it must be nice to have rich friends like Adam Sandler.",Grandma's Boy
11,StevePulaski,The irony of Sandler films,7,5 December 2011,"Why is it that the best Adam Sandler films are the ones where he isn't the lead role? He has a producer's credit on Grandma's Boy; a funny, sometimes juvenile comedy with no plot just a lot of characters doing stupid and hilarious things. It provided me with some of the biggest laughs Happy Madison has ever delivered, yet it also has enough of a soul to acknowledge when it has or is about to go too far.I recently watched Strange Wilderness, another Happy Madison film that failed to deliver the laughs I expected even though it occupied a strong and capable cast. Grandma's Boy features typical Adam Sandler regulars like Allen Covert, Peter Dante, Nick Swardson, and more.Something has to be said and praised about Adam Sandler and his crew; they make movies for themselves. They write scripts that appeal to them, and they couldn't care less if you like them or not. Grandma's Boy is a staple on what they find funny. Not everything was, but I will go as far as to saying I laughed harder and longer than any comedy I've recently seen.There isn't a story. Just many characters with heavy backstory on them. Alex (Covert), a thirty-five year old video game tester, has recently been kicked out of his buddy Josh's house after they both neglect to pay the rent. Alex has no other choice but to go live with his grandmother (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond fame) and her two friends (Jones and Knight).On a few sidenotes, he works with his buddy Jeff (played by Nick Swardson, who is surprisingly very funny here) and is trying to develop a new game he has had in the making for several years. He also can't resist the urge to hold house parties that involved monkeys, bongs, and a ridiculously unorthodox amount of marijuana.Excellent cameos are made by Sandler regulars such as Kevin Nealon, Peter Dante, and David Spade, and a very unlikely member from Drake and Josh also steps into frame for a hilarious and unexpected cameo. The cast handles all the material well, and most of the cameos aren't anticipated unless you've seen many Happy Madison films.A great movie this isn't, but a funny comedy this is. It follows the slapstick formula at points, but also develops a great ability to incorporate some raunchy laughs in as well. Grandma's Boy isn't perfect, but it sustains its loose premise and has fun with the characters. Maybe what has been going on in the heads of Happy Madison employees for years hasn't all been just dead ideas.Starring: Allen Covert, Nick Swardson, Doris Roberts, Linda Cardellini, Shirley Jones, Shirley Knight, Joel Moore, Peter Dante, Kevin Nealon, and Jonah Hill. Directed by: Nicholaus Goossen.",Grandma's Boy
12,KineticSeoul,Very underrated comedy,7,1 October 2009,"Watching this movie, was like watching some good Adam Sandler comedy. But beats out all the new stuff he is in now a days with some really funny jokes that are over the top, although it might seem like a Adam Sandler style of humor, this movie takes the cake when it comes to being over the top with jokes. There are already a lot of stoner comedies out there and although this movie does have a bit of that stoner comedy, most of the jokes revolves around comedy for gamers. Gamers will get a lot of laughs out of this movie, even non gamers will probably find themselves chuckling during certain scenes of the movie. Although there are a lot of random stuff thrown in this movie, I could not help but find just about every scene in this movie hysterical, in a good way. Most of the characters just want to have a good time with Alex who is the protagonist of the movie while he stays at his grandma's house, after getting kicked out after his roommate spent all the rent money on Filipino hookers, but also has to deal with some Matrix obsessed game designer who hates Alex with a passion, and tries to ruin his career and steal the girl he fell for. Although it may seem a bit cliché, the way the characters go about it adds a lot of entertainment value, although some may find comedies like this one vulgar those that do enjoy it will have a fun time watching it, although it's not groundbreaking.7.5/10",Grandma's Boy
13,thesar-2,"Oh, Boy! Oh, Boy! Oh, Boy!",9,25 July 2015,"Funny. The two things that have kept me away from this movie for 9 years are: Adam Sandler was involved (produced) and that dang, disgustingly bad movie poster. I still hate both, but no longer will I avoid this movie.Man, this movie deserves repeat viewings. Maybe a little pot, too. Since I've not done either, I will have to look to the future to correct these mistakes. (NOTE: Once pot is legalized in my state, that is. Haha.) But, from a first time viewer, here in 2015, I did laugh my ass off a few times and when I wasn't, I still did appreciate the film, comedy and direction of the movie. While not the most original movie or concept, it just went with it. Felt real. No frauds, no attempting to be anything it's not and no copying anything else out (before, during or following 2006.) It wasn't just original for being its own movie or script, it was refreshing that almost a decade later an R-rated comedy didn't rely on cheap tricks, raunchy humor, dick jokes for 80% of the film or excessiveness. In fact, there was actually some heart and genuineness to the characters without over doing it.Beyond the praises, and I have plenty, this movie was truly funny. So funny, I had to pause it several times from either laughing too hard and long, or to catch all the insane(ly hilarious) one-liners. This movie was great and I honestly regret missing this comedy for so long. I won't make this mistake again.* * *Final thoughts: You will never see ""Starring: Adam Sandler"" on any of my BluRay cases. EVER. But, ""Produced by""? Sure. Already own a guilty pleasure of mine on Blu: Paul Blart: Mall Cop. I'm pretty sure I'll add this one soon enough.",Grandma's Boy
14,cherold,"not just surface bad, bad to the bone",3,17 June 2006,"If a movie has an unimaginative, hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really, really funny. You can get away with a lot if you're funny. But while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in Grandma's Boy, they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance.The movie certainly doesn't aim to surprise anyone. When Alex hides marijuana in his grandma's house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does. The movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them.The most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy. But don't be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. This is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games.The way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of J.P. J.P. is I think more-or-less conspired by the creator of Doom, John Carmack. At least inspired to the extent that he's an odd genius who makes games.In the movie, J.P. is a weird, obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers. That makes no sense at all. If you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as J.P. is supposed to be) then even if you're quirky and obnoxious, people will still admire and respect you on some level. If Stephen Hawking is obnoxious his associates still aren't going to make jun of him to his face.Also, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as J.P., but in the movie they are basically frat boys. It's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie. And while that formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the setting of a game company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you don't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one. Unless you're a hack.About two thirds of the way through the movie I gave up. Something happened that I knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized I hadn't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway. So I stopped (although I did fast forward just to make sure I was right that they would follow the most predictable clichés, which they did).Normally if a movie's bad I just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe.Shame on the movie for luring a good actress like Linda Cardellini into it, then surrounding her with talentless nobodies. I'll give the movie 1 point for giving Shirley Jones the chance to be the anti-Shirley Partridge though.",Grandma's Boy

16,Robert_duder,A raunchy silly comedy that somehow endeared itself to me,8,23 August 2009,"I am the LAST person that would ever bestow unwarranted praise on silly slapstick raunchy comedy and Grandma's Boy looked like exactly that type of film. On top of that the movie is basically the ultimate in stoner comedy and general misuse of drugs for comedy annoys the hell out of me and yet here I am bestowing a decent review on a movie that embodies this kind of lame stoner comedy. I think Grandma's Boy is held together mostly on the charisma of its star Allen Covert who in this film is a dead ringer for Mel Gibson...its crazy!! This is absolutely the type of zany Adam Sandler comedy (his company produces) that you need to check your brain at the door in order to enjoy and I can do that and did indeed do that and found myself laughing at the slapstick and physical comedy. On top of that while the script will never, ever, ever take home any sort of awards for any level of genius writing, the story is actually entertaining and there is a clear cut villain and the heroes of the story are so likable that you are cheering right along with them to beat the villain and come out on top. Add in some great cameos and some really quirky characters and you have a stupid comedy...that is actually not so stupid.As mentioned Allen Covert is great in his role as washed up video game tester Alex. Covert has a ton of charisma in this role and really does hold the movie together. I'm surprised he hasn't become more of a star and less of a supporting actor in Sandler films because he could carry a movie and does well in this. I'm not sure his talent as a comedian would extend outside of a picture like this but there is nothing wrong with that. The lovely Linda Cardellini is the unlikely romantic interest for Alex. Her character is meant to seem like she sticks out like a sore thumb and in that way Cardellini is perfect! As the film progresses she joins the cast and meshes together with them perfectly. Somehow Cardellini and Covert have great chemistry together. Joel Moore is amazing as the completely off the wall video game ""genius"" J.P. He is the perfect villain and his insane personality makes him laughable and a joke and yet still a viable villain. Now add in an insane and hilarious supporting cast including Kevin Nealon as as hilarious zen like boss, Shirley Jones, Shirley Knight, and Doris Roberts. You can't even imagine the shock and awe humor in the three latter women partying after getting high.Director Nicholaus Goosen is definitely new to directing and I'm not sure his style shows though in any way. Grandma's Boy is carried entirely on the shoulders of the cast and they make it all worthwhile. An otherwise lame story about video games and stoner 20-30 somethings is somehow made plausible and entertaining and actually funny. The chemistry between Covert and Cardellini make the romance and the friendship really good. So for those of you who love a silly, ridiculous stoner comedy than Grandma's Boy is perfect. Full of vulgarity, sex, drugs and video games. Definitely not my usual choice but it managed to entertain me. 8/10",Grandma's Boy

18,Floated2,Am I missing something here?,1,28 August 2010,"This movie has seem to have many positive people who enjoyed it. So I wanted to see for myself if Id like it too. I remember when this came out and I thought it looked decent, I figured the cast could pull-off something funny. I just didn't get the chance to see this and time quickly passed. But just a few days ago I managed to watch it, and I found it completely unfunny and pointless. I don't see why people find this funny. I really didn't laugh at any of the stupid gags and ""jokes"" in the movie. The main problem with this movie is that it tried too hard to be funny, and most times when that happens, it ends up being non-funny. The acting wasn't all that great, and the plot was completely non-existent. It started off pretty okay, then towards the middle the plot went away and it was all about the cast just making stuff up (going out for dinner, having a party, getting high). And the ending was beyond awful. Also many of the characters were really annoying. The lead Allen he wasn't that bad but for the others (Samantha, Dante, Jeff, JP, two one of the grandma's) So much of the plot was predictable, and what wasn't predictable was just stupid.

19,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Stoner video game comedy for dorks: Either that's you or it isn't.,2,13 December 2009,"Call me old fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought ""stoner comedy"" was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high. ""Grandma's Boy,"" however, has decided this is a full-blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached. Apparently, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison gang were right, but that doesn't make ""Grandma's Boy"" any less boring and unfunny. They might be completely stoned -- but the characters are mostly half-baked.Alex (Covert, a longtime supporting player for Adam Sandler, first-time star) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted. He could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. After trying a couple friends, he ends up living with good ole Grandma Lilly (Doris Roberts of ""Everybody Loves Raymond""). She wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadline.Like most people, Alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both. His friends/co-workers all do the same thing. Most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games. They're all awkward and all with the exception of Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only at times) their characters aren't funny. Funny if you're blazed ... sure, i suppose, but I can't say from experience.Maybe all we loser guys like is getting high, playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts, but even so, it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film. Neither should old women getting high on accident (saw that one coming) or being the but of gross-out sex jokes -- but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything. No conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot, Alex trying to get the hot girl (Linda Cardellini) to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline.Characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks, but aside from a lovable Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and Joel Moore's skill at making robot noises, there's little character ingenuity. Covert is a run-of-the-mill main character with no comedic dimensions, his dealer friend Dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far into the periphery it doesn't matter.If you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness, ""Grandma's Boy"" will likely be just what you're looking for. Those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected. The most I can say for ""Grandma's Boy"" is that it's watchable despite its pointlessness. It won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half.~Steven CVisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com",Grandma's Boy
20,Fluke_Skywalker,"Amiably stupid, occasionally funny, instantly forgettable",5,1 May 2015,"'Grandma's Boy' has become a bit of a cult film in the decade since it flopped at the box office, and it's easy to see why. With its raunchy frat boy humor and stoner friendly sensibilities, it was destined to find its audience on home video and cable. I certainly appreciate the genial way in which the film lazily goes about its business, but that doesn't make up for just how flimsy it is.Acting more as a vessel for a series of ridiculous gags, 'Grandma's Boy' meanders around for the bulk of its hour and a half running time without any real plot or focus. It's not until the last fifteen minutes or so that any real obstacle or objective is introduced, and even that is quickly solved without our heroes breaking much of a sweat.If you're looking for a dumb and undemanding movie, you could do worse. Not much, perhaps, but worse none the less.",Grandma's Boy
21,jfgibson73,I'm thinking of getting robot legs...,6,16 June 2010,"I really don't want to give this movie credit. I am not a fan of pot humor, and a lot of the jokes just strike me as trying to hard. Yet, when I find it on t.v., I will stop and watch. I don't want to, but I do.It's about a guy who works as a video game tester, but he is a little bit older-looking and has some confidence. This immediately puts a twist on the setup, as we would expect a movie about video games to have a Revenge of The Nerds-style story arc, where the geek learns to overcome his lack of proficiency with women. This is more like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. In that movie, Jack Nicholson looked like the coolest guy around, because he was surrounded by ""feebs."" It's a bit like that. Much of it doesn't work at all, such as the unfunny pot dealer, or the new-age influenced CEO played by Kevin Nealon, who brings the movie to a halt in every scene he shows up (Steve Martin essentially played the same character in Baby Mama--equally unfunny).I've read that the guy who plays the main character is a writing partner with Adam Sandler, so that gives you some more idea to the style of humor. I am sure there are folks out there who will find this to be the funniest comedy they've ever seen. And it does seem to have a sort of cult following, along the lines of Office Space--failed in the theater, took off on t.v. and video. I think this is what I would call a guilty pleasure--I can't stand that I actually enjoy it.",Grandma's Boy
22,fertilecelluloid,"Harmless, stupid, intermittently funny comedy",5,16 February 2006,"Half way through this movie, I stopped and looked at myself, and I asked: What the hell are you doing watching ""Grandma's Boy""? Do you have a mental problem? Maybe. I'm not sure. I'd heard some scuttlebutt that this was one of the year's best comedies, a sleeper, an underrated gem. Well, it's a not a gem, a diamond in the rough, or an unheralded masterpiece, but it is intermittently amusing. There are no clever set-ups. There are just solitary gags. Some work. Most don't. It's harmless stuff, and it was good to see a monkey getting a fare shake, but as I'm not a gamer or a stoner, I felt like a homo hanging out at Heff's mansion. I'd compare some of the more gross sections of ""Grandma's House"" to the gross sections of Tom Green's ""Freddy Gets Fingered"". Shirley Jones from The Partridge Family plays a silver-haired slut (yes, you heard it right) who's banged over 3000 guys and spends half the scenes she's in here swapping spit with a tragic computer nerd. The stand-out performance for me was Joel Moore, a bi-polar gaming genius whose alternative personality is a robot. Moore is pretty damn funny and reminded me of a coked-up Marilyn Manson. Linda Cardellini is a cute, sexy little thing and turns in a sparkly performance as a project manager who motivates a bunch of gamers to tidy up the faults in a game they've slaving over for months. For the most part, the film is totally stupid (and flat as a pre-teen's chest) and you may wonder how anybody in their right mind could greenlight it. I guess the name ""Adam Sandler"" (one of the film's exec producers) had something to do with it. If you like non-stop doper jokes, monkeys, titties (who doesn't?), gross humor and dozens of nerds getting plenty of screen time, give the film a chance.",Grandma's Boy
23,TOMNEL,Maybe Sandler films are better off without Sandler.,6,13 June 2009,"Adam Sandler is known for his crude (usually) PG-13 rated Happy Madison comedies, usually starring him, or occasionally his buddy Rob Schneider. In a rare occasion, we have a Happy Madison production where Sandler's usual back-up players are the leads, and they actually do a decent job, much better than most of the stuff he does. Watching this, it's actually surprising Sandler wasn't in this, as every line Allen Covert says sounds like something Adam Sandler would say, except Covert adds a certain freshness to the role. For a stupid comedy, this really isn't too bad.Alex (Allen Covert) lost his apartment thanks to his roommate, and has been kicked out of bunking with a buddy because of a most disgusting accident, so now he's living with his grandma (Doris Roberts), and her buddies Grace (Shirley Jones) and Bea (Shirley Knight). His profession is a video game tester and creator, and he's also got a sexy new boss, Samantha (Linda Cardenelli). Will Alex be able to woo her while also drinking lots of beer and smoking lots of pot? Will Alex and his buddies get into zany mayhem with the old ladies? The answers are in the picture.Really, this is the typical film Adam Sandler would do, except with more drug use. The dialogue similarly to much of Adam Sandler's films, consists of smart alec quips that grow tiring to hear real quick, but Allen Covert pulls them off much better than Mr. Sandler ever has. So the actors are actually not too bad. Joel Moore is the creepy villain in the movie, and when he gets nervous he talks like a robot. It's very dumb, and gets old pretty quick, but still produces some laughs. Peter Dante plays Alex's drug dealer, and with the amount of screen time he gets, does a fairly memorable and decent job. Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight are elderly women, and know how to play what they are well. Rob Schneider and David Spade show up in throw away cameo roles.The humor comes mainly not from cleverness or jokes, but from the stupidity of the situations. A guy talking like a robot isn't really a joke, but it is very stupid. Old ladies accidentally getting high on marijuana is a dumb situation, but somewhat amusing. A karate chimpanzee...well, that might have crossed the line a bit as it was just plain dumb. All too often this movie pushes the boundary between funny and dumb, an all throughout it's on the fence between the two, but the victor would probably be funny.This is not a perfect film by any means...nor is it a good film. It's fairly entertaining throughout, and has enough inspired stupidity to keep it afloat. Almost every scene has some sort of laugh, but when the movie's throwing a potential ten laughs a scene, and only one hits, that isn't necessarily a good thing.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. R for strong language, drug use and sexuality.",Grandma's Boy
24,raulfaust,Just good,7,17 November 2010,"This movie has an innocent plot about a 35-old dude who lives his life as if he was 20 and nothing to worry about.What I liked in this movie was the fact that his ""roommates"" were 60ish but were different from the most old American women: they laugh, speak bad words, talk about sex and don't bother the audience with that ""God is watching us"". Most American old women that I know are all religious and serious people, like being happy is forbidden. That's what I most liked about this movie.I may have not laughed so much in the whole movie, but it was a cool-seeing piece of entertainment",Grandma's Boy
25,Matt_Layden,"""Less On The Weed And More On The Games Would Make This Film Funny""",5,10 August 2006,"After ""not paying rent"" in his old apartment, 25 year old gamer Alex has to move in with his grandmother and her two lady friends. Free food, smoking weed and playing games sounds like the best thing for Alex, but his grandmother is making him do chores around the house. These chores are making Alex too tired to test any games for glitches, or even finish his own game ""Demonik"".This is a film that is made by the guys that you always see in Sandler's films. Why someone out there thought that they deserved their own film is beyond me, but here we have it and they missed the ball completely. With a concept that would appeal to many ""geeks"" and gamers alike, the film just has no really funny moments to keep the laughter going throughout. Maybe if ""Grandma's Boy"" concentrated less on the weed and more on the games, then this film would be a lot funnier.With Allen Covert in the lead role (you might recognize him as Sandler's roommate in Little Nicky) I had my doubts that he would be able to hold the film on his own. While he does try his best, he gets upstaged by Nick Swardson as Jeff, the race car bed guy. Swardson manages to get most of, if not the only laughs in the entire film, whether it be his Dance Dance Revolution jig or just his tone of voice, he is without a doubt the highlight in the unfunny flick. I see good things for hi in the future for comedy. Not even the random cameo's from SNL alumni can get a laugh, with Rob Schneider, David Spade and Kevin Nealon (in a bizarre role). I'm still sitting here asking myself why is Doris Roberts even in this film.For a film about video games and video game testers, there isn't that many moments of video games in it. Other then the final of the film, that serves no purpose what so ever...come on, the grandma playing the game? Along with one or two other moments the film is really about smoking weed and having a party. If the filmmakers had left out the whole weed part of it and added in more games and more comedy involving games, poking fun at gamers, then I could find myself enjoying it a bit more. This is also one of the few films when I question the point of having nudity in it. Is it to get a laugh with the kid sucking on the breasts?One of the long running gags in the film is that it pokes fun at the ""Matrix Geeks"", with one of it's character dressing up like NEO and acting like a robot, much like Keanue Reeves acting. This character has to be the most annoying part of the entire thing. His constant robot speeches and actions get tiresome after the second time and eye rolling the third and fourth. I wanted to shoot myself every other time he did it.There is no real plot to the film, it's just about a guy who moves in with his grandmother and has to test a game. Near the end, there is somewhat of a plot when the neo character steals the game from Alex and he has to prove that the game is his, but the answer they come up with is ridiculous. Jokes drag on way too long that aren't funny, again the matrix guy, and jokes that do work are way to short, Dance Dance Revolution.I'd recommend that you skip this film as it has no real funny parts that weren't shown in the trailer. You may laugh at the fact that the lead character does in fact look like Mel Gibson. Grandma's Boy is a painful experience that will have you scratching your head as to why you gave it the light of day in the first place.",Grandma's Boy
26,fntstcplnt,Grandma's Boy (2006),6,19 December 2019,"Directed by Nicholaus Goossen. Starring Allen Covert, Linda Cardellini, Nick Swardson, Doris Roberts, Joel Moore, Shirley Jones, Peter Dante, Jonah Hill, Kelvin Yu, Kevin Nealon, Shirley Knight, Jonathan Loughran. (R)Guilty pleasure time: by any reasonable measure, this crude, lowbrow comedy should be a (wasted) waste of time, yet its stupidity frequently amuses and its shoddiness is appropriate, if not actually (gasp) a little endearing. Video game tester Covert gets kicked out by his landlord, shacks up with his grandma (Roberts) and her two elderly gal pals; meanwhile, his attention at work is torn between an arrogant weirdo ""genius"" (Moore) and a cute consultant (Cardellini) brought aboard to get the latest project completed on time. A blend of stoner humor, gaming references, puerile jokes, and bizarre non-sequiturs, it can be lazy and overly crass at times, but those attuned to its vulgar and half-baked slacker vibes should have a good time--it's actually one of the most agreeable comedies that Happy Madison Productions has delivered (and, no, Adam Sandler doesn't even show up for a cameo, though most of his regulars appear at least briefly). To anyone that ever has wanted to see the Partridge family mom play a randy floozie, your ship has come in.64/100",Grandma's Boy
27,BrandtSponseller,You'll love it if you like these kinds of films (like I do),9,9 July 2006,"Well, obviously some viewers didn't like this one, and that's the case with all comedies that we could compare to Grandma's Boy. I still haven't quite gotten a handle on what those viewers aren't seeing in these films that they would like to see. The typical answers are that they want something funny, something not stupid, not clichéd, and so on, but of course that doesn't tell us much, because lots of us do find these movies funny, not stupid and not clichéd.So how do you know whether you'd like Grandma's Boy if you haven't seen it yet? It's worth noting that Adam Sandler it, it features a lot of Sandler regulars, and it's the vein of Adam Sandler comedies like Happy Gilmore (1996), The Waterboy (1998) and Little Nicky (2000). Actors like Rob Schneider, David Spade and Kevin Nealon have cameos or small parts, and it's also not off base to compare Grandma's Boy to the Deuce Bigalow movies (1999 & 2005), or Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003). Chances are that if you like ""those kinds"" of movies, you'll find a lot to appreciate in Grandma's Boy, too, and if you don't like those kinds of movies, you should know (or should have known) to stay away from this one.Of course Grandma's Boy is exaggerated and not realistic and even ridiculous and absurd at times. That's part of this subgenre of comedy, along with an ever-present irreverence and regular jabs of ""crudeness"" that work because at least in theory, they tend to appear when you least expect them. The idea at this point isn't to top the irreverence and crudeness of previous films, because to do that a filmmaker would basically have to resort to doing various illegal things in front of the camera. The name of the game is to give the false impression that maybe you're going to play things straighter this time around, so that the crazy stuff works in context. Director Nicholaus Goossen shows that he understands this well.Grandma's Boy is about game designers, which by extension makes it about geeks and nerds. This may not be how most game designers (or most grandparents and their friends) really are, but this isn't a documentary, it's a very funny comedy, and this is at least about how those of us who aren't in the business imagine or want them to be. That's part of what makes comedy work--it has exaggerated, fantasy elements by way of caricatures/grotesques of (stereo)types that exist at least in popular, contemporary ""mythology"".There are plenty of gags that people who like these sorts of comedies will remember for a very long time. They arrive about once every two or three minutes at least--just enough time to wipe away your laughter tears from the last gag. You can't get a much better recommendation than that. And if you know you don't like these kinds of films, please, do yourself a favor and just avoid this one, too.",Grandma's Boy

29,oneloveall,Half Baked's Boy,5,5 May 2006,"Borrowing a generous amount of thematic elements from some of the most popular contemporary comedies around including half baked, office space, and American pie, Grandma's boy never seems to find it's own voice throughout the derivative plot and performances. To the film's benefit, they do manage to tap into a fairly unique niche market-the video gaming crowd, to deliver some underused stereotypes in their pro-to-geek glory. The main antagonist in particular, while grossly exaggerated, was a pleasure to see come to life on screen, representing the eccentric, antisocial tendencies of the genius video game designer. Sadly the film did not incorporate it's themes of heavy marijuana use as effectively as it's video game theme, somehow making the use of pot feel completely superfluous to the script and somehow thrown in there for blatant appeal to the half-baked set. Being a huge fan of the original weed flicks, it is sad to see Hollywood's ongoing strategy to use pot flicks simply for marketing devices to appeal to younger crowds, while forgetting about the whole content that made the experience in movies like Friday and Half Baked so genuine. All in all, compared to the majority of uninspired laugh out loud comedies that come out lately, you could do a lot worse, provided you are under the age of 25. Grandma's Boy does provide quite a few gut busting moments, just don't expect the replay value to be on par with the great dumb comedies of the past 5, 10 years.",Grandma's Boy
30,DonFishies,Painfully unfunny and boring,1,12 August 2006,"Creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight-rope. It either works, or it does not. Grandma's Boy is one of those movies that does not work. It may have a few very funny parts, but for the majority, it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler films (sans Sandler himself, he's just a producer).Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He's 35, and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kid-filled workplace. He ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just been spending the rent money on Philipino hookers and not paying the landlord). Desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and her two roommates.That's the basic plot of the film, thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as Velma in Scooby Doo) trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as they can, a robot-like game creating prodigy J.P. (Joel Moore) who works with Alex and wears much of the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix, and of course, all sorts of sex and drug related jokes. That's it.The problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it just is not funny. It is totally mind-numbingly boring, and only sparingly funny. Nothing really happens at all. No emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole ton of intense swearing. You find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in complete boredom, wishing you had not even bothered with the film. How this film was greenlit and how Fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me.There's just no entertainment value to come from it. None of the actors are actually putting in good performances, they are just acting like idiots for the camera, and hoping for the best. Stoner comedy has been done before multiple times, and on occasion, actually works (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to mind). Here, it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already. The random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either.Other than a few funny one-liners, this movie should just be out-right missed altogether. It's not very funny, the entire plot is silly, it's boring, and it just makes for one horrendous film. Avoid it like the plague.1.5/10.",Grandma's Boy
31,OriginalMovieBuff21,A very funny stoner comedy,8,29 July 2006,"Grandma's Boy is a very funny movie of 2006 with a great choice of casting. Allen Covert and Peter Dante pretty much stole the show especially with some hilarious lines from Peter, ""dude there was a f***** lion!!"" Most of the cast did really well in pulling off funny lines and I thought for how this was made on a pretty low budget, it did really well. Most of the lines in the film were very funny and about every scene, it was hard not to laugh. Overall, this is an extremely funny stoner comedy of 2006 that I think will get better recognition in the near future. I recommend it and especially for Adam Sandler fans.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",Grandma's Boy
32,Aylmer,"Watchable, yet God-awful",2,6 August 2007,"Strong premise for a comedy movie (a middle-aged video game tester has to move in with his grandma) turns out to be easy to watch and not nearly as revolting or potty-mouthed as comedy films have tended to be in the last few years, BUT is lacking heavily in the laughs department. I sat through the whole thing constantly expecting a ""big laugh"" to come in the next few minutes, and while the film was amusing enough to keep my attention, it failed to deliver. By the time we got to the completely unrealistic party scene where an overweight dweeb gets to suckle a ridiculously inflated breast for hours on end... my patience was at an end. Something was just too staged and formulaic about all of this, too much of a familiarity to the proceedings to really suck me in and surprise me like a good comedy needs to do.Then when I saw Adam Sandler's name in the credits, it all made sense. While he's not in this film, he definitely contributed lots of his sappy one-note humor. Typical of his films, good gags are hinted at but totally mis-handled and then lingered on to the point where they become tired and annoying rather than funny.Also, what's with all the drug use? I'm not against it by any stretch, but this film goes way overboard on presenting marijuana usage as ""the thing to do"". Literally, about half the plot and 60% of the ""jokes"" are centered around smoking pot and all the sweet, awesome stuff that happens to you when you're high. This reflects the humor of a mind (probably Sandler's) that failed to continue maturation after reaching his late teens, most likely a result of early success in comedy television and movies. People who become successful early in life easily lose touch with reality, and in turn, lose understanding of what is funny and what is not (like this film).",Grandma's Boy

Not being able to stay with his friends Dante(Peter Dante)or Jeff (Nick Swardson), he accept an invitation to stay with his Grandma Lily (Doris Roberts)and her 2 roommates Bea (Shirley Knight)and Grace (Shirley Jones).

There's scenes involving pot drinking grannies, a monkey that gets high, does karate and drives (don't ask), and one character has an intimate encounter with a doll. The real funny part involved Shirley Jones. What she does in this movie is 360 degrees from Ms. Partridge from The Partridge Family.To be honest, older people will consider this movie garbage, or won't understand the humor or the video game concept.

The first thought when hearing of this project would be that it would probably have the PG-13 rating attached to it, but surprisingly this movie is Rated R, which really made the movie what it was.

36,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"an original, sweet, and flat out fun stoner comedy",9,15 November 2006,"Grandma's Boy is one of the most original comedies of the year, with 'Borat' beating it out in terms of sheer fun and originality. Most people will recognize the star of the film, Allen Covert, as 'that guy from Adam Sandler's movies'. This marks Covert's first starring role, alongside Linda Cardellini (Scooby Doo, 'ER'), Peter Dante (also a Sandler film veteran), Nick Swardson (Click, The Benchwarmers), Kevin Nealon (Saturday Night Live, Happy Gilmore), Joel David Moore (Dodgeball) and entertainment legends Doris Roberts and Shirley Jones. This excellent ensemble cast puts together a very fun movie that will provide you with hideous jokes, memorable one-liners, and just plain stoner fun. The plot is simple enough. After being kicked out of his apartment in a hysterical scene with another Sandler veteran, Alex (Covert) is forced to move in with his grandmother (Roberts) and her 2 roommates (Shirley's Knight and Jones), and hilarity ensues in ridiculous ways, ranging from animal and marijuana encounters with Dante (Dante...ironic, eh?), sexual tension with his new boss (Cardellini), stupid toilet jokes with his buddies (Swardson, among others), and making fun of his other bosses (Nealon and Moore), especially the just plain weird J.P. (Moore). The standouts are Linda Cardellini, Peter Dante, Nick Swardson, and Allen Covert himself. Cardellini's character is one of the coolest, and she's so cool that any guy wishes that her character was his girlfriend. Peter Dante's character, Dante, is so damn awesome. You'll see. The less you know about him, the better. Nick Swardson's character has some continuity issues but it is understandable if you can really get his character, Jeff. I love Nick Swardson in everything because he always manages to make me laugh (his Click cameo is priceless). Lastly, it's finally great to see Allen Covert holding his own in a movie after so long in the shadow of Adam Sandler, who is a producer of the film (sadly, he doesn't appear, but two of his most famous friends do appear, DB and JD (initials of their most famous characters). All in all, Grandma's Boy is a great comedy with unforgettable moments that will have you talking for a long time.

39,noizyme,"Should've been retitled to ""Let's Smoke Pot and Play Video Games"" IMO",6,3 June 2006,"Grandma's boy was about a 36 year-old guy named Alex (Allen Covert) who is evicted and tries to balance his life with pot, video games, and trying to live with his choice of living with his grandmother and her two friends in her house. He's a video game tester and has a variety of kooky friends who are everything that he needs out of life. When a hot girl comes to work for the company that Alex works for, he spends more and more time trying to date her. He also designed a video game that he hopes will take off in the company, but his plans are slightly foiled by a jealous co-worker who tries desperately to repeat his previous success in the company by stealing Alex's game idea.There was no moral point really to this movie, especially when you see that all Alex does is run to pot when his plans do not go as planned. It's a very modern movie, touching on subjects that happen to a lot of privileged 20-something's throughout their first ten years on their own. This movie really just feels like a showcase for some of Adam Sandler's friends/comedian buddies who have been in almost every one of the older Sandler pictures but hardly get any screen time. So Allen Covert plays a pretty good protagonist in this picture, but you really just get tired of the pot references in about every 5th scene.I loved Nick Swardson as the fellow employee, Jeff. His naive mind in this character plays out like some of Nick's ideas on stage during his stand-up work. I thought another of Sandler's friend, Peter Dante, was a pretty good weed-pusher who always got abstract animals at his place to guard his stuff. But it looks like Peter's probably more known for his body than his comedy, so I got suspect of his ability in other films.The greatest scenes IMO were the DDR match, Aphex Twin playing (loudly) in JD's creative space (but cut out the robot crap, please), Kevin Nealon and David Spade's characters (both as new age philosophers about life and food, respectively), the jokes about Grace (one of the grandma's friends) hooking up with Jeff and the Charlie Chaplin/Abbott and Costello jokes, and the Salt N Pepa karaoke was awesome.All in all, I gave it a 6 from 1-10. Decent comedy about having fun and making the most from a weird situation in life, but I have a feeling this movie was an excuse to throw a raging party and just smoke bud for about 6 months during the shoot. But you should still check out the kid from 40-year-old Virgin smothering himself with some porn star at the house party...some movies just don't have that yet (there's a shocker).",Grandma's Boy

I myself think there is space in this world for brainless, mindless entertainment and actually found Grandmas Boy quite funny. Silly at times yes, sometimes pointless but most of the time I thought it was hilarious.The story is about Alex, a 35 year old game tester that works for a company called Brainasium.

Unfortunately for Alex in the middle of the deadline for this game he is kicked out of his apartment by his landlord and is forced to move in with his Grandmother who lives with two roommates, one is a nymphomaniac and the other is addicted to medications. Craziness ensues when weed is smoked in huge quantities by everyone. And I mean everyone! Even Grandma gets a hit of that bong! This type of film is tailor made for gamers, potheads, virgins and all around geeks. What that says about me since I actually found myself enjoying this piece of silly comedy is left to your own interpretation. OK, OK. Ill admit it. I'm a gamer, not the type that would spend days on end playing a game locked up in his room as the rest of the world continues with their natural active lives, but yeah, I do enjoy playing a good game or two every now and then. But this film itself is dedicated to those hardcore guys and gals that enjoy wasting hours upon hours of their lives playing video games. There's a funny sequence with these two gamers challenging themselves to different old school video games like Frogger and Dance Revolution. So if you're a gamer you will no doubt understand and get all the jokes going on here, everyone else will be like what? Why is that funny? In some circles video games and weed go hand in hand, much like movies and alcohol. So this movie of course has its weed consuming ratio very very high. I mean they smoke more ganja on this movie then on Harold and Kumar go to White Castle! I swear to god, There's a weed related joke every five minutes! Most of the weed related jokes are pretty darn funny like when Alexs grandma accidentally consumes a whole bag of ganja cause she confuses it with a bag of tea. Watching grandma go bonkers while watching Spanish TV was hilarious for me. Also the party that ensues after that lends itself for some funny as heck moments as well.And for the Geek in all of us, there's many many jokes made at the expense of geeks all around the world. There's a guy for instance thats the developer of the video game who thinks he is Neo from the Matrix. He walks around dressed in a black trench coat, black clothes, boots and sun glasses with gel all over his hair. He calls this girl he likes my lady and constantly refers to himself as a genius. He is actually one of the funniest parts of the film. Oh yeah, and he walks around making robot noises as if he himself was a robot! References to video games, movies and cartoon shows like Samurai Jack abound.Most of the actors in this movie you've seen in other films like Adam Sandlers films. But you'll never know their names cause non of them are instantly recognizable. Though for the most part they are funny. Well, maybe you'll recognize Allen Covert (Alex) from Sandlers films (I think he has been in everyone of Sandlers films) but you wont know his name. You wont go OH! There's Allen Covert! But you get my drift. No big stars here, which if you ask me was a good thing. There are a few cameos from Sandlers more famous buddies like for example Rob Schneider appears as a nasty landlord and Kevin Nealon as a new agie boss. David Spade also makes it into the movie as a snotty waiter in a health food restaurant.This movies plot is practically non existent, so don't go in expecting a mind blowing storyline that will reveal the secrets of the universe to you. This is as low brow as you can get. As juvenile as you can get. But its also pretty funny. Not incredibly oh my god I'm gonna bust a gut funny, but giggle every five minutes funny. I was presently surprised with this straight to video flick. I never heard much about its theatrical release, but I'm glad I discovered it on DVD. So if your looking for a night of no brains, silly, juvenile, pot head, gamer entertainment then Grandmas Boy is the ticket for you.Rating: 3 out of 5",Grandma's Boy
41,samseescinema,Grandma's Boy is another emblematic outing for Happy Madison Productions,6,11 January 2006,"Grandma's Boy reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating: 2 out of 4 With one part insulting condescension, two parts stupidity, and a final part unabashed heart, Grandma's Boy is another emblematic outing for Happy Madison Productions. The film orbits around the innately childish life of video game tester, Alex (Allen Covert), and the zany realisms of bunking with Grandma Lilly (Doris Roberts) and her two friends, Grace (Shirley Jones) and Bea (Shirley Knight). It's a tried and true formula: pitting one generation against another and witnessing the expected frenzy unfold. But Grandma's Boy attempts to do this honestly; with supposed truths about the young generation of gamers and the last generation's practical conventions butting heads. But the film rams itself headlong into stereotypes, defining each character with single, disgraceful traits, and misfiring its portrayal of gamers with slighting aloofness.Video Games are an emerging art form. Where film infuses modicums of music, literature, and visual art to form its medium, video games try similarly with human interaction. And although they've, as of yet, failed to find a market outside of flurried violence and badly used language, I believe that eventually video games will heighten into another valid medium of art, with dimensional characters and fully realized story lines for gamers to experience. Grandma's Boy touted itself as the shining knight for these video games, and was marketed as the film to advocate they're presence in this generation's lives. Instead, Grandma's Boy presents its gamer audience with idiots and social misnomers posing as characters. The glazed over, desperately virginal, and socially misfit image of a video gamer is epitomized by this film. Grandma's Boy doesn't do gamers justice, but ignorantly condescends to them, offering only stereotypical characters written solely for the jokes they spew. And without any realistic subtext for these stereotypes, their jokes fall thankfully flat.But for all the nonsensical ignorance the film spouts, its anti-hero, Alex, at least has a heart. It may be buried beneath multiple layers of hash, alcohol, and poorly laid sex jokes, but, unlike the rest of Grandma's Boy's characters, Alex could walk down the street without being forced into an insane asylum. There even lies a semi-heartfelt romance in between the two parts stupidity and one part insulting condescension. Samantha (Linda Cardellini), the development supervisor for Eternal Death Slayer 3, the game Alex is testing, sprouts some sympathy for Alex's embarrassing housing situation with Grandma Lilly. The two go out on a celebratory business dinner, accidentally get Grandma Lilly stoned, and launch a wild, drunken party at her house. The sparks eventually fly and our two uniquely believable characters find each others' lips. The scenes aren't especially inspired, but offer some refreshing solace from the rest of the film's static immaturity.Is Grandma's Boy really all that bad? Well, no. In truth, it has its overtly funny moments, elevating it past other Adam Sandler production duds like The Hot Chick and The Longest Yard. But it doesn't have the strength to rise to the level of the great cinematic job portrayals like Sooper Troopers and Office Space. Grandma's Boy will fall flat with the critics and build a small, unfortunate following with twelve-year-old boys, leaving the rest of the gaming world to wait for its cinematic advocate, and also for the game ruining director Uwe Boll to be murdered in his sleep.reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",Grandma's Boy

Granted, the gaming aspect of it has of course dated itself, but the fun and the humor still holds strong. The odd antics of J.P., the absolute insanity of Dante, and the good nature of Alex's ""roommates"" leave the audience wanting more.I am honestly hoping they consider a sequel to this movie in today's gaming climate. I would love to see J.P. in a VR scenario. This movie definitely isn't family friendly but as a gamer I love it. I will watch again.",Grandma's Boy

He has to choose between staying at his grandmas house with her two friends, one likes medication while the other (lets not get into details), or he could live in the streets. He apparently has no choice but to live in with his grandma. Alex thinks his life is turned upside down but what he didn't know was the comedy that lay ahead of him.Grandmas boy can sometimes be stupid-funny and it can sometimes be a little boring. I hate the scenes with the druggie! The performances from Allen Covert and Jonah Hill are quite good and sometimes a bit awkward, like Jonah sucking a girls breast for 13 hours straight (a ground breaking record), or jerking off on your friends mom.Nevertheless, the movie can be funny as hell which will have your balls laughing out loud. It will be a enjoyable comedy which you will enjoy as much as Harold and Kumar go to white castle, that you won't forget about after a day or two.Haahhahahahahhaha!",Grandma's Boy

They must have really been down on their luck to sign on for this piece of crap. Acting, bad and amateurish, the entire cast needs acting lessons. The script, as funny as a funeral, and seemed to have been written quickly by someone trying to cash in on the American Pie/ Road Trip gross out wave. Former WWF World champion Kevin Nash has the best performance in the film, looking like Alec Guiness, to everyone else, who more or less act stiffer then wooden statue. Good or bad, I've hardly ever walked out on a movie. This is one of those few I walked out of after seeing it at the local dollar theater. Tried watching it again on cable, giving it a second chance, and again, could not sit through the entire flick.There is only one way this movie should ever be shown in it's entirety. That is if the US Government wishes to resort to torture to get information out of someone. A movie so bad, it would have been a shame to put the fictitious Alan Smithee's name on it. I do ask that IMDb does allow us to give movie's a negative score, cause I feel so bad to give this movie a one, cause that's much higher then it deserves.Only watch if you really hate yourself, and which in inflict plain.",Grandma's Boy

If the new 'Death Slayer III' game is not fully tested by the deadline, Alex might be looking for a new place to work as well. Its creator, J.P.

46,powerfull_jedi,To whom exactly is this movie for?,5,15 May 2006,"I had high hopes for this movie, but turned out disappointed. The biggest flaws can be directed at how this film portrays software companies, programmers, testers and gamers in general. Also the distinctive lack of plot doesn't help the movie. The «story» about a 35-year old game tester who gets evicted and has to share a room with his grandma seems fun, but the jokes are very scattered and some knowledge of computer gaming is necessary to get some of the jokes. But it's both interesting and weird to see software companies run by drug addicts, programmers with multiple personality, game testers who act like 8-year old and are pretty much fat-sos and desperate virgins and a software company that looks like a giant amusement park.How exactly did the writers base this off actual game companies is beyond me. It's both interesting and weird because it feels they are mocking the same target audience who wants to see the movie. Still, some jokes are gut-busting, cameos for Saturday Night Live pros are always welcome and Linda Cardelinni shakes off the nerdy look from Scoody Doo into a role where she looks pretty good. But everything else just fails. They must have though: ""Hey, let's make an American Pie for gamers and have them being portrayed as idiots"". Now they wonder: ""Why did it flop!?"" ***sarcasm***",Grandma's Boy

On the other hand, if you don't care whether a movie has a plot, as long as it's funny, Grandma's Boy will definitely satisfy. With plenty of stupid and silly moments (the Lara Croft scene is hilarious) and one-liners, most fans of ""stupid humor"" will enjoy themselves. If you're an uptight, stick-up-the-butt type, you will likely curse the day you saw it. Stay home and eat Cheetos if you take dumb comedies that seriously.No, it's not perfect.

48,michellelocke007,the mother of all stoner movies and hilarious at that. *spoilers*,5,28 October 2010,"bought this movie straight after viewing this one on a late night cable network over the weekend. i wasn't expecting too much out of this one but was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it. i immediately recognized Shirley Jones from the partridge family and the actress who portrays Raymond's mother on everybody loves Raymond. i thought the scene where the three women are watching all the different network programs ie. food network, antiques roadshow afer they had drunk tea made from the marijuana leaves were great. it's nice to see actresses at their age being open minded and having fun with the movie's subject matter of pot-smoking, masturbation, sex and video gaming. but i thought that Shirley Jones icky induced romance with nick swarsdon took the cake. they stole all the scenes that they were in together. snl alumnus David spade and rob Schneider made cameo appearances as well. loved David spade as the slightly effeminate and sarcastic waiter at the organic vegetarian restaurant where the main characters go for a celebratory dinner. so many funny lines. Joel Moore's character of JP kicks ass as well. he's just creepy and strange enough to keep you tuned to the television and wonder what is going to happen next. i kind of felt sorry for him as he really tries to fit in and be one of the regular guys at the gaming centre where the crew all work that is until he stole someone else's idea for a video game...but he gets his in the end. too many funny scenes to mention but the one i like is the dance-off competition between nick swarsden's character and another co-worker. one of those Japanese computerized dance-offs where they match the dance moves on the screen to the one on a giant dance pad. just a light comedy for those looking for laughs.",Grandma's Boy

There are laughs throughout the entire film. Most of them are juvenile, toilet, and stoner jokes but they work for the most part. The film is loaded with toilet humor on the same level as the American Pie films. There is also a sweetness to it that helps balance things out.The film does begin to fall apart towards the end and a some of the writing is pretty predictable.

The only reason why this doesn't fall completely flat on its face, is that those of us who know a little about game development, the game industry and the truly weird characters that spend there life in that kind of environment can actually glimpse some funny bits here and there. However the amount of stupidity and really poor jokes is breathtaking and so we are still waiting for a new GOOD movie about video games - the ones we have so far are OLD (Tron, War Games) don't even mention movies BASED on video games, which so far has proved to be even more awful than this one...

51,anthonymichaelbangert,Stoner Comedy Fun,6,4 December 2014,"This is a strange and interesting stoner comedy. The plot doesn't really have a clear conflict, it just kind of tells a story. A 35 year old video game tester (the best in his company) is evicted from his home when his roommate doesn't pay the rent because he would rather pay for Philippino hookers. He is forced to move in with his grandmother and her two crazy old roommates. He introduces the women to the wonders of cable television, weed, and video games, one of which he is developing himself. At work, he boasts about his, ""crazy sexy roommates"" as the reason he comes into work tired all the time. At his job, he is supposed to be playing a new game behind schedule due to many bugs in the system and reporting on them. A new girl is brought on to the project to make sure it releases by its proposed deadline. The game's creator (a weird, awkward man who thinks he is a robot) wants to date the girl, as well as the main character. A battle ensues, that can not be discussed without giving away the ending. I know, this plot is all over the place, but like I said, there is no conflict. Therefore the whole story just kind of...happens. This is a movie made by stoners (Adam Sandler's crazy group of friends) for stoners. It is definitely funny, and worth watching for the laughs, but it isn't exactly good. Plot holes in this movie are gigantic. The acting is questionable. The music is decent. The cinematography is variable depending on the scene.

Most of the movie is pretty boring, even if you're watching it high. However, it has its moments, it's pretty funny at times and most of the cast is solid. The plot isn't anything crazy either even tho it is a little bit original and it might've had potential if they focused on it more.Grandma's Boy is a decent at best, comedy.

58,the-jerk,Movie most likely to become a cult hit this year.,9,20 June 2006,"The reviews for this movie were so awful (and the buzz so dead) that I really didn't want to see it. I think there was a real bias toward it to begin with because its brainchild is Allen Covert, a frequent collaborator of Adam Sandler's who's rarely attached to anything else, and it was made by Happy Madison, Sandler's production company. And it probably didn't help that the director, Nicholaus Goossen, had only ever directed one movie (and it shows, but so what?).The thing is, an intelligent critic, no matter how fair he thinks he is, is going to be thinking about these kinds of things when he goes to review a movie. And it is probably also true that most of them would have given it a bad review anyway, since most critics are not the fans of Adam Sandler that I am.But now that the movie has been released on DVD it is showing signs of life. I had heard from several people before I actually saw it how funny this movie is and how worth watching it is. And as it turns out, they were right. I was surprised by how funny I thought it was. Covert is no genius but he knows how to milk a situation for laughs; as it happens, he makes a terrific straight man to all of the silliness going on around him (not that his character Alex is particularly normal; an incident happens early on that's so out-there and humiliating that you can't help but laugh).It's a threadbare plot, like many of the best genuine comedies. Alex is thrown out of his house because his loser roommate hasn't paid the rent in 6 months. So after bouncing around here and there he settles into his grandmother's house. Grandma is played by Doris Roberts, and she is very funny in this. She lives with two roommates: Grace, a sex addict going back to the silent film era who repeatedly makes cracks about Alex being gay and ends up sleeping with one of the younger characters, and Bea, played by Shirley Knight, whose mind is pretty absent and who takes way too many drugs (of the legal, pharmaceutical variety).Alex is also a video game tester, and when a woman comes in as his boss (Linda Cardellini), he falls for her. Many of the funniest scenes involve his loser friends and co-workers, most of whom are virgins and/or hopeless drug addicts (of the illegal, THC-based variety). Best of the bunch: Nick Swardson, who is poised to become a real star. I love him as Terry on Reno 911. His character Jeff still lives with his parents (whom he hilariously refers to as his ""roommates"") and sleeps in a car-shaped bed. And he's a killer at Dance Dance Revolution. Swardson also co-wrote the movie, which may go a bit of the way toward explaining why he steals so many scenes. But he's the funniest part of the movie.Of course, the veterans who play the old ladies are great too. Best is Shirley Jones, who has many of the best lines. But seeing Doris Roberts become an immediate video game zombie, or Shirley Knight arrange her pills like a happy face on her dinner plate, are priceless. If it hadn't been for these women, the movie just wouldn't have been nearly as good, period.Joel Moore (also in ""Dodgeball"") is actually kind of frightening as JP. Frightening, because as weird as JP is, he may also be the least exaggerated of the video game freaks that populate this movie; I've actually known people very much like him. Believe it or not. It's pretty funny on the whole, but the schtick does start to wear a bit thin by the end.There's much to criticize about this movie. A lot of jokes fall flat, and the direction is stiff. But so was the direction in ""Clerks"", and that's looked on as a comedy classic now. And so much of the humor centers around crude sex and drug references (one of the funniest scenes has the old ladies unwittingly drinking pot tea) that you really should steer clear if you don't like risqué humor. But I really think that this has the potential to become another ""Office Space"" (as in, a movie that finds huge success on DVD even though it bombed in theaters) because people seem to love it that much. Yes, it's far from a CINEMA classic. But it has great potential as a cult classic. And on the whole it's a very funny movie, and that's what really matters, in my opinion.",Grandma's Boy
59,craigman,Wasn't nearly as funny as the previews make it seem...,5,11 May 2006,"I just saw this last night with my wife, so its fresh in my mind. First off, I'm surprised it came to DVD so fast! It must have flopped. There were a lot of small elements that I thought were going to be funny, but just fell flat. The whole ""karate monkey"" part was stupid. A lot of the characters were annoying. I grew up playing video games and have a real love of them, but the whole video game theme seemed like an afterthought, and wasn't really explored well. It seems there was a lot of funny material to work with, but it never really came together well. It reminded me a lot of SNL skits that go on WAY TOO LONG. My wife and I both noticed that the movie dragged a lot, and seemed longer than its actual running time. Also, I'm no drug prude, but the rampant pot smoking seemed really excessive. Everybody like to smoke pot! Pot smoking, in itself, is not very funny to watch. It is handled in a funnier way on ""That 70's Show"". Also, they make the ""bad"" character obsessed with ""The Matrix"" and robots and techno music. I like all of those things, and they spoil it! In one scene, the bad nerd is listening to ""Window Licker"" by Aphex Twin, a great song, and they show it in a bad light by having a stupid Asian guy getting annoyed by it. He even goes as far as saying, ""I hate techno music."" The main guy, who looks a lot like Mel Gibson, is okay. I also like the goofy guy with the car for a bed. Most of the other male characters are just stupid and annoying. The young female, who played Velma in the Scooby Doo movies, is hot and does a good job. The older women were okay. Probably the funniest part in the movie is when the guy's grandmother makes him vacuum, and when he lifts the couch, there is a dead cat with a terrified expression. That part, to me and my wife, was hilarious! Also, no one is ever shown actually programming the game! The supposed genius is surrounded by monitors, but never seems to do any work. The good guy has a ""side project"", a game he's been developing for years, yet he only has it on one disc, no copies, and no computer with all of the files! He lets the bad guy borrow the only disk?!? That's retarded! I do a lot of work on computer, and everything is routinely backed up! He should have dozens if copies of such an important project, not to mention all of the files on his computer! The party scene was stupid as well. All of the sudden there were all of these bikers and Hollywood porn star looking women at the grandmas house!

61,brendan-268,Don't waste your time - a bad film executed badly,1,8 February 2013,"Absolute rubbish. I'm really not sure how it has managed to garner such a high rating on IMDb (maybe pot smokers are getting discounts from their dealers if they log on to IMDb and give this movie a high rating?) Basically this is a film about stoners, for stoners that was written by stoners.It's just a series of jokes about pot and sex all thrown together in one 90 minute montage, and it's not even technically proficient.There are lots of scenes that do absolutely nothing to advance the plot. There is ZERO character arc for the lead protagonist. There is almost no plot development (which makes for a completely flat and boring film) apart from the initial set up, and then a brief flurry at the very end which is meant to inject drama into the story. However this final attempt to salvage the plot from being a complete flat-line is so poorly executed, credulous and quickly resolved that it simply may as well not even be there. Even the way this film has been shot and edited together is confusing (at one point, because of the way the actor has been directed and the scene has been shot, the impression is given that the female lead may have something to hide - but no, there is no secret, just poor direction, shooting and editing.) Even the supposed love story in this film is nonsensical - the character of the female lead is simply not developed in any substantial way, and so we don't care about her because we just don't know her. She is literally there to play a formulaic part so that the male lead ends up with a girl at the end.It's just a really bad movie that has been poorly crafted, and which introduces several different themes but never really develops any one of them properly into a cohesive storyline or character arc - it literally starts us off a journey, and then gets lost in pothead woods.(This is probably the harshest review I've ever written on IMDb yet, by the way).",Grandma's Boy
62,bubbathom,The funniest movie I've ever seen,10,8 July 2008,"First off, Grandma's Boy is a movie where there's a ton of crude humor, language, and sexual themes. So, if you don't like comedies like Superbad you probably won't like this one. The plot isn't too bad for this type of a movie. It is kind of corny, but the hilariousness makes up for that. The actors are great. My favorite would have to be Nick Swardson playing Jeff, he does a great job and is hilarious. Allen Covert does very good as a lead character in Alex, and Peter Dante does, in my opinion, one of his funniest movies. This movie had me laughing extremely hard almost the whole time. Overall, my favorite comedy movie of all time. Extremely funny, 10/10.",Grandma's Boy

Film are not the top one, but story is nice and cute.This isn't film for young people, jokes are for 20-40 years old.I will not add Grandma's Boy to the my video collection, but the ""wake-up call"" function of this film, something as ""wake up, don't play games, take some chick, make kids"" is simply priceless :).Similar film is, ""40 year old virgin"". It's about ""same"" situation (guy without any human relationships), take it too.",Grandma's Boy
64,RDenial,Possibly one of the worst movies I ever saw,1,1 August 2006,"If you are a horny 13 year old whose hobby is downloading porn, then you will probably like this film. The humor is about as unsophisticated as it comes. They tried hard to make this one into an American Pie or Something about Mary, but someone forgot to tell the filmmaker that gross does not necessarily equal funny. That seems to be the current trend in Hollywood these days. Among the atrocities that we have to endure in this film is several scenes with some fat ugly guy's mouth attached to a woman's breast. I think this was the same fat ugly guy who wanted to buy the platform shoes in the ebay store in ""the 40 year old virgin"". This must have been a friend of the director who was given this role so he could actually get his mouth on a breast as it probably never happened in real life. Whatever the reason, it never elicits a laugh and seems pointless. Then there is Shirley Jones, now a senior citizen, who is constantly talking about all the old Hollywood stars that she had relations with. Again, it seems like the director must have been a fan of the Partridge Family when he was a kid and had some fantasy of hearing Shirley Jones talking foul. Maybe it is humorous to the 13 year old I mentioned in my opening line, but it wasn't to me. There was one or two mildly amusing lines in this film, but that is not enough to come anywhere near recommending this garbage. The filmmaker needs to go out and rent a copy of ""Duck Soup"" and see what real comedy is all about.",Grandma's Boy
65,HagenSteele,"Sad, pathetic, and the complete opposite of funny.",1,6 September 2012,"Where to begin....A few associates I know treat this film as if it is some kind of ""cult classic"", which I mistakenly assumed meant ""good"".WRONG.I figured as much given the premise, as follows: ""A 35 year old video game tester has to move in with his grandma and her two old lady roommates."" There isn't a lot of humor to be found in this premise.SADNESS? Yes.Comedy? Not so much.How bad could it be? Bad. REAL bad.Despite the cast doing the best they can with what they had (little to nothing), I find it exceedingly difficult to believe that anybody above the age of 12 could do anything but feel insulted by the ridiculous way the characters are portrayed, and the utter stupidity of the ""plot"".This is another ""man-child"" film that attempts to capitalize on the ""slacker"" trend Hollywood is so fond of, however, it is completely devoid of humor, as I found all the gags to be PATHETIC instead of funny.A grown man living with his parents and sleeping in a ""race car"" kids bed? Am I supposed to laugh at that? That's not funny. That is sad, pathetic, and the complete opposite of funny, which sums up the film nicely IMO.I stopped watching after about 30 minutes, and highly recommend NOT wasting your time on this one.",Grandma's Boy
66,knightkp,Don't judge me monkey!,8,20 March 2020,"Very well done comedy, has the right people playing the right parts, probably Kevin Nealon's only funny roll. Doris Roberts and Shirley Jones were great. Several of Adam Sandler's regulars are present, and they did well in there rolls, they did not seem forced or as if they were trying harder than they had. Their repertoire seems legit and natural. Very funny and well worth watching for a light comedy.",Grandma's Boy
67,pmakauloski2312,"Not amazing but simple, effective comedy",8,30 July 2015,"The movie is about a 35 year old stoner, Alex (Allen Covert) who works as a video game tester/designer. I'm not a huge fan of Covert as an actor but he plays a decent stoner. After getting kicked out of his apartment by his landlord he moves into his grandmother's house. His grandma lives with two friends of similar age. The older women he lives with are played by Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones, and Shirley Knight. What makes this movie effective in my opinion are the characters. JP, who is a co-worker of Alex, is a weirdo who wears a cape and talks like a robot at times. Jeff, played by Nick Swardson, is Alex's friend and co-worker. Swardson was funny in this film, he even hooks up with one of the older women. Dante, who is Alex's pot dealer was perfect for his role. Linda Cardellini, the girl from ""Freaks and Geeks"" plays the hot new production manager Samantha, sent by corporate. Alex and JP compete for her. Spoiler alert: Alex wins. JP, who is desperate, borrows Alex's only copy of his new video game that he designed and instead shows it to their boss saying that he created it himself. Alex's grandma, who enjoys playing the game, is able to prove that JP didn't actually make the game. Kevin Nealon and Jonah Hill also make appearances.7.5/10 Very funny. It isn't quite at the level of Superbad or the Hangover but it's still a solid comedy that is always enjoyable to watch whenever i see it. All the characters are great and the writing is good.",Grandma's Boy

Seriously, the white characters say ""bro"" so much in, and they're teens. It's portrayed as modern language. No, you idiots. ""Bro"" is not white, or black slang. Folks, who have a brain, if you want a movie with a lot of ""bro"" usage, check out ""The Bronx War"" -- Puerto Rican characters using it, or ""Street War: In the Line of Duty,"" in which an Italian Hispanic character uses it. Those are realistic movies, cause Hispanics and Italians use the word a lot. Even ""JERSEY SHORE"" is more realistic than this trash. Folks, avoid this one at all costs. It's stupid and the story lines are unrealistic too.",Grandma's Boy

Not much different from the usual living at home with the parents and the quality of the movie showed that, just the typical old lady jokes.I don't recommend this one unless you're a very big fan of stoner/loser movies.",Grandma's Boy
71,DiSTuRBeDx,Every Adam Sandler film is better,6,17 June 2012,"Meh. It wasn't the best of comedies out there. It had its moments, very few I might add, but still had them none the less and they were funny. They just weren't consistent or funny enough to make me love this movie. I can not believe it got 6.9 and every Adam Sandler film got less than this.You can defiantly tell that this is a Happy Madison production because in the first 10-15 minutes, most of Sandler's regulars show up - Rob Schneider, Nick Swardson, Buck who's here to f*ck (KILL BILL) and Allen Covert who plays the main man in this. Also, David Spade comes into this down along the line.Allen Covert isn't very good at acting and you can tell in this. He doesn't do a great job and some of the jokes he delivers aren't what they could've been. The storyline was good but the script didn't utilize it. They could've done so much better with this with that cast and plus their was Jonah Hill, who is just a legend.Overall, far from what it could've been. Provided funny moments, but too few and not very consistent. And also, bad acting from Allen Covert with kind of threw me off this a bit. He should just stick to being the regular of Sandler.",Grandma's Boy

IF you like the 49ers and hometown buffet than this is probably not for you. But if you like to win Southern Smokehouse than this is the movie for you. A lot of the scenes are very funny and worth seeing. The ending was abrupt and the beginning very quick. As soon as the movie starts you propelled into the movie. Within the first five minutes you will start to laugh. I warn you that this movie has no plot, however, this will show you that movies do not need plots to be good. After seeing this movie I actually thought about being a video game tester for the rest of my life because you see how fun it is. This movie does not have any famous actors but the actors in this movie are good comedians. In conclusion, if you want to see a good movie see this, but if you want to see a bad one go watch something like The Man or something that fails at comedy.",Grandma's Boy

The movie journeys around their workplace and Alex's desire to create his own video game, which is stolen and has to be proved his own.This is Allen Covert's first lead role and he nails it. He is so believable as a funny, easygoing, stoner type (probably because he actually is one).This is definitely a raunchy comedy with plenty of sexual humor and crude jokes, which is why i think this movie is so funny.

And as sad as it may be I know someone who rather reminds me of JP. I give it a 7 out of 10 only because while it is a great movie, I wouldn't say it's something you can watch over and over again without getting tired of. After seeing this movie once or twice it gets a little old, but it's still very good nonetheless. Just refrain from repeatedly watching it so as not to get tired of it. What's more I was a little shocked to find that the same actress portraying Samantha was also Velma Dinkley in Scooby Doo.

78,LRonCupboard,How long must my people suffer?,3,6 February 2010,"There's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy, don't take it seriously. Chillax dude!!! Well that's one point of view. The other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script, the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these ""comedies"".What you get is a slacker who, through some totally unreal circumstances, has to change his life (always a he), overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager, beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money/self-esteem. On the way somebody does something gross but very illogical. This means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like ""you won't believe it maaann. This guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies. Then he shines his shoes with it"". Hilarious.Most of the usual names turn up. David Spade and Rob Schneider do unfunny shtick but they're crrrazzeee characters - a Russian and, I'm holding my sides, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler, the king of the brainless unfunny, illogical comedy co-produces and some talentless nobody called Dante shows up, yet again. The US will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy Dante is famous for cos we are clueless. Allen Covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me. He was 42 and looked years older.Did I laugh? Yes, but no more than I would at a TV sit-com and I don't have to pay a penny to watch them. Please stop making these movies.",Grandma's Boy

However, if you have a sense of humor or can appreciate comedy movies that are not supposed to be sophisticated crafted Hollywood artistic masterpieces and just everyday people humor you'll like it. If you are a Sandler fan then this movie will fit right in to your catalogue and most likely become a favorite. Its senseless, raunchy, immature, stoner, and gamer comedy meant to be just fun.

I came across Grandma's Boy, which they were only carrying three copies. I had been extremely disappointed in Sandler's most recent funny movies, but something in my gut wanted to give it a shot.So I picked up a copy, and with little expectations, headed home and popped it in to my DVD player. Was I ever surprised!! This movie is hysterical! Just thinking of it has got me laughing. The script is not the greatest, but it is different and has a lot of funny scenes.If you're looking for a good laugh, make sure you pick it up. I guarantee you'll be laughing for quite some time.",Grandma's Boy
82,Justin-Kamal,Pointless yet mildly funny,3,15 January 2006,"I went to see Grandma's boy with a few friends and I must say that it was a waste of time. The movie had basically no story or theme and was not something I would want to see in theaters. I must admit that there were a few laughs here and there but overall, it's just pointless. Nerds may relate to the life experienced by the cast but any movie critic would give this a very low rating.Being an aspiring film-maker, I noticed hundreds of directing mistakes especially relating to scene transition and layout. This is what you'd expect when you let any film school graduate go ahead and direct a feature film. It would have been much better if this movie was released directly to DVD and skipped the theater stage as many other small movies did.All I can say is that if you're not the type to care about technical effects or complex themes, and you'd much rather enjoy mild nudity, toilet humor, and a ""Napoleon Dynamite"" atmosphere, go watch this movie.",Grandma's Boy
83,oneblip,Almost gets gaming right,7,20 January 2006,"Grandma's boy is about a 30 something video game tester named Alex, who is thrown out of his apartment because his lowly room mate decided to spend his rent money on hookers instead. When Alex is thrown out, hilarity ensues as he struggles to find shelter from one place to another, finally settling at his grandmother's house.It finally seems Hollywood has decided to give gamers a good rap instead of the normal lashing. And although they have tried really hard this time around there are still some misconceptions I think this movie will give people about gamers in general. For one thing, not every gamer is a huge pothead. And that is some thing that it seems this movie would have the average person believe. But there are other things it gets right about gaming culture.Scenes where gamers are highly competitive and challenge each other come to mind. Someone also needs to make film makers aware that it's really lame to portray how games are played as flailing your arms every which way, pressing every button you can until the other guy is dead. And it certainly doesn't sound that way either, as the movie would have you believe.Controllers are relatively silent in real life. I understand it might be boring to see two guys just sitting in a chair playing a game, but is it any better watching them look like they aren't actually playing the game? They still could have a conversation that is as humorous as they actually do and still look like they are actually playing the game. With any Sandler and company film there is a lot of potty and sexual humor, but that's okay if that's your bag.The way game testing is portrayed is also a little off. I don't expect it to be accurate, it's a movie. But they could do their research and at least make it sound un-lame and a little accurate. I mean ""I gotta get my levels done"" hardly sounds like something a game tester would say, but I doubt the American public is ready for something a real game tester would say.To give away any of the reasons I really liked this movie would be to ruin it to begin with. Suffice it to say if you are looking to be entertained and like some good pothead/gamer humor, you'll love this movie. Stay away if you are one of those guys who sits in the theater nitpicking set locations.Grandma's Boy gets a 7/10 because it never fails to entertain, it'd probably be a perfect 10 if being a gamer wasn't so misinterpreted.",Grandma's Boy

85,nincompoopian,Nasty and mean-spirited,4,6 March 2021,"In Grandma's Boy, there's an ugly scene in which a group of co-workers are treated to dinner at a vegan restaurant by their yogi boss. The waiter (played by David Spade), though eccentric, seems to be a nice guy, but the boys for some reason start making fun of him, equating his name (""Shilo"") with being a weirdo and a homosexual. When the waiter finally snaps at them, Covert responds passive aggressively, ""Aww, someone missed their yoga class this morning"".I keep thinking, what did Shilo do to deserve the boys' jeer? If the word ""schadenfreude"" were to take the form of a movie, it will be in the form of Grandma's Boy. This is a comedy movie that is so nasty and mean that its lead characters (and the people who jeered along with these people) could be bullies. The characters are content to BSing one another (or other people) and want us to laugh with them. Maybe they want us to like them. In any case, it's so hard to laugh at a comedy when there's no wit and subtlety involved in achieving it.I've seen comedies that are nasty and mean-spirited but still left me howling with laughter and sympathy for its character. One such example is the cop comedy Observe and Report, in which Seth Rogen plays a pill-popping bipolar mall cop who is immature and terrible at his job, but is marked with integrity, grit and determination and we want him to level up from mediocrity and win that nice girl. In Grandma's Boy, the boys are immature from beginning to end, partaking in gross-out laughs that's more gross and less funny, yet the braindead script demands that the everyman still win the sexy boss.Stoner comedies should be fun even when you're not high. Grandma's Boy is only fun when you're high and when not, not. There are better movies in this genre, like ""Friday"" and ""Pineapple Express"", which also stars Seth Rogen.",Grandma's Boy

Grandma's Boy sucked me in with the still frame depicting a chimp, so I was hooked and in for the duration. Unfortunately, the bit with the chimp was a brief cameo at the end, and I paid the price in suffering through the balance of the film first.Billed as a ""cult classic"" on Hulu, I can only wonder what cult would willing to inflict this stinker on their members more than once. Full of coarse language, sex jokes, and non stop stoner humor, Grandma's Boy is hardly the laugh every three minutes some think it is. The scripting is predictable, the acting strained, and the characterizations unbelievable.The premise has promise with two divergent generations under the same roof, but it's wasted with overt attempts at humor that you can see coming a mile away. Nothing subtle here, unfortunately.The only bright spots for me were David Spade's cameo as a waiter in a vegan restaurant, and Shirley Jones as a horribly miscast over-the-hill cougar. I could believe their performances, even when surrounded by the poor performances of their accomplices.There are plenty of true comedic cult classics to enjoy, such as Blazing Saddles, Airplane!, Young Frankenstein, Where's Poppa?, Ghost Town, etc., but Grandma's Boy ain't one of them.",Grandma's Boy

I laughed from beginning to end. The greatest part of the film is that all of the actors play their very strange comedic roles as if the characters were real people, and they put a lot of heart into their performances. That lifts up the film from being a cheap slapstick comedy to something much better, something to treasure from beginning to end.The film evolves around a computer game company that is trying to finish a computer game. The employees are the strangest cast of characters you can muster in a film. The main character in the film has to live with his grandmother, since he got evicted from his apartment. The cast of characters from the computer games company and the grandma and her roommates intertwine in hilarious ways in the film, and in the process breach taboos.All in all, a wonderful night out.

This has got to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. All the acting and jokes are right on point. Even the story line makes some sense! The entire group of actors make this a great movie. ""TJ the robot freak is awesome"" and The ""dealer"" bring in all the animals is just great! I must admit, this is one DVD you need to buy. I have watched it almost 10 or 12 times and laugh my ass off on each occasion. GET THIS DVD!!!! Im surprise the ranking is not at least a 7.5 or higher! GREAT MOVIE!",Grandma's Boy

My oldest son loves video games and his grandmother in equal measures and both of them wanted to see the movie together. Needless to say, if you've seen this movie, you didn't want to see it with your mother or your eight year old son. I loved the movie and thought it had some very funny scenes in it. This was a pleasant surprise as I thought I would hate it. The adult humour mostly went over my son's head, and the drug humour set my mom off a bit. All in all, my wife and I had a good laugh at the content and my mother's reactions.",Grandma's Boy

But then i saw Grandma's Boy and he is hilarious in it. But the best laughs in the movie come from Nick Swardson, who also shows up in the benchwarmers. Allen Covert is a video game tester name Alex who falls for his new boss (Linda cardinelli from ER). I'm not going to give away the movie so you just have to see it for yourself. Lately all the movies produced by Adam Sandler have been very funny and he should keep doing them.I give Grandma's Boy 8 out of 10 because it is a very funny movie and i enjoyed it a lot. This movie has laughs non-stop and is just simply and greatly hilarious",Grandma's Boy
101,nickcampbell-28464,Come on,4,13 May 2021,An overrated comedy that is talked about way to much. This movie does not deserve the cult following that it has. For those of you that disagree I suggest rewatching it and really considering what you are laughing at. If a list of the top 5 stoner movies were to be made this would have no business being on it.,Grandma's Boy
102,localhero83,"Naughty, nasty, vulgar; brilliantly cast and acted and funny as hell.",10,19 November 2006,"""Grandma's Boy"" is a comedy in the truest sense of the genre, there is only one serious plot line in the whole movie and it is immediately transformed into one of the funniest scenes in the film.I didn't see the movie in a theater, so I don't know how a large audience reaction would have been. However, all of 5 adults in my household - ranging in age from 18 to 59 - laughed 'til it hurt at least 6 or 7 times when we watched the DVD.But just a few names in the supporting cast shows that this was a film brimming with gifted comedic talent. Among others, they include: Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones, Shirley Knight, Kevin Nealon, David Spade and Rob Schneider. Great talent, great writing, great performances make for a great bawdy comedy.I'd put ""Grandma's Boy"" the same category as ""Animal House"". To me it is just as funny. It won't achieve the classic status of the latter because it is neither the first nor the best of its kind. But it is very funny and, for non-prudes, well worth the rental price",Grandma's Boy
103,hunterbick,"Stoner Movie, Stoner Classic",9,18 June 2006,"Now I'll give this movie a 9 just for originality. Even though it only lasted in theaters for a mere three weeks if that, it deserved more. This is the Adam Sandler crew who you've seen in movies like Big Daddy, Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds and Anger Management.Allen Covert plays the main character who misses his rent payment due to his room mate, and is then forced into moving in with his grandma. Now this movie is pure stoner, it's the half baked of the decade, it will be a cult classic and of all the people I have made sit down and watch this, maybe 2 or 3 out of 30 or 40 have found it boring. The movie has a great cast of nobody's who you've seen but don't know their name.Nick Swardson really holds this together and the Character of J.P. is somewhat based on the Gay Robot skit from Adam Sandler's latest C.D. Shhh Don't Tell.To the movie, Alex (Covert) moves in with his Grandma and the story revolves around them trying to make a deadline for bug fixes for the game Eternal Death Slayer 3. It follows the story but also has plenty of side scenes to keep you laughing as the story unfolds. The ending is easy to figure out, yet still funny enough to keep you laughing until the very end.I'd recommend this if you are with some friends and need something to watch and don't know what to go. Don't go in thinking this will be an Oscar caliber movie because it's simply not. It's a movie that will be a classic, and you will remember for a long time to come.",Grandma's Boy

This is in my top 10 with SuperBad, Office Space, Anchorman, Talladega Nights to name a few.I must say it has incredible repeat viewing qualities, which to me, separates the good comedies from the great ones. If you like any of the movies above, you may be pleasantly surprised. I think it's even more appealing to techies, as the story revolves around a video game development company. Not sure why this movie doesn't get the props it deserves.The music music soundtrack is good also.",Grandma's Boy

The only reason I can see for it not making any bank is the fact that it did not having a ""name"" actor in the film. Grandma's Boy has got to be the funniest movie I've seen since Anchorman: The legend of Ron Burgundy. I actually was choking on my popcorn I was laughing that much! The film follows video game tester and stoner Alex (a Mel Gibson looking Allen Covert) has he gets the ass from his apartment and has to live with his Grandma (Doris Roberts) and her two roommates (Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight). To make himself sound cool to his much younger co-workers, Alex makes out that he is living with 3 sex mad hot girls. This comes back to haunt him when he finds himself fancying new employee Samantha (Linda Cardellini). The film was produced by Adam Sandlers Happy Madison Production company so the film is full of Sandler alumni (including cameos from Rob Schneider and David Spade). If your looking for a film with no deep meaning and it's only intention is to make you laugh at gross out and inappropriate humour, this is the film for you.",Grandma's Boy
106,Sublime50lbc,A Comedy for Gamers,10,13 December 2005,"I was lucky enough to catch this at an advanced screening at GameSpot's G.A.M.E. expo and I enjoyed every bit of it. I couldn't argue one bit that they decided to show it at this certain event because the film fit so perfectly.The movie is no more and no less than any other typical Happy Madison production, which proves to be a good thing for their formula. However, this movie seems to tailor to gamers much more than Happy Gillmore would and it does it really well.The comedy is mostly nonstop. Was this because I was smitten to the movie as I was waiting in the long line to get into the theater, holding my Signed poster and free Grandma's Boy merchandise? Perhaps..But regardless, I enjoyed every second of it.I must admit that the whole movie is set to one tone by the first main joke of the movie. Letting this joke slip will lose much of it's effect, but it truly sets the tone of the movie, letting the audience know that it's definitely a comedy with strong scenes that just stick with you.Hilarious for Gamers but Good for just anyone.",Grandma's Boy
107,ccrespo182,"a perfect example of why critics usually don't ""get it""",9,24 May 2006,"In the pantheon of the ill-explored genre that is ""Stoner Comedy"" (come on, netflix, where's the Stoner Comedy link?), Grandma's Boy manages to be one of the funniest. Which isn't hard to do, cause there aren't many good stoner comedies out there. Nothing will beat Up In Smoke for obvious reasons, and in the last ten years, the best we've been given is Half Baked and Harold and Kumar. How High falls in there somewhere in terms of stoner films, and thats about it. Otherwise you have stoner schlock like The Stoned Age and laaaaaaaaame DTV movies featuring bad actors from overrated TV shows (i'm looking in your direction Matthew Perry). Movies that are made by people who couldn't tell you the difference between a sack of hydroponically grown sensamillia and a sack of oregano, let alone could make a film that could be funny for 90 minutes at a time.Grandmas Boy, on the other hand, gets it right. It a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and knows you shouldn't either. Allen Covert surprised me by carrying a movie with seemingly no effort as the lead, and Linda Cardellini looked smoking hot doing a karaoke version of Salt n Pepa's Push It. But the strength comes from the supporting cast, and how people like Peter Dante and Nick Swardson made the most of their on screen time. Someone tell Covert to write a Dante And Dr Chakalu Go to Africa movie. That would be amazing.This movie was panned by critics when it came out (a quick glance over at RottenTomatos shows a rating of 17% out of almost 50 reviews), had a theatrical life of all of 2 weeks in the middle of January and quickly disappeared. Now that its on DVD, i have complete faith that this movie will find its audience, and that audience will be bigger than expected.Grandma's Boy is awesome, and if you don't get it, then you are probably an 88 year woman who has never smoked a spliff or played Mike Tyson's Punch-Out.

108,anthony_ballis,Wow. Awful.,1,23 October 2017,"I get what they were trying to do. A stoner film with randomness, drugs, gross humour and tits rolled together like a tight joint. This ""film"" fails in every category.The 'plot':A 35 year old man (going on 50) is a video game tester. He gets evicted as his room mate spends all their money on hookers. Apparently the protagonist was not able to find a flat to rent so he moves into his friends house who has a clear learning disability. He then ejaculates on his mother while jacking it to a doll then moves in with his grandmother and her friends. He then meets a pretty prop who he wants to have sex with. Everyone derides and ridicules one loser (who is also a 'genius prodigy' responsible for the rest having jobs), but the other losers are celebrated and are apparently cool dudes who normal professional women adore? Villain is defeated when the protagonists grandmother beats him in a video game clearly made using Unreal Engine that he apparent coded on an Xbox (not a computer, only has one copy as an XBox disc?). A chimpanzee fights an elephant. The EndFeaturing:-Jonah Hill sucking on a tit -Sexual predator seduces slightly retarded man-child who is young enough to be her grandson (not creepy unless its the other way around apparently) -Women portrayed as and called whores throughout the film -Unnecessary randomness -45 year olds playing 30 year olds acting like 15 year olds. -Desperate virgins -Idiotic writing -Awful acting -Unlikeable protagonist -Ridiculous caricatures and stereotypes -Wasted talent -Fart jokes just becauseand much, much more.

109,tatashady,Great starring role for Covert and Dante,10,23 September 2006,"I am a big fan of Adam Sandler's movies and always have a good time looking for the kooky character Allen Covert plays. If you look hard, you will find him in almost every one. Peter Dante and John Loughran are two other frequent players in Sandler's movies that you have to watch for. Sometimes they have bigger parts, most notably in Little Nicky. It was great to see a movie that showcased the talents of Covert and Dante. If Dante doesn't smoke pot for real he deserves an Oscar, because he has nailed the stoner character to a tee. He must've been so stoned that they named the character Dante so he would know when they were talking to him. The DVD extras are great and especially the chimp with Dante. I just hope we get to see more movies featuring these guys. And the IMDb ""weighted"" ratings are a farce. This movie has an average of ""8"" but gets knocked down to ""6.5"" or something. I give it a ""10"" and really don't care what the ""ratings"" are.",Grandma's Boy

I also showed this to a friend of mine who is really picky and he was laughing all the way too! This was funnier than 40 Year Old Virgin (which I felt had a lot of hype) and 10,000 times funnier than Wedding Crashers(thumbs down... wasn't laugh out loud for me).I gave Grandma's Boy a 10 because I have seen about 3 times in less than a month.

I have seen movies that are extremely funny, but with bad stories and i wouldn't give them a good grade because of that fact. This movie is extremely funny and has a great story compared to most other comedy movies. It is better than Knocked Up and movies like that, in my opinion, because it never gets too serious. It stays funny the whole way through. I mostly enjoyed this movie because it is about video game testers and drugs. If that is not the type of movies you like it may not be for you.

It sort of reminded me of Bob and Doug McKenzie's ""Strange Brew"" as a story. Some (not many) of the one liners were classic. Most of the actors have done well in other movies. It's not like they chose to suck just for this movie.This is a perfect example of how an inept director can ruin a movie. It was also quite obvious that the number of camera angles were very limited for certain locations visited regularly throughout the movie, like a TV show. This gave the unconscious effect of the movie being no better than a sitcom.Happy Madison sold that piece of crap Little Nicky (and Zohan), I doubt they'll have a problem selling this.

I'm tough on comedies as I don't find most very funny, but a I did get a lot of laughs out of this one. The Dance Dance Revolution scene is a CLASSIC! I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.

But if you happen to be someone who likes movies such as ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and/or ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" go and see this movie, because what some people don't understand is that most people don't go to see movies for their writing, they go to have fun and to be entertained.

120,novusopiateseclorum-1,Comedy At It's Worst,1,9 May 2007,"Let me start this review by saying i was never a big fan of what Sandler and his cronies were able to accomplish, but after seeing this film, i can say with confidence that they have hit absolute rock bottom.This is far and away one of the worst comedies i have ever seen. the writing is atrocious, the acting is worse, every single joke runs out of gas and falls flat within seconds, and i can honestly say i did not even break a smile this entire movie. it's just one weak setup, and an even weaker punchline for an hour and a half. even the actors act like they want nothing to do with this picture, with the amount of effort they put into this production.lets see if we can find a plot, as slim as it is. this is the story of slacker/stoner guy, Alex, who makes his living testing video games and smoking weed. his life is dramatically shifted (well, not really), when he has to move in with his grandmother after getting kicked out of his house because he has forgotten to pay the rent. this is not before, mind you, he is kicked out of his friend's house, who seems to be a 12 year old trapped in a 26 year old's body, for pleasuring himself to a Barbie doll. this is the kind of half baked sophomoric trash that is shoved down the vewiers throat for the next hour or so.and then blah blah blah, he parties, smokes more weed, plays video games, and then beats some weird supervisor at his work at a video game he created, wins the girl, smokes more weed, tells some fart jokes, and the credits roll. you get the idea.there is not one redeeming quality or saving grace to this pile of garbage that the happy Madison company has declared a movie. the acting is so halfhearted that i've been convinced that no one in this movie even wanted to make it. the writing is just plain awful, filled with undeveloped jokes, plots, characters and punchlines, that you will most likely spend the entire movie cringing instead of laughing. nothing is entertaining, or even remotely funny about the film, instead it is an exercise in exactly what not to do in a movie. those who enjoy watching 80 year old women mistakenly eat pot brownies and jokes that make Carlos Munich look like Lenny Bruce, then this is right up your alley. but for the rest of us, steer clear from this catastrophic misfire of a movie.",Grandma's Boy
121,spartanhockey,Not cool,5,30 June 2007,It was an OK movie. I thought it was basically a retarded movie with some retarded jokes and only some of them were funny. Like JP's robot was funny maybe the first time. And I laughed at the bong flowerpot but thats about it if I can remember. The hot video game girl was a plus as she was extremely hot. But I could have easily got on my laptop and watched some porn at the same time if I wanted to see tits. Everything in their movie was retarded. I am actually a mature guy so I couldn't laugh at immature child crap like this. Considering its rated R there probably arnt a lot of kids going to watch this who would appreciate this humor. I watch about 1-2 movies a day so I know a bad movie when I see one and grandmas boy sucks.,Grandma's Boy
122,smapdie,An Adam Sandler movie...on weed,4,8 January 2006,"I had high hopes going into this movie. I wanted to see something light and stumbled upon this film, which was basically an Adam Sandler movie without Adam Sandler. It's his production company, several of his his usual cast of players (Allen Covert, Peter Dante and Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider in small roles) and a scanty plot that promises laughs. I'm glad I caught a matinée because this one was sadly not worth full price.The film follows a video game tester (Covert, who I was happy to see in a starring role) who is thrown out of his apartment and ends up living with his grandmother and her two roommates (Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight). I felt that this movie was missing something to make it feel complete; later I discovered this thing was a story arc. This movie doesn't have a conflict to push it along until 15 minutes until the end, where the head of the company steals the game the main character's been working on. Until that point, Covert was basically just smoking a lot of weed (this movie makes Half Baked look like a Disney movie) and pretending he was living with three nymphos who were distracting him from completing his work. There are funny moments, but little to keep you truly engaged.Wait until this movie comes out on video, where you can enjoy this movie with the herbal refreshment it features prominently. It would probably be far funnier that way. It was an OK effort, but nothing special.",Grandma's Boy

Don't know how many times they called the girls for whores ... It may sound pretentious but it might makesome who see the movie think it's okay to talk about women that way. Nowmost were virgins and did not socialize with so many women, which perhaps explains why they objectifies women all the time. There was even some gay joke I don't think was okay and it was maybe a little too pro drugs. Although the story was quite predictable, it was perhaps a little disappointing.

I have watched this movie 5 times this weekend and it has totally made me forget I work for an idiot. This movie will absolutely cheer you up if you are grinding away all week, like to get high, and are over 30. Kudos to Adam Sandler's production company for putting this masterpiece together and leaving him out of it. Rob Schneider was even awesome in it.

125,hippo_butt2000,Funny as hell!,8,31 May 2006,"It may not be Amelie, or Terminal, but still a totally hilarious movie! Although many critics dismiss this as a ""run of the mill"" comedy, it's still a pretty good watch.The movie is like a stoner flick, crossed with Little Nicky. The storyline, in a nutshell, is basically an over-exaggerated snippet of a game tester's life. It has a template of a generic Adam Sandler type comedy, and most of the plot points can be guessed by a monkey, but the whole movie isn't based on it. In fact, the storyline isn't really even that good. But, what IS good, are the jokes and characters that are in the movie.Nearly all the characters are pretty funny and the script is hilariously written. You'll stumble upon cliché moments, but soon after they'll turn it around with over-the-top hilarity. Although, each character is based on a stereotype or cliché, they all have their own quirks, making them feel original and fun.A note to watchers, don't take the movie at all seriously! In fact, just take whatever's coming and try to run with it. Watch with a group of buddies if you're a dude, and if you've got a girlfriend, it's a pretty good way to lighten the mood.

I think it's mistakenly classified as a stoner movie - it's not, really. It's aimed at the counterculture. The kind of person that browses jinx.com for t-shirts, relies solely on digg.com for their information, and can actually identify the fighting game that Sam and Alex were playing at the party.You can tell that the writers knew exactly who they were targeting when writing this movie and that they themselves are a member of the group. None of it feels like forced attempts by some out-of-touch person to appeal to gamers or anything.JP's robot thing got annoying, but that was that was the purpose of it, I guess. Some of the acting feels a little stiff at time, but overall the cast is funny and largely present the material in a very natural way. I remember the advertisements making it look like another stupid Adam Sandler flick sans Sandler himself, but was really surprised at how great it was once I actually saw it. It's good to see these guys break off and do their own stuff, especially since it turned out so good. I've recommended this movie to people who wouldn't have seen it normally and they all say that they loved it, too.It's not for everyone, but those who get it will feel a real connection to the characters.

I always enjoyed Doris Roberts on the well known TV show ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" but I thought she would never do a movie like this but I guess I was wrong, She is great as an naive Grandma who does pretty crazy things. The plot is about a man who is kicked out of his apartment and is forced to live with his Grandma and her two old lady friends and trying to still keep being good at what he does best which is video game testing at a company ran by a weird spiritual boss and a nutty video game designer named JP who acts like a robot.

It really does have enough power to make you think that you were smoking pot.",Grandma's Boy
130,dippitydevil,Super funny for anyone with gamer friends,8,19 May 2006,"I had never heard of this movie when my brother brought it over for me to watch. The Happy Madison company has never disappointed so there were high hopes for this movie. I was a little unsure since Sandler is not in the movie at all but his usual supporting cast held their own in this hilarious movie. These guys are like the new Cheech and Chong. Their drug usage and gratuitous tit shots may offend but when you add great actresses like Shirley Jones and Doris Roberts, the film rounds out to be incredibly witty and heartfelt in a way that even the most jaded and cynical person won't feel like puking in the corner because it got too soft in the end. Even the 40 Year old Virgin has nothing on some of these guys. They are super nerds with no shame in the fact that they can kick butt on any game out there. This is truly an underrated film that more people need to see.",Grandma's Boy
131,KVMalinwa,Unexpectedly funny!,9,23 October 2019,"Going into this movie with not that much hope of seeing a decent movie, I was surprised. Not because of the good acting, in-depth characters, but the movie was hilarious. I laughed so much, just because of the movie being so silly. Very enjoyable to watch with friends or even alone.",Grandma's Boy
132,marton-10,over 20? into Xbox? still hanging with your parents? you need to see this one d00d! :D,9,4 September 2006,"Needless to say I'm not a movie aesthete having rated Grandma's Boy 9 out of 10, all I'm into is a good laugh. If a movie doesn't entertain it bores, as far as I'm concerned. if you too are that sorta guy when it comes to movies, you will love this one. i wasn't expecting much TBH, i just popped it in around midnight thinking i will watch it for an hour or so and then go to sleep when the guy kisses the girl or when the bad guy stops hating the good guys or something greasy like that. this movie however, has a very good rhythm, first of all, i think it has just the right amount (very little) of love content in it and also, it avoids the boring and the annoying almost perfectly. the only noticeable mistake was using the character of Bea, who is too stupid to be real or funny for that matter, whereas other characters are just as stupid as probably most of your mates are which makes'em completely easy to relate to. To give Rob Schneider (he has such a funny accent in this one, it's fab) one or two more scenes or/and drop Bea would have been a good idea, but i can't think of anything else that they could have done better while making a movie about Xbox-loving, weed-smoking,25+ 35+ infantile guys.If you own a steering wheel with your Xbox, wear the same gear you wore in high school, know the middle name of Eric Cartman and like to smoke a blunt every now and then in Amsterdam where it's legal, this movie - sadly enough - won't get you a cute girlfriend, proper social life or a decent job (you need to sort that out yourself) but it will get you 100% of your RDA in laughing at yourself, it certainly did to me.",Grandma's Boy
133,adedavies,Guilty Pleasure,5,1 May 2008,"Oh I feel so bad. I watched this film this afternoon when I didn't have the strength to resist. I couldn't help myself but I laughed out loud a number of times. I even found myself explaining the plot (sic) to my wife who had missed the beginning. Yes most of the jokes were juvenile, but it had some appeal. I even found myself being concerned for the welfare of the main character. OK so we know this was not Oscar potential but it was entertaining. This is nothing like the usual films I watch but as I mentioned before, this guilty pleasure made me laugh enough to offer some praise. Enjoy but don't expect too much! Oh, I wonder, is it well known that Allen Covert looks like Mel Gibson?",Grandma's Boy
134,Doggpants,Best movie,10,7 July 2007,"Grandma's Boy has got to be one of the best stoner comedies ever made! Even though it was considered rated R most people 14-24 would find it funniest. (high schoolers & College kids). The one character that brings out the best comedy in this film is Dante (Peter Dante). He is probably the best part of the whole friggin film. My dad and many other people want to see him in like a movie about dante, or in other stoner comedies. He played the roll in excellence. Whats also great is that it's very re-watchable, because of its lack of plot, and re-laughable jokes. Overall this is one of my favourite movies, and it completely underrated by the public, go check it out!",Grandma's Boy
135,Crazybmb3,Rocks Dude,9,7 August 2007,Dudes this movies is amazing I mean pot and video games at the same time thats something to watch. The movie is awesome I love how most people in the movie act like they have no idea what their doing. THe karate monkey is sick to I love when it drops kick the main character dude down the stairs and Dante with all his animals he's crazy man. ONe of the funniest parts is when they smoke all the crazy pot to-gather and act like they are playing video games when nothing is on the screen especially the monkey. This movie is amazing and anyone that says other wise is just not very smart or is to smart to appreciation something that in voles pot and video games.,Grandma's Boy
136,ndrb500,A Guilty Pleasure,8,27 November 2007,"Okay....I feel asleep on the couch and woke up to see this film starting with an old vedio game I use to play with the credits going by. I almost turned it off when I saw Adam Sandler's name, but I thought I'll give it a shot. After all...Shirley Jones is in it, and I have had the hots for Shirley since The Partridge Family days. The episode were Shirley wore hot-pants....very sexy! Ten minutes into the film....I was laughing out loud! How many of us know a headcase like Dante? This movie didn't get near the credit it deserved when it was out. Heck, even the cable company and their silly rating system gave it one star, meaning bad to poor. This is a funny film! Allen Covert gets all the credit here. He was simply great as the ""Old Bush""...Very funny! Nick Swardson was very good as his side-kick Jeff...The part about the bed made me laugh...I know a guy who still has one of those...Very sad indeed. Linda Cardellini was also extra hot as Samantha, the girl-love interest in the film. Everyone was quite good, even David Spade was funny...Which is rare! The only mark down is for Kevin Nealon as Mr. Cheezle, the owner of the company where all the vido geeks work. Every time he is on the screen....the films drags to a hualt! Not funny! But watch this film......You'll laugh!",Grandma's Boy
137,thelaw84,Painfully unfunny - And I'm a big fan of stoner films,3,13 May 2013,"I managed to get through half hour of this film before the cringe factor got too much. The lead is terribly miscast, he has no comic timing at all and just doesn't look like a 'computer games tester and stoner'. He looks clearly older than his characters 35 years too.I am all down for gross out humour but I expect it to be funny. There was just an eerie silence for half hour when I watched this film with some friends. Nobody 'got it' at all and you shouldn't have to even engage your brain to laugh when watching this sort of film.Harold and Kumar, Pineapple Express, How High are some of my favourite comedy movies outright. When it comes to stoner films I am not hard to please.This was just terrible. Sorry. I really hoped it would be good after reading some positive reviews on here but I was totally let down.",Grandma's Boy
138,ireallylike22,I laughed and I laughed - Much better than any comedy last year.,9,9 January 2006,"This movie was promoted totally wrong. It will become a DVD cult film. GUARANTEED. It's a movie about smoking pot, sex jokes, and playing video games. If you enjoy these activities you will really enjoy this movie. If you are not into that stuff I have no idea how you will feel about it. I was pleasantly surprised how much I laughed.David Spade's weaK, WEAK, cameo is the only low point in the film. David Spade should return any payment he received no matter how small because his performance sucked. Hey, Davie, way to phone it in, I hope you didn't exceed your minutes.All the supporting characters do a really good job. If you liked that pathetic substitute for a pot movie called Half Baked, this is the fully realized movie they pretended to make.Smoke some wacky tobaccy in the parking lot and see this movie.",Grandma's Boy
139,booeythang,I went back again!,10,19 January 2006,"Never in my life have i went to see a movie playing in theater more than once. You get those people who have gone to LOTR or star wars 3 or 5 times, once was enough for me. Of all movies in the world that I could see for a second time, Grandma's Boy was the one that did it for me. Not only did i see it twice in theater but I Paid twice to see it! No sneaking in, no illegal downloading...I have supported this movie! And why? Because never in my life have i found a movie that made me laugh so much. And i laughed just as much the second time as I did the first, perhaps more. Joel Moore owns this movie. He plays his character so well that you can't help but wonder how he did it. Makes me want to get metal legs too.I'm not saying everyone will find this movie funny...if you've never smoked a joint, played a video game or made a sexually explicit comment....well then yeah you'll probably sit through this like a wet fish. A sick sense of humor is kind of a must. Maybe you have to be a bit of a dork, i dunno. Fact is it had a good beginning, middle and ending and what could be better than that? (Even award winning Backdoor Mountain left me disappointed with the ending!?!) SO that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. 10/10 for the best comedy of the year...and two thumbs down to the critics who are obviously too old and boring to find the crazyness of youth amusing.",Grandma's Boy
140,sessi,Best comedy since Super Troopers,9,1 June 2006,"OMG! This movie is hilarious! ""That's right monkey...karate chop that elephant!"" Need I say more? I do?! Okay...Finally a movie that can compete with Super Troopers. And that's saying a lot! There have been many attempts to reach the heights of that movie and Grandma's Boy did it. Most Happy-Madison productions are pretty good, but I think the 3 old ladies really make this movie. I mean the Partridge family MOM is a sex fiend. I never would've guessed it in a million years. I ended up watching this movie twice in one week...I loved it that much! This is your typical stoner movie and yet more. So, my advice to you is; Sit down, get comfortable and spark it! Don't forget the munchies! And watch out for the following...deer or antlers, Frankenstein, and the bomb! One last thing to remember; ""Nobody f***s with a lion!""",Grandma's Boy
141,apmj182,Ha!,5,7 January 2006,"Now I will be the first to admit that I shot this film down before I even saw it, but oh how wrong I was! I'm not saying that it is deserving of an Oscar Nom, or that it rivals Sandlers previous films, even though he isn't in it, but I am saying that this film is surprisingly funny and witty. Also I think that too many people were confused with the film and it's plot, because I saw my fair share of preteens in the theater with their parents. I don't know if the parents where smoking as much as the characters in the film, but I do know one thing, this is not a movie for the youngsters. I hope people see this movie for what it is, a hilarious film that teaches you nothing except for the fact that monkeys can kick some serious ass, and that that bitch from the Partridge is a freaky skank! Gotta love her!",Grandma's Boy
142,jaklyn_rose,Funniest movie I've seen in a long time.,8,28 May 2006,"As the title says, funniest movie I've seen in a while. I literally laughed out loud at all of the jokes. I loved the video game references. The characters were memorable, and this movie had some of the most memorable quotes for me. For some, the movie is a little immature, and I think most people will a agree that the story line isn't altogether magnificent. I guess one could say that there really was no story, or problem. But, that's not what matters. This movie is extremely fun to watch. However, I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't like sex and drug jokes. Like I said, the movie may be silly for some, but to me, it's a hilarious movie for when you just want something to laugh at.",Grandma's Boy
143,elizasgotit,The best stoner movie EVER,9,19 May 2006,"This movie made me laugh all the way through, and watching it the next 10 times after that made me laugh too, which is usually hard to do. I wont lie, you'll probably appreciate this movie much more if your a stoner or are stoned at the time. Because then you just seem to get a bunch of stuff you wouldn't if you were sober.The character J.P was hilarious, and I loved Linda Cardellini's character Sammantha. There was just so much random stuff, even in posters in the background that just makes you go WTF?? Its a really fun movie, and I recommend that you buy the DVD and watch the Unrated version.Really, the point is just to make you laugh, so if your one of those people who like movies with a really strong plot, this isn't for you.",Grandma's Boy

IF, however, you specialize in the rectal transport of steel rods, this movie is not for you.Watching Alex deal with an idiot-savant computer designer who thinks he is a robot, deal with his immature underage coworkers, and all the problems that come with living in his grandparent's house will have you rolling in the aisles, or the floor in front of your couch, as the case may be.A must-see for any and all who enjoy ""dumb-humor"" and the occasional fart joke.",Grandma's Boy
145,full_can_of_beer,Absolutely Hilarious!,9,4 January 2007,One of the best stoner films i have seen in a long while. Even though I love such movies as Harold and kumar go to white-castle. I'd have to say this one was a lot funnier. With snappy lines the movie was great. Decent plot made the movie had just what it needed to be a classic stoner flick.i went to rent this movie with low expectations and when I had finished watching the movie even my father (who is somewhat strict) thought it was hilarious. See this movie. I was surprised to see that this movie had only a 6.6 on IMDb.com and see all of the comments that were negative. All in all this was a great movie and i would suggest it to anyone who likes a fun loving silly movie. oh and IMO i think that guy DOES look like Mel Gibson!,Grandma's Boy
146,italianicesexybeast,Instant classic,10,11 January 2020,Excellent comedy. Brilliant punchlines and surprises. The comedy never gets old. When we have no movie lined up we have no problem watching Grandma's Boy together.,Grandma's Boy
147,whitejade-1,My new favorite movie,9,2 August 2006,"I don't know why this movie flopped... we rented it through netflix expecting that it would be reminiscent of Little Nicky. It was, in fact, very amusing! I suppose it has a narrow audience... 20-30 year old boys who incessantly play video games... but being married to one, I could certainly relate. I guess because Adam didn't actually star in it, people didn't bother to go see it. A shame, really. Yes, a lot of the comedy is goofy and sophomoric, but at least its different and there's only one gross scene. Plus, you get to see the mother from Everybody Loves Raymond drunk and high off her rocker... And the mom from the Patridge Family horny as a toad... ! That's funny enough in itself!",Grandma's Boy
148,difuncted_reble,MUST see for ALL gamers!,7,22 May 2006,"If you are a gamer and know of the culture and habits of the gaming community this movie is a kick to watch. Whats great is the opening credits as it runs through a bit of Galaga, also the scene with a 'Tomb Raider-like' doll that is both disturbing and hilarious. Especially for those prospective Game Designers out there, watch as the dramatized events in a fictitious studio spiral out with crude humor. Only watchable by some of the most liberal, others may be harshly offended by constant references to sex, violence, sex, drugs and drugs. Conservatives with sticks shoved where the sun don't shine, need not watch or reply. 7 of 10 for hilarious parody (somewhat truthful) rendition of the real lives of many gamers... and to see a monkey (with a red belt in karate) give the smackdown on many a stoner and driving a golf cart. ;)",Grandma's Boy
149,skeptic_holly,Dirty talk and unnatural acting,3,5 June 2006,"I must say I was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an Adam Sandler ""Happy Madison"" production and I am usually attracted to that type of silly humour.There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense at all. I cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. Overall I was very unimpressed with this film and I do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it.",Grandma's Boy

JP makes this movie funny, with the robot voice, neat-combed mullet and Matrix style trench coat! Who sings that song on Dance Dance Revolution UltraMix 2 , when that first guy bobby plays it? Anyone who doesn't find this movie funny does not get the humor in it, they are not down to earth! This is way better than Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle! Best stoner movie since Cheech and Chong's Nice Dreams! The only people who hate this movie is because they don't ""GET IT"". Or they hate that this movie is true and it makes fun of video game geektoids.LOL. This movie would suck if it didn't have the actor Joel Moore(JP). His best robot voice line is ""Adios turd Nuggets"".I think he is more funny than weird in this flick. I highly recommend this movie!",Grandma's Boy
151,admitchell-1,More proof that critics are full of it...,10,13 June 2006,"Not the greatest movie ever made, but this movie is really all about having fun and a few laughs. Playing video games is fun. Trash talking your friends is fun. Taking bong hits is fun. If there's a message in Grandma's Boy, and by God I hope there isn't, it's to have fun, don't take anything too seriously and everything else will take care of itself. I haven't laughed this hard at a Happy Madison production in a long time. Rob Schneider's cameo is awesome, while Allen Covert and Peter Dante finally get some of the respect they deserve. Adam Sandler puts them in all his movies for one reason, and that's because they're funny. Kevin Nealon was great in his small part as well, as were Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight. The real revelation was Nick Swardson who as Jeff delivers all the best lines with amazing facial expressions and timing. Can't wait to see his next project.Jeff (talking to a room full of game geeks about scoring with a much older lady): Yes, that is correct, she did give Charlie Chaplin a hand job. Kane (puts hand up): Did she invent the hand job? Jeff: No, good question, but she did come up with the finger up the ass during a blow job trick. Yeah. (After interruption) Jeff: Now who wants to hear about my STD from the silent film era? Hands up...All right. This chick's pussy smelled like the great depression...",Grandma's Boy
152,americanham,Fun Times in Sandler Friend Land,7,25 June 2006,"I always seemed to like the guys that played bit parts in Adam Sandler's movies. So I was real psyched to find a movie that they made on their own. Allen Covert proves he can carry a movie, but with a female lead in Linda Cardellini, it would make you try real hard to do a good job.The movie is not the best of course, and there are some real dumb moments (didn't really dig the JP character talking in a computer voice all the time), but it is a movie that is fun to watch. If you are looking just to laugh and say ""that was stupid"" and then watch it a hundred times more, than this is your film. If you are looking for a movie to shake all other cinematic endeavors I would look elsewhere.",Grandma's Boy
153,doggyg2405,Mel Gibson look alike,9,30 June 2006,If the main actor was actually Mel Gibson this movie would be on the top ten. It was stupid and funny as hell. I always love a grandma who can kick ass at video games. I don't understand why people are always kicking comedies. The point is not good acting it's being stupid and making people laugh. Even so it takes the same amount of skill to be a comic people always like to kick them. You learn something from comedy just as you would learn it from real life. The message is that a great laugh gives you great feeling as does any other movie. So just have fun and remember it's all in the script just like any other movie. have a good one G.,Grandma's Boy

Make sure you vote 10 :D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~ ' ~ WAtch it lalasdkfj just filling in space watch the movie.. with commentary with out it doesn't matter.

The movie is very fun to watch over and over again. I really think the casting was absolutely outstanding . Adam Sandlers ""Crew"" starring Peter Dante, Allen Covert,Kevin Nealon, Rob Schneider and Jonathan Loughran were the perfect actors for the plots. I think if you put all those guy in a room and just leave them alone for a while you could film them and make a full length movie of jokes and perverted humor.But still i recommend this movie the best stoner/perverted movie in 2006",Grandma's Boy

158,supa-italiano,Laugh Out Loud Funny,9,20 August 2006,"This movie is without a doubt one of the top comedic performances in the past five years. I thought the combination of Peter Dante and Allen Covert would be just flat out bad without Adam Sandler and i'm proud to say they proved me wrong. Doris Roberts plays a perfect role as an innocent grandmother just wanting to spoil her grandson and Nick Swardson plays the best role with his quirky comebacks, 1-liners, and usual jokes he has in his disposal. This movie will make you laugh from beginning to end and the plot was alright considering it can be labeled a ""stoner film"".

I am shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade etc., would put their names on this piece of crap. Worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former SNL players. What more can I say? How could such tasteless, extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent!! Maybe I have lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but I cannot remember a movie that I have disliked this much in a long time. What a waste of 2 hours I will never get back.",Grandma's Boy
160,iheartsaturn,"Not the best, but can bring many fun laughs",5,4 August 2008,"I've only seen this movie once, and I'm literally in the middle of my second view as I type this. I went on this site out of curiosity to see what other people have thought of it, and I have to say I haven't agreed with a single other review.Some people are saying it's the best movie. It's not. No way in hell. It's not the best in any way, ever.Others, though, are saying that it's a piece of trash and that anyone who likes it is ""retarded"". It's not trash. If it was, it wouldn't have received such good review from so many people. And I suggest to these people that they accept that everyone has different taste, and that they should change their attitude.Anyways, onto the movie. Like I said, it's not the best. The acting is OK, and the directing style when it comes to camera and lighting and everything is very simplistic (not to say that's bad). The writing could be better, but in some senses is oddly realistic. And as for the plot... I think it would fit much better as a sitcom more then a movie. It's very sub-par in movie form.The movie made me laugh on several occasions. But instead of the jokes all tying into the plot, it seems much more like sequences of inside jokes and funny anecdotes then anything else. Sometimes, though, that's enough. A movie is meant to entertain, and the creators of this movie succeeded. Albeit not on the best level, but either way, they succeeded.One problem- the demographic these jokes aim for is very focused. Only a few people outside of the gamer/stoner groups would enjoy them. FYI, I'm in the gamer. Although this may have been on purpose, it was still a slight mistake, as a few normal jokes that everyone could enjoy could easily have been stuck in there.In conclusion, if you don't mind dealing with a somewhat laid back plot to enjoy a bunch of somewhat dirty, somewhat nerdy, Family Guy/Robot Chicken-like jokes, then this movie is worth renting at the very least.",Grandma's Boy

That is why i registered and had to give my opinion.I am, a die hard gamer and 27 years old, so the story got my attention.I watched it together with my partner but did not see a bad movie like this in months. Why it was bad? Some reasons. First the acting is really bad. I never believed the impression they tried to give me. Second, the jokes aren't really good. Sometimes i got a smile but the most of the time i just looked at my partner and we laugh, just because it all looked stupid.Third reason is the story line. I could tell very often what the next scene would be. In short, predictable.Really surprised why the movie has ( at the moment ) a 6.8 If you look at the facts, this movie should be better then: The Nutty Professor or Bruce Almighty.My opinion: not even close. But maybe i am getting old :) See for yourself.",Grandma's Boy

As many others have said, this isn't highbrow comedy, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. The puns and gags are highly memorable, and there are a lot of lovable actors, many of which you wouldn't expect to see in a movie like this, which makes them even more entertaining.Whenever my friends have a LAN, we have to watch this movie at least once, as most of them are game designers. Many people have said that the movie is unrealistic, but beyond the obvious physical and logistical deviations, the general attitude and behavior of the characters isn't too far off from what I see when I've been around my friends.I can't believe anyone could rate this a 1.

All spectra's of weed users are seen in this movie. For example, the complete retardation of Dantes, the dealer, showing the effects of weed making you stupid.

I was looking forward to some mediocre comedy and what I got was NON stop laughing.NEVER has a movie so wonderfully captured life as a stoner/gamer/geek.CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON! To break it down as simple as possible, it is about a 30-something video game tester who has to live with his grandmother for a while in order for him to gather himself to get a new pad.This is NOT the type of movie where the main character has ""life realizations"" and grows up and becomes more responsible. It's... ITS'S Awesome. Just go see it.Oh, and I ALMOST took my son to this... glad I didn't because it isn't a family friendly film.",Grandma's Boy

This subculture consists of potheads that are not complete slackers, but work a stoner-savvy job day to day. Several scenes in the film can serve as a flashback to stoner's, accurately portraying stoner mishaps that couldn't be made up. one instance the main character Alex is shone sneaking in to his grandmothers house after a night of toking,and judging from his paranoia, Alex is on cloud nine. Before sneaking up to bed Alex makes his way to the kitchen and raids the fridge, pulling out a feast of left overs. due to lack of microwave, Alex is forced to heat the food up in the oven on a baking sheet. When the food was heated up Alex's munchies took over and he eagerly reaches for the red hot baking sheet with his bare hands. the result is a loud scream and the baking sheet thrown all over the kitchen. - the reason this fact is so relevant to me is that, the first time i saw this scene i was overwhelmed because before then, i thought i was the only stoner to burn himself because he was too hungry from munchies to grab oven mitt.",Grandma's Boy
166,nick-j-corleto,omfg this movie is amazing!!!,10,5 September 2008,Okay so it took a whole 5 years for me to comment on this film because it is in a sense a true stoner movie! Pineapple express has nothing on this movie! It is the funniest thing you can watch while you are either sober or on any type of medically issued drug. This film breaks many barriers which folks of normal background cannot appreciate. There is no reason why this film should not have been nominated for many academy awards including best actor and best supporting actress! If I could have just one day left on the face of this earth I would wish I could spend it with all the people who were in this film and Adam Sandler of course because they make more sense to me than anything that has happened in my life since the trampoline! This movie would be #1 in the box office if it weren't such a stoner movie and that is the only reason it is #1 5 years after the fact!!!! I love the cast!!!!,Grandma's Boy
167,courtneybenedetti,This movie is a funny comedy worth watching.,8,29 September 2008,"Grandma's Boy (2006) gives the slang term ""lol"" a whole new meaning. In today's society with everybody texting and instant messaging, people say ""lol"" even when they don't actually laugh out loud. Watching Grandma's Boy, however, will make you actually laugh out loud! This film is a hysterical comedy about the lives of nerds, video games, drugs, and sex, appealing mostly to audiences over the age of 17. The five main characters in Grandma's Boy are Alex, his grandmother, his best friend Jeff, his boss Samantha, and a coworker JP. This movie opens up with Alex and his roommate playing a video game with a bong sitting on the coffee table in front of them. Alex is a forty year old stoner. He gets high in probably every scene of this movie. Alex ends up getting kicked out of his apartment, and having nowhere to go. The first night on his own he sleeps over his best friend Jeff's house. Jeff is around the same age as Alex and still lives at home with his parents. He sleeps in a car bed with stuffed animals, and loves it. Alex accidentally made a sexual innuendo on Jeff's mother, making it awkward for him to stay the night. He ended up staying at the office.Asleep on his desk with a post-it stuck to his forehead, Alex is awakened by a beautiful young lady who turns out to be his new boss. When they first meet there is a moment of clarity for Alex and soft, happy music playing in the background. This is when he first forms a crush on his new boss. This foreshadowing gives the audience an idea that Alex and Samantha will end up together. Samantha's costumes throughout the movie include little makeup, to give her a natural beauty, and slimming clothes that make her look gorgeous.Throughout the rest of the movie Alex ends up sleeping at his grandmother's house along with her two roommates (hence the title of the film). While living with his grandmother, Alex works on finishing his new game that he has been creating for the past three years. This game is secretive and the only other person that knows about it is his grandmother. When his game gets stolen by JP, Alex and his grandmother have to work together to get it back before JP gets credit for it.Brainasium is a video game company where Alex, Jeff, Samantha, and JP work. Currently they are working on making improvements for their newest game Death Slayer III. JP is a genius and made the original Death Slayer video game when he was only thirteen years old. Throughout the entire movie JP is, to say the least, not normal. He walks around as a robot, making robot noises with his mouth, and speaking like a robot (usually when he is nervous). His costume adds to his weirdness: a black trench coat reaching the floor with his hair slicked back.The lighting in most of the shots is neutral. When Alex and his friends were smoking weed, however, the lighting is usually dark, probably to show that smoking is dangerous. Most camera angles are taken at eye level, and most shots are long or medium shots, except when Alex and Samantha went out to eat. They were getting to know each other on a more personal level and the camera was shooting a close-up of them. Being so up-close and personal with the characters gave the audience a sense of getting to know them as well. Also, during Alex and Samantha's first kiss the camera shot a close-up. In this film, however, there are some mistakes. When Alex teaches his grandmother how to play his game she presses buttons differently from what Alex explains to her. Also, when Alex puts the tray of food in the oven there is a banana on the tray. When he takes it out the banana is no longer there.This comedy is great for anyone with a sense of humor. The only possible side effect of watching Grandma's Boy would be tears of laughter. As stoned as the characters are throughout the movie, it is still hilarious for those in the audience who aren't stoned. If you are not into comedies and hate to laugh, then this movie is definitely not for you.",Grandma's Boy
168,kronosq,Very amusing,8,8 January 2006,"I'm sad to see that more people aren't appreciating this movie. It was a great popcorn comedy in the same manner as 40 Year Old Virgin, Old School and Wedding Crashers. A lot of silly, albeit sick humor, total ridiculousness and just plain delicious stupidity.I laughed out loud several times and left the theatre feeling that I got my money's worth for the evening. There were some well conceived characters in the film, which added to its overall appeal - bringing a little but beyond its simple basis.Covert has proved himself worthy of carrying a film here, so I'm hoping we'll see more of him in the lead from now on. Hopefully something with a little more substance than Grandma's Boy, but still just as much fun.Overall I give this film an 8 out of 10 for what it is meant to be. It's not Amadeus or Citizen Kane, but it's not supposed to be. It succeeds well for its intentions, and I recommend it to anyone looking to have a fun night out with a few drinks and some munchies with good friends.",Grandma's Boy

170,Oo_Hydro_oO,"""Don't judge me, monkey.""",8,24 August 2011,"Allen Covert, who we all know from his character parts in numerous Adam Sandler movies, stars in this film. The movie definitely has a familiar Sandler-type feeling to it, but I thought it worked well with the given cast.It all starts out with a hilarious scene where Alex (Covert) is being evicted from his place while playing video games. It turns out his roommate has acquired a penchant for Filipino hookers and he's spent all the rent money on his addiction. It sounds pretty weak, but it's a great scene and it's really well done.A good number of actors make guest appearances. Rob Schneider is the Middle-Eastern landlord, David Spade is a feminine waiter at a health food restaurant, Kevin Nealon is an overly spiritual boss, the kid from Dodgeball (Joel Moore) plays a video game designing genius who has a robot as part of his dual personality, the mother from Everybody Loves Raymond plays Alex's grandmother... Nick Swardson (who is a professional stand-up comic) is hilarious in his role as Alex's best friend at work. He really adds to the movie with his personality and one-liner delivery.There are some really good lines in this movie, as well as some strikingly funny scenes. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times. If you liked early Sandler movies, you will definitely appreciate this kind of humor. The Unrated version is raunchy and even better than I was expecting it to be. There is also a good deal of bonus material, including some featurettes and deleted scenes.",Grandma's Boy
171,Alexander_Roxborough,How can anyone not find this amusing?,10,9 March 2012,"I've read all of the ""I hate it"" reviews, and honestly... how can you say this film isn't hilarious?""Oh it's not sophisticated enough for my gigantic brain, I lost brain cells watching this"" It's a comedy film, granted you are allowed your own opinions, but you hated it that much to make a review based on how much of a sense of humour you are lacking? Yes, you could argue this is opinion... I just think whoever you people are, you have something wrong with you, marriage failures? University drop outs? There must be some underlying reason for not finding anything funny in this film?This is one of my all-time favourite comedies. I've seen it so many times I can't even count, everyone I have shown it to, has loved it with a passion, so much so, they've gone out of their way to purchase it/download it.I can't praise this film enough, makes me laugh without a doubt, I can quote pretty much the entire film. To also confirm, I am not a horny 13 year old with masturbation problems and you don't have to be to have a sense of humour these days.If you read into each scene, how all of the jokes complement each other, and how the plot unfolds, it's got everything. If you're watching this and you hate it just because of the actors, or because someone you value dearly decided they hated it, and you're going along with it saying it's practically toilet humour, I suggest you watch it alone, focus on what they are doing with their faces, their actions, accents, movements... it's all really hilarious stuff! I bet, most of the people bashing this film, have the utmost of stuck up arse syndrome this world has ever seen, and if something doesn't have the most sophisticated dry humour, they're not interested, living in a private bubble of ignorance to anything in association with an actor/actress or director they don't like.Comedy is about pushing the limits, they execute this perfectly well.For the record, this film doesn't deserve the 10 I have given it, that is my own personal preference. I'd say it deserves a 7, however, I do absolutely adore this! If you haven't seen it, watch it, if you've seen it and hate it, watch it again!",Grandma's Boy

You can't expect it to be the type of movie that people go ape scat over. It's a fun, it's funny, so watch it for funzies.Don't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece, go into this movie expecting a laugh. If you are a gamer or like to laugh at gamers, watch this movie. If you liked 40 Year Old Virgin or Anchorman, watch this movie. If you like the regular Happy Madison films, watch this movie. It's seriously a great flick, it's Rated R for a reason... to make you laugh.Watch the movie. If you don't like it, don't let it bother you anymore. Don't dwell on it for the rest of your life.

173,hawaiinwarrior21,Sleeping in the office.,8,8 February 2007,"It was hilarious when the new boss lady comes in to wake up Alex, her being so hot was very ironic for Alex to ask her if she was the new janitor and the look on her face was as funny as you know what. I love video games and I love this movie and thank god! That Adam Sandler wasn't in it. He would of made it horrible like the movie click, Mr. Deeds, and Eight Crazy Nights. Also I would love it if they stopped doing that ""you can do it!"" line that's been done to death making movies involving the Happy Madison company so horrible! It ruins the whole experience! They should of left it one time with the waterboy and that's it. Even that one time wasn't funny to begin with. That line ruined the experience of the Longest Yard, stupid ass rob Schneider is so retarded! So make more movies like this and quit involving everything from movies before making themselves look so unoriginal.",Grandma's Boy
174,dpking,What a surprise...,10,2 January 2006,"Adam Sandler produces this random comedy and he isn't in it but all of his old friends are, and surprisingly this stoner laden film is a comical success. The story of a lazy middle-aged video game tester who moves in with his grandma has little if any point and that is the beauty of it. All the random acts and completely engrossingly pop-culture themes make this one of the best comedies in recent memory. Allen Colvert takes the main role with all of Sandler's old time sidekicks filling in presenting the largest roles to this date. While the plot may be non-existent it is the characters and absolute hilarity of it all which keeps the movie going and never leaving the viewer time to catch breath from laughing.",Grandma's Boy
175,Tanley,Hoo-Boy!,9,2 June 2006,"Grandma's Boy', is an outrageous gaudy farce in which ALEX, by day is the world's oldest video game tester (a well restrained Allen Covert) but by night is privately developing the next big game ""Demonic"". He gets driven out from his apartment because his roommate has been spending their rent money on hookers, and is forced to move in with his grandmother, LILLY (Doris Roberts, endearing as usual) and her two friends, GRACE (Shirley Jones) and BEA (Shirley Knight, sizzling for her age).Very often does one see a film that isn't trying to be funny, but just is naturally; although the jokes and gags may seem like they are written by a bunch of people on a constant ""high"", the film laughs at itself and thus in turn makes the audience laugh. This is not you ""slip on a banana peel"" comedy, but yes, it does do the job.I highly recommend this film, (JP's performance & his split personality was the funniest) for the humor, the dead pan laughs and an ending where the couple don't hold hands and traipse into the sunset.Enjoy!",Grandma's Boy

Personally, I take what critics say with a grain of salt, and I definitely did with this movie.The concept is simple, a 35-year-old video game tester gets kicked out of his apartment and ends up moving in with his grandmother and her two roommates. The plot isn't that thick, in fact there isn't that much of a plot in my opinion. Nonetheless, there are plenty of good movies out there that don't have a strong plots, and this movie holds its own.The movie is witty, has great one liners, and is overall thoroughly amusing. Sure, it's not a movie that is going to change the way we think about the world, and maybe the Academy will look this movie over. If you're looking for something like that, a movie with meaning, then don't bother. But if you're looking for an hour and a half to kill and have a good amount of laughs along the way, I would definitely say you should see the movie.",Grandma's Boy

Then I actually watched the entire thing and it haven't stopped watching it since. The variety of more than just d**k and weed jokes gives it a broader comedic audience, but the constant use of obscenities still makes it an adult film. The film uses the awkward characters, physical humor and somewhat surprising elements to perfection. Although they might have been backup actors for Sandler, they shine and make their own presence known here.Any Sandler or Kevin Smith fan, this is a must see.",Grandma's Boy

The acting is all solid, but none of the parts are really demanding (we're looking at you Dante, played by Peter Dante who is noted as using legit and not prop weed). The story is a fairly typical light romantic comedy, about video game tester/pothead Alex (Allen Covert) and his new boss Samantha (Linda Cardellini). Through the trials and tribulations of releasing a new video game and copious amounts of smoking, and living with his grandmother, the movie focuses on humanizing the pothead.

Now while I don't mean to disparage these fans, I honestly can't find what worth they see in this movie.I watched with an open mind but quickly got annoyed at the terrible acting of the protagonist, who wasn't able to sell any sort of comedy bit and over-all just gave a flat-ass performance. Long story short the main character is unlikable, unfunny and shallow. This does not make for an entertaining movie experience. This could have been (somewhat) redeemed if the writing was clever and gave the audience a good amount of laughs but sadly every joke made by the main character was cringe-worthy and lazy comedy. Nick Swardson seemed to be the only character in this movie that could sell a joke and get chuckles and this happens far too little. Every thing about this production screams Happy Madison which sadly has become synonymous with lazy and overall terrible movies. I actually rooted against the main character to get the girl. Of course he does but god knows why. If you are interested in this movie because of the positive audience response I wouldn't be fooled, there are much better irreverent and goofy comedies out there that aren't just a cash-in.

184,lambros_99,may the good Lord have mercy on our souls........,2,10 October 2006,"Alright, how someone can actually think this movie is awesome, is so beyond me... I can't even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny, the only character it has going for it, is the evil super nerd game designer, and that gets old after a while. This movie is so predictable, the punchlines are not funny they're forced, you see better acting at the red light district, and the story sucks it's so predictable, you know EXACTLY what's going to happen. Even the characters do not react like they should, try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that you're banging 2 crazy chicks that you live with at the same time, her response wouldn't be (smile) ""ok let's get back to work"". I didn't laugh once during this movie, and I wish I had never seen it or spent 3$ to rent it because that's not even worth it. Adam Sandler produced this movie, I have lost all respect for him. All his movies are the same, his comedy style got old ever since The Waterboy came out, if I knew Adam Sandler had produced this before I rented it...there's no way I would have wasted my time on it. This movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect... ace ventura wasn't a smart comedy movie, it didn't have a killer plot...but it was original and it was hilarious. I'm not knocking the movie because it has 'low-level' humor, i'm knocking it because it sucks, it's a piece of Hollywood crap. If this movie was presented to a production company and din't have ""ADAM SANDLER"" behind it, it would be thrown in the garbage quicker than a used condom. If you want a good movie about pot-culture watch Cheech and Chong, or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets 14-17 year olds, with loud rock music at every possible cut, acting that will make your eyes squint and your stomach turn, and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half. Don't do it.... for the love of God...this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look past all the Hollywood glory behind it.....Hercules in New York used to be the worst movie I had ever seen, but it's actually so bad it's good.

I recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh but don't recommend it for anyone under 17. You see a lot of the same folks that are in most of his movies but you never see him.

This won't win any awards or be number one at the box office, but people will buy this and watch it on DVD over and over. The older actresses were endearing and troopers to go along with some of the scenes.....they must of had a good time making this movie and it shows.

I had even read some reviews about people being angered by some of the content such as stereotyping. Just to let people know, the stereotyping is so thin and there's barely any parts of the movie about it. If people said they were white hookers, black hookers, no one would say one thing. But since they secluded Filipinos, there's an uproar. You're too sensitive and stop blowing your horn trying to get attention. I don't see anyone going crazy after Full Metal Jacket about the plethora of lines about Vietnamese prostitutes! Anyways, the movie itself is constant laugh out loud humor. Adam Sandler and his production group put together a movie that I believe rivals the likes of comedies such as Anchorman, 40 Year Old Virgin, and Wedding Crashers.

I loved seeing Allen Covert in a main role instead of a supporting part and Doris Roberts is great as his grandma.

Crude comments can be funny, but they need a level of cleveriness.Spewing a bunch of obscenity-laden insults in and of itself isn't funny. Did they make this thing up as they went along?

It is like a cheech and chong movie that someone spilled cow manurer on. The gags, if that's what you want to call them are hideous! I felt embarrassed that Adam Sandlers name was on it. I expected a little more from the Happy Madison clan. The prodigy gamer that makes his own sound effects that correlate with his body movement and talks to him self was extremely hard to watch. The young lady, who was to come in to the company to motivate the designers to meet their quota, was the one and only bright spot. How original is a young man getting to sleep with an, ancient, older woman? A guy that ends up stuck on a woman's naked breast all night is just not funny. I will say this, this film was obviously geared toward the pot smoker, I have never been there and if this is what i have to look forward to...I can't!",Grandma's Boy
195,dar2106,An Incredibly Funny Film,10,6 December 2006,"All though i admit this is not a movie that would be enjoyable for those with ""high brow"" humor. But those with ""high"" (aka pot/stoner) humor would absolutely love this movie. This movie received High Times Movie of the Year. For those who enjoy movies like: Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Super Troopers, and Harold and Kumar; you would totally love this movie and find yourself peeing your pants.This movie, while lacking plot, sacrifices nothing for humor. Adam Sandler clearly only disassociated himself from this movie, because of its racy drug content.Anybody in the teen to thirty classes would love this movie. Or anybody that enjoys ""dirty"" humor. The unrated version of this movie is ridiculous and the special features are just as good. With hilarious comedy, and funny goofs.Honestly this movie is a must watch, especially for this with a taste for bud, or those who enjoy drug induced lifestyle, this movie will knock your socks off, and for those who enjoy the occasional brew and enjoy the high school days this movie is a must watch.Sorry if my comment is incoherent I'm really messed uphahaha.living within the true nature of the movielong live Frankenstein Hilarious!!!",Grandma's Boy
196,burnz92,great movie,10,10 December 2006,"grandmas boy is a great movie. It's funny as hell. It's funny because the antics of Alex and his friends are like that of high school/college kids. Its over the top and it is painfully funny. When the credits roll you will be sad. What also makes this movie great is that its just as funny, it not funnier the next time you watch it. Me, myself, I watch this movie all the time. I am a big Jets fan and before every game on Sunday, I watch this. Also the characters are so memorable. They all have really funny personalities oh yeah and Dante and doctor are amazing. There are so many funny scenes but i cant tell u any of them because none of my reviews have spoilers. Although the plot lacks substance, it makes up for it in its humor. Also the humor is great it flows nicely and its the right pace too",Grandma's Boy
197,nogorman11,pleasant surprise,8,7 January 2006,I went to go see Hostel on the opening night but it was sold out and the only other film that was still playing was Grandma's Boy. I went in expecting maybe anothergarbage Happy Madison production like Douche Bigelow or something like that but what I got was one of thefunniest movies I've seen since The 40 Year Old Virgin and it can easily compete with that and Wedding Crashers if your're into that college type humor. Grandma's Boy is an instant classic and I can't wait to get it onDVD.,Grandma's Boy
198,sunstarc10,Better than I thought it would be,8,7 January 2006,I decided to give this one a check for the heck of it. I couldn't have been more surprised. When most movie come out devoid of any humor and called comedies this one delivered. It is not going to win any awards. The acting was very good and the script also was great. I'm glad to see the actors playing Alex and Dante have stepped out of Adam Sandlers shadow. There is also some funny guests with David Spade and others. I do believe this is the only Happy Madison not to have Adam Sandler at all which I believe this time is a good thing. The movie never really seemed to drag on and the previews didn't have all the good jokes. If you are looking for a funny no brain comedy this is your movie.,Grandma's Boy
199,bigbrent769,"if you like stupid silly, this is the godfather",10,6 January 2006,"Funny, very funny. Don't look for anything other then to laugh. If you liked Harold & Kumar, hit your bowl, go to taco bell, then catch a midnight. You will be happy. Alan Covert does a great job at being the straight man for most of the picture. The three old ladies are old pros so when they are just reading a well written joke it works well, I kind thought that they usually did not get the jokes themselves. This movie does a better job at being a stoner movie then Methodman and Redmans horrible HOW HIGH. This one gets the humor delivered without to much painful build. It also tells a better story then Dave ""is that Oprah in my closet"" Chapelles HALF BAKED. This film does continue the recent trend of better stoner films that started with HAROLD & KUMAR.",Grandma's Boy
200,amandamellison,Another hilarious Adam Sandler movie!,10,9 January 2006,"I thought this movie was hilarious!! There is nothing better than a movie about stoned video game testers! I also love Nick Swardson, he is an awesome comic, and I was so glad to see him finally hit a good comedy! I would Definitely recommend this movie to everyone who has a good sense of humor! I am always a fan of Adam Sandler movies, and I think it was really cool that he didn't even have a part for himself in this one; it proves that he can make a really great film without using himself to make the movie funny. I liked seeing him use others to accomplish that. I'm also a fan of Linda Cardellini, for those of you who have seen Freaks and Geeks. Overall, it is a great movie, and it's nice to see something not so serious for once!",Grandma's Boy
201,jgibbs1891,boys boys boys,10,6 January 2006,"Guys seriously that was the funniest movie I've ever seen. i suggest u ""fish"" before you see it. trust me funniest movie ever. I mean the Frankenstein part is excellent. the guy who played in Dodgeball is hilarious. he is like a robot. no dudes seriously see this movie, u will not be disappointed. it says i need 10 lines so i gotta keep writing. he makes this sweet video game and the guy from Dodgeball tries to steal it. and the smoke a lot out of their bongs. Happy Madison productions make the best movies ever. this movie deserves 10 stars by far. see this movie you will laugh your ass off. Have a nice day. I'm CUMMIN I'm CUMMING!! Haha go see it",Grandma's Boy
202,junebug_925,Terrible Movie,1,15 January 2006,"I thought this movie was terrible. There were only about 2 parts where I really laughed. I groaned a lot, though. It wasn't funny, it was pathetic. I could tell the parts where they were trying to be funny, but it wasn't funny, and all it did was make me feel bad that their jokes weren't funny. I almost got up and walked out, and not during the middle of the movie--before it was even 5 minutes into it, but I decided to give it a chance. It ended up being and hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back. The plot is terrible. It pretty much involves people in their 30s sitting around getting high and playing video games. So much of it was predictable, and what wasn't predictable was just stupid. I was expecting it to be hilarious when I saw that it was an Adam Sandler movie, but I was extremely disappointed. Adam Sandler could've done so much better than ""Grandma's Boy.""",Grandma's Boy
203,EditorLA,Like too-old writers guessing what makes college kids laugh,1,24 March 2006,"I actually had high hopes for this film (no pun intended). American Pie was also righteously crude, but undeniably hilarious, even for the most prudish audiences. Sadly, watching Grandma's Boy was like seeing a marketer forcing out what he thinks college stoners will buy and find funny, based on other movies' successes. The bits have no comic timing; the payoffs for each joke are weak. Seeing the protag masturbate while dirty-talking to a video game character doll is funny for five seconds. By twenty seconds, it sounds like he wants to get the scene over with already. Worse, obvious jokes are actually explained by the characters, in case anyone missed them. No character is sympathetic, from the 36-year-old who loves eating Grandma's leftover wedding cake and scrambled eggs for dinner and still routinely says ""awesome,"" to the friend who inexplicably lives with his parents whom he calls ""roommates"" and sleeps in his childhood room with car-shaped bed. Develop the character first, and the bizarre home life revelation would be funny. Show us this character's home before we know who he is, and he's just lame.I used the fast-forward heavily on this one.",Grandma's Boy
204,keck-6,Do you have a brain cell? If so avoid this flick.,1,27 July 2008,"This movie is on the level with ""Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael"" for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen. If these guys weren't Adam Sandler's gay friends, this script would have ended up where it should have: as some big time movie exec's toilet paper. I hate this movie, it makes me want to injure people. I will admit that I have high standards, but honestly I'd rather watch Step Up 2. The ultra sad part was when I logged onto IMDb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. This is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick, fart, and weed jokes with little to no originality. After seeing this rating, I would like to suggest ""Tyler Perry's House of Pain"" to all of you guys who enjoyed this film; you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination.",Grandma's Boy
205,mikey_101101,Getting Old,7,12 January 2006,"i mean, the first couple of films that were made by Adam Sandler were Great. Now it seems that there making one movie after another without putting any effort into it.so, if you want to watch this movie, don't. you should rent it, or in fact rent another movie made by Adam Sandler. Its really all the same. but, this movie was okay. It was funny on occasion(could have been funnier though) it contained a very gross scene. This movie is somewhat similar to the summers Duece Bigalow European Gigalo. which was to short and stupid to even be released in theatres. so every movie they make is all the same. this movie will fail and then hopefully the filmmakers don't bother with any movie like this again",Grandma's Boy
206,I_am_Jacks,Great Movie,8,31 January 2007,"I don't understand why this move only has a 6.6 out of 10. It's a 10 out of 10 for what they wanted to accomplish. People give movies grades on what they wanted to see. If you go into this movie with the hopes of a fantastic plot and very in-depth characters while a stellar storyline unfolds then you shouldn't be allowed to watch movies. If you went to a Horror movie looking to see a romantic comedy (Shaun of the Dead aside) then again, you should rate movies.This movie was very funny, Doris Roberts, from Everybody Loves Raymond, was fantastic, and it helped that she was in it. This movie has many quotable lines and very hilarious situations that are there to make you laugh, and if they don't then your either too uptight or too old. Its a raunchy comedy about video games, partying, getting high and just having a good time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies with comedic value or someone looking for a film that will make them laugh. People looking for a ""black"" comedy might like it but don't go in with this whole attitude that will ruin your viewing experience.",Grandma's Boy
207,sasa_bainga,Not at all what I expected...,1,18 January 2006,"I must admit, seeing the trailer for this movie had me somewhat anxious to view the film. Viewing the film then made me want my money back. This film starts no where, goes nowhere, and is totally useless overall. If it weren't for it's OCCASIONAL funny moments, (occasional in the least sense of it's possible meaning) this film would deservedly earn the dreaded 1 on 10 rating. The rating remains so low because of the horrendous acting and unbelievably annoying characters. I convinced my friends to come see this movie with me, and now they won't trust me ever again (they told me that). Wait for this one on DVD if you absolutely must, and for those who go see it after reading this, well.....i can't wait to say I told you so.",Grandma's Boy
208,dpo77,Don't trust the critics!,9,7 January 2006,"First and foremost, I only gave this movie a 9 to out weigh all the 1s that morons are giving it, I believe that it truly deserves about a 6.5-7.0 (currently it has a 5.5 with 87 votes). Look this is a funny movie, it's not ground breaking and it is certainly low-brow but it's actually quite enjoyable. The critics are trying to make it into the worst movie of the new year, which is sad because, in my opinion, it's as funny as anything that came out last year, including wedding crashers (although wedding crashers, I'll admit is a better film). The story relies on comedy to get by, the plot bobs and weaves, sometimes awkwardly, in the name of telling a joke rather than flowing an interesting plot line, that said, I enjoy the filmmaker's willingness to disregard any attempt to make the story realistic or to make the transitions genuine. The flow of the story seems as if it is constructed in an alternate universe where random parties come together with ease, while it may sound as if I'm being sarcastic I'm certainly not, I believe that most movie transitions are simply labored and lame attempts to get from point A to point B, they just jump almost directly to what they want to do next in Grandma's Boy ala the first Wayne's World, which keeps the movie from sagging. All and all, I believe this is a great comedy, it's certainly not for those with high brow taste, remember, critics typically like comedies like Sideways and Broken Flowers, movies that, while entertaining, find it difficult to make a young person laugh. If you liked There's Something About Mary and previous Sandler films, with the exceptions of Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love, you will enjoy Grandma's Boy.",Grandma's Boy
209,mustangdaniel89,One of the greatest comedies,9,8 January 2006,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen! From start to finish it is very funny. If I could I would have went right back in and watched it again. Allen Covert, Dante, and Adam Sandler are some of the funniest actors today. I highly recommend people see this movie as soon as possible. I hope these 3 comedians continue to make movies for years to come. This will be remembered as one of the funniest movies of my generation. I can't wait to go back to the movies and watch it again. I will be waiting for it to come to DVD so I can buy it. If anyone has liked any of Adam Sandlers movies, they will love this one. It is nice to see these two star in a movie together. There is some good new comers in this also.",Grandma's Boy
210,therevengers,good movie,8,8 January 2006,"The movie is great movie. I thought this would be a movie that would be ""long line"" worthy but i was wrong. It would be for people who love watch people getting high and serious gamers. It may not be a comedy that would aim to everyone like ""Fun w/ Dick and Jane"" but it is a good movie. Since it is for certain kind of viewers i don't think this would a #1 theater success. I can't wait until it goes on DVD.If you a geek, gamer, stoner, this is the right movie for you. if your not go watch another movie. I rated this a 8 because J.P. is annoying and the remark about Filipino hookers, i may not be offended, but why did they need to say Filipino can't they say Asian hooker or just hooker?",Grandma's Boy
211,virginiamcevoy,From bad to worse.,1,8 January 2006,"Went with my husband; trailer very misleading. Amazed these three wonderful older female actors lowered themselves to do this film. Shame, shame Shirley. She must be really broke to have lowered herself to play this role. Will never be able to enjoy Oklahoma again! Guess we're from the wrong generation to appreciate this type of humor. It was so bad and degrading I was embarrassed to be in the theater or be seen by anyone I know. We should have gone to another movie in theater complex. We kept waiting for a plot - a real plot. Lord, I hope and pray that video games aren't really developed in this manner by these types of characters as portrayed in this movie.Do people actually live this way?? I realize it was a spoof and meant to be funny, however, it was just pathetic. Please, please don't let my grandchildren turn into one of these weirdo freaks! Sooo sorry we spent $27 for one bag of popcorn!",Grandma's Boy
212,bobloro,Worthless male syndrome,1,10 January 2006,"This seems to be just one more attempt by Hollywood to devalue men in our society. I for one am sick and tired of movies and the media portraying men as slackers and worthless characters having to be rescued by their grandma's, wives, or girlfriends. If the media picked on women this way they would be held up as narrow minded macho slobs, but once again we see that equality is not what the media seeks. The make fun of men because they'll take it and they deserve it mindset has to go. Keep it up and you will teach a whole generation of male children that it doesn't matter what you aspire to, because you have no value in our society and that it's okay to be worthless. You and your daughters are and will have to continue to live with the consequences.",Grandma's Boy
213,cindy-201,This film would have sucked had Sandler been in it,8,15 January 2006,"One of the funniest movies beginning to end that I've seen in a very  very long time. Allen Covert did a REMARKABLE job writing this film, and It's easy to see where Sandler really gets his material  from. Nick Swardson (Terry the gay male prostitute from Reno 911) was  absolutely hilarious. Linda Cardellini (ER) was great too... I don't  know how many women in the gaming industry are as cute as she is - but  - it was great to see her in something as funny as Grandma's Boy after  seeing her every week on ER for the last couple years. Having exposure  to gamers - a couple of whom are testers, I don't think this flick  could have been *much* more accurate. Overall - I LOVED this movie.  Start to finish it just got progressively funnier. GOOD JOB MR. COVERT!",Grandma's Boy
214,centuryfarm,"Not so bad, just don't go with high (haha) hopes",4,23 January 2006,"First of all, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, that said, I can't say that it was a ""good"" movie. I went into the theatre with pretty low expectations (something I've learned to do). I'm glad I did, because the plot and development wasn't stellar. The jokes were low-grade humor. But, I was in the right mindset to enjoy them.I wasn't the only one. In fact, the entire theatre was laughing out loud. I didn't hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close. I even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing! But again, I have to warn you, Grandma's Boy is NOT a top-quality film. It is a funny (albeit low-brow) movie, and if you go with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. Oh, and don't take kids to it.",Grandma's Boy
215,nrusso94533,Hilariious - A Gamer's Delight,10,24 January 2006,"This movie is the funniest I've seen in a long time. I'm a big fan of cinema but that doesn't mean i can't enjoy a classic stupid comedy like this one. The plot is lame its the side jokes that count. If you liked half-baked then you'll love this movie. The jokes come at odd angles and this movie is an instant quote classic. Dante ""Hey we'll go to the nut house together I don't give a f..."". The story is lame yes I can concede that fact. But Peter Dante gives the performance of his unremarkable career previously highlighted as the devil guy in ""Little Nicky"". A large amount of these jokes are understandable only within the context of the Gaming world. T-Shirt classics from the boys at Jinx.com - ""I hate this map"" will be totally lost on outsiders.",Grandma's Boy
