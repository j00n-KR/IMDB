0,SnoopyStyle,Dumb & Dumber meets The Hangover,6,16 November 2013,"Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) are two idiots who party too hard and must remember what happened last night. They have to find their car and their anniversary gifts for their girlfriends (Jennifer Garner, Marla Sokoloff).Sure it's stupid. It's so stupid. It's so very very stupid. That's the point. What makes this works is the two leads. Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott are both likable actors and they make a fun couple of friends. Although the script seems to be written by people who's had too much weed. It's still fun for sober folks. Although it'd help to have just a little. This from Danny Leiner who would bring us another stoner classic 'Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'.","Dude, Where's My Car"
1,gavin6942,A Special Kind of Stupid,6,2 January 2016,"Two potheads wake up after a night of partying and cannot remember where they parked their car.Some stupid humor works and some is just stupid. This tends to lean more towards working, though there are plenty of stupid moments that are just beyond belief. There are also a few crude sexual jokes that I could have done without, but I suppose that is the audience. (Do you regret this one, Jennifer Garner?) There should be no surprise that at one point this was a ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" script.The great cast and sporadic humor make this enjoyable. Not great, maybe not a classic. And if it is to be called a ""stoner comedy"" (which is a stretch), it would not even compare to the likes of ""Half Baked"".","Dude, Where's My Car"
2,lee_eisenberg,This proves that movies can be stupid and funny at the same time,5,25 November 2005,"My 5/10 rating is because, like any Bill & Ted movie, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is only targeted at a certain audience (in this case all the world's slackers). The plot - or whatever it is - of course has goof-ball stoners Jesse Montgomery III (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester Greenburg (Seann William Scott) searching for their car and having a most unusual adventure in the process. The point is that you shouldn't try to take this movie seriously; just accept it as nice stupid fun and you're sure to have a good time. Not a movie that you'll ever forget. If I remember right, Michael Moore even suggested that we should show it to Kim Jong Il in order to make peace between the two Koreas.","Dude, Where's My Car"
3,jboothmillard,"Dude, Where's My Car?",1,11 March 2005,"This has to be one of the stupidest comedies ever made, not even an amusing title or two well known stars can save it from being a waste of time. Basically pothead slackers Jesse (TV's Punk'd star Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (American Pie's Seann William Scott) wake up, and can't remember anything that happened the night before, and as they try to retrace their steps, including finding Jesse's car (like in the title), more and more people claiming to have seen them the night before show up. These include their twin girlfriends, Wanda (Jennifer Garner) and Wilma (Marla Sokoloff) reminding them of their anniversary (for a present), a dude dressed as a girl - Tania (Teressa Tunney) - demanding a suitcase of money, and some hot chicks, a cult and German guys looking for something called the Continum Transfunctioner. Other ridiculous events in the film include fridge and cupboards filled with pudding, a pot smoking dog, a drive-thru repeating ""and then"" (the only amusing moment), tattoos on their backs saying ""dude"" and ""sweet"", ostriches attacking, and in the end, the hot chicks turning into the Super Hot Giant Alien (Jodi Ann Paterson), and the Germans (who were the good guys all along, the cult were just nerds) giving them bracelets for the twins, that enlarge their breasts. Also starring Kristy Swanson as Christie Boner, David Herman as Nelson, Hal Sparks as Zoltan, Charlie O'Connell as Tommy, Fabio (who I recognised from Bo! in the USA) and Independence Day's Brent Spiner as Pierre. The jokes are rubbish, well, what are meant to be jokes, Kutcher and Scott can't even pass off for an alternative Bill and Ted, it is just a ridiculous film with no real point. Poor!","Dude, Where's My Car"
4,Quinoa1984,Definitely better than I expected,7,18 December 2000,"This film to me is like Dumb and Dumber with as teen mix.  It is complete dumb, silly fun and like most dumb, silly fun, I found it funny.  This film could've turned really dumb though and not turned funny, but it is.  The story (as smart as a cork) has 2 teens who need to find the one kids car (Ashton Kutcher as the one and the other one is Seann William Scott) with their girlfriend's and alien existence in the balance.  A funny comedy, one of the best ones of the year, even if there are a few flaws.  Favorite scene: a guy is working at a blind kids camp where he gets repeatedly hit in the genitals.  B+","Dude, Where's My Car"
5,wes-connors,"Dude, You Seriously Slipped Up!",3,12 October 2008,"Dimwitted, yet lovable Ashton Kutcher (as Jesse Montgomery III) and Seann William Scott (as Chester Greenburg) awaken from a night of partying, to discover the former's car is missing. They try to retrace their steps, and find their wheels, while being pursued by intergalactic aliens and a transsexual. This film is, as it states in the opining, based on ""actual events""; I recall many mornings trying to recall where the car was left. Not sure what the other ""actual events"" rooted in reality might include. Mr. Kutcher and Mr. Scott act stupid, not stoned; actually, only a dog gets wasted. There is a lot of silly sexual innuendo, but no sex. The leading men appear bare-chested; and, the women are tight, albeit fully clothed. The hit soundtrack highlight is Young MC's ""Bust A Move"". The movie looks like it was a lot more fun to make than it is to watch.*** Dude, Where's My Car? (2000) Danny Leiner ~ Ashton Kutcher, Seann William Scott, Jennifer Garner","Dude, Where's My Car"
6,sunwarrior13,Manages To Elicit Laughter,7,13 August 2013,"Dude, Where's My Car? is a comedy film about two young men who find themselves wasted and unable to remember where they parked their vehicle.It features Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott together with Kristy Swanson.It was directed by Danny Leiner.In the movie,Jesse and Chester are twenty-something stoners who wake up one morning and can't remember what happened the previous night. Now,they have to find that car before they're captured by a group of cultists who are convinced that the two morons have a device that will provide them with the means to travel beyond the solar system.In summary,the story is about the search of the said car. This is one film that was meant to provide laughs and to entertain.Nothing more.It does not intend to satisfy critics nor to provide a classic movie.And it succeeds.Although the humor capitalized on the film's stupidity,many will find it delightful to watch. Although Kutcher and Scott are first-rate comedians that will be comparable to the likes of Abbot and Costello or Jim Carrey,I still think that they manage to elicit laughter among the viewers.","Dude, Where's My Car"
7,bevo-13678,Outstanding,10,28 March 2020,"Every now and then a masterpiece like this comes along to restore your faith in the cinematic art. Truly a breath of fresh air from the derivative, brainless Hollywood trash we have become accustomed to. This movie contains spot on acting, sophisticated humour (the sweet/dude tattoo gag had me in stitches) and pin point direction. That plus a compelling story line, the likes we haven't seen since Weekend at Bernies, will make this film go down in history as one of the classics. BRAVO!!!","Dude, Where's My Car"
8,anaconda-40658,"Dude, Where's the Screenwriter?",2,10 March 2016,"Dude, Where's My Car? (2000): Dir: Danny Leiner / Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Seann William Scott, Marla Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Kristy Swanson: Very stupid comedy about unawareness, which in this case involves excessive boozing. Jesse and Chester wake up wasted and unable to remember what went on the night before. Obviously they didn't remember the part where they signed to be part of a stupid comedy. The story is a continuous chain of events where they encounter alien worshipers decked in bubble-wrap, a yard guarded by ostriches, transsexual seeking a briefcase, and a giant woman roaming through a fun house. What was director Danny Leiner attempting here? It is like several ingredients mixed together that doesn't work. There are interesting visual elements but the cast is a total washout. Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott play idiots trying to impress Marla Sokoloff and Jennifer Garner. You must be very intoxicated to be this drunk. Viewers will likely not sympathize with them let alone laugh, and Sokoloff and Garner are cast as two of the stupidest girls on the planet. To add to that they get mixed up with people and things that are about the same intelligence. Kristy Swanson also gets mixed up in this road kill piece of garbage. Extremely vulgar and pathetic script written by people who not only forgot where the car was, but were apparently under the influence of something terrible. Score: 2 / 10","Dude, Where's My Car"
9,StevePulaski,A candidate for one of the most suggestive and scared films in history,5,10 June 2011,"Quite a lot of punctuation in the title for a small minded and dopey stoner comedy like Dude, Where's My Car? which pairs the likable, but too toned down Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott as two buddies trying to piece together what happened the night before and answer the simple question ""dude, where's my car?"" The guys awake in their trashed apartment and realize that some event of uncertainty was conducted with their presence and they can't for the life of them figure it out.Soon it isn't long before they are subjected to a group of scientists questioning the whereabouts of a tool known as a ""Continuum Transfunctioner"" which has the ability to destroy the universe as we know it. The boys also must find their car to assure their twin girlfriends get their anniversary presents the boys bought and, in reward, they will give them their ""special treat."" The premise is ultimately way too goofy and far out to be enjoyable. I would've liked it more if we got more Kutcher/Scott screen time instead of flashing back and forth to the girlfriends, then the scientists, then the ""hot girls,"" then more scientists. I'm trying to figure out if this was a test of sanity amongst the audience or a test of fatigue.What bothers me the most is how the film suddenly wants to focus a lot on the crude and sexual humor, but then almost limits itself from it. For example, there are numerous scenes conducted on the fundamentals of women's bodies. We have a group of, maybe seven, women following the boys around trying to get answers. They come in dark black outfits and are beginning to say in some scenes ""let's show something."" We all know Kutcher and Scott can be far dirtier than this writing. Kutcher can be vulgar and sometimes over the top like his character Kelso on That 70's Show (and he's not playing too much different of a person in this movie) and Scott worked on American Pie as the foul-mouthed and crude Stifler. Why doesn't the film make these guys into way more realistic and way more cruder guys? I can't believe I'm saying this but if you're going to make a comedy, a stoner comedy, make the characters vulgar and not as one dimensional. Not to mention their over use of their annoying catchphrase.I thought for the first half an hour that Kutcher and Scott worked great as the ""unlikely heroes"" and came off as a live action Beavis and Butthead. However, the film gives them no dialog to work it and the whole movie is just one suggestive theme after another begging to go further than its PG-13 rating.Dude, Where's My Car? is a very one note comedy that doesn't really want to tap into anything more than an average late night watch. I don't think this is the type of movie meant for criticizing. Regular audiences, mainly teenagers, will find most of the humor ""hilarious."" Most adults will find it annoying and relentless. I'm the ladder category that found it to be only funny when Kutcher and Scott were on screen. The rest of the time I was just trying to keep in tune with the arbitrarily constructed science-fiction plot leaching onto the film. This is a film about piecing together what happened the night before. It isn't called Dude, Where Did You Leave that Totally Weird Space Thing? We Could Totally Use it Right Now! Also, the big question is never answer. And it isn't the title question. It's the second most asked question is the film - what the hell happened that night?...Starring: Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott. Directed by: Danny Leiner.","Dude, Where's My Car"
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Dude, where's my brain?",2,31 August 2007,"Now, Dude, Where's My Car became kind of a pop culture known fact, I have seen parodies on this movie and of course, no one will ever forget this title. But seeing how Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott had the lead roles, this was never a promising film. But still I think I wanted to check it out for myself. You know how you hear nothing but bad reviews on a film, but yet you just have to see for yourself how bad it really is? Well, that's what happened when I rented Dude, Where's My Car? But of course you know the saying: curiosity killed the cat? Well, curiosity killed my brain cells for a few moments. This is just such a ridiculous movie on so many levels where the acting is horrible and the story is just too silly.Jesse and Chester wake up from an apparently wild night from a party that their twin girlfriends threw, one problem, they don't remember a thing. When the girls promise them a surprise for their anniversary, but take it away due to Jesse and Chester's clear view on life as partiers, Jesse and Chester think as long as they give them gifts, they'll get laid. But the gifts are in the car, but one problem, where's the car? It's gone, they go on a quest to look for it, and end up finding out the strange situations they were in that whole night.Dude, Where's My Car is one of those brainless comedies that really had no point in being made, it was just a silly story and a waste of money. Just I know another good movie could have been made with this money. But in some sick way I think this is going to be a cult film down the line in a few more years. It's just a typical stoner flick, nothing special, not to mention it's actors are just not that promising. But we actually had some good cameos, and that's the reason for my kind rating.2/10","Dude, Where's My Car"
11,MovieAddict2016,"Dude, Where's My Brain?",6,4 December 2002,"Ashton Kutcher, of TV's ""That 70's Show"" and Sean William Scott of ""American Pie"" stature, have teamed together for what some would say a ""Bill and Ted"" comedy, but I would have to say a ""Dumb and Dumber"" trip in itself, without half the laughs. First off, let me say I think in a way, this film is underrated. What were people expecting, Citizen Kane? But then, we can compare it to other comedies, and we find ourselves wondering how a film like this could be made. It's a real hit or miss, and there are more misses than hits, but sometimes, just sometimes, there are some funny moments. At the scene with the blind child and the ""blind people handshake,"" I could detect some Farrelly brothers humor, and I would not be surprised if the writer(s) of this film were trying to take after their idols, Bobby and Peter Farrelly. However, this is not near as funny as Dumb and Dumber, and if you though that film was bad, you'll hate ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" It is in no way for those easily offended. I don't like when people say this is a rip-off of Bill and Ted. It actually isn't; ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" had many more laughs, and the main characters weren't high on pot the whole way through the film. I would have to give this mindless, wandering film 2/5 stars. It's not as bad as some say, and not as great as others speak of it.John Ulmer","Dude, Where's My Car"
12,cherold,"pretty funny, actually",7,9 April 2004,"In spite of the low rating here I figured I'd watch this, since I remember liking the trailer, and it's a funny, amiable, purposely dumb movie that, while not quite as funny as dumb movies Bill & Ted or Wayne's World is still quite amusing.  It's got a good idea in which two very dumb guys trying to reconstruct the previous drunken evening discover clues to increasingly bizarre incidents.  It's hit more than miss, and while it begins a bit slowly it gets up to speed reasonably fast.  What keeps it from being a great dumb movie is that the various elements introduced don't really build on each other.  Ideally each new revelation should have upped the wackiness level and felt like it had an insane sort of insane logic behind it, but it's more like you say, ah, that's a cute idea, without getting a sense of any real momentum.  The movie feels like a shaggy dog tale, but that's fine, I really enjoyed it.","Dude, Where's My Car"

14,lesleyharris30,"Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott Make a Funny Pair,But the Plot Is Just Too Stupid,",5,22 July 2013,"Dude,Where's My Car? is a mediocre movie with a very stupid storyline that is all over place and ends too quickly.I thought the movie would be similar to Harold and Kumar,the story sounds stupid but they make the best of it,that wasn't the case with this movie.I did think that Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott were very funny and clearly got on well with each other and they had me laughing a lot,especially the scene where their trying to tell each other what's written on their tattoos,but they just wern't enough to make up for the fact that the plot dosen't really go anywhere for about the first hour,and when it does its just ridiculous,and the several scenes in this movie that are a complete miss.There are some funny scenes,but I wouldn't recommend Dude Where's My Car? unless you are under thirteen because its just too ridiculous to really enjoy.Two potheads wake up from a night of partying and can't remember a thing.They have made a lot of mistakes the following night,but all they really care about is finding their car.","Dude, Where's My Car"
15,inkblot11,"Before the Hangover series, there was Dude; funny but crude",7,27 October 2017,"Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) are stoner roommates with a huge problem. Unhappily, they cannot remember what happened the night before and their sorry-state-of-a-car is gone. As they go through the day, they try to piece together what happened. First, they know there was a party at their twin girlfriends' (Jennifer Garner and Marla Sokoloff) house, something which has ticked off the gals mightily as the abode is trashed. J and C realize they must make it up to these ladies, as it is their anniversary and the girls have promised a ""sweet reward"" if they come bearing gifts. But, other events in their ""lost"" day include a trip to a strip club, a major theft of funds by the lads, an encounter with a weird group waiting for aliens, and more. In fact, the nutsy group believes Jesse and Chester have stolen a magic device from the aliens that they would like back. There are others trailing the dudes, very angry about matters the lads can't remember. Can these two airheads get things squared away with everyone and move on? Can they find their car? This funny but crude film will make some laugh, others cringe. But, in truth, the Hangover owes a huge debt to the basic premise of the movie; weird events go down when you are too ""out of it"" to know what you are doing. Kutcher and Scott are terrific as the intelligence-challenged dudes and the rest of the cast if great, too. The script delivers some bonafide guffaws while the direction is lively. If you want mindless entertainment, Dude certainly bestows it.","Dude, Where's My Car"
16,jacobjohntaylor1,Awful,1,23 September 2014,"This is not funny. It boring and stupid. At times it is gross. There good actors in it. This was a wast of there talent. Don't wast time and money on this movie. It is pooh pooh. Pooh pooh, pooh pooh, pooh, pooh pooh, pooh pooh. Don't see it don't see it don't see it don't see it. I imagine why people would laughing at this movie. Maybe people would and that is there business. But I am not someone who goes for cheap laughs. No I want to see something really funny. I only laughed a a little bit at one scene. Pretty actresses are no reason for me to see carp movie. I would rather take of big pooh then see this movie. Don't see this movie.","Dude, Where's My Car"
17,Floated2,Complete waste of time!,2,2 September 2010,"No insult to Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott, but these two couldn't carry a movie if it was strapped to their backs and weighed next-to-nothing (not a bad description of Dude, by the way). Secondly, Leiner, in a blatant attempt to get as many people into theaters as possible, whittled away at his R-rated subject matter until it achieved a PG-13 rating. As a result, not only is the final script of Dude lobotomized, but it has been emasculated as well. If those two things happened to a human being, he would be locked away in a quiet cell somewhere, not put on display in a multiplex for everyone to gawk at in stunned disbelief. The film is horribly unfunny, bad written and bad acted.In brief, the story - to the extent that there is one - goes something like this... Jesse (Ashton Kutcher, of TV's ""That '70s Show"") and Chester (Seann William Scott) are twenty-ish stoners who wake up one morning and can't remember what happened the previous night. And what a night it was - according to eyewitnesses, they were waving around money like they had it to burn, managed to get the sexy Christie Boner (Kristy Swanson) to take her top off, bought donuts for the entire police force, spent some time in a strip bar with a transsexual, trashed their girlfriends' house, and lost Jesse's car. Now, Jesse and Chester have to find that car before they're captured by a group of cultists who are convinced that the two morons have a device that will provide them with the means to travel beyond the solar system. In case you haven't guessed by now, Dude, Where's My Car? gets its title from the fact that (1) the two main characters spend the entire movie looking for the car, and (2) their vocabulary is limited to two words: ""dude"" and ""sweet"" (and Sweet, Where's My Car? lacks the same ring).","Dude, Where's My Car"
18,johnnyboyz,The stupidest funniest film I've ever seen. Notice how there's no comma between 'stupidest' and 'funniest'.,5,25 August 2007,"I was afraid, I so afraid that about twenty minutes into Dude, Where's My Car? I said to myself ""Oh God, this is the worst film I have ever seen."" Thankfully, it didn't end up like a Son of the Mask or a Thunderbirds and miraculously managed to turn my opinion around somewhat from 'the worst film ever' to 'an average, brainless comedy'.To have a film's title revolve around a funny quote the two dimwitted heroes of the piece state halfway through is a ludicrous enough proposition but what really follows is a singular line journey of events that range from the utterly bizarre to the totally random to the blatantly unfunny. Dude, Where's My Car? Is just a series of daft, unrealistic and meaningless events that make out to be connected in some way. The film is listed as a sci-fi but the film is so off the wall and random, including the scientifically fictitious events in this film just seem to blend in with any other happening and thus; make it believable that it could happen in this filmic world we're seeing.Some of the comic examples used early on to try and get us to laugh include: an exchange at some traffic lights between a romantically linked couple (a sort of 'we go, you go' game), an event at their girlfriend's house that results in all their hard work of clean up becoming undone and an exchange with a Chinese 'fooooood' takeaway order box. These particular events unfold in a pretty meaningless and random order and I'm sure that you'd probably find yourself in funnier situations if you went out with a group of friends during the day for a random drive as I didn't laugh at any of these scenes.There is one such scene in a strip club that is suspiciously open at lunch time hours where our two pothead heroes find themselves owing money to a transsexual stripper  although I laughed at this as soon as 'they' shouted 'where's my money?' in a rather masculine tone; it was because it took me by surprise more than anything else. It's here that a plot is becoming clear, that there is a back-story as to what happened last night and the film started to gain points with me instead of loose them. What follows after that is a further series of stupid, random events only this time I actually found myself engaging and maybe smirking now and again  suddenly we care because perhaps there is something at stake.From here, it becomes more and more apparent that the sci-fi trick is going to aid them in showing us these dumb events as each get more and more bizarre. The fact several leather clad ""hot chicks with big breasts"" appear whom change their deal from 'find us the device and we'll give you erotic pleasure' to 'find us the device and we'll give you oral pleasure' could be slated as being the most basic of basic mistakes made but with the feeling of something at stake, these random and often unfunny occurrences seem to be leading somewhere  a feeling I wasn't getting twenty minutes in. I found the film to be so ambiguous; I actually cared what would happen in the end.Dude, Where's My Car? will not be for everyone with some painfully unfunny and probably offensive to some material as well as some pretty shameless representations of Scandinavian, Chinese and French people; Dude, Where's My Car? let's its heroes get bullied about until they're right where it wants them and just lets random cause and effect situations play out  only recommended as a last resort.","Dude, Where's My Car"

It would not be so repugnant, had even one modicum of intelligence, wit, or creativity been employed herein, but unfortunately, such is not the case.

So they set off to find it, but get caught up in many misadventures along the way.

If people don't like this kind of stuff,why did they choose to watch it in the first place?Whatever this movie lacks in intelligence is compensated by the talent of its two stars:Seann William Scott is as entertaining as in American Pie and Road Trip,and as for Ashton Kutcher...Well,That 70's Show aside,he's never really managed to be this funny again. Those two guys know they're not doing a masterpiece such as Some Like It Hot, but they manage to make us giggle with the material they've been given. They know this movie will never appear in any Top 10 or 50 (except maybe Stupidest Movies Ever), and they're fine with that. And so should the audience.So,if you want to watch something that's funny but intelligent,watch a Woody Allen movie,or Wes Anderson's films,or The Simpsons,but if you want to watch something that just makes you laugh without having you focus on the story,I strongly recommend Dude,Where's My Car?.","Dude, Where's My Car"

If you ask me, Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) were very funny, even though they were potheads. In addition, all of their mishaps were hilarious. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy about two potheads. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

25,aidanratesmovies,Shibby!,8,29 June 2021,"One of the most brilliantly stupid films you'll ever see- Dude, Where's My Car? May be a little dated at times- but it sure is fun. I enjoy movies that know exactly what they are, and this film is certainly one of them. The film is so early 2000's it hurts, between its cinematography, costumes, actors, and music choices- you'll honestly think you have traveled back in time- a time far simpler- and in this case- far stupider. There is little to say about the film in terms of quality. Its plot is pretty straight forward and pretty ridiculous at times. Occasionally we will get a joke or stereotype that didn't age quite well- but for the most part its all in good fun- and given the themes at hand it could have been a whole lot worse. As stupid and even offensive as the film is though, you'll find yourself smiling with glee at how bizarrely entertaining this film is- largely thanks to director Danny Leiner- who also did another one of my favorite comedies- Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. It's a ridiculous film with a ridiculous plot and ridiculous performances, but it still manages to be ridiculously fun- and in the end, I think thats all that truly matters.My Rating: 8/10.","Dude, Where's My Car"
26,questl-18592,"Dude, WTF?",3,11 December 2020,"It had been a long time since I last saw this and honestly I never remember being super high on the movie but I thought it was a serviceable, dumb comedy. Wow have my tastes/standards changed. This was sooooooo stupid. I get that people in this are supposed to be dim but holy cow this got old quick. It's a series of bits slammed back to back all revolving around a pair of dumb as rocks, stoner-sequel guys and their absurd adventure. I feel like the biggest problem here might actually be the rating. Making this PG-13 feels like such a mistake because they clearly wanted to make certain jokes but then had to hedge them because the rating wouldn't let them go all in on it. If this was a rated R comedy that embraced the insanity and crudeness of the material there could have been some laughs but instead it's just this watered down, soggy mess that I want to toss into the nearest bin.Still, there are some chuckle worthy moments in here, it's just such a swing and a miss to have this be so neutered. Sadly, it's perfect for a TV movie, something to mostly ignore in the background and not pay too much attention to. But even then, it's so insane that if you're not paying attention and just happen to look over at any given moment, nothing will make sense. Not that it makes much sense regardless...","Dude, Where's My Car"

Instead we get ""Stiffler"" and that ""Puck'd"" guy trying to do comedy. Now ""Stiffler"" is simply incapable of being funny, but he is entertaining (when playing ""Stiffler"") because he is so irritating. Unfortunately in ""Dude"" his character is not ""Stiffler"". The ""Punk'd' guy is not funny but he is somewhat entertaining because you wonder how someone who should be working at the Topeka Dairy Queen is getting paid for this kind of stuff.Anyway the movie is incredibly stupid, but it is supposed to be incredibly stupid, and it is intended for a target audience of the incredibly stupid; maybe even less intelligent and discriminating than the folks P.T. Barnum was referring to when he said nobody went broke ""underestimating"" the intelligence of the American people. Its simple of mind target audience was illustrated at my local Blockbuster where the resident drones and wigger girls were laughing and snorting like pigs as they recounted their favorite scenes.For me the biggest laugh came from watching a then unknown Jennifer Garner (who was pushing 30-born April-1972) trying to play the uptight ""teenage"" girlfriend and keep up with Lisa Sokoloff (born Dec-1980 and the only cast member who is actually an acting talent) playing the other uptight teenage girlfriend. Seeing their talent disparity in light of their subsequent career paths was a graphic illustration of the entertainment anti-meritocracy. Although finding Kristy (Dec-1969) Swanson back playing teenage bit parts was some consolation.","Dude, Where's My Car"
32,Movie-ManDan,A Classic Stoner Movie For Almost Anyone!,10,8 March 2015,"The only problem with Dude, Where's My Car? is that it deals with dumb burnouts. Unlike The Hangover or Cheech & Chong, Dude has virtually no offensive material. Sure there are sexual and drug references, but it's nothing that a little kid in kindergarten or first grade couldn't handle. Just having good parents is good enough. Knowing the way parents are today, it might be a bad idea.Dude, Where's My Car? is a mystery-comedy that is always exciting. The humour helps the story and mystery portions and that's just fine. It is about two dumb and irresponsible best friends named Jesse and Chester (Kutcher, Scott) who wake up one morning after a wild party with their angry twin girlfriends (Garner, Skoloff) with no memory of what happened the night before and wondering where their car is. Their anniversary gifts are in it and they must also find the ""continuum-transfunctioner"" that holds the power to the universe. The future of the universe depends on them, and their car. When they are out looking for the car, they meet wild and zany characters that get them into hilarious messes. But what probably makes the movie as memorable as it is are its random scenes that are thrown in just for the heck of it. Many movies try to do thrown-in-humour and fail. Dude is the perfect example of thrown-in-humour working like a charm. The first scene with this kind of humour happens when they are ordering Chinese food with their friend (Herman) and teethe woman over the speaker keeps replying with ""And then?"" The next one happens when they are changing clothes and see tattoos on their backs that say ""DUDE"" and ""SWEET"" and they keep asking what their tattoo says but they aren't clear enough. There are many other hilarious scenes that are gut-busting with dynamite dialogue, but it is ultimately these two scenes that stand out in most people's minds.I have seen this movie so many times. I will see it so many more times. if this were released today, it would have received critical acclaim.4/4","Dude, Where's My Car"
33,Sandcooler,So where's your car dude?,6,16 February 2009,"This movie just doesn't really know what it wants to be, and it doesn't even seem to care as long as the profit's any good. It tries to have some kind of edge but they always have to cut back on the raunchyness very quickly because apparently they really had their heart set on a PG-13 rating. So you have these stoners, but of course we don't actually see them do drugs, and for all we know they're just regular morons, who are constantly getting into situations because they're stupid and possibly stoned. The script tries to stay dynamic by putting in a far-fetched plot with a cult and a lot of sci-fi material and it pretty much works. Things get so silly you can't really hate the thing anymore. The leads are pretty goddamn annoying, but some gags do manage to be pretty good somehow. The scene with the Chinese restaurant was funny, to name one. Still, pick a direction and go with it. If you're going to write a movie with these basic ideas, at least have the guts to put your money on an R-rating instead of pulling up the hand-brake and aiming it towards teenagers. It's not too bad though.","Dude, Where's My Car"

36,TheUnknown837-1,shockingly bad,3,12 December 2008,"There are some films that are so pitifully bad that they actually turn out to be fun. And Dude, Where's My Car is not one of them. This is one of those films that are so pitifully bad that it's atrocious and almost unwatchable. The target audience is, of course, adolescents and young adults, but even though I was an adolescent when I saw it, it didn't spark any enjoyment out of me, overstayed its welcome, and save for one two-minute scene, was a complete waste of my time.It features Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott, two fine actors who should have strayed away from this mess, as stoners who find themselves with a partial memory loss after a long night of partying and amongst not being able to remember where they parked their car, they forget another things and it just unfolds up unto the point where countless people including ""very hot chicks"" and science geeks are demanding to have some oh-so-powerful device called the continuum transfuctioner or something of the sort from them.I'm not going to bother listing examples of how bad this film is, I think the plot description I just listed does all of that for me. I'll just make this brief and warn you off by saying that except for one brief scene which had me roaring with laughter and actually starting to think that this movie might turn out alright, it's nothing but a waste of time.

37,IonicBreezeMachine,"Dude Where's My Car aims for slacker duo heights like Beavis & Buthead, Bill & Ted, or Cheech and Chong, but instead winds up barely above Meet the Deedles or Bio-Dome",4,28 June 2021,"Following a night of wild partying they can't remember, slacker/stoner duo Jesse (Aston Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) find they have misplaced their car and embark on search only to find that they've become entangled with extraterrestrial cults, stolen money, angry girlfriends, and other crazy shenanigans.Written by Philip Stark a staff writer on show's such as South Park and That 70's Show and starring up and coming comic actors Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott who'd proven immensely popular with scene stealing performances in That 70s show and American Pie, it's clear the film was banking upon their popularity to sell the movie. While the film was financially successful and its title has become ingrained in the cultural zeitgeist inspiring a number of ""Dude, Where's my____"" fake title jokes, there's a reason most people remember the title more than the actual movie itselfScott and Kutcher are aggressively irritating as the main characters Chester and Jesse playing personality free chuckleheads who for all intents and purposes may as well be the same character copied and pasted. For the most part they talk and act the same with little to distinguish themselves save for differing wardrobes. The movie is just a string of comic setpieces with our two chuckleheads ambling aimlessly from one setpiece to another with no sense of comic friction or urgency leading to a bunch of limp gags that just sit there with no punch or surprise. While not as bad as the worst of the slacker duo films like Meet the Deedles or Bio-Dome, it's in the shadow of superior films of a similar ilk.","Dude, Where's My Car"
38,blott2319-1,Substandard buddy idiot film,4,18 November 2020,"If we look at how many sequels were made as an indicator of success, I guess Dude, Where's My Car? would be considered one of the least successful buddy comedies about the adventure of two drug-addled idiots. Everyone from Cheech & Chong to Harold & Kumar have been revisited but Jesse & Chester seem to have faded into obscurity. I can't say I blame society for failing to latch onto this movie in a major way, because I found it mostly unfunny and dumb (and not ""dumb"" in an entertaining way.) I've seen enough movies and TV episodes about people who got so drunk, high, stoned, etc. to make it mildly annoying when I see it pop up nowadays. The characters are already starting at a deficit for me, because I don't appreciate that kind of moronic and irresponsible behavior, so it takes extra time to win me over so that I can root for them.Dude, Where's My Car? also pushes for a storyline that is overtly crazy, and it never worked for me. The entire story is improbable enough, but going into the realm of aliens and interdimensional gadgets was a level of insanity that I don't think the story had earned. I also didn't love how the entire movie objectifies and sexualizes all the women, and makes two of them the equivalent of trophies to be won. True, I can admit that the story was still entertaining to some degree, and I certainly wouldn't say I was bored by it. However, I wasn't buying into the plot, so most of the humor fell flat for me. I didn't have much love for Ashton Kutcher or Seann William Scott when I started watching this film, and I can't say that my opinion has changed. I suppose they were both believable as morons, so that's something. I don't think Dude, Where's My Car? was made for me, so I hope some people get more out of it than I do. While I didn't actively hate the film, it did nothing to interest me.","Dude, Where's My Car"
39,mattymatt4ever,"Dude, This is pretty funny!",6,12 April 2001,"First of all, if you were expecting to see an Oscar-winning spectacle--get the hell out of here and don't bother us with your comments.  This is no more than good, funny escapism for 90 minutes (almost).  Sure, some of the gags are just lame beyond belief.  And by the 45-minute mark, the film loses all direction and just meanders from scene to scene, without a plot in sight.  But this is not meant to be plot-driven, nor character-driven.  It's driven by its tongue-in-cheek humor aimed at a cult audience.  I don't expect this humor to appeal to everyone, especially if you're over the age of 25, but I thought it was pretty damn funny.  I was not only laughing at the gags, but laughing at the fact that...well...I was laughing at this stuff.  I went to see it with my friend Joey, and we were about the only ones cracking up (Well, there were only about 6 others in the theater).  We looked like a couple of stoners--just like Jessie and Chester.  We came in, with big anticipation.  We were mimicking the scene where the two guys had tatoos on their backs that said ""Dude"" and ""Sweet.""  ""Dude, Where's My Car"" is a ""Bill and Ted"" movie, with a little less intelligence.  Some movies cater to teenagers, but there is still a selected group of adults who are capable of enjoying it.  With this movie--it's STRICTLY for the teens and young adults.  So if you're looking for good laughs--not intelligent, satirical Woody-Allen type laughs--you will probably enjoy this mindless vehicle.  But as I said, THIS IS NOT FOR ALL AUDIENCES.  I'm sure some will regard this one of the worst films ever.  Personally, I prefer to knock movies that NOT supposed to be bad.  Movies with prestigious cast members that were simply overrated and over-blown.  But hey, it's your prerogative. But if you're some arthouse prude who prefers to watch ""Remains of the Day""--Dude, get off our backs!!!!!P.S.:  There's some really hot chicks in this movie.

40,Beta_Gallinger,"Stupidity can be hilarious, but it can also be, well, just plain stupid",4,5 August 2007,"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie on TV, but didn't see the movie until years later. By then, I had known all along that it was an extremely silly comedy, and that the main characters were two idiots, but to me, movies like that CAN be very funny, so I gave it a try. Around the beginning, it looked promising, but for the most part, I did not laugh, and may have been disgusted by some parts! I eventually tried watching it again, but didn't think much differently of it.Jesse Montgomery III and Chester Greenburg are two young stoners who go out partying one night, but when they wake up the following morning, they can't remember a thing about it! When they look outside, they discover that their car is missing, and they obviously can't remember what happened to it, so they go out to try and retrace their steps. Unfortunately, the missing car is only one of their problems! Last night, they trashed the house of their girlfriends, Wanda and Wilma, and don't have anniversary gifts for them, so Wanda and Wilma are obviously not pleased! In addition to that, a transsexual stripper demands that Jesse and Chester return her/his suitcase of stolen money! The two stoners even find the fate of the entire universe in their hands, and must find a device called the ""Continuum Transfunctioner""!There's a part early in the film where they go to the drive-thru of a Chinese restaurant, and when Jesse makes his order, he just keeps hearing ""and then?"" from the speaker box, even after he's finished making the order! That is probably the funniest moment in the movie, though the ""Dude, what does my tattoo say?"" ""Sweet!"" What about mine?"" ""Dude!"" What does mine say?"" ""Sweet! What about mine?"" joke is also a highlight. Apart from those two gags, there aren't too many notable ones. Some of the ""gags"" may even be close to terrible, such as the transsexual jokes, and the interaction the ""hot chick"" aliens have with a student at a school for the blind. It also seems that combining ""Dumb & Dumber"" with the sci-fi genre wasn't such a good idea.I get this slight feeling that maybe I'm being a little too harsh rating this movie less than a 5/10 (I'm not 100% sure), but I see no reason why I should give it a rating any higher than 5. Even if you like comedies about two idiots on a silly adventure, this movie could easily disappoint you, except maybe if you watched it while, let's say, under the influence. If you watch it while sober, the chances of you enjoying it may not be as slim as I might assume, but definitely not as good.

Well, the film's an hours of bathroom jokes, smutty humor, rude misbehaving, annoying stupidity and worse, an hour spent on seeing two idiots call each other by ""Dude"" and ""Sweet"". DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR is probably not the worst comedy ever, you could get yourself caught up in something worse, but that's only saying that this film deserves to be a candidate.Sean William Scott and Ashton Kutcher play two down-right dumb teenagers (even if one watches Animal Planet, doesn't make him educated) Jesse (Kutcher) and Chester (Scott). It all starts when they spent an entire night partying, and by morning, they forgot where they parked their car. ""Dude, where's my car?"", one of them asks. Then after-wards, the two are involved in a quest to find a device called the ""continum transfuctioner"", when they are sent by a bunch of sexy secret agents (who promise to give them the ""pleasure"" if they find it), as well as two male agents, either of which could be a horde of aliens who want it for their own evil cause.For a comedy, who needs a plot. But it is a crime to make a dumb sophomoric comedy that isn't funny, and DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR, although not totally unfunny, isn't a very enthusiastically funny comedy either. The movie is crammed with all possible jokes and humor in a teen comedy, it's rarely very funny. DUDE uses bathroom ans smut jokes of the bountiful order, but they're more gross than they are funny. In other words, avoid at all cost, unless you just want to know how the longest 83 minutes of your life would feel. Rating: 0 out of 5.","Dude, Where's My Car"

44,aesgaard41,Move Over Allison Hayes,6,9 July 2001,"SPOILERS INVOLVED? I guess I'm in the minority of people who actually liked this movie. I not a big fan of the idiot buddy pictures with Wayne and Ted, Bill and Garth, Dumb and Dumber, because they were all far more irritating than funny. Jesse and Chester aren't as annoying as they are inasmuch as they have a far too simple view of the world or seem to. Simply put, they seemed to be sharing a brain, but there's no idea as to who has most of it. This movie on the other hand does remind me a bit of the old ""Road To"" pictures with Hope and Crosby. Stricken with a Lost Weekend kind of phenomenon, the guys endure a scavenger-hunt like search for their misplaced car in a world without parents or morals. It almost seems like at one point the people along the way are taking their amnesia-like status for granted by making up all sorts of wierd events for them, the actual sequence of these events are yet to be determined. The search never gets really funny, but it never gets boring as they run into two different alien races, brain dead jocks, a self-taught guru, drag queens, their girlfriends, former Buffy Kristy Swanson and a Chinese take-out lady who is part stolen from Wayne's World and the Chinese episode of Seinfeld. They also run into Star Trek's Brent Spiner who is playing a hermit ostrich wrangler and a caged poacher who acts like Chris Elliott. My favorite scene is the giant woman sequence. Although too brief and too underplayed for fans like me of the genre, this is the sequence that really makes the movie for me and turns the movie from a braindead comedy into a more enjoyable fantasy. Doing her best Allison Hayes impression, Jodi Ann Paterson is a hoot to watch as she terrorizes what looks like a theme park. The movie is a long build up to this incredible point of view sequence. Paterson is augmented by excellant special effects, but it would have been a lot more interesting if the giant were played by a more recognized actress such as Kristy Swanson. I have to wonder if this was originally supposed to be a take-off on the Fifty Foot Woman movie, but someone combined the plot with a script about two buddies. As a whole, this movie almost deserves to be riffed by Mike and the Bots at MST3K, but it it is still interesting to watch by itself.","Dude, Where's My Car"

From dealing with aliens, their girlfriends, a cult and an annoying Chinese woman who only ask ""and then""?As dumb as this movie is, there're some memorable things such as the alien chicks. I found it funny how in one scene, a blind kid gropes their leader before being caught by one of the camp counselors (Jennifer Garner). There's one scene where the leader basically swallows Chester's popsicle whole.Their adventure leads them to a kids entertainment center similar to Chuck E.

It's one of those old timey ""daffy, zany comedies.""That genre is harder to produce than it may seem. Lots of genre wannabes and rip-off producers vainly attempt to stamp out yet another goofball slacker flick, only to emerge with dreck such as ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" or virtually any Chevy Chase movie.

He seems to have talent, yet perhaps his handlers have mislead him into stale and flaccid rip-off attempts of the original genius, he true and brilliant Eddie Murphy style of comedy. Whatever....""Dude,"" on the other hand, works brilliantly because the jokes all work. Mostly. From the beginning untill the end (and even into the credits), there is much to laugh about. Sure, a few of the set-ups don't work really well. For example, the arm getting stuck in the window scene, with the sadistic impound cop lady, was tedious. It ran on for 3 minutes too long, in my view. But MOST of the stuff was funny-- and as odd as this may sound, there were layers of humor, single, double, and triple entendre, and subtle side gags as well as the main screen slapstick.

Reason To Watch: · Loads of young talented actors, · Very stupid (after all you know it a stupid movie, why not make it extreme)Reason Not To: · If you like to analyzed, then forget it, · Talented Young actors turn bad, · Good plod turn really badRating: 4/10 (Grade: E+)------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- --------- --------- ----'Dude Where's My Car' -wait, what do you expected from Ashton Kutcher's movie. I think almost every people got the same answer for this guy - 'A really stupid movie'. Apart from 'That 70s' Shows' this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (He should thank the series for his reputation). 'Dude Where's My Car', is one of his trademark -'stupidity'. Somehow his film is even worst than Adam Sandler's movies, (can you imagine that). The movie is really non-sense, no story line, and no nothing. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W.Scoot should not have wasted their talent on this garbage. They even came up with 'Seriously, Dude Where's My Car'. This shows how the movie companies are dying of making money rather than quality.Max: 4/10Recommendation: Borrow it from your friends or just forget about it","Dude, Where's My Car"
50,Antagonisten,One of the worst,1,1 February 2005,"There is brain dead comedy, and then there is BRAINDEAD comedy. This is the latter of the two. Seldom have i seen something as unfunny as this movie. It's typical that it's about two stoners, because i genuinely believe that you have to be stoned to enjoy this.Both Seann William Scott and Ashton Kutcher are actors i expect nothing from. But this is a low point even for them. That the actors are completely lame and the story pathetic is not the biggest problem though. No, the biggest problem is that this is just NOT funny. Every joke they try to pull in this movie goes on forever. They repeat it until it has a snowballs chance in hell of being funny. Sitting through this is actually painful since you know you could have done something better with your time. Like staring into a wall. Or maybe drive against traffic on the freeway... Actually more or less everything is better than this.Seldom have i so strongly felt a movie deserves a 1/10-rating. This is truly one of the worst. Ever.","Dude, Where's My Car"

52,jts0405,A Pretty Funny Movie,6,22 September 2008,"Dude Where's My Car wasn't planned to win any Oscars and I didn't expect much of that from this movie. Ashton Kutcher is normally pretty funny on That 70's Show, so I expected a pretty humorous performance by him as well as Seann William Scott who had by this time already been in the first American Pie. All in all I have to say that this movie is definitely very funny and delivers a very nice and event amount of laughter. I wouldn't go out on a limb and call this the greatest comedy ever made and I wouldn't go out on a limb and tell a lot of people to check it out because most people think it is a stupid movie but if you really like a movie with a very dumb plot and lots of laughter, then check this out.","Dude, Where's My Car"

Actually, you don't watch this movie so much as you stare at it in disbelief.  Let me tell you a few of the plot points.  You've got two hot Swedish guys who are also aliens in charge of an enchanted Rubix Cube. You've got a musical number in the middle of the movie that parodies every rap video made during 1995.  You've got Evil Space-Babezilla.  And then you have the Evil Ostriches.Kumbayah, the Evil Ostriches.They've seen ""Jurassic Park"" one too many times.  They live in a zoo run by a Frenchman who keeps Andy Dick in a cage for some reason.  They are also holding our heros' car hostage.So, as you see, this is the most insanely stupid movie I've seen all year. I *really* wanted to hate it.  I really did.I did not hate this movie.I have regained sanity enough to give ""Dude"" three stars.  As demented as it is, it is NOT boring.

55,SonicStuart,Stupid+Funny= Stupid Funny!,10,27 May 2004,"Dude, Where's My Car?Starring: Ashton Kutcher, Sean William Scott, Jennifer Garner and Marla SokoloffGenre: ComedyRated: PG-13This movie had a bit of an unusual plot but it was still very funny! This crazy movie is about two bumbling stoners named Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Sean William Scott) who wake up one morning after partying last night and cannot remember where they parked their car which prompts them on a journey to find it and along the way, they encounter a variety of people who include their angry girlfriends Wilma (Marla Sokoloff) and Wanda (Jennifer Garner) whose house they trashed, an angry street gang, a transsexual stripper hounding them for a suitcase full of stolen money, a cult of alien seeking fanatics, and a group of aliens in human form looking for a mystical device that could save or destroy the world.My favorite part in the movie is when Jesse and Chester are going to get Chinese food and they are going thru the drive-thru and Jesse is ordering the food and the lady keeps saying ""and then"" and she keeps saying it after he was doing order and then he breaks the speaker box. My other favorite part was when Jesse and Chester got tattoos and they kept repeating what their tattoos say. Another funny part was when these two guys and these women are arguing over who is really trying to save the world and who isn't! After when I first watched this movie I couldn't even remember what I did (just kidding)! Hilarious overall.","Dude, Where's My Car"

The first one hour is rather empty and dull, nothing that seems funny anymore. The way the story is make similar to some other teen movie which i seen before. Probably the best way is to change the style and make it more effective.The performance is good and most of the casts have act very well but the comedy has out of the way, the humour has gone completely. This movie should be plan well. The final part are really exciting, this is excellent idea to give the monster a different look.","Dude, Where's My Car"
57,TheHande,A Master Piece in its own right.,8,13 December 2006,"Dude, Where's my car? is a film that doesn't attempt to be smart. This should be evident from the title. However, the film is so good at not trying to be smart it passes a point where it seizes to be an idiotic mess and becomes a master piece in its own right.The wide cast of characters keep the film's plot fresh and in spite of ridiculous plot-elements the film manages bust quite a few guts with its utter retardedness. The film's plot actually has a pretty smart setup, recovering from an amnesia is always exciting in a film, but the film is luckily not a one-joke film. The amount of variety makes most comedies seem very bland by comparison.The film is a brilliant no-brainer, but a nightmare for lovers of intelligent cinema.","Dude, Where's My Car"
58,theinaniloquent,"""After a night they can't remember, comes a day they can't forget""",2,8 April 2012,"Two potheads wake up from a night of partying and can't remember where they parked their car.Another stoner comedy. The movie lines with some potential actors, and a potential plot, but overall the movie TRIES and sometimes FORGETS to be funny... Now the film, again, had some potential and I had some expectations beforehand. The two lead actors have had some good roles, but then some bad roles, but I came with the expectation they would become a perfect pair for a stoner comedy. Wrong... The film's plot starts off wonderfully, and a little funny. Then the movie progresses into a sci-fi film. Again, the movie pretends to be what's not. It takes and uses what other films like this one had done, so expect it to be a little cliché as well. But the thing that really irked me was the fact the actors didn't care nor want to be even in the position. Their lines had potential and what not, they their delivery and execution were careless. They came to the film for money and that's that, the chemistry between the two were not even passable. They seemed stale as cardboard to me, and that's not comedy, that's attempt. The last thing I'd like to get at is how they used bits and pieces from other films. I'm not going into full detail, but Dude, Where's My Car didn't care for anything and ended up being yet another stupid preposterous attempt at creating a stoner comedy, albeit it's potential. I do not recommend the film at all, unless you can withstand the stupidity, or you can watch something a bit more clever and funny... Whatever floats your boat, but this film really isn't that funny. 2/10.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I like Animal House. I think Chevy Chase should have won an Oscar for ""Vacation"". But this is *unwatchable*, pure and simple.I only laughed once during the whole movie. Didn't bother to finish it, then changed my mind, watched the ending, and was tempted to burn the tape to avoid anybody renting it again.Seriously, save your money, rent a classic like ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", or go to sleep.

This movie is funny in every way, with Ashton Kutcher probably being the funniest guy throughout. But with certain jokes like ""Hello We're hot chicks"" thats more like 9.5 material not 4.7 - this is ridiculous. This movie had around 30 laughs and I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone to get some friends and have a night watching this awesome movie. It just keeps getting better with every viewing!. I own this movie have seen it like 7 times - one of my cousins has seen it loads more times and altogether my family has seen it, like... huge amounts of times - it's hard to count.

62,BigGuy,Surprising Comedy,6,18 December 2000,"This movie was quite enjoyable.  I was surprised by how much I laughed during this movie, and that it was never unbearable as is seen too often in comedies these days.  Some reviewers have compared this to Dumb and Dumber, I say that is a very poor comparison.  A far better match would be Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.  The two leads start as bumbling morons and end as bumbling morons.  But along the way they seem to learn a thing or two and have a brief shining moment, before going back to being slackers.  Another refreshing aspect is that there is very little gross-out humour or sex humour.This movie might not be for everyone though.  Some people will see it as stupid, without depth.  So if you desire a movie with depth, or are offended by occasion drug jokes (very tame actually), objectification of women (again rather tame) then you might want to stay away.  But most of the younger crowd will have a good time watching this movie.","Dude, Where's My Car"

Slightly raunchy humor, toilet humor, sex jokes, a pot smoking dog, aliens, nerds, hot chicks, and the attack of the 50 foot hot babe!I can see where critics slammed this movie...but one this people don't see to realize with this kind of movie...you have to check your brain at the door!  I can't fully watch this film from start to finish with your brain still intact.  What fun is that?  Chester and Jesse remind us of character like Bud and Doley (Bio-Dome) Bill and Ted (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure), and many other brain dead male duo's.  But this is okay...They really seem to have a serious friendship, and would die for the other!  Though, they are dim-witted and utterly metally retarded...they respect each other and are best friends...it shows in the performances! Kristy Swanson is totally wastes, however, in the silliness.  I don't even understand why she would have signed on for such a small part!  The other O'Connell brother is excellent as the jock bully!I mean, come on!  This movie is funny, silly, stupid, utter nonesense, hilarious and just a fantastic time for all.

65,tapio_hietamaki,Surreal comedy with a disappointing ending,7,29 November 2013,"This movie was effing crazy.The plot and the situations and the characters are completely surreal. The whole thing is like from some deranged dream induced by reading too many written assignments of 5-year-olds and abusing substances you shouldn't be abusing.I liked how the characters just looked at the stuff like, ""this isn't so weird that I should comment on its weirdness"". They don't make many movies like this. Everything is so realistic and believable now, even though the subject matter is totally crazy. This film was like a LucasArts adventure game where you do things not because they make sense but because of the surreal humor they provide.Unfortunately, as the plot elements come together, the absurdity turns into crackpot comedy revolving around jokes like ""big breasts are better than small breasts"" and ""Germans are gay"". The last half hour of the film is a disappointment.","Dude, Where's My Car"

Dude, Where's My Car? is well stylized with coherent usages of low techniques: an arbitrary story, amateurish acting, free camera movements like a home video piece (and this is in fact well done), an art direction with emphasis on tackiness, titles that appear to be made by an Adobe AfterEffects newbie, and so on. Oh, you can't forget showing your love for the B-grade cinema, as Leiner makes homage to Attack of the 50 Foot Woman in the film's climax.","Dude, Where's My Car"
70,KatMiss,GOOFY AND LIVELY,7,28 June 2001,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"" really surprised me. This is a goofy and lively comedy that made me laugh more than I expected to. Surprises like this are what make me love the movies.The film owes a debt to Cheech and Chong, the original pothead duo immortalized in a series of award-winning albums (Los Cochinos, 1973, which included the hilarious ""Pedro and Man at the Drive-In"" and the memorable ""Sergent Stedenko"") and films (the best of them is ""Up in Smoke"" made in 1978). I know a lot of people who are going to complain to me about supporting a film in bad taste. Well, it IS in bad taste. And while I have given bad reviews to ""Tomcats"" and ""Freddy Got Fingered"", those films were excrable in their treatment of women and mankind in general. ""Dude"" is good natured and funny.The filmmakers pack a lot of jokes into the brief 83 minute running time. But many of these jokes hit their intended targets so successfully. That is so rare these days. Another refeshing thing about the film is that it doesn't resort to the usual ""excremental humor"" so often found in today's youth films. Also, Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott make an effective comedy team. Material like this can go flat with the wrong casting. This casting is right.I'm not going to say anything about the plot because one of the film's pleasures is all of the nice surprises that pop up unexpectedly. It's great to see a comedy try so hard and succeed. Do see ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" today. You might be pleasantly surprised.***1/2 out of 4 stars","Dude, Where's My Car"

As it has been proved in many movies, setting up the joke is just as important as the payoff.In ""Dude, Where's My Car?"", many of the gags wore thin real fast and I guessed the final payoff 5 minutes after the flick started. I do confess that there were a few funny scenes and Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott do have some nice chemistry as the whacked-out duo. (I only checked the movie out for the title!) There were just not enough good gags to maintain the laughs through the film's 83 minute running time.","Dude, Where's My Car"

Not that I became his biggest fan after that movie, but I think the guy has some potential. Don't get me wrong, he will probably never win an Academy Award, but he possibly might give some other good comic performances in the future. Anyway, ""Dude, where is my car?"" is an enjoyable comedy and it deserves some more appreciation than the 4.7 rating it currently has.I loved the first part of the movie the most. I give 7 for the first part and 5 for the second part, because it wasn't that funny. The jokes where sometimes a little over top and the story became extremely stupid. Over all, this was a fun movie to watch. Not great but certainly watchable.Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott are an excellent on-screen duo.

I honestly can't believe this got made (or that I allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing).  The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be ""dumb-funny"", and the actors involved don't seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it.  Oddly enough, unlike most mindless slapstick comedies, this movie actually has TOO MUCH plot - every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot.  Of course, they were obviously going for moronic, but it doesn't work on any level whatsoever...There is only one aspect of this film I enjoyed: Donkeylips from the old Nickalodean show ""Salute Your Shorts"" has a very small role.

After I watched the movie I made out the fact that the critics were wrong, the film was worse then what they said.We have two dudes, Jesse and chester who just had a big night of partying but they don't remember what happened the night before when they woke up. They get a message for their girlfriends, the twins, and they talked about how their house is all trashed up thanks to them from the night before. Jesse says it'll be all right because they bought their girlfriends gifts. When they go outside to get the gifts in the car and go to the twins house they ask themselves a big question, Dude, Where's My Car? Together they must retrace their steps from the night before to find their car and patch up their relationships with only two clues, a fridge full of pudding and a match book from a local strip joint. They soon encounter hot alien chicks, a manly female stripper wanting a suitcase full of money, an annoying fast food lady, nerd alien hunters, wild ostriches, and hunky alien dudes to find their beloved car.When watching this movie I kept telling myself, this is a stoner flick. It's supposed to be stupid...well this film was beyond stupid. You have two idiots who retrace their steps from nothing because they were too wasted from the night before. This is the kind of movie where it had a good story but they made it too stupid even though it could of been a lot better. Sure you get a few laughs, a stoner dog, a crazed man in a cage, two dudes fighting over what the tattoos on their friends back says, and so on, and on, and repeats.

It's supposed to be quirky and stupid! It's a goofy stoner comedy. Seriously, what were you expecting? The moronic humor itself is what makes this film work and it's one of those movies where it's persistently hilarious.(""And then....."")The story is simple.

I like the strangeness and the off beat humor which still gives it a 6 of 10 and Seann William Scott is actually very much at home in this film.

84,h_wilson92,Loved it!,9,21 December 2008,"I love this movie.It is maybe in my top 3 funniest movies.This movie is about two guys losing their car.The plot is really funny and gets intensely funny as the movie progresses.I forgot how funny it actually was until I saw it for the first time in 5 years last night.Some of the funniest scenes was where they ordered Chinese food and broke the box after it went ""AND THEN!"",the dog smoking the weed,the scene where all these women ask for sexual favors and when these five women turn into the giant.It is a really funny movie and everyone I know has seen it.If you like comedies, this is a must see as it was the best comedy of 2000.My rating is 9 stars out of 10 cos it was great,funny and a true classic!","Dude, Where's My Car"
85,johanleupen,Pretty enjoyable after all...,7,16 June 2002,"Teen gross-out flicks like Dude Where's my Car are generally ripped to pieces by the leading names in American film-criticism, sometimes understandably so. But a critic cannot afford to put on airs when it comes to comedy. To attack the makers of this movie on account of plot-holes or lack of good taste is as pointless as criticising science fiction for lack of realism. People complaining that there is no sense to be made of Dude where's my Car (and there have been many) are pointing out the obvious: yes, it relies completely on gags, references to other films (Monty Python, Jurassic Park, Star Trek, Attack of the 50 ft. woman), gross-out effects and idiotic dialogue. Anyone intending to tie all of this material together into a well rounded whole with a message is in for a very unpleasant viewing. Expect a quick, youth oriented fix without pretensions and chances are you will enjoy this movie after all. There is no ground-breaking content here and Kutcher and Scott do not posses the comedic talents of Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey but they do inject a hint of charm into this picture, which is actually pretty enjoyable after all.","Dude, Where's My Car"
86,rsmolin,Surprisingly Excellent Film,8,8 April 2002,"Don't understand the low grades this film gets, as it will certainly become a classic comedy. It's funny from the beginning to the end, and while it has its share of slap-stick and sophomoric wit, it nonetheless stands out as a very clever movie. The music, sound effects, acting, and direction dovetail nicely. I thought it was a silly movie the first time I watched, but three more viewings has sold me on it. Try it again, and you will be surprised. No kidding! 8 out of 10. (And then...)","Dude, Where's My Car"

It might have been stupid, but it wasn't bad. It was still funny. This was never meant to be a good movie. It was made for one reason. For comedy. It did not fail at that. I thought that the story was actually kind of okay. The script isn't that good, but it's okay. The acting is average comedy acting. I thought that this was a very funny movie that is underrated and it definitely deserves more credit than it got. This movie was funny. It was bad, but funny. This was actually not even bad.

I am always saying, if you read my other reviews that Hollywood is always cranking out a teen movie a month and they are paint by number crap. Sure, this is no Brain surgery but I sat down with some friends and we laughed. The thing is, this is nor your typical teen comedy, it has some stoner guys, yeah, but they meet a lot of weird people on their way to find their car. Stoner Dogs, Alien Woman and Men and killer Ostriches.  If anything, I think it mocks the teen genre. I excepted it for what it was, fun and I had a good time.

91,Speechless,I just can't believe it,1,9 January 2001,"I can say without hesitation that Dude, Where's My Car is the most awful, unwatchable movie I've ever seen.  Hands down.DWMC operates at a level of stupidity rarely seen in any film.  Granted, the movie's stupidity is completely intentional--it's what the filmmakers wanted.  But it obviously never occurred to anyone that the stupidity should actually be *funny* in some way.  Stupidity alone does not a funny movie make.  It needs comic timing and balance to work, and DWMC is only interested in stupidity for stupidity's sake.  There is nothing else in the entire film.  It's just two hours of idiotic dialogue, unflinching sexism, and unfunny jokes that are repeated over and over again until you want to throw your soda at the screen.Also, the events of the story are too insane and random to work into any kind of whole.  Good comedies, even outlandish ones, nearly always take place in a reality with some kind of ground rules.  DWMC is set in a world where anything can happen, and it only hurts the film.  The screenplay tries incredibly hard to be unpredictable, throwing in more bizarre characters and situations every couple of minutes, and the film just ends up overloading our senses and boring us.  Every scene is arbitrary and meaningless and out of nowhere.  In a movie where anything can happen, what does it matter that anything does?No force on Earth could coerce me into seeing this film again.  I'd rather spend two hours holding a red-hot poker up my nose and eating dead spiders.","Dude, Where's My Car"
92,rastaban3,"Dude, why did I see this film?",1,15 November 2001,"What can I say.  This film was nothing but trash.  It had the basis for a good comedy but the story was wasted on jokes of very poor taste.  What really made this film bad, was that film seemed to make a joke out of people who had gotten so drunk they could not remember what happened. 
Overall, don't even rent!  (1 out of 10).","Dude, Where's My Car"
93,andynortonuk,"Director, Where are the Jokes?",1,19 January 2004,"To be honest, if a film's only highest is the gigantic hot woman, and seeing breasts enlarged by a device, you're probably watching something erotic. Well, no! You are in fact watching one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. From the start, it's not funny. In the middle, it's not funny, and with the ending highlights being those space women forming into a large, gigantic babe, with big breasts and a revealing skirt, and the hero's girl friends getting their breast enlarged, it's just not funny or clever! Even Repossessed tried to make it look funny to see a lady's enlarged while working until they exploded! None of these so-called jokes do not make me laugh, make me chuckle or even make me smile! The Jokes are irritating, frustrating for the die-hard comedy fan, and I was just hoping that the next job is going to be funny (which it never was)! This failed to get a single award, which I can say is the best thing about this film. It's a shame it didn't get any Razzies, which unfunny cinematic tripe truly deserves! Overall, this is dull, unfunny, and a waste of your time even watching it! I just hope before I die, I get 90 minutes left to live to compensate watching a truly dreadful comedy!","Dude, Where's My Car"
94,ElmStreetsLastBrat,Stupid? Yes. Funny? HELL YES!!,5,13 March 2007,"Dude, Where's My Car? from 2000 is one of my very favorite movies. I love stupid movies like this anyway, OK, SOME of them, and this one was/is an absolute treat. I love Seann William Scott and Ashton Kutcher and of course it's icing on the cake having those two in this film. This film is stupid, yes. But so funny!! This is one of the funniest stupid movies ever. I love it!! The plot basically focuses on two potheads, Jesse and Chester, played by Kutcher and Scott, who wake up one morning with no memory of the previous night's events. They're unable to find Jesse's car and basically go on a quest to find it. Which involves their twin girlfriends's trashed house, expensive gifts they don't' remember buying, such as cell phones, a car, and jumpsuits, a suitcase full of money that belongs to a transvestite stripper, and the need to find a device called the ""continum transfunctioner"". Sounds ridiculous? Of course it does!! All stupid movies like this have ridiculous plots. But I think that's what makes it so entertaining. The jokes don't fall flat in this film and some of the events that the guys are involved in are so funny that it'll bring tears to your eyes. Seann William Scott and Ashton Kutcher were perfect for this film. They're comedic abilities were right on cue. Of course this movie won't go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made but it certainly is one of the funniest pieces of mindless entertainment. I love this film dearly and it makes me laugh every time. This movie isn't for everyone and those who aren't fans of stupid movies like this shouldn't watch it. You'll definitely have something negative to say about it if you're not a fan. But I love Dude, Where's My Car? and I'm glad I have it in my collection. This film is so funny!! Thank you for reading my review!","Dude, Where's My Car"
95,stiv-7,Bill & Ted for the 21st Century,7,26 February 2001,"OK, so that's not entirely true; while no time travel is involved, this still fits into the same category as B&TEE. This is just a park-your-brain-at-the-door-and-enjoy type of film. Anyone expecting the brilliant shenanigans of a cerebral film such as Chicken Run (come on,people: they weren't even aimed at the same audience) will be sorely disappointed. The adventures of two pothead pizza delivery boys is not going to be on the same level, but the movie is what it is: good, DUMB, fun. The cameos are an absolute delight, and unlike a lot of abysmally awful films, the best jokes were NOT IN THE TRAILER. I really don't know why everyone is complaining about this one. I knew right after I saw the trailer that this was one to check out at the discount cinemas. Not that the quality is poor, but this is not the type of film you go see on opening night in a state-of-the-art theatre. Its humour will come through on any screen. See it with someone who will appreciate its stupidity. One more comment: And dennnnnn..........","Dude, Where's My Car"
96,phantopp,"Dude, where's the good laughs and plot?",2,7 September 2009,"""Jesse"" (Ashton Kutcher) and ""Chester"" (Seann William Scott) wake up after a night of partying so hard they don't remember anything. They can't even remember where ""Jesse"" put his car.Eventually, they discover that their adventures including taking a large sum of money from a transvestite stripper and trying to find extra-terrestrial technology. All the while, trying to get their twin girlfriends (Jennifer Garner, Marla Sokoloff) anniversary presents.Let me say first that this is a really stupid, predictable movie. However, there are a lot of chuckle-worthy gags throughout the movie.About 99% of the jokes, sight gags and oral, is completely predictable. They were mostly horribly set-up to the point that you see the joke coming seconds before it happens. The other 1% only produced a fairly good chuckle.Character development, for the most part, is poor. All the characters are one-dimensional. However, the development of ""Jesse"" and ""Chester"" were uniquely laid out as we get to learn about them through the film.The performances from the majority of the cast were pretty weak, mostly due to what they were given to work with in the script. I think that they knew they were given a horrible script and didn't put their all into it. It sounded to me like they were just repeating what was on the pages they were handed. If you ask me, Kutcher and Scott were the only ones that were believable in their roles.The supporting cast was one of the weakest I've ever seen. These characters were very cliché, and were pretty forgettable. There was no substance in them at all. They were either just there, or used to poorly advance the plot.Then there is the special effects. There are a few, and they aren't edited into scenes well at all. In fact, even though this movie is nearly a decade old, the special effects in the climax look as if they were two decades old, and didn't age well.The soundtrack is pretty forgettable as well. I don't remember any piece of music in the entire movie. Nor do I remember if any songs in the movie were either classic tunes or covers of popular songs.I would suggest that you skip this movie. Only see this on television if there is nothing else on and you are bored.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I just watched hangover which has a score of 8 and seems to be a complete rip-off of DWMC? Ever wake up with no memory of what you did last night? Only happened to me once, but then I lived through the sixties. Watch these two stoners try and work out what happened last night. A laugh a minute and a roller-coaster ride through the totally bizarre world of these unfortunates. Giants, aliens, hot babes and a weird alien worshipping cult. Jump aboard and travel the line between plausible and impossible. Totally recommended. Watch this and forget your troubles for a couple of hours!","Dude, Where's My Car"

AND that's not the best of it! They don't remember anything that happened last night! How funny! The whole movie these ""dudes"" traipse around looking for their car. And they end up in situations involving strippers, transvestites, and (amazingly) aliens. These ""adventures"" are insanely pathetic and insanely stupid. And (amazingly) they have girlfriends. Gee, guess what happened! That's right! They forgot their anniversary! AND! The presents are in the car, WHICH is lost! AND their girlfriends get mad at them, then they are pretty much forgotten about until about the end.The movies runs about 83 minutes. That seemed like 3 hours. Titanic seemed shorted than this movie. It is painfully unfunny. And I mean ""painfully"" in every sense of the word! The movie is surrounded around the words ""dude"" and ""sweet."" There's a painful scene in which the two have tattoos. One's says ""Dude"" and the other one says, you guess it, ""Sweet."" They batter back and forth for three minutes. ""Dude, what's mine say?"" ""Sweet, what about mine?"" ""Dude, what's mine say"" and so on for three minutes which seems like fifteen.The girlfriends are about the only two characters worth paying attention to. And even they aren't funny. But the two ""dudes"" are so stupid. Their stupidness leads them into even stupider places... which leads into even more STUPIDER situations. Thinking back to the tattoo scene again. Oh! AND! Did I mention the scene about the Chinese food? The person the drive up says ""And then..."" after everything and the movie expects that to be funny. But, guess what, it's not! At all! It's not even remotely funny! There is one, count 'em, one funny scene. That scene involves a blind kid. And laughing at that makes me feel bad. But, there is one, count 'em, one funny character. He's a stupid police officer named Rick. The movie would have been hilarious if it was about him! But, unfortunately, he's only in five minutes.The jokes... *sigh*... the jokes. Every joke in this movie has been stolen from another movie. For example, there's a character that just shows up and never talk, a la ""Half Baked."" There are sexual jokes beyond belief for a PG-13 rated movie. The movie doesn't have much swearing but it piles sexual jokes on top of you. When I saw this movie, many people in the theater were laughing. May God have mercy on their souls. And the souls of everyone in this movie and the creators. Except for the guy who played Rick! Rick: We hardly knew ye.","Dude, Where's My Car"

In fact one of my favorite films is RUN RONNIE RUN, however - this film doesn't even come close to the brilliance of David Cross and Bob Odenkirk.The worse thing about a film like Dude, Where's my Car, is realizing that it had the potential to be quite a good film - IF IT HAD A PLOT. Recounting a drunken night of two annoying adolescent youths COULD have been FUNNY! With a little more characterization and a bit more of a believable plot line.This film is patronizing young people! Chicks are all bikini wearing hotties and guys are all muscle frat boys who drink too much. It's the typical 'teen comedy' - but it's even patronizing to teenagers. Also, even if you were wasted - I reckon you'd REMEMBER getting a f*c*i*g tattoo!! (err, and it would be red and sore the next day!!) They didn't have to make it 100% realistic, I realize that - BUT Run Ronnie Run is ridiculously unrealistic, BUT THE CHARACTERS WERE DIFFERENT AND FUNNY!!

If you're looking for a pair of goofy guys, who are trying to determine what they did the night before, then this is your movie.  They're kind of like the ""Bill & Ted"" of the new millennium.Overall, it was a fun movie with adolescent hijinks, although it does not deliver the laughs one of the ""Scary Movie"" movies would.

102,happytoms,Just watch this 2000s classic with an open mind and you will be fine,6,12 November 2019,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and I kinda remembered parts of but I kept procrastinating watching it again now because I kinda liked it when I was younger. So finally came the day I finally decided to watch it and I must say even after all these years it's enjoyable. Not the best or worst but enjoable enough.I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie.The story. ( Easy to watch, funny, iconic and remeberable in some parts but not all.
It's set in the beautiful state of California where we are introduced to a wide selection of different characters over the course of the movie but this story is mainly focusing on 2 stoner bestfriends who keep being bad boyfriends, bad employess and keep ending up in trouble. Sometimes their intentions are good but even in those times they keep messing up. And of course everything no matter how bad it gets has a way to be resolved in the end after all. I don't mind it.
This is a comedy so there are quite a lot comedic and iconic early 2000s moments. I enjoyed some of them but not all of them and it's okay. At first I didn't liked few things about it but watching it with an open mind later on made me thinking who cares. It's just more of everything.
Personally I enjoyed this movie much more than few other early 2000s movies who tried to be funny but failed miserably. It doesn't work everytime. And it almost didn't worked in those one. But I still like it. Kinda.Sound design - (Meh. I'm writing this review few hours after I watched the movie and looking back I don't think I remember that much of the sound design. Nothing really stood out to me besides maybe à few songs but nothing too great to remember.)Overall I think quite a lot of people will not enjoy it and quite a lot will. In this case this is a 50/50 movie. Where 50% people like it and the rest don't.
Personally, after watching it this feels like not the greatest movie and not the worst one so it's somewhere in the middle around 6 out of 10.
Wouldn't really recommend to anyone and it wouldn't be one of my first choices from the comedy genre.","Dude, Where's My Car"
103,PenOutOfTime,bad comedy,3,19 May 2007,"Stoner comedies are not exactly notorious for cleverness, and indeed they are specifically about stupid characters, but this one is striking not for the stupidity or silliness of the characters, but rather for the lack of cleverness, indeed stupidity, and blatant lack of humor BEHIND the film, and going into its creation.This is not a funny film, not really because of bad acting, but because of bad writing and lack of comic skill in the creators. The weak humor is emphasized by a contrived plot, and further highlighted by a banal, conventional, and conventional ethos underlying everything.

108,the-jerk,much better than you'd think,9,14 April 2005,"People who saw ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" either loved it or hated it. What you thought of it probably depended on your impression of the movie beforehand. If you're a fan of ""Cheech and Chong""-style stoner movies, and you're a gen-xer or younger, you probably enjoyed it. If you knew it was going to be stupid and expected little, you probably didn't like it.I thought it was an excellent movie. I know not many serious people felt that way, but there you go. I like a movie that is self-consciously stupid, and I felt that this one pushed that concept to the limits. Everything seemed to be done to give the impression to the uninitiated that this was a bad movie. The writing on the surface seems terrible; the acting on the surface seems terrible. And I'm not going to say you have to look deep to find meaning. The deeper you look, the less meaningful the movie becomes. The filmmakers are working from a long tradition here. Give Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott some credit; they are both gifted comic actors, and they are both funny here. The movie doesn't make much sense, even when we find out what the continuum transfunctioner is. The bare-bones plot seems like nothing but an excuse to have these two half-wits go on a series of misadventures. And yet, I don't think it can be denied that these vignettes are funny, often hilarious. And the dialogue is so stupid that it's really hilarious as well. Consider:CHESTER: Dude, you just touched Christy Boner's hoo-hoo. JESSE: Shibby!MR PIZZACOLI: A trained dolphin could deliver pizza better than you too. JESSE: But then the pizzas would get all wet!And so on. The movie is full of non sequiturs and dumb dialogue. And if you're in the right frame of mind (and no, I don't mean high) then much of this is hilarious. The fight with the Chinese food takeout lady (""And then?"" ""No and then!"" ""And then?"" ""I refuse to play your Chinese food mind games!""); the guy in the cage (played memorably by Andy Dick); the transsexual stripper (or, as he/she puts it, ""gender-challenged male""); the race of identical hot chicks, and their enemies, the ""totally gay Nordic dudes""; the cult of Zoltan; and, of course, the continuum transfuctioner itself, which is a Rubiks cube that Chester is able to solve, despite barely having the brainpower to tie his own shoes. This is all very funny, and I think you have to be some kind of film snob to not see the artistry that went into making a movie so stupid that ends up being so entertaining.What you have is the most likely future cult classic to come out in many a year. It's a stoner movie where nobody (human) does any drugs; a mystery with no real mystery; and a dumb movie that, because of the calculatedness of its lunacy, is not really so dumb after all.","Dude, Where's My Car"

And I'm sure some sleazy executive in Hollywood thought ""Wow what a hip title, it will attract all the young people!"".  WRONG.  Well my friends suffered with me.  Well we ALL suffered.  It was a terrible ""film"".  Not one of us laughed at this stupid junior high school level film. Stupid, stupid, STUPID.  I did get to say ""I told you guys"".Its not even stupid in a good way, but in a bad, bad, BAD way.  Avoid this movie at all costs.  This is the type of dirt bag film where the producers should have just taken the budget and donated it to charity.  At least something good could have come out of it.","Dude, Where's My Car"
113,MartPol,Shockingly bad,1,23 March 2002,"That this film was ever made must seem to its makers somewhat astonishing - to a person who just spent £3 renting it (stupid me) it's an outrage. By far the least funny comedy to have ever sullied the world of cinema, it lurches appallingly from send-up to shock comedy to laugh-free stoner antics at the drop of a hat.A film that raises two wry grins throughout its course: one of which is a moment recycled from There's Something About Mary (a stoned dog! How we laugh!) and another that makes you reminisce for the days of Bill and Ted and Wayne's World - which is just about all the film does, in fact.Abysmal.","Dude, Where's My Car"
114,yduric,Bad and definitely not funny,1,17 October 2006,"What I think is that this extremely tasteless movie tries to do, with the use of bad taste and the piling of clichés upon clichés combined with a plot totally lacking credibility, to push in the direction of a 'funny bad movie'but ultimately fails to provoke the desired effect. Or, to explain this a little bit better: instead of making fun of EVERY character in the movie, it seems to deliberately spare the two main characters, which are, in my opinion, quite obnoxious, and even tries to arouse a certain sympathy for them, while at the same time, it ridicules everything and everybody surrounding them, to such a degree that it even becomes quite offensive, and it is there that the failure lies, because, in order to make a 'funny bad movie'(in my opinion) the necessary condition is that EVERYTHING and EVERYONE, including the lead characters be ridiculed, and it is obviously not the case here, suggesting that some categories of people can be freely ridiculed without any restriction and others not. The conclusion emerging from that can be summarized in one word: DISCRIMINATION","Dude, Where's My Car"

Its a comedy with its sole purpose to be a comedy.I'd even go as far as say its a good one for the family.  The sexual jokes may be more appropriate for the older kids, but there's nothing graphic, drugs are not glamourized (and while central to the plot, aren't a big part of the on-screen presentation), and its simply a fun movie.Don't go in expecting much, and you'll come out enjoying this flick.

As many people have pointed out, IMDb is becoming less reliable. Yes, this comedy is ""stupid"" (I don't actually like the way people on here use this adjective to describe the movie - too many negative connotations), or, as I like to put it, it is so light hearted it isn't supposed to be taken seriously at all. The plot simply proves it. But it is the ridiulousness of the plot and the fact that this would never happen to anyone in real life that make this move insanely funny. I mean, who didn't laugh at ""Dude, it's a llama!"", the ""And then"" scene, or ""My name is Zarnoff. This is Zabu, Zellnor, Zelbor, Zelmina, and, uh, Jeff.""? The movie is hilarious all the way through, there aren't any scenes that won't cause the watcher to stop laughing. If anyone wants to watch a real comedy movie, which does it's job of providing comedic entertainment, then ""Dude, where's my car?"" is the movie to watch. Although judging by the fact that people these days prefer to claim that Zach Galifianakis doing his typical ""Look at me, im fat, therefore im funny!"" is absolutely hilarious, this movie won't get the deserved rating and recognition, simply because people have a boring sense of humour.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I will point out that none of them were titled ""Dude Where's My Car"" I can understand why people might think this movie is terrible. It is extremely stupid. But this movie does not aim for intelligence, so why should it be judged in that fashion? Rather this movie hits all the bases it needs to: drug references, pop-culture references, women reduced to body parts (and the men made fun of for doing it)...in fact nary a movie has come out that has been a better parody of the male gaze.

118,Elori,"Dude, awesome!",8,15 December 2004,"I went into Dude, Where's my Car expecting an idiot teen comedy, with many reviews criticizing the movie of focusing to lowbrow humor. Instead I found what could be a spiritual successor to Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. DWMC doesn't focus on shock value and bathroom humor like Austin Powers for example, instead it provides a constantly moving flow of absurd situation comedy. The viewer has no idea what to expect next, which provides a truly refreshing movie experience in this age of treadmill plot lines and run-through situation development. You have to keep your wits about to catch many of the subtler jokes, while the recurring themes keep making you laugh throughout the movie. The characters and their lines are absolutely spot on, and while the movie starts a bit slow, it's quick to start going and only gets better as it proceeds.

It is certain that there will be comparisons to films such as ""American Pie"" and ""Road Trip"" but they are both well ahead of this, highly unoriginal and, frankly, dull ""pothead"" film. It is possible to say that the two leading men could make a very good comedy two-some if given the right material but they should steer clear of stuff like this in future. I am happy to accept that this is a film for the American sense of humour but maybe it should have stayed over there.

And then we'll have sex!""The whole idea is really stupid and not at all funny.The makers have tried to make a teen movie in the American pie mould but have also tried to include cartoonish innocence in the characters, which totally doesn't work.And the jokes are lame.

I just watched it and thought it was really funny... very stupid, but funny. The thing that can sink this type of stoned, suburban, Jeff Spicoli style movie, is if it starts going into places where it doesn't belong. Like getting too serious, or introducing a different type of humor. ""Dude, Where's My Car"" sticks to its aesthetics -- stupid as they are -- throughout, and never sells itself out. Therefore I think it works, and is in fact a well-made teenage comedy. I think this will only appeal to a very specific audience, but you can say the same thing about a Kieslowski movie.So... if Jeff Spicoli, Bluto & Stifler are your heroes, you're going to enjoy this movie a lot.

133,LinaInverse23,A STUNNING EPIC MASTERPIECE!!!,1,19 November 2002,"Dude Where's My Car is a captivating satire on what we like to call society. All of us Americans rely to heavily on materials to make us feel better or to make us forget things.  This prevents us from learning the important things in life portrayed in Dude Where's My Car.  Sean William Scott proves time and time again that a picture is worth a thousand words.  Sean steals the movie as a torn teenager from a society filled with baby boomers refusing to leave the upper offices.  Sean struggles hard to remember where the car is which is a huge symbol throughout the movie.  The car is in fact their ""want"" to do the best they can in life and to forget all the bad times and build upon those to improve their lives.  Searching for their car is half the journey towards individualism and speaking out for freedom.  I know Americans would love to feel free to do what they want and Dude Where's My Car is trying to teach us that.  Forget all the materials we possess because the after all it is not the materials that make us, we make ourselves.

Having seen it quite a few times since (my kids watch it over and over) I now find most of the movie to be quite amusing. Yes the film is stupid, but deliberately so. Giving this film a bad review must mean you lack a sense of humor. No wonder it's developed a cult following. I can just imagine how much fun the actors and crew had making it.

Seriously, this movie should have come with a surgeon general inspired label and warned the viewers of its potential effects.""Dude, Where's My Car?"" was beyond dumb, stupid, mindless and all other synonymous derogations. Some people argue, ""Yeah, but that was the point."" I disagree. Dumb, does not have to be this dumb. Think ""Wayne's World"" and ""Ace Ventura"" or even ""Dumb and Dumber"". These movies were intended to utilize base/obvious humour but they employed a certain amount of wit -- a wit that was shamefully lacking in D.W.M.C.In defense of the movie, the casting was superb. I don't think the agents could have found two males more capable of playing dullards as convincingly as Kutcher and Scott.I wouldn't even try to look for a plot in this movie.

All of that being said, I thought ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" was hilarious.There is a very big difference between this movie and things like ""Joe Dirt"" (which is rented way too often for me to still believe in human intelligence).  The difference is that ""Dude, Where's My Car"" knows full well that it's stupid.  Most bad comedies like to masquerade as an actual film, but this one was written with the mentality of creating the absolute stupidest movie ever created.  It takes intelligence to be this amazingly dumb and, by virtue of new levels of moronic entertainment, original.There are numerous jokes about drugs (which occasionally wore on me), lots of jokes about the female anatomy, and the two idiots to end all idiots. On my first watching the initial twenty minutes were painful, but it was all so ridiculous and stupid that I couldn't help but laugh.  This isn't ""Annie Hall"" or Monty Python, and it knows it.

The most laughable cast of stock characters in recent memory (closely rivaled by the fast and the furious).Avoid this film at all costs. I would have walked out of it in the theatre but I felt as though I was witnessing a historic failure of filmmaking I couldn't possibly ignore. This movie is a gut-check for American cinema and proof positive that society is on the brink of collapse. The next flood can't be too far away. Give me 'battlefield earth' any day over this pathetic piece of crap.","Dude, Where's My Car"
155,devon_chris,Neatish experiment that doesn't quite hit the spot,5,6 September 2002,"First things first - who is this film aimed at? I'd say fans of Porky's, Animal House and American Pie (a veteran of which plays Chester here) looking for the same kind of testosterone-happy, slobbish teen humour. And the film doesn't quite pull it off. That doesn't mean to say it's a bad piece. The sheer ludicrous nature of the comedy makes it cheerful and refreshing, and the disingenuous leads make for some madcap foolishness that mixes American teen comedy with elements of old-style black-and-white farce - the 'taking out the rubbish' scene with the dropped bottle top does this beautifully. There is also a touch of the detatched, Austin Powers style, and anyone who liked Mike Myers' work would probably get most out of 'Dude, Where's My Car?'. Like I said, though, it doesn't quite make the grade of 'Porky's', etc, for a few reasons. The calamitous side of the film doesn't quite come off because of our lack of interest in the characters. In 'American Pie', for example, there is an agonising build-up to each of Biggs' misfortunes which the audience are really sucked into. Chester and Jesse in 'Dude', though, are not built up as individuals in the slightest. Now you may say quite rightly that this is hardly the film that needs deep depictions of the thought process of each character, but making the parts completely two-dimensional is a mistake. The set-piece gags still work, but for the film as a whole to be engaging and slick, not only does it need a more flowing, dynamic script, but we need to have just that tiny iota of character detail to keep us truly entertained as well as simply content, even if it is totally puerile stuff we're looking for in general. And about that script. Again, some of the set-pieces are great, and it's a matter of fact that the script's not predictable in the slightest, but it still alienates occasionally. The 'and then' Chinese restuarant and the 'Dude/Sweet' tattoo scenes just wound me up. Comedy of this sort needs to be more quickfire, and not fall into the Austin Powers trap of laughing at its own jokes, as this film seems to do too often. Basically, this film aims for a niche audience, and doesn't hit it. The movie doesn't have drama, tension, depth or anything remotely sophisticated, but that doesn't matter in itself - what matters is that 'Dude, Where's My Car?' is just that tiny bit too shallow, too indifferent and too insipid to provide the laugh-fest that a premise like this (and it is a very nifty idea for a film) should produce. Of course, this doesn't make it unwatchable. If you want something to engage you, don't watch it. If you want some really great comedy, don't watch it. If you disapprove of the smutty filth that's on TV today, don't watch it (and also get a life). If you want something deep and meaningful, don't watch it. If you've got a brain cell dying to be used, don't watch it. Watch it if you've got a pizza to eat and some beer to drink, most of which you will later fling around the room like the free spirit you are. Above all, watch it without any great expectations, just being prepared to take the laughs as it comes. Not a bad shot from the interesting work-out-what-happened-as-you-go angle. Guaranteed to entertain people whose parents wouldn't approve of them seeing it, and also anyone who likes stoner jokes.","Dude, Where's My Car"

157,dupamiaza,In 2000 I thought it was the worst film ever,5,19 January 2019,"In 2000, when I saw this movie, I thought it was the worst film ever. I literally felt that you can't get worse than this. A friend wanted to see it too and I told her: ""Dude, the film is really bad"". She watched it anyways and, after seeing it, she came to me and told me, laughing: ""Dude, you were right. This is really bad"".
Although I felt it was stupid, it still somehow managed to slightly entertain me. It was watchable. It's been almost 20 years now. Meanwhile, I've seen so many many other really bad, un-watchable movies. So, what do you know. This bad movie wasn't the worst movie at all.
In fact, as some other people also pointed out, it was somewhat entertaining.
So I give it 5 stars, because it is a mediocre movie.
I hope that 20 years in the future I won't think this movie was actually good comparing to the movies that will exist in 2040.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I feel a little guilty to pass judgement on this piece of crap because I couldn't force myself to watch it in its entirety. Believe me, after 10 minutes I kept on watching only because being the perennial optimist I am I hoped it would improve. As it got progressively worse I realized this horrendous flick had indeed the potential of making number one on my list of worst films ever. With a conscious masochistic attitude I forced myself to watch an additional 30 minutes. The pain, mixed with atrocious boredom, became so bad I finally had to give up and quit watching... But, unfortunately for me, I had watched more than enough. It is my contention that you have to be almost brain dead to enjoy anything about this unfunny, uninteresting, poorly written, acted and shot piece of garbage. If you have a couple of braincells left....you will most definitely kill them if you insist on watching this horrible picture...trust me!!! The best advice I can give anyone is: do not, repeat DO NOT waste your time or money watching DWMC. You'll achieve the same level of pain by simply cutting a finger off....and it'll be quicker too!!! The only reason I rated this movie a 1 is simply because IMDb does not give us the option to rate it a 0 !!! I suggest IMDb corrects this shortcoming as a 0 is even more than this torture of a film deserves...For the record my rating is -1/10","Dude, Where's My Car"

174,apieper-2,"Stupid, in a good way. Kind of.",4,17 December 2000,"This was one of the absolute stupidest movies I have ever seen. It had hundreds of jokes which were just really corny, or which dragged on far too long. Several scenes involve the same two lines being repeated over and over. For example, if you've seen the trailers, you're already aware of the ""And Then..."" Chinese Food window gag. What you may not be aware of is that the joke actually goes on for over two minutes. If you're not sick of jokes like these after seeing the trailers, you'll definitely be sick of them by the end of the movies.The ""lost car"" plot eventually gives way to a second extremely corny sci-fi plot which could appeal to nobody. The characters are reminiscent of the characters in ""Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey"", with low-budget futuristic wardrobes and emotionless dialogue which goes nowhere.Overall, I would say this is a good movie to laugh at. The random choice of wardrobes, accents, props and plot turns lead me to believe that perhaps the movie's plot was the result of a bad round of ""Mad Libs"".Keep an eye out for Michael Bower, A.K.A ""Donkey Lips"" as Big Cult Guy #2.","Dude, Where's My Car"

The plot was never laid out in any of the trailers, and we are left to believe it was going to be an MTV-type movie about partying too hard. When the actual plot arrives, it immediately breaks all the rules and goes straight for the utterly ridiculous, from the moment Jesse (Kutcher) wakes up with Trivial Pursuit cards stuck to his face. As the story unravels piece by absurd piece, the viewer is given only hints as to what Jesse and Chester (Scott) did the previous night, hints which add up to what has to have been the most ridiculous and crazy night ever, but as they don't' remember a thing, we never get the whole story, which honestly is the most hilarious part.We learn that, at some point, they trashed their girlfriends' house, partied with some strippers who now adore them, accepted a briefcase full of stolen money from a transsexual stripper (which they then used to buy a sports car), made out with a seriously hot girl whose muscle-head boyfriend doesn't treat her well, and ran afoul a group of cultists and some space aliens who entrusted them with a weapon capable of destroying the Universe. As I tried to fit all these puzzle pieces together, I found myself cracking up, thinking ""What in the hell DID they do last night??"". And, of course, the money to save their skins from a murderous she-male stripper, the anniversary gifts to save their troubled relationships with their girlfriends, and the weapon to save the Universe are all in their car, which they cannot find.Ultimately, if you are looking for fantastic cinematic achievement, then go back to Art School you stupid hippie blowhard.

The critics of ""Dude...?"" cannot pinpoint what is wrong, and other go-betweens feel stupid or embarrassed for having laughed at this film.  Personally, I think this film would have made Charlie Chaplin laugh himself silly.  It's nonsensical, it's filled with drug-humor (this taboo alone doomed the film to cult status at best within the American audience) ... The reason this film is so denegrated by critics reflects (remarkably) its inverse: Schindler's List.  Both of these films escape the truly critical eye for the viewer's guilt:  with ""Schindler's List"" the viewer is either genuinely sympathetic or guilted into lauding it as a 'cultural event' while the viewer of ""Dude...?"" genuinely laughs in sympathy for similar situations, but is guilted into recognizing the stigma of drugs within polite society.Both films have niche target audiences, but whereas the former is capable of transcending its target audience by guilting humanity into sympathy for a dramatized crime against humanity (i.e. if you cannot understand this you are inhuman), the latter is criticized for an equally accurate portrayal of two stoners in California whose lives are just plain weird.Examine your perspectives before criticizing something as ""bad"".  This film is funny and weird.  I have no idea how to rate it--it is worth watching at least once.  Furthermore--as confusing and less-interesting as an Igmar Bergman film is with alcohol, this film is all the funnier and involving for that consumption.  Enjoy.-Xnoybis","Dude, Where's My Car"

It would have to be one of the worst films ive ever seen - really its the most tragic thing i've seen in so long. It would have been funny if the jokes didn't continue on and on and on, until it got past the point of rediculous and just made you embarressed for the actors - even though i'm sure they thought it was a riot.

I know it is stupid and silly. The Characters are dumb and the story is silly. I don't think i need to explain the story 17 years after the movies release. I just love the bad jokes and silly moments. Its a movie meant to be silly and stupid. Its so underrated. I never got the big lebowski that everyone seems to love. But this movie! I can watch over and over again. Almost every scen has something fun in it. The jokes are coming fast. Cutcher and scott are both going a great job. The supporting cast are excellent. So many great moments jokes and lines! I love it! Like i said a big guilty pleasure.","Dude, Where's My Car"
195,David-Kappel,totally weird!,10,25 August 2006,"I think it's one of the best comedies ever made. I barely expected more than another American pie when I went to see this movie but hell - this one kicks arse!!! It's unlike anything you've ever seen before. I don't think it's half as much fun if you 're watching this movie alone but watching this movie with a couple of friends after partying all night makes it most definitely one of the best comedies you're ever going to see! I got it for 7 bucks and it's really worth it. Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott do a fine job but it can hardly be said that this was a difficult job when it comes to acting. Jenniffer Garner stars in it as well and it's probably the only movie in which I like her.By far the most unusual, brainless and unconventional comedy I've ever seen, yet one of the very best!","Dude, Where's My Car"
196,musicgirl759119,Very original and idiotic idea; but Seann and Ashton make it work,6,23 March 2006,"Yes, we all figured it out; Seann and Ashton are, umm, ""special"" comedians. But you know, they actually have a lot of potential. If they weren't in this movie, I don't know what they would do. Don't get me wrong, everyone else was good too. Actually, only Jennifer Garner...well anyway...Jesse and Chester, two bumbling stoners, wake up one morning from a night of partying and cannot remember where they parked their car which prompts them on a journey to find it and along the way, they encounter a variety of people who include their angry girlfriends Wilma and Wanda whose house they trashed, an angry street gang, a transsexual stripper hounding them for a suitcase full of stolen money, a cult of alien seeking fanatics, and a group of aliens in human form looking for a mystical device that could save or destroy the world.OK, you know what? It really doesn't deserve to be a 4.7. It really wasn't that bad.It should get a 6.0 - 6.5 area. It succeeded at the box office. Yes I realize, it barely did, but none the less, it did. This is a very underestimated comedy. Usually, the only thing that makes me laugh are the people on my boyfriend's football team and the TV show ""Friends"".But this did it, so it did a pretty damn good job! I mean, sure it was pretty predictable, but that's what most comedies are: predictable! After all, it's really the detail things that make you laugh, right? I think that that's what made me laugh, not the plot like those usual sucky comedies. Just give this movie a chance; it has potential. Besides, we all need a good laugh once in a while, and that's why Seann and Ashton were born.","Dude, Where's My Car"

It was not a stupid movie, it was a horrible movie! It had funny parts, but those were few and far between. The plot, which would have been okay if not for the ridiculous ending, was just dumb. This is a movie you expect to leave the movie saying it was funny, but I just couldn't get over it's stupidity to mention anything else. This is a movie to save your money and just wait until it's rentable, and then be glad you didn't see it in a theater.","Dude, Where's My Car"
199,vprabhu,The stupidest (but hardly funniest) movie ever,3,24 December 2000,"I saw Road Trip expecting an unfunny collection of sex and drinking jokes. Like I predicted, it was entirely sex and drinking jokes, but somehow it managed to be clever and outright hilarious. I went into Half Baked with the same mentality. Again, I was surprised by how clever and laugh-out-loud funny the movie was. So after that I expected Dude, Where's My Car? to follow this same brilliance-from-idiocy pattern. I was sorely disappointed when I saw the film. A good 90% of the jokes are terribly cliched, the plot is absurd, but never that comical, and the run-on jokes (two in particular) seem to run on, and on, and on...The fault of this movie does not rest on the actors though. Ashton Kutcher is usually quite funny on That 70's Show, and he brings that same lovably moronic personality to this film. Likewise for Seann William Scott, who was terrific in Road Trip and American Pie. But alas, the material is so weak that the duo don't come off as humorously idiotic, but just idiotic. Some of the minor characters brought a chuckle (mostly due to ludicrous outfits), but sadly, that was the extent of the laughter this film elicited.It wasn't the least funny comedy I've ever seen (although it's close), but it certainly was the stupidest. In Dumb and Dumber, which was the stupidest movie I had ever seen before this one, only the main characters are idiots. In this film it seems everyone in the whole world is an idiot, and that also includes the writers and the unsuspecting moviegoers who shelled out for this. Dude, where's my $5 back?","Dude, Where's My Car"

I've watched it a few times in pieces on HBO, and the stoner humor is pulled off wonderfully by the two lead actors.    I love the scenes like the tattoo one in the tailor's shop.  Of course there is some plain dumb stuff, but not enough to make me annoyed  (unlike the movie""serving sara"".)","Dude, Where's My Car"

Like I said, I knew it would be stupid, I like stupid movies: Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle, Jay and Silent Bob films...but, this...was awful. This movie might be funny if you're under 16 and currently stoned. Just don't don't expect to be amused if otherwise. Your friends may tell you, ""oh it's so funny...it's about pot and stuff. And pot equals funny!"" They're lying, they just want you to suffer through it like they had to in order to feel better. Bottom line, skip this film.","Dude, Where's My Car"
203,Masquerade_Ball,"Dude, it's a Lama!!!",7,28 January 2007,"4.7 out of 10, well maybe, considering if people don't like a movie they usually just give it a 1/10. So technically speaking, just under 50% of voters didn't like this movie. So why wouldn't you like a movie, with 2 stoners, a ""sci-fi"" spin, and lots of hot chicks? Perhaps you're over 40, or maybe you are conservative, and think these 2 characters are a shameful bi-product of the failing education system. But enough about the people who didn't like it.Many label this a stupid movie, which is spot on, it's stupid, which is what makes it funny (in my opinion). Watching these two bungle their way through this ""adventure"", with ad nausium jokes is definitely not for everyone though. Some stand out moments include a drive thru Asian woman, who continually asks ""...and then?"". ""...and no end then!!!"" ""...and the-een???""Also a blind kid who takes advantage of his disability to cop a feel on a ""hot alien babe"". After watching ""Paycheck"" again recently (Ben Afflect, Uma Thurman), there is some storyline connection between both movies, but they are as dissimilar in style as this movie is to Bill & Ted.

204,malisp,"Dude, Where's My [insert cunning quip here]?",10,10 February 2004,"First I must say that I was shocked to see such a low rating for this film. Then, when looking at the demographic breakup, I was shocked again to see that women consistently voted higher for this movie. So I checked out the first page of comments about this movie and I was embarrassed to see such biased and unintelligent comments. Thus, I had to write my own:DWMC is solely a comedy. If you're looking for anything else, you will be disappointed by this film. I would classify it as guy humour, but the voting breakdown here would disagree with me, so I'll try to be more specific. This is not a romantic comedy. While the main characters, Jesse and Chester, obviously care about their girlfriends, they have no epiphanies about love and will only serve as bad examples for boyfriends worldwide.DWMC has also been described as a silly comedy. I would agree with that assessment. To me, Jesse and Chester are Larry and Curly without Moe. The movie also seems like it was written around a bunch of funny skits, which were then tied together with a plot of some kind. What does this mean? Well, it translates to no comedic downtime. Everything you see is either a joke or a setup for a joke (which will be revealed very quickly). Granted, the plot gets a little far-fetched in order to deal with the wide range of ""skits"", but if you approach this film prepared to enjoy a silly comedy, the plot will not bother you.I won't bother to give a complete run-down on the plot, as I said, it's not too important. One thing I will mention is that in essence this is a movie about two best friends bonding through crazy adventures. This is probably the aspect of the film that appeals to me the most and transforms it from a funny film to a great movie I can watch over and over again. By writing this review, I just want to give a true account of this film so that those who would also like this film will not be scared away by reading the reviews. Here it is, plain and simple:If you like Mr. Bean, the Three Stooges, or Monty Python, chances are you will love this movie. If you yearn for the old days of Saturday Night Live, you will enjoy this movie. If you would still like the Simpsons if they removed the social commentary, you would like this move. If your favourite movie is Life as a House, then don't waste your time with DWMC, you'll probably hate it. Either way, if you are going to watch this movie, be prepared for something silly and be sure to rent the movie and not settle for the TV version.","Dude, Where's My Car"

The movie held my attention most of the time. It felt a little long towards the end. Ashton Kutcher does a good job, and Seann Scott continues plays another one of his stupid college-aged roles.

Still, I prefer to think of this film a light hearted sci-fi.  Sci-Fi Lite. I believe that's what I'll call it.The Sci-Fi Lite plot was the only reason I didn't change the channel.  And possibly the fact that there might be a somewhat humorous joke in the remainder of the film.As an alternative Sci-Fi Lite film I would have to recommend ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.""

All pretence of structured plot is surrendered from the start and the entire film consists of non-sequiteur scenes with completely surreal pretexts. The film pays homage to a large number films. The two main characters are lifted almost directly from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, the plot contains direct tributes to Monty Python's Holy Grail and there's a twist of Wayne's World with zest of Cheech and Chong.

While they are searching we encounter aliens, odd russians, and many other characters. However, does any of this really matter? No.  This movie is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. I am the first to admit I do enjoy dumbed-down comedies from time to time but how dumbed down can a movie get?  The first thing you'll notice is that this movie is almost a complete rip-off of a good movie called Half-Baked. The jokes are made for 6 year olds and even they would find them dumb. (Ex: Ashton Kutcher : I've got an idea...Lets Eat   William Scott: No dude,....lets eat!) The story is extremely pointless to begin with and how the director managed to make it even more pointless is beyond me. Basically just avoid this movie at all costs!

I first went into this movie thinking it was some sort of stoner-comedy about two half-wits looking for their car and getting into misadventures with other colorful stoner types as they try to recreate the events of the previous night.  Derivative?  Sure. Done-To-Death?  Probably.  But God, after half an hour of this movie, I was praying for some sort of stupid stoner comedy.  The plot spirals out of control into an incoherent mess, the jokes are incredibly lame (and most importantly, not funny), and by the time of the film's ""climax"" you're simply left begging for it to end.To be fair, the film has it's good points.  Like I said, it wasn't derivative-- it was an original idea with a fresh series of twists.  Good twists?  No, but they were original.  A+ for effort there.  Plus, the film's cast sinks into the material with abandon and perform very well (especially the two stars, Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott-- their chemistry together is good).

This is certainly true. But, just because a comedy is silly and irreverant, that does not mean it is necessarily GOOD. There is not an original joke in this entire film. Moreover, there is not a funny joke in this entire film. The plot is moronic; straight-to-video kid's movies have more coherent storylines. The performances are downright awful, the sexual content is downright offensive (and I am not easily offended - even in moronic comedy, the subject must be handled tastefully (see the American Pie films)), and the direction is careless. There is absolutely no reason why anyone should see this movie, under any circumstances. If you want a silly comedy, rent Monty Python. If you want drug humor, rent a Kevin Smith. If you want juvenile laughs, rent Billy Madison. If you want a dumb sex movie, rent American Pie. It is an insult to the intelligence of the entire world that this movie was even made.

I like a classic, epic, drama as much as the next guy. But, this wasn't one of those. This was a flick to laugh at. If you are generally a happy person and can laugh or cry at commercials, then you will enjoy the antics and slapstick of this movie. If you are constantly judgmental, moody, or jealous when you see other people having a good time... then this might not make you smile. Did I say smile? That's the idea folks. A film that makes you smile is not going to always get an Oscar. This film is far from Dumb & Dumber, and not close to Neil Simon. Lighten up, loosen up, and cheer up with some popcorn and you will laugh.","Dude, Where's My Car"
232,nirmalsuki,What's so bad about this movie?,10,17 August 2005,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's got a lot of really funny scenes. Most of the jokes are original. The story keeps flowing, there is a multitude of characters appearing so that it makes the movie interesting to watch. I still fail to find fault with this movie. I mean, it's no Comic Genius (It's no Dr. Strangelove), but it's comedy that normal people can enjoy, but for some peculiar reason, don't.I am no stoner, and neither are any of my friends :), but this is one of the movies we all saw and enjoyed thoroughly. For it's enjoyability itself, I give it a 10.A note to those who think they can do better : Try. A Kubrick doesn't come along every day. At the end of the day, you'd have made a movie much worse than this.","Dude, Where's My Car"
233,jdimeo,"Dude, Where's My Can of Whup Ass?",1,30 May 2005,"This movie blows major chunks, and has almost single-handedly destroyed my obsession with Seann William Scott.Please don't get me wrong - I dig good teen gross-out movies. In my opinion, Animal House is a classic, and so are American Pies 1 and 2. I even like Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Porky's, fer cryin' out loud.DWMC, however, is so appalling, so insulting, and so horribly wrong that I may need therapy in order to determine why I even ventured to go there in the first place. To think that legitimate actors (SWS, are you listening?) willingly starred in this embarrassing piece of CRAP defies logic, so it had to be the money talking. In which case, the actors truly do suck ass, and in even larger quantities than I originally suspected.As if the movie itself wasn't bad enough, I beg you, don't watch it with the audio commentary on, because it will just throw you into the worst kind of funk. These people vote, they drive cars, and soon they'll breed. When the boys (Seann and Ashton) start discussing what a chick's bowel movement smells like? Um...I'm sorry. Somebody needs to be smacked upside the head, and it's not me. There's no excuse in the world for that kind of sophomoric commentary. It's not funny, it's just...icky.","Dude, Where's My Car"

Comedy is supposed to be original, so repeating lines up to 20 times, and that 5 times in a film that lasts only 80 minutes (though it seems to go on forever) is probably the worst thing you could possibly imagine. Even parading hot babes in leather outfits could not save this film. I don't even mind that there's no story to speak of, or that the acting is lousy at best. The worst thing, of everything that's wrong with this film, is that it didn't even put a wry smile on my face for it's entire duration.

244,Crakin,"Dude, a masterpiece? Sweet.",9,30 January 2004,"Dude, Where's my Car is a cinematic achievement that will no doubt steer the motion picture industry of this decade (and perhaps the entire century) toward a new height.  Dude, Where's My Car came out in 2000 heralding a new golden age in cinema.  I can hardly believe that it has taken three and a half years to finally make it to my DVD collection.  It stands proudly next to the Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and the like.   I am glad that I am now able to review this movie and give it the attention that it truly deserves.This movie works on so many levels and I hope that I am able to touch on a few of the themes.  The movie starts off with Jesse and Chester waking up from a killer party the night before.  Jesse is portrayed by Ashton Kutcher of `That 70's Show' fame and with this movie proves his versatility as an actor.  It may surprise some of you that he was not given an Oscar nod for his portrayal of the hapless but lovable Jesse.  Seann William Scott, the lovable but rude jock from the American Pie trilogy, is able to shine as the cable TV saturated, stoned Chester.  While at first glance he seems to represent the wasted MTV generation stuck behind the boob tube without any ambition for furthering his own goals or being productive in society, we eventually learn that there is more to this man-child that meets the eye. Chester has a large role in finding Jesse's car and (spoiler) saving the universe.The Twins call Jesse and Chester's place to remind them of their anniversary and to inform them that they trashed their place.  So Jesse and Chester go to find the car to get to the twin's house and give them their anniversary gifts.  Unfortunately, Jesse's car is missing and the story is set into motion.  They realize that they have no memories of the night before. Their epic quest begins by seeking a great sage, Nelson that might be able find their lost memories.  Nelson is truly a Zen master but is unable to jog either Jesse or Chester's memory.  Instead, they go to a Chinese restaurant where they find their first obstacle, a psychic duel between Jesse and the lady behind the take-out counter.  Dude, Where's My Car boldly takes head on the taboo subject of racial and society differences.  No racial stereotype is off limits in this film.  Jesse's banter with the over the counter lady is reminiscent of the dialogue between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally.  But instead of touching upon the theme of male-female relations, we learn how difficult it can be to get an order of Chinese take out.  This banter turns out to be too much for our hero Jesse and he is left with only one recourse, physical violence.  So Jesse and Chester are left without take out and without their sage, Nelson.  All hope seems lost when a clue to their previous night approaches.  It is Christie Boner.  She gives them more clues of their missing time.  Unfortunately, for the two protagonists, it is not long before her jock boyfriend, Tommy arrives. The character Tommy may at first seem like an over the top stereotype, but by the end of the film we see his different subtle shades (`stoner bashing time' vs. `nerd bashing time') and different emotions.
Like Alice in Wonderland, the more they look for the car, the further down the rabbit hole they go and further away their goal seems.  They find that they have been to a strip bar in league with a trans-gender stripper, outwitted aliens posing as Hot Chicks, ambiguously gay Nordic aliens, culties, law enforcement officers, and a tailor.  Each step of the way they are given a small hint of the night before and one step closer to the car. It seems that the mystery of the location of their car is wrapped in intergalactic intrigue.  Not only is Jesse's car missing, but so is the Continuum Transfunctioner, whose power is only matched by it's mystery.
After a series of adventures, they find Jesse' car is sold to some unsavory character and the film comes to one of it's high points.  They end up at an osterage farm.  This scene is very reminiscent of the raptor escape scene from one (or any) of the Jurassic Park films, except a little better.  The true danger is not the large birds, but the farmer himself played by Star Trek's Data, Brent Spiner as Pierre.  Another great cameo is Andy Dick as Marc, the poacher.   When Jesse and Chester's fate looks most grim, it is Chester's battle of wits, and extensive television watching, that saves the day.  I am glad that the makers of this film took the angle that watching countless hours of television is not automatically bad and could come in handy if ever caught by a French mad-man.   Unfortunately for Jesse and Chester, the two are no closer to their prize, but this scene sets up the climax of the movie.The final act takes place at a miniature golf park.  They call all the interested parties; Tommy and the Jocks who have the sage Nelson captured, the culties lead by Zartan who have captured the twins, the Nordic aliens claiming to be the Guardians of the Continuum Transfunctioner, their boss Mr. Pizzacoli, and of course, Hot Chicks.  Again, I don't want to spoil it for those who have not seen it, but the film works out in a brilliant way. We see the true friendship between Jesse and Chester.   It reminds me of the developed relationship of Samwise and Frodo.  What is more amazing is that while the Lord of the Rings movies totaled over 9 hours, we get the same level of companionship in a brisk 90 minutes.  We also see that love will prevail, nay, must prevail.  If I have one complaint about the movie is that the Guardians of the Continuum Transfunctioner too easily succumb to the Giant Alien Babe.  I feel that the Guardians would be a formidable opponent not only by their name, keen euro-fashion sense, but also by their very fit build. I can only hope that there was an extended battle scene that did not make it to the final theatrical release.  It is my wish that the director will have an Extended Edition like Peter Jackson and his Lord of the Ring Trilogy, but I find this extremely unlikely.You will most certainly catch me at the midnight showing of Seriously Dude, Where's My Car, the next installment to Dude, Where's My Car story.  I have some inside scoop that this is a major green light!  I heard that the original concept of the Dude saga was to be a trilogy.  I am happy to hear that the studio has already started making the second chapter and I am hoping that it will be profitable enough to make Really, Seriously, Dude, Where's My Car!?! so that we, the public,  will be able to see the Dude story arc in it's entirety.For rich dialogue, multiple themes, brave innovative movie making, and disregarding political correctness, I  highly recommend this film.  This film stands up to multiple viewings and gets better every time it's watched.9.5 out of 10","Dude, Where's My Car"

But it was also not very funny. More semi-nude Ashton would have made up for it, I think. The program guide on the TV gave it one star and called it a `meandering, unfunny comedy.' There were some funny parts. Hal Sparks was pretty good as the leader of the space nerds, as was Andy Dick as the weird fellow in the cage. The rest of it was pretty much just stupid and mindless.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I thought it was a completely irrelevant buddy comedy, with disposable lines and a ridiculous story.But for a while it was on heavy rotation on one of the channels I subscribed to, and I ended up seeing it in parts many times over... and slowly I came to love it for the disposable masterpiece it is. I'd find myself catching a part of it, and not being able to stop watching. So I've seen the start maybe three times, the middle probably 10 times, and the end 20 times.And eventually, over time, it became my favourite comedy movie. It's just so ridiculous, so stupid and so funny. The acting is good, the production values are good, the humour is good.

Its got some great humour, playing on stereotypes, (e.g. pot smoking junkies, gay Nordic men.) OK, so it is completely unrealistic, but anyone who takes this film seriously is an idiot.

I haven't even seen this movie in at least three years, yet as I read the quotes I found myself laughing out loud. I suggest this movie to everyone with a sense of humor. It has great quotes and great acting. I can't even think of anything bad to say about this film. Actually, the only tasteless joke was the one about panties and going on a ride....if you see this movie, you'll know what I'm talking about.

I saw it when I was 19; I wasn't a fan, but I listened to the commentary track, and realized how many details were cut from the movie to get the PG-13 certificate. Many years later, I found it on broadcast television. Now the ""edited for television"" version has some additional cuts and ADR lines to secure a network-friendly edit. Chop once for the MPAA, chop twice for MyTV. I'm finding some parts truly funny, but then I wait and wait for something else to happen. It's not consistent enough at anything for me to consider it ""well-done"". The under-18 segments rated it higher than the males 18-29.

I simply cannot believe anyone could find this movie humourous.  It's been said that you have to go see it with the right attitude.  Well DUH!!!  You don't go to a movie with a title like ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and expect a classy comedy.  Don't get me wrong, I love movies that are considered stupid.  I loved Jack Frost (the horror), Dumb and Dumber, etc.  So I went in expecting exactly what you're saying to expect, but that's not what was delivered.  Not only was the movie predictable, poorly acted and in poor taste, but it was annoying too.  Of the three times I laughed in this movie, they ruined it by running with the joke for five more minutes.  When they got their tattoos and the chinese drive thru come to mind.  Not even Saturday Night Live overkill their jokes this badly.  And it wasn't that the jokes were tasteless (which I usually like) but that they were really really really juvenile.  They had jokes in their that were reminiscent of jokes I used to say in the 6th grade.  In fact, I believe that the only way anyone could like this movie is if they have the 6th grade mentality.  Anyways, this would have been the ""one and only"" movie that I've ever walked out on, but my friend was the one who drove me there and he wouldn't leave.

But this i have to tell.Tonight, December 16, 2000, I sit here in my chair in Maryville, Missouri convinced that civilization is on the brink of collapse. Humanity is destined to destroy itself and every living thing on this planet, and I have the evidence. I went to see ""Dude, Where's My Car"".I would just come right out and say this is, bar none, the worst film ever made. But it's much more complex than that.My friends and I (who are about the same age as the characters) are college students who occasionally end up wasted and forget what we did, as is the premise of the movie. I even talked about making a movie about all of it. However, someone got to my idea first. Now my dream of making that film is crushed because I will never believe anyone will see it because of this movie.It's not just horrible, it's horrible on every level.It's not funny at all. The commercials made it look like it would be full of laughs, a 'american pie' or 'something about mary' kind of thing. I didn't laugh a single time, and I'll laugh at anything.There is no plot. I constantly felt as one does when you run into something, and spin about wildly, bewildered for a few seconds. Characters pop in and out of the screenplay with no ryhme or reason. Each scene is built around one or two jokes, which aren't funny to begin with.I can't relate to this at all. I thought the film would be two people waking up with hangovers, retracing what they did the night before. Well, I'm convinced they were getting to that part- just as you find out that the entire chain of events was triggered by extra terrestrials with a sinister plot to destroy the universe. No, I'm not kidding.You can't even laugh at how bad it is. I enjoy watching bad movies occasionally. It's funny to laugh at their badness, and sometimes you have to wonder if they intentionally made it bad. But not this one. You can't even watch it on that level. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in this film, and those who produced it should be drawn and quatered.To sum it all up, this film made my ears bleed. It has set the science of cinematography back 50 years. I do not think that I will ever be able to sit down in a theatre seat again without a chilling running down my spine.

The point of the movie is about two stoners who wake up one day to find out that they've completely trashed their girlfriends' house, won a lifetime supply of pudding, and somehow misplaced their car.  The kicker: THEY DON'T REMEMBER A THING.  So they head out on a road to nowhere to find the missing vehicle.  Along the way they run into many characters such as a band of cult members hoping to get into space, and Andy Dick playing a guy chained up in someone's basement for the last couple of years.The terrible part is that throughout all this are stale bimbo jokes, lame Bill and Ted knockoffs, and nearly every stereotype that Hollywood obviously thinks every 18 or 19 year old interacts with.  You've got nerds, bullies, big breasted chicks, whatever you want to come up with.This isn't to say that this wouldn't make a good rental or something to watch on HBO, but to see it in the theater is not the best waste of money out there.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I figured it was probably in the realm of Wayne's World or Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. I was wrong. I'm surprised I didn't walk out, but that was just in an attempt to somehow try to get at least a fraction's enjoyment of the $8.50 I spent on it.

It starts out well enough, with two stoners trying to find their car after a night of partying. I mean everyone can relate, right. As they journey on their quest to find said stonermobile they meet all types of wacky characters. A transvestive they owe 200,000 dollars to, a pot smoking dog, some guy that talks like Yoda, hot alien chicks, two Nordic guys, the hottest of the hot- Chrissy Boner (I kid you not),a group of thug jocks and Space nerds dressed in bubble wrap. Whew! My head hurts.I guess the point I'm trying to make is that like Jesse and Chester after seeing this ""movie"" I feel like I was out all night slamming Jagermeister shooters. Things like a plot and jokes aren't needed when you have that kind of crazy lineup of characters, right. Wrong. I feel dumber for having watched it.

271,zblizzard,It could have been so much better,4,5 March 2002,"** Warning, possible spoilers ** I enjoyed ""Dude, Where's My Car"" because the humour is so base and the characters so shallow that you do not have to think hard to understand what is happening, which, at the time, was a welcome relief. The basic premise is that two Los Angeles men, Jesse and Chester, wake up in their house without a clue as to what happened the previous night because they got so drunk. An answering machine message from the pair's annoyed girlfriends (who are twins) kickstarts them into trying to piece together what happened, with the ultimate goal being discovering Jesse's car and recovering the gifts that the guys had bought their girlfriends for their one year anniversary. The humour is coarse and childish, although at some times it was highly original. One joke that the film relies on is the over exaggerated stereotypical groups in the movies who are all after a mysterious (and somewhat superficial) continiuum transfunctioner. The introduction of this element takes the film from stupid to ridiculous, because these groups do not laugh at themselves, such as the ""gay Nordic guys"" or the Zoltan group and while a little of this is humorous, every new group is treated the same by the writers - Jesse and Chester are at first bemused, but they laugh at them and dismiss them or attempt to take advantage of them. I would have liked to have seen the guys completing the jigsaw of their evening, so that we could build up a chronological picture of what actually happened. What the film actually does it drop in some piecemeal information without explaining or contextualising it and thus, it leaves the viewer in limbo by moving onto something as equally as unrealistic or senseless. For instance, the fact that Jesse and Chester bought ""dougnuts for the entire precinct"" is never touched upon again in the rest of the movie and it simply throws up more questions that are left unanswered, such as why did the guys go to the strip club in the first place, or what happened when the guys met the cops? After a fairly whimsical chase for the continuum transfunctioner (the identity of which could be guessed at easily, but this was undoubtedly the point), Jesse and Chester save the day in a neat twist in the only part of the movie where the guys apply themselves or do anything useful. I couldn't help thinking that the plot could have been done better. The jokes, I thought, were generally fine (""And denn?"" etc.). A tighter, more realistic plot which reflected the decisions that the guys would have made, as innocents and stoners, would have served the film better. A more explanatory script could have strung together the descent parts of the movie together better and would have not left the audience feeling empty.","Dude, Where's My Car"
272,tdwhea,"Stupid, but Really Funny",8,13 March 2002,"Before I saw this movie, I was worried that all the funny parts had been shown in the trailers. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was packed with laughs and more creative than I thought possible. Even though the humor was probably primarily direct at teenage guys, it seemed to rely on a more intelligent form of comedy than the typical bathroom humor of Road Trip or American Pie. My take: funnier than Road Trip, not as funny as American Pie. If you're a fan of those types of movies, don't miss out on Dude, Where's my Car? If not, you may still want to take a chance on it.","Dude, Where's My Car"
273,Movie_Freak2341,"Worst movie, EVER!",1,16 October 2002,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"" Is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. It's a typical teenage movie, but even more revolting with a story that is as deep as your household sink. Considering it is a summer movie though the story is not so important, but what is important is the humor which does not make it past the word ""Dude!"". The humor is redundant and the story is dull and boring. This is the type of movie that makes me despise Hollywood.","Dude, Where's My Car"
274,lahoriboy2000,The worst movie of all times.,1,18 June 2009,"Dear readers, I'm sure that you must have watched, hundreds of stupid movies, but none compared to this. The plot of the movie is not well conceived at all, totally illogical, & senseless. The story revolves around a trans-functioner from a outer space that is introduced in the middle of the movie. Two female leads (Jennifer Garner & Marla Sokoloff) are casted as guest stars, only appeared on screen not more than 5 times in short scenes. Both male leads don't know anything about anything & they don't remember anything. I was bored down to tears & most of the times I had to forward. All actors are over acting through out the movie.This is most worst movie that I've ever watched. Jesse & Chester are shown stupids beyond the human limits.

275,TeddyBare,OUTSTANDING COMEDY!!!,10,9 February 2003,"This has to be one of the funniest movies of all time, especially with such academic performances by Ashton Kutcher (That 70s Show) and Seann Scott William (Road Trip, American Pie). The film starts with the duo losing their car, and forgetting it's whereabouts. In fact they can't even remember what happened the previous night! What follows is a madcap chase to track down the vehicle via any means possible... this involves going to a Chinese tailors, local vehicle pound and getting thrown in a farmer's jail cell... only to be taken to a barn (that's not red) and wearing bubble-wrap to fool two guards.Truly great, entertaining value for money, I wholeheartedly reccomend this title to any comedy fan!","Dude, Where's My Car"
276,likebox,One of the great comedies of all time,10,24 April 2010,"This movie has a perfect script, it is perfectly acted, the directing is visionary, and even the cheap special effects are iconic. If this isn't the best comedy of the decade, that's because it's the best comedy of all time.The plot seems rudimentary: two stoners wake up with no memory, and can't find their car. They have a ""Who's on first"" dialogue about their car, then they go about the business of reconstructing the forgotten events of the previous day, with impossibly funny gags thrown in at an unprecedented pace.It quickly becomes clearer that what they forgot was not any ordinary day. They forgot that which is impossible to forget.A lifetime supply of jello! Thirty stolen pizzas! And that's just the appetizer. each event is quickly one-upped by an even more unforgettable event, and the writer is constantly daring you to imagine what could possibly be more unforgettable, only to reveal it, and deliver.A suitcase of money! A transsexual stripper! Making out with ""Christie Boner""! Hot space-chicks in jumpsuits! Space-nerds dressed in bubble wrap! Nordic space-dudes! Finally, the most mysterious and powerful object in the whole universe, and it was right under your nose! And everything hangs together--- not a single plot-point is forced, everything seems inevitable, everything works. That's virtuoso writing.I know what you're thinking: I could easily top these plot events by throwing in hostile ostriches and a fifty foot tall woman. You're right.The movie is like a Russian doll: each outrage is a small part of an even bigger outrage. There is no cheap laugh. Even the silliest gags are rooted in deeply intelligent observations, like the way in which the idiomatic Chinese transliterated phrase ""and then"" is often used inappropriately by Chinese speakers of English. Or the way in which any folksy wisdom can be turned into funny by translating to Yoda. Or how shibby can put a ""Llama"" label your mental ostrich.Like Charles Bukowski's ""Pulp"", the movie doesn't shy away from having space aliens in the plot with no hesitation or explanation. The dialog is written in vapid language, so that the intelligence is only revealed in the higher-level structure. This makes the movie seem superficially dumb to dumb people.If this movie were dumb, it couldn't be so devastatingly funny. I saw it when it came out, and I nearly died laughing in an otherwise empty movie theater.I assure you that every single plot point is resolved in a satisfying way, no loose threads. And that's a tall order for a movie with this many threads.The attention to detail is unbelievable. Each of the different groups of characters each have different elaborate hand signals which they use. The costumes are inspired--- the bubble wrap suits, the most perfect outfits in cinema history, cost $0 to make. The track-suits make the stoners look out of touch, the jumpsuits make the aliens look alien, the pizza outfit make Mr. Pizzacolli look like a Pizza shop owner, without any effort. This is the triumph of imagination over budget.Another effort by this director ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"" was very good too, but not at the same iconic level as this one. ""Harold and Kumar go to Guantanamo"" was spotty, marred by unnecessary Republican apologia.","Dude, Where's My Car"

282,MonstrousWalker,It's Own Kind of Wonderful,8,6 January 2005,"I had a somewhat different preparation than most prior to viewing this film. I somehow missed out on all the trash reviews; to the contrary it came well recommended. Michael Moore, he of the 8.5 rated documentary, ""Bowling For Columbine"", paid homage to ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" by naming his latest book ""Dude, Where's My Country?"", and it may or may not have been him (I don't remember)who considered it required viewing for anyone who wanted to learn about America. So, to amend the saying, anyone who wants to understand America had better learn baseball, and had better watch ""Dude, Where's My Country?"".I loved this film, and I loved ""Office Space"", for one, two very different kinds of comedies that can reach your funny-bone if you approach them in the right frame of mind. ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is probably its nearest cousin. For what it's worth, I loved ""Happy Gilmore"" but flat-lined on ""Caddyshack"". I guess there's no accounting for taste. Yes, ""Dude"" is stupid-funny, but it's stupid-funny very well done.","Dude, Where's My Car"

Beavis and Butthead, Wayne's World, Bill and Ted, and Dumb and Dumber, (Except this is way dumber dude) 2 dudes. One w/ brown hair the other blonde both dumb asses. Stuck in a situation that is basic (and to anyone else uneventful), but due to their stupidity towards problem solving you have a plot. In this movie however the plot evolves every 5 minutes in order to keep it alive. You'd like to think its funny, but it really isn't. Ashton Kutcher needs to go back to that 70's Show, because him starring in a movie just isn't working. We're not laughing with you dude. Seann William Scott isn't as bad and he has played in other movies that are good, but unfortunately this movie is about as funny as its title.","Dude, Where's My Car"
284,t-a-walker,A very stupid movie that is fun to watch anyway,8,22 June 2005,"Put simply, this movie is about two stoners who wake up from a wild party the night before with no memory of what happened last night or what has happened to their car. Their search for the titular vehicle takes them on a quest of literally cosmic proportions.I was prepared to hate this movie before seeing it on satellite (there was nothing else on), but as I watched it I ended up laughing and actually getting involved in it. Yes, it is very, very stupid, juvenile, and often crude, but then again it doesn't try to be anything more than this. It reminded me of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, which was another dumb but fun movie. The movie is also one of the first appearances of Jennifer Garner, playing one of the girlfriends of the two protagonists. Speaking of which, Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott are great in their roles, although whether it is good acting or just them being themselves is certainly debatable.If you see this movie expecting sophisticated comedy, you'll be sorely disappointed, but if you are in the mood for fairly mindless comedy, this will fit the bill admirably.","Dude, Where's My Car"

289,Melba T,Most people won't like this movie -- they are unworthy of it's brilliance.,10,16 December 2000,"This film is being universally decried because it was not released for critical review prior to public opening.  Critics are bitter like that. If they don't get to see it first, they get all whiny and then say that the film will suck.Hence the case with ""DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?"" -- a film of unparalleled majesty.  The jocular, zen attitude of the WAITING FOR GODOT-esque protagonists may be dismissed as juvenile and flatulent by the embittered critics -- again, they will use this to screen their failure to see the effervescent marvel that is ""DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?""The episodic journey is a jigsaw puzzle artfully constructed by a lunatic, and the audience is privy to its series of gradual revelations as Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Sean Michael Scott) piece together the enigma of their missing night of fun and frolic -- and the location of their vehicle.  The manner in which our heroes face each obstacle and each realization is an inspiration; nothing -- whether it be a gang of jealous jocks, a veritable convention of sci-fi geeks, or a psychotic desk officer at the police impound -- interrupts the high spirits and unflagging optimism of the duo.The hidden twist at the end has been well-concealed in all previews and trailers and is clearly the reason why reviewers were not given advance showings.  Don't wake up and find that this gem of a movie has disappeared from your driveway, as it will certainly be hailed as the film that reinvented the teen comedy for the new millennium.

And this is coming from someone who finds the Uranus joke kinda funny.Every time you think that the movie will somehow steer itself back to its flimsy excuse for a plot, it spirals off onto some newly irrelevant tangent. There ARE a few moderately amusing bits: I have to admit that the blind-camp counsellor getting packaged got a chuckle out of me. The Monty Python spoof had promise but was delivered clumsily.

The entire movie is based around the adventure that the two pot heads have as they try to find their car and figure out what they did the night before. Bland humor, old jokes, aliens, trans-sexual strippers and overused catch phrases caused my mind to wander while I sat in the theater.  For some reason the creators of the film decided to add alien beings to the film for no apparent reason.  Ashton Kutcher is funny in That 70's Show and Sean William Scott will forever be remembered as the irreverent Stifler from American Pie, but this movie wasted what little ability they have to make the audience laugh. If you watch the TV spots, you have basically seen the best parts of the movie, which is pretty sad. I consider myself a good judge when it comes to movies, but that aside anyone can see that this movie is all hype and doesn't deliver at all.","Dude, Where's My Car"
299,tembrey,"It should make you ashamed to laugh at humor this low, almost.",6,17 December 2000,"Walking out from the movie, I almost felt guilty laughing so hard that I actually stopped breathing.  The plotline is completely unpredictable, simply because of the complete randomness.  The movie is in the exact same vein as ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Something About Mary,"" no class, but just too damn funny to walk out of.  There was actually a part of the movie I laughed so hard, I not only stopped breathing, but I actually had to plug my ears and close my eyes, because if I laughed any more, I would have thrown up.The unfortunate aspect of this movie is that it only appeals to members of the human race with a Y chromosome and the age (mental or physical) of fifteen.  The jokes are crass and full of the lowest forms of humor, but I will be damned if I didn't laugh myself silly at this flick.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I enjoy most films and really liked Road Trip, American Pie, and other similar films.Dude wheres my car however is not at all like these in the sense that its not really funny at all! This being the main point of the film the rest was just pointless. I watched it all the way through because i was hoping the whole time for it to pick up but it never happened.I don't mean to be too harsh but i've seen most main stream films and i would rate this (along with Cable Guy) as the worst of all of them.","Dude, Where's My Car"

Though it had its share of raunch, it was somewhat refreshing to see a movie where the humour did not rely on sexual perversion. The film was reminiscent of Dumb and Dumber, without the polished comedic ferver of Carrey and Daniels. Scott and Kutcher did a find job acting like complete asses, and though the plot took a turn for the worst in the finale...this film was one of the funniest I've seen in years.

310,poorellensmith,uh...duh?,1,17 December 2000,"wow.  okay, so color me optimistic, but i really thought that this movie might have some smart moments in it.  it was clear just from the trailers that Dude is a bill & ted's knock-off film, but bill and ted DID have some smart commentaries hidden in there, if you looked hard enough, and it WAS genuinely funny.  so i was hopeful.  how wrong i was.not only is this film a grossly immature, predictable, boring adventure in T&A, it's also blatantly homophobic and, mask your surprise here, totally sexist.  i mean, hey, who am i to suggest that maybe, just maybe, we don't need a view of the skirt of the woman who is all set to destroy the earth?!? and maybe there's something weird about killer ostriches, but it's certainly not funny. and without saying too much about the ending, i will say that it reminded me of a chant we used to sing on the bus when i was in the 5th grade...which is appropriate, i guess, since that's apparently the maturity level this film is aiming for.  in that case, well, job well done!the one thing i WILL say for this film, though, is that it has turned movie theaters into venues for my newest spectator sport: jock watching.  the theater was PACKED with white, zit-faced, pathologically heterosexual guys who you just KNOW will end up doing beer bongs in a fraternity one day soon. and it was REALLY entertaining to watch their synchronized reactions to the film.  they were almost as predictable as the film itself.you know it's sad when you go to the $5 matinee and want $4 back at the end. it's even worse when you want all $5, plus a few dollars more for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.","Dude, Where's My Car"

If anyone invested any thought into watching this film, they were as pleased as I at the ostrich scene, the music video scene, the ""hot chicks"" and every other well-planned comedic device/mind-bending plot element of the movie.

Maybe, after drinking a lot of beer, this could be a comedy for you but otherwise, stay away from it.

328,pixiescarecrow,"Best Movie of 2000, suckas",9,1 September 2001,"Heads up, I make mention of some details that make better sense if you've actually seen the film before you read it. Atypical for a review, true, but, well, it's more of a breakdown analysis. A little bone thrown to those effing whiners that claim this movie is dreck. Rock on.I feel the need to defend this film against the onslaught of attacks it has unjustly received. It seems many people went to see a movie called DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? expecting something deep and insightful. I once again come dangerously close to losing all faith in humanity. But if the current President of the U.S. didn't push me over that edge, I don't believe this trifle will, either. And, truth be told, despite that there is nothing ""deep"" about this film, there is a bit more to it than some of its fans seem to let on.Some people believe this movie has little plot, if any. I think it has a very concrete and obvious plot: two guys ask where their car is for ninety minutes. There is, of course, the parallel plot of the quest for the continuum transfunctioner, and there are an abundance of minute details that seem random until they reappear later in the film to tie the loose ends together. Thus it is an intricately woven tapestry of the detail in which we have two guys asking where their car is for ninety minutes. Despite the cheesy metaphor, I am serious. The screenwriting was quite clever.But it was just for laughs, and there were a few less-than-brilliant moments. The weed-smoking dog comes to mind. But, then again, it served its purpose later in the film. But, an interesting thing to note while on the subject, for a movie about two stoners, the only one to toke was a dog. A little strange, maybe, but the movie would have been horrible otherwise. Stoned people aren't that funny or interesting, if you've noticed.The one off-balance part of the movie was the scene with Brent Spiner (whose French accent was hysterical) and Andy Dick. I like the two of them, and I definitely liked the scene, it just seemed to be out of the flow. I guess, to me, Andy Dick humor is just that shade more coarse, enough to nudge the mellow out of alignment. Or, another possibility, I may just be hypersensitive. That's probably it.And speaking of Seann William Scott's stellar performance...suffice to say stellar.I guess I overstated it in the title. It can only be the second best movie of 2000, topped by WONDER BOYS. But perhaps I could say WONDER BOYS is the best sophisticated comedy of last year, and DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is the best unsophisticated comedy. Come on, kids, with a fridge full of pudding, ""llamas,"" a character named Mr. Pizzacoli, and ""Bust a Move""...what more could you want? Just relax and stop being so afraid that someone might catch you laughing.","Dude, Where's My Car"
329,iyer-aditya,Stupid. Dumb. Idiotic. Anything but Funny.,1,25 March 2007,"A film which tries hard to be like an American stupid/funny movie (Dumb & Dumber. The Stupids etc.) but ends up being all stupid and no funny.I always was of the opinion that Ashton Kutcher could not act and you know what? My opinion about him has been strengthened ten times over by this movie.Sean Scott comes off a little better though as he has been playing similar stereotype roles (american pie, final destination) of a dumb American teenager; which is no credit to him in anyway.All the cast/crew in the film seem to be extras as the entire film concentrates totally on the two 'Dudes', which I found a little annoying. Also, some scenes & sequences are totally unasked for, which can be forgiven given that this is a dumb movie, but since they are no funnier than Mount Rushmore, they don't serve any purpose at all.Recommended only if you are a retard or if your IQ is below 50.","Dude, Where's My Car"

335,LozF1,American Pie was actually funny...,2,18 January 2004,"I'd class this film in the teen comedy genre (like American Pie) which, as a teenager myself, would expect to enjoy and can relate to.With 'Dude, where's my car?' I can do neither.Instead of enjoyment, throughout this film I was annoyed. I can imagine how the stereotyped groups in the film would react (the blind, Chinese, French, homosexuals, transvestites) and despite being in none of these groups I thought this was laughing at someone else's expense was unacceptable. They couldn't even get the two apparent German homosexual space characters right; the two of them sounded Welsh! (No disrespect) If the writers wanted to use the spoof kind of humour, why didn't they take notice of Austin Powers, and why mock such groups instead of mocking teenager's lifestyles like in American Pie in an intelligent way. I mean, if these two 'idiots' are supposed to stoners then what indicates to the audience that this is the case, they resemble no stereotype I am aware of of stoners?The jokes in the film are very poor and some last for far too long- such as the Chinese takeaway scene and the tattoo scene, and you begin to get very angry as the joke continues beyond your temperament. The storyline is utterly ridiculous which I suppose is what is it meant to be but it is far too over-exaggerated. Two teens get intoxicated and can't remember what happened the night before, so what? Do you need to get stupidly drunk to be popular? Didn't think so. I did also notice that the director tried hard to avoid continuity errors- he always made sure that when the two main characters either ate or had rubbish bins tipped on their heads they'd bear the scars afterwards. The group of apparent 'stoner bashers' are likely the group off Grease, what's that all about? The film is real cheesy but not in a half-decent, 'scary movie' kind of way. The SFX towards the end are terrible even though the film was made in 2000 and called breasts who-who's is going to far; its not remotely funny (like the entire film then, really)I'm afraid I can't think of anything good to say about this film, apart from it's thankfully less than 2 hours long.","Dude, Where's My Car"

I think all this is too similar to be a coincidence.~~~ OPEN YOUR MOUTH!!~~~","Dude, Where's My Car"
344,nasher2123,This movie has zero comedic value,1,20 November 2015,"My friends coated me into watching this movie one night and I couldn't make it more than about thirty minutes in. I actually wanted to shoot myself. Not to kill, of course, but to injure myself bad enough that I would have gone to the hospital for an extended stay with plenty of drugs. Hopefully during my drug-induced state I would have been able to forget what it is I just saw, unfortunately I did not have a gun and the stupidity has been ingrained in my mind such that no amount of drugs could possibly save me now. This movie is not funny. There are indeed ""stupid-funny"" movies out there. This movie can only be considered purely stupid. And it begins with the lead actors, both of which are not funny. Ashton Kutcher is awful at everything he does, and this movie is no exception. Sean William Scott does nothing but grin his stupid grin with a cheap stoner facade laid on top and spew idiotic lines every now and again. There is absolutely no amount of praise that any actor in this movie deserves, and to give any kind of praise, to both the actors and the movie as a whole, would be to liken oneself to a rock. Correction, I think even a rock would be better at judging this movie than most people. At least you could count on a rock to not laugh. But the acting is not even the worst part. In the thirty minutes of the movie I watched, not once was I compelled to genuinely laugh. Of course a few cheap laughs were drawn from my throat, but that was only as a result of my friends laughing hysterically at the movie and my own nervous reaction to what I believed to be the loss of my friends' sanity. The set ups for the jokes make zero sense. They leave their house at the beginning and stand on the curb for five minutes going back and forth with ""Dude, where;s my car?"" ""Where's your car dude?"" ""Dude, where's my car?"" ""Where's your car dude?"" and so on and so forth given in the terribly portrayed stoner voices that fall flat. How is that funny? Indeed it is stupid, but stupid to the point that it is funny? Absolutely not. Repetition of the same stupid line over and over does not equal comedy. Then they visit their stoner friend with his stoner dog. WOW! HAHAHA a stoner dog! That's so funny! He's hitting a dog-shaped bowl! Oh wow that dog smokes pot hahahaha just like all of us this is so funny! Yeah lets focus on the stoner dog and not the shakily thrown-together plot that they are desperately and of-handedly trying to unfold before us. Of course I suppose coherent and reasonable plot is not necessary when people are only watching the movie for its stupidity value. The worst part of the movie that I saw was the Chinese food scene. That is NOT funny. Again, repetition of the same line over and over does not equal comedy. The scene drags on, and for some reason the longer it went the more my friends laughed. Why they laughed is beyond me. There was nothing funny about that. How can saying ""and theeeeennn??"" fifty times over be considered funny? It's not, its just stupid. This movie is an absolute waste of time, and yeah I realize that the people who enjoy these kinds of movies have absolutely zero regard for what it takes to make decent cinema, but I mean come on. The fact that people think this movie is even remotely worth a person's time really gives me doubts about our future. This is terrible. If you have not seen it yet and do not wish to waste your time on a stupid movie with horrible acting and tired, cheap jokes, avoid this movie at all costs.","Dude, Where's My Car"
345,obnauticus,"On of the most ludicrous, far out comedies ever made",8,6 June 2005,"The Bizarre innuendo, the conflicting sides, the stoner methos. It's like somebody took ""The Big Lebowski,"" removed what little sense that movie made, added a second stoner character, and made it less important, less intelligent, and almost as funny. But perhaps that's a bad comparison, I don't really know.This movie is so dumb it's brilliant. The purposefully campy acting, the nonsensical plot points, the throw away characters all add up to the worst day Jesse and Chester ever had, and trying to find a car, ends up finding Andy Dick locked in a cage.That really sums up the movie... ""Andy Dick locked in a cage.""","Dude, Where's My Car"

347,hollieglover_02,U r all mad!,9,24 May 2005,"oh my god, this film is the best! it is funny and stupid but thats the fun of it! i mean what do u expect out of a film titled ""dude, wheres my car"" how can u say this film isn't good! i mean your entitled to your opinion but u cant say there r no funny parts! I'm loving the Chinese food incident where he has the argument with a machine! and saying that it is a film that only stoner's could enjoy, i ain't no stoner!Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott are so good as a duo! they ain't a pair that people would expect but they so totally work together! this is a film that i watch over and over and my friends and i have a lot of person jokes on! nd i am loving the rap that Jessie and Chester do! it is the best!","Dude, Where's My Car"
348,matrxraven,People are being really hard on this movie!,8,25 June 2005,"It seems to me that everyone on the internet has a problem with remaking old movies. Grumbling beings when anyone mentions the upcoming 'Honeymooners', 'The Longest Yard', or even 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars' franchises, but in this case, people have a problem with updated rehashes of classic material WITHIN movies! Maybe some of the jokes aren't BRAND new (comparisons to Abbott and Costello in this movie are plentiful), but it's not the jokes themselves that are important, it's how well they correlate with the storyline - or on the other extreme, how random they can be without detracting from that storyline. Look, the casting in this movie is excellent, even the small roles are filled well by Kristy Swanson (Boner!), Andy Dick, and Brent Spiner (Data of Star Trek fame in an uncredited role), among others (even though I don't understand how Marla Sokoloff and Jennifer Garner could possibly be mistaken for 'twins'). Furthermore, the story, and especially the ending, are certainly witty and yes, dare I say it, original despite the '50 Foot Woman' gag, and the jokes, despite being a bit retro, are delivered well by two guys who really aren't even comedians - as opposed to say, the Dumb and Dumber movies which were MUCH more pedantic than this movie! The rips in this movie aren't even really rips, but satire of movies such as 'Star Wars' and '50 Foot Woman' and seem completely random. Like elementary school writing assignments where the teachers give students the opening line, this movie goes to places the viewer could never imagine from that opening line, the simple yet perplexing question, 'Dude, Where's My Car?' By the end of the movie you're wondering if someone changed the channel, but in this case I think it works! Not to mention the Chinese Food scene and the tattoo scene are some of the funniest weed-induced dialogues this side of Ridgemont High! So don't be so hard on this movie. It wasn't very presumptuous and has gone on to become a stoner classic! And what's this? It was derived from a script for a Beavis and Butthead live action movie? It all makes sense now!","Dude, Where's My Car"
349,mlo1988,boys who can't stop taking drugs,10,6 July 2005,i thought the movie was great and funny and crazy and i think Charlie O'Connell is sexy as hack and by the way everybody the bachelor be off the the air for a while now he already pick the girl he want to be with so tell the people of this website they need to update there mess got it!!!!!!! see the people need to update because i am upset when i come to see this person and the don't update him at all they do his brother why not him people!!!!!!

350,f_emmerechts,terrible,1,3 October 2005,"I like all kinds of films.That includes silly comedies.Not this one however, for all the reasons that other people have already eloquently put in their comments before me.Sadly, I went to see this film in the cinema, together with some friends.People make mistakes, I know that now.Until today, it's the only time ever that I stood up in the middle of the movie and walked out of the theater (better things to do).And I was not the only one.Awful ! Why didn't this film go straight to video, I wonder? Is there anyone who really likes it (apart from one or two jokes)","Dude, Where's My Car"
351,lefevrebert,Never seen worse,1,11 August 2005,"I saw this movie and have to tell it: this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life.I don't understand that this still gets a 4.7 / 10 rate.Even if you like movies in this genre like Dumb & Dumber, you still get annoyed by the bad, boring 'jokes'. It's not funny at all, never! The whole movie is pointless, extremely boring and frustrating. I don't understand what the director was thinking when he made this awful movie. Is it funny to hear 2 friends say: *""dude where's my car?"" -""dude where's your car?"" *""where's my car dude?"" -""dude, where your car?"" *.....For about 10 minutes long?? No it isn'tAvoid at all cost.","Dude, Where's My Car"
352,didrikm,"A sweeeeet movie, dude an' ""thhhheeeeeeeeeen"" some more",7,9 September 2005,"About two dumb-wits who cannot recall anything from the night before. As they retrace their steps from the night before, they realize that it must have been a very wild night indeed! Involving strippers, aliens, a year supply of pudding, more chicks, dodging killer ostriches,nerds and the continuum transfunctioner.Not a very serious movie, but great for the guys to sit down and have a few cold beers before going to the party. It's funny, very funny The protectors of the continuum transfunctioner will have you rolling on the floor, particularly if you are of Scandinavian origin.But frankly, this is a movie that you will either love or Hate. Hopefully you belong to the first group!","Dude, Where's My Car"
353,bded0,Wonderful,10,6 August 2006,"Awesome flick, truly one of the best short conservative movies I've ever seen. Everything was so well done especially the first scene (not counting the ""dream""). And how they made the whole ""aliens"" thing true mad it more enjoyable, making fun or cults makes me give high marks. A previous comment here said ""don't waste your time,"" I'd give that advice for a girl, but I would make a guy watch it (but the guy in question may have already seen it). And, by the way, Brent Spiner playing a French ""dude"" in a short cameo sequence was extraordinary. I really wish I could see more films like this, and has gone into my ""top 10,"" no question.","Dude, Where's My Car"
354,linkinpark_hottie22,whats wrong with you?,10,23 February 2006,"this movie was so funny you cant help but laugh. unless you are a dried up old hag like SOMEONE who thinks this movie sucks. Ashton K.and Sean W.S. were hilarious in this film. you MUST be uptight to rate this a-list movie a 1. This movie is more for an audience who like bBeavis and butt head (who can rock on by the way!) and south park. Although this movie is definitely not for children under the age of 13, i think that most adults would enjoy this film maybe up to the age of 50 but i am not saying 50 year old people cant have fun. In my opinion this movie is severely under-rated. my friends and i quote this movie frequently. if you have any taste and a sense of humor you will love this movie!","Dude, Where's My Car"
