0,TheLittleSongbird,Silly and routine but fun,7,22 December 2011,"I saw Shanghai Noon because I do like Jackie Chan, and the premise seemed like the film would be a winner. Although I didn't find Shanghai Noon particularly special, it was a fun movie and I would recommend it.The plot is routine, with some of the ideas a tad forced. The film also feels 5 or so minutes too long, one or two scenes in the middle felt like they could have been shortened. Lucy Liu isn't given much to do either.However, the film is beautifully shot and the scenery and sets are equally ravishing. There is also a rousing score from Randy Eldemann, a smart script with some amusing if not hilarious jokes and sharply choreographed fight scenes. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are both very good, and are a well matched double act.Overall, not perfect, but fun and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Shanghai Noon
1,Leofwine_draca,Likable comedy action vehicle with the right balance of ingredients,6,16 December 2016,"Yet more of the amiable buddy-buddy action comedy staple from the newly Americanised Jackie Chan, who seems to base every American movie on the template created in RUSH HOUR. Martial arts buffs and fans of Chan will undoubtedly find this a pleasant enough viewing experience, with a fast paced plot that takes in just about all of the old Western clichés: I'm talking cowboys, native Americans, slaves working at a mine, the bar-room brawl, tons of prostitutes, the jailbreak, the showdown, plus lots more besides. Superficially, the film is a pleasure to watch, with great photography at a number of key moments and stunning attention to detail in terms of sets and costumes. The only thing out of place is the bizarre music the film uses, which tends to be towards the 'grating' end of the scale.Fans of Chan, however, will find him getting further and further away from the heights his career reached in the mid to late 1980s. I'm talking about classics such as ARMOUR OF GOD and POLICE STORY. As Chan gets older, we begin to notice some of his stunts are digitally created, stuntmen are starting to pop up, and the various fight sequences just don't last as long as they used to. Don't get me wrong – there are still plenty of cool martial arts battles on display here – it's just that they seem to get fewer and further apart with only flashes of the occasional brilliance that Chan has come to be known for.The comedy aspect of the film is high, trading mainly on the comic interplay between the extreme characters. Chan actually manages to be irritating a few times here with his overacting whilst his newest foil, laidback sidekick Owen Wilson, is a taste that one definitely needs to get to grips with. At least he is far less annoying than RUSH HOUR's Chris Tucker, which has to be a good thing. The supporting cast is pretty strong – Lucy Liu is remarkable but underused as the princess, and one of my favourite supporting role actors, Xander Berkeley actually gets a GOOD role for a change as the mean sheriff, Nathan Van Cleef. Roger Yuan is sufficiently imposing and skilled athletically to provide menace as the villain of the piece, whilst there are plenty of comedic supporting players to enjoy.The balance between comedy and action seems to be pretty spot on, but this is a kind of film where the laughs make you smile occasionally rather than laugh out loud. The same effect is true of the action sequences – they're cool and engaging, but none of them are truly spectacular or mind-boggling like they used to be in the old days. I guess we can at least be thankful that Chan is still around to provide half-decent entertainment which at worst makes us feel nostalgic for his older days. Good luck to him. A sequel, SHANGHAI KNIGHTS, followed in 2003. Incidentally, this is the newest addition to the strange sub-genre of films, the Eastern Western. Following on from the success of THE FIGHTING FISTS OF SHANGHAI JOE in the early '70s, other notable examples include TIGER ON THE RIVER KWAI, BLOOD MONEY, and KUNG FU BROTHERS IN THE WILD WEST.",Shanghai Noon
2,SnoopyStyle,good comedic duo in kung fu western,8,23 May 2015,"Imperial guard Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is in love with Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu). She runs away from an arranged marriage but instead she's taken for ransom to America by traitor Lo Fong. Three guards are sent to pay the ransom and Chon Wang begs to join the expedition. In Nevada, they encounter train robber Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and his gang. Wang and O'Bannon are forced together when Wallace takes over the gang and later O'Bannon is found cheating at cards.Killing the uncle is probably not a good way to start the partnership. There are plenty of ways to better start the duo on their path together. That's really my only complaint. The comedy is sometimes broad like a hilarious Blazing Saddles scene. Jackie Chan is hilarious. Owen Wilson brings out his devilish charms. The old west is a great place for Jackie Chan to discover new props for his action scenes. The guys are a great comedy duo and there are plenty of big laughs.",Shanghai Noon
3,classicsoncall,"""John Wayne..., that's a terrible cowboy name!""",7,13 November 2008,"As a fan of movie Westerns, I got the biggest kick every time a reference was made or an homage paid to characters and films that had gone before. Most obvious of course is the title knock off of genre favorite ""High Noon"", and it just keeps building from there. Chon Wang/John Wayne was a hoot, along with the very obvious naming of the bad guy sheriff after high profile character actor Lee Van Cleef. Then there's the bit where Jackie Chan's horse does the gimmick with the blanket, something I'd seen done before by no less notable equine stars as Roy Rogers' Trigger and Tonto's Scout in pictures going back to the early 1950's. Above all, I couldn't help noticing in scene after scene how much Owen Wilson looked like Redford's Sundance Kid, so much so that I could almost picture him as Paul Newman's sidekick in that 1969 film, except Wilson couldn't even come close as an actor. Which is OK if you're going for the over the top kind of comedy that this one does, but then you have to be prepared for mixed results. By that I'm thinking about scenes like the drunken hot tub splish splash that would have been alright if done just once, but got to be tedious after just the second time. There were just too many moments like that one that seemed to interfere with the flow of the story. Brandon Merrill had the thankless task of Chon Wang's Indian wife, who seemed to pop up from time to time to let us know she was around, but without any real connection to the story. So she came through with a save near the end of the picture, but why do the flip flop for Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) as Chon Wang pairs off with the Princess (Lucy Liu)? Not very realistic or believable, especially on the part of the women. I would expect a Chinese princess to have more class than that, and an Indian maiden would certainly have had more discipline.But let's face it, you go into a Jackie Chan film for the martial arts choreography and innovative fight scenes, so on that score, this one delivers. Hard to imagine how you could incorporate trees and moose antlers into a fight routine, but Jackie does it with style. I'd like to know if you could expend all that energy beating up on six Crow warriors and still remain standing, but I think we all know that answer - it's a movie.Say, I noticed something that made me curious relative to a street sign in Carson City in the latter part of the picture. You could only make out a portion of the message that stated 'Bulldog Drummond's '. So I did a quick google to learn that Bulldog Drummond's first literary appearance occurred in a 1920 novel. That would have been quite the feat to predict his existence approximately forty years into the future from the story's setting in 1881. Somehow I don't think Chong Wang and O'Bannon needed the help of a fictional British detective.",Shanghai Noon
4,lee_eisenberg,The west just keeps getting wilder and wilder!,10,15 March 2006,"Basically the same sort of thing as the rest of Jackie Chan's movies, only this one casts him as Chinese imperial guard Chon Wang, who has to rescue Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) in the Old West. That's the plot, but of course, the movie is really an excuse to show off Chan's fighting skills. Adding to everything is Owen Wilson as bank robber Roy O'Bannon, who keeps getting himself into embarrassing situations.One really funny scene is when Chon's cohorts are traveling with a pioneer family who gets ROYALLY confused about the men's ethnicity! Overall, maybe ""Shanghai Noon"" doesn't add anything major to the cinematic landscape, but that's not the purpose here! We're here to see Jackie Chan pull his stunts. And boy does he! A comedy classic.",Shanghai Noon
5,jboothmillard,Shanghai Noon,5,7 December 2008,"Imagine Rush Hour (martial arts) mixed with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (outlaw cowboy), and that gives you an idea of what to expect with this fun to watch western action comedy, from director Tom Dey (Failure to Launch). Basically it is the 19th Century, and Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped from her the Forbidden City in her home country, and it is the strict duty and personal responsibility of Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) to get her back, well, with the other three guys, but forget them. On his journey in Nevada, in the U.S., he meets outlaw cowboy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), originally a near bad guy, with no like of violence or anything nasty, but he is soon finding himself wanting to help his new ""partner"". Oh, by the way, the bad guy is Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), a traitor of Wang's home country, and he is obviously wanting a priceless amount of gold as ransom. Also starring Brandon Merrill as Indian wife, Candyman's Xander Berkeley as Van Cleef, Walton Goggins as Wallace, Adrien P. Dorval as Blue, Rafael Báez as Vasquez and Jason Connery as Andrews. Chan gets his stunts and fighting sequences, and Wilson gets his witty dialogue and gun play, and Liu gets to look glamorous, in a pretty entertaining film. Worth watching!",Shanghai Noon
6,ccthemovieman-1,A Winner For Jackie Chan,8,20 April 2006,"It seems this film has been out longer than just six years but I remember it was one of the first modern-day humorous martial arts films to be seen in North America. It also introduced a much wider English- speaking audience to the charm and talents of Asian star Jackie Chan, who now is well-known everywhere, even if he is getting up in age.This is considered one of Chan's better films and the setting certainly is different than normal for him: the American Old West. Good action scenes, some solid humor, fun characters and nice cinematography are all the pluses. Chan speaks English so there is no need for dubbing, either. The only ""minus"" I found was the final action scene going on too long, but that's typical of films. All in all, this is a very entertaining movie. Owen Wlson and Lucy Liu also are two big reasons this film became so popular.",Shanghai Noon
7,Tweekums,East meets west in this comedy Western,8,6 October 2017,"When Princess Pei Pei is lured out of China's Forbidden City and taken to America and held for ransom three top Imperial Guards are sent to retrieve her. Chon Wang, a less than top guard also asks to go as he blames himself for her kidnapping. Once in America their train is ambushed by gangsters led by Roy O'Bannon. As a result of this Chon ends up off the train and Roy separates from his gang. Inevitably Chon and Roy soon meet again and end up forming an unlikely alliance; even if Chon is motivated by trying to rescue the princess and Roy is keener to get his hands on the gold intended to pay her ransom. If they are to save her they will have to deal with her kidnapper, a former Imperial Guard, and a corrupt sheriff who is determined to kill them both.This East meets West comedy western is a lot of fun as it plays with classic Western and kung-fu tropes in an amusing way. Jackie Chan is a great lead as he is naturally funny and more than has the skills required for the action scenes. Owen Wilson offers fine support; he too is funny and makes his character likable. While not on screen anywhere near as much Lucy Liu impresses as the spirited princess. A film like this needs good villains and it has two in the form of Roger Yuan and Xander Berkeley. There is plenty of exciting action; none of it too strong though; it is usually more slapstick than violent. There are lots of laughs to be had; these are a good mix of visual gags as well as witty dialogue. Overall I'd say if you enjoy Westerns and want a good laugh you could do a lot worse than this.",Shanghai Noon
8,ma-cortes,Agreeable and sympathetic Western-comedy movie with a likable and fun duo,6,24 September 2007,"The film is developed in the Forbidden City , Being , 1881 , and begins when the Chinese princess (Luci Liu) is kidnapped by the villain Fong (Yuan) and asking for a rescue . A faithful servant named Wang (Jackie Chan) follows the tracks until Nevada, and along the way he teams up with a roguish gunfighter (Owen Wilson). Once in the West they will confront Indians , a treacherous sheriff (Xander Berkeley) and perfidious Chinese people.The motion picture displays Western action , humor with tongue-in-cheek , spectacular struggles in Jackie Chan style and results to be pretty funny. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson create an enjoyable and amusing couple . The highlights of the movie are the breathtaking movements executed by Jackie Chan himself , as he goes into action with his kicks , bounds and leaps . It's usual in Chan movies to form enjoyable duos , -in buddy movie style- , as male partner : Chris Tucker (Rush hour I, II and III) , as female: Jennifer Love Hewitt (The Tuxedo) and Claire Forlani (The medallion) and this one to pair off splendidly with Owen Wilson . Furthermore, Chan owns a funny horse, Jolly Jumper-alike from Lucky Luke series . The movie gets a glimmer cinematography and appropriate music score accompanying to action by Randy Edelman , composer along with Trevor Jones , of the classic soundtrack for ¨The last Mohican¨. The film was well directed by Tom Day and followed by a inferior sequel : ¨Shanghai knights¨ , set in 1887, London , where our two friends recover a valuable royal jewel robbed in the forbidden city.",Shanghai Noon
9,Quinoa1984,Under-rated entertainer,7,26 July 2000,"In 1998, Rush Hour made a lot of money thanks to Jackie Chan's action and Chris Tucker's comedy.  This time around, we don't have Chris Tucker, but have a good enough substitute, Owen Wilson.  The plot takes Jackie Chan as a imperial guard who must rescue a princess who has been kidnapped in the 19th century (Nevada).  But on his way, he meets a western type of guy (Wilson) who tries to teach him the ropes without that much luck.  Very entertaining action and comedy, but somehow looked over in this summer of 2000 by such over-raters as M:I2 and The Patriot (Not that they are bad).  A fun movie for anybody.  A",Shanghai Noon
10,michaelRokeefe,East meets west. Jackie Chan rides low in the saddle.,7,21 April 2001,"This is a very funny parody of the classic westerns we grew up with. Plenty of action and countless random acts of comedy. Chon Wang(Jackie Chan)represents the Chinese Imperial Guard, as he travels to 1821 Nevada to rescue Princess Pei Pei(Lucy Liu). Out of place Wang runs into a bumbling train robber Roy O'Bannon(Owen Wilson), who tries to school the pigtailed Chinaman in the arts of being a cowboy. The reluctant partners run into tight situations on their way to finding the princess.Chan is outstanding combining his comedic wit with manic martial arts. Wilson seems like a preppy drugstore cowboy hung out to dry. His lame character is also a big source of the movie's humor. Supporting cast includes:Xander Berkeley, Brandon Merrill, Walt Goggins and Jason Connery.Sit back and be prepared to laugh. Nothing here to think about, just relaxing entertainment.",Shanghai Noon
11,hitchcockthelegend,He even has a cool sounding name!.,7,28 January 2009,"A loyal Imperial Guard sets off to America to rescue a kidnapped Princess that he serves in China. After the train he is on is robbed by Outlaws, and his uncle is killed, a set of circumstances will put the guard in the company of a rapscallion cowboy named Roy O'Bannon, to form an unlikely a duo as you are ever likely to see.Laden with Cowboy clichés and trumpeting that it is a West meets the East fish out of water shenanigan, Shanghai Noon could so easily have been a film to roll your eyes up to heaven with. Thankfully it turns out to be a non pretentious, non moralistic mess that entertains those looking for a comedy that just wants to cheer you up. Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (say that real fast to get the joke) opens up his bag of martial arts joviality and impresses as much as he amuses (check out the horse shoe set piece). While Owen Wilson as O'Bannon leaves behind some previous stinker pictures, to engage us royally as a comedy actor and provide us with dynamite chemistry playing off the charming wonder of Chan (the sequel was inevitable). With both men clearly happy to run with it and let each one share the limelight.It's a positive delight is what it is, blustering set pieces go hand in hand with cheeky in-jokes and Western genre standards, whilst the end credit out takes are some of the funniest out there. Highly recommended viewing to those in need of a pick me up and to those who know that sometimes harmless fun can be a cinematic treat. 7/10",Shanghai Noon
12,Boba_Fett1138,Very childish and weak comedy.,4,10 December 2008,"Even though the movie is rated PG-13, it's a very childish and simple movie that is aimed toward the young viewers. It's comedy and story is totally predictable and thus offers very little fun and originality.I'm actually quite fond of movies that try to mix some very unlikely genres together. I however guess that mixing western with material arts wasn't a very good idea. It really doesn't look and feel right. As a movie that is set for most part in the wild west, it also is a far too clean looking movie. It has bright colors and actors with perfect shining teeth.I like Jackie Chan but not really as much in his Hollywood work. He's acting and accent are far too lacking for that and even his comical and fighting skills don't really shine within this movie, even though there are still a couple of nice fighting sequences within the movie. Most of the comedy from this movie needs to come from Owen Wilson, who however isn't given the best material to work with. No, as a comedy this movie is simply too lacking, fore it's far too childish, totally predictable and just plain weak at parts. The only thing this movie is really funny in is with its characters names, that of course reference to some classic western actors and real life persons.This movie was actually Owen Wilson's 'big' comedy breakthrough. Before this he also played some slightly comical roles but more in some 'serious' movies, such as ""Armageddon"", ""The Haunting"" and ""Anaconda"". Lucy Liu is also in this somewhere but she gets far too little to do. Same goes for Xander Berkeley, who seemed like a potentially interesting villain.Here lies another problem of the movie. Characters just come and just as easily go within this movie. It really isn't very consistent and its confusing who is going to be for instance the main villain, the love interest, etcetera. The movie feels messy because of this and it made it actually quite annoying to watch at times, also since the story is being so formulaic and therefore totally predictable.Just a weak, annoying and childish comedy. Not sure why it's currently being rated so high. I hate these Hollywood type of immature comedies/buddy flicks.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Shanghai Noon
13,view_and_review,"West Good, East Bad",4,31 December 2020,"Apparently, China has been an oppressive place for years (except when they were under the military thumb of Japan). It is so bad that Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) would rather flee to America and be a commoner than be royalty back home.That's how our movie starts: Princess Pei Pei gets seduced by the idea of 19th century America and decides to escape her palace and go west, except the westerner taking her to the ""land of the free"" was working in concert with a bad guy looking to use the princess to extort gold from the emperor. Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and four other royal guards went to retrieve the princess with 100,000 pieces of gold.In America Wang hooked up with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) where he taught him all about being an American: being independent, being your own man, getting the girl, blah blah blah. The two of them eventually save the princess who was doing what many Chinese were doing at that time; being forced to build railroads. Yet the princess is so much in service to her people that even after experiencing being in a forced labor camp she decided to stay as if she were going to somehow rescue her people. The only thing worse would be an African princess picking tobacco in North Carolina and still preferring 19th century America over... well, over any place.This script was lame and the dynamic between Chan and Wilson was feeble. Wilson is not funny, yet he had the lion's share of the lines. The more he spoke the more annoying he became. I think the didactic west-good, east-bad story dug a hole for this movie and Owen Wilson buried it.",Shanghai Noon
14,anaconda-40658,The Leads Sweat It Out.,6,16 June 2015,"Shanghai Noon (2000): Dir: Tom Dey / Cast: Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Xander Berkeley, Brandon Merrill: Comedy about the collision of two cultures. We have Jackie Chan as an Imperial guard in China as well as Owen Wilson as an amateur train robber who is betrayed by his gang. Chan is on a quest to Carson City to rescue a Princess kidnapped by a traitor. The rest involves a series of mishaps as Chan and Wilson become wanted criminals. Simple and predictable with a lot of action and stunts. Directing debut for Tom Dey who does a fine job at combining the two genres into one comic centerpiece. Chan and Wilson provide great comic chemistry. Chan is out in search of answers and justice while Wilson fumbles through life attaching to anything and anyone who will listen. It is unfortunate that they will wind down to an action climax that halts everything. Lucy Liu is unfortunately working with standard material as the Princess. She had great potential to rise above this due to her celebrity status but remain sheltered in stereotypes here. Xander Berkeley is also featured among notable casting but nothing in supporting roles is very broad. This film purely belongs to the leads and thankfully their chemistry propel the film beyond being what would be consider pitiful in lesser hands. The result is a mediocre yet enjoyable comedy about two cultures and two genres. Score: 6 / 10",Shanghai Noon
15,Wuchakk,Entertaining action/comedy Western,7,28 August 2013,"Released in 2000, ""Shanghai Noon"" features Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (the Chinese spelling of John Wayne) who teams up with good bad-guy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). They're pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures.It didn't dawn on me until the end that the title ""Shanghai Noon"" is a comical take on ""High Noon"" (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you're in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999's ""The Mummy."" It's not as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it's better than its sequels.Chan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is amusing, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end. Of course, with Jackie Chan the action is great as well, but it goes a bit overboard towards the end, which is typical of Hollywood, as well as overlong.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, and the Forbidden City, Beijing.GRADE: B",Shanghai Noon

I have seen so many reditions of this type of film, over and over and over again, that it looks like a by the book 80'S movie.  Go see Beverly Hills cop and you can understand the principle.  Anyways, this fish out of water flick is over kill. They try and chance the story line with a social message thinly put in. Problem is we also seen this in every 90's movie made, over and over and over.  By the number bad guys, and disagrement by the lead actors, a predictable ending.

17,SimonJack,"Fair Chan action film with dated, humorless comedy",5,18 May 2021,"""Shanghai Noon"" is an action comedy film that stars Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. I saw this film in the theater when it came out, but watching it again recently it had lost most of the comedy. What little comedy there was in the first place didn't even get a chuckle this time. So, on reflection after a 20-year lapse, it seems that that time around the turn of the century had several comedy films of this type made. What they are is a modern attempt at Laurel and Hardy.But it doesn't work in this film. Jackie Chan's bits of humor in his action sequences, including the miscues, are okay and some are good. But those are easily overlooked in the efforts to make Owen Wilson's part funny. Quite simply put, he isn't funny at all in this film. The script attempts at comedy for Wilson are lame.Chan's action scenarios are the best thing about this film, and really the only reason to see it. But even those aren't on the level of his earlier films that were made in Hong Kong. And, a little plus goes for the settings and the scenes of the Forbidden City. It looks much like the Forbidden City that I recall from a hiking and walking tour of China in 2001.",Shanghai Noon

You get your Jackie Chan moves with your fun humor and inaccurate history. But just have fun I would say. I'm sorry, I really can't come up with anything else because this is a typical film. Just like a dictionary; look up Rush Hour. Same plot, different time, different actors. I would recommend Rush Hour, Lethal Weapon, or any other buddy/cop movies.

20,MovieAddict2016,One of the most enjoyable lightweight entertainments in years!,9,11 January 2004,"Pairing Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson together may seem the most unlikely thing to do since color televisions were first invented. But both of these actors are funny, in one way or another--Chan through his innocence, Wilson through his sarcastic, snide remarks. Wilson is as impressive an actor as he is a writer--he shares writing credits on such films as ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""Chan, on the other hand, is a better martial arts master than Jet Li and a more likable character actor than Chow Yun Fat (whose disastrous film ""Bulletproof Monk"" made me want to split his head open to prevent him from ever making another American mainstream motion picture ever again).In ""Shanghai Noon,"" Chan plays Chon Wang, a 19th century Chinese martial arts master who ventures out to Nevada in order to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), whose name is misused by Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) on at last one occasion.After Chon Wang (mistakenly pronounced ""John Wayne"") meets up with Roy, the two decide to form an alliance and rescue the princess -- one for honor, the other for loads of money awaiting them upon her safe arrival back home in Imperial China's Forbidden City.Roy is a lousy wannabe cowboy who used to stage clumsy train robberies along with his band of thieves, who betrayed him and left him for dead. He offers his help to Wang, and tries to play it cool, but he can't -- after all, he's not a very convincing cowboy. But, as the smarmy wisecracking sidekicks always are, O'Bannon just wants money. But as his friendship with Chan grows stronger, he realizes that money isn't everything.Sounds routine, doesn't it? Well, it is, to a certain extent. But it succeeds due to a fine cast -- Chan and Wilson are extraordinarily good together; so good, in fact, that Chris Tucker is just a forgotten memory by the time that the film is over.It's a classic spin on the Old West formula; what ""The Princess Bride"" or ""Shrek"" did for fairy tales, ""Shanghai Noon"" does for Westerns. All the old cliches are poked fun at in a light way. And as great as Chan is, and as much as he carries most films he's in with his sweet charms and likable personas, Wilson comes across as equally likable as Chan.Chan's martial arts are usually the highlights of these films, but in this he proves he can do more than just kick -- he can be funny. Well, okay, he proved that in ""Rush Hour"" (1998), but I like this better.The jokes in ""Shanghai Noon"" aren't ""great,"" but I laughed a lot at this film. It's smarter than one might think, and is certainly one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in quite some time. Probably years. I wasn't expecting much (especially because I wasn't an enormous fan of the sequel--see below), but if fun could be rated on a scale of 1 - 10, this would be an 11.I give this film nothing more than four out of five stars because it's not a great film on all critical levels. But it's certainly fun--likely more fun than any film you'll see for quite some time--and for that it will soon be earning a place in my sacred DVD collection.I must say that I wasn't a huge fan of ""Shanghai Knights,"" the sequel to ""Shanghai Noon,"" which involved Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon venturing to England in order to save Wang's sister. But after seeing this film I'm thinking I might just have to pay a small revisit the sequel again.

21,OllieSuave-007,When East meets West...,7,18 March 2014,"Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson star in a 19th century Western, where Imperial Guard Chon Wang (Chan) of China's Forbidden City attempt to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) in the United States. There, he meets small time robber Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and together they go through misadventures, until they finally band together to find the Princess and rescue her people.This is basically a good old fashion western comedy featuring Chan's signature martial arts moves and Wilson's mellow and friendly attitude yearning for grandeur. You put the two characters together and you'll get a love-hate friendship and partnership that is mildly entertaining to watch.The plot is quick-paced, helped by the story's many adventures and fast action from the characters. The clash between the east and west cultures and stereotypes are amusing and harmless enough to keep the film interesting. Lots of slapstick humor and whimsical jokes from the cast, especially Chan and Wilson, mixed in with some heroic action and courageous drama. It's not Oscar material, but it's loads of fun.Grade B",Shanghai Noon
22,sddavis63,An Enjoyable Ride As Imperial China Meets The Old West,6,24 April 2001,"Let's get the unimportant stuff out of the way first. The story revolves around 19th century Chinese Imperial Guardsman Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) sent to America to rescue a Princess (Lucy Liu) who has been kidnapped and taken to Carson City, Nevada (!?), where she's being held for a ransom of gold. Now, forget about all that. The story is really secondary, and only serves as an excuse for some decent martial arts action (which nevertheless doesn't, thankfully, take over, and for some frivolity between Chan and Owen Wilson (playing the outlaw Roy O'Bannon, with whom Chon Wang teams up.)There are some decent enough laughs here (I especially liked the drinking game O'Bannon plays with Chon while in the bathtub), and you have to give some credit to a movie that allows you to fall asleep for ten minutes (I confess that I did) and pick right up without feeling as if you've missed a beat. (At the same time the wordplay on Chon Wang/John Wayne got very old very fast.)Lucy Liu was, I thought, unfortunately underused. She was extremely well cast (mind you, that was probably not difficult since there are not exactly scores of young, attractive Chinese actresses in Hollywood.) Liu possesses a mysterious and exotic beauty that lends itself to the image of royalty, but she wasn't really given very much to do in a movie that revolved around Chan and Wilson.By all means take a look at this. It's enjoyable, funny, has plenty of action. Not a classic by any means, but I still rated it 6/10",Shanghai Noon

24,g-bodyl,I Love Jackie Chan!,9,26 October 2010,"Jackie Chan is one of the great kung fu stars to step on the Hollywood stage. I liked every American movie Chan has made and this is no exception. Shanghai Noon actually made be one of his best. There is a great mixture of comedy and action combined. Unlike the somewhat annoying Chris Tucker, Owen Wilson makes a great sidekick to Chan.This takes place in the Old West. Chan is sent from China to rescue the kidnapped Princess. Along the way, he become partners with a train robber. Together, they face the challenges of the Old West in many hilarious ways.Overall, this is a wonderful movie with great music, crazy stunts, and good ol' comedy. My favorite scene was the forced marriage between Chan and the Native American girl. I rate this film 9/10.",Shanghai Noon
25,lesleyharris30,"A Lot of Fun with Great Chemistry between its Two Leads,",8,21 August 2015,"Shanghai Noon is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very fun movie that contains many scenes that had me laughing out loud, as well as several surprisingly intense and very well choreographed action sequences, it's a clever mix of both westerns and martial arts films, and it is clear watching this from start to finish that it is a unique film. I only have two major problems with this movie, and that is that it takes itself too seriously at times, it gets fairly deep for something that should have only wanted to be a comedy, particularly the scenes with the princess and her capturers are quite dark and grim, and I also felt like it needed much more moments between Chan and Wilson's characters that conveyed a friendship is beginning, I would have liked to see a lot more scenes with the two of them together simply having fun and not worrying about the problem they must overcome. The highlight of the movie and the thing that certainly holds it all together would have to be Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, they are an unlikely duo, but this works out perfectly, the chemistry between the two is outstanding and the drinking game is definitely my favourite scene in the whole movie. Funny, action packed and entertaining, I would recommend Shanghai Noon to anyone looking for a good adventure film. A Chinese imperial guard teams up with a train robber in order to rescue a kidnapped princess. Best Performance: Owen Wilson",Shanghai Noon
26,CuriosityKilledShawn,So Light It Floats,5,11 May 2004,"There's a fair amount of fun to be had with this film. It doesn't take itself seriously or bother going too deep. The tone is bright and happy and it makes for perfect mindless entertainment. But nothing else. Seriously, there is no need to watch this more than once as it is the most forgetable pile of utter silliness in a long time.Owen Wilson is so charming as the hapless but innocent crook Roy O'Bannon who teams up Jackie Chan's Chong Wang/John Wayne to put an evil Sheriff out of business, rescue a Princess and defeat some stock Chinese Bad Guy. It's all harmless stuff with some neat fight scenes that never get too violent and a gleefully light-hearted sense of humor.Randy Edelman's generic Western score is terrible (as usual) and sounds like everything else he's ever done only with a few notes changed. But it's the only weak part of a thoroughly indifferent, inoffensive and passive movie.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.",Shanghai Noon

All the characters are fantastic, and i found the setting really cool, plus Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are simply amazing in this!. It had some great fight scenes, and Jackie and Owen are absolutely hilarious together, and have wonderful chemistry together, plus i thought the finale was awesome!.One of the funniest scenes in the movie for me was Jackie's drinking game that had me in stitches, and i thought Xander Berkeley and Roger Yuan were fantastic as the main villains, and were quite menacing, plus Lucy Liu was great in her role!. I thought Jackie's fight scenes were great, and i don't know how Jackie kept a straight face around Owen Wilson, plus the ending was fantastic!. I was kind of skeptical about this paring, however it surprisingly worked extremely well, plus, the shootout was really cool. This is excellent fun all around, with tons of laughs, and lots of action, Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson made a wonderful pair, and i say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is great!. Tom Dey does a great job here, with awesome camera work, great angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is fantastic!. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious, had wonderful chemistry with Owen Wilson, kicked that ass, seemed to be enjoying himself, and had a really cool character! (Jackie Rules!!). Owen Wilson is wonderful here, he is downright hilarious, extremely likable, had wonderful chemistry with Jackie, had some fantastic lines, and like Jackie was tons of fun to watch! (Owen Rules!). Lucy Liu is gorgeous, and does excellent with what she had to do, although i wished she had more screen time. Roger Yuan is great as one of the main villains, and was quite menacing. Xander Berkeley hammed it up big time,as the other main villain and was quite fun to watch, i liked him lots. Walton Goggins does his job well as the dummy. Rest of the cast do fine.

28,The-Sarkologist,"Fun, but not like Chan's Hong Kong Films.",6,11 September 2020,"This is one of those films that Jackie Chan made when he made the transition from Hong Kong cinema to American Cinema, and in a way it does sort of feel like one of his traditional films, though it has a much more American flavour to it. The reason being is that he has done a number of period pieces back when he was in Hong Kong, and Project A does come to mind (though I'm not sure if he did any where he was an Imperial guard for the emperor). However, the major difference, other than having a lot of Americanisms, is that it does tend to be pretty polished, something that you generally don't get from Hong Kong cinema (which isn't actually a bad thing).So, the film is basically a Western, though unlike a lot of Westerns where the Asian character is just a sidekick and there is no real backstory to him, this film flips it around. Mind you, we do have Owen Wilson taking this concept of him being the hero, but one of the things we notice in this film is that Chon Wang (Chan's character, and the name is supposed to be a play on John Wayne) is actually more of a hero than Roy O'Bannon happens to be, though of course Wang is humble enough to just let O'Bannon be who he claims to be.Mind you, while they try to be a little bit more authentic when it comes to Wang's character, they simply use the staples of the Native Americans. Like, this whole idea that the peace pipe is filled with some intoxicant that they smoke around the campfire for fun is, well, completely wrong - it's just tobacco, and they only used it on special occasions. Yeah, while they try not to create stereotypes around the Asian characters, they end up doing it with the Indians.Of course the film also plays on the fact that America is land of the free, and draws some huge distinctions with the authoritarian nature of Imperial China (something that I suspect they won't be doing these days, since China has become such a huge market for American films, and many of them self-censor so as to hopefully get one of the converted spots).The story is fun though. It's about a Chinese princess who is kidnapped and taken to the United States, though of course there isn't much of an indication as to why, except to get money off of the Emperor. The story is mostly about Wang's quest across the American West to find her, and of course the prejudices and adventures that he happens to have along the way. Of course it wouldn't be a Jackie Chan movie if there wasn't any action scenes, and stunts, and yeah, there are plenty of them. Still, there is just some charm about his Hong Kong films that just isn't replicated here.",Shanghai Noon
29,slightlymad22,Jackie Chan and the guy from Armageddon have fun in the west,7,27 July 2014,"Jackie Chan's new action comedy, Westerns, martial arts and buddy movie is stolen by an excellent performance by Owen Wilson.China, the Forbidden City, 1881. The princess (A wasted Lucy Liu) who hates her life is kidnapped and held for ransom in Nevada. The three best imperial guards are selected to rescue her. Chan goes along as a he feels responsible (as he failed stop top her)In Nevada, Chan teams up with a train robber named Roy O'Bannon (Wilson), and they rescue the princess with much help from a hot Indian maiden (The actress is called Brandon Merrill and she is hot).The plot, of course, is only used to get us from one of Chan's Chaplin-esque martial arts sequences to the next, with Wilson's very funny verbal quips. Material like this can be very very bad. Here it is sort of wonderful, mainly helped by Chan's likability and effortless charm and the performance by Wilson. His comic timing is precise, and his character is very hard to dislike.Chan's character is (As in every American movie he has made to date since the Burt Reynolds led Cannonball Run in 1980) a man of limited vocabulary and much action. Most moviegoers didn't know who Owen Wilson was when this was released. Most people only remembered him from 'Armageddon' after racking their brains, This movie should have made him an A list star. He is too smart and versatile to be packaged within a narrow range tho and he followed this up with Meet The Parents, Zoolander, Royal Tenebaums, Behind Enemy Lines and I Spy before 2003's sequel to this movie. Liu, as the princess, is completely under used, until the final act where she becomes a damsel in distress, a brave and plucky one, but a damsel in distress non the less. Not so boldly portrayed is Merrill's Indian woman,(My God is she hot. It's a shame she has not had an acting role prior or since this movie) who is married to Chans character in a ceremony that nobody seems to take seriously and that the movie itself has clearly forgotten all about by the time the last shot comes around.",Shanghai Noon
30,poe426,The frontier was never funnier...,10,13 September 2002,"Beautifully directed send-up, with Jumpin' Jackie Chan at his absolute funniest. For purists, there are stunts aplenty, but it's the give-and-take between Chan and co-star Owen Wilson that makes this one Chan's finest. I was one of those early converts who waited DECADES to see Jackie Chan make an ""American comedy."" While RUSH HOUR had its moments, it also had Chris Tucker (and, if you can stomach his Michael Jackson schtick, you're a better man than I am- or will ever be). This time around, he's teamed with someone who's capable of giving as good as he gets. Good writing helps. Chan is the modern Chaplin (pun intended; Chaplin fans, please take note). If you're one of those fence-sitters who hasn't yet taken the plunge, this is the best jumping-off point. Check out Jackie Chan. You can thank me later.",Shanghai Noon
31,funkyfry,Pleasing comedy actioner,6,15 December 2008,"I can't really rate or comment on this film negatively, even though it's a movie almost completely devoid of originality and ideas. Basically this is a formula buddy movie, typical of Jackie Chan's work both here and in China in that it involves elaborate stuntwork, kung-fu with props, and humorous characters and situations. I don't usually bother with Chan's American films since he already made better ones in China, but I wanted to see this one because I've always liked Owen Wilson and I wanted to see how they worked together. Happily I can report that I was pleased greatly with their chemistry, enough so that I might even bother to seek out the sequel at some point.The story is like a comedy variation on the old movie ""Red Sun"" with Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune, except that in this case the Asian hero is Chinese and the object they are seeking is not a precious ceremonial sword but rather the princess of China herself (Lucy Liu). Liu is the weak link in the film if there is one... she doesn't seem to have much talent for comedy, although the film didn't give her too many chances to show it off. Much more interesting is Native American model Brandon Merrill, who made her only film appearance here as the gorgeous and strong-willed woman who takes Chan's character (who her people refer to as ""fights in a dress"") as a husband.There are some fun moments that come at us, and the film's pace is breezy and light. I liked Wilson and Chan's drinking scene, and the ensuing fight gives Chan an opportunity to revive his much-admired ""drunken master"" technique. Wilson and Chan make a good pairing because Wilson is so incredibly low-key and Chan is so amazingly high-strung. They're the kind of opposites that always attract, and all the story and other characters are really just trappings for the chemistry they develop.For all that the film does have going for it, it simply lacks a few really outrageous laugh-out-loud moments that could have put it over the top.",Shanghai Noon
32,Anonymous_Maxine,"This isn't the east, Chon, it's the west. You should know, you've done this before!",5,27 May 2000,"Jackie Chan returns to do yet another east meets west routine, virtually identical to that in Rush Hour, just in a different time period. As far as its story, Shanghai Noon is completely unoriginal, but the laughs are surprisingly abundant, thanks in large part to the crooked-nosed Owen Wilson. Chan and Wilson make an amusing comic duo, and one of the film's strong points is the fact that it takes a tired story and delivers it in an interesting and entertaining way. However, there was also an overabundance of the manipulation of reality that was difficult to overlook. (possible spoilers ahead!!) For example, Chon Wang's almost immediate acceptance into the Indian tribe, and then the daughter's seemingly effortless divorce of Chan and elopement with Roy O'Bannon. Don't Indians frown on divorce? I also liked how Roy's newfound Indian love suddenly spoke fluent English at the end of the movie. The character's names removed any possibility of taking this film at all seriously (particularly Chon Wang and Princess Pei Pei), and the exaggerated kung fu fighting on Chan's part trapped this film indefinitely in the category of ""Another Jackie Chan Film."" However, it was good for a few laughs, and it is always fun to watch Chan beat up a bunch of villains who ridiculously outnumber him, but I get the feeling that this film may be forgotten even faster than Wild Wild West.",Shanghai Noon
33,Vartiainen,Shallow brainless giggles,3,30 January 2014,"I will preface this by saying that I'm really picky when it comes to comedies. That being said, this movie right here seems to think that it's enough to shove a funny stereotype in our faces and then expect us to laugh at it uproariously.I liked this film as an action/adventure film. Jackie Chan is a great martial art lead actor and his talents are showcased well in this film. It's not one of the best he has ever done, but the fight scenes are fun to follow, they're imaginative enough to keep up my interest and the settings have some promise and allow for some cool sequences. Furthermore, the West is filmed with care and all the various locations, while hardly original, look nice and feel genuine.Unfortunately the script is nonsensical, from oneshot characters that make no sense to plot motives and twists that come straight out of nowhere and steal all thunder out of the film. The plot itself is thin to begin with, but when every major conflict is resolved through either a deus ex machina or a cop-out, you get the idea that they really didn't give a damn as long as they could fill the screen with cheap gimmicks and laughs.The humour doesn't help either. There are some scenes that are honestly funny or at least amusing, most of the between Chan and Wilson, who have surprisingly good chemistry together, but most of the jokes are either mindless slapstick or racial stereotypes. Sure, a Chinaman can be funny if done correctly, but a Chinaman alone is not funny by default. Neither is a coward, a Mexican or an Indian. You need actual effort, which this film is unwilling to spend.If you're able to laugh at cheap jokes and clichés, this is not a bad action comedy. Chan and Wilson are talented comedic leads, who would have made this movie work had the script been any better. As it is, it's not to my liking, but I don't regret seeing it either.",Shanghai Noon
34,lisafordeay,Funny film starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson,6,7 July 2015,"This was on TV a few days ago and I thought it was funny. The movie was about a Chinese man(played by Jackie Chan)who goes to the Wild Wild West and meets up with a quirky young man who is a train robber played by Owen Wilson and the two unlikely duo set off to save a Chinese princess(played by Lucy Lu)who is kidnapped,and its up to Chan and Wilson to save her. The humor is funny and the acting was very good. Chan was awesome and Wilson was great as im a fan of his since Meet The Parents all the way to Night At The Museum franchise.

As a solid fan of Chan's work, I have a modest (in comparison to hard-core fans) collection of his works. In consideration, I have to say that...while this attempt, like his other American attempts, does not exhibit enough of that marvelous comedic fighting style we all know and love, Shanghai Noon is genuinely enchanting, action packed, earnest, and entertaining.Owen Wilson is a natural talent. He brings an honesty to his otherwise shifty personae in everything he does. Frankly, I'm surprised at some of the places he has succeeded in making this work for him. He is a true comedic force on the big screen. This work is a rival to other comedy/action teams, and bears a serious viewing, as I feel it is comparable to my second favorite comedy western, ""Cat Ballou."" In case you're interested, ""Blazing Saddles"" is my first.If you enjoyed this, I highly recommend the following:Jackie Chan: Mr. Nice Guy, Rumble in the Bronx, and Around the World in 80 Days (2004)Owen Wilson: Anaconda, The Haunting (1999), and the Big Bounce.

37,NateWatchesCoolMovies,East careens into West,10,15 August 2016,"I forgot how much goddamn fun Shanghai Noon is. It's pretty much the quintessential east meets west buddy flick (sorry Rush Hour, love you too bbz), and upon rewatching it I realized that it's every bit as awesome, and more so, than I remember as a kid. You take Jackie Chan, a stoic, robotic Chinese fighting machine with the sense of humour god gave a sock, and pair him with Owen Wilson, a wishy washy surfer dude of a cowboy who can't take one second out of the day to stop talking or cracking jokes, and you've got gold. Of course, they need a film to run about in that's just as solid as they're team up, and that's just what we get. This is a bawdy, unapologetic roll in the hay, a genre bender that tosses the American western, the buddy cop flick and the Kung Fu picture into a big cauldron, fires a few bullets in and gives it a big old stir. It's ridiculously fun for its entire duration, an achievement which the sequel just couldn't keep up with. Chan is Chon Wang (say it fast), a Chinese imperial guard on the trail of runaway Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), who has runoff to America. No sooner does he set foot on Yankee soil, he's bumped into peace pipe smoking Natives, and clashed with a band of train robbers led by Roy O Bannon (Owen Wilson), a fast talking soldier of fortune who doesn't seem to have much skill besides yapping his way out of a situation. The two are thrown into a mad dash across then west, Chon looking for the princess, and Roy after the missing gold from the train. It's what movies were made to be, a pure rush of gunfighting and chop socky, kick ass action sequences, all given the boost of Chan's insane talents. He's like a rabid squirrel monkey, and Wilson a drunk sloth, constantly mismatched yet always coming out on top, like the best comic duos always do. They're faced with taking dpwn a few baddies, including Walton Goggins as the dumbest outlaw this side of the Rockies, and a terrifying Xander Berkeley as a corrupt, homicidal marshal. The core of it rests on Chan and Wilson to entertain us though, and even in the down time between action, their energy is infectious, especially in a manic drinking game that just can't be described in writing. Like I said, the sequel, Shanghai Knights, just doesn't capture he magic quite like this one does, and seems to fall flat. You can't go wrong with this original outing though, and it just gets better with age.",Shanghai Noon

He and O'Bannon have to work together, why and how is not important at all.What is important is the fun they have together, and therefore the fun we have while watching that. We have the usual Jackie Chan martial art and this time it is combined with the very funny Owen Wilson talking.

39,xredgarnetx,Fun Western,6,22 April 2007,"SHANGHAI NOON pairs Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson as, respectively, a Chinese royal guard and train robber in search of a kidnapped princess, winningly played by Lucy Liu. The film is strictly slapstick, as is often the case with Chan's fighting style, and Wilson is very funny as Chan's boastful but reluctant sidekick. There's also some name play, which I will not spoil here -- other than to call your attention to Chan's character's name and its pronunciation. The sinister kidnapper is played to the hilt by a familiar Chinese-American actor, Roger Yuan. The film is too long, but Chan keeps things rocking and rolling for most of the ride. His fight using a horseshoe and length of rope against several heavily armed bad guys is hysterical. I would give this a slightly higher rating except for its excessive length and repetitiveness of the stunts.",Shanghai Noon
40,baumer,Unfathomably abysmal,2,29 May 2000,"What a great premise.  The old west meets the chop-socki east.  Stick a martial artist in the old west and watch the sparks fly and the hilarity that ensues.  That is the idea but the idea falls flat. 
Shanghai Noon is not funny.  It is not even a great kung fu film.  Usually Jackie Chan films are fun at the very least.  Even something like Rumble In The Bronx, a film that has very little story to it, was entertaining because of Chan and his incredible wizardry in the art of fighting.  But in this film I was not only not entertained, I was bored with the prosaic effort. Compared to most of Chan's other films this is a squalid pastiche of every western that has gone bad.  It's like the producers of this film went through Sergio Leone, John Ford and Clint Eastwood's trash from years gone by and took all the discarded material and meshed it all together and Shanghai Noon is the result.I guess I was expecting more in Chan's martial arts.  In many of his films he dazzles the audience with his ballet looking moves and his verve to entertain.  In this film, he looks tired and old.  I didn't get the feeling that he was into what he was doing.  And that does not bode well for the film.I guess I could go on and on and berate the film for a few more paragraphs but that is almost pointless.   Being as ardent towards the film as I am, I just want to forget that I saw it and move on.  I must admit however, most people that have seen this film enjoyed it and I am in the minority here. But I just don't see it.  It felt lazy and not on par with Chan's other previous efforts.  But see it for yourself and judge for yourself.
It's too bad though, I had high hopes for this film and after seeing a disappointing MI2 on the same weekend, I had hoped one of the big movies would live up to the reputation which has followed it around.  But no such luck.  I guess I will have to go see Gladiator for the fifth time or maybe Road Trip for the third.  Seeing a repeat showing of these two films would still be more entertaining that the other two.  And that is a shame.2 out of 10.

43,jhclues,Chan And Wilson Take The West By Storm,8,15 August 2000,"(**contains possible spoilers**)East meets West for laughs and plenty of action in director Tom Dey's `Shanghai Noon,' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.  In 1881 China, Royal Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is smuggled out of the Forbidden City and taken to Carson City, Nevada, where she is held for a one hundred thousand dollar ransom in gold.  The Emperor promptly dispatches his top three Imperial Guards, an interpreter (Henry O), and the interpreter's nephew, Chon Wang (Chan), to deliver the gold and bring the Princess safely back to China.  During a botched train robbery in Nevada, the interpreter is killed, and Chon Wang sets out to find the man responsible; but first he must discharge his duty to the Emperor, by finding Carson City and the Princess.  Along the way he meets up with a left-handed gunslinger named Roy O'Bannon (Wilson), who was the leader of the gang that tried to rob the train.  The cowboy who killed his uncle, a man named Wallace (Walt Goggins), Wang learns, was a new guy to the gang; Roy didn't know him, and nobody, of course, was to supposed to get hurt.  Once that issue is resolved, it's shades of Butch and Sundance as Wang and Roy team up to rescue the Princess (and the gold). 	Dey alternates the action and laughs, often combining the two, and keeps it all moving along at a good, even pace.  The likable Chan puts plenty of spirit into Wang, and the fight scenes are spectacular; well choreographed and orchestrated.  He also proves himself adept on the comedy front, at times infusing a bit of Stan Laurel in his expression.  The charismatic Wilson also shines as Roy, with a subtle, straight-forward delivery that is right on the mark.  There's a chemistry between the two that works splendidly, and their timing is perfect.  And they play it with a contemporary attitude that fuels the off-beat ambience; at times, it's like a Newman and Redford in the Twilight Zone.  Liu, as well, gives a notable performance, lending a Royal mien to her Princess Pei Pei.  There's a number of memorable scenes here, including one in which Wang encounters the Sioux (and we can only guess what's really in that peace-pipe); and another, early in the film, that finds Roy buried up to his neck and left to die in the desert, only to be found by Wang, who puts two chopsticks in Roy's mouth and tells him to start digging.  The comedy plays well throughout the film, managing real laughs without resorting to slapstick or sight gags.  Also worthy of mention is that the opening scene was filmed in China, in the Forbidden City. 	The excellent supporting cast includes Jason Connery (Andrews), Brandon Merrill (Indian wife), Roger Yuan (Lo Fong), Xander Berkeley (Van Cleef) and Russell Badger (Sioux Chief).  `Shanghai Noon' is, above all, a fun movie; a light-hearted and often hilarious spin on the old west, forever changed (historically and cinematically), now that Wang and O'Bannon have happened onto the scene.  This is one pair of cowboys you're going to remember, and this is one funny movie you're going to want to see more than once.  And that's a promise, Pardner.  I rate this one 8/10.",Shanghai Noon
44,stamper,Great fun,8,4 September 2000,"This is really a good Jackie Chan flick. The action is good and plenty, the stunts are unbelievable and hard to follow and there are many, many big laughs. OK this one is not only good stuff (which film is nowadays) and there are a few scenes I'd rather had not seen or would have, but only if altered, but these are not frequent enough to spoil the film. If these scenes had been good it would have got this film a 9 or 10 easily. The supporting cast is good too, especially Owen Wilson, who I had already seen before in The Haunting, but in that film I only thought he had a weird nose and nothing more. In this one he is different though and not only pretty good at what he does, but funny too. The bad guy, or better guys are doing their job, nothing more, some better than others and quite frankly, some more irritatingly than others. The female supporting cast is good as well, there are two females here, Lucy Liu and Brandon Merrill , the latter one unknown, who both act good and who just happen to be pretty as well, so no criticism about the cast here. All in all this film has a good supporting cast plus everything that has made Chan what he is today. That means there are bloopers at the ending you do not want to miss. The bathtub blooper really is darn hilarious.

The buddy - western/comedy is a nice movie that spins mostly around Wilson's funny character and Chan's fast fighting.The movie has as all Chan's movies funny kung fu scenes, as when Chan fights some Native Americans beside a river and up in some trees, or when Chan fights on a moving train, or when it's a big showdown in a saloon. It is all very entertaining and speaks very well to Jackie Chan's most respected area, without doubt in his manage to move his body around and using everything he sees to fight with. Great buddy-comedy! STARS: *** 3/5 (the sequel is better)",Shanghai Noon
47,bopdog,"Funny, exciting, warm hearted-- an amazing movie!",8,26 May 2000,"This movie is wonderful. It's funny, exciting, and warm hearted. Jackie Chan is amazing, and his brand of stunt acrobatics really travels well. The guy who played his partner was also great-- he reminded me of what president Bill Clinton might have been like if he was a young cowboy back in America's 1880s. Rave comments for everything! Go see it-- you'll love it. I gave this a 10 out of 10.",Shanghai Noon
48,Movie-12,"Jackie Can turns a movie with potential into a confused, whimsical parody. ** (out of four)",4,6 July 2000,"SHANGHAI NOON / (2000) ** (out of four)	Ever question why movie theaters do not have clocks in them? I think I just found out the reason why, and it is Tom Dey's new production called ""Shanghai Noon,"" an action comedy that uses routines of the road movie, the buddy comedy, slapstick parody, and probably more. The theater owners do not want audiences to realize how much time of their lives they are wasting away watching a movie as horrible as this piece of junk. You know a film is bad when you keep looking at your watch throughout its running time; you know a film is even worse when you keep looking for a watch throughout its running time, even though you know you are wearing no such time device. ""Shanghai Noon"" placed me in that vary situation. Jackie Chan is one of the most bewildering actors in business right now; I feel depressed that other countries will be subject to his film's, which come from the same beautiful United States I proudly live in today. In ""Shanghai Noon"" he once again practices his peripheral bad-taste character sketch, this time portraying an Imperial Guard named Chon Wang during 1881 in China's Forbidden City. Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) has been kidnapped by her American tutor, Calvin Andrews (Jason Connery), who is working for an ex-Imperial Guard named Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), who demands a hefty ransom paid for her release. 	To the amazement of nobody in the audience, Chon Wang is chosen to recruit the princess home. During the journey, he runs into a group of outlaws led by Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), who eventually becomes his partner and friend. He also meets Marshall Nathan Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley), who is determined to capture and or kill Roy. 	For the first time that I can remember in a movie featuring Jackie Chan, excluding the involving ""Rush Hour,"" the story is acute. Although the setup is a little displeasing, the movie depicts events that construct a potentially strong narrative plot line. Unfortunately, this is Jackie Chan we are talking about, and it is his martial arts comic action that turns a somewhat fortunate story into a zany, nonsensical western action picture without direction.	Nothing much occurs during the film's second act. Wang and O'Bannon make attempts to rescue the princess but only place themselves in greater danger every time. The entire middle of this movie is one unfunny comic situation after another, which would not be all that bad if the comedy was actually funny, but it is not. I never once laughed, or even cracked a smile, with the movie's desperate, contrived whimsical endeavors. 	Another flaw in ""Shanghai Noon"" is the complete lack of character development. We never learn anything personal about the characters; they are all one-dimensional, shallow plot puppets. I was not interested in the story simply because I did not care in the least about the characters. Since the entire movie is based on Princess Pei Pei being in danger, the lack of concern for the people on screen is a serious conflict.
	""Shanghai Noon"" is a good looking production; the film captures the eighteenth century with a believable and contemporary historical feeling and an atmosphere that is both scenically sweeping and visually enticing. Director Tom Dey captures the old west through suitable performers in nifty costume and set designs. The film's energetic appearance and swift action scenes make it even more of a catastrophe that this production is as awful as it is.  	The film goes on and on in a seemingly measureless agony of non-stop ridiculousness; ""Shanghai Noon"" has no sense, no purpose, and no intelligence. If there were clocks in movie theaters, this would be one of the occasions in which staring at the hour hand would be more intriguing than participating in the movie itself. In a way the movie insults American audiences by making a movie this bad; they must have the idea that people have absolutely nothing better to do and have no life, because that is the only legitimate reason one would have for seeing ""Shanghai Noon"".",Shanghai Noon
49,FlickJunkie-2,An excellent Jackie Chan showcase,7,26 December 2000,"Since 1962, Jackie Chan has appeared in over 70 films in China, but until recently, he was virtually unknown to most U.S. audiences.  He has always been well known among those who enjoy martial arts and he is famous in those circles as the daredevil actor who does all his own stunts, some of which have been wildly dangerous.However, Chan has always transcended his martial arts confinements, because besides being a talented martial arts athlete and stuntman, he is also an excellent comedian.  He is a master of physical comedy who has often been compared with Buster Keaton, whom he idolizes.  Now that he is learning to speak English, he is sure to become a big hit in the states.`Shanghai Noon' along with his smash hit `Rush Hour' (grossing $141 Million at the box office) have marked a turning point in his career.  The emphasis in both films is on Jackie Chan the comedian rather than Jackie Chan the stuntman and karate expert.  Sure, there are numerous scenes where he frenetically subdues a dozen or so thugs while climbing up walls and somersaulting through the air, but these action scenes are far sparser and less spectacular than in his Chinese films.`Shanghai Noon' didn't do as well at the box office (still a respectable $55 Million) as `Rush Hour', but it was actually the better film.  Chan is clearly the star in this film whereas he was overshadowed by Chris Tucker's outrageousness in `Rush Hour'.  Despite its insubstantial story, a sendup of American Westerns with a side order of Chinese, this film is a good showcase for Chan's broad range of talents, especially his physical comedy.Owen Wilson adds a wry note to the film by creating a bank robber that is as out of place in the American West as an Asian cowboy.  Wilson plays his part like a California surfer who has recently completed a set of Tony Robbins tapes.  He is so incongruous to his surroundings that almost everything he does is funny.Though not a superlative film, `Shanghai Noon' is entertaining and funny and worth seeing for light comedic entertainment.  I rated it a 7/10.  It continues to establish Jackie Chan as a comedic force to be reckoned with, and from whom we are likely to get much great entertainment in the future.",Shanghai Noon
50,redkiwi,Fun Jackie flick,8,10 September 2000,"You know what you are getting when you see a Jackie Chan film, but this was definitely one of his best.  Owen Wilson and Lucy Liu played supporting parts well, in what was a particularly well made film that featured such stars as Wyatt Earp, John Wayne and Lee van Cleef.A fun film that is definitely worth seeing, this features some excellently choreographed fight scenes, and despite being very silly on a continuous basis, it definitely made me laugh.",Shanghai Noon
51,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: Safe for non-action-lovers!,8,30 March 2002,"OK, action fans out there! You've been wanting to drag along your romance/drama SO to a martial arts film that he/she will not hate. This is the one.Shanghai Noon is a great comedy first and foremost. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan is amazing, and unlike Rush Hour (which rattled race issues just a little), the inter-cultural humor is tasteful and respectful. Both actors shine in their niches.Unlike many action films (especially Jackie Chan's), this one has a real plot, and while it doesn't exactly have ""something to say that changed my life"", there are satisfying themes, the story is original, and the characters have some depth, while being both a parody of and honoring the western movie genre. This is a hard stunt to pull off.Plus, there is plenty of hand-to-hand combat and fighting. As usual with Jackie Chan, there is virtually no blood or gore -- this is soft, cartoony violence, which is not to imply it's cheesy. Kids will enjoy this film.Who should see this film:-- Action lovers (and drag along your SO)-- People who just plain like comedies. It's worth it.-- Drama lovers or arty types who hate Arnold Schwartzenegger but might like to try an action flick just this one time.I rate Shanghai Noon a 9 out of 10.",Shanghai Noon

55,lagudafuad,wonderful combo,6,31 March 2013,"Shanghai Noon is one soft comedy that I just found myself loving, the movie pulls out a very nice romantic soft comedy that you will just go crazy for. Shanghai Noon has a nice pairing maybe the pairing is not as great as the one in Rush Hour but Owen Wilson style of comedy is one that I have come to love and appreciate.Owen Wilson's style is a laid back demeanor, and that of Jackie is one of comic martial art and scenes the mix is just unique. The movie can be seen to be of a form of a buddy cop genre.The movie paid homage to some nice western classics, like High Noon and Jackie Chan's character is named Chon Wang meant to sound like John Wayne. Also to love in the movie is the unusual suspense, the movie possess its own way of thrill, which include leaving you the viewer to really think: One of the things that I liked and is part of the suspense is the idea that Owen's Character Roy is the worse gunslinger around (this guy can't shoot straight to save his life), and somehow he has managed to survive in the west and even be the leader of an armed robbery gang. The second thing that got me thinking is also about the Roy character that was buried to his neck in the desert and somehow managed to get out from there and get to the nearest town before Jackie who was going on foot and a horse. Although when asked how he did it, he claimed to have dug himself out with chopsticks.The movie plot crosses across two regions, China and the US, in China Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is an imperial guard and he has his eyes for the princess Pei-Pei (Lucy Liu), who got abducted and taken to America. Wang's affection for the princess made him join the Imperial Guards sent to bring back Pei-Pei, a ransom in gold was also sent by the king to Pei-Pei's captive. When in America in the west the train that they were in gets robbed and by Roy (Owen Wilson) and his crew and that is how Wang and Roy met.The two later joined together in an attempt to rescue the princess from her captive.The combination of the two was well received by many critics, which led to the movie having a huge sale in DVD's, and the movie itself was also a box office success.www.lagsreviews.com",Shanghai Noon

57,supertom-3,Chan's best American film!,8,23 July 2004,"One of the best action films of recent years! Shanghai Noon is a comedy gem. It features decent action, although in truth some of the weakest Chan has ever done, but the action is still excellent. This east-meets-west in the Wild West kick-fest is brilliant stuff and Chan finds his ultimate partner in comedy crime, Owen Wilson. Whereas the Rush Hour series has the over the top and screechingly loud Chris Tucker, this has Wilson whose laid back, whispery charm works excellently. His delivery of lines is fantastic and he really plays off Chan superbly. Wilson is effortlessly likeable while Tucker is the sort of comedian who may wear thin. The film looks great with some great production design and lush cinematography while the musical score is excellent from Randy Edelman. The comedy is simple and is all about delivery and timing rather than elaborate jokes and this is what Chan and Wilson excel at. Lucy Lui one of the most naturally gorgeous women ever stars as well to add some eye candy. All in all this is my favourite Chan film; it's a perfect combination of Hollywood blockbuster comedy and Hong Kong action. ****",Shanghai Noon

The movie has a very serious plot, but feels like a big adventure with its occasional funny moments. Not only is Jackie Chan an excellent physical performer he has great intensity over-all, as shown in the extremely under-rated ""Piklik Fo (ThunderBolt)"". Also, Owen Wilson makes good as the unconventional outlaw. The comedy is simple enough to understand which makes the movie easy to digest (so to speak).Also the action is tense and towards the end there is a brilliant, nice feeling.

Every western stereotype you can think of is brought to bear in this movie - cowboys, Indian's, bank robbers, evil sheriffs, coolies, etc. - and that's exactly why it works: they poke fun at everything and everyone, political correctness be damned!  If you have ever been a fan of the old-fashioned westerns, you will especially appreciate some of the subtler humor i.e., the sheriff's is named after Van Cleef (Lee Van Cleef having been second only to Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti western genre).  The pairing of Chan and Wilson was pure genius, for although they both play simple klutzes, their comedic styles couldn't be more different if they tried.  While Chan relies heavily on physical humor - playing to the camera and grimacing horribly in pain (often for real)), Wilson is introspective and low key punctuating his jokes with a toned down whining nasality.  Yet, both still manage to achieve their desired effect.  The two also mesh extremely well and feed off one another's energy, which adds to the ambience.  Of course, the question on everyone's mind is whether it contains the patented action sequences we expect from a Jackie Chan flick.  The answer is a resounding ""Yes""!There are some several incredible stunts - the logrolling scene from the trailers is especially impressive. As always there are amusing choreographed fight scenes - Chan's arsenal of weapons includes everything from traditional Chinese martial arts weapons (it is the first time I've seen a three section staff in a movie in the past decade) to trees and moose antlers.  Also, typical of his films, the fights also maintain a cartoonish quality, highlighting Chan's acrobatic style over blood and gore (it is usually Chan's characters that do the bleeding).If you are starved for a comical action film pull up to the trough.",Shanghai Noon

63,buzznzipp1995,The honest China man and...an outlaw cowboy with issues?,10,16 September 2006,"I honestly did not know what to expect, after seeing the 'pre' on the trailer. It was however a screamingly funny situation that started with an outlaw cowboy and a kindly Chinaman looking for a princess, in America. This duo when they came together was another one of those, 'fresh-eyed' originals. I get chills thinking about when I first saw it with a new friend that I had back in 2000. I still love this movie. The premise is a funny one, right off the bat these two are good at what they do, but are looked upon as mere screw-ups, by their employers, well at least Chan's Boss looked at him that way. But the coming to America to track the princess, meanwhile Wilson's character is a robber and a thief, who has an ongoing schmooze for the female kind. A Royal Chinese guardsman and a frontier cowboy, with issues. What a pair of jokers. But you can't help but love these two anyway. The cowboy, (Owen Wilson)who always seems to analyze things, and over talk them. Chan's character, is looking to do the right thing, for King and country, in cowboy territory. From the first collision with these two ill-fated men with separate missions, Wilson's cowboy, is thinking that he is in control, because the simple little China man does not understand the predicament. Only to the Cowboy's surprise, that the little visitor is very much, a knowledgeable one, if Wilson's character will stop 'jawwing' so much. One of the funnest parts to the story, was those two trading shots of liquor in the bathtubs at the 'Cat-house' then after going for quite a long time, with their drinking game, the woman opens the door to see how they are doing and they look up covered in bubbles, drunk as skunks, and with two tubs ...they are sharing the same one, laughing like crazy! They go through quite a few Miss-adventures leading up to their finale' at the church. This for me beside side-splitting laughter, superb directing and a look at some of the bloopers, makes this one a super-hit!I recommend for the discriminating sense of humor, that enjoys oddities and good clean fun!

She is there only to create a story to hang the movie on and as set decoration.Jackie Chan is the real standout in the acting category.  He does not give the one-note performance so many action stars are guilty of  (Stallone, Van Damme, etc., etc.).  He actually turns his part into a real character that is, as much as is possible, believable.There were some real glaring historical and factual errors: Edwardian furnishings long before the Edwardian period existed, Plains Indians in the desert in Nevada (?).  There is just not enough attention to the small details.Many of the plot twists are telegraphed long before they occur -- NO subtle foreshadowing.This is not a thinking person's movie -- but most people do not go to the movies to think.

72,cutter-12,"Could have been much, much better",6,9 May 2002,"The much ballyhooed Owen Wilson was the worst part of this film.  Not that he's an unlikeable personality, he just delivers flat, useless lines, most of which are obvious ad libs.  Jackie Chan, always likeable and not so ready to play with the dialogue makes this middling comic western watchable.  He's slowing down a bit with age but his quicksilver moves are still blinding by anyone's standards and his unique knack for physical comedy is an always welcome additive.  The problems with this film is the substandard direction, third act writing and the fact that Wilson seems unwilling to play an appropriate character.  He had the chance to send-up any number of western icons from Paul Newman to Kirk Douglas and manages to prove he he hasn't got a clue what his character was meant to be.  He gets on your nerves fast and stays there despite the odd laugh he does manage to generate.  The story, though derived from other western sources, is solid enough.  Putting Chan in the Old West (Well actually the Canadian West doesn't much resemble New Mexico but hey this a B movie anyway) as a hapless member of the Chinese Imperial Guard tracking down the kidnapped princess he's smitten over is actually quite good, even clever.  But it tends to not deliver on the promise it holds, building toward a completely contrived outcome which is a shame.  Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD fill in some plot holes but really the wayward direction and the last few pages of the script seem to be the problem.  On a whole the film succeeds best when it's sending up some of the more famous westerns, but Owen Wilson and Director Dey all but water it down.

76,thomas-hardcastle-2,"Fun, half-decent, but they keep pairing a genius with a fool!",6,30 May 2008,"Big fan of Chan, so allow me to be critical, if I may, about what, at the end of the day, is not a bad movie at all.This film is worth seeing at least once. It's worth catching on Channel 5 in a couple of years' time. It's a pop-corner, a family fun, watch it one minute, forget most of it the next, thrill ride.As usual Jackie Chan's creativity is enough to impressive even non-fans of the Kung-Fu genre. He dazzles, and entertains convincingly enough to forgive him for Rumble in Hong Kong. In this film, he uses similar moves to the ones executed in far lesser-known Hong Kong movies of the eighties. There are interesting new ideas that are pulled off in exemplary form, whilst Chan maintains his friendly and charming persona to the death.Once again, however, Chan has fallen victim to his own circumstances - meaning that he has had to be paired with the current comic of the time. We've had enough of Chris Tucker by the end of the first Rush Hour, and its sequel, Rush Hour 2 was a year away from release. In the mean time, Jackie is paired up with the ever-charming, Owen Wilson, who's in the film to make the ladies blush, and the men think, ""he ain't such a bad guy."" Wilson's addition makes the film more available to the Western market, who still, it seems, want an American star next to Chan, to guide him through the language barrier in a comically pleasing way. In all honesty, it grinds, and towards the end of the film, you will be left thinking that Chan should have left Wilson a long time before the film's climax.Lucy Liu plays the Princess/love interest/innocent captive in a convincing way, but I couldn't help thinking she was the ice-maiden in Ally McBeal, and the bondage gangster with a foul-mouth in Payback. Her character had to play it innocently, so she appeared to have no freedom to explore her character, leaving the smallest amount of character detail to the two main protagonists.The script is cheap and cheerful, and won't win any awards, but aids the progression of the storyline in a humorous way, without being clever, or arty about it.It's not a real Western. It's more like a kids impression of a Western, with a spin-kick or two added to the pot.",Shanghai Noon
77,poem,Jackie Chan western-style: good,8,17 April 2001,"Well, this movie is of course not a revolution.It is just another one of these typical Jackie Chan movies, now a little bit different, obviously more ""western style"", with far, far less stunts, but maybe even more funny than ever. Especially all these cites from other western movies are witty.A very sympathical piece of good entertainment.",Shanghai Noon
78,JohnnyPHreak,A fun feel but it let me down,7,29 July 2000,"Going into this I had high expectations. I'm a big Jackie Chan fan. Anything he's in I have to see. It had a good concept and I liked the trailer. I also heard that it was even better than MI:2. Nope, sorry. I don't think so. It had all the elements of a good fight film but it just didn't grab me like Rush Hour did. Jackie Chan stars Chon Wang (say it real fast), a Chinese guard in training that hitches a ride with his uncle and three guards to America to find a kidnapped Princess (the lovely Lucy Liu). But when things go wrong Jackie has to team up with the nicest train robber ever Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). What follows is the obligatory buddy action film but in the wild wild west. The film has some very corny moments that make you feel out of place. The bad guys also are very thin, paper like. There are no new breaking ground elements to the movie either. Jackie is great and fun to watch. Lucy Liu is great to look at and she can hold her own with the boys. The bad part about this film other than the villains is Owen Wilson. I have nothing against him he just didn't fit here. He way too nice and not funny at all. He's not a person you care about too much in this film. His brother Luke would have been better. (I think he's the better actor.) The fights scenes are what keep this film from being dull and boring. Jackie does some amazing things with the stuff around him. He is the master when it comes to fighting with his surroundings. If your a Jackie Chan fan go see Shanghai Noon. For everyone else, it's fun, at times exciting, has Lucy Lui and the fights are great. But there are better action comedies out there. This one tries too hard and doesn't live up to expectation.",Shanghai Noon
79,Philaura,Enjoyable,7,23 October 2000,"We enjoyed the film.  Have to agree with the user that commented about the Indians.  What was up with the casting of the Native Americans?  Jackie Chan looked more Indian than his tribal gift wife did.  I liked her though.  She just looked as though she had Irish or some other European ancestorial background as did others. (more likely Canadian)Jackie's stunts were not his best, but certainly very entertaining.  Wilson was great too.  Overall a good choice for a fun evening.",Shanghai Noon

81,rutt13-1,Most enjoyable Hollywood offering so far...,8,20 June 2001,"It's a heck of a lot like ""Rush Hour,"" but I liked Owen Wilson more than Chris Tucker, and this film features more of the elements that make a great Jackie flick.  Namely, fighting and stunts.  Chan and Wilson have great chemistry, and many of the western cliches are explored to hilarious effect. I love Lucy Liu, and here we get to see her kick some butt, as well as look as lovely as ever.  The two stars' different types of humor work very well together, and it's got some great cinematography, too.  I would definitely call this Chan's best American film, and would go so far as to say it's a great place to start if you've never seen his work and are seeking an introduction....",Shanghai Noon
82,Soledad-2,A true disappointment,6,21 May 2001,"I sincerely thought this movie was going to be great but it was a true disappointment.  I think Rush Hour is by far a much better movie. The plot is very similar but it was very well developed in Rush Hour, and a lot funnier, while in Shanghai Noon there was something missing. Nevertheless, Jackie Chan is a great actor and he will always be one of my favorite.",Shanghai Noon
83,Nigel St. Buggering,"He's still Jackie, just slightly slower",7,21 May 2000,"Before I begin to complain, let me say that I gave this film a 7 out of 10; I don't dislike it.That said, there is a certain amount of sadness to this entire scenario. The action scenes have slowed, the stunts become less spectacular, and in some cases, clearly not performed by Jackie Chan.  Now I don't blame him for this...at the ripe old age of 42, Jackie has destroyed himself for our entertainment time after time.  So much so, in fact, that his poor, tortured, patched and re-patched body just can't handle the kind of abuse he used to heap on himself.  It shows.In addition to the obvious slowdown of the action, it once again becomes painfully clear that very few american directors know how to clearly portray a complex fight scene.  Even with Jackie not at the top of his game, this is incredibly complicated choreography compared to most american fare.  Where a Hong Kong director would pull the camera back and give us long takes, making certain that the moves and positions of the combatants are clear to the audience, american directors insist on bringing the camera in close and cutting often.  This blurs the clarity of the action and creates a lot of confusion as to who's where, and who's fist is colliding with whose face.Complaining aside, action is only half the draw of a Jackie Chan film. Comedy has always been a strong element in his ouvre, and ""Shanghai Noon"" doesn't let us down there.  Any longtime Jackie fan knows of his incredible gift for physical comedy, and his goofing is as good as ever here.  The real surprises lie in some very well-written comic dialogue, and that dialogue's delivery by Owen Wilson.  Given that Wilson is a gifted comic writer himself (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore), one has to wonder if he re-composed some of his dialogue himself.  Some of the eastern-cliche meets western-cliche exchanges between the two are inspired.Lucy Liu, on the other hand, I found disappointing.  It may seem a strange thing to say about a chinese actress, but I found her unconvincing as a Chinese.  Her performance seemed like a shallow american interpretation of what a chinese woman would be like.  As a longtime fan of Hong Kong action cinema, I just find myself wondering what Anita Mui or Maggie Cheung could have done in the role.All in all, this is on a par with ""Rush Hour""; a solid american take on the Hong Kong institution that is the Jackie Chan movie.  It's just no ""Drunken Master II"", that's all.",Shanghai Noon
84,Troy2Slick,An okay movie for Jackie Chan/Owen Wilson fans...,6,17 June 2003,"I wasn't expecting too much when I went to watch this movie. I got about what I was expecting out of it. It's your typical Jackie Chan flick, only in the wild, wild west. If you like Rush Hour 1 or 2, then I'm sure you'll like this one.      Recommended if you like Jackie Chan or Owen Wilson. 2 *'s out of 4 *'s.",Shanghai Noon
85,mercury-26,A fun mess,6,4 June 2000,"Used to be all that was good about a Jackie Chan film was the martial arts scenes. Watch Jackie fly through a window! Watch Jackie fight the bad guy on the ledge of a tall building! The story of the movie was pretty much built around the carefully choreographed fight scenes. His latest, Shanghai Noon, has a good story-I think. The story is not so well told, but I was able to piece it all together after I left the theater.It's confusing from the very beginning: Opening in China, a princess (Lucy Liu) is meeting the very undesirable man chosen to be her husband. Among the imperial guards bowing to revere her is Chan's character, Chon Wong, who is smitten with her. He later overhears a conversation between she and her American english teacher about sneaking away to America, where she can find a husband of her own choosing. A scene later, the imperial guards are called together again because the princess has been kidnapped. What? Did I miss something? Chon Wong gets to tag along with the other imperial guards traveling with the ransom of jewels and gold to New Mexico. A scene or two later, the princess arrives at a Chinese workers' camp where, you guessed it, she's kidnapped. Then the train carrying Chon Wong and the other imperial guards is held up by a group of bandits led by Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Jackie Chan-style stunts and martial arts scenes ensue. The storytelling doesn't improve.I had fun at this movie, but only because of some funny physical comedy and a few well-staged action sequences. Its creators never figure out a way to bring the plot together in a way that keeps the story flowing. In a word, it's sloppy. The plot is so clunky that instead of taking you for a ride, it drags you behind the horse.To its credit, it never intends to be taken too seriously. The biggest laughs come from lines aimed at the now-extinct genre, the western (although, Wilson's line that, even if you didn't see the movie, you probably saw in the trailer, `John Wayne? That's a terrible cowboy name!' bombs. John Wayne was an actor's name, not a cowboy's). No convention of the old westerns is safe here: the quick-draw showdown, the train robbery scene, the bar fight scene, the cowboy/indian rivalry are all given pies in the face. The time to stop picking on this genre, I have to say, has come. Please stop.The film has a few new things to say about racism and prejudice, about learning to accept those who are different than us, and having the courage to stand up for change if the existing system is wrong. In other words, this film's target audience, teenagers, will enjoy this movie and might actually take a positive thing or two from it.Grade: C+",Shanghai Noon
86,Thornfield2,"Jackie Chan, Sexy Cowboys and Indians, explosions and a kidnapped Princess, who could ask for more?",9,5 July 2001,"Minor-Spoilers.Despite other negative reviews I found this movie to be quite entertaining. I love Jackie Chan flicks and this film was more than fun to watch for me. It has action (superb action at that), wonderful romance (the romance between The Princess and Wang especailly), a tough-ass Princess who's not just another stereo-typical, innocent and helpless wimp, a cool Indian chick who can whoop any cowboy's butt and finally, Owen Wilson, who looked pretty darn good in his cowboy threads (he's not only really good looking here, but he can act too, and he does it well). The buddy relationship between O'Bannon and Wang was charming, one of the best commradories in a western I have ever seen. Even though Owen Wilson is some serious eye candy here, my favorite scene was when Wang finds the Chinese camp and speaks to the Princess and she tells him she can do more for the people in America than back in China. Any history buff can tell you that the Chinese were treated poorly in the West (although in the flick their grief as brought on by one of their own). This film was a pleasure to watch and I really liked the blend of all the different cultures. 9 out of 10.",Shanghai Noon
87,joshfedderson,This is not the East! This is the West! The sun doesn't rise here it sets here!,10,29 May 2018,"This a great and fun movie, and I have to say that Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson make a great and hilarious team. Forget the haters, this movie is one that I will watch again, and again. The story is fun as well, in 1880's China the Princess Pei Pei has been kidnapped and Chon Wang volunteers to rescue her and bring her back home. As he travels to America and to The Old West and Nevada he meets Roy O' Bannon a low down not so good Bandit/Cowboy. The two eventually come to terms, and they form this hilarious, unlikely duo of best friends. They eventually succeed in rescuing the princess and the two become heroes.Shanghai Noon is very fun, Jackie Chan and his fighting style is very cool and the fight scene with the Indian's is my favorite fighting scene. I like his name Chon Wang (John Wayne anyone?) Jackie's humor is hilarious. Owen Wilson on the other hand completes the duo with his humor and character, Owen brings his humor in with his sarcasm and saying's ""No, you said wet shirt don't break, not piss shirt bend bar"" that line made me laugh so much. I liked how they brought in the Old West it gives it it's own style.I also like the friendship between Chon and Roy, the two act well together. The story itself seems normal to me, Hero or Heroes rescue princess and saves the day. But Shanghai Noon makes the rescue story even better and more exciting. I have seen the second one Shanghai Knights, and I heard that they are making a third one called Shanghai Dawn, but it's been production for years...it's probably not going to happen, a shame really because I would have loved to see this duo again in a third adventure. 10/10 for Shanghai Noon",Shanghai Noon

90,Sharkey360,Excellent Hollywood Jackie Chan!,10,28 June 2000,"Since Jackie Chan hit Hollywood in recent years, I waited long for an excellent Hollywood film from him. Let's face it, Rush Hour in 1998 was not Jackie-enough and had a weak story. When I first heard of Shanghai Noon and his team-up with Owen Wilson, I thought it would be another RH. But thank goodness, Shanghai Noon turned out to be excellent!Shanghai Noon's like a dream come true for Jackie Chan...roaming the Old West and use his martial arts/stunts with cowboys and Indians. Chan said himself that he wanted to be a cowboy, and he did here! It was very unique and cool to see Jackie ride a horse, wear cowboy outfits, and best of all interact with the era. Chan really really fitted well with the setting, and this is the only film where you actually see Jackie in the Old West! His acting here is also the best I've seen in years, and this really got me.Owen Wilson is a better Western partner for Jackie than Chris Tucker (who's annoying). Wilson's got the act and the comical moments that made me laugh, at the same time he's not too extreme with his act thanks to his coolness. Lucy Liu's good as the Princess from motherland China and I can't think of any other Asian actress to play her role.Shanghai Noon's story is totally balanced with a great mix of action, comedy and catchy dialogue...and the flow went very smoothly. Seeing Jackie use the rope and horse shoe is an original thing to see! The comedy's plenty and very entertaining, and the dialogue...keep your ears open for fun.It's just too bad that Shanghai Noon came out the same week as Mission: Impossible 2. This one's got a lot of goodies, but M:I2 overshadows it with its own. Shanghai Noon's got the potential to gross at least $100 million if it was not for M:I2.Overall, the best Jackie Chan Hollywood production. Worth seeing 5 times in the theaters, and worth getting on home video! Watch it!",Shanghai Noon
91,jmoney-2,"A film that mixes elements ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and Chan's own ""Rush Hour"" with various levels of success.",6,4 June 2000,"Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan continues his leap into American movies by taking on the most American genre of all -- the Western -- in Shanghai Noon, a film that mixes elements of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and Chan's own ""Rush Hour"" with various levels of success.Owen Wilson easily steals the movie right out from under Chan.  The quirky Wilson makes a better American partner for Chan than Rush Hour's Chris Tucker.  Like Chan, Wilson's likability as a hero stems from his lack of cockiness -- both express a goofy amazement in their own achievements that's endearing.Chan's usual Buster Keaton-meets-Fred Astaire-meets-Bruce Lee fighting style is on display as always, albeit with fewer acrobatics than normal.  Missing is Chan's one big stunt -- there's no hanging from a helicopter, no walking down the side of a sky-scraper -- even the closing credits montage of outtakes doesn't feature the usual quota of bone-shattering mishaps involving the actor/stuntman.  One can't help but think that at 46, Chan may be slowing down a bit.With the action toned down, the humor is stepped-up to compensate.  Besides the aforementioned Wilson, yuks are generated by a tribe of Native Americans straight out of a Mel Brooks comedy -- the same goes for Chan's drunken horse.  Xander Berkeley is also thrown in as a psychotic Marshal with Snidely Whiplash facial hair, looking like something out of a silent movie (I spent much of the film waiting for him to tie a damsel to some railroad tracks).  Berkeley, thankfully, manages to make the villain menacing and funny at the same time.  The use of current day rock songs in the soundtrack also serve to pump-up the fun quotient.The movie also comes equipped with a sequel-ready ending that guarantees, box office returns willing, that the cast and crew of ""Shanghai Noon"" will ride again.",Shanghai Noon
92,CMUltra,Successful and FUNNY melding of East and West,7,20 July 2003,"Great fun!Jackie Chan brings his brand of physical comedy to Hollywood with another buddy movie.  Similar to his ""Rush Hour"" series with Chris Tucker, Chan sets this one in the American old west and chooses Owen Wilson as his partner.I like these better than the Rush Hours.  Tucker and Owen are both excellent playing opposite Chan in both series, but the Shanghai series seems to offer Jackie better venues for his elaborate fight sequences.  Saloons, brothels and even wilderness settings are used with great success.And make no mistake, the fight sequences are what make (or break) a Jackie Chan movie.  ""Fight sequence"" of course means something different in a Chan movie as opposed to normal action fare.  Rather than true violence, Jackie's fight scenes are more Vaudeville than ""Pulp Fiction"".  More Chaplin than Jet Li.  Each fight is painstakingly choreographed to interact with the set surrounding it.  Tables, chairs, vases, antlers, shrubbery... the list goes on.  A successful Jackie Chan movie seems to contain a comedy-oriented story, a lightly delivered moral message, and lots of action.  Shanghai Noon certainly delivers here.I spent the entire movie either chuckling to myself or laughing out loud, and had a very satisfied smile when the credits rolled.  Highly recommended.7 out of 10.",Shanghai Noon

Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan are a really good comedy team, with Chan playing the ""straight man"" most of the time. This film has one of the greatest drinking scenes in cinematic history, in which Chan gets to clown around and play his more familiar role.Wilson plays a hilarious ""sensitive new-aged cowboy,"" with a lot of great lines.The jokes are well-written and well-played. The plot is not compelling, original, or realistic... but who cares?On top of the fun comedy, Chan does some good fighting and good stunts. The scene fighting with horse-shoes and rope is some of his better work. There is also a memorable scene, in which Chan is involved in a classic Western bar-room brawl.Overall, this film is not great art, but I can remember very few films I enjoyed more.",Shanghai Noon

In the states, he forms an unlikely alliance with a goofy, but amiable, outlaw played by Owen Wilson. Chan and Wilson make an absolutely hilarious comedy team in this riotous, action-packed western send-up. Cliche after cliche falls prey to the film as the two heroes run roughshod through the west. Wilson's comedic delivery is truly remarkable, while Chan holds his own, as well. Of course, Chan again excels in stunt after stunt, setpiece upon setpiece.

98,Klaatu-18,"The best Western buddy movie since ""Butch and Sundance""",9,28 May 2000,"When you go to a Jackie Chan movie you know what you will get: breathtaking action, self-deprecating humor and no sex. This time around it's two out of three, and the sexual element was minimal.The main plot deals with Jackie's efforts to recover the Chinese princess from a treasonous kidnapper. But the engine that powers the plot is the buddy relationship between Jackie and the bank robber.My only beef (and it's a small one) was that the two women in the story didn't have nearly enough to do.  In the few scenes they had they were shown to be very strong women. In the case of the Native American woman who Jackie marries. She'll disappear then reappear at just the right time.Even though a comedy, there are some serious moments dealing with racism and the explotation of the Chinese railroad workers.The night before seeing this film, we went to see ""Mission: Impossible 2"". There was lots of action in that one, too.  But all the characters were flat and uninteresting. The characters in SN are not totally three-dimensional, they don't need to be.  But they are a bit rounder than the M:I2 crew. And the ride was a lot more fun.The only other thing I can say is: don't take any restroom breaks or you'll miss something good. IMHO the drinking game that Jackie and his buddy play is the funniest thing that I've seen on film in a long time.To conclude: see this movie.  No reservations. Nine stars.

99,ad2020,Bumbling in the Wild West....,7,27 October 2000,"I'll start on the movie first. This meets the level of entertainment Jackie Chan tends to mix up, I like the fact he finally got to toy w/ this idea even though he really didn't! This movie managed to entertain me, probably because I fit in the Native American demographic, but I gotta say Jackie's (Man-Who-Fights-In-A-Dress) role in this film was likable, since I can usually tell what a male-chauvinist he is in other films (Owen Wilson's comment to Brandon Merrill in this movie might've been poking fun at that). It seems everybody covered the good ground there is to cover..... I will bring in SPOILERS and what other rants I have. First of all, if there's any comments on Brandon Merrill's Indin' blood quantum, I'd like to see yours first!!! Brandon Merrill is full blooded Cheyenne from what I understand and looks every bit it! Also, in 1881, there were no Indin's except for my people, the Apaches, and they were in Arizona. Even then, most Indin's were wasting away on their brand-new reservations. I don't remember what the roads leading to Carson City looked like, but I do agree from what I remember they don't look like Western Canada! Besides, Jackie Chan is 46, who cares if he's slowing down, he gets a couple of major injuries a movie (save for this one, they really did tie him down on the death-defying part), is still moving relatively swiftly and has remarkable Zen abilities, I'd like to see any of you pull that off at 46! Not to mention it's obvious what conflicts in screen play there were in this flick, but you can't help the feeling the actual grunt work had to be fun. Still, Jackie should've killed the dude who offed his uncle in this movie, Owen Wilson should've been better written in here and Brandon Merrill should've been the only Indin' in this picture!

No offense, but he is like somebody who wants to date your sister and you don't want him to because you know what he's after. Then Jackie Chan is like the guy you WANT to marry your sister, you can imagine sitting with him at the Thanksgiving dinner table and enjoying a good time. I agree with the other review, Wilson/Chan did not seem to gel for some reason. Didn't Chan knock Wilson after release of this movie, saying he whined too much on aches and pains after doing stunts? Sounds like a bad match to me from the start. Loved the stunt horse, I was in stitches watching him. Actually he (the horse) and Jackie made for better stunts and humor then Wilson/Chan. Some scenes were making fun of old cowboy movies and that was sort of fun to watch, but a little rehashed I guess for a Baby Boomer like me. Chan's stunts were hot and well timed as usual. You can tell he's a true professional at everything. Guess what I want to say is he makes it look easy.

When the Princess (Lucy Liu) of the city is unexpectedly kidnapped and brought to Carson City, Jackie takes charge. The princess is taken to a man that is a traitor to the Forbidden City. He asks for a large ransom from the king of the Forbidden City if he wants to see his daughter again. The king assigns four men from the Forbidden City to rescue her. When a train robber (Owen Wilson) attempts to rob the train that the men are riding to Carson City in, Jackie takes charge. He and Wilson eventually hook up in order to save the princess. There is action in this movie, but not as much as there should be. The only thing that keeps this movie afloat is Owen Wilson's great performance.

I really laughed , giggled hard throughout the movie. it was the first time for me had fun so much like that. I won't give away anything about story, but you will enjoy this, it was more fun than Rush Hour, which is very overrated. Owen Wilson wonderfully funny, and cute, and Jackie Chan, always excellent at best.Don't miss the NG which is trademark of Jackie's movie.",Shanghai Noon

I think That Other Guy is pretty cute and he was good in his part. I remember seeing this the Friday it came out and it seemed appealing after a long day...I laughed and had a good time. Its worth the time if your in the mood to see a light-hearted, not exactly historically correct comedy for a few laughs. Unlike some other dumb-ass crap mills from the past few years... this is not TOO overdone and ridiculous, although it has its moments.",Shanghai Noon
107,mmintz,"A little awkward but funny and cute (Kinda like its leading actors, I s'pose)",7,26 October 2001,"""Shanghai Noon"" has Owen Wilson.  That alone makes it worth seeing.
At times, however, it's an awkward juxtaposition of genres that probably weren't meant to go together.  This is most apparent in the first thirty minutes.  For one thing, it could have used a little more development regarding Princess Pei Pei's motivation for fleeing her country.  It's kind of hard to care terribly much about a Princess who abandons her position, country, and family just for a lark.  It's not as if she's just taking the night off (""Roman Holiday"").  She's gone and she isn't coming back.  I guess we're just supposed to cheer her for heroic individuality.
However, once Owen and Jackie are official partners, things pick up and don't let up.  Unlike most comedies, this one doesn't poop out.  Most comedies end with an almost entirely laughless twenty minutes as the plot or the message or both are given perfunctory notice (Tommy Boy, Strange Brew, etc.)  That's where ""Shanghai Noon"" has the action/adventure/western thing going for it. Stretching the genre quite a bit, it's fun and funny and even a little sweet.  That shouldn't be a surprise since it stars Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan (two terribly endearing guys).  Owen gives us more of his `outlaw with a heart' schtick (ala `Bottle Rocket').  His quirky, sensitive, introspective, garrulous cowboy is a delight to see and hear (especially in the middle of the movie when he and Jackie are imprisoned and when he's showing Jackie the ropes of being a cowboy).      Jackie gives us more of his ""butt-kicker with a heart"" (owing more to Chaplin than Lee) as usual.  He fights the baddies with just about everything imaginable: a horse-shoe tied to a rope, elk horns, his ponytail, baby pines, a revolving mirror, a giant bell, a basket, and even a sheriff's badge (used as a Ninja star).  At one point Owen says to Jackie, ""when I look at you there's something different about you and I can see it.  I can see it in your eyes.""  This is true of both these characters and these actors.Finally, (to its detriment) this flick takes deus-ex-machina to a new level. It seems the action can't progress for fifteen minutes with some outside, unexpected rescue (and it's always just in the nick of time).  The prison break is thanks to Jackie's unwanted Indian bride (who we haven't seen for the last fifteen minutes).  She also rescues them from being hanged. Finally, she and her whole tribe show up at the end of the movie to save the day.  And when Jackie isn't being rescued by his bride, he is busy rescuing Owen (from two different duels).  All in all, however, ""Shanghai Noon"" accomplishes what it sets out to do. It makes you laugh and even warms your heart a little (like a good shot a rye).",Shanghai Noon
108,Roger-81,Great Movie,10,23 October 2000,"I am stunned at some of the negative reviews I've read on here.  I'm not a Jackie Chan fan and have seen a couple of his movies and thought they were alright, but this one I watched twice and busted out laughing both times.  I think this is a very funny, clever movie and Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson were hilarious.  The script was well written, the story line was great, the action was great, the acting and humor was fantastic.  I say I'm not a Jackie Chan fan but if he continues to make movies such as this I will be one.  Great movie!!!!!",Shanghai Noon
109,panicwatcher,Typical Jackie Chan,7,22 April 2001,"This is a typical Jackie Chan movie with a silly plot and ridiculous fight scenes.  None of the plot is believable.  There is some needless swearing and killing that seems to server only to raise the rating to PG-13.Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable movie because of the charm of Jackie Chan.  He always seems to be having fun no matter how much trouble he gets into.  The plot and his problems only serve to provide a framework into which he can fit fight scenes with their incredible, yet funny stunts.  I'll remember the stunts in this movie long after I have forgotten the plot.",Shanghai Noon
110,Karfoo,"New definition for ""funny""",1,4 June 2000,"In my opinion, Jackie Chan has stopped making good movies after the Super-Cop series. From Drunken Master II and on, and that was like six to seven years ago, his movies have had zero plot, and have been action sequences strung together on the flimsiest pretense of a story. This movie proved to be no exception.To sum it up, this movie is a tool for exploiting the ignorance of westerners of the East, and vice versa, to make money. Raised Chinese, I can spot the errors in the film miles away. Since when was the huge courtyard of the Forbidden City used for regular martial exercises? It is a palace, for crying out loud. And did the film makers think no Chinese in those days were smart enough to know ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do""? Going around the West in imperial Chinese uniform is, to say the least, conspicuous. And how far would one get in the States dressed that way in the late 1800's? Not very far, I suspect.But if I were able to suspend my disbelief for so long as to believe all that happened in the film were possible, there is still the matter of the following: the entire film is based on racial/ethnic stereotypes, and most of the humour derived from that. What age do we live in, people? Those were funny back in the 50's and 60's. But in Year 2000? The fact that the film is doing not so badly makes me shake my head at the implications on societies, both Western and Asian, at large.My advice to Chan is this: either do like John Woo, and make Hollywood style films better than the Hollywood people and wow them, or stay at home like many other Chinese film makers, and make Chinese/Hong Kong films that are authentic and true to oneself. Not this sell-out ""let's make a total fool of myself and sell tickets"" garbage.",Shanghai Noon
111,Morgan-10,Hilarious!,9,2 June 2000,"This movie was really fun.  Owen Wilson was fantastic.  He was the funniest side kick ever.  His dialogue and delivery were perfect.  Jackie Chan doesn't disappoint either.  He's such an incredible athlete and his comic timing and delivery is getting better all the time.  The fight scenes weren't as well directed as in his other movies.  I, like others whose comments I've seen, prefer to watch kung fu action from more of a distance with less cutting but it was still exciting to watch.As for the rest of the movie, the plot line was nothing new, nice and simple.  Lucy Lui was good and even had her own action shots.  Mostly this movie was fun, lots of good laugh out loud laughs.  The action was good and the story moved everything along well enough.  I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie.",Shanghai Noon
112,moonlightreflections,"A diverting film, though by no mean Chan's best.",7,31 May 2000,"To be candid, Jackie's previous American endeavor, ""Rush Hour,"" turned to be somewhat of a disappointment for me.  The action was there, as was the clichéd storyline, although Chris Tucker as a co-star did not necessarily appeal to me;  I don't find 26-year-olds acting as if they were in their teenage years particularly amusing.Thus, it was with some skepticism that I went to watch ""Shanghai Noon"" after hearing that Chan would once again be paired with an American actor.  I expected big action and excruciatingly tedious interactions between the two main leads, but was oddly enough provided with the opposite impression.The highlight of this film comes in the form of Chan's and Wilson's complementary roles.  Wilson plays the part of the outspoken, wild cowboy, while Chan opts to convey his feelings through action, following his typical style--an homage to the great silent classics of the past.  Wilson's wit is subtle enough to highlight the talents of Chan, and what Wilson himself does not possess, Chan brings out in him through what he has to offer to the silver screen.  It's a rather remarkable accomplishment, which in several scenes creates a somewhat touching spectacle.So where does the film falter?  Most of the action scenes are really inspired, and feature ingenious uses of ordinary items such as trees or ropes, but there is one main difference between the two actors:  one is a cowboy, the other a martial artist.  As a result, all of the conflicts in the story when the two characters are present consist of different enemies--a gun-rearing adversary for Wilson, and a martial artist or hand-fighting foe for Chan.  In these moments, the film separates the two characters and leads them to different environments, which detaches the viewer to the point where it becomes painfully obvious that there is no real main conflict: it is simply two characters fighting a motley crew of random enemies.The detachment provided by these scenes often leads the viewer to find something else to draw themselves into the film with;  as a result, the performance of Wilson -slightly- steals the show for the majority of the story.  The director obviously attempts to balance this out by adding emotive scenes in which the two characters bond to a certain extent, though by the end of the film one tends to recall more about Wilson's acting than Chan's feats, which is quite a shame.Chan is growing older, and as a result is more restricted to the style of stunts that he can accomplish without heavily jeopardizing his life.  Yet this film remains his strongest American attempt thus far, and features some astounding scenery with a wonderful orchestral accompaniment.  It should prove to be a delight even to those who are not familiar with Chan's earlier material.",Shanghai Noon
113,mgarland,"Funny, funny, funny, and even more enjoyable than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick!",9,14 February 2004,"I like Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, and pairing them up for this movie was a great idea. Jackie is excellent and funny, with enough new moves to make it different from his other movies. Owen Wilson plays the smart-alecky know-it-all cowboy, but he's really just knowledgeable enough to be dangerous. He's not exceptionally good or bad at anything really (except for shooting!!), and it's actually a nice, workable change from movies that have heroes that never miss or get shot 500 times and keep going. The comedy moves right along, with several semi-intellectual comical scenes that make me appreciate comedy that's more than just silly, slapstick goofiness for the sake of a laugh (although, fortunately, there's plenty of that,too). All in all, these guys are as funny together as Jackie was with Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour ""series"". Although, now that both ""series"" have gone to a number Two (sequels), I think it's time to quit while they're ahead.",Shanghai Noon
114,lllama,Best Jackie Chan movie I've seen,8,21 November 2000,"This is the best Jackie Chan movie I've seen, and I think I've seen them all.  In this film Jackie demonstrates his excellent skills in physical comedy.  Great timing and facial expression.  He and Owen Wilson work extremely well together, and I would love to see them together in another film.  At first my husband thought Wilson's ""California surf dude"" caricature was inappropriate, but, as the comedy unfolded, we found that contrast to the typical Western hero to be a great source of comedy, and we found him to be a great partner for Chan.  His slight resemblance to Redford made the ""Butch Cassidy"" scenes work well.The DVD was a lot of fun because the bonus materials made us laugh all over again after the movie.  I was surprised that some really great scenes had been deleted from the movie, but happy that they showed up in the DVD bonus material.  I adored the three Chinese toddlers.  I don't know why the editors cut that tiny, one-minute scene.  The children are precious.  They don't actually DO anything, they just look adorable.  Other deleted scenes would have been fun to see in the movie.  We even found ourselves amused by the silly quiz game included in the DVD.In addition to the great physical action and silliness, the movie was beautiful to watch.  The visuals were fantastic, from the breathtaking scenery (both East and West) to the beautiful, colorful costumes.  As always with a Jackie Chan movie, the intricate choreography was great fun to watch. Often in his movies he seems to wipe out all the bad guys, but in this film the fact that he doesn't always win allows him to explore his comedic talents more.  We got a bang out of the tomahawk scene, which offered a surprise to the audience, along with a great laugh.  Even the bathtub scene, goofy though it was, filled us with belly laughs.  Even little details, such as the few bars of an Aerosmith song at the appropriate moment, added entertainment value for us.I could go on and on, because we enjoyed this flick so much.  We intend to watch it again and again.",Shanghai Noon
115,sgreenwa,A Big Sleeper Surprise,8,29 July 2001,"I was thoroughly pleased with this film. The combo of Chan/Wilson is fantastic...better than Chan/Tucker in Rush Hour. Chan is Chan, always enjoyable. His stunts are slowing down, but he makes up for iut with some cute/funny scenes. HE becomes more comfortable witht he camera with every film he makes, and it helps his overall likability. Why this movie REALLY succeeds is Owen Wilson. This movie should push him over the top if enough people see it. He is LEGITIMATELY funny in his own ""laid back cool guy"" kind of style. Watching him rough it in the old west is hilarious, because you're thinking to yourself, this guy belongs on a surf board on the beach. He really pulls it off here...with fantastic one liners. The way he talks and approaches even the smallest of scenes is funny. His hamrless sarcasm is at it's best here. This movie is an exact replica of one of my all time favorites, ""The Frisco Kid"" with a VERY YOUNG Harrison Ford and Gene Wilder. If you have NOT seen that movie and liked ""Shanghai Noon"" The Frisco Kid is a must see. All they have done is replaced Gene Wilder's Polish Rabbi character with Jackie Chan's Chinese Imperial Guard character. They are both fish out of water characters who have to survive in the wild west. Owen Wilson has the exact same character as harrison Ford...train robbers with heart who ened up helping these fish out of water and gaining a friend and partner in the process. I would LOVE to see a sequel to this movie. ""Rush Hour"", while enjoyable, received too much hype and this movie received too little. I have recommended this film to several people in the mood for a light comedy. I look for BIG THINGS from Owen Wilson in the future...he is one of the funnier guys out there now, and he really does have a UNIQUE style to him that makes him very easy to like.",Shanghai Noon

He tries way too damn hard to be funny and it mostly falls short. The tub scene is pretty funny though.If you need a Jackie Chan fix, Rumble in the Bronx is way funnier and has better action scenes.(Food for thought, is it me or is there an underlying message that white folks are ignorant and cultureless and that Indians and Chinese people the only ones with culture?)",Shanghai Noon

However, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, filled with Jackie's trademarked fight-scenes and self-effacing humor.  Owen Wilson is passable as laid-back cowboy Roy O'Bannon, but his anachronistic surfer psycho-babble would have become annoying very quickly if it had been featured any more prominently in the film.  Instead, he serves as an acceptable foil to Jackie Chan's character, and the chemistry between the two actually works in most places, unlike the somewhat forced comaraderie between Chris Tucker and Jackie in Rush Hour (although I liked that film too, this one is definitely better.)  In fact, part of the humor in this movie are the obvious anachronisms, similar to the humor in ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."", but in this case, less is definitely more.  I particularly enjoyed the scene with Jackie smoking the peace pipe with the Indians, and also the bathtub/Chinese drinking game, just for sheer fun that was evident in both scenes.Overall, I'd say it's Jackie Chan's best movie to date, and definitely worth the full price of admission.",Shanghai Noon
118,mikerichards,"East meets Western - fun, but not a classic.",9,13 June 2001,"Let's get one thing straight - if you want to watch a Western, go see one of the classics. This movie is not a Western, it just happens to be set there.Jackie Chan is still relatively unknown in the West, but one of Asia's greatest stars. With any luck, more movies like this will make him more popular over here as we sorely need some actors who look like they're enjoying their job. Chan does that throughout the movie and you can't help but grin along.The real surprise had to be Owen Wilson, who has popped up in bit parts in many movies, but until now his roles haven't actually required him to act - what a mistake. He plays a surfer-dude born one century too early making ends meet as a bandit so laid back he's almost horizontal.Combining his verbal skills with Chan's eyewatering martial arts and physical dexterity was a great move. The two play off each other brilliantly (and nowhere better than in a bath scene that had me crying in laughter).It isn't perfect, it needs some editing in places and there is some unnecessary swearing that might offend some, but it *is* a lot of fun. If you haven't seen any Jackie Chan before this is a good place to start.",Shanghai Noon

He is still the read deal when it comes to stunts and fights.  The western bar brawl scene is probably the best I've ever seen on film.  Owen Wilson continues his quirky character streak as the wanna be outlaw whose noterity could use a little work and a better selection of cahoots (his posse is one of the dumbest but funniest in recent memory).  And the real find here is Brandon Merril as the ""Indian Wife"" that knows more than we think she does.  A real beauty and a gifted actress to boot, considering she isn't given much to work with.This film is summer entertainment to the highest degree.

This was my first Jackie Chan flick, and I enjoyed it enough to try another - probably the sequel, Shanghai Knights. Inclusion of puns is often a reliable indication that a comedy will be lame but the puns are good (Shanghai Noon? Chon Wang?) and the comedy is better.     The movie fails to grab the audience for the first 15 or 20 minutes but then finds its stride and becomes more engaging.  Many other reviewers comment on the chemistry between Chan and Owen Wilson (which gets better as the film progresses), but there is a total lack of chemistry between Liu and Chan. Indeed, the scenes with the most passion are the ones between Liu and bad guy Lo Fong (played by Roger Yuan).  And Brandon Merrill sizzles, although no one in the film seems to notice. After about twenty minutes my wife said ""everyone is just saying their lines.""

White man gets all the credit, looks like the cool guy/playboy, while the Chinaman is played for a fool and deemed the sidekick even though he does all the work/fighting. How about we reverse the roles... Make Jackie the ass- kicking playboy. Nope. Of course we will see him play a similar role in the sequel, as well as Rush Hour 1, 2, and 3. I would give it a 5, but I give it a higher rating mainly because I support Jackie for being one of the few successful Asians in Hollywood films, even though it's mainly due to his martial arts skills.

132,BlackVelvet88,Good movie with great acting but still lacks that thing that makes it memorable,8,9 August 2006,"Truth be told, I was expecting an incredibly dumb gay western film. But once I saw it, I was surprised at its good story structure and theme.Though I'm not a regular Jackie Chan fan, I actually enjoyed watching the guy in the film. Honestly, I don't know one bit about him, just that he's famous for doing martial arts films, and this is actually just the second film I've ever seen with him in it. And I've gotta say - not bad.And Owen Wilson was the perfect actor for his part. I mean seriously, nobody else could fit the role. He's not the best actor in the whole world, but he certainly took the right turn. He's got the looks, the attitude, the moves, the voice, and even the right hair. His character, Roy O'Bannon (a.k.a. Wyatt Earp) is a cool cowboy, robber, and gunman who's all wild west but still a bit wimpy for his taste. He is shown as ambitious and talented (in being a cowboy) but not hard or serious and thoroughly a slight disappointment to his land, like Chon Wang (Chan). Wilson was able to put both the toughy and the whiny in him in all the right parts and situations. He was even able to show the dynamic change O'Bannon went through at the end. He went from coward to hero without a flaw and still managed to be humorous. What I didn't like most of all was that they put background rock music in an 1881 setting. Sure, it didn't change the film much and the audience needed at least some connection with the modern world, but Wilson was already taking care of that. They at least could have taken out that ""Cowboy"" song, which is now stuck in my head, by the way!This sounds like a great movie, but as my title suggests, it's missing something. I don't know what it is. Perhaps it was the script, which was actually OK. The film somehow lacks that awe and ""wow"" that makes a movie memorable. Maybe it's just me, but that's the best I can verify it. Something's missing.Overall, it's an enjoyable film with great structure and form with a great theme. I hope you enjoy it. I sure did.

134,stavros-13,Rush Hour goes to the Wild west,8,3 August 2000,"Jackie Chan returns once again in the second of his ""team up with an American"" filmssince Rush Hour. This time he heads to the wild west to rescue his master's daughter from terrorist hands. Like all Jackie Chan films, Shanghai Noon contains a lot of humor, lightning fast kung-fu action and a cool attitude. I liked the fighting scenes which were extremely quick and well timed. Chan's cowboy side-kick provides half the laughs with his funny attitude and gun slinging action. The acting was good and so was the plot. The same can be said for the humor. The only complaint that I have is that the word s*** was used TOO extensively. Even the native americans used that word. All in all, Shanghai Noon should be able to bring back the laughs that Rush Hour provided, with the action packed fight scenes.",Shanghai Noon
135,musicbones,funny and endearing,8,11 November 2001,"If you are looking for a light action movie, try this one. It's photogenic and very funny. It's far better than the Rush Hour movies. Owen Wilson is a terrific comedic actor - a Bill Murray for the 2000s.",Shanghai Noon
136,MarkeyTheSparky,Brilliant!,8,16 August 2004,"Shanghai Noon is a good example of what Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson can do together on set. This isn't as good as it could of have been, although if they'd changed the bad bit then the film wouldn't have worked as well. As usual the choreography is amazing, and Owen Wilson does a great Roy O'Bannon. Owen usually works with Ben ""Zoolander"" Stiller, but this shows that he can blend just as well with any other actor. Jackie Chan doesn't have this problem, as he never works with the same people for long periods of films. Altogether this film does live up to it's standards as well as it being quite a bit better than it's sequel. As the acting and storyline are both very good, I would give this 4 stars.",Shanghai Noon
137,robbie-20,Owen Wilson almost steals this one!,10,27 May 2000,"Owen Wilson, the amazingly funny guy from ""Bottle Rocket"" plays a cooler, but just as dopey, Dignan in this very funny movie.  If Jackie Chan weren't so darn amazing to watch in his karate sequences, and pretty funny himself!, this would have been just fine with Owen alone.  Owen is up to his old ""gang"" leadership traits again, ala Bottle Rocket, saying things like, ""You're not in the gang anymore"", and ""I'm the one who likes to say that!"" (referring to one of his outlaw partners saying ""Stick 'em up"" during a train robbery before he got the chance to).  The twist at the end regarding Owen's character, ""Roy"" is a nice little treat as well!
This isn't a typical buddy movie, it's quirky, and very exciting in different ways.  Go watch Bottle Rocket for more of Owen Wilson and Rumble in the Bronx for more Jackie Chan...hell, go watch ""Shanghai Noon"" again, I know I will!",Shanghai Noon
138,gothic-child,Jackie's greatest movie made in Hollywood,10,3 September 2005,"Hmmm.....this movie is really gorgeous!! The scenery is amazing and full of colors. It is with no doubts the absolutely greatest Chan-movie made in America and Jackie himself is very proud at this masterpiece. It's really surprising that this movie had much lower success than Rush Hour when it's many times better. It's funnier, the fight scenes are way better and Jackie has much more charisma. And the chemistry between him and his sidekick Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) is perfect. I love the part when Jackie - after he saves an Indian boy from beating - gets stoned with the Indians and in the sudden delirium he gets married with the Indian chief's daughter. As a present he gets an originally trained horse, who later gets totally drunk when he drinks a full bottle of whiskey while waiting at the inn stable :-))) The movie contains great gags, some unexpected plot twists and fantastic martial art scenes. I think that even Jackie didn't expect he would be able to make such an amazing movie an America.",Shanghai Noon
139,ChineseBoxer,Rush Hour in Nevada,9,20 May 2000,"I found this to be a completely entertaining film.

141,UnclePaul,"thankfully, more like ""High Noon"" than ""Shanghai Surprise""",7,26 May 2000,"Going into ""Shanghai Noon"", I was a little worried.  I'm a big Jackie Chan fan, but would this film be more like ""High Noon"" (the classic Western with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly) or ""Shanghai Surprise"" (the awful film with Madonna and Sean Penn)?  Thankfully, it's funnier than one and a lot better than the other.  (I'll let you figure that one out.)  This certainly isn't Jackie's best film (rent ""Supercop"" if you've never seen it), but it's an awful lot of fun.  It lives up to the poster: The Classic Western Gets a Kick in the Pants.  The film covers all the Jackie standards--corny jokes, great physical comedy, and wonderfully inventive fight sequences.  Throw in a great sidekick, and you've got a good time at the movies.Jackie stars as Chon, an Imperial Guardsman in China's Forbidden City. When Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped and taken to Nevada, the 3 best guards are sent after her.  And Chon goes along to carry the interpreter's bags.  Once in Nevada, Chon meets up with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), and gets separated from the rest of his party.  Chon wanders through the West before finally arriving in Carson City.  Along the way, he and Roy form an unlikely partnership and team up to rescue the Princess.  With sadistic Marshall Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley) chasing them and roadroad tycoon slaver Lo Fong (Roger Yuan) holding the Princess, it won't be easy.The martial arts scenes are as good as expected: Jackie makes great use of any object he can lay his hands on, and always manages to use the surrounding environment to his benefit.  We've all seen Indians chasing down a cowboy, but you've never seen it end this way.  You'll also see a new spin on the 'unarmed man surrounded by 3 gunmen on a city street' scenario. And the final battle is much more inventive than a simple shoot-out.  Being a Western, of course there's a shoot-out: they just add a little something extra.There's also a high level of comedy throughout the film--fight scenes included.  That's where the chemistry between Jackie and Owen Wilson comes in.  Jackie hit paydirt using 'fish out of water' scenes with Chris Tucker in ""Rush Hour"", and you see the same things in ""Shanghai Noon"".  Wilson's Zen/Hippie/Surfer cowboy (who talks a great game as a gunfighter, but doesn't quite have the skills to back it up) plays nicely off Jackie's duty/honor/country warrior.  Their interactions are always easy to watch (unlike so many movies that try to force the 'buddy thing').  Wilson (who had many great lines in ""Armageddon"") and Jackie obviously had a lot of fun, and it's evident in their performances.  Liu (""Ally McBeal"", the upcoming ""Charlie's Angels"") and Berkeley do good things with their limited parts, but I'd watch Liu in just about anything!  One problem: I was never really interested in Yuan's character.  I expected more out of the main bad guy--call it ""Gladiator"" syndrome.Other than that, I had a few other problems with the film.  In this day and age, I just don't see the point of drug and alcohol used as humor.  ""Look, I'm high"" and ""Look, I'm drunk"" just don't do it for me.  There were enough funny moments in this film to carry the humor--they didn't need to take the easy way out as often as they did.  I also thought the use of modern slang coming from the Indians was funny at first, but they really overdid it.One thing I have to mention: play close attention to the names in the film. Jackie is given names by the Indians, the makers of Wanted posters, and by Roy.  Marshall Van Cleef's name pays homage to Spaghetti Western star Lee Van Cleef (""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly"" and ""For A Few Dollars More""). And Roy's real name is clever indeed.""Shanghai Noon"" is an excellent Summer Movie, worthy of 3 stars (out of 4). Good action, lots of laughs, and actors/characters that you enjoy watching. And make sure you stay around for the outtakes during the closing credits (another Jackie standard).",Shanghai Noon

Easy jokes, ridiculous story and a setting (19th century Wild West) that just doesn't become Jackie Chan. This ultimate collection of cliches (yawn) is interrupted by several action scenes which are, as usual, the highlights of the film. However, most action scenes are hardly original and Chan only succeeds in impressing the viewer in one or two scenes. The real higlight of the film is ZZ Top's La Grange.

148,Bernie-58,"Better story-line, fewer fights - still a marvelous Jackie Chan",7,20 October 2000,"If you watch this movie for the same reasons you watched Jackie Chan movies before, you might be disappointed - or not.Given, there are Jackie Chan movies with a larger and longer firework of fighting scenes. But on the other hand, there are few Jackie Chan movies where the plot in itself carries the movie better than this does.Shanghai Noon relies not only on the fighting scenes, which are scarcer than before, but on the story-line itself: and what a story-line it is: Jackie Chan fighting his way through the American Wild-West to free his princess, dealing on the way with a partner-turned-villain, struggling with a renitent horse and always being saved by his omnipresent sharp-shooting Indian wife.
The movie is therefore really enjoying without relying too much on the fighting scenes, which -as always- introduce a lot of novelties into martial arts (especially the Indian and saloon scenes). Add to this the usual Jackie Chan tongue-in-cheek humor -this time fueled by East-West contrasts- and a feast for the eyes called Lucy Liu and you're up to a really enjoying movie.By the way: from the few fighting actions Lucy Liu delivers, a lot can be expected of her for ""Charlie's Angels""....",Shanghai Noon

I wondered throughout if I was watching the same film as everyone else. I usually love Jackie Chan's films, but it seemed to me as if this was more of the same material, particularly in the fighting sequences. And for a comedy I didn't seem to laugh all that much, nor did I see many around me laughing with enthusiasm either. Perhaps I let the broken chair I was sitting on, the guy with the big head right in front of me, and the subtly out of focus screening taint my viewing pleasure, but maybe because of my high expectations, I found myself only disappointed.",Shanghai Noon

I don't think it is even worth mentioning that both the editing and cinematography were at times startlingly bad, or that the plot line (which is full of holes) was completely predictable and stupid. These things we would of course expect. The so called humor is also bad. Virtually every joke in this film is recycled. I've seen them all used (better) before. Also, the writing for this movie is soooo bad. Laughably so. (Yes, I did laugh a few times during this, but it was only when I couldn't believe just how bad it was). The writer must think very lowly of his audience. Not only are his characters completely implausible, saying and doing stupid things, but at times the film is completely irrational.",Shanghai Noon

These, combined with Jackie's now-familiar low-impact violence, good-natured humor, and a quite engaging story made it one of the more enjoyable experiences at the theater in a while.In many ways, this film's spirit reminded me as much of ""Cat Ballou"" as previous Jackie Chan flicks.

If you like silly comedies with a lot of physical humor, maybe this movie is for you. This movie was so badly put together that it could hardly be considered a movie.  People fight for no reason. At the end two people who should be helping each other fight the ""Bad"" guys end up fighting each other so they can have more fighting scenes. The indian girl is there for no reason except to bail Jackie out of the silly predicaments he gets into. She doesn't appear except to do this. If this movie was just a collection of Jackie fight scenes it would be okay, but it gives out the pretense of being a real movie with a plot.This movie uses every stereotype of the wild west, and the far east as seen by the west.I might be considered humorless but I am not a big fan of the 3 stooges meet kung fu.

Shanghai Noon is also much more humorous than Rush Hour, as Chan and Wilson's more subtle humor show in accordance, rather than Chan and Tucker's humor in opposition. If you're into the fight scenes, you will cringe plenty at the appearance of what damage is being done (however, Jackie seems to be a bit light on the stunts...except for that scene where he falls from the bell tower... ouch... watch for that). Although there are some holes in the story (where does his wife go when they ride into town? Chong Wang has a wife that makes like cameo appearances whenever she feels like it, and then they ditch her again), that won't stop you from enjoying it, as long as you suspend disbelief as you always should with these types of movies.

I like Jackie Chan's demeanor when he is filming his movies, the out-takes at the end are always a trip to watch.  Chan's character comes to America seeking a Chinese Imperial Princess who ran away, at least thats what she thought she was doing.  He comes across an outlaw in a train robbery who plagues him while he's searching for the princess.  Chan experiences a cacophony of American life when he witnesses an old fashioned gun standoff, gets married to an indian squaw and becomes friends with ""Wyatt Earp.""Good movie, a 7 in my list.",Shanghai Noon
158,gamemastereric,A good movie with some oversights (spoilers),7,7 January 2018,"If you make the assumption that this is going to be a funny, wild movie, then you are absolutely correct.The movie is centered on the adventures of an imperial guard of the Qing dynasty in the late 19th century who travels to the new world with his uncle and some other Imperial guards in hopes of rescuing a Manchu princess. Jackie as an Imperial guard could have been quite interesting: An imperial guard who holds the utmost loyalty to the emperor, but doesn't mind going out of his way to serve, even if it means disobeying his dismissive superiors. It is very unfortunate that we did not see more of Jackie in the forbidden city, as the intrigue and plotting that occurred in the forbidden city is a subject that could have very easily created an interesting opening with a lot more action and comedy. Instead, the movie uses Jackie's role as an imperial guard simply as a way of explaining why the plot progresses in the first place, and nothing more. This results in a shallow opening for the movie.After the opening, the plot shifts the focus towards Owen. Owen's character is portrayed as an incompetent, naive bandit who loves money and women.
Owen does his role amazingly, but his role may not have been the best role to include to begin with. The main reason he is even really alive is because he is ridiculously lucky (a villain later asks Owen's character how he's even been able to stay alive, which I also must ask). The fact that Owen's character is essentially useless results in a character that feels very forced and underwhelming.
He practically gets carried around by Jackie's character throughout the entire movie until he ends up saving Jackie's life because Jackie's character, for whatever reason, decided that it was a good idea to publicly kowtow to the princess in the middle of the villain's compound -- while the villain was there, of all things. The only reason this ever happened, I assume, was to allow a transition so that Owen's character would finally become useful for something.Jackie's choreography is wonderful, and in addition, some of the other actors perform solid choreography. The imperial guards, the princess, and the traitor all did very well. Unfortunately, the entertainment provided by this action is all undermined by several things in particular.
Saying the gun fights and standoffs are disappointing is an understatement. They simply could not have been any more underwhelming. This is part of the more broad problem that they handled Owen's fight scenes very poorly.
They also split up the action scenes too much, which only intensified the problems I just mentioned. It was very annoying having to switch from watching Owen's character standing there sweating nervously to watching Jackie go ham on some guys with chain whip techniques every 6 or 7 seconds. I was essentially just waiting for Owen's clips to end so I could keep watching Jackie fight, and that sometimes made me feel like I was only watching half of a movie. As I said before, they should have handled Owen's fight scenes much better.But I've been talking about things that some other people might not care about. If you're just looking for a funny movie, then there are many people who would love this. I was originally recommended this movie by friends who were praising the comedic value of the movie, and I can't disagree with them.
In short, the comedy is present, but the action is sometimes very lacking. Sadly, this ended up not being anything too special. I still think that it is a 7/10 because it would be a shame to overlook the comedy elements, as well as the efforts of Jackie and some of the other actors.",Shanghai Noon
159,Armand-3,A more than worthy successor to Rush Hour -,9,18 May 2000,"WARNING! Contains mild SPOILERS - read at own riskJackie Chan's back again, and this time he's in the Old West. Jackie's latest entry into American film is even better than his first attempt (first, that is of his 'new' American works) Rush Hour. Full of action, comedy, beautiful scenery and an amazing horse, Shanghai Noon proves once and for all that Jackie Chan is here to stay. With humor on level with City Hunter, a partner (Owen Wilson) who works just as well as Michelle Yeoh in Police Story III, and action scenes (not including one bar fight) easily on par with Police Story IV's final two fights, Shanghai Noon succeeds and succeeds well.The film does, however unfortunately start off slow, and to truly die hard fans of Jackie Chan the first 25-30 minutes have a very strong ""doesn't feel like a Jackie film"" feeling to it. At first I was worried Jackie had some how ended up with another film like The Protector. However, after this slow start, the film takes off, and pulls you in for a wonderful ride. A few of the comic highlights involve Jackie's amazing horse, a horse shoe used in a fight, and a gun battle during the finale of the film. The fights, except for the one mentioned earlier are all very well choreographed, and it is clear that many of the stand ins must be Jackie Chan's Stunt Boys. Try to spot Yuen Biao (one of Jackie's boyhood companion at the Opera academy), as I totally missed him. The stunts in this film are at a minimum compared to Jackie's earlier works (remember the ouch in Armour of God), and at least one appears to have blue screened, but all is easily forgivable, as Jackie was nearly 46 at the time of filming. All in all a great film. I gave it a 9 out of 10 due to the opening 25 or so minutes, but a definite success for Jackie.As a final note: It is well known that this story had been in Jackie's mind many years, but he does not appear to have been given any writeing or story credits from what I noticed. I hope I just missed it, but if I did not then I feel that this is a great disservice to one of the most successful director/actors of our time.",Shanghai Noon

It wasn't just a weak-plotted Jackie Chan action flik (which can be a lot of fun, too).  There was more to it. Sometimes when you throw a lot of money at an idea for a movie, the movie is ruined in the making.  Not so for this one--it definitely benefited from a bigger bank.I have to say that one thing about the movie towards the end (that I can't mention cause it's a spoiler) really bummed me out--enough to score it down to a 7 instead of an 8 or 9.  You see, they tied all the pieces up neatly at the end, but in a way that rubbed me the wrong way and left me feeling disappointed.

The film follows the standard ""rescue"" plot, and is almost a Western ""Rush Hour"".The cultural differences between East and West play a more defining role here, and helps take this movie a bit higher.

170,Punster,This is one of Jackie Chan's best films!,10,30 March 2003,"If you're looking for a serious western, check out ""High Noon.""  However, if you are looking for a combination western buddy picture, wry and slapstick comedy and a martial arts display, this here's your movie, Pard'ner.  The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan just clicks, and with a cute script that pokes fun at the clichés and traditions of the Western genre, ""Shanghai Noon"" is an extremely enjoyable film.  Xander Berkeley does a nice job as a lawman that just will not give up his quarry.  Lucy Liu, whom we all know has wonderful talents, appears held back by her limited role in the script, and I wonder why the writers didn't flesh out her role a bit better. All of the other cast members just blend into the Western sets, which is a big disappointment in the case of Brandon Merrill - I would have liked to see her given more than just two lines!""Shanghai Noon"" is certainly not the first 'East-meets-Western' movie, but in my opinion, it's the funniest!  I highly recommend it!",Shanghai Noon

It's not as good as some of Jackie's other films (Rush Hour and Rumble in the Bronx are my personal favorites), but it's definitely worth the price of a ticket if you like either Chan or westerns.

Owen Wilson excels as Chan's cowboy ""guru"" and will have enhanced his credentials as a comedy actor. The historical significance of the exploitation of Chinese in labour camps was not really brought to the viewer's attention, I think a lot of people who watch the film will just accept it as a fictional addition to the plot. This film has got the lot: guns and dynamite, Indians and Chinamen, sherrifs and monks and even a whisky drinking horse ! It achieves exactly what it set out to; a serving of kicks, spins, chops and punches with a few laughs on the side. 'Rush Hour' meets 'Rawhide'.

174,southhampton,It's great and exciting,10,28 May 2000,Jackie's new idea to bring the Imperial China mixing with totally different elements such as the American west and American aborigines to the film is perhaps one of the rarest ones for us to see. His Kung-Fu is cool enough to make me excited when it's performed in the wild west of America and there is a lot of hilarity without a doubt. It's almost a faultless Jackie film ever. Great work for Jackie and it's really funny. I can endorse that(I saw that twice but I still don't regret). This will be a rare kind of Jackie film and holding a permanently good value for Jackie film lovers.,Shanghai Noon

177,king-53,Wow...never judge a movie by its trailer.,8,6 July 2000,"By all accounts, this movie should have been bad.  I mean, it's a Western...a COMEDIC Western, featuring a Chinese martial arts expert who arrives in the West to beat up a bunch of stupid hicks while getting advice from your atypical blonde cowboy on how to survive from the West.  At least, that's what one would gather from the trailer.However, the actual movie itself has a solid plot with plenty of interesting characters thrown in.  The humor is simplistic, yet at the same time doesn't go into the realm of stupid or idiotic (re: the now-defunct TV series ""Working"").  The martial arts sequences are beautifully choreographed, which is to be expected of any Chan film.  The cowboy Roy O'Bannon, played by Owen Wilson, is surprisingly effective as comic relief: a wannabe cowboy who is ignorant of the life itself and acts as an expert while dispensing advice on the ""cowboy life"" most likely inferred from the reading of dime ovels.I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this film.  Not exactly Oscar material, but if you're really bored and with a group of friends, I heavily recommend this film.  You won't be disappointed.

There's this Cowboy named ""Roy""(Owen Wilson) who would make a fantastic `life coach' but needs therapy himself; and a loyal, yet somewhat overzealous and almost unstoppable royal bag handler named Chon Wang who takes on the task.The mysterious and loyal Indian wife is my favourite character in this saga and not just for her looks.

181,exxos77,Very much *unlike* Rush Hour,2,10 August 2000,"Everyone seems to agree that Shanghai Noon has a lot in common with Rush Hour. Jackie Chan arrives in a country that is alien to him, to rescue a young princess (close enough...), and is shown around by a local American whose every moves are the exact opposite of Chan's.Well, Rush Hour was the first Jackie Chan movie I saw, and I loved it so much that I was really sad not to have known his movies before. Then I saw Shanghai Noon and hated it.What I thought about Rush Hour after seeing it was that the movie seemed to have been made for fun, and by that I mean the actors' and crew's fun. It seemed the movie had been made without trying to convey this or that emotion, but for the mere fun of doing it. On the other hand, Shanghai Noon seems to be the result of a precise market study, like if the average viewer's tastes had been analysed and the movie made to fulfil those tastes. Example: There seemed to be someone that decided there should be a native American girl in the plot. But then, nobody could put her to a good use so she just made guest appearances throughout the movie with no good reason.The plot was jumping around and full of useless inclusions, the scenes with the native Americans were trying, the bad guys didn't have any depth, the fights, although wonderfully choreographed, lacked some fun (remember the vase scene at the end of Rush Hour?) and it seemed even Chan was tired of his role.Last but not least, Owen Wilson was far from reaching the wonderful contrast between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker...All in all, this movie was a great disappointment. Now I have to see Chan's old movies to make an opinion for myself.",Shanghai Noon

Every film he stars in is an exercise in demonstrating his skill in different, creative ways.  If you go to see this movie expecting anything different, you'll be sorely disappointed.However, if you're a Chan fan, prepare to be amazed once again.  It's not the same spectacle one would find in previous works such as Rumble in the Bronx, but impressive nevertheless.  Furthermore, the plot that ties these action sequences together is better than can be found in most films of the same genre.  The clash between far east and wild west cultures and cinematographic stereotypes is amusing enough to keep the film entertaining throughout, and Chan's own tongue-in-cheek sense of humor makes the piece that much more delightful to watch.Don't look for this one at the next Academy Awards, but then that's not what Jackie Chan is all about, is it.

I'm always waiting in anticipation for the next action scene.  Not with ""Shanghai Noon"".  There is a lot of great action and the story is incredibly funny and entertaining.  Jackie Chan is his usual funny self.  In this movie it's easy to see why he is so often compared to Buster Keaton.

Jackie Chan's own 'Mathew Perry like' physical comedy and jokes, 2. Chan's magestical fight sequences, 3. Outstandingly nutty stunt work and 4. A great script. And yes my friends, this film has them all. Fair enough some people may comment on the fact that the kidnapped princess routine has been done many times before and yes it has, but this film does not just focus on that one aspect of the script. The story takes many different paths which are all hilarious and all come together to build the film and end up in a very satisfying ending. Admittedly the parts where Chan and Wilson aren't on camera are a bit boring but during the parts which they are you will not be able to stop laughing. 10/10.",Shanghai Noon
187,jem-1,"Best martial arts movie...ever! (sorry Crouching Tiger, Bruce Lee)",9,26 March 2004,"Shang Hai Noon is one of those rare movies that transcends several genres.The comedy is first rate with Jackie Chan playing straight man to Owen Wilson's fantastic ""clown"". (For American movies, these are Jackie's best roles -- e.g. Rush Hour).The martial arts is some of the best I have ever seen. Having practiced MA for 16 years, I can say that this is the REAL THING. It's tough to pick a favorite fight scene; there are three specific ones which are each very special.The Horseshoe Scene, though, is one of the best examples (ever) of Jackie Chan's talent -- it's one of the most difficult forms in all of MA and he absolutely nails it.Fight coordinator Yuen Biao is significantly more imaginative and true to the Form than many (any?) of his colleagues, including Yuen Wo Ping (many Jet Li's films and Crouching Tiger, Hidden [Wires, oops] Dragon). If there was any ""wire-work"" in this movie, it certainly wasn't obvious.(I must state here that I am not a fan of the absolute brutality which is emphasized by Jet Li, Steven Segal or many of the others. If you enjoy brutality, this film isn't for you.)While the martial arts is spectacular, it is just one component of a very good film. The direction and editing are quite notable. There are several parallel storylines which are interlaced very nicely. Also, several of the action scenes have parallel events which come together seamlessly. The whole movie has very nice ""flow"" to it.The acting is also first-rate. Roger Yuan, Xander Berkeley, and Walt Groggins are each great villains (both believable and despicable). Lucy Liu is quite regal (as well as drop-dead gorgeous) as the princess Pei-pei.Even the music is great and well-timed to dramatize the corresponding sequences.I will say that some of the comedy is a bit 'cornball', but it's all in good fun.Overall, I would say this movie is quite simply a whole lot of fun.9 out of 10!",Shanghai Noon

The basic premise of the movie is the same as in Chan's 'Rush Hour'-- Foreigner comes to States to rescue kidnapped victim, cultures clash, and lots of Chan's original style of action/fight scenes occur....The difference between Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon, is the lack of Chris Tucker... which allows Chan's subtler form of humor to shine.

Fans of the typical Jackie Chan movie will still be entertained by his amazing stunts, but Jackie has never been funnier.  The story isn't much more than an excuse to see Owen and Jackie in action, but they more than make up for a somewhat weak plot and other minor, underdeveloped characters.

I have seen almost everyone of his movies. And I could always see why Jackie Chan, being the true entertainer he is (as oppossed to a flash in the pan many action stars are)could not make a successful movie here. he is more interested in making his fans happy than he is caring for his own health and fattening his wallet. Well, Shanghai Noon has it all. The script is well written. The action scenes are worth the ticket alone. Owen Wilson was perfectly cast for this part... adding more comedy than Chris Tucker did in Rush Hour. I was happy to see that many of the odd moments incorporated into Chan's films were left out. Such as extremely stupid ""bad guys"", those cartoonish faces the ""bad guys"" make when getting hit and just the plan bad stereotypes his enemies always seem to be modeled after. My only complaint of this movie is that some of the action scenes had too many cuts. The sheer fun of a Jackie Chan movie is watching him do his thing with a minimum of cuts during the scene. He moves too fast to fully appreciate his ability in a scene with too many cuts. However, this is made up with one spectacular scene in the end. I saw this movie at a sneak preview which was sold out. When the final credits rolled, the audience cheered and applauded.

200,bwill,"Chan produces a solid action-comedy, but one that doesn't really benefit from the big screen.",8,4 June 2000,"Jackie Chan returns with his second, big-money American production and this one is even better than the first (Rush Hour). Chan knows himself and his movies, and he sticks to his strengths in Shanghai Noon, and produces a solid action-comedy, but one that doesn't really benefit from the big screen.Chan is Imperial Guard Chong Wang (say it aloud fast) who is the baggage carrier for a delegation sent from the Forbidden City to the American West to rescue a kidnapped princess. Early in the film, Wang is separated from the rest of the delegation and ends up unwillingly partnered with bumbling outlaw Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). As the two continue on to rescue the princess, much of Chan's signature fight scenes and comedic bumblings are spoon-fed to the audience.Chan knows his strengths are inventive fight scenes mixed with doses of humor. In an early fight with Crow Indians, Chan throws hatchets at the warriors, only to see them plucked out of the air and returned at him. The wide-eyed surprise on Chan's face, coupled with his hasty retreat, is funny material. Later, in the camp of friendly Indians, Chan gets high on a peace pipe, while the Indian leaders insult him in their native tongue.That was one of the many things that leant realism to this film. Costuming, historical depictions of the old West, and language all give this film a sense of having really happened. Chan liberally sprinkles Chinese and Native American among the English, using subtitles as appropriate. Except for one scene at the end of the film, no one uses English who should not be using English.And no one uses English better than Wilson. His inept cowboy doesn't even realize how bad he is; rather, he spends his time congratulating himself on how smarter he is than the run-of-the mill outlaw. Like Chris Tucker in Rush Hour, Wilson is the comedian to Chan's straight man. He keeps up a running patter throughout the film, but unlike Tucker, his patter is streamed in a low, soft voice with minimal use of profanity.Director Tom Dey shows a deft touch as he mostly stays out of Chan's way. He gives the martial arts star plenty of room to move and showcase the amazing stuntwork that has propelled Chan from Hong Kong to Hollywood. Chan uses traditional Chinese weaponry, evergreens, moose antlers and horseshoes with equal dexterity. The wild West gives Chan plenty of opportunity to showcase his creativity, and he takes every advantage.The only real downside to this film is that nothing is sized for theatrical release. The FX are minimal--the stars are Chan's stuntwork and Wilson's mouth, not the action. The scenery is mostly muted, and the Western vistas few and far between. This film will look much the same on video as it did on the big screen. Which is, when you think about it, fortunate. This is a film that you'll want to see many times over because Jackie Chan is always fresh, active and funny.",Shanghai Noon
