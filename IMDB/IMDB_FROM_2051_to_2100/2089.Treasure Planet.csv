0,MartinHafer,My daughter loved it...I didn't.,3,26 August 2014,"I only saw ""Treasure Planet"" last night--well over a decade after it debuted. Most of this is because I really dislike ""Treasure Island"", the story on which it is based. I am not sure if it's because the book is bad, but I've simply seen too many versions and I wish Hollywood would put a moratorium on it. This problem is even worse with ""A Christmas Carol""--an all too familiar story and too many versions have been made. However, just the day before I saw ""Muppet Treasure Island"" and loved it, so I thought I'd try ""Treasure Planet""--mostly because the same daughter that got me to watch this Muppet movie also loved ""Treasure Planet"".Well, although I love Sarah and respect her opinions (in most cases), I was NOT especially fond of this film. But, in order to spare her, I just smiled and said nothing when the movie was complete. So, if you are reading this, DON'T tell her I reviewed the film!!The story is basically the plot from the famous story, although it's set in a weird anachronistic future world. Although they have space travel and lasers, so much looks like 18th century Britain. This didn't make sense, but it really didn't bother me. It also looked like the old Dreamcast/PS2 game ""Skies of Arcadia""--about a futuristic world with weird sailing ships that flew across the skies...filled with pirates. I could accept this, strange as it was. I also could accept the very strange animation. While the combination of 2D hand-drawn characters, CGI and what Disney calls 'Deep Canvas' is odd, it's also very striking and would have looked great as a 3D film. What bothered me about the film were two things. First, it was too much like the original story and offered few surprises. ""Muppet Treasure Island"" worked because it took many liberties with the story--and helped to make it seem new. It also was quite funny. Little about ""Treasure Island"" seemed new or funny...just tiresome. Second, and most importantly, it featured some of the most unlikable characters in Disney history. With the possible exception of Gurgi from ""The Black Cauldron"", B.E.N. from ""Treasure Planet"" is the most annoying and unappealing character in the history of the studio. Every time he talked, I wanted SOMEONE to shoot him in order to shut him up--he was THAT annoying!! Another difficult to like character was Long John Silver--a serious problem since he is one of the most noticeable character in the story. He's a weird cyborg...and I just didn't understand why they did this to him. With a million and one gadgets popping out of his cyborg arm, I just found this to be a major distraction for the character. A few other characters were also quite annoying but they weren't major characters in the film--such as the slug-like thing that made farting noises and Ben Bones. I hated them but they were used sparingly, so I could handle their annoying personalities. So, overall, despite inventive animation, I was left really bored and unhappy with this movie due to the writing. I also noticed that most reviewers really loved it or really hated it--I happened to be one who hated it.",Treasure Planet
1,TheLittleSongbird,Very well done animated film!,8,13 May 2009,"Sure it isn't perfect, but then again, few movies are. The visuals are a delight to look at, with a wide range of colours, and the art direction is much better than it is in most direct to video sequels. The music is lovely too, not the best score in the world, but I liked it. However, the story is very overly-familiar and some of the characters aren't quite as convincing as others. Be thankful that the voice talents are so good, like Tony Jay lending his distinguished voice as the narrator. Emma Thompson is lovely as Amelia and makes the most of some witty dialogue, and David Hyde Pierce impresses as well. Martin Short is good as BEN but his character isn't quite as appealing as the others, Morph was one of my favourites. I liked the idea of making Silver a cyborg, and Brian Murray does a respectable job, and Jim, while slightly bland to start with was appealing. All in all, a well done animated film, that is only let down by slightly unoriginal plotting. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Treasure Planet
2,SnoopyStyle,don't really like the color palette,6,25 May 2015,"As a boy, Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was enthralled by the legendary space pirate Captain Flint in the story of Treasure Planet. As an older teenager, Jim is rebellious and restless. He reluctantly works at the family inn with his mother. A spaceship crashes near the inn and the pilot gives Jim a sphere. Pirates come to burn down their inn. Jim, his mother and Dr. Delbert Doppler manage to escape. The sphere turns out to be a map to Treasure Planet. Doppler hires RLS Legacy, on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by Captain Amelia with her trusted First Mate Mr. Arrow. However Amelia is suspicious of the questionable crew hired by Doppler. Jim is suspicious of the cyborg cook John Silver and starts working with him and his shapeshifting pet Morph.The movie is a blend of traditional 2D and CGI 3D. The color is more dull and filled with browns. I think the color palette won't interest the smaller kids. The use of rock music and the male lead won't interest most female audience. This does not have the Disney sing-along songs. The script is fine but holds limited interest. It tries to hook the kids with big explosive action sequences.",Treasure Planet
3,jboothmillard,Treasure Planet,2,10 August 2009,"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, probably one of the most constantly remade films ever, one again gets another this time with this Disney animated re-visioning of the story. Set in space with aliens and future technology, this sees teenager Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) get a capsule from dying Billy Bones (Patrick McGoohan), containing instructions of a journey through space to Treasure Planet. So Jim, accompanied by Dr. Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) find the ship (space ship looking like a sea ship) with Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) at the helm. Before dying, Bones warned Jim of the cyborg, and he meets him in the ship's cook, John Silver (Brian Murray), who guides him with his work as cabin boy. So the ship travels across galaxies and a black hole, and before the even reach the planet with Captain Nathaniel Flint's treasure is on, Silver and his gang make their move to get it all for themselves. They find the treasure eventually in the centre of the planet, and in the end, Jim lets Silver get away, but not with some of the treasure, the rest was lost, and Jim returns home. Also starring Michael Wincott as Scroop, Martin Short as B.E.N., Toy Story's Laurie Metcalf as Sarah Hawkins, Dane A. Davis as Morph, Roscoe Lee Browne as Mr. Arrow, Corey Burton as Onus and Michael McShane as Hands, with narration by The Jungle Book 2's Tony Jay. The animation is a little tame compared to past Disney cartoon films, the added characters (obviously for the kids) are annoying and slow things down at times, in fact, the whole thing is ludicrous, they shouldn't be messing with the pirate story format. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Pretty poor!",Treasure Planet

5,ComedyFan2010,Sci Fi version of Treasure Island,7,30 April 2018,"Once again I discovered a movie that makes me surprised I haven't heard of it before. Apparently it flopped. Why, I don't know. It really is a pretty decent animation movie.It takes the old story about the Treasure Island that is loved by many and transfers it into space. Now this is where I have some complaints. I mainly watched the movie because of it. As a child I loved outer space stories and seeing a beloved adventure in outer space could be awesome. But for some reason it really doesn't feel like an outer space adventure. It still all looks like the old setting just with some characters looking like they are not from Earth. This kind of disappointed me personally. I wish they went further and made it more of a space adventure.But other than that it is a pretty good movie. We have the male protagonist trying to find himself and his destiny. And we have some other characters that help him on this adventure. We get some even to wonder about if they are good or bad.The animation is done really good, the voices are well selected and I absolutely liked the fighting and chasing sequences that were done in a very beautiful way,I have no doubts most kids will like the movie unless they also won't have enough of the space in it.",Treasure Planet
6,dbborroughs,Someday This Will Be Hailed as a Great Film,9,26 March 2004,"Somewhere along the way this film got lost. I'm inclined to think that Disney buried this film on purpose since it opened at exactly the same time as the latest Harry Potter film. This was the film that, according to Disney, the future of traditional animation hung, and they went out of their way to bury it, going so far as to declare it a failure even before the first days grosses came out.The reputation of this film is bad, which is a shame since its actually quite a good film. Yes, the idea of Treasure Island in space does tend to put one off on the face of it, but the film does everything it can to change that for the viewer once you actually watch it.This is a perfectly cast. I must single out Brian Murray's Performance as Long John Silver. It is the first time I ever thought seriously that a voice actor should be nominated for an Oscar. Its simply one of the high points in all of animated film history.The film that looks great, all the designs are based on the classic illustrators like Pyle, Wyeth and the others of that ilk and focused through their spiritual child of Tom Kidd. The animation is amazing, a brilliant mix of traditional and computer styles that compliment each other nicely.The story telling is of the classic swashbuckling style and draws you in instantly with a battle between ships and then never lets up, well it's fine until it hits the bump about the time that Martin Short comes in and things try to be too grand towards the end. Still the movie gets back on track and finishes off nicely.Don't believe the negative hype, see this film and be pleasantly surprised.",Treasure Planet
7,zetes,Surprisingly excellent!,8,9 September 2012,"The second Disney animated feature to be released in 2002, after the much better liked Lilo & Stitch. I like that one a lot, too, but I was surprised that I liked this one even more. Yeah, a sci-fi, animated Treasure Island by late-period Disney shouldn't be that good, I would think, but this is a lot of fun. The animation is gorgeous (except for maybe a couple of instances of poorly-integrated CGI within the hand-drawn animation). The character design especially is awesome, with a great, cyborg Long John Silver, whose right arm can transform into a number of different tools and weapons. I also loved all the monstrous pirates, especially the spider guy and, God help me, the amusing creature from the planet Flatula, who communicates in fart sounds (it's less crass than it sounds). The action sequences are great, and it even works emotionally. The cast is also top-notch, with a post-3rd Rock from the Sun, pre-Mysterious Skin Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing the teenage Jim Hawkins. David Hyde Pierce plays his nerdy scientist sidekick and Emma Thompson the captain of the ship. Brian Murray voices John Silver. The one big flaw is that Disney still felt compelled to include obnoxious sidekicks, notably the morphing alien pet of John Silver (who isn't too bad by himself) and the robot spazz B.E.N. (Martin Short), who thankfully appears late in the film (I did love the animation on that character, though). Frankly, I like this film (and Lilo & Stitch) far better than anything in the so-called Disney Renaissance of the late 80s and 90s. Man, I watched 20 minutes of Aladdin the other day and had to shut it off.",Treasure Planet
8,siderite,One of the last true Disney animations?,9,17 July 2020,"This movie can be seen as a blend of the old and the new on every level. It is a remake of the classic Treasure Island book, but it's set in space (or a sort of space-like universe). It blends classically hand-drawn animation with CG. It features the good old tried tropes of Disney stories, including endearing but rather unfashionable approaches to human relationships (see the strong female character getting hitched with the one male who stands up to her). It flopped when it was released, but it is a rather fun adventure aimed at older children.I think the animation was good, the story was very well adapted and the weird seafaring space universe beautiful and consistent. I liked the characters and the voices, even the young boy lead, who doesn't do much other than being young and energetic.In conclusion, I would recommend it warmly for three categories of people: Disney nostalgics, parents with kids, animation fans. It is a good film!",Treasure Planet
9,KineticSeoul,"Not awful, but far from being exciting",5,2 February 2015,"All I can say is, this would have worked as a video game or just a Saturday morning cartoon. But as a movie is falls short. It's simply a forgettable adventure that does bring hardly anything when it comes to the brain or emotion. The movie has spectacular visuals for when this movie came out, but that is basically all that is going for it. The plot moves from point A to point B to point c but in the most cliché and generic manner. Everything about this movie is just so darn predictable. I personally think this movie is not viewed and not very well known for a reason. The movie has pirates and spaceships and it still comes off bland. It's not a awful movie, but it's far from being exciting.5.8/10",Treasure Planet
10,OllieSuave-007,Average mix of sci-fi and the classic story.,6,14 August 2015,"Disney's 43st full-length animated feature film is a story about the classic story of Treasure Island, but with the backdrop set in outer space.This movie brings back The Little Mermaid directors Ron Clements and John Musker, who gave us quite an adventurous movie full of sci-fi action and drama. While I thought the reason behind the co-habiting of humans beings and space aliens should be explained more, the characters somehow worked in the film. The animation wasn't as colorful or vibrant as in earlier animated pieces in the Disney canon, but it is serviceable. The visual effects, particularly for the action and adventures scenes, were quite mesmerizing.The plot, though, does take a long while to gain any steam and nothing really captures your interest until the treasure hunt kicks into high gear toward the middle of the movie. The characters also take quite a long while to develop, but the concept of paving your own path in life, as John Silver suggests Jim Hawkins do, and Jim wanting to find the treasure to help his mother rebuild her business are good strong points that drive the movie.The movie doesn't stick out as iconic or captivating as earlier Disney movies do like those from the Walt Era and the Renaissance Era, but it's still not too bad to watch at least once.Grade C",Treasure Planet
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Hoist the colours!,7,13 April 2021,"Disney's futuristic adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Treasure Island' takes a while to get going, but it eventually settles into itself and becomes a rather fun time. Though some of its early-2000s CG animation looks a little wonky (especially when compared to the consistently wonderful 2D stuff), 'Treasure Planet (2002)' is filled with inventive visuals and exciting set-pieces. Its core story is relatively resonant and its characters are somewhat nuanced. The latter is especially true of the relationship between protagonist Jim Hawkins and antagonist/ father figure John Silver, which is the most interesting aspect of the film by far. It's an entertaining experience that doesn't actually feel all that typically 'Disney', which may be why it's often overlooked when discussing the studio's most successful work. For me, this easily sits somewhere within the top third of Disney's animated catalogue. It's an enjoyable, well-crafted affair throughout. 7/10.",Treasure Planet
12,ThomasDrufke,A Little Uneven But It Has Heart,6,30 August 2019,"I have many gaps in my film watching history with classics, horror, and several famous comedies, but I don't have a ton with Disney films. Treasure Planet is a movie I apparently never got around to as a kid, but I've always heard good things so I figured I might as well give it a shot. Unfortunately, I can certainly see why the movie never made a significant dent in box office or with audiences as the years went on. It's an average, mostly uneven story that we've seen before and done better. With that said, it does have a ton of heart, solid animation (mix of hand drawn and CG), and a standout score from James Newton Howard. But it's not something I will necessarily revisit any time soon.6.4/10",Treasure Planet
13,paulclaassen,A Kid's movie...,4,7 June 2019,"Which young kid doesn't dream of going on a treasure hunt? Sure they do! As promising a premise as the film has, I couldn't find myself enjoying it as much as I wanted to. Mainly due to the fact the animation was not your typical Disney feature film quality. Instead, it had a very cartoonish look and feel. The silly humor also made me think I was watching a cartoon.The characters and plot is well set-up and the film offers lots of action and excitement. Despite this, though, the silliness was overwhelming, rendering the film nothing more than a kid's cartoon. Kids will enjoy it for the sheer adventure.Despite receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, the film was a big box office bomb. Got it wrong (again), Oscars...",Treasure Planet
14,briancham1994,Not worth it,6,24 August 2020,"This film was part of Disney's early 2000s experimentation with science fiction (think Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Lilo & Stitch). While I love this genre, Treasure Planet didn't really do it for me. While the updated characters are visually memorable, they are not given interesting personalities to match. The animation is alright and the designs are strange anachronisms combining futuristic space travel with Age of Discovery aesthetics which clashes too much. While I didn't hate this film, I wasn't impressed either.",Treasure Planet
15,TheMovieDiorama,Treasure Planet almost strikes Disney gold.,7,29 March 2018,"An adaptation of Stevenson's novel 'Treasure Island' but with a plethora of sci-fi twists to freshen up the story. A childhood favourite of mine and among the more underrated Disney animations in their classic canon, it will leave you staying aboard as opposed to walking the plank. Troublemaker Jim Hawkins stumbles across a map that reveals the location of the formidable Treasure Planet, a celestial body believed to hold Flint's universal riches. Cyborg John Silver hears news of the map and, with the help of his crew, lead a mutiny to obtain the gold for himself. Reinterpretations of classic stories are always interesting, particularly when the links between them are conveyed with clarity. Hawkins, Silver, B.E.N, Bones and the planet itself all resemble key plot points of the novel, yet are reinvented to create a fresh plot that introduces the famous story to a new generation. For the most part, it works extremely well. As with any Disney classic, it's filled with imaginative visuals that will delight the eyes as they glance into the depths of outer space, witnessing supernovas, black holes and an insectoid who commits murder. Maybe scrap the last point, but it remains visually interesting throughout the short runtime. The pacing is extremely rapid as if skysurfing across the glistening stars. The character designs relished in anthropomorphism, from your average cat and dog to a floating blob that can morph into any form. Consistently retaining a sense of innovation and memorability. Voice casting was good particularly Gordon-Levitt, Thompson and Murray who inject astronomical life into their characters. The final act was notably gripping and who doesn't love a tense countdown to total obliteration! The characterisation was slightly on the thin side, particularly the bond between Hawkins and Silver, which does make certain characters unmemorable (seriously, no one remembers Delbert Doppler...). The overuse of 2D hand drawn animation atop 3D CGI felt gimmicky. However, the film retains its position as one of my favourites.",Treasure Planet
16,RosanaBotafogo,Otherwise regular...,7,3 July 2021,"Lightly based on Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"", but in a futuristic future (pleonasm) fun, cute, a version if not creative, satisfying, cute, with captivating characters, Dr. Delbert Doppler, with the best cuties , otherwise regular...",Treasure Planet
17,Vartiainen,Beautiful fusion of CGI and hand-drawn animation,7,4 January 2016,"Disney has always been at its best when adapting existing stories and characters. So in that regard this film was almost like a match made in heaven. Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure novel is full of pirates, excitement, exotic locations, humongous characters and personalities. Everything that Disney does so well.And for the most part they succeed here as well. The story from the novel is adapted without any major hitches and the characters are very likable. Brian Murray as Long John Silver is terrific in his role and is easily the character you want to see the most. Emma Thompson and Roscoe Lee Browne are a lot of fun as the ship's captain and her impeccably mannered first mate. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jim Hawkins is a bit of a hit and miss for me, but not by much. I think they were going for a younger Aladdin, but overshot the ""I'm a rebel"" factor.The film also looks amazing. All the ships and most of the backgrounds are done with CGI, but they went with such stylistic designs, which are not even supposed to look realistic, that they have aged barely at all. The character designs are also inventive, especially Silver's new and improved cyborg arm and leg. The score is not bad, though perhaps a touch too modern and pop for it to be truly classic.Where the film does stumble slightly is the story. Nothing major is changed, and the original is one of the best ever written, but the film suffers from the same problem Atlantis: The Lost Empire did. Namely that there are so many events to cover that the normal Disney running time simply does not cut it. This needed to be about half an hour longer for it to flow properly. Now more than one scene feels rushed and they fail to capture the emotions and the themes behind the buccaneering and hunting for lost gold.It's a fun film and definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of Disney or adventures in general. It doesn't quite have that edge of Renaissance films, but it's still definitely one of the better animated films of this millennium.",Treasure Planet
18,lisafordeay,The last time I seen this movie was over 11 years ago as a kid at the cinemas,7,6 August 2013,"Treasure Planet is based off the Robert Louis Stevenson Novel Treasure Island except this time its set in some distant futuristic world where a rebellious teenager named Jim Hawkins(voiced by Joseph Gordon Levitt from 500 Days Of Summer), who lives with his mom who works in a mill that got burnt to the ground because some baddies were after something that Jim receives which is an unusual looking golden ball that carries the map that will uncover some valuable treasure. He teams up with a cyborg named John Silver(voiced by Brian Murray),a pink creature that body shifts into anything he wants,and a very irritating robot named B.E.N (voiced by Father Of The Bride's Martin Short). Together they embark on a whirlwind adventure with a Feline-Like human named Captain Amelia( voiced by Emma Thompson,who as you may know and this is some trivia now voiced Queen Eleanor in the Disney/Pixar movie Brave).SO after 11 years of an absence you want me to tell ya what I think of this movie? Well firstly I have to say that I loved the song I'm Not Here(Jim's Theme) by the Goo Goo Dolls front man John Rzerbeck. Its got great lyrics and the song goes well with the film. The animation is gorgeous looking and awesome,especially the effects that went into the making of this movie. The story was pretty good,its not the best Disney movie in the world but you gotta love the futuristic world in the film.Overall I was glad to grab a copy of this last week at my local DVD store at a very good price and its definitely worth a look.If you love Pirates Of The Caribbean(cause of all the weird looking creatures in it) then this is for you.From the creators of Hercules and The Little Mermaid,Treasure Planet gets a 7 out of 10 from me.",Treasure Planet
19,ackstasis,"""There were nights when the winds of the Etherium, so inviting in their promise of flight and freedom, made one's spirit soar.""",7,22 November 2007,"It's an oft-repeated sentiment that Pixar Studios is the only company releasing animation feature-films that are worth seeing. While it would be foolish to deny that Pixar largely represents the finest output that modern American animation has to offer, it'd be a pity to overlook such minor gems as 'Treasure Planet (2002),' the 42nd feature-film in Disney's official canon. The film is a futuristic/fantastical retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic 1883 adventure novel, ""Treasure Island,"" with which I am not as familiar as I probably should be {I've read his ""Kidnapped,"" ""Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and a few of his other short stories and novellas, but strangely I cannot recall anything regarding the adventures of Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver}. Stevenson's swashbuckling tale of pirates and treasure has been relocated to the depths of space, where huge space-ships (built in the style of traditional 19th century sea vessels) drift among planets, stars and galaxies via interstellar atmospheric currents called the Etherium winds.Jim Hawkins (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has always been fascinated by the tales of Captain Nathaniel Flint and of Treasure Planet, containing the loot of a thousand worlds. Now a young man, Jim possesses a thirst for adventure, and a willingness to prove himself, though his escapades have caused him trouble with the law. After a dying traveller bequeaths to him a metal sphere, a holographic map providing directions to Treasure Planet, young Jim and a bumbling, astronomy professor, Dr. Delbert Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) strike off in pursuit of the riches. The ship that will take them to the legendary planet is captained by the cat-like Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson), whilst the suspicious cyborg cook, John Silver (Brian Murray), plots a mutinous scheme that can only end in trouble. In place of Silver's pet parrot is a lovable little shape-shifting creature called Morph (Dane A. Davis), and we also meet a loud and clumsy robot named B.E.N. (Martin Short).I've got a soft spot for most works of science-fiction, and so it's probably no surprise that I found a lot to like in 'Treasure Planet.' I thought the filmmakers did a great job of taking a story about pirates and treasure and placing it in a futuristic setting, whilst still maintaining the swashbuckling sense of adventure. The traditional animation, blended with some 3D computer-generated backgrounds and such, looked positively gorgeous, the quiet depths of deep space given a serene, almost heavenly, quality. The voice acting was also pretty good, even if the jokes were sometimes a bit juvenile for my tastes, and David Hyde Pierce gets all the best lines! Perhaps the greatest achievement of this film is that it might just entice viewers to seek out Stevenson's original novel, whether it be for the first time or to rediscover its magic. I know that, for my part, I've just added a new entry to my list of books to read.",Treasure Planet
20,CubsandCulture,I am so glad I re-watched this...it is wonderful,10,9 December 2020,"I had a very negative reaction to this film when it first came out, thinking that transporting Treasure Island into space was as silly as turning Dangerous Liaisons into a teen melodrama, ala Cruel Intentions. I recently reread the novel and decided to watch a few cinematic treatments of the story. This one ended up standing out from other versions. It is remarkable how close the final film is to the spirit of the novel while scrambling the plot, characters. It is just as an exciting piece of visual entertainment as the novel is of prose. A lot of the choices the script makes-beefing up Silver as a father figure-really land with this setting.The science fantasy, or scientific romance, elements are all really well done and the visual grandeur is among the most impressive in the Disney canon; the characters, art direction are all memorably alien while being British c. 1750 flavored. Moreover, the change in setting really captures the spirit of exploration and discovery that more literal, period adaptation miss.Top it all off with David Hyde Pierce at his comedic best, Gordon-Levitt at his most soulful, Brain Murray being utterly charming, sinister the voice work is much better than I remember it being.",Treasure Planet
21,Fluke_Skywalker,'Treasure' remains buried,6,12 June 2014,"Take a classic tale--say, one that's in the public domain--Transport it to a sci-fi setting, slap on a couple of radio-ready pop songs and 'Pow!', you've got a hit... Only 'Treasure Planet' wasn't a hit. Now I know why.Personally speaking, I've never been much of a Disney fan. I don't care for their movies, not a big fan of their iconic characters. The whole Disneyana thing just doesn't do anything for me. In fact, this might only be the second or third Disney animated feature I've ever watched start to finish. But I thought I might enjoy this one. It has a male protagonist, which is rare for a Disney animated feature, it's an adventure story and it has a sci-fi twist. But everything here is thin as a gold doubloon. The characterizations, the animation, the voice acting. It's all a shrug. The whole thing feels like a direct to video feature.Kids are likely to be bored witless by 'Treasure Planet', and fans of 'Treasure Island' would be better served by re-reading the book instead.",Treasure Planet
22,r96sk,I love every single detail about this film,10,21 July 2020,"Unequivocally, unmistakably, undeniably Disney's greatest animated film. A masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned. Long read ahead!Film and reviews are all about opinions, which is only a positive thing. I, for one, though have yet to find a better animation than this. No doubt I'm probably partly clouded by nostalgia, but even a tonne of years later I still remember how blown away I was when I first watched it. Nothing's changed.Where to start? I love every single detail about this film, for which there are many. Not only does it improve upon the studio's earlier 1950 production about Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel, but it manages to create an incredibly touching, amusing and rather thrilling story for all. They don't rely on the usual, overdone Disney front and center romance to do it either.It's a story of a young kid coming-of-age into the world. You really go on a journey with Jim Hawkins, who hadn't had the most happiest childhood. We see him grow into a man across just 95 short minutes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings Jim to life superbly, no surprise to see he has done other great things in his career.Gordon-Levitt isn't the only outstanding performer here, with Brian Murray and Emma Thompson showing their talents in the roles of John Silver and Capt. Amelia. I adore the dynamic between Silver and Hawkins, Murray is truly brilliant. Thompson is great in her role, also.Even below those aforementioned names, you have memorable characters in Delbert (David Hyde Pierce), B.E.N. (Martin Short) and Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne). Morph (Dane Davis) is a cracking little sidekick, too.Away from the cast, you also have the sensational animation. They mix hand-drawn 2D and computer generated 3D, which comes out exquisitely. Sure some of it hasn't aged impeccably compared to now, but it all to this day still looks utterly stunning. I love the attention to detail.That's not all. How about that music? I couldn't tell you the amount of times I've listened to that soundtrack down the years, it's so beautifully crafted by James Newton Howard and John Rzeznik; the latter's, as part of the Goo Goo Dolls, ""I'm Still Here"" fits so, so well.Can you tell how much fondness I hold for this? It's fantastic! Did Disney mishandle it? Sure. Does it deserves more respect? Definitely. However, I'm kinda glad they just let Ron Clements and John Musker do their thing. Heavy Disney interference could've ruined it. The fact this has zero pointless sequels is marvellous, even if it's for the wrong reasons.There are minor rumours they plan to live-action this. Normally I'd argue against classics being remade, but I think this 2002 production is in a win-win position in that regard. If it's a big success it'll be good for it, if it's terrible then it'll put more eyes on the original.It's kinda funny, I don't see myself as a Disney fan and yet my two favourites films (this + 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl') are from this studio - and both pirate-y, interestingly. Hmm.Go watch 'Treasure Planet'!",Treasure Planet
23,MissSimonetta,Probably THE Disney cult film,6,16 June 2020,"TREASURE PLANET is more often than not counted among Disney's underrated titles and in the years since its initial flop in 2002, it's become a cult film. I can see the appeal-- the aesthetics are cool and the animation is great-- though honestly, every time I rewatch this one so much of it feels rushed, particularly the growth of the bond between Jim and Silver, which is the heart of the story. Still, it's an enjoyable movie and deserved better than it got 18 years ago.",Treasure Planet
24,NateWatchesCoolMovies,One of Disney's very best,10,8 August 2015,"Disney's Treasure Planet is one of the most underrated films to ever be put out by the studio. It has imagination in spades, a quirky, eclectic cast of voice actors, a palpable sense of meaning thanks to the fantastic adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, and a galactic gallery of insanely creative cosmic visuals that are breathtaking. This is seriously the most beautiful looking Disney film I've seen. Rich detailed work blends the old fashioned wood style of the 1700's with a robotic, steam punk esque sensibility that blows the mind. As a result we get sky pirate ships that navigate maroon crested waves of the sea of stars, a wonderfully lively cyborg Long John Silver (Brian Murray POWER), a wicked sky surfing sequence complete with hover boat cops, a gorgeous exotic forest worlds away, and grotesque, gnarly aliens with lilting pirate brogues. The melding of the two styles is uncannily successful. Joseph Gordon Levitt lays young Jim Hawkins wonderfully, with a sense of roguish style and thirst for adventure that brings the character to life. Cantankerous Patrick Mcgoohan briefly voices a reptilian Billy Bones to great effect. The neurotic, jumpy Martin Short voices, you guessed it, a neurotic and jumpy Robot version of the castaway Ben. Michael Wincott lends his cement speckled rasp to Scroop, a deliciously evil spider pirate villain. Why this flick didn't get the rapturous acclaim of stuff like Frozen or Tangled is beyond me. It's got loads of committed imagination, and reinvents a timeless tale for a futuristic twist that isn't gimmicky, and doesn't try too hard. It pays detailed attention to every little creation. The little ball of pink flubbed named Morph is a winner. The way the sails of the sky pirate vessels are honeycombed with electronic solar panels is inspired. These a few of the countless creations found in this movie. That sense of style melded with the mature, grounded way they treat the characters makes for a big winner.",Treasure Planet
25,davispittman,The most underrated Disney film,8,23 November 2015,"Treasure Planet is so underrated and I honestly cannot believe it because it's so entertaining and fun for the entire family to sit down and watch! The lines of dialogue between characters here is so intelligent and funny. The special effects and the animation is wonderfully made. The voice actors were cast very well too, especially Emma Thompson, she did especially well! This movie's plot is well constructed and well executed. I was thoroughly impressed with this 2002 Disney film, and I truly believe you will be impressed as well. Treasure Planet is one of my favorite animated movies, it has some very heart warming and touching moments too. 8/10 for Disney's Treasure Planet (2002)",Treasure Planet
26,Enchorde,Get ready for an adventure,6,1 March 2004,"The evening is getting dark, there is nothing to do and you feel like an adventure? Then this might be the movie for you. Now, this being a family animated movie, does not give the great suspense, action or thrill a grown up watcher seeks. But, nonetheless, this is a good movie. The animations are very good, giving a good feeling and presenting wonderful scenery. The characters are a good match for this kind of movie, and altogether they create the great strength of this movie; the feeling, the atmosphere. I could really feel this no-worries exploring adventuring that the characters took for granted, and it made up for a lot of things the movie otherwise lacked.So if you don't really need the suspense, but could enjoy a nice saga, this is good. But I would be really curious about a grown-up version...6/10",Treasure Planet

Sure, you can quarrel about the whole concept of the film's space travel and gravity and blah, blah, blah, who cares. This movie was inventive and fun to watch, and its plot shortcomings were minor aberations. Its unfortunate that few people actually watched this film, but that's what you get when you release against four other movies.

29,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Such an exciting ride....,10,21 May 2013,"It's rare that Disney reboots or remakes any of its previous films. With the minds that they have working for them, there really is no need. But every now and then the mouse house will do it because either there is a fan-base demand or just because. Treasure Planet (2002) is a remake of the Disney's classic, Treasure Island (1950) and it is done with brilliance in so many areas.The plot is the same as Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel; the difference is how it's portrayed. It is the whole reason why the title is called Treasure Planet in the first place. Instead of taking place in modern daytime, it takes place in a futuristic time. Pretty sweet. The entire way this particular universe was constructed was done so well it oozes imagination. Strange as it is though, that for a setting so upgraded, that the vehicle individuals travel in are ships. It seems so primitive but it still fits the story well.The characters used in this story all have the same names but their illustrations are much more unnatural...in a good way of course. Jim Hawkins and his mother are the only two who look like humans. All the other characters are humanoid like species. For example, Doctor Doppler resembles a dog, while Captain Amelia resembles a cat. However the one character I can't put my finger on is John Silver. I don't know what animal he looks like, but he does resemble actor Louis Wolheim a little too much, not to mention his speaking pattern. BEN is also a funny character since he's absent-minded and all. Nevertheless, each voice actor puts in his or her best performance; it's partially what gives the movie its charm.The other component that gives this movie so much emotion is James Newton Howard's musical score. For each scene, he provides the best tone, more specifically when Jim and Silver were on screen. What helps makes those scenes important and memorable was that flute in the back repeating the theme to the movie itself. It gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. Which also brings up another point about Jim and Silver's character development. The relationship that these individuals create is really heartwarming and brings up a good point that every son needs a father figure in their life. Last but not least, what makes the icing on the cake for this movie were the special effects. Disney invested a lot into this movie. Apparently they used 2D drawings, infused with live props and 3D computer generated images. That sounds tough but it was done professionally and it looks great. My favorite special effect was Mr. Silver's robotic arm. Absolutely one of the most iconic and amazing gizmos in that whole film. His arm is practically an enlarged Swiss-army knife. What I wouldn't give for that!Disney's sci-fi remake of the 1950 classic has a great voice cast, astounding effects and emotional music. Another great masterpiece from the mouse house.",Treasure Planet
30,bkrauser-81-311064,"Not Bad, But No Great",7,26 June 2016,"Treasure Planet (2002) was one of those turn of the century hand drawn Disney movies that were released just after the computer animated boom. Along with Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) and Brother Bear (2003), Treasure Planet was one of the nails in the coffin of traditional animation due to its poor box-office returns. Now does that mean that the movie is bad? No, but its not great either.The story begins with young Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as a boy reading the legend of Captain Flint and his infamous band of pirates. Years later the boy turns into a rebellious young trouble maker desperate for adventure. How can you tell he's rebellious? He has a rat tail in the future! After coming across a map to the legendary treasure planet, he and a family friend commission a ship from Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) and her first mate Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne). Things however aren't what they seem aboard the ship as the crew led by John Silver (Brian Murray) are actually pirates in hiding.Like a massive man-o-war in a modern harbor, the film is impressive to look at but listless and mostly for show. The visuals are the only thing that gets the star treatment while the script itself is lacking anything that isn't dated Disney fair or clunky exposition. There also seems to be a problem with general writing mechanics. When Jim tells his mother that he wants to go on his grand adventure she doesn't seem that adamantly against it. When the Dr. Doppler character (David Hyde Pierce) seems distracted by Captain Amelia we get nothing to show a growing romantic relationship. When the film should emotionally invest in the characters of Jim and Silver, we instead get montage. In other words this movie has a hard time getting from point A to point B.Still It's not like Treasure Planet was a failure of epic proportions. Say what you will about Disney, if this is the worst it can get than I'm actually impressed.",Treasure Planet
31,Lady_Targaryen,"Not the best of Disney,but good.",7,13 November 2005,"Treasure Planet is a good movie, but not the best of Disney. I grow up watching great Disney movies like Alladim, The Little Mermaid,The Beauty and the Beast,Pocahontas,Toy Story, Sleepy Beauty and Cinderella among others,and Treasure Planet is a little disappointing,not only because of the predictable plot but also because of the characters and the way the story is developed. I don't dare to say that a Disney movie is awful because all of them has some magic or positive message, but looks that Disney is losing it's touch.( With some exceptions like Mulan,Tarzan,Dinosaur and Brother Bear for example). A interesting thing to notice in this film are some similarities of Sarah Hawkins with Ariel and Jim Hawkins with Alladin.(since they have the same director)",Treasure Planet

34,emasterslake,It was cool for a Sci-Fi version of Treasure Island,8,15 March 2006,"I saw this in theaters back in Late 2002.Treasure Planet is inspired by the famous book, Treasure Island. Only this version is taken place in another universe where ships sail in space and Aliens and Human live in the same community.Jim Hawkin a guy who's about 17, lives with his mom who works at their Inn which is their home. Jim never got to spend much time with his dad since his dad came and go due to whatever job he's in. Jim hasn't made his mom proud for him, specially when he keeps trespassing factories on his Sail Board and getting caught by the police. His mom doesn't want to see her own son sent away to a juvenile hall.Life seems bad for Jim, till one day a pirate came out of nowhere telling Jim to take an object that a crew of pirates are after. The orb Jim got is a map that shows you the location of Treasure Planet. A tale Jim heard from as a kid is no longer a bedtime story to him. It actual exists and he's determine to go there and be sure he'll make his mom proud for him.I don't care if many people disliked this movie. But I really enjoyed it. Even if it's one of the PG rated Animated Disney movies.The CGI and 2-D animation combined together makes it very visual. It's rated PG only for Action violence, and a few non important characters die. It also has a would be villain and an actual villain in it too.I recommend it to those who like sci-Fi animated films or those who are into the unique Disney movies. It's something the whole family can enjoy together.",Treasure Planet
35,ProjectAnomaly,Treasure Planet,7,1 October 2019,The animation in this movie truly is a treasure. I'm just going to leave now.,Treasure Planet
36,sharky_55,"On the clearest of nights, when the winds of the Etherium were calm...",7,14 July 2016,"The very first scene of Treasure Planet establishes its objective to break free of the traditional roots of Robert Louis Stevenson's adventure novel; the young Jim Hawkins' book does not contain words, but moving, flashing pictures which allow for complete and utter immersion. His gigantic head pops up in the midst of a great big cargo ship being pursued, not through the seas, but the spies above us. The film's take is modernised, and aligns with this objective; traditional animation still etches out most of the human characters, but there are additional three dimensional renders which are shown off to their fullest by the proud animators. The most stunning of these is the reveal of the living breathing port town on the moon; we don't simply jump right into the action, but zoom in from afar and swivel around via their Deep Canvas technique so that each facet of the environment and the digital render is on display. The setting of the adventure story is a vague anachronistic future where civilisation has taken to the stars and galaxies above but still shoot through space in wooden ships with sails. Jim's mother owns an inn which serves weird patrons of all sizes and species with weirder foods. The society is also advanced enough to delegate its policing to robots, who rough up Jim and give him one last warning. Another robotic character that we meet later is B.E.N, who is voiced by a comedian and exists only to make the odd one-liner and dole out crucial plot details whenever necessary. It seems that every animated film must have one of these wacky, obnoxious sidekicks. B.E.N is rendered digitally in 3D so at least all his crazy antics are captured vividly. The rest of the cast is established in varying amounts of detail but it lacks the charm and personality of Disney's earlier film, Atlantis, which produced stereotypes but also gave heart and agency to its motley crew. One of the crew is a pirate in disguise, John Silver (as if the name did not ring any bells), who develops a soft spot for Jim and slowly becomes a proxy father figure. A pleasant surprise sees their relationship built from the genuine reactions and experiences of the two characters; Silver is able to diagnose the source of Jim's feistyness and impulsiveness because perhaps he sees the same qualities in a younger version of himself, bouncing from pirate ship to ship. The theme of missing parenthood is a common one in many children's films, but it does not feel forced here, but rather a natural extension of their stories and actions. Was Treasure Planet one of the coming signs of the death of traditional animation and the boom of digital? The film was a box office bomb, and in the coming years the shift was inevitable. Paradoxically, much of the digital elements now seem retrograde and dated; B.E.N could have done just as well drawn by hand, and although the sight of massive waves of individually rendered gold pieces and treasure is an impressive feat, it looks overly shiny and fake. But that aging comes with any technology. Treasure Planet cannot escape from the worst of these animation films; the pop song over spirited montage, the unavoidable blossoming romance, the crass flatulence humour. There is a better film hiding within its premised, and in the magical folds of Jim's storybook.",Treasure Planet
37,vip_ebriega,A buried 'Treasure'.,7,16 July 2008,"My Take: Not superior to many of Disney's adventures, it nonetheless carries that grand formula. Long gone are the days of ALADDIN and THE LION KING for the folks at Disney... but lets not drop it there. There's much pleasure in Disney's 2002 effort TREASURE PLANET than anyone has given it credit for. Despite its disappointing box-office performance, there's actually a lot going for in this non-musical but adventurous Disney effort, blending an old-fashioned pirate adventure with a boyish space adventure. While it usually betrays its print source (the classic pirate adventure by Robert Louis Stevenson), but it doesn't so with the audience, young and old, who will sure have a swell time.The movie keeps its faith in the original story, about young local boy Jim Hawkins (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) getting his hands on a map which whisks him in a quest of peril and mutiny to find it. But the movie ties it up with some neat, while unnecessary, twists. Like the map, which now isn't painted on a piece of parchment, now it's something that resembles a spherical object which you twist around like a Rubix cube in able to operate it. There's also the new look on the villain, Long John Silver. Before, he was a peg-legged pirate with a talking parrot. Now, he's a cyborg (voiced by Brian Murray) accompanied by a gelatinous morphing creature which doesn't copy the voices it hears like a parrot, it literally takes its complete form.But despite its differences, TREASURE PLANET doesn't deny the sense of fun, which is the Disney trait. While the addition of whimsical musical numbers are surely out, TREASURE PLANET still has its sense of pure adventure, one that whisks the audience in a series of impressive imaginings (as the wonderful animations are once again the stars). So little lack of the trademark Disney delight is more than enough to overlook.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Treasure Planet
38,phubbs,Treasure Planet,6,6 January 2014,"Avast ye scurvy space lubbers!. I just recently watched this on Bluray (1080p), holy coconuts it looks good! and bare in mind this film is twelve years old now. I recall when this was released and boy was it destroyed by the critics, really panned, but I can't understand why, this is only the second time I've seen this since the cinema and I loved it. The idea of sticking this classic 18th Century set adventure into the sci-fi realm is actually a sweet one, I'm surprised it has not happened before. The whole concept really does fit the space adventurer aspect nicely but of course there are some bits n pieces that don't add up. Like why on earth would all spacecraft in the far distant unknown future be built around centuries old galleon designs by humankind? and are those ships actually made of wood??!!. Why would these ships require sails? and how come no one (mainly humans) dies from exposure to deep space? there isn't anything to protect anyone accept a gravity force field. Kinda odd seeing a young 'Hawkins' high up on the ships rope ladders with the space winds blowing through his hair.Are all buildings in this future made of wood?! can there be that much wood left? why are various alien species wearing centuries old human attire? all aliens speak the human language of English? are they actually using rope on these ships!!? ROPE! and there doesn't appear to be many humans left now I think of it...just Hawkins and his mum or so it seems. I could go on but at some point you gotta let it go, its Treasure Island in space with aliens and robots, its just suppose to be visual fun and it is by gum!.Silly absurd nonsensical plot issues aside the whole aged steampunk/historic aesthetic look is really pleasing to the eye. Some of the space sequences really do look gorgeous, a cosmic ballet indeed. Of course the film is dated which means dated CGI is evident throughout, some obvious and some not so. Its nothing too horrendous and is tolerable. Some of the best looking CGI is easily the crescent moon shaped spaceport which borders suspiciously on Mos Eisley. Where as some of the worst CGI would be the huge whale-like space creatures and the rather over the top finale on treasure planet.The characters are a fair bunch and fairly enjoyable to watch. Old 'Long John' has been crafted into a half alien half Terminator style cyborg which is curious. Sounds stupid but it actually plays out OK and looks pretty good. Jim is your standard rebellious scruff of a boy who also strangely looks familiar to 'John Connor' from 'T2', I think there is some definite influence there. The rest of the crew are satisfactory but nothing amazing, obligatory insectoid type guy, 'Star Wars Cantina' type alien, floating blob, Cat-like female, one eyed alien etc...bog standard alien designs really, possible homages I guess.I must confess to not liking Martin Short's characterisation of robot B.E.N. with his insanely loud grating voice. The way this character is portrayed as a robot gone mad is just annoying and kinda old. The kind of role you'd give to Robin Williams and his annoying crazy loudness. The only voice I did like was Murray's Irish take on Long John which does give that nice olde worlde touch, you get a good sense of the character with this, a good sense of history.There are tonnes of problems with this film that just don't add up at all, the idea of a space set pirate film works but also doesn't. I do think they just abandoned a lot of sense simply because its an animated Disney movie for kids and it simply wouldn't matter. True it doesn't matter, it is just an enjoyable fantasy romp for kids, but at the same time it would have been nice to address some of the silliness. After all everyone of all ages will watch it and while it does look awesome with some lovely creativity and imagination, the silliness sticks out like a giraffe at a polar bears only club.6.5/10",Treasure Planet

41,Animany94,Most underrated Disney movie!,9,31 July 2017,"I thoroughly enjoyed Treasure Planet! It has likable characters, great animation, a good pacing and amazing voice actors. My favorite voices in this movie are John Silver (Brian Murray), Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson), Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Brown) and Scroop (Michael Wincott). But the absolute best thing about this film is the relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver. Jim gets the father figure he lacks, because his dad apparently left him. Speaking of his dad, the flashback during the song ""I'm Still Here"" makes me cry almost every time. But Silver cares for Jim, but is still a pirate who wants his treasure. That interaction between Jim and Silver is just great! Scroop is actually a more scary character than the leader of the pirates himself!Of course there are some of those comedic characters that can seem either out of place or annoying. Personally, I find Morph entertaining, because he is a quite clever take on a futuristic parrot, not mimicking other people's voices, but transforming into other people. B.E.N. on the other hand can be REALLY annoying, but he is not a pointless comedic character without a role in the overall plot. The fart joke kind of pirate had me smiling a little, but is rather pointless. There are also some things about the setting which are never answered. Like how they breath in space, but I can live with that. After all, it is a fantasy film.Really underrated movie which despite its flaws and unanswered questions about the setting.

Jim and his friend Dr. Doppler go out to find the treasure, along with a suspicious crew...Here are the five main reasons I love this film and why it is special to me.One: The animation is beautifully done, a mix between cartoon and computer animation. Two: The characters are excellent, except for Mr. Scroop, I don't really like the way he looks. My favourite characters are B.E.N, Dr. Doppler and Captain Amelia. Three: The storyline is well-done and exciting. I like the plot very much too. Four: The voices picked for B.E.N. (Martin Short), Dr. Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) and Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) are very good voices. Five: There's a good song in the middle of this film called ""I'm Still Here"". I like to sing along to it when it comes up and ""The Goo Goo Dolls"" sing it well.So, if you haven't seen it, DO! HIGHLY Recommended! :) ;) :()",Treasure Planet
47,ersinkdotcom,"""Treasure Planet"" takes R.L. Stevenson's classic pirate's tale into space",8,7 July 2012,"Leave it to Disney to come up with a way to update Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale ""Treasure Island"" into a science fiction epic. The studio that brought you the unforgettable live-action film version returned to the source material once again with the idea of taking the adventure into deep space and to other worlds. Unfortunately, moviegoers weren't interested in ""Treasure Planet"" when it came out in 2002. The film underperformed at the box office but was still nominated for a 2002 Academy Award in the category of Best Animated Feature.Thanks to every movie on the planet receiving the high definition treatment, audiences get the chance to give this entertaining film another chance with the release of ""Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition."" It's hard to believe the movie came out 10 years ago. It was the first to be released in IMAX and regular theaters on the same day. The movie is also of importance as a shining example of 2D hand drawn art used on top of 3D computer animation.Not much changes in ""Treasure Planet"" as far as story and characters go. It still revolves around Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who discovers a holographic treasure map that supposedly leads to a pirate's loot on a far-off planet. Hawkins and his mentor Dr. Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) embark on a trek across the stars on a ship whose crew is made up of dangerous aliens led by a mutineering cyborg named Long John Silver (Brian Murray). Can Jim and the rest of the loyal crew of the ship find the treasure and collect it before the traitorous buccaneers do?This will relate to fans of sci-fi both young and old. It takes the great classic tale and successfully makes it relevant to kids in the 21st century used to watching ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and other movies and TV shows that take them to other worlds. The pacing of the film is good and the story will keep the viewer's attention.""Treasure Planet"" is an excellent example of how hand drawn and computer animation can co-exist. The story is complex enough for adults yet simple enough for children to take in. It's a great film recommended for Disney and sci-fi fans alike.",Treasure Planet

This science-fiction version of the classic ""Treasure Island"" is an imperfect but interesting concept.  Disney's penchant for cutting-edge animation shows with this feature.  Not enough credit was given for the task of combining hand-drawn and computer animation.  This mixture makes a wonderful combination, best seen in the character of John Silver.  Some good performances are heard in Emma Thompson's stoic Captain Amelia and Martin Short's frenetic robot B.E.N.

Treasure Planet, a Disney film which I've decided to re-visit after many years of forgottens.

The awesome futuristic steam punk-esthetic, the remarkable story, the awesome characters, their relationship and dialogues all results in an epic voyage with a legendary saga of the legacy; Treasure Island.They really succeeded with the overall setting and the feel it accumulates, the whole story and the legacy is so grand and renownedly framed I can perceive the universe they experience in my soul.",Treasure Planet
56,bix171,Disney's Continued Evolution,10,27 November 2002,"As Disney animation evolves in its transition from films for all ages to targeting older children and new teenagers (`Dinosaur', `Atlantis: The Lost Empire', `Lilo & Stitch'), they continue to deal with the fickleness of that market, one that has a shorter attention span than ever and tastes that encompass more vicarious forms of entertainment. `Treasure Planet' is an attempt to meet that audience while updating source material that might have a more universal appeal. It's probably the most cohesive and engrossing Disney animated feature in years, filled with awe-inspiring set pieces (altering `Treasure Island' to take place in space is a marvelous concept) and with many of the psychological insights that have made Disney films gentle but astute tutors on childhood. This time, though, the theme is more mature (the search for the father who has abandoned you and being able to let him go once you've found him), aimed at a crowd perhaps old enough to understand it explicitly. To that end, they make Jim Hawkins, the main character (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt from `3rd Rock From The Sun'), something of a delinquent (though one a danger only to himself) whose self-esteem is directly tied to his need for a father-figure. Fortunately, to keep things entertaining, there's plenty of (mostly) low humor provided by the most jovial of the current crop of Disney directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, whose introduction of slapstick into `Aladdin' via Robin Williams was perhaps the animation unit's masterstroke. This time around, comic relief is in the form of Martin Short as a wacked-out robot and Mona Marshall as Morph, the best sidekick since Iago in `Aladdin'. The other voice cast members, all appealing, include Emma Thompson as Captain Amelia and David Hyde Pierce as Dr. Doppler; but it's the gifted Brian Murray as John Silver that makes the most impact, bringing sensitivity as well as menace to a role that is exactly what the underlying text calls for. A great film. (Note: this film was seen on an IMAX screen which probably was an important consideration in my enjoyment of the film. But the dazzling clarity and depth of color in the large format cannot be overstated.)",Treasure Planet

58,robert-710-767167,Brilliant and awesome,7,24 April 2012,"I had seen this movie a long time ago around the time it came out. I was young back then so the 3d was amazing and fascinated me. Now of course I've seen plenty of 3d films so going back to cartoon only was sort of a challenge at first, but I got used to it. So it became really cool watching the 3d animations take off.The plot, despite being from what I could assume is the future, was still very interesting and was at heart. I really enjoyed the characters and their development. And the ending was very well done! The characters that fell in love weren't as good as I thought it could have been, and I'm a bit disappointed that the main guy didn't get a girl (As they all seem to) but hey, it wasn't bad anyway!So I thus rate it 7/10.",Treasure Planet
59,BadWebDiver,Good little classical update.,9,13 April 2003,"This is a not-too-bad update of the classic tale of ""Treasure Island"". Sure, it's not in the brilliant style of great Disney animated films (like BEAUTY & THE BEAST, THE LION KING, or the classics like SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, etc), but it certainly is heap better than a standard Saturday morning tv fair type or some glorified commercial like POKEMON or such like.The voice casting is outstanding, especially Emma Thompson as the alien feline ships captain. (A ship's cat - geddit?!)  Also Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Roscoe Lee Browne, David Hyde Pierce and Martin Short do add great personality to their characters.  And the opening fight scene is especially well-staged and sets up the start excellently.I would like to point out too, that despite some critical griping, the idea of sailing ships in outer space isn't totally far-fetched.  Famed sci-fi author Arthur C Clark wrote a short story about a solar yacht race called ""The Wind from the Sun"" (and anyone who saw ATTACK OF THE CLONES will be familiar with the basic concept of a solar-sailed ship.  I also remember an old Japanese live-action fantasy film (some bottom-of-the-shelf video) which used a similar concept of a space sailing ship.My basic problem with this film is that the characters are a little bit too saccarinized and schmaltzy.  Compare this to the live-action Disney version of TREASURE ISLAND (with Robert Newton), and the Ted Turner produced version starring Charlton Heston and Christian Bale.  (You can check out my comments on this database).But minor gripes aside, this is a highly imaginative and very entertaining version of a great story.",Treasure Planet

61,mgruebel,Will get better with time,7,19 October 2015,"I was torn between a 6 and a 7 on this. The 7 because it stayed fairly faithful to the original Robert Louis Stevenson tale, while putting a lively retro-space spin on it. The 6 because years later, it has a dated 90s misunderstood-teenager-on-skateboard flavor to it, and it's waning Disney, not rising Pixar. However, I decided in the long run no one will remember the 90s part, and it will seem more like what it should be: galleons and pirates flying about in a universe filled with black holes, galaxies and crescent moon-shaped space-stations, but air everywhere.The story does not stray too far from the book. Sure, there are the usual Disneyesque touches: The slug who comes to Benbow Inn is not a drunkard. The first mate who falls overboard into the black whole is not a drunkard. Dr. Livesay does not need to warn the sailors that ""rum will be their death."" Other than the alcohol-free nature of Disney flicks, the ending is of course a bit happier. Long John Silver, rather than slinking off with a bag of gold to escape the hands of justice, is forgiven by Jim, and hands him some jewels so Jim's mom can rebuilt the burnt-down Benbow Inn. Instead of whistling ""Lillibulero,"" a pirate sings yo.... yes, THAT ride in Disneyland !Many other things are kept, with a clever twist for the most part. Ben Gunn, the marooned sailor who has hidden the treasure in his cave, becomes B.E.N., a marooned robot missing a memory chip that would reveal that the treasure is at the center of the planet down a porthole in his ""cave"" (a derelict space ship). Silver comes across as just that mix of rogue, charismatic cook, and sometimes-father figure for young Jim, just as he does in the book. The Jules Verne retro SF look is a good match for the original tale, and I think is why this movie will be regarded better by critics in the future. It has a bit of a look of 19th century oil paintings of whaling ships and industrial hardware (railroads, mills), which is great: early Disney animated films always had ""a look"" (think of how different ""Sleeping Beauty"" is from ""Snow White,"" for example), and this film definitely has a carefully crafted ""look.""One thing that had me screaming ""political correctness"" was a girl as the Captain. Blasphemy! But actually, it worked quite well. She was more of an Emma Thompson than a Farrah Fawcett, feisty, yet willing to romance a dog (she's a feline). I am not at all a fan of the token female fashionable in current action films (it denigrates women to a token), but if you have to do it, this is as close as it gets to doing it right. Still, I am so glad Peter Jackson decided to remove the ""warrior maiden"" Arwen from LOTR 2, and replace that early script by flashbacks in Aragorn's mind instead.At about 90 minutes, the story is pared to the bones, not too much time is wasted on songs (which are wonderful when they're really good, a la ""Beauty and the Beast,"" but best left out if you're not going to splurge on them). Really, no time is wasted on anything, making for a taut, well-composed script that I think will make this film rise critically with time. Of course, the raw material was one of the best kids' books of the 19th century.So for the 6-12 crowd, this film will be good fun for years to come, and its retro-SF look will age well, once the whole broody teen skateboard thing is forgotten. I look forward to seeing it again with the grandkids.",Treasure Planet
62,C22Man,Very different but entertaining take of Stevenson's classic,7,9 February 2014,"Disney decided to adapt another classic this time in the form of Stevenson's classic Treasure Island, giving it a futuristic make over in order to give us Treasure Planet. To be honest I think this is probably Disney's most underrated modern feature, it doesn't get mentioned often even though it works as a great update of the novel and as a fantastic film in its own right.The story follows rebellious teenager Jim Hawkins who discovers a map that leads across the galaxy to legendary loot of Captain Flint on Treasure Planet. Jim and Dr. Doppler gather crew to set off and find the planet. After not having a father figure, Jim bonds with the ships half- cyborg cook John Silver. But Jim's trust might be misplaced as he discovers the crew are mutinous pirates and it becomes a race against time to find the treasure. The story does a great job of updating the novel, it never strays too far from the original outline but the way it brings the futuristic aspects into play is really excellent. I really liked how well paced the story was, it moved at a nicely brisk pace but still took a lot of time out to develop these characters and that was very effective in make everything more engaging.The animation really is superb and has some of the best visuals that Disney will ever produce. The world that is created here is one of immense wonder and dream-like beauty. The Sci-Fi elements are crafted with such imagination that it's virtually impossible not to be sucked into this world. There is so much colour and life to the animation, the visuals of jet-powered ships and the glowing stars are really something to see. The idea of having a space setting is really an ingenious one and it helps to make what is a familiar story more diverse. The Steampunk element added is another wonderful idea, seeing all these futuristic aspects mixed in with pieces from the 19th century add even more magnificence to the visual tone.The characters are also very memorable. Jim is a likable lead, he is unruly but doesn't go too far down that obnoxious teen road. I like how he isn't perfect but has likable characteristics and the relationships he has are well developed, future star Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a good job voicing him too. John Silver is a great conflicted character, he's funny and witty but he has a dark side while also being very caring. He is well developed as the more he is with Jim the more unsure he becomes of what he truly wants. Doppler is an amusing character as he's clearly out of his depth which is funny and he gets some good lines though I guess he is a little annoying at times. Captain Amelia is very enjoyable, she's a fast-talker but has great determination and is voiced with energy by Emma Thompson. Martin Short voices the forgetful robot B.E.N and though he brings some good energy to the role he can also get annoying. Scroop is a very good character, his design itself is creepy and gruff voiced Michael Wincott does a great job.Another thing that stands out is the relationships. They really flesh- out certain aspects and that works well in drawing you into the story more. There does feel like a strong connection between Jim and Silver, they do seem to genuinely care about each other and Silver refuses to bring any harm to Jim. I also like how Disney took a different and more mature approach to Jim, his father wasn't killed but instead just left. That is a more interesting route for the film to take and is a smart way to explain Jim's resentments as he worries that he isn't good enough, it also makes sense for Jim to want Silver to be the father he didn't have. I also liked Jim's loving but rocky connection with his mother as well as the bond that develops between Doppler and the Captain.Elsewhere the music is very impressive. The score by James Newton Howard manages to convey sweeping adventure with some very delicate pieces. I especially like the music in the scenes with Jim and Silver as it shows perfectly the tender relations between the two. John Rzeznik provides songs, the superb 'I'm Still Here' is featured in the film and is an excellent song that fits in well. Most of the dialogue is nicely crisp and keeps that timeless speech that really fits well, avoiding the Disney trap of modernising speech. Some of the action set-pieces are also very exciting and well done. Where there issues? There are some minor ones. There are times when the jokes are a bit too deliberately immature or the scene is just a bit too silly, it can just take you out of the story a little bit. As noted some of the characters can get a little annoying. Also I don't think some of the CG sets that well among the traditional techniques at certain points.Overall though Treasure Planet is an extremely enjoyable adventure and is arguably Disney's best 2D feature since the Renaissance days. As said the visuals are among some of the best Disney has put to screen and such an interesting world is created. The characters are mostly very engaging, the storyline sticks to the novels basis well enough and I found myself actually caring about the connection that was built up between Jim and Silver. The music was also very good and the action scenes were a lot of fun. Treasure Planet still remains somewhat underrated and actually has a great deal to enjoy.",Treasure Planet
63,TheMovieDoctorful,"Tragically Underrated Disney Film, One Of Their Best",10,17 August 2016,"Until the release of ""Frozen"", ""Treasure Planet"" may have been the most over marketed Disney film of all time upon release. Back in 2002, it was EVERYWHERE. TV Spots for it were played almost religiously, ""Treasure Planet"" action figures and games were constantly being advertised between commercials on pretty much every kids entertainment channel and various fast food restaurants and cereal brands included ""Treasure Planet"" toys with their products. So obviously under-marketing was not the movie's problem...Which baffles me as the film was a massive financial flop earning only $109.6 million on a $140 million budget. So taking that into consideration, along with the fact that Disney would follow up ""Treasure Planet"" with the dismal ""The Jungle Book 2"" and the atrocious ""Home On The Range"", that MUST mean the movie was awful right? WRONG. Not only is ""Treasure Planet"" a childhood favorite, but is hands down one of the best, most emotional, most exciting and most investing Disney movies of all time. It's the most underrated without question.The visuals shown in the movie are unforgettable. Director Ron Clements and his production team have created a gorgeous, expansive and diverse universe; the planets, the aliens, the technology, the architecture, the weaponry. The world of ""Treasure Planet"" is one I was disappointed to leave by the end of its 95 minute run-time. The imagination behind the world building is ""Star Wars"" like in its scale.The film is also extremely well paced. From beginning to end, there was not a single moment where I was bored, expertly balancing character scenes, action sequences and comedic moments. It's almost to the point where I'm genuinely frustrated when the film ends as I was just having so much fun. On top of that, ""Treasure Planet"" is a film that's not afraid to put its character's through down-right traumatizing danger. Make no mistake about it, whether characters getting torn apart in black holes or melted in volcanic, planetary destructions, ""Treasure Planet"" can be extremely dark in its tone. Fortunately, ""Treasure Planet"" has the deep, investing characters to back up its gorgeous visuals. Jim Hawkins is extremely relatable and likable, a born rebel who just wants to make his loved ones proud of him. On the surface, his desire to find Flint's trove seems to be motivated by casual greed, but this is little more than a mask for his true motivation; to prove to his mother, his paternal figure John Silver and most importantly to himself that he can be somebody. Underneath his angsty exterior is a very emotionally vulnerable and broken person finally given a spark of hope by fate, and the movie has us consistently rooting for him to succeed. John Silver is very much a kindred spirit to Jim; he represents both the best (His compassion, determination, drive and loving nature) and worst (His anger, greed, stubbornness and impulsivity) personality traits of Hawkins, and thus works extremely well as a mentor figure. If Jim represents the youthful pursuit of one's validation and dreams, Silver represents how that passion can burn bright even into one's veteran years, strengthened by lessons learned along the way. In many ways, it is Silver's development and arc into a selfless, noble person that sparks Jim's transition into adulthood.Long before ""500 Days Of Summer"" made him a star, Joseph Gordon Levitt did a phenomenal job as Jim Hawkins. The passion and sincerity that Levitt gets out of the character has to have come from a personal place, as Hawkins inner torment and plight felt as real to me as an animated character's suffering could be. The diversity of Levitt's emotional range here is staggering, from beginning to end he is giving nothing less than 500% of his effort.As impressive as Levitt's performance is here, Brian Murray as John Silver is even better. How Murray is not consistently getting A-List work after this movie is completely beyond me. Murray can be charming, hilarious, intimidating and emotional as Silver, making the absolute most of a very complex character. The range of emotions Murray has to portray as John Silver is seemingly endless, and there isn't a single one that he doesn't nail on the head. His final scene with Jim Hawkins gets serious tears out of me to this very day.Emma Thompson is electrifying in her portrayal of Captain Amelia, and much like Levitt and Murray, delivers serious emotional range. Effective in both the film's comedic and serious scenes, Thompson displays great comedic timing and infectious charisma as the no- nonsense Captain of the RLS Legacy, and she is clearly having an absolute blast here.The lack of attention ""Treasure Planet"" gets as a Disney classic is extremely frustrating. It's not JUST an underrated film, it's not JUST a diamond in the rough, it's hands down one of the best and most mature works Disney has ever or will ever pump out. The movie has achieved somewhat of a cult status among Disney fans, but Lord knows that it deserved so much more. Definitive proof that you don't have to break box office records to make a masterpiece.",Treasure Planet
64,neenahhh,"Oh god, Disney should really make more movies like this one",10,19 April 2011,"Brilliant, heartwarming, leaves you uplifted, wonderful, fun, and most of all, inspiring. This film deserves a load more of stars than what was given to it. A 6.6? Too underrated! This deserves at least an 8! This was one of Disney's best animated films.Jim is a young boy, who dreams of adventures. He somehow obtains a map that leads to a place that's full of riches untold. He becomes a cabin boy in a space galleon and sets sail with the rest of the alien crew towards Treasure Planet. Aboard the ship, he befriends a cyborg, John Silver. Unbeknown to Jim, his friend is actually a pirate with a greedy scheme on his mind.I thought that the whole movie was original. The idea of setting the story in outer space, where everything's so advanced and changed.. That was great. It was interesting seeing Disney's partake on a world out in the galaxy. The animation helped a lot, too. It was brill. It made the whole movie fun, easy and engaging to watch.I think the reason I loved this film (and ""Atlantis: The Lost City"") so much when I was a kid until now, was because, aside from the great art and the great music, there was so much depth. The relationship between Jim and John Silver is amazing. You don't see a lot of that in animated films- particularly Disney ones. I was close to tears when watching 1-2 of their scenes together. It's that good. Or maybe that's just my own daddy issues getting the best of me.This was truly brilliant.

68,datautisticgamer-74853,Worthy of recognition as a Musker-Clements hit,8,5 July 2018,"To spend part of my final full day at home before I headed off to Vermont, I viewed a Blu-Ray copy of this movie that, as with many of my more recent reviews, was a gift from my brother. I have been anticipating a view of this for some time, and now that I have taken my chance, why do I believe this doesn't need to be so obscure?I want to begin by saying that character wise, the relationship between Jim and John Silver is one of the most fascinating, complex, and unpredictable I have ever seen in a Disney movie. I literally couldn't tell if John would end up being a villain, an anti-hero, or a minor protagonist based on everything that happened. That alone makes for a solid development of our characters, even when Silver's buddies don't have much to offer besides the goon trope. This character building almost complements the story with grace; they refrain from using expected twists or plot devices, such as what happens to Jim after Arrow's death. The ideas of the worlds are rather creative (such as the strange technology in the core of the treasure planet), while the aliens don't get as much of a boost. Sure, we do have some crazy designs and traits for some of the aliens, but I saw some really common ones like hammerhead-style eyes. The good news? The simple designs aren't for vital characters, which really helps considering it would make the movie significantly less interesting in comparison to other space movies. The music doesn't fit the scenes too well, and in fact I was confused about their use of a pop-rock number during one of Jim's flashbacks. If they kept using the orchestra for that scene and shifted the pop-rock to a montage, that would be easier to watch (even though other movies would have done that better). Very easily, though, the animation is what kills the chances of this being a bad movie. It presents the ideas of Treasure Island in space with really tense action and effects that beat out Atlantis: The Lost Empire's. The designs for the characters, backgrounds, and locations are, again, mostly original. That, I believe, is sufficient in giving it another identity than ""just another kid friendly aliens movie with humor, action, and maybe heart"".Families should be advised that the action is almost hardcore for a Disney movie, so it could induce some scares in children. Jim's relationships with Silver may raise questions, but his commitment to the Benbow Inn as well as the cuteness/coolness factor of Morph may be the primary balance. For a general audience, I would say this is worth its 90 minutes of run time for its action. For most Disney movies, I find that to be the rule, but I did end up entertained. It may not appeal to Treasure Island fans, but people who like Disney, space, or animation may approve of this film in the end.",Treasure Planet
69,mbhgkmsgg,Greatly underappreciated,8,10 November 2020,"Wow, what a journey back in time. I practically grew up watching Treasure Planet and I had nothing but fond memories of it. However, that was more than ten years ago. Ever since I got this movie I have wanted to revisit it but I've been scared that it wouldn't live up to those fond memories that I had. Turns out I had no reason to be scared.When I was quite a bit younger I couldn't get enough of the adventure in this film. I mean it's pirates in the future in flying ships. How could you not like that? Back then I didn't understand much of the message or the complexity of the main characters. Now, however, I saw the movie in a whole new light. The adventure is still fantastic and takes me straight back to being a kid. But I wasn't expecting to cry at the end of this film. That's not how I remembered it. But turns out that Treasure Planet is much deeper and much more emotional when you watch it as an adult.This film seems to be criminally underrated. I never hear anyone even mention Treasure Planet when discussing Disney films, let alone considering it as one of the better ones. This film is as good as any other Disney film. It still looks gorgeous 18 years later and has a wonderful message. I'm Still Here, the song of the main character, is just as good as any of the other Disney anthems, if not better. Indeed the entire soundtrack is spectacular. And what else can you really ask from a Disney film? Treasure Planet does all these things and it does them very well.I'm just so glad that this film lived up to all my memories. I was quite scared that I would ruin those precious childhood images. This film really is a gem in the Disney line up. Unfortunately, it seems that this is more of a hidden gem. Nonetheless, I'm grateful that I got to grow up with this film and I'm grateful that I still enjoy it as much as used to, be it in a slightly different way.",Treasure Planet
70,smashattack,Getting closer...,7,14 January 2003,"Disney has been attempting their latest genre, ""action/adventure"", and Treasure Planet is yet another of these more adult films.  So far Disney hasn't done too bad in this genre, since we are now free of sitting through annoying songs and have more time to see the actual movie.Treasure Planet is loosely based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.  However, this one takes place in a futuristic setting; the robots are replaced with small hover-craft, the large clippers and ships with unusual opened spaceships (which makes one wonder how the characters breath in space), parrots with morphing creatures, and one-legged pirates with cyborgs.It's really quite entertaining to see how Disney ""linked"" Treasure Planet to Treasure Island.  Billy Bones goes into the Admiral Benbow and gruffly states, ""Beware the cyborg!"" which gives it kind of a humorous twist.  I was pleased with the changes.Some parts are a little out of place.  Such as the colonial clothing during this futuristic galaxy.  It's strange to see a boy with a ponytail and wearing colonial clothing while gazing at a marvelous 3-D holographic map.The plot is the same as Treasure Island, which never really appealed to me until now.  It's more exciting if they are no longer seafaring men, but stargazing astronomers.  I was impressed with some newer additions to the story line in order to make the movie a little more thrilling, such as the black hole scene.Treasure Planet has great graphics, excellent animation, superb actors, and an innovated plot that is astounding.  While not the best animation of the year (that goes to Spirit:  Stallion of the Cimarron), it surely is worthwhile.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end, even the rather amusing and unexpected love that grows within the movie.One of the better characters is Morph, Long John's pet morph.  He has a quirky attitude to everything and provides the comic relief much better than B.E.N.  The robot was a little annoying, and I feel that he didn't do much to help the plot.All in all, Treasure Planet is definitely worthwhile.  It's a great sci-fi movie from Disney, based on one of the more popular classics of our time.",Treasure Planet

72,GuyCC,A Lot Of The Heart Is Overlooked In This One.,8,7 March 2004,"It's an interesting mix: Take Robert Louis Stevenson's tale set in the golden age of pirates, but transplant it into a science fiction retro-future.  A lot of the attention seems to be focused on the sci-fi elements, and the utter revisionist concept taken from the classic novel. But this has always been a tale about the characters of Jim and Silver.  The setting could be anywhere.I remember the book and the original Disney live-action film.  This is a pretty accurate re-telling, along with some subtle (and some not so) references to the tale for the parts they changed the most. Being done from the same director who put together ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"", I noticed the same styles and attitudes presented in this one, with focus on a lot of humorous and genuine emotional moments.  This is a tale about finding the greatest treasure ever to be discovered, but ultimately, the film is a tale of Silver and Jim finding redemption in themselves through each other.This is another one of Disney's ""Sci-fi"" series, (alongside ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""Atlantis""). Being the biggest mix of 2D and 3D animation ever done for a Disney film, it was handled quite well, and not distractingly so.  There were some scenes that it was obvious that nothing but CG was used, and that made for some visually off-setting moments.  Perhaps this was the testing ground to see if they were ready to make the move from 2D to 3D films (though I wished they hadn't closed down the traditional animation studios - the movie-going crowd will be losing classic animation soon, whether they know it or not).But Silver is an interesting character.  Visually, he's very charismatic, with a personality that leaves one to wonder whether they should cheer or boo the scoundrel.  Watching Jim's growth from a sullen, angst-ridden teen to a confidant young man is a nice character progression as well.  The music is good, the artwork is vibrant and wonderful, and it's a well done film.It's too bad this film didn't do better in the box office.  It's a much-stronger film than it was given credit for, and it now stands as one of the last three 2D animated films to be released by Disney.  For those who question how they breathed in space,: If you can buy a ship that can sail through space and the concept of artificial gravity.  Is is too hard to grasp the concept of an artificial atmosphere as well?  It's all about imagination, and this is going to be one of the last of its kind.  At least from Disney Studios, anyway.Recommended.",Treasure Planet
73,andrewmerritt-31652,An underrated Disney treasure,8,2 January 2019,"Treasure Planet is an animated Disney movie based off of the popular book Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Treasure Planet tells the story of Jim Hawkins, a rebellious man who dreams of adventure. But when a dying alien gives him coordinates to Treasure Planet, Jim immediately embarks on an adventure to find the legendary Treasure Planet. I have never read the book Treasure Island or seen the movie, but I have heard of it, as it has been adapted many times in films like the Goonies or Raiders of the Lost Ark, or any other adventure movie you can think of. And I like how the Disney executives decided to take a classic book and give it a futuristic taste, while still being respectful of the book. At least I hope they were because again I've never read Treasure Island. It's been a long time since I've watched Treasure Planet so for me to stumble upon this on Netflix I felt a wave of nostalgia hitting me. But when I watched it, I completely forgot about this treasure. The first twenty minutes of the movie I was hesitant as I felt the movie was trying too hard so they could impress the children audience as well as the adult audience. But after those twenty minutes are up and the journey begins I was swept away by how beautiful and emotional this was. And throughout Treasure Planet I still didn't remember watching this back in the day, but I do have to give props to the animators in creating a movie before CGI came out. I didn't think I would like any of the characters, but after a while they grew on me especially the relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver. These two characters felt real and believable as they have a father and son relationship that touches your heart and is powerful that doesn't feel overacted or forced on you. I have to give everybody making this film credit as they create an animated film that has so much soul and passion, while not taking it too seriously so that they could make an animated film for everybody to enjoy. But in the end, it ended up being a box office bomb, that even though it is a fun enjoyable movie, the producers didn't push hard enough to become the next franchise in the Disney universe. And it's a shame that the marketing team wasn't on board with this film as well that they just left it in the dust, while it could've had so much potential, instead of becoming a word of mouth movie. So overall, Treasure Planet is an underrated Disney movie that deserves to be recognized and is definitely worth exploring for the whole family.",Treasure Planet
74,brent_or,Points for Potential,6,2 May 2014,"Having recently re-watched this film for the first time, I find that as much as I am still inspired by it, I unfortunately cannot give it more than 6/10, maybe 6.5. Treasure Planet is a great concept, and does feature a number of terrific individual ideas and elements. But on the whole, it's a very rough project. So, points for potential, but only so many.Pros - The basic idea of 'Treasure Island as science fiction,' which manifests itself in several interesting ways, such as a crescent-moon- shaped spaceport and Long John Silver as a cyborg. Then there is Ben the robot, basically a more manic/eccentric version of C-3PO, who is truly entertaining. And last but not least, this film features perhaps my favorite Disney animated character ever, the feline-ish Captain Amelia, voiced by Emma Thompson.Cons - The basic character animation in Treasure Planet is really rough. I am referring to basically all aspects of it, from the designs (often clichéd and unimaginative, old Disney anachronisms) to the detail (feels unfinished as opposed to deliberately minimalistic) to the very awkward design of the lead. Jim Hawkins' face is just very odd, proportionately distracting, and what in the world is a character in a 2002 film doing with a bowl haircut?Beyond the characters, the general realization of the story beats feels a bit like Disney on autopilot. It's decent, but not nearly as imaginative and inspired as it could have been. I should also mention that the 2D/3D integration in this film is a bit incongruous. Personally, I think that such a combination works best when the 3D portion sticks to the same aesthetic as the 2D portion, but I realize that this was early in the game for such techniques. Oddly though, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, which was released a year prior to Treasure Planet, is in my opinion superior in almost every way, including the quality of the visuals.Overall, Treasure Planet is a likable film, and I love the imagination-fuel of ships literally sailing through the ""etherium"" of space. Ultimately, though, it just isn't a fully-realized film, which is sad to have to say. Of course, this is from an adult perspective. I would totally be thrilled to show this film to kids, as I imagine that it would make a great impression for the right reasons. I would love to see this remade as live-action someday. It has that sort of potential.",Treasure Planet
75,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Treasure Planet,10,16 April 2003,"The Walt Disney Company has retold classic tales many times over and over in their animated films but Treasure Planet is the first time the animation giant is retelling a classic novel in a totally different setting then in the novel. The road from idea to the big screen has not been easy for Treasure Planet. For nearly ten years, the film has been in purgatory because Jeffery Katzenberg, who was once head of the studios area of the company, thought it was better for the two directors to do more films like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin which worked then experiment with something very different. But now that Treasure Planet has been able to make it to the big screen, will Katzenberg be right that this is way too out there for audiences to accept or will the film be an overwhelming success?The story goes that Jim Hawkins lives his single mother helping run the Benbow Inn. Helping is not quite the word since Jim is constantly getting into trouble. He has been stubborn and troublesome ever since his father left the family. When an old spacer named Billy Bones dies at the Inn after giving Jim a gold sphere, the journey of a life time has begun. The sphere is actually a map that leads to the loot of a 1,000 worlds on Treasure Planet but many villainous pirates, lead by Long John Silver, are after the loot for themselves and will do anything to get it. Jim must have his wits about him to outsmart the most dangerous cyborg in the universe. The story of Treasure Planet is nothing short of spectacular. The classic novel by Robert Louis Stevenson is brought to life in a whole new way. Many of the elements that were in the book are the same here except for some minor details. It would have been better to explain more on why Jim's father leaves but it does seem better not to bog down the movie with minor details like that. The relationship between Silver and Jim is clearly the focus, which is better for the overall flow of the film.The characters are brilliantly brought to life by a fabulous cast in different areas. Brian Murry is clearly the perfect voice for the role of Long John Silver. He gives the old pirate great flavor and sounds just like he would sound coming from the classic book. Murray also plays off well with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who voices the rebellious Jim Hawkins. Their relationship is clearly the focus of the film and they do a good job of making good use of the story. Emma Thompson is great as Captain Amelia. Her use of large words within the course of the films allows the adults to enjoy themselves along with their kids. And who could forget Martin Short as B.E.N.? Though he appears late in the course of the film, he is one of the main highlights for this feature.Overall, Treasure Planet is quite possibly one of the best films of the year. One has to question why this film was delayed for so long. Maybe it was better that the technology needed to complete such a task was advanced enough to make it perfect as it is. There are little to no problems at all with this film. The only squabble is the small details missing from Jim's father leaving. Other then that, Treasure Planet is the perfect film to watch during the holiday season. The music was the best in a Disney Animated film for quite some time. Though there is only one song within the film, it is a fabulous one at that. The score is brilliantly done by James Newton Howard, who never ceases to amaze the music lovers out there. Some elements of Treasure Planet, though, maybe be too frightening and intense for younger viewers, so precaution is much needed from the parents. All and all, Treasure Planet joins the racks as one of the best of the year. A triumphant leap for animation, which shows it is still alive and well.My Rating: ***** out of 5",Treasure Planet
76,catdogmanfish,"This is not underrated, stop saying that",1,26 August 2021,"This movie is a mess. It's Disney's third adaptation of the Treasure Island story, as good as that story is Disney has just beaten it to death. This is a very showy and gimmicky movie, and for most people that covers up the bad writing, and annoying characters. I usually love Martin Short, but his character makes you want to stick your head in a microwave. Take off your nostalgia glasses and give this movie an honest watch, it is a mess, and it is not good.",Treasure Planet
77,amiranda-39274,The Best Disney Movie: The Loot of a 1000 Worlds!,9,16 May 2020,"Treasure planet has been my favorite Disney movie since I was a kid, it could be because this was a movie about space pirates and outer space, but I enjoyed the Disney princess films too, but this just feels like the most well made Disney movie ever.The Story: If your already familiar with the story of treasure island, you probably feel that you know what this move is already about, let me humbly tell you, your wrong. This movie takes the original story and elevates it to an unimaginable level. By placing the story of TI in space, so many fantastical elements are added that breath new life into the TI story and make you love the characters even more. The world of TP is supposed to be a steampunk fusion of the 1700s and future technology, which can be bizzare at first, like having normal ships just with solar sails and boosters, or like calling the sailors, spacers, since their ocean is the vastness of space. Every world and set piece is absolutely fantastic, being made with so much creativity and passion by the creators. Ron clements and John musker who were the directors of this movie and many other Disney renaissance movies, wanted to make a treasure island movie for years, but Disney wouldnt allow it until they made a bunch of successful Disney movies first, well they succeeded and they still were able to top them all off with this one.Characters: Again most of the characters of TI are in this, but each has a new creative addition to their characters. Jim Hawkins, is shown to be a rebellious teenager who grew up without a father ( which is bizzarely rare for a Disney character), we see his father abandoning him ( That's right not dying or missing, he leaves him)this deeply affects jims personality, and he feels he has no future, this is profoundly shown, and to watch jim develop from this rebel into a hero is truly inspiring. It should be no surprise that John silver is the villain of this movie, and the creators don't try to hide it, they have silver be secrety villainous for the audience to see, but no one in the movie discovers it until the reveal, this does not stop you from falling in love with the character, since the creators did everything humanely possible to make silver likeable as he establishes a father son relationship with jim. Its almost heartbreaking when you see silver be evil, which works very well, as silver is both a nice guy but can be a ruthless pirate, and his own character arc is amazing. The rest of the cast, are all likeable, the doctor, Captain Amelia, Ben and even that scary spider guy Scroop, all have their roles to play, and they do them great. I do regret that captain Amelia wasn't given more stuff to do towards the final act, but she gets many highlights in the middle. Also the opening with the story about Captain Flint, always made me want to see a longer story about him, hes just so evil and greedy, that his presence is still heavy in the last act, even though hes already dead.The Action: Its mind-blowing. The creators did not hold back at all and let their creativity explode on to the screen, literally. What's great about the action in this movie is that its not action for the sake of action it serves a purpose to add to the story. But my God, the action in this movie never gets tiring and there is so much of it that will make your jaw drop and hold your breath, especially the ending!The Animation: This was one of the first Disney movies that used 2d animation mixed with CGi. Now sometimes it can look choppy, and the 2d characters can get lost in it. But it adds to the fantastic visuals, and it still looks spectacular. There are so may moments where the cgi enhanced the scene. Like the ship taking off and the escape from treasure planet. Also we cant forget that silver was the first 2d character that had cgi parts, in this case his switchblade arm which just looks so fluid that I never noticed it for years. The paintings of space and the alien planets are just astonishing. Every frame is like a work of art.The Music: Its just glorious, it literally elevates every dramatic scene, every action scene to a emotional level that I cant even describe. I know a lot of people don't like it when a famous band or singer sings the song instead of the main character, but I think it works in this movie. The song "" Im still here"" is a beautiful song that shows a montage of Jim's life from his father leaving him to his new substitute, silver teaching Jim how to be a man and to be a great spacer. Its honestly one of the best song sequences in any Disney movie that is visually appealing and emotionally grabbing.This movie is incredible from beginning to end, and that's because the creators put all of their passion and creativity into it. It has everything you could ever want in a action movie, in fact its one of the most unique action movies ever made. Also it has so many deep themes about fatherhood, greed, and finding purpose, that I think, inspired so many children to become the best they can be. Silver gives truly uplifting speeches to Jim, that just inspired me to work hard and to be grateful for my own father being in my life. I have nothing but good memories watching this movie with my dad, who also considers this movie his favorite. This movie posses so much wonder that It filled me with so much imagination as a kid, with all the creative planets and aliens, that I started drawing because of it. I cant praise this movie enough, and it saddens me that this movie is still so underrated, when personally, I consider this the greatest treasure in Disney's Vault.",Treasure Planet
78,pintaxandre,Definitively not one of the best Disney's,7,9 April 2020,"There are a lot of flaws. The animation is not good enough for the standards of 2002. There is very little depths on the differents shots and the drawing is very apprximative and messy.
The plot is not great either. Too much plot holes and facilities to arrive to an obvious ending. The film starts off very quickly, but in a messy way and I had trouble to get directly invested, which was the case when the ship too off. The final scene is a bit too much, but whatever...
Now that I talked about the negative, let's come to what was actually worth watching:
The soundrack is good, although quite generic in Disney's long series of films.
The characters all had a personality and it was very easy to follow each one of them.
The story is basic, but easy to follow and it drives the point home.
Bu where this movie nailed it in my opinion is in buiding the relationship between the hero and the villain. The villain itself is generic, but how both characters interact and get to know each other is quite unusual for a Disney movie and I was very pleasantly surprised with it. That is the aspect of the film that stood out and for which I will remember it. Risk taken, but it was worthile. Sometimes Disney should try things like these more often.",Treasure Planet
79,bullions27,Disney's turn for the worst,1,1 December 2002,"Whatever accomplishment and respect they had achieved and redeemed with Lilo & Stitch (a pretty good film that didn't rely heavily on CGI) was sacrificed for this monstrosity of an adaptation. Treasure Planet is based loosely on Stevenson's novel but with none of its charm, wit or even a sense of adventure. Instead, we're presented with generic and boring cartoons we've all seen done a dozen times from previous Disney mistakes. It's actually quite similar to Atlantis but imagine pieces of cardboard talking on the screen.Jim Hawkins, the antagonist of this sorry tale, is the cliched adventurous young'on who yearns for the openess of space rather then his reclusive home. Well it just so happens luck was on his side (and pretty convenient for the writers) when someone drops him a map and a couple of vague warnings about riches, pirates and the whole enchilada. It gets pretty straightforward from here on out as he brings along comedic sidekicks aboard a galleon built for space travel (yes this is hilarious) of boring misfits pandering to 4-year olds (which I guess was the main intention of this film) while outwitting and outsurfing very evil and menacing space pirates.Thank you, Disney. My nephew will never forgive me for taking him to this after Lilo & Stitch.3/10",Treasure Planet
80,xsophietaylorx,One of my fondest Disney films,10,24 September 2014,"I absolutely adore this film and have watched it more times then I dare to count it really is just so exciting to watch. I deeply loved Jim Hawkings the rogue troubled boy who you can't help but love. The film is beautiful the scenery really is nice and you end up liking all the characters even the 'villain' John Silver. This film is animation, As you see the story unwind you see John a Silver start to form a bond with Jim and have a soft spot for him he learns how Jims father was never really around and always left suddenly and unexpectedly John sort of becomes a father fifer for him on the ship and almost takes Jim under his wings. The ending really is adorable as we see Jim being bought in a smart suit like, and we see how his mothers friend and the captain now have children! When we see John Silver leave it brought a tear to my eye the way his laugh dims out and the wink in the sky it's just to nice an idea of that John is always watching over Jim. Apart from the great film the soundtrack is also very good my favourite song on it being I'm still here.",Treasure Planet
81,masterekblasterek,A really great movie,9,21 September 2021,"Watching this movie I felt something different. This movie is different then the rest. Jim is a dreamer a real dreamer who feels sometimes like nobody. It suits me well to be honest. His relationship with John Silver is like father and son, but also feels that they don't trust each other at all, but they are weak to each other that's why this is so unique. The shown world is amazing a 3D moments look really good for 2002 movie. A real subversive masterpiece. The only - are that Mr. Arrow death is quickly forgotten and Scroop is a very interesting character that dies so quick.",Treasure Planet
82,L. Lion,surprisingly unimaginative,4,7 December 2002,"The idea of taking Treasure Island and casting it in space, complete with flying clipper ships and space pirates, sounds kinda nifty, and the previews looked like the usual terrific Disney animation.  But theory isn't practice, and in practice this Disney adventure is amazingly bland and unimaginative. This continues a downward trend in Disney cartoons that began with Hunchback of Notre Dame and became more pronounced with Tarzan and Atlantis.  This film rates about on par with Atlantis in that the theme is interesting and some of the animation and effects are spectacular, but after the first thirty minutes or so the film downgrades into Shtick Disney characters and hollow conflict.In this case, there are several problems that emanate from the characterizations.  The first is that Jim Hawkins is supposed to be a charismatic, bold young adventurer, when in reality he's just a bratty kid who does stupid things on rocket-powered sailboards.  The second is Dr. Doppler, the canine-alien scientist who backs the expedition to the Treasure Planet.  He shows up in a goofy space suit full of ridiculous contraptions that becomes dull after about two seconds.  He never develops into an interesting character, even when he is in the midst of a romance with the ship's captain (voiced by Emma Thompson).  Last is Morph, the cute animal sidekick.  Morph is some kind of creature that can change his shape (and his allegiances), and he is about as charming as Microsoft's clippy the animated paper clip.The eventual betrayal and conflict through the end of the film show just how weak the whole enterprise is.  By the time the forces of good and evil align themselves, Hawkins and the heavy, Long John Silver (here a cyborg instead of a pegleg) have bonded, and it was obvious that the best interests of all parties lay in patching up their differences and seizing the treasure together.The only good moments of note are provided by the feline captain (Emma Thompson) and by Silver, who is played with humanity.  The song performed by Jonathan Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls also covers a nice montage and develops the poignancy between Silver and Hawkins, the boy without a father. Although some of the animated scenes, especially the Serenity in flight with the space whales, deliver on some of the romance offered in the previews, this is flat and for the most part surprisingly unimaginative. Thumbs down.",Treasure Planet
83,pwoods1,A guilty pleasure,8,5 June 2005,"Given the status of Stevenson's classic novel, and the dubious notion of an adult enjoying a Disney movie, enjoyment of this film is a guilty pleasure indeed! I'm fairly careful as to which Disney productions I watch: having seen many of the originals as a child/teenager, I shudder at the thought of the many remakes this prolific studio creates. Most appear somewhat cynical attempts to make money from a new and equally impressionable audience. Having said that, the co-production of original and enjoyable films with Pixar (ALL of them) will remain favourites for all my life! Treasure Planet is NOT ""Pixarian"" but is, regardless, visually stunning and wonderfully voiced. Unlike many recent Disneys (Lion King et al.), songs are not over-used. Rzeznik's ""themes"" are well-chosen and well-sited within the movie: not only that, they are ENJOYABLE (almost as much as the Randy Newman input of Toy Story).The characters are well-developed and this, I feel, is due to a clever screenplay and inspired choice of voice talent.Some critics have pointed to the less-than-evil ""Silver"", but this film, above all else, is about interrelationships - something Disney do well or exceptionally badly. In this case, they do it marvellously.Full marks! A pleasure indeed.",Treasure Planet
84,bluzman,"Finally, Disney gets back to what Disney does best",6,1 January 2003,"I really hadn't planned on seeing this film, but my son and I decided to see it instead of going with the girls to see Maid in Manhattan.  We were both delighted with our choice by the end of the movie. It is visually pleasing and executed in the traditional Disney high standard.This movie is Disney doing what Disney does best. It is an animated tale that doesn't twist, distort, change or generally re-write history/reality for the convenience of selling the movie.  Pocahontas is a perfect example of how Disney hasn't got a clue how to retell actual history.  Bambi is a perfect example of skewed reality.  After the scene where the evil hunter and his dogs - illegal for deer hunting - run rampant through the woods shooting indiscriminately shooting at everything in sight - would never happen - and finally burn the woods down, it is little wonder that a generation of anti-hunters use Bambi Hunter as one of their anthems.This movie, on the other hand,  takes a well known tale is spins it into a fantasy outer space adventure.  It follows the original closely enough in concept to be worthy of using the name.  It is sort of on the theory of all movies actually being cowboy movies.  Maybe all cowboy movies can also be space adventures.In any respect, this is a fine movie that will probably never reach the classic proportions of many of Disney's other less worthy tales.  That is a shame.",Treasure Planet

86,rorymacveigh,A Good stab at an old time story,8,19 September 2012,"Often considered the bane of every literature based person, modernisation tactics in movies of old stories often end up being smashed critically and commercially. I seem to remember when this came out, Treasure Island fans were up in arms and ready to burn every cinema this film was playing in because they were afraid it would destroy the reputation of the classic novel. But really, I don't see what the problem is with this film, because it's actually really really good! I mean the idea of taking the original novel and setting it in space with robots and aliens may seem blasphemous to some, but really once you look beyond that, the film doesn't take the story too far off track, it just takes it into the future and adds robots and aliens.In my own opinion, I find this film has a lot to tell viewers. It has all the famous characters, including Jim Hawkins, Long John Silver and all the other memorable faces from the story, but it tweaks their appearance slightly in order to make them set into the futuristic scene, and it does come up with some really original designs. Jim Hawkins is the emotionally unbalanced teenager who wants to escape his mundane life to explore the stars. Long John Silver is the mysterious cyborg ships cook who actually has a very good design to his appearance, including the robotic limbs and eye that do look pretty awesome for a character. He also has a heart of gold, even being a Pirate leader, he slowly forms a fatherly relationship with Jim which Jim had never had since it is revealed his father walked out on them when he was just a boy, leaving him with no guidance or anything to work towards. With this relationship, John Silver starts to make Jim come out of his shell, making him a much stronger character with more confidence and resolve to make his own way in life rather than just sticking to the simplicity he has forced himself to stay with.On top of this, the animation is fantastic, the storyline is very close to the original, with the minor tweak here and there to make scenes from the original novel fit in more with the modern image, and it has some good strong characters (although I find BEN like many Martin Short characters quite annoying after the first 10 minutes). Overall, a great attempt at bringing the story of Treasure Island to a more younger audience and I'd recommend it to anyone of any age because not only does it have a great visual story to tell, it also has a morale that we can all learn from.",Treasure Planet

What I will comment on was its ability to draw me into its world, a world with some very memorable characters who actually develop over the course of the film.My personal favorite was the captain, an English feline who's tough as nails yet still very proper and possessing a vast vocabulary which she puts to good use.  Backing her up is her steady-as-a-rock first mate who appears to be living rock but unfortunately dies at the hands of a spiderlike creature voiced by Michael Wincott (when is this guy going to become a star?).  But the real character of the movie is Captain Silver, a man who pretends to be Jim Hawkins' friend but somewhere along the way forgets that and becomes an actual friend.I know this movie is good for one simple reason.  Before seeing it, I wasn't really in the mood for seeing a movie; in fact, I was in a bit of a funk. But when I walked out, I was uplifted.  I had experienced the magic of the film, and I was reminded how great the medium of film is.To all those of you who saw it and didn't like it, tell me what movie you saw and what was so bad about it, because as far as I'm concerned, this movie is another success for Disney.",Treasure Planet
89,proffate,"Not bad, despite ignoring Science 101",6,2 September 2003,"Classic stories are always worth retelling, but certain rules must be observed. If you want to make your spaceships look like 17th century sailing vessels, there should be a reason why they look like that.
You should also explain why they ignore rules like the absence of oxygen in space. (Simple enough; when they activate ""artificial gravity,"" an ""atmosphere bubble"" could also be created.) Then there's the problem of propulsion. Solar winds and the sails to capture them are fine within the limited confines of star systems, but useless in the vast interstellar voids.That said, the basic story is a classic and the animation is outstanding. Too bad the above problems weren't addressed or it might not have been such a disaster at the box office.",Treasure Planet

91,TheFunkyBass,One of the most underrated animated movies ever.,7,13 May 2015,"Let me start by saying that the soundtrack is great. The musical score was composed by James Newton Howard, while the songs were written and performed by John Rzeznik, frontman of the Goo Goo Dolls.The story is a futuristic adaption of the classic book Treasure Island. The animation is sublime, it blends 2D and 3D perfectly, the steampunk design is also pretty cool. It's a rreal shame it was a box office failure. At least it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.If you haven't watched it yet, do it now. It's worth your time.",Treasure Planet
92,LeathermanCraig,"Disney's take on 'Treasure Island' - and not a bad take, either...",8,29 January 2004,"'Treasure Planet' is another of many solid Disney animations.  We all know the story of 'Treasure Island' and it is only slightly modified for it's futuristic, outer space setting.  The characters are all fully realized and you can care about them, much as you would for a live actor version of the story.  The voices fit the characters and they 'act' with feeling and care.Overall, this is a solid B+ or A- film and a pleasant way to spend a few hours - even if it's only on DVD and video....  A great choice!",Treasure Planet
93,mntwister,DISNEY'S BEST IN YEARS,9,21 May 2003,"Forget the smaller amount that this film took in at the boxoffice and go and buy yourself a real treat of a movie..TREASURE PLANET.  I was in awe at the ground-breaking quality of the animation, the musical score is an 11 out of ten, the characters in line with the very best of Disney.  I can't think of anyone this would not appeal to.I bought the dvd yesterday and am on my second (going on 3rd) viewing on my front projector, and all I can say is WOW. The soundtrack is good enough to qualify as one of my demo discs for my home theatre, and so is the video quality.  But the feeling and emotion and what the film has to say is what is important, and this film succeeds on every level. I won't go into the story, as alot of people have, but it really saddens me that after what must have been years of labor, this film was poorly promoted by the Disney advertising department, and I should hope that those people are no longer with the studio, for Disney's own good, because this should have been a multi-million dollar smash. I am 40 years old, and the first time viewed it with children of ages 8 and 13 and they never moved out of their chair!Rent it, or better yet BUY THE DVD....you will watch it more than once and the 2nd time see brand new things you missed. I expect the 3rd time will be the same, that is how awesome this animation and storytelling is.",Treasure Planet
94,sketchyninja,animated treasure,8,8 July 2007,"A fantastic tale and is wonderfully rewritten for space. Animation is breathtaking with the outer space scenes drawn so well that it looks like it was taken from a telescope. Characters are typical for a Disney movie and you feel for them and what they are struggling through. The heroes and villains are done remarkably well, with one of the multi-limbed antagonists taking a special place in cartoon villainy. It has straight action all the way through with very little time for breath and makes you almost believe that you could actually travel through space like this. A real rush with the hoverboard scenes. A superb action movie for the family with a few genuine scary moments and images thrown in.",Treasure Planet

This movie has a great blend of science, fantasy, and adventure. I'm an old school sci/fi fan from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series where the inhabitants of Mars traveled in flying ships. I think this recipe of Robert Louis Stevenson meets Edgar Rice Burroughs meets Disney is a complete total winning combination. It is disheartening to hear of the poor box office results for ""Treasure Planet"" opening weekend.

96,sebastianali123,A epic and unforgettable adventure,8,17 December 2020,"Like the movie Atlantis the lost empire, this movie has been greatly underrated and shared the same fate. And yes, it shares some of its flaws, such as the lack of development of some elements that the plot introduces or the characters. However, if you let all this pass, the sense of adventure is spectacular. The settings and animation have also aged incredibly well by today's standards, with flawless 2d / 3d usage not feeling forced at all (which explains why so much money was spent developing the film in the first place). And in the case of the story, although several things still need to be developed, I love all the genres that it plays and the characters are full of life. They are very memorable and you will remember them. Highly recommended. The movie could have been better, but it deserved to be appreciated more for everything it did. Disney has given us an epic and unforgettable adventure.",Treasure Planet
97,hfhfdfse,what a disappointment,3,4 April 2005,"Based on R.L.Stevenson's Treasure Island. A children's classic adapted for a modern Sc-Fi stories adoring audience. Instead of the 19th c. Britain the story starts somewhere in the outer space on a tiny planet where Jim Hawkins comes in possession of a map showing the way to captain flint's treasure. If you read the book or saw any of numerous screen versions of Stevenson's masterpiece made previously, you know the rest. Jim and Doctor charter a ship, I mean. a spaceship, they get John Silver as cook without knowing who he really is, they travel to the Treasure IslandoopsI mean, Treasure Planet. What else to say? No sudden plot twists, everything is so familiar. No jokes, no good song to whistle after the movie. Is there a point is seeing a film if you know the story from the beginning to the end by heart? Making this story more modern brought the screen writers the idea of creating some female characters. This way Captain Amelia was born: strong, independent, career oriented with the voice provided by Emma Thompson. They also made Silver less evil. He befriends with Jim and there are some father to son talk scenes. But all in all why on earth was this animated feature produced? They definitely should not have put this ad on DVD box: from the creators of Aladdin. Aladdin was brilliant. Treasure Planet is not half as good.",Treasure Planet
98,moviecritichank-7,"If you love Star Wars, then you'll love Treasure Planet",10,2 February 2010,"Treasure Planet is an Sci-Fi animated film released by Walt Disney Pictures in November of 2002. When I first saw the previews of this great film, I said ""Wow, this is going to be the best movie ever."" While it isn't the best movie I've ever seen, it certainly is one of the best Disney movies ever and sadly, it is so underrated. It is the story of a young boy named Jim Hawkins (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt from ""Angels in the Outfield"") who is very adventurous and yet constantly in trouble. But then, after a space pirate named Billy Bones (voiced by Patrick Mcgoohan) arrives at his mother's inn, he gives Jim the map to an old treasure stashed away by Captain Flint, ""The Loot of a Thousand World's."" Now, accompanied by Dr. Doppler (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), Jim is determined to find it. He then sets sail aboard the RLS Legacy (named after Robert Louis Stevenson, author of Treasure Island) and meets a cyborg named John Silver (voiced by Brian Murray) who is made out to be a villain (when I first saw this, I thought he was) but actually turns out to be the father figure Jim never had. I found a few similarities to Star Wars: the comical robot B.E.N. (voiced by Martn Short) is similar to C-3PO in quite a few ways and the concept of a Solar Surfer (which was an amazing sequence) is similar to the Podracers from ""Phantom Menace."" My favorite character is definitely Jim. Treasure Planet has everything: action, explosions, suspense, stunning, out of this world animation that combines 2-D and 3-D, a thrilling treasure hunt, lessons of self discovery, and yet another amazing Disney score composed by James Newton Howard. It also stars Emma Thompson (Captain Amelia), Michael Wincott (Scroop), and Roscoe Lee Browne (Mr. Arrow). This is a movie I own on DVD (I have a lot of Disney movies) and if you haven't seen it yet, rent it. Rating: 10/10!",Treasure Planet
99,t-hf,"One of Disney's best, yet largely ignored masterpieces",10,23 April 2014,"This is definitely a stand out for me in Disney's cannon, despite how forgotten it is in the studio's current era. I know some might think it blasphemous to say this, but at the time it came out, Treasure Planet affected me deeper than The Lion King, Aladdin or any of the Disney Renaissance films combined. I don't really know what it is about the film that did so, when you consider that although it's based on classic source material, the idea to adapt Treasure Island to a sci-fi setting seems a little silly.The film is basically a re-telling of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island with some minor differences and some major differences. Despite it's vast changes, every difference works in the film's favour, at least for me. For instance, the main character Jim Hawkins is a rebellious, generation x style youth, the antagonist pirate John Silver has more of a genuine ""soft spot"" for Jim and the captain of the ship is now a female, cat-human hybrid. For those of you who don't know, the story is pretty much the same as the novel - Jim Hawkins comes into contact with a treasure map that leads him to ""Treasure Planet"". He is then whisked away on a ship with a hired crew in search of the planet, whilst making friends with the ship's mysterious cook John Silver. It's quite incredible that Disney manage to improve on such a classic novel by changing the setting, which is very hard to do. I think the strong point of this film is the relationship between Jim and Silver. Although both characters represent the classic Good/Evil dynamic, Jim ultimately sees Silver as a father figure and inspiration by the film's conclusion, resulting in one of the most tear- jerking ""parting of the ways"" scenes that I have ever seen when Silver leaves. Although Silver gets away with his crimes in the novel, he is still the villain at the end of the book, but in this adaptation, you are genuinely sad to see him go despite the bad things he has done. Other than that, the relationships between the other characters are also great and have their own unique quality. This, coupled with timeless animation, refreshing humour and exciting action - make Treasure Planet an unforgettable and genuinely touching animation. If you haven't seen it already, I highly recommend it as one of Disney's best.",Treasure Planet
100,carlabrams,Not your usual Disney film,8,30 January 2004,"Slight spoilersFirst off, let me say that we watched this film on DVD, and our family loved it.  BUT - this was geared more to the age of my kids, who are teenagers, and not your typical Disney pre-teen audience.  That, I think, is one reason why this didn't do so well in the theatres - they targeted the wrong audience.  Your normal 5 - 10 year olds just aren't going to get a lot of the teenage angst in this movie.Also, that they went for a film based on the Robert Louis Stevenson classic meant that, if you'd read the book, you'd see a lot of things that you could get - but if you hadn't, they'd just go over your head.  Again, targeting an older audience would probably have helped.  (Let's face it - little kids can watch Beauty & the Beast 50 times a day - not this one.)You can forgive them regarding space and vacuum - perhaps there was some bubble of atmosphere, or their clothing generated atmosphere - who cares about that, it's a cartoon, I can forgive them that one.  That was at least consistent throughout the movie.  But the inconsistency was in the gravity field.  I could see the first mate being pulled away because he was drawn by the stronger gravity well of the pulsing black hole.  But the spidery guy should have been drawn back to the ship.  It seemed that they played sort of loose with gravity, which I can't really agree with.",Treasure Planet
101,agirlwhoreallylovesmovies,Truly wonderful and beautifully animated,8,1 December 2002,"A good friend of mine and my husband's treated us to ""Treasure Planet"" on Wednesday, and I must say that it was an absolutely fabulous movie. Joseph Gordon-Leavitt does the voice of young Jim Hawkins, one of the most attractive cartoon characters I've seen lately. Everyone knows the plot, so I won't drag you down with trite details. My favorite character in the movie was Morph, an adorable little pink blob not unlike the ""Flubber"" from the Robin Williams film of the same name from '97. But I must say that my absolute favorite part of the movie was the female feline captain of the ship - Captain Amelia, voiced wonderfully by Emma Thompson. What I liked the best about Captain Amelia was that she was a cat - and that there was a woman in charge of the ship. She was strong, independent, and quite simply a excellent role model for girls watching the movie. David Hyde-Pierce plays Dr. Doppler the same way he plays Niles from ""Frasier"", with an irresistable charm and fussiness that is totally charming. I give ""Treasure Planet"" a five out five. An all-around great movie for anyone!",Treasure Planet
102,elroy_geronimo,Finally they achieved greatness again,9,9 December 2002,"After seeing this movie I'm convinced Disney's back on track again. I liked Lilo & Stitch but that was more because of the Elvis filled soundtrack than because of the story or the characters. I had become a Disney-hater because all their flicks were rehashing the same old samo. Take a great story totally demolish it let the characters sing some boooooooooring songs (blerk) and add a funny side-kick with a famous voice and because they are the only worldwide distributed animation-producers numb the mind of millions of children and empty their parents pockets with all the merchandise. Well they will be still doing that I guess. Old habits, especially bad ones, die hard.......... But back to the movie. For starters there's only one song in Treasure Planet and it isn't even sung by the characters. The adaptation of Treasure Island is a great one. Not only have they finally used their imagination, the animation is fantastic. Best of all are all the wacky extras, which reminded me a bit of ""Sen To Chihiro Yo Kamikakushi"" (aka Spirited away), still the most amazing animation-flick I've ever seen, so that's no small compliment. I heard they bought the GHIBLI-studio's and I hope Disney will be GHIBLI-ed instead of GHIBLI getting Disney-ed, as I feared when I heard the news. Treasure Planet restored my faith in Disney and finally old Walt will be proud of this movie instead of turning around in his coffin in shame(It's a roughly translated Dutch saying).

There is a nice relationshipshown between Jim Hawkins and John Silver, but the othercharacters are mainly annoying ""types."" One exception: the captainof the ship, who is voiced by Emma Thompson. In her Britishaccent, she uses her extensive vocabulary as a weapon. Example,when explaining something to a rather dense character: ""Let memake this as monosyllabic as possible.""

Indeed, one of the things I like about this movie is that, while remaining true to the spirit of Stevenson, the writers chose to depart from the original in a number of innovative ways that make this its own movie, rather than just an animated remake.I gave this an 8 out of 10:  definitely worth seeing and a movie that will hold up on repeat viewings (very important when you have kids and a DVD player!).",Treasure Planet
108,drdave,Brain-dead idea with nice visuals,4,16 June 2003,"First of all, there's no air in space, so everyone would suffocate.  That may have made for a more interesting - if shorter - story.  Second, solar sails require a fair amount of sunlight and would be practically useless in interplanetary space.  Third, the radiation from a supernova would fry anyone near it, so you can't ""ride the shock wave"".  These sorts of liberties being taken are a major contributor to the difficulties science teachers have in getting students to unlearn what they think they know.Now I'll get off my soapbox.The CGI sequences in the movie are well done, although they were obviously CGI.  The animation is sub-par for Disney (did they fire all their good artists??) but about average for the an industry that has lowered its standards considerably over the last 40-50 years.  The retelling of Treasure Island with a space twist just does not work.However, for some reason I'm in a charitable mood.  Give it a 4 out of 10 only because I can't give it a 3.5.",Treasure Planet

An actual reinterpretation of a classic, so that it loses nothing of its value. The characters are well structured, like Jim, like Silver is a well-written figure. The source of humor there is Dr. Dopler, BEN is the island's native robot, and Morph is the cute animal replacing the parrot. His animation is simply a fantastic structure of 2D figures, with 3-dimensional backgrounds still standing still today. The lyrics are easy to quote, especially if you've seen the movie 200 times.

It's been a while since I just sat down and enjoyed a movie, so I probably neglected some, if not a lot, of the bad things about this film. Anyway, this movie took me on a journey I will not soon forget, one which I am eager to re-visit any time soon.To start off, I consider it mandatory to mention the wonderful animation in this film. The designers of this movie managed to combine the traditionally-drawn characters and set pieces with some masterfully placed computer generated technology. I have to say that I thought I was watching a movie that just appeared some days ago and not a film over 10 years of age. I read somewhere that more than 40 animators worked on this film, and although I am not familiar if this is a strong number or not, I do consider it to be so. Still, what good would great animation do, if not combined with some great voice work from the actors. Stand- outs for me were Emma Thompson as Captain Amelia, Brian Murray as Long John Silver and Martin Short as B.E.N.. I want to add two more things to this section, the first being Tony Jay, who did a great work narrating this film, and the other is mentioning a 21 year old Joseph Gordon- Levitt working on this film. I didn't recognize his voice while watching the film and was a bit surprised to see that he was the one in the role of Jim Hawkins.The original way this story was adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, made me consider this space adventure one of the best pirate films I've seen. Add to the wonderful scenes of action and emotion a great score by James Newton Howard and you will surely get a fine film in my opinion. For any science fiction, adventure or pirate fans out there, you definitely need to check this one out.",Treasure Planet
111,impfac,"Bold, imaginative, but lacking good writing",6,9 September 2004,"Visually, Treasure Planet is an achievement. The idea is imaginative, fresh and fun. The story is predictable but good. But the writing is weak and the movie ends up uneven. Parts are extremely funny, other parts are painfully labored and distinctly flat.The death knell is the appearance of the android character Ben in the last half hour or so. He is something like a Jerry Lewis impression, loud and grating. He is the official Zany Comic Relief, but he feels like he's been squeezed out of a constipated writer.

117,Company_of_Wolves,Swashbuckling Science Fiction,7,16 January 2006,"Treasure Planet is the adaptation of the classic swashbuckling children's tale of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. R.L.S originally wrote Treasure Island chapter by chapter for his son, as a bed time story for each night. When the story was first published it was actually condemned by some! Claiming that such violent tales encouraged boys to become ner-do-well's such as the pirates it glorifies! Suffice to say, Disney's futuristic adaptation fails to capture the rebellious nature of the original Treasure Island. Fans and fanatics can gripe all they want if a scene is missing from the book, or if a character's been changed, but as long as the core meaning of the story remains, it's essence. Then adaptation has been successful. Treasure Planet does not capture the essence of the book entirely, in fact it lacks a lot of it's power due mainly to the protagonist. Jim Hawkins of Treasure Planet does not suffer as much as his archaic counterpart, therefore his character does not under go the same heroic journey and does not emerge as profoundly changed as R.L.S original did.Aside from that, Treasure Planet makes for a fine adventure film for the whole family. There are moments of joy and pathos to be found throughout. And it is interesting to see a science fiction twist on a pirating classic.",Treasure Planet

Secondly why where Jim and his mom the only humans on the planet? And most importantly of all what's with the relationship between Jim and Silver.

The CGI sometimes doesn't bland well with the hand drawn and the movie doesn't have a focus on its tone. But they are all far from enough to kip this away from being a very solid feature. The characters are well presented, the animation is creative, the action is intense, some of the humour does work and there are some characters that provides good voice acting. Ben and Jim are still not enjoyable, but that's just a minor problem for the rest of the movie. For my recommendation, I had say this is worth checking out. Especially for Disney or Si-Fi fans.

The characters are fantastic, and the voice talents bring them to life in every case.The story is about a fifteen year old boy, Jim Hawins, who has been scared emotionally when he was very young, when his father left. Jim has a stroke of luck and finds a small, golden sphere and unlocks its power. To his amazement, he finds out it is a map to a treasure planet, where the evil pirate, Captin Nathaniel Flint, has stored his bounty. He is immediately whisked off into a wild adventure, meeting John Silver, the friendly galley worker, who he starts to look up too as a substitute father, and many other wacky characters too.People who say that this film is a disappointment, what on earth is wrong with it? Anyway, I loved it - make your own decision...",Treasure Planet
123,Daigh,Wonderful and funny adaptation,8,7 December 2002,"Sometimes I wonder what's happened to the sense of humor in the US. This movie does not deserve the drubbing it's getting. It's funny, fun, has a lot of heart, and given the 'updating' to the future, is a surprisingly accurate adaptation of Stevenson's classic work.The combination/change of a few characters is well done, and Morph is one of the cutest sidekick characters in some time. The Disneyfying touches were amusing. Adding the romance and some dialogue nods to Star Trek enhanced the story.See it. It's only 'fault' is that it's competing with HP and the Chamber of Horrors (also a super movie) and Santa Claus 2 (also worth seeing.) Give this middle child a chance.8/10PS: And for those of you who are complaining about scientific inaccuracies. Get over it!! This is animation and supposed to be fun.",Treasure Planet

(which he also wrote ""Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). Treasure Planet needs to be watched multiple times to understand the whole world of Jim Hawkins. It has this realist features if you understand what he has been through before the film started. It shows Jim that he is trying to find who he is and what he really wants in his life and it is really rewarding at the end. Jim just wants to redeem himself in order to proving what he is by going on an adventure to find the famous Captain Flint's treasure. Some minor characters are great at times and slides off at times but it does fit the space pirate Sci-fi adventure.",Treasure Planet
125,jdsanders-21163,Best Disney movie ever!,10,7 August 2018,"Disney is my least favorite movie company, and hardly any of their movies are good. But this was awesome! And it gives me the vibe of Titan AE, another good movie! (This and Titan are like star wars, except for the part that they are actually good movies) and everything about this movie is awesome! I am surprised that such a good movie as Treasure was made by Disney, which is, like, the worst movie company ever in my opinion. And even better, video games! The games that spawned off of this movie were just as awesome. You need to see the movie and play the games. Some say this is a rip off of Titan. It has a lot in common, but it is not a rip off. They are both some of the best movies ever. I guess I like Titan more. Idk. But check this movie out!",Treasure Planet
126,ktgc,A movie that doesn't seem right,8,30 November 2002,"There is something wrong with Treasure Planet. The drawings and the computer animations are impressive, but the story is confusing and unrealistic. If the story can display a clear line between good and evil, it may be more fun to watch. It seems that Disney is trying to get the movie to the theatre as quick as possible and it doesn't want to invest more time to develop the characters more clearly. With no romance and confusing characters development, this movie will not generate big bug for Disney as it hopes for.",Treasure Planet
127,lilmufasa2,"No songs, no fun, no deal",9,16 August 2008,"I must admit, this film just plain sucked. When you mix the classic work of Robert Louis Stevenson, mix it with Star Wars and forget to add songs and you get a blob of S**t. Musker and Clemments fell short with forgetting Alan Menken who had been vital to their work in Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Hercules. Action films are not what todays youth want to see. What happened to the classics like Cinderella, Snow White, Jungle Book, Beauty and the beast, lion king, and Hunchback of Notre Dame. We want those, Not this Crap. Going to theaters, i expected a film with at least one good song and one good or funny character. My opinion is that they should've had the robot voiced as a REAL comedian like Robin Willaims.",Treasure Planet
128,Tinny-Tinette,"A great voyage to ""Treasure Planet""",7,23 August 2014,"In the early 2000's, Disney went away from their traditional formula that they used in the 90's and started to exploring with some different genres, with both comedy (""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Home on the Range"") and sci-fi (""Atlantis"", ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""Treasure Planet""). Being an older teen at the time, I thought it was refreshing that Disney went away from their formula and expanded their horizons a little. Afterwards none of these films have been perceived as classics and most of them were box office failures (with the exception of ""Lilo & Stitch""). However, most of these films were quite enjoyable, even those much panned efforts as ""Home on the Range"" and ""Atlantis"". One of the most marketed of these films were ""Treasure Planet"" which had the unfortunate fate of being a box office failure, probably because of many reasons. Which is a pity, since ""Treasure Planet"" really deserved more recognition.When I saw ""Treasure Planet"" initially, I thought it was fine, but nothing memorable and remarkable. However, the film has grown on me and I've ranked it higher on my list. It's not a so-called Disney classic, but it's still a darn good movie and better than ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""Brother Bear"". Despite it's sci-fi approach, it still has the classical and recognizable Disney-vibe, more than ""Atlantis"" and ""Lilo"" had.Where ""Treasure Planet"" really excels is in terms of it's visual and it's music. The film is visually stunning, with many bright and luminous colors and while the blending of the CGI elements isn't always seamless, it's still great to look at. Continuing the non-musical approach of the early 2000's, ""Treasure Planet"" is a non-musical, but is replaced by an epic and beautiful score by James Newton Howard. Although the film is set in outer space, it still keeps a Gaelic vibe to the soundtrack.The screenplay is quite good. It starts a little slow, but expands after-wards and becomes more engaging and captivating, with much action and clever twists. The film is the brainchild of directors John Musker and Ron Clements, who are responsible for Disney's biggest successes. As with their other projects, ""Treasure Planet"" is big on action, but lacks the witty and spunky humor that dominated both ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules"". However, the film isn't deprived by humor and gets some cute gags and some clever lines here and there.The Silver/Jim dynamic is the heart of the picture and is skilfully executed. Cudos for making Silver one of the most complex antagonists in the Disney history. While the characterizations aren't as memorable as prior Disney flicks, they are still engaging. The most successful character is with no doubt Captain Amelia, brilliantly voiced by Emma Thompson. David Hyde Pierce is fine as Dr. Doppler and Brian Murray makes a good Silver. More grating is Martin Short as B.E.N. While the character becomes more tolerable in later viewings, he's still a failed attempt as a comic relief for this movie.If there's any flaw with ""Treasure Planet"", it's the characterization of Jim Hawkins himself. Voiced by Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, he's one of the least memorable and engaging lead characters in a Disney film ever made. While he's not particularly awful, he's quite personality-deprived and forgettable.""Treasure Planet"" does take a clever attempt to bring a new touch to the story by setting it in space, but is surprisingly enough not so much futuristic, mostly thanks to the 70/30 law they had in the movie (70 classic/30 futuristic). However, the setting does have some contrivances, as having sailing ships. Or how about that Jim and his mother (who actually looks about his age) are the only humans set in a planet where most of the creatures are aliens or animal-like creatures? However, I'm just nitpicking.At the end, ""Treasure Planet"" is a good ride and it's a film worth watching. I'll warmly recommend it and it deserves to be recognized by a large audience.",Treasure Planet
129,info-494,Excellent Balance!,8,13 January 2003,"I really didn't expect much from the premise: ""Treasure Island in space"". But it worked. The characters are beautifully developed and some of them are quite deep, specially ""cyborg"". The blend of CGI and classic animations is 100% perfect! Breathtaking action scenes mixed with beautiful characters. Some of them die... keeping the Disney tradition of: ""face it kids, that's the way it is"". Which is fine.Hurray for Disney!, ... again!",Treasure Planet
130,BenD25,Unjustifiably Overlooked,8,20 February 2014,"The 2000's was a tough decade for Disney Animation, as the studio moved from one box office disappointment to another. In their defense, they were exploring new territories, experimenting with new animation styles, non-Disney-like narratives and even the songs were either non-diegetic or non-existent. ""Treasure Planet"" is the studio's most ambitious project from that period. By the time it came out I had lost interest in animated movies so I didn't catch it, but in recent years with my renewed love for animation, I did some catching up and have watched it around 4 or 5 times. I found it somewhat similar to 2001's ""Atlantis"" as it too evolves around an underdog boy trying to prove the existence of a mythical world. ""Treasure Planet"" is the more solid effort, though. The story is well-structured, and its outer space setting gave way for some pretty stunning visuals. If I was let down by anything, it was their choice to go with Cyborgs and UFOs (if that's the right term) as the individuals that inhabit both Hawkins' planet and the ship. This is probably John Musker and Ron Clements' least known film since their 1989 blockbuster ""The Little Mermaid"" revived the genre. It's a shame, though, as this is a commendable effort that should be getting much, much more recognition.",Treasure Planet
131,SuperNerd17,Most Underrated Disney Movie,9,19 July 2019,"Treasure Planet is the most underrated Disney movie to date. The amount of time (10 years total production) and effort going into it was a massive endeavor. The payoff was nothing short of amazing. Even though the story is based off the classic novel, Treasure Island, it is still phenomenal. With loveable characters (Morph is an obvious favorite) and their relationships, the movie does a good job of quickly establishing their quirks, motivations, and development.The best quality of the film is the score and animation. The sense of wonder you experience as the ship takes off and sores through space is euphoric. You are literally experiencing two worlds: space and the ocean - at the same time! Combining these two atmospheres together is majestic and thrilling. You see a huge universe and wildlife flowing through it. The imagination is endless.A wonderful experience and fantastic overall production. Treasure Planet definitely got the short end of the stick with reception from critics and deserves far more praise then it received.",Treasure Planet
132,geode,My least favorite Disney animated film,3,20 November 2004,"A friend of mine actually was an animator that worked upon this film, and I went to see it hoping to like it even though the concept of adapting ""Treasure Island"" into a sci-fi motif worried me. What I was not expecting was to dislike almost everything in the production except some of the animation, and that I would elect it as my all-time least favorite Disney animated feature. I think it is obvious why most people wisely avoided this film (causing a rare write-down of profits by the studio). Basically the film seemed to be pointless and rather boring. It sort of idles along and not much really ever happens. I felt myself squirming in my seat and pondering the dumb elements that simply don't work as I waited anxiously for the film to end. Using a tall-masted design for spaceships, where people can roam on the decks with no fear of breathing....having characters that are of different species becoming romantically involved...yuuch ! But then when it should have gotten better, towards the end, we are introduced to a Martin Short voiced character that is even more irritating and obnoxious than Jar Jar Binks. What in the world was the thinking behind the inclusion of this character ? A monster named Flatula that makes fart-like sounds ? Brilliant ! The sad thing is that the massive losses from releasing this over-priced production led to Disney killing all plans for 2D animation. Using 2D animation is not the problem here, it is the rather ill-advised concept and the awful script that was used.",Treasure Planet
133,gerhajdu,One of the best animated films,8,22 July 2006,"Simply stunning. Treasure PLanet is an adaptation of Treasure Island and I didn't know that movie but I think it's very good as a pirate story, so I didn't care how faithful adaptation it is. The first score for the film is the visuals and atmosphere, it is the most fascinating animated film I've ever seen. Combination of old-fashioned technology and hi-tech is a great idea that makes the film look really unique.The second score is characters, because they are so lifelike and lovable. The connection between Jim Hawkins and the cyborg John Silver is touching and memorable, it's absolutely the best part of the film. I loved the major characters too, especially because of humour, like Dr. Doppler, Morph and B.E.N. (who can be usually too annoying). In fact, my favourite is Captain Amelia who is a hard, refine and brave captain and her half-cat appearance very suit her. I loved.The story after all is enjoyable and it is serious enough to adults enjoy it. The end is great and (at leas for me) surprising. I have found some plot holes but eventually main storyline is beaten.I can recommend Treasure Planet for anyone who likes good traditional animation and fairy-tale-like science fiction. Just take a look at Disney's new masterpiece and you will surely have a good time.",Treasure Planet
134,vortex100,Pleasant and entertaining,7,26 December 2002,"Although a small caliber offering from Disney studios most everyone will find this story entertaining and interesting.

A familiar rehash, yes, but much better than many similar tales.",Treasure Planet
135,kalel6868,Incredible Visuals Compensate for an Overly Familiar Story,8,3 December 2002,"Robert Louis Stephenson's `Treasure Island' has always been one of my favorite classic stories.  The tale of a teenage boy thrust into the adventure of a lifetime features pirates, swordfights, an ocean voyage, betrayals, and buried treasure among many other classic adventure-story ingredients  what's not to love?It's been filmed countless times before, in many various incarnations, including one with the Muppets and an animated version starring the Monkees' Davy Jones; so what new way can be thought up to retell this hundred-year-old story for twenty-first century audiences?Set it in space, of course;  a brilliant idea that pays off handsomely.To be fair, TREASURE PLANET is not the first film to set the story among the stars; that distinction belongs to the 1987 Italian live-action TV Mini-series TREASURE ISLAND IN OUTER SPACE. But that version has scarcely been seen outside of Europe, and I seriously doubt that it could hold a candle to the stunning visuals seen here.And the key word here is VISUALS.  This is arguably the most visually stunning animated film to come out of the powerhouse Disney animation factory, EVER.  The canvas on which they paint here is wide and broad, and full of breathtaking color and beauty.  Pirate ships with solar sails soar across a canopy of stars, and behemoths that look like whales trumpet along beside them.  Alien beings both friendly and fierce populate the universe, and futuristic machinery stands side-by-side with nineteenth century technology.  I've never seen anything quite like it.Oh, and there is a story here as well; amazingly, it is quite faithful to the source material in both outline and details, only deviating from the text where necessary to transplant the action from the oceans of nineteenth century Earth to the planets and solar systems of the future.It centers around Jim Hawkins, a fatherless boy constantly getting into trouble with the law for his rambunctious, extreme-sports ways, who gets the chance to prove himself when a dying pirate leaves him a treasure map with his dying breath.  In short order he finds himself cabin boy on a stargoing vessel bound for the legendary Treasure of a Thousand Worlds; along the way path is blocked by pirates and collapsing stars and other perils of interstellar travel.If I have any complaint at all with the film it would be that it sticks a little TOO close to the novel, some of the nineteenth century ideals just don't ring true in the futuristic setting; but that's easily forgivable compared to the wondrous images this magic film offers.",Treasure Planet

137,IDanceWithFishes,"A emotional ride, much more then your average Disney Film",9,22 May 2006,"This film really got me where it hurt. The animation was wonderful, and I loved the way that they combined computer graphics and animation while creating John Silver, who was one of the best, and complex characters I have ever seen in Disney. The growing relationship with Jim and Silver was the highlight of the film and wasn't too sappy. The hug scene to me was a bit pulling at the old heart strings. I personally loved it and it has wiggled its way into my top 5 favourite Disney films. The humour was well done, but Captain Amelia stole the show along with Silver, with her sparkling vocab and Emma Thompson's lovely British accent! Jim is my favourite Disney hero seeing as he is portrayed in a very realistic fashion, as the rebel who is really, just a lost little boy.The Robot is....annoying, yet he does have his moments. Morph is sweet, never being too cutesy. However, Silver is the real highlight.He is first introduced to us as a charming, if slightly swarmy cook who cracks somewhat bad jokes. Later on, we really start to see his dark side...and it scared me. Really. The Jim/Silver moments were the best along with the top notch soundtrack, and Bill Murry as Silver!",Treasure Planet

And the ultimate disappointment is that such fodder has been more successful than Disney's experimental movies, such as Treasure Planet and The Emperor's New Groove.The movie updates the timeless tale of Treasure Island so well...all of the trademark scenes are there, yet in a very fresh world which has been carefully and wonderfully created, with lush backdrops and visually dazzling sequences - the way the action was captured, the experimentation with the camera, was especially refreshing. Even the story is a fresh departure from the typical Disney plot. Mr Silver is easily the best villain since Yzma, but for very different reasons. While Yzma was a parody of the typical villain, Mr Silver is a more indepth villain, with more complexities and (gasp) - an admiration for the hero.The voice acting was excellent, tip-top performances by Emma Thompson, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brian Murray, Martin Short and David Hyde-Pierce, along with the rest.

141,Savvas Stavrou,Heart-warming and Unique,10,23 April 2003,"I hate to see other people writing bad things about movies they don't like. Why write them at all? Why bother? The only reason people should comment about movies is to inform others how good the movie is. Now, to get to my point, why does everybody trash this film so much. Is it because it's a cartoon? Or is it because these people think that Disney acquired their ideas from video games and other forms of entertainment. Well, yes. Maybe they did get some of their ideas from that stupid video game but this doesn't stop them from making a good movie. All of Disney's movies are so original and unique, especially the Classic ones. How can someone even trash the classic movies? It's unacceptable! And no. I don't agree with Disney making sequels to the classics but that's how it is. They need money. The poor company's movies gets lowered down by second class movies like 'Ice Age' and 'Jimmy Neutron'. Now, to make my point. This movie has been so badly criticized and has been a bomb at the Box Office for no apparent reason. It was a funny, clever and quite sad movie. I actually admit that tears came to my eyes between the loving moments of the characters. Now that is a movie. I mean not even movies like 'Gladiator' make me cry. This was something special. I can also say that I would put it in the same category as 'Spirited Away'. That was also a brilliant movie. The story is very easily explained by the rendering of the wonderful 'Treasure Island' story into a futuristic animated classic. The scenes that mostly captured me where the ones when our hero - Jim (played by the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - came into a special friendship with a kind of father figure that he never had. Disney actually shows us the scene when Jim's father leaves him and his mother. This is something they have never done before and it is quite successful (it brought tears to my eyes).The rest of the cast was also very talented and funny. Especially the cat-like female captain. A surprise really to see females as heroes in a cartoon. I think Disney is trying to increase the female heroes in their cartoons to raise up the young girls' spirits. I can admit that I'm quite fed up with seeing male heroes all over the place.David Hyde Pierce was very successful as Doctor Doppler. He was quite funny actually and sometimes revealed a father-like attitude around Jim which added to the whole atmosphere. Morph, that little bubbly thing was incredibly cute. I found myself awing its greatness quite often throughout the movie.Overall, this was one of those brilliant Disney classics like 'Lilo & Stitch' that make you feel their warmth when you go home and think about them. The animation was excellent - the first time you see 3D landscapes mixed so well with classic Disney animation. I would recommend this over those stupid and cliché cartoon movies like 'Ice Age' and 'Jimmy Neutron'. This is definitely a classic amongst cartoons and sits on the same shelf as 'Spirited Away' in my mind. I just can't wait for the DVD. Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - An easy one.",Treasure Planet

Morph, the ""thing"", is really very funny and saves itself the film from the disaster. Long John Silver is very kind (should he ?), as the doctor is an interesting character. The crew, coming directly from Star Wars (or from the french comic ""Valerian""), is a catalog of strange creatures.

147,JustAnEpicPerson,Could of been better. LOTS BETTER.,5,16 June 2013,"So Treasure Planet, I never watched the trailer, but two things got me wanting to see it. The awesome song, ''I'm Still Here'', and that epic poster, which you can see on IMDb. The movie starts with Jim, our main character, but as a baby. He is reading a virtual book about pirates and robots and alien crap. His mom comes in to tell him to go to sleep, but instead he keeps reading. We fast forward so and so amount of years later to see him riding a... Do-Hickey thing. I don't know, it's a flying sail. He then comes back home because he was going past the speed limit, and the cops got him. He is grounded for a while until he sees a dieing alien robot. Cudos for whoever made the aliens, some of them look good, but some of them look like poop. He gives Jim this ball and mentions a cyborg. He comes home and realizes the ball shows a virtual map of the lost planet, otherwise known as Treasure Planet. Jim and Dr. Doppler go on this ship which sails to Treasure Planet. Now, for sure, the film DOES setup a cool plot.BUT.When we get on this ship, a lot of characters are met. Joseph Gordon- Levitt does a great job at voice acting Jim. David Hyde Pierce does a good job at Dr. Doppler as well. But I wanna say those were the only two good characters, as we meet so many that I can't even count them. We meet Captain Amelia (yes, the captain is a chick) who does a good job and is not annoying like most of the cast. Mr. Arrow is the assistant captain, but this role didn't need to be made in the movie. He was just there. And we meet a cool looking creature named Morph, who can transform into a mini version of anything. We also meet John Silver, who is just plain boring. But what it gets worse. The most annoying character in this movie?B.E.NB.E.N is a robot, who we have to find his brain in order for him to be smart again. Not only is this character ANNOYING AS HELL, but he actually causes a lot of problems in the movie thanks to his annoyances. And also, there is some AWESOME visuals in this movie. If you want a movie that shows off your blu-ray technology, this movie is perfect.OVERALL: 5/10, The movie sets a cool plot, and the HD visuals are awesome, but the annoying characters give it a big push back.

150,nickarsenev,"Sadly, not as good as could have been.",4,13 October 2019,"I used to watch this film as a kid and so I decided to take a look at it again for the purpose of nostalgia. It was a disappointment. As a little kid I didn't mind the wacky and dispensable characters (such as Captain Amelia and this Ben robot or whatever his name is). As a kid I didn't pay any attention to the deep canvas animation mixed with 2D & CG, which must've looked great at the time but certainly hasn't aged well. The humor of Treasure Planet which mostly comes from characters like Dr. Doppler and Cpt. Amelia was probably enough to make a 5-year-old me laugh (by the way I don't how or why they got together towards the end of the film, that is one of the weirdest storyline decisions and very creepy).
All of that hasn't aged well, certainly. There are a lot of great animated films which are both amusing for children and engaging for adults and teenagers. Disney's catalog is huge. But Treasure Planet is not one of them, it is a mess.
Just when you get used to the weird eclectic animation, just when you really get into the atmosphere and start to remember how it all was in the original Stevenson's novel, - this pop-rock song comes up, so you have to listen to that while Jim is doing his shipboy duties. And as far as I remember it is the only song in this film, not counting the one during the credits. Don't know why they needed a song in this film so much.
I genuinely don't understand a lot of the decisions made by the filmmakers. This concept is very great and promising, it's a shame that the execution wasn't that good, imho.

I loved the clever adaptation of tresure island with little star wars-y touches(btw, this movie is ten times better than episodes I and II). i loved Morph! I also loved the music. what else can I say? it was great!",Treasure Planet
152,IceaFrost,Best animation from Disney in many years,7,26 February 2003,"I went to see this movie with some expectations, but I thought that I´d be let down. I was wrong. I haven´t seen this kind of great animation since Disney released ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" while back in 1996. The adaption was great, the voices and character-design wonderful and a fitting score throughout the movie. Though I wouldn´t take small children to this, since the pirates look a bit ""scary"" with their 6 eyes, and weird looks.This is by far one of the best animated movies Disney has made in several years, I felt like they´ve gone back to the ""golden era"" (""The Little Mermaid and ""Beauty and the Beast"").Though this might be a pretty violent film, the whole story was wonderful and definitely a movie to watch.",Treasure Planet
153,blueleo65,I loved It!!!,8,11 December 2002,"I just watched Treasure Island, and I loved it!!!I think it's a serious attempt on Disney's part to offer an animated feature that adults can apreciate.The animation is spectacular, the action is great, but the reason I liked it so much is the relationship between Hawkins and Silver. It's a deeper and more complex relationship than I've seen in any other Disney animated movie. I loved the fact that they showed Silver""s human side. Even though Silver is a shady character, somehow him and Hawkins connect. I also respect the fact that Disney didn't change Silver into an Angel so that we accept his positive connection with Hawkins, he stayed just as crooked at the end as the begining.What is disapointing me about Disney is the fact that they are doing a terrible job of marketing this movie. There is no reason why this movie can't be the blockbuster that it should be. The fact that I didn't even know this movie existed until a few weeks ago, or that I haven't heard any buzz about it, makes me think something is just not right. Someone at Disney doesn't want this to be a hit. Heck, I haven't even seen it advertised anywhere (even though, I think it's a gorgeous movie poster).
Shame on you Disney marketing!!!",Treasure Planet
154,ahmetsena,So good.,6,3 May 2003,"I always like the Walt Disney movies and cartoons since I was a child. So, this movie is a bit familiar for me, and i thought that all Walt Disney fans will think like that after they see the movie. If we talk about the movie particularly, we could mention especially ""Morph""; was a well thought character. It is cute. The other think which is worth to mention about is the fiction of events in whole movie. To sum up; I'll suggest this movie to the people who are looking for fun and entertain. My Vote for this movie is 6 out of 10.",Treasure Planet
155,SabeAmidala,"They might have grabbed their artistic license and ran for it, but they won the marathon!",10,4 December 2002,"I am a ""Treasure Island"" freak.  In my opinion, it is one of the greatest books ever written.  I am also a sci-fi freak. So when I saw the preview for this movie, I knew I had to see.  Given, my love of Disney animation has not blinded me that they've recently been going-down hall (though they've picked up in the past couple years) so I was prepared to accept that this might not be the greatest movie ever made.How very wrong I was.  This is seriously the best Disney movie I've seen in years.Like I said above, Disney took advantage of artistic license.  But like another reviewer said, they followed Robert Lewis Stevenson's original plot to the best of their ability with this sci-fi twist and with still remaining typically Disney.  What an awesome blend. The result was a very good story. Being a lover of the book, I was sad that Blind Pew and the Black Spot weren't that included, but I understand the time thing.  There was also this thing with combining characters (The Dr. Doppler in this movie was actually a combination of Stevenson's Trelawney and Gray) but it made for a fun character, and it can be hard to work with too many.  Doing Ben Gunn as a robot was also a clever twist.  I also liked the little bit of romance. It was just cute and didn't get in the way of anything.  All in all, Disney made good use of artistic license in this. Very good use.What I really liked was the focus on the relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver.  It was interesting to watch it develop. It's one of the best character relationships Disney has ever done!Now for the technical stuff:  This is incredible animation here.  Even if, for some strange reason, you hate the story, just watch the animation. It really is a movie that's beautiful to watch.  The soundtrack is wonderful as well and fits everything perfectly.This movie has something for everyone: humor, danger, romance, tear-jerking stuff, big explosions, etc.  This show proves that Disney is regaining its edge, and demonstrates this gem that has to be one of Disney's finest.",Treasure Planet
156,DocRedfield,Disney's visually stunning foray into high adventure,9,7 December 2002,"Disney's latest animated feature is whole-hearted fun and adventure.  When are people going to remember that animation has always been around to do what can't be done in real life, and not always just a comedy...  I loved Lilo & Stitch, but I loved Atlantis too, and I think this flick has 'em both beat, visually and on an entertainment scale.  So its not 'Shrek' (and thank God for that), or 'Beauty and the Beast'; its FUN! Fun fun fun... The character designs are great, especially Silver, and the excess of 'Treasure Planet's' universe are breathtaking.  This is what animation is all about, so much more than just another computer generated comedy, but the modern mix of stunning CG with hand-crafted beautiful animation in the form of a scifi, if not wholly original (but what is, these days?), retelling of the Stevenson classic.  Get off your high-horses, grab the whole family from ages 10 to 100 and go see what a real, non-stop animated adventure is all about.",Treasure Planet
157,todd-246,Best Disney movie you've never seen,10,7 January 2005,"Before I begin, I just want anybody reading this to know that while I appreciate and understand the remarkable skill involved in the creation of and the historical significance of classic Disney films, I am not a very big fan of them. Having said that, you can put what I write into perspective.When I first saw this movie I had no idea what to expect. Wow! What a pleasant surprise. This is the best animated Disney film I have ever seen (yes, that includes Aladdin). Visually, it's a beautiful mix of standard 2D animation and 3D CGI. This works perfectly. Sometimes 3D CGI imagery can be distracting in an otherwise 2D animated film, especially when it is a bit herky-jerky (Titan AE is a good example). The two styles mesh well in Treasure Planet and I can think of only one scene, that takes place in the bowels of a ship toward the end of the film, where the CGI is a little distracting. Good character designs and beautiful starscape and ship designs presented in vibrant and rich colors with remarkable crispness round out the visuals. The animation is silky smooth, which is expected of a Disney film.The story is, of course, based on Treasure Island. However, the Disney team's update deserves recognition, not just for the well infused science fiction elements but for the well-paced humor they injected into it. David Hyde-Pierce's delivery, and his character (Doppler), really steal the show. He does not have the annoyingly obnoxious and overbearing presence of Robin Williams's genie. Of all the characters, his has gotten the most attention from the animators. Just watch him throughout the film, his mannerisms and expressions are part of the reason he's my favorite part of the movie. Even the musical bits of this film didn't turn me off, probably because there were only one or two.While being mostly about the character development of Jim Hawkins from an immature boy to a man and his relationship/conflict with John Silver, the film avoids being sickeningly sweet or cute. For the most part, Disney managed to keep it under control this time. If you liked the Iron Giant, this is in a similar league.",Treasure Planet
158,TuGLOiFE,Everything you could ask for in a fascinating display of Adventure,8,12 May 2003,"Let's see the movie itself, is quite extraordinary.

You will enjoy it!",Treasure Planet
159,etherwinter,A Fantastic Animated movie,10,17 November 2009,"This is one of Disney's last great hand-drawn animated movies and boy does it not disappoint. Sure it failed terribly in the box office. But so did movies like Shawshank Redemption. That just means people didn't know what there were missing. The Good: In this take on Treasure Island, instead of adventures on the sea the story takes to the sky. High in the sky and to the outer reached of a distant galaxy full wonderful scenery and imagination. Never before have I seen such fluidity and dimension in character animation. The shading, the perspective, the movement. Everything is nearly flawless in a refreshing combination of sci-fi/retro futurism and fantasy. The Not so Good: Well to me this is actually a +, but this Disney flick had no musical number like its previous ones. The reason it is a - in the long run, is that it kinda looses its magic that the lush and wonderful flicks from the 90s had. The bad: As beautifully animated as the characters may be, 80% of the background were not. At times it looked to much like a video game. The technique is called Deep canvas in which is meant to make CG look like painted background, but instead made it kinda less painted looking. All in all This movie is a great flick to watch if your in the mood for the art of animation at its best.",Treasure Planet
160,luv0817,Great Film!!!,10,16 May 2005,"I LOVE this film. Treasure Planet, was not appreciated enough by the critics and movie-goers. It is one of those Disney films that I believe will be a hidden treasure found in years to come. Maybe being a college student, still trying to find my own place is the world is why this film is so appealing to me. But, moreover- it's a universal feeling. It's something we all strive for; ""finding are place"". From the acting (I LOVE EMMA... I knew it was her the moment I heard her voice) to visual art with whimsical creatures and enough action/adventure to keep you alert, this film is a true treasure in itself.",Treasure Planet

I saw this in the cinema and it made for a very uplifting experience. After being swamped with films with big visuals but no characters or plot this was a breath of fresh air. These are Disney characters as they used to be, with plenty of personality but the visuals are bang up to date with a good mix of hand drawn and CGI. I read a post on the IMDb boards saying how it suffered from a management battle within Disney but the poster opined that Walt would have liked it and I have to agree",Treasure Planet
162,spindly,Underrated excellent film,8,5 June 2010,"I am shocked by some reviewers proclaiming this ""the worst"" of Disney's lot. Really? Were we watching the same film?The animation, to begin with, was rather breathtaking in scope and imagination. There were appealing and interesting character designs; the central character I felt might have benefited from being less ""bland"", but others such as Silver managed to be appealing yet carry an air of the gruesome which was needed for what he was supposed to represent; as a believable villain, essentially. Also the character of Morph was cute and served the plot in some way. For that, he wasn't the usual annoying Disney sidekick fare. Emma Thompson and David Hyde Pierce also stood out to me; their relationship was entertaining and believable if somewhat predictable!It was also a nice change of direction for Disney; a redeemable villain with no clear black or white sides, or a needed love interest to tie things up at the end. I think the strong point was the relationship that developed so well between Silver and Hawkins. Maybe it just doesn't touch some people, depending on your own personal experiences, but for me this was the heart of the film and made up for weaker points.There were a few; including Ben the robot. He was pretty annoying and seemed to arrive too late in the game, although he had some moments. I also felt like the film ebbed a bit toward the end, but then the climax made up for that.Honestly I don't have too many complaints to make about this film. So do yourself a favour and watch it!",Treasure Planet

164,runningman-87959,20 days of Disney #1: Treasure Planet,7,22 March 2018,"Before I get started, I just want to clear what 20 days of Disney is. For the next 20 days I will review 1 Disney film. And yes, that sounds exactly like Channel Awesome's DisneyCember. I will admit, I am exactly ripping that off. But I'm putting my own twist, where I don't go in order. I just choose randomly. Also, I will NEVER give any spoilers. Anyway, here's the review:Treasure planet is defiantly a different film from Disney's past films. For one, it's very modern from others. Where something like Romeo + Juliet (1996) was a modern version of Romeo and Juliet, Treasure Planet is a modern spin on Treasure Island. In some respects, it works. In others? Well... let's look at the story. Jim Hawkins is a boy who, unlike in Treasure Island, is a delinquent. His dad left when he was young. Yes, a father figure left the protagonist early in Disney Film. I don't understand either, but let's move on. One day he finds a map shaped like a sphere that leads to Treasure Isla- Planet! I keep forgetting this is Treasure Planet. He is joined by Doctor Doppler, some friend of his mothers, and is later joined by a whole gang of different characters, including Long John Silver, who is actually a Cyborg in this film. He is also joined by a robot played by Martin Short. That sentence make me love him already. I freakin LOVE Martin Short. So, for the story, in my opinion, even if it's a little different from the original source, it's still a good story. The characters: Jim is sort of a typical Teenager who want to be cool, and blah blah. Silver, I kind of liked. He's played by Brian Murray, and he's actually kind of funny in this film. And to be honest, Martin Short robot was probably my favorite part. So obviously I like this film. Perfect? MMMMMMM. No. For one thing, it's WAY to modern. Instead of a pirate, long John silver is a cyborg... eh. The ships suddenly can fly... wait what? Yeah, so all in all. I like it. It's problems can be annoying, but all in all, it is a film I can definitely recommend.",Treasure Planet
165,alicenual,A shamefully ignored gem of animated cinema,10,22 November 2020,"This film is a marvel on every front!
From a storytelling perspective, this movie captures you and takes you on an amazing adventure that doesn't lack emotion.
The charters are complex and very well written and their characterization is only enhanced by great acting. Even the villain, which in most Disney movies is the character that lacks dept and intricacies, is in Treasure Planet an example of what a great villain is.
Then you have the animation which is a seamless combination of different techniques the with the amazing character designs and the world's blend of old and futuristic designs, makes for a unique feast for the eyes.
The film's beautiful soundtrack by James Newton Howard sets the stage for the emotional journey of the movie and the tracks by Johnny Rzeznik give the an extra storytelling layer.
An amazing movie all around that honestly was doomed by Disney, even before it came out, with a purposely awful publicity campaign.",Treasure Planet
166,midnitesun9,"Finally, Disney gets a 'action' animated film right",10,25 November 2002,"I got extremly lucky and got to see a sneak peak of this movie for free last weekend, and I would have payed to see it. After Alantis (which, to me a disney freak since the womb, was a little disappointed with) i almost lost faith in Disney to be able to produce a good action animated movie. They proved me wrong.I'm assuming that they followed the Treasure Island plot line good (my only comparsion is the Muppets Treasure Island. The book has been on my to read list for years) so I won't go into the plot, except it takes place in a future space like envirnment (note the Plant in the title instead of Island). There's also clearly some Star Wars influence in it.However the voice talents. B.E.N. is hilarous (such a shame he isn't in the first half), and me and the other 2 people i went to see this with couldn't place the voice, is voiced by Martin Short, who lets face it, is one of the masters at funny voices. Brian Murry is a ideal voice for Long John Silver, and his side kick, Morph, provides most of the comedy. And David Hyde Pierce, never gonna be able to watch him again without picturing Dilbert. Emma Thompson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out the rest of the main cast nicely.The music is also great. Johnny Rzeznik (of The Goo-Goo Dolls fame) adds a 'younger' feel to the music, and he also wrote the lyrics to the 2 songs. The rest of the music is great. And BBMAk on the soundtrack is a nice touch to also attract the 'teen' crowd.Overrall, another great Disney movie, I fully enjoyed it.4 and a half out of 5 stars.",Treasure Planet
167,ErwinHarnoko,Failed to match Japan Animation,7,2 December 2002,"I believe this movie is trying to look like Japan Animation. It has been said that Disney animators now adore Japanese Master such as Hayao Miyazaki. And I have to admit, ""Treasure Planet"" creator did a marvelous job to adapt this 18th century story to ""Star Trek""'s century (whatever you name it). The image of the ship flying in the sky is spectacular.But all the spectacular that the movie bring to screen is still no match for Japan Animation (""Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis"" and ""Princess Mononoke"", for example). And I find the story not exciting either.I believe that Disney should back to its core competence, which is musical animation. I believe that Disney should give the audience another feature like ""The Little Mermaids"", ""Alladin"", and ""Pocahontas"", rather than space-wanna-be movie like ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" and ""Treasure Planet"".",Treasure Planet

Just to start of at the basics, I have to say I really love all characters and the way they talk, move and ARE. The combination of computer and animations works out very well in most scenes. Especially the one in which Long John Silver prepares dinner in the galley is great. All the movements just fit. The story doesn't resemble Treasure Island as closely as most people might want, but hey, it's in SPACE and in the future. How could it possibly be like the mid 18th century? Furthermore I think the whole plot is wonderful and touching. Especially Jim's bond with Silver is very well shown. But... The thing that REALLY caught my imagination was the solar-surfing. The movements and the way it resembles surfing or snowboarding got me to 'woo-hoo' the same way Jim did. Great! The sound-track by John Rzeznik was super and all other music just gave the movie that final touch...! Still, that isn't the reason why I love it so much.

This movie proves that ""Lilo & Stitch"" was not just a one-time thing.This is one of Disney's finest achievements.  I don't have much time, so here's a quick list of why it is wonderful:-Great storyline.  It stayed true to the spirit of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic. -Great complex charaters. -Beautiful animation. -Great soundtrack. -Plenty of humor and excitement. -Plenty of heart.Thank-you, Disney.

How often do you see a dog-like creature and a cat-like creature fall in love? Okay, that was kinda cheesy, but it was funny. I was 13 when I saw this, so I identified strongly with Jim Hawkins. The big question here is why does John Rzeznik write his best music for movies? ""Iris"" and ""I'm Still Here"" were great. Captain Flint could Scare you, and you liked Silver even though he was the villain. It was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to ""Spirited Away"", aka that Japanese flick nobody ever heard of or saw.

Instead of the magical classics that the company used to give us, they have turned to more modern stories that are lacking at best and characters that fail to stand up to some of the past Diasney heroes. Treasure Planet however broke the trend of dare I say, terrible, Disney movies that we have seen recently. The animation was gorgeous and the characters were surprisingly great, especially the robot Ben brilliantly played by Martin Short. But possibly the best thing about Treasure Planet was the way it managed to adopt a classic story without destroying it, which many movies tend to do. However, fear that it might do this very thing may have driven away a large audience. If you enjoy animation, or are looking for a good movie in general, this one is for you!",Treasure Planet

Willingly, I went: I like Disney movies, and I want to be an artist or animator when I get older.  However, this was just the worst thing I've seen by Disney!The movie's animation was nothing new.  The CG effects were somewhat annoying and clashed with the usual animation.  The storyline was boring but maybe because of the fact that it was based of ""Treasure Island"", and everyone's heard that tale before.  The otherworldly setting added nothing to the plot, other than the island is now a planet.  Wow.I wish Disney would put a better score to their films, as well; the music is never clever, simply predictable.  The song with the lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls was all right.The cast of characters, though voiced by a star-studded cast, was the usual lot.... the two characters hooking up at the end was also predictable and I saw it coming before the film did.  And Disney had to lower itself (or are they low enough already?) to put in a character that speaks in -- what else? -- farting noises.This film blew in, blew out, and left me with nothing except a yawn...

(That might have been a spoiler thats why I checked Spoiler) I also Loved the Music, it was amazing. The greatness in the whole film was flawless. The song ""I'm still here"" by the goo goo dolls was spectacular. I could not find anything about this whole film that did not make me smile, with the voices fitting the characters perfectly, and the amzaing graphics! This was a amazing film by Disney. It would make Robert Louis Stevenson proud, especially for the name of the ship the RLS Legicy; or the Robert Louis Stevenson Legicy. You could really feel Jims struggle, and Silver's emotions.

Fortunately the movie surprised me by being actually quite well made at moments very funny. No, it's not a Disney classic but I can't even remotely call this a bad movie, in fact I loved it!And to all the people pointing out the physical ""impossibilities"" like oxygen in space and strange gravity I would suggest that you watch the movie again and listen _carefully_ to the first part of the movie.

This did exactly that and a whole lot more.Everything about the film seemed to have been created with so much thought and detail, not a single element was put into the film without its own justice. This is a stunning look at the genre and personally I believe that Disney and everyone else have overlooked this film.The voice acting from everyone is great, animation looks crisp even compared to nowadays standards and overall i couldn't help but crack a smile every time Long John Silver was on the screen. There is enough meaning and thought to entertain the older half of the family and enough childish comedy to keep the children happy.Truly a overlooked piece of art.**** / *****",Treasure Planet

When it recently came on Pay Per View, I decided to sit down and watch and I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie actually was.  My 3 year old son is addicted to it and this is a movie that I really dont' mind watching time after time.  The music is really good too (Goo Goo Dolls has a great song that I believe was in the top 15 at one point).This isn't a typical Disney movie where there is a princess and a love story and all that mushy stuff...

Especially Amelia, she is my favorite of them all. But not because she is able to command these rough pirate guys (in fact she isn't.

192,Ottawan,Not the best from Disney,3,20 January 2011,"I've watched Disney movies since I was a child. There have been so many memorable ones, ones that I have watched over and over again to this date. I've enjoyed many as a young child, and enjoyed them as a teenager, and then again as a grown up. I have never written a review about a movie - this happens to be my first one. I felt it my duty, after reading so many positive reviews about this movie to put something down. This is one movie that I do not intend to ever watch again. So after reading so many positive reviews (nd some bad ones) I decided to put in my 2 cents. There is nothing memorable about the story, nor of the characters. It's rare to find such a terrible Disney movie, this is one of the rare ones. I was terribly disappointed by this movie. I've rented Disney movies or watched them in the movie theatre. If I like them (and I like most of them), I purchased a copy of the VHS tape years ago, and now the DVD or blu-ray. This is one movie I would not waste my money on. I have given it a 3 out of ten just because of the music in the movie. Other than that, avoid this one if you can.",Treasure Planet
193,blueraptor77,Worth more than the credit everyone gives it...,8,19 September 2005,"Upfront, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie beyond what I thought I would take from it. Being an animation major I can thoroughly pick apart most movies, especially what Disney puts out now-a-days. Unfortunately for their movie Treasure Planet, either it was ahead of itself ambitiously, or it was rumors that spread like wildfire (when it was being released) that killed it. Actually, that's why I didn't see this film until very recently, because of everyone's (and mine at the time) prejudice against Disney features springing up amongst way too many viewers, and especially for this film. I believed them that this film was terrible, and subsequently never got to see it until a week ago. Man, everyone was wrong.I'll be honest, and give it its weak points: The main character (Jim) is quite blank and not very well developed. Which is bad because an audience cannot connect to a flat, central character. Secondly, the CG (although very well stylized) I think didn't mesh as well with the 2D animation as it should have. Other than that...you might pick apart a few other things about the movie (and no, the dialouge isn't that bad. it's a G rated movie...it's not supposed to be incredibly complex).Treasure Planet keeps pretty tight in line with the original classic, ""Treasure Island"", even when softening it down for a younger audience. I grew up with that story, and had no problem with the adaptation in Planet. Also, this film contains two masterfully animated characters, John Silver and Dr. Dilbert Doppler (animated by two masters, Glen Keane and Sergio Pablos, respectively). If you're an animation enthusiast, these two are gold to watch (especially the pencil tests in the special features on the DVD).This whole review is a little long-winded, but in closing, this movie is more than what was said of it. If anything dealt the killing blow in this movie failing at the box office, it was everyone's bad word for it. Not true. Please see for yourself!",Treasure Planet
194,Varekai,"Seriously, what were they thinking about?",3,23 January 2006,"In an second attempt of reaching a more mature audience, being the first one the very underrated ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"", comes from the hand of veteran directors John Musker and Ron Clements a new version of Robert Louis Stevenson's book ""Treasure Island"". But unlike Atlantis that had and entertaining story with fun characters, Treasure Planet is a very poor film.The movie is long and boring, and I mean boring to no end. The so called action sequences -very well animated, I must admit- don't help to activate the mood, they just keep you wondering ""When this it's going to end?"".The character of Jim Hawkins doesn't evolves from being a James Dean wannabe -and there's nothing worst than a wannabe- he completely lacks of the strength and the charisma that a main character supposedly has. Same goes for the character of John Silver, he's way too ambiguous, so much that you don't like but you don't dislike him, you just don't feel anything for him.When I heard who was directing this and how much they fought for this movie, I was very hopeful to see a good animated experience, but this was a complete deception -and it's weird considering that Musker and Clements had directed good movies like ""Beauty & Beast"" and ""Aladdin""-I'm just glad that I saw this not in the theaters but when I rented it.",Treasure Planet

196,eric1014153,Underrated and Forgotten,7,18 October 2020,"While this movie isn't as good as some of Disney's best animated lineups, it was definitely underrated and unfortunately so.The movie presents a lesson in the value of a fatherly figure, and develops the characters through the complex self clashing in doing what you want vs doing what is right.The side characters are in the story to help proceed everything, but honestly they lack the necessary connection and importance to make the viewer really care about them. The main character has some development at the beginning, but because the plot kicks off so quickly, it's just assumed we'll see his development throughout the rest of the movie. It's hard to care for the character at the beginning, but it's assumed we accept his perspective from the unfortunate events that happen to him early on.The antagonist honestly makes for the rest of the movie, and is definitely the best element to the story. His clash between his personal bond with the main character and his true intentions of stealing the treasure and the map for himself creates this back and forth play by play from the start to beginning. We hate him and like him at the same time. As a kid, it was hard for me to grasp this somewhat complex theme since it was so different than what I was used to. However, as an adult, I really found this to be the best part of the movie.The comical parts seemed to be a bit forced and slightly annoying. There were some good elements and bad elements to it. As the movie reached its climax, the robot on the last planet was cringy and annoying. Other than progressing the plot, his presence was completely unnecessary and took away from the movie as a whole. Major downside. The morph was obviously playing to the cuteness of the character, as well as the pseudo dues ex machina in a couple scenes. He benefited the story, but he also hurt it. For the sake of the movie being meant for kids, I am neutral to his role.Overall, the movie was well done and underrated. For a younger audience, it was probably less entertaining because the characters were boring overall. However, for a slightly more mature audience/adults, one can greatly appreciate the theme and morals of the story while appreciating the art and animation that went to create the movie for what it was.",Treasure Planet

It's a lot different than most Disney movies, especially since it's a different take on Treasure Island.The score is incredible, the animation is amazing and the story is wonderful.Jim Hawkins is a great protagonist, a rebellious teen who's father left him many years ago and wants to make things right by saving his mother's business. The relationship Jim has with John Silver is very unique. Silver becomes Jim's mentor and a father figure that Jim has been looking for; but while also being the bad guy at the same time.The only complaint I have with this movie is B.E.N. I thought he was a cool-looking character design wise, but his personality was really, really annoying. It might make the kids laugh, but to others, you can tell this character was just here for laughs and to give Jim a harder time in some scenes.The way they combined CGI, deep canvas and traditional animation together is fantastic.

202,jonricco-1,For Roy,8,1 February 2006,"Everyone show watch and buy this movie if for no other reason than to support Roy Disney against Michael Eisner!!This poor movie suffered from political mudslinging between these two. As ""Treasure Island"" was one of the Disney company's first and most successful live-action pictures, Roy had always been passionate about making an animated version. Eisner, ever Roy's opponent, was in charge of the advertising budget. So, when Treasure planet was released, without any typically ""Disney"" fanfare, it met with unsurprisingly small attendance.The day after it was released, Eisner held a press conference, declaring ""Treasure Planet"" a flop, and blaming it for Disney's poor 3rd quarter performance. Roy promptly quit the company his uncle and father had built.As far as the movie itself goes, the controversy robbed what I think is the finest example of a ""Disney"" movie since Mulan. The animation is spectacular, the vocal talents are superb, and Brian Murray is one of the greatest Long John Silvers I've ever heard.But beyond the technical qualities, ""Treasure Planet"" captures the spirit of Disney much better than recent Disney debacles (see Valiant, Chicken Little, Home on the Range).

Treasure Island has one of the most wonderful character relationships so much so even its theme has been carried to other films (On Golden Pond comes to mind). I have to say that Disney took a turn for the better when they gave Jim Hawkins a rougher beginning, he's more of a punk then I think he was ever meant to be. It makes his transformation under the care of Silver all the more interesting; I love the surrogate father/son relationship and Treasure Planet does an outstanding job bringing this across. As far as the setting goes, being the child of Star Wars that I am--I cannot complain. It sets it apart from the other, dare I say, less inventive versions of the novel. The only problems I had with the movie were the few references to pop culture. Those references (Dilbert dancing,...etc.) make for a slight wincing at first thought but then I think are outweighed by even the performance of Silver by Brian Murray on its own. The animation is beautiful and I enjoyed the slight hint of illustrator N.C. Wyeth in the background styles and colors.

There's not much I can (or am able to) add to the previous review regarding the technical aspects of Treasure Planet. But, let me tell you that coming from an educator's standpoint (middle school), this film is AWESOME. First and foremost, because the movie didn't do that well at the box office, you're not showing the kids something they've seen a bejillion times before. The excellent animation sequences really grab ahold of students, and they are definitely digging on the film and getting into the story. Then, if you've been working with your class reading the original ""Treasure Island,"" you can have the kids create any number of class discussions/activities - from how did they think the creators of Treasure Planet did updating the story (and should a classic work like Treasure Island be updated?), what would they do differently, etc. - OR - have them work in groups and create posters showing the differences and similarities between the original work and this one. Finally, the whole ""I'm Still Here"" sequence opens the door for soooo much class discussion, especially regarding family life, troubled youth, gangs, etc. Most people not involved with young people in middle school are shocked to find out that gangs are such a Real Issue that these kids have to deal with. The fact that Jim's dad is absent, that his mom works so hard and is a good woman but can't seem to get her son straight, that Jim is taken under the wing of Silver opens up SO MUCH discussion. Is Jim a bad person? Why does he want to form a connection to Silver? Is Silver entirely a bad person? etc. This movie probably wouldn't work very well for high schoolers, but you could most definitely show it to your 4th, 5th, 6th and even 7th graders, and get some really good discussion/essay work. I love the subtleties (for Disney, anyway) that are here. Disney did so well with this, and got so many things right - great story, great plot, nice nuances, beautiful animation - it's sad that it didn't do well when it was released, but it's NOT TOO LATE to introduce it to young people who should and need to see it.

Stevenson's book since high school, so the movie itself held a bit of interest for me, simply as a story. The movie deals a lot with cross generational themes as well as redemption - themes that never grow old and apply to any age.
Never a dull moment, the movie clips along at an exciting pace. I'm not a huge fan of songs in the middle of movies (Tarzan being the sole exception - I loved Phil Collins' songs in the movie.), but I didn't even notice the songs in this movie. I mean, they were there, but the action was interesting enough that they didn't take over the story. As opposed to the singing in Little Mermaid, where Ariel actually IS singing, in no place in Treasure Planet do any of the characters stop what they're doing so they can start cutting a rug and practice their Bing Crosby imitation.

218,TigrinAE,Amazing film - one of Disney's best and most inspiring,10,1 December 2002,"After reading through a lot of the reviews for Treasure Planet by so-called 'critics', I've found I'm thoroughly disgusted and enraged by some of the things said about this movie. Most of the negative reviews were written by people who slept through the movie or are biased towards old Treasure Island films - how could you take a review like that seriously? And to most, Disney is not worth much anymore, after the past few animated features such as Atlantis or Lilo & Stitch; really, no one is giving Disney a chance., though it is obvious they are trying. Though there was no hesitation to give the foreign film Spirited Away an A+ (I have seen all these movies, by the way, and actually know what I'm talking about). Now I feel like throwing my opinion into the fray.I have to admit I was very skeptical about Treasure Planet at first. When I first heard about it, I thought it was nothing but Disney's poor attempt at a Titan AE rip-off. though there are similarities, eventually I came to realize this isn't so. Since then I've been waiting anxiously for about six months for this movie, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed in the least. The movie is an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic Treasure Island, an adventure that has survived since the late 1800's. I read the book beforehand, and I have to say Treasure Planet is a daring and imaginative spin on an old classic, ingenious and perfectly executed. Four and a half years in the making, it captures all the spirit of Treasure Island and sets it in an entirely new universe; but a lot of the detail of the classic is kept, right down to Silver tugging Jim along by the shirt on route to the treasure (in the book, Silver's leading Jim along by a rope) or the scene during Jim's sea journey when he gets chased up the mast. The concept they thought up for the film was incredible and worked very well; everything was adapted according to a 70/30 concept, or 70% 18th century and 30% futuristic. from the clothing the characters wear to the designs of the ships and the architecture. While the movie employs some of the most astonishing visuals I've ever seen in an animated film (using a technique called deep canvas that looks like oil paintings and simulates light) as well as an excellent score (I purchased the soundtrack a week beforehand and it hasn't left my CD player) this is only part of what makes the film great. The character designs are all unique and interesting, and the characters themselves and complex and have a certain depth and relativity that far exceeds the excellent story and visuals.My favorite character in the film was probably Jim Hawkins. He of all the characters seems the most real and has the most depth of any of them; John Ripa did an outstanding job with Jim's facial expressions. You can look at Jim's face and tell what he's thinking; there's so much more going on than just standing there looking like a cartoon character. At points you can look into his eyes and not see the rebellious teen but the young boy from the beginning of the film, clutching a pop-up book and dreaming of pirates and legends. The change in Jim during the course of the film is inspiring; he starts off as a low-life convinced he's nothing but a `loser' without a future. He harbors a feeling of immense guilt and angst for not being able to reach the dock in time to stop his father from leaving him as a boy; he doesn't believe he tried hard enough to make his father love him. He hides in his over-sized jacket and clothing and glares out from his deep-set eyes. During the film Jim gains back a feeling of self-worth through Silver, convinced by the end he is someone worth loving. He loses the jacket and gains a glow like a `solar fire', as Silver describes it. The depth to Jim and the duplicitous character Silver is the highlight of the film; Silver is just like his book alter ego... you can never tell which side he's on, even in the end. Silver's mechanical lust for the treasure he has been searching for all his life becomes paralleled with his more soft, human attachment to Jim, which climaxes towards the end of the film when Silver's forced to choose between them.Overall, I think the film is light-years beyond some of the more recent films Disney has done; it should be the start of a new era of animation, not the end of it. The film is a rip-roaring 90 minute adventure that keeps you engaged and wishing it were just a bit longer. There's no dancing, singing characters, no annoying humor (most of the humor is supplied by Doctor Doppler and B.E.N. - though amusing it isn't overly done, like a Jar Jar Binks complex) and the script is done well, each character having a certain way of speech that defines their personality but doesn't seem corny. Being a bit of an animation buff and hoping to work in the field someday for 2D films like this, I found the animation very well done, fluid and realistic. Kids will love the sheer wonder of the universe Treasure Planet - flying ships, mountains of treasure, monstrous villains and chair-gripping chase scenes - while adults will be engaged by the tale of the characters and a certain nostalgia for these kinds of films more often. After seeing it I find I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I've done a repeat showing. and I'm hoping to see it again and again, for surely it will last that long. Which is a good thing, not bad.

219,jess7674,"This was a great film, except...",10,16 December 2002,"I thought this movie was done very well. The voice acting by Joseph Gordon-Levitt et. all was simply perfect.I only had two complaints:1. I think the plot had too many characters to really get to know any of them... Since it's not a long film, there isn't time to involve that many characters and get you to actually care about all of them...2. I think the combination of the 3D animation with the traditional 2d ""cartoon"" characters looked a little awkward in certain scenes. It's a really nice idea, adding the CGI effects, but it just didn't ""flow"" all that well with the cartoon characters...But I still loved it! I gave it 10/10.  The music was GREAT (both the song by John Rzeznick as well as the score), and it was an enjoyable experience that I would recommend to anyone! :)",Treasure Planet
220,angel7777,"Pretty dang good, despite the critics!",10,8 January 2003,"I've never been the one to listen to critics.  It's my opinion that matters. And in my opinion, this is a great movie.Maybe the idea of a space ""Treasure Planet"" isn't original.  But, hey, few things are in this world.  Still, it's an uncommon idea.  Anyway, Disney took it and made it their own.  Maybe there is no Robert Bowman, but this has the same sort of feel.The story is fun and action-packed for the munchkins, and as an adult, I can testify that there is an interesting plot with witty dialogue.  Especially from Captain Amelia, who, might I add, is a Disney heroine worthy of emulation by all the little girls out there.And the art. . .wow.  Maybe some don't like the mix of classic animation and CGI, but I found it a great idea that needs to be continued with.What I liked most was the little world Disney created for this movie. Contrary to popular belief, these ships were NOT floating through airless space.  I love the conversion of Stevenson's Montressor to an actual planet. Everything fits together delightfully.Thought ""Lilo & Stitch"" has to be the dearest Disney flick in years, ""Treausre Planet"" holds its own amongst all the bs Disney has been flinging out (i.e. ""Dinosaur"" and ""Atlantis"") It's certainly worth an open-minded viewing.My only sadness is that this never got the attention it deserves.",Treasure Planet

It had superb animation (in multiple styles), great voice work, a simple but sufficient plot, and no dull moments. And as a science fiction afficionado I was pleased to see some new concepts in the movie concerning space travel and such. I don't buy many videos, but I see myself owning this one some day. Sure it's a rewrite of an old classic with a big dollop of Disney plot-spackle mixed in, but this what it is: a big engaging safe-for-all-ages eye-candy spectacle.",Treasure Planet

Treasure planet is THE best movie that ever happened to this universe and some of you people just don't get it (including you Oscar people who voted for Spirited Away for best animated feature, that movie was garbage). Treasure Planet doesn't deserve the grade it got. It deserves a 10/10. It had a awesome plot, cool characters, and was just all around fantastic! Give it a chance and you'll find that it's a wonderful movie. And all you scientific people, WHO CARES IF THE MOVIE ISN'T ALL SCIENTIFICLY CORRECT!? If you went around saying that about the king of all movies, then I'd hate to hear you talk about Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings! If you don't get the point, here it is plain and simple: I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! give it a chance, and maybe you'll like it too. 10/10",Treasure Planet
224,galadrielsgirl17,Absolutely LOVED it!,10,24 August 2003,"This is one of the best films Disney has done in a while! It's not the same old Disney movie. It has a much better plot, character personalities, and a sweeter love story in my opinion(Whom they chose to put together was so sweet!) I'm 17, but I adored every minute of this film! When I first saw it commercialized, I wasn't interested. But I saw bits and pieces in places and was real interested. I watched first at my Aunt's on DVD and just ADORED every minute! It's definiately a ""watch tons of times""! The music is incredible(got the soundtrack as soon as I could), especially Jim's Theme performed by The Goo-Goo Dolls(I didn't know how good they were!). The 3D and 2D mix is just wonderful, Martin Short as B.E.N is simply hillarious, and David Pierce as Doctor Delbert Doppler is also. Emma Thompson is fun as Captain Amelia, Brian Murray as Long John Silver is very lovable, and Joseph Gordan Levitt is wonderful as Jim Hawkins(A pretty handsome boy for a cartoon, come to think of it =)). Last, but not least, Morph the pink blob is adorable and delightful and was a fav of mine at first site. The characters really were alive to me, for there was so much feeling in them all, especially Jim. You could really feel the hurt with Jim about not having a father, and I did cry at one point on that subject.=) Anyway, I loved it and I hope most who see it will too. A definiate exciting, delightful, and just plain great classic in my movies!",Treasure Planet

I watched this movie so many times as a kid and enjoyed every second! I showed all my friends and they all love it too! This movie is so wonderful!!Oh my goodness! I pity all who didn't love it! Treasure Planet is a heart warming story about a boy following his dream, this movie is filled with adventure and a good story too! All the characters are awesome and you love them all right from the beginning! At least I did! It's great for kids, but i think adults will love it too, It's got funny moments, sad moments, And AWESOME MUSIC!!! if you haven't seen it, I highly suggest it!!!!!

226,xAngelsFallx,A heart-warming story with spectacular animation...,10,13 October 2003,"I must admit, when I saw previews for Treasure Planet, my first thought was ""Oh great, Disney's making yet another attempt to cling to what they once had."" Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Disney, but most of their recent productions (mainly sequels) just completely lack the Disney magic we've all come to know and love.Then I decided to at least give Treasure Planet a chance. I was completely blown away. It's a heart-warming story with spectacular animation. It showed that Disney still had some magic left, not to mention creativity (solar surfing, Morph, a cyborg Silver... need I say more?)I was extremely impressed with the development of the characters. You can tell they really focused on how Jim would look and act. He flawlessly portrays the typical ""teenage outcast."" Not to mention John Rzeznik's ""I'm Still Here"" fits in perfectly as ""Jim's theme."" It's such an emotional part of the movie and it definitely needed an equally emotional song to match. It's a good thing Rzeznik is a musical genius.So why didn't this movie do well in theaters? For one thing, it just didn't get the advertisement it deserved. Plus, Disney's audience is usually children, but younger children can't comprehend Jim's feelings throughout the movie as well as teenagers can.Treasure Planet quite possibly has the best soundtrack I've heard in years. So if you don't plan on seeing the movie, at least try listening to the soundtrack. Although I should warn you, once you listen to ""I'm Still Here,"" you'll be dying to see the movie.",Treasure Planet
227,greeneosker1,Treasure Planet,10,30 January 2014,"I give this a 10 in hopes that they will do something more. There are so many ways you could go off the end. You could stay on Jim and the military or stay on Silver. I mean really, why couldn't you just make 4 or 5 years later as many times as u want. I really want to see one of the many directions that they could go. Most of the new watchers don't care about back story anymore. I really think in the next 5 to 10 years this movie will replace the idea of Robert Louis Stevenson. Which is not a good thing but it will allow for better entertainment for the meek. Which would also let the FCC put their nose somewhere else. Please make a squeal or two(2).",Treasure Planet
228,debhelmantx,A surprisingly GREAT movie for families!!,9,6 January 2013,"My boys are 5 and 7 and love the book Treasure Island. We watched the movie on Netflix and even my husband and I loved it! I had never heard of the movie and can only deduce that it's because it didn't do well in the box office. The ""steam punk"" nature of the movie, old times set in the future, was interesting and well done. I loved that it didn't have a sappy love story and it was about a boy proving to himself and to his mother that he could do whatever he set out to do. It was paced right to keep everyone intrigued until the very end. I also enjoyed the fact that everything wasn't black and white, there were truly ""bad"" guys and those that were ""bad"" but in the end turned out to be good. That grey area in between is sometimes hard to teach children. All in all, this movie was excellent and I would recommend to families. It's hard to find a movie that everyone enjoys but this was one of them! Watch it! It's amazing!!!",Treasure Planet

I remember hearing about this movie, but never had any interest in it.Watching it with my daughter today I was really surprised how much we both enjoyed it. the action scenes and music are top notch. The crazy, diverse aliens are really captivating - my daughter sat through the whole thing (not everything keeps her attention).The animation wasn't jarring at all, and really holds up well. The music/soundtrack really shines, there's really nothing I didn't like about it. This is a fun space adventure based on a classic, perfect for a Saturday matinee.",Treasure Planet

I hope others can enjoy this movie as much as I did because it's not a movie that would fail anyones expectations.I don't get why this movie was underrated, when the movies now are 1000 times worse. It was worth my time and I loved every second of it. I also love the soundtrack in it because it fit the movie really well and the songs were really catchy ( I even have them on my ipod) :).

The song just reminds me of certain scenes from the film and i can't help but say that this is my personal favorite Disney movie and it will take a lot to top it.",Treasure Planet

233,bjornhaakinen,One of the few Disney films that reach for epic greatness.,9,10 September 2007,"Hai. I just wanted to inform any last one of you that I've seen this film and I'm touched by it. It made me feel magic inside. Few films from Disney actually succeeded in doing that. Kuddo's to Disney.About the film: adventure, suspension and enough emotions so it wouldn't be another weak joke flick as almost every animated film these day - I'm point at Shrek the Third and the lot of squeezed out applications of formulas for ""funny"" animated movies. Pardon my possible lack of decent grammar/vocabulary, but in not-as-bright-as-I-wish-to-be moments I tend to only write fluently in my mother tongue - this being a harsh and direct translation of sentences formed in my mind in my default language.So anyway, I just saw this film, after I saw Emperor's New Groove - also from Disney - and I must say I liked this one much more. I had much more a feeling with this film that Disney tried to reach for greatness. This story pulled me into it, seriously. Maybe I was only momentarily prone to this kind of film - I'm saying that maybe it's just coincidence that I liked it, because if I saw it another time when I was feeling differently, maybe then I wouldn't have liked it the same way as I do now.My statement about this film: HIHGLY underrated and certainly not as successful as it deserves to be. Too bad Disney did a lousy job marketing this film. Drama, yes. Anyway, I can recommend it to anyone who likes an adventure in a very cool setting, and which tends to be more serious than funny. I loved it.",Treasure Planet
234,WUZZUP022,A fantastic job from Disney. A Movie for all ages that is sure to put a smile on your face.,10,28 July 2005,"OK, I'll tell you right now, I was not expecting this movie to be good at all. I watched it reluctantly after my Uncle had gotten it from some movie club and gave it to us. Me being a teenage guy laughed when he handed it to me. But my Dad really wanted to watch it, so I humored him by watching it with him. MAN! This movie is just...cool. Personally, I love the original Treasure Island. It was so much fun to watch it redone with a futuristic theme to it. This movie truly is for everybody. I must have watched it at least 10 times...at least.No one can complain about the story line, because it's the exact same famous story line of the original, just set in far off space. Not only are there cool gadgets and nifty ways of flying, but great messages to be had throughout the entire film. There are morals about friendship, love, sacrifice, etc. The voices match the characters perfectly, and in the end, it leaves you with a great feeling (not to mention the music is awesome).I highly recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to smile. There's action and drama and comedy and some funny looking aliens too. I give the movie a 10/10",Treasure Planet

There are two characters in the movie that were our favorites (one adorably cute and one funny). I don't want to say too much and give away the story and/or the characters. I can't wait to re-watch it with my 8-year-old grandson because I don't remember any bad language in it. Enjoy and God bless!

237,oskarsjolund,This style of animation is the s***!,10,10 March 2021,"First of. Disney's animations have become way too boring with everything looking round and circular. This more raw take with sharper edges and more defined lines makes for a more determined look and according to me feels more bold and intended. There are more movies that share this style and I personally like these Disney movies a lot as well but treasure planet is the best one out of these (example: Atlantis, Tarzan kind of, Pocahontas 2).The story is a variation of the famous treasure island with the cast also as variations of the original. I highly doubt that anyone who reads my review won't already have read about the story so I won't bore you with explaining it. I will however say that this take on a classic story really felt refreshing when this movie first came out. It is a good variety of keeping to the original as well as flipping everything around and making something different from it. Some parts are incredibly well made while there are some things that could have been dealt with better (a certain character who I don't remember the name of since someone stole my memory. Pun intended).Overall this is a fun adventure film that is suitable for all ages. It has a great character build that really lets you see deep into several of the characters and also understand their motives, it has a banger of a theme song performed by the lead singer of the goo goo dolls; John Rzeznik, it has beautiful animations, its played out in space and it's steampunkesk!What more could you ask?",Treasure Planet
238,GarrettWalt,"A Beautiful, Unparalleled Adventure with Real Weight",10,2 June 2015,"Treasure Planet is my favorite movie of all time. No, not my favorite Disney movie, or my favorite animated movie, or my favorite sci-fi movie - just favorite. Period.An inspired take on the classic Robert Louis Stevenson story, Treasure Planet follows young Jim Hawkins, an impetuous and directionless youth who stumbles upon a map to a hidden treasure. In order to claim it, Jim will have to traverse the galaxy with a host of supporting characters, and will have to face astonishing threats like black holes, fistfights, and mutinous pirates.Treasure Planet is a film where absolutely everyone - production designer, director, cinematographer, animators, writers - brought their ""A"" game. The visuals are vibrant and beautiful. The characters are interesting and generally well developed. The action is smooth and, in some cases, rivals the direction of live-action films (one sequence, a chase through the interior of a ship, stands out as an example of animation skillfully imitating a live action sequence, including the simulation of a moving, hand-held camera - something other animated films just can't match). Everything in this movie works, and, aside from some obvious pandering jokes, the movie is enjoyable for any age.The heart of the film is Jim's own conflicted nature and the self-doubt and self-destructive tendencies that he's been left with in the wake of being abandoned by his father. Unlike many Disney animated movies, there is real emotional weight to Jim, and the developing mentor relationship that he gains with Silver (essentially the film's villain) offers obvious parallels for those who've grown up with mixed feelings towards an absent parent. Silver works as a nuanced villain (in a Disney movie! can you believe it?!) whose own motivations are complex and who helps to both drive the conflict of the film and develop the character of Jim.Ultimately, Treasure Planet is a film with true imagination. It's a gorgeous, heartfelt adventure that just works on almost every level. I am biased - it's my favorite, after all - but I believe that Treasure Planet deserves a place among the pantheon of animated classics, and even rises above others as a mature sci-fi adventure in its own right.",Treasure Planet

240,m-anny,A great movie!,10,27 September 2005,"I am a teenager and go to a grammar school in Germany and when I want to watch a movie I am always very careful in choosing. But I know, that usually Disney films are very good and have a good to high standard. I first saw Treasure Planet in cinema and when I got out of the building I just thought something like ""That was fantastic!"". Well, I know that I sometimes behave a bit childish, but it is important for me, that the movie I'm watching has got a message and has a standard and Treasure Planet is a film like that. So everyone who likes pirates, space, adventure, speed, a young rebel and treasure hunt is right with this movie. I think that some people know the story Treasure Island from R.L.Stevenson. (A ship in the movie is named after him - R.L.S. Legacy) Traesure Planet is based on this story but it's much more exciting in the film. I would say, everyone can watch that movie, because it's funny, full of speed and adventures and not too cruel - but: You should not hate strange characters!",Treasure Planet

Highly underrated,10,23 December 2005,"When this film first came out, I was quite a bit skeptical, given what I thought was another lame Disney storyline like Atlantis, Emperor's New Groove and Mulan, and opted out of seeing it in theaters. Now 3 years later I was curious to see what it was all about, so I gave it a chance and rented it. To my surprise, I was blown away by the brilliant animation and complex storyline (going beyond the book), and wondered how this film could have been so overlooked. The coming of age story about a teenage boy deals with real issues in today's world, and how each of us has our own potential to reach. I also loved the score and the music by John Rzeznik. The only complaints I have is that Jim looks much older than his supposed age (15), perhaps 17 or so, and that the robot was obnoxious and shouldn't have been added in at the end.

It's been three years since the movie came out, and I'm still crazy about it. I've watched it over 300 times. It is truly wonderful and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes real honest to god animated movies. About the Disney's biggest flop thing, chill out people. That's no reason not to watch the movie. It's simply a mater of opinion. If you don't like the outer space theme, or whatever, then don't watch it.

248,Creeperbones,Wonderful movie,9,3 April 2006,"* - This review contains spoilers - *Okay. So we have our movie here, ""Treasure Planet"". Yes the name may sound a bit cheesy, and yes it is another adaptation of Treasure Island. A lot of people just can't get past those things and thus end up watching it with a far more criticizing eye then it should be viewed with. It's its own movie, even if it was created out of Robert Louis Stevenson's book. If you rent or buy the movie, just keep that in mind. Don't get caught up with scenes being played out incorrectly to the book or new characters added that shouldn't be there.I found the movie very enjoyable for many different reasons, but it's the characters that stood out most to me. They were each animated with, in my opinion, practically as much life as real people.There were no token villains like in the majority of Disney movies. The ""bad"" characters in this one were just people (and aliens) who had different motivation, namely greed for treasure. Though perhaps the spider creature Mr. Scroop might be an exception, but his story is pretty vague.Also one thing that was absent was the typical ""guy-and-girl"" relationship, where the main male and female characters fall in love over the course of the movie. Instead this happens to supporting characters. On the subject of relationships, I must definitely mention that the one between the main character Jim Hawkins and the cyborg John Silver was perhaps the most original one I've ever seen in an animated movie (or maybe also live action). Since Jim's father left he and his mother early in his life, he didn't grow up having much of a male mentor. On the journey that he eventually ends up in, Silver then came into the picture and accidentally became a type of unofficial surrogate father. Teaching Jim about the ships and keeping an eye out for him among the crew members. And yet at the same time Silver was also a sort of main villain, planning a mutiny on the ship and aiming to steal the riches from Flint's Trove. But still, he really did have a friendship with Jim, no matter how much he denied it to the crew. The mutiny did come about and Jim heavily interfered with his lifelong plans...but even when he had several opportunities to get rid of him and save the plans, he chose to let Jim live instead.I've never been a very articulate person in describing things, but anyone who's watched the film would understand what I'm trying to say about the originality of the characters. Words never do many things justice.Perhaps I'll recreate a better review if I end up with a way to explain myself more elegantly",Treasure Planet
249,fort_linkin_minor_park,A Treasure!,10,14 January 2007,"Treasure Planet is a Gem. Period. I keep hearing how this movie will never be part of Disneys ""Classics"" Well I like this movie more than some of Disney's so called ""Classics"" A great story, amazing animation, believable characters and relationships, great music that actually fits the movies atmosphere. This movie has so many amazing elements, that its flaws look so small compared to all the good this movie has to offer.The only reason Im not giving it a perfect score is, even though I adore this movie, I don't adore it as much as The Iron Giant, The Secret of NIMH, and The Little Mermaid, but this movie is still a Disney Gem that needs to be given much more credit that it has been given.I highly recommend it!

250,greatmumu6,Another score for Disney.,10,21 March 2006,"Let's put it this way, with no fan-girlish outbursts (Which is pretty hard). This movie has pretty much everything required of a superb movie.As is the case of most Disney movies, there is a light-hearted side and a serious side, but this movie is slightly more serious (my preference). This movie has so much heart and a lovable cast of characters. I don't think it was completely for teenage boys, it just centered around one with a situation that is sadly familiar with many of us.The atmosphere is such an imaginative one, who cares if you can't breathe in the vacuum of space? (The book from Disney explains that this is a kind of parallel universe.)Nebulae, galaxies, comets...they all are stunning with these 18th century ships. I personally think that most spaceships look rather alienating.The soundtrack may be drowned out at moments, but the times you hear it, it fits well. The song by The Goo Goo dolls' lead singer is perfect for Jim, and the sequence in the movie is more worth watching than the music video! And the story! I think the depth, connections and growth of the characters are certainly levels above Treasure Island, thanks to the Disney touch. (I really don't want to spoil anything.)Just buy it, if you haven't over the last three years.",Treasure Planet
