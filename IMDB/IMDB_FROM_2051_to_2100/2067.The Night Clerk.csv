0,nogodnomasters,Hey. How ya doin'?,6,27 February 2020,"Bart (Tye Sheridan) lives in his mother's (Helen Hunt) basement. He has Asperger's syndrome. He is semi-functional in society working as a night clerk at a hotel. He has cameras in a few rooms. He is not strictly a voyeur as he listens to them talk and parrots what they say as a treatment to become more functional. As fate would have it, he sees a murder and doesn't know the proper way to respond bringing suspicion on himself.I couldn't help think about ""Motherless Brooklyn"" or even ""The Accountant"" as Hollywood appears to have run out gum show types solving crimes. No bourbon, no cigarettes, no classy dames. Interesting film. Keeps you engaged.Guide: F-word. Near sex. Nudity (Ana de Armas)",The Night Clerk
1,kosmasp,Watching you,7,13 March 2021,"If someone told you they are not spying on you, they are recording you to study human behavior and use it as a lessons video, how to interact with other humans ... would you be anything else than creeped out? I kind of doubt it, but here we go.And these video recordings have something to tell. Something that our main protagonist would or could use. So you do have to suspend your disbelief from the get go. Our main character has his issues or ticks, which make him interesting to say the least. And then along comes Ana de Armas - well her character does. But this character like every other character she has played and I have seen her portray, also does not seem to have an issue with showing off her body. Now in this case there is actually a reason for her showing off. It is part of the story and her character and it is a brief moment.And while this is predictable (I don't think any of the twists will blow your mind), it is a nice little thriller/watch",The Night Clerk
2,Sleepin_Dragon,"A good story, boosted by incredibly good acting.",7,29 August 2020,"It's a very interesting story, which develops well. Bart is a fascinating character, who's motives for doing what he does are sincere and innocent in his own way, buy invasive and voyeuristic.The ending should have been so much better, if anything I thought it spoiled what was otherwise a very good film, the story builds and develops gradually, but the ending was harsh and abrupt.Always great to see Helen Hunt, but the star of the show is of course Tye Sheridan, who's performance is actually captivating, what an amazingly talented young man he is. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of him in the future.Boy oh boy this was good, 7/10.",The Night Clerk
3,classicsoncall,"""I think this person might be dead.""",7,22 June 2020,"I've seen Tye Sheridan in 2012's ""Mud"" and ""The Mountain"" from a couple years ago, but his presence never registered with me the way it did here. In the film, I couldn't tell whether he was an actor who actually had Asperger's Syndrome or if he was successfully portraying such a person. There's nothing in his bio information here on IMDb to suggest as much, so his performance is exceptionally well done; he must have really done his homework.As for the movie itself, I felt there was something just a little bit off about the screenplay. It would seem to me that regarding the circumstances of Karen's (Jacque Gray) murder in the hotel room, Bart Bromley (Sheridan) would have come under more suspicion as a suspect. His grilling by Detective Espada (John Leguizamo) was cursory at best given his proximity to the event and his questionable behavior on the night of the crime. Nor was it ever explained how Bart might have had the wherewithal to set up cameras in the hotel rooms to provide for his voyeuristic tendencies. Then there's the character of Andrea Rivera (Ana de Armas), was she simulating a reaction to Bart as a potential love interest, or was she exploiting him from the get go? There was no reason for her to express an interest in him, especially after he revealed his disorder, which even under the best circumstances did not mask his annoying behavior and manner of speech. That was just baffling to me.What was cleverly done was the way in which Nick (Johnathon Schaech) was revealed to be Karen's murderer, because if you were attentive enough, the same tattoo on his body appeared in the recordings of Nick with both Karen and Andrea. I also found it interesting that Bart did make a backup of the Karen murder tape even after he told Espada that he hadn't done so. It all led to the story's predictable conclusion, while leaving wide open Bart's fate following Nicks inevitable arrest. A little more thought put into the screenplay would have made this a much more compelling psychological thriller.",The Night Clerk
4,Calicodreamin,Slow as molasses,3,10 June 2020,"This storyline moved as slow as molasses in the middle of an ice age. The storyline wasn't very exciting and entirely anticlimactic. The characters were well cast and well acted, but lacked depth. Boring.",The Night Clerk
5,ops-52535,autismicly strange,6,21 February 2020,"Its a film about autism spectrum disorder, a young man with high but ever so locked up mental capasity, who has vast compications connecting to other åeople. working as the night clerk at a hotel, he feels that he can control and surveil the environment, and as part of his self therapy, uses hidden cameras in the hotel rooms, just to practice how to interact with people, especially the female part of the guests. but as a crime occurs on his night watch, things become very dire for him.its a strange study into the head of a complicated person. its kinda rainman feeling rendering you while watching, at the same time its not. there are some confussionin the plot, the characters are pretty undeveloped, and its hard to say what reaaly happened in the end..seems to me they were in a hurry to get an end to the story,it could have been much better....the grumpy old man gives a 6 for the main cast, its a small recommend, and a joyridee if youre in the trade of working peoples heads..",The Night Clerk
6,Floated2,Intriguing little thriller but a confusing ending,7,30 January 2021,"Having not heard of this film until deciding on watching. With no expectations or not knowing exactly the type of film it was (not watching any trailers either). Relatively a slow paced story but overall was intrigued with the story and fascinated by the character of Tye Sheridan (a young actor who continues to shine).The Night Clerk plays out like a mystery but doesn't provide many thrills or suspense as expected. It is more of a drama and occasional romance story.Ana De Armas plays the love interest and steals her scenes with given not too much but does what she's capable of. Her star power and ranking has most certainly risen within these last few years, and it is great to see as she deserves her success.Relatively predictable story telling but the ending felt quite rushed and that they could have possibly added about 10-15 minutes more to expand on the story.This film was less than 90 minutes of run time and it did feel short. It was entertaining for what its worth but there could have been more added.What we see in the ending was slightly confusing. At first it appears that it was all a dream but then when the male victim was spotted, it was shown to be the same guy whom killed the initial blonde woman.What was most confusing is in the final scene we see Tye Sheridan at a mall walking around (when it seemed as if he had shot himself- it was off screen where we just heard the gun shot). So apparently he did not shoot/kill himself but shot the gun to get the police to the house and he was somehow able to escape without being noticed.We then see a scene with Ana de Armas with the guy in the car and the police coming behind them. Overall it was slightly confusing and felt rushed as the recap was shown with flashbacks. Perhaps they could have paced it slower and showed it in a breakdown each step.Otherwise the film was relatively unique and intriguing all the way through. It's IMDB score is quite low for what the outcome was. Would recommend.",The Night Clerk
7,marmar-69780,the night clerk,3,29 February 2020,"The worsest thing about this film is that it had a nice beginning and solid story that could be interesting if it was done right,but unfortunetly it wasnt,ty sheridan and ana de armas did their best to save this film but except their good acting expecely from ana nothing was worthy remembering it,dialogue wasnt so good at all it has to lot staff going on in plot and everything just ended up being messy and weakly made,the rest of film isnt also worthy remembering it,i wish that more capable director made this film since i think that this idea was interesting enough to be told in a better ways and not just handed to a guy who rely on weak storytelling and messy plot points",The Night Clerk
8,jtindahouse,Works as a character study but that's about it,6,21 February 2020,"The problem with 'The Night Clerk', and I've seen many films fall into this trap, is that it gives itself a really annoying lead character for the audience to have to follow and side with. Now there are two sides to that coin. One is that the character is unique and interesting to watch from a medical point of view, and that's why the movie puts him there. But the other side of that coin is that it becomes really frustrating and hard to watch very quickly. It gives the film a point of difference, but a point of difference for the sake of it isn't always enough.Tye Sheridan does a fantastic job playing the lead role. He nails Aspergers syndrome. Before it was ever mentioned in the film I was 100% certain that was what I was looking at. He keeps it up for the entire movie and never drops a scene either. The other cast member who really impressed me was Ana de Armas. I came to learn of her acting talents in 'Knives Out' and she has impressed me again here. She didn't have anything overly special to do in the film, but you could still tell she was a class above the rest.The film itself is a little obvious in what it is trying to set up and surprise the audience with. There's one scene in particular that they thought they were being subtle with, but in reality it put all the cards on the table and gave the game away. Also there is a mystery element of sorts to the film that, had it been handled differently, could have been really interesting. Instead it was just clunky and petered out to dust by the end. I think the thing to watch this film for is Sheridan's performance and as a character study of an Aspergers syndrome. Otherwise there isn't a whole lot going for it.",The Night Clerk
9,DarkVulcan29,Tye Sheridan's performance makes the movie,9,15 July 2020,"I get The Night Clerk is trying fall into the category of lonely person thrillers, like Taxi
Driver(1976), One Hour Photo(2002) and Drive(2011), and in my opinion it does quite well for itself.
Bart(Tye Sheridan) a hotel clerk who works at night, and he has Asperger Syndrome, make him unable to relate to people on a emotional level, and has cameras in a certain room, so he can observe peoples behavior, and in hopes can relate, one night sees a murder in the room, and he quickly becomes a suspect. We wonder how Bart will make it through this?Sheridan really did his homework on Asperger, and it shows in his performance, he was so good it made me forget he was acting. John Leguizamo is also good has the nice guy detective, who does not want to believe that Bart was involved, but soon quickly has a change of thoughts, when two much evidence points to him. Helen Hunt is great has Bart's caring mother. Ana De Armas is awesome a sexy hotel guest who befriends Bart. The murder mystery part is also good, and just when you think you know how it's gonna end, well I don't want to give anything away.",The Night Clerk
10,kwenchow,Another worst film! Super freaking slow! The killing scene also never show to the audience! Bored to freaking death!,1,6 May 2020,"This film start with a hotel night clerk ""Bart"" talking to the video he recorded using hidden camera, and he try to save a girl from the killing of a serial killer ""Nick"", but fail scene! As turnout, this film is about Bart having Asperger syndrome, he like to record people to imitate them! And he eventually kill himself to expose Nick killing act! Entire film full of boring conversation, and super freaking slow! Make the film unwatchable! Not a single killing scene show to the audience! Barely watchable scene is, Bart accidentally saw Andrea naked at the swimming pool! At the end, Bart kill himself with a gun! A bunch of police chasing Nick's car! That's it! Wasting time to watch!",The Night Clerk
11,henry8-3,The Night Clerk,5,6 August 2020,"Sheridan plays a hotel clerk with Aspergers who secretly spies on hotel guests via specially positioned camera to understand and mimic their speech. He then witnesses a murder.Interestingly told thriller seen in part from the autistic viewpoint, the best scenes are the interplay between Sheridan and new guest de Armas who develop a relationship of sorts. The detective elements are a bit bewildering as Sheridan clearly knows more than he's saying and yet Leguizamo keeps his distance due to challenges from Sheridan's mother (Hunt - overly dramatic). Overall an interesting idea but only partially successful in its delivery.",The Night Clerk
12,yusufpiskin,Amazing performace ;Tye Sheridan & John Leguizamo,7,28 May 2020,"I thought it was an incredibly weird decision to have Tye Sheridan play this character. Literally everything Tye Sheridan does looks so cool. But man he delivered big time. A great performance. All his facial expressions and mannerisms were spot on.
Too bad the story was pretty blah. The ending wasn't satisfying at all, considering how predictable it was.",The Night Clerk
13,cekadah,Murder and deceit,10,23 March 2020,"The leading male, Bart, has Asperger's. But the movie isn't about this disease. Bart finds himself swept into a murder scene because he wants to learn to be more socially efficient. Then Andrea shows up! And the plot takes an unexpected path.John Leguizamo is superb as the detective, Ty Sheridan is completely believable as Bart. Helen Hunt is the protective yet enabling mother. Ana de Armas as Andrea will have you under her spell.This is a must see film for those who like to think about what they are watching and the mystery of how the story will unfold.",The Night Clerk

A garbage found FOOTAGE piece of crap gets 5s all day long and this oscar performance by an actor gets a 5?? I have to apologize to the cast and crew of this magical film for the EXTREMELY UNDERRATED score here. Beautiful performances by the whole cast but a phenomenal performance by mr Sheridan!!

Working as a night clerk at a hotel he observes people to sharpen his social skills. This extends to placing secret cameras in hotel rooms to see how they act when alone or in small groups. Voyeuristic but not sexually motivated. Bart observes some being killed in a room. How is he going to explain his knowledge to the police? Moved to another hotel he starts to form a link with a young woman guest, Andrea (Ana de Armas). An interesting exploration of how someone who feels different relates to relationships, authorities and everyday society. Some Noir elements intersect with this journey of discovery.

19,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Night Clerk,6,29 February 2020,"""That's a very complicated question"". The Night Clerk (my latest review) is not that ""complicated"" of a movie. I mean not if you rewatch the ending over and over. At a running time of an hour and a half, ""Night Clerk"" probably could have concluded in say, fifteen minutes. As Sergeant Roger Murtaugh would quip, ""pretty thin, huh?""Anyway, 2020's The Night Clerk contains a capable cast including a weathered Helen Hunt, a weathered Jonathon Schaech, Spielberg and Jeremy Allen White lookalike Tye Sheridan, and the always likable John Leguizamo. The film is about a kooky hotel clerk who gets embroiled in the murder of woman who happens to be staying at said hotel.Stylistic, Hitchcockian, nocturnal, and of the noir variety, ""Night Clerk"" contains the most surveillance cameras in it this side of 1993's Sliver. Heck, after seeing this flick you might think twice about checking in to the nearest Red Roof Inn (ha).Directed by a dude known for winning a Pulitzer Prize (Michael Cristofer), containing quick cut flashbacks, and distributed by Saban Films, The Night Clerk comes off as a voyeuristic persona study for its game lead in Tye Sheridan (he plays a lodge front desk guy named Bart Bromley).Sheridan's performance is a tad annoying (and frustrating) but he plays the part with total, nuanced discipline. He digs pretty deep and his shtick projects as the type of role Robin Williams would have took on right after appearing in One Hour Photo (you gotta love those weirdo techy people).All in all, The Night Clerk is slow in spots and at first, feels too tangled for its own good. Take another look at it (like I did) and you might not have to revert back to its quote from the first paragraph of my review (""that's a very complicated question""). Rating: 2 and a half stars.",The Night Clerk
20,Foutainoflife,Solid Acting,6,16 October 2020,Tye Sheridan was awesome in this. Very talented young man.The story was interesting and the acting was solid. The big bummer here is a lack in detail and depth. Everything is very in the moment and portrayed as what you see is about all you're going to get. It is the biggest flaw in my opinion.Not bad just not enough depth. Good watch.,The Night Clerk
21,bjarias,... how many do you start watching then pretty quickly toss-aside,7,14 September 2021,... better than review average... yes.. writing-story's just-passable... casting makes this film... not ever gonna be one u'll probably be watching again... yet once was ok.,The Night Clerk
22,Vivekmaru45,A very poorly contrusted and directed thriller by a director with no vision or experience at all.,1,26 February 2020,"By writing this review, I am probably saving 1hr. 30mins. of your life(more or less...). I didn't understand the movie at all. What I could make out was this motel receptionist Bart Bromley(Tye Sheridan) with a sort of disability who is also a voyeur secretly, one day sees a woman getting murdered and immediately goes to the scene of the crime and reports it.The Police detective Johnny Espada(played by veteran actor John Leguizamo) interviews Bromely and somehow suspects that all is what it seems... Helen Hunt another veteran actress who plays Bromley's mother, is also brought into the investigation.This is all I could understand. But the movie itself is so frustrating difficult to sit through that I gave up and just watched blindly. Years ago I had seen a similar thriller movie which was very watchable and with a good cast called Sliver(1993).Offhand I can recommend some thrillers better than this trash: When the Bough Breaks(1994), The Nature of the Beast(1995), Copycat (1995), Bone Daddy (1998), The Bone Collector (1999).Watch the above movies and you will not regret it.",The Night Clerk
23,Sir_AmirSyarif,Embarrassing for everyone involved,4,7 June 2020,"Tye Sheridan delivers a powerfully understated turn but 'The Night Clerk' is ineffective, bland, and at times puzzling in its directing and cinematography choices. Embarrassing for everyone involved.",The Night Clerk
24,lopezpatricia-06139,What happened to Helen hunts face,7,22 August 2020,Tye gave a good performance as a young man with Aspergers. But be warned it isn't a tense fast paced crime drama. In fact the crime was incidental to the story as it's really about a young man experiencing love for the first time. Quite beautiful. Also I had to pause to check the cast as I couldn't believe that was Helen Hunt. Maybe the makeup artist wasn't very good. The synopsis leads to believe that this film is a hybrid of Sliver meets No Vacancy's. But isn't.,The Night Clerk
25,SoumikBanerjee25,Misleading Trailers! An awful marketing gimmick.,3,24 November 2020,"""The Night Clerk"" had a critical identity crisis. It never settled on how it should be perceived! A Thriller? A Drama? or a Typical Romance? In the end they mixed it all up & turned it into an ostentatious mess!For an alleged thriller, it fails to forge enough tension, suspense or thrill! Barring a great set of performances, the film lost its selfdom everywhere else. Screenplay is disjointed, storyline doesn't come to a resolution nor it had anything meaningful to convey!Deceitful promotions are wrongfully done for the film, which exhibited this as a Murder Mystery/Thriller; it was all a set up to mislead. Which is such an awful thing to do. I wonder, what the makers have had in their minds? The actual presentation is way different than what the trailers have projected it to be. I'm honestly disappointed in these false advertisements even more than the film's poorer outcome.To sum it up, somewhere It must've had lurking potential but an addled writing coupled with clueless direction made sure everything goes sideways.",The Night Clerk
26,bshaef,This Movie Pretty Much Sucked,4,11 June 2020,The director tried to be so cool but he lost the thread somewhere in the last half of the movie and went off to never never land. No human would agree to participate in such a plan and then weep about it. Plus that the ending was terrible;. The mother was cigar store Indian stiff and the detective was pretty much non existent throughout the movie. Any respectable detective would have pretty much solved the case ten minutes in the movie and his living and dining arrangements with his ma were laughable.,The Night Clerk

28,Stanlee107,He is watching you...,6,15 May 2020,"This is a film is charter driven so I wouldn't recommend that anyone that wants action to avoid this. This film centres around a night clerk that has a higher fuctioning form of autism (asphager's). He witnesses a murder but unable to process his feelings or act in a manner that one expects.He develops a fascination with one of the female guest. There are hints of voyeurism but with a mixed of unintentional comedic moments as he struggle to follow the considered ""social norm"".The ending is unexpected.. the film itself is a compelling watch.

29,johannes2000-1,A pleasant surprise.,8,1 October 2020,"This movie, that I never had heard of before, turned out as something of a pleasant surprise. The premise is reasonably original (Asperger guy is witness of a murder in the hotel where he works, and brings himself in danger due to his awkward reaction and behavior) and the simple but intelligent story kept me interested as to where it would lead. It's evidently a low budget film, so don't expect spectacular special effects, there's hardly graphic violence and the pace is rather slow, but within these limitations they did a really fine job.Apart for the thriller aspects, there were some very tender scenes too, like the ones between main character Bart and his crush Andrea, especially their scene by the pool. But also the scenes with Bart's mother (Helen Hunt in a very strong and sensitive role) were great, I loved how the mother let her autistic son go his own unusual way without questioning or judging it, but all the time simply being there as a loving and caring safety-net, and standing up for him when things got rough. To me the biggest surprise was Tye Sheridan, he is not only endearing as the vulnerable and confused autistic Bart, but he also acts all Bart's awkward mannerisms and idiosyncrasies in a very convincing and touching way, which seemed to me a considerable tour de force.",The Night Clerk
30,danielmanson,Acting was fantastic. Not much else beyond that,6,10 August 2020,"Okay, I had no expectations going into this film at all. Didn't search it or anything. The idea interested me and I went for it. And I've come out of it with mixed feelings.Issues. - So I thought that this film was a ""crime thriller"" and it didn't really seem all that. A large portion of the film is romance. The thriller aspect is based around whether he can prove he's innocent or not. But, if you watch you'd know the evidence is all there. So the thriller aspect is actually very minor.
It felt very monotonous. A large portion of the film is almost pointless to the cause, long conversations that aren't needed etc. It felt like a short film extended just to make it film length.there's so many different avenues and ideas that could have been implemented to this plot. It's a fantastic idea for a film, just not executed amazingly.Typically, I'd give this a 5/10. Watchable but forgettable. But the acting performances from the main 2 were fantastic and I felt I had to upgrade to a 6 purely on that.
But yeah. Maybe worth watching on a week night to chill, film is very linear so not much thinking needed either.",The Night Clerk

Okay then...The mystery of 'The Night Clerk' is the fact that it has an impressive cast - from Helen Hunt and John Leguizamo to Ana de Armas and Tye Sheridan. Yet everything about the film is a complete letdown, from the screenwriting and dialogue to the acting itself. It feels as if the story was conceptualized by a teenager and then handed to an inexperienced director to bring to life, except Michael Cristofer is not inexperienced (having directed such films as 'Original Sin' and 'Gia' back in the day).There are just too many bad lines, awkward pauses, unnecessarily drawn out scenes and an unsatisfying ending. 'Clerk' is not an exciting film, it doesn't give viewers any real reason to feel a sense of suspense and it feels like it was thrown together in three days. It's actually shocking. Worst of all, the focus on Bart's Asperger's is supposed to be uplifting, but if anything, many stereotypes about the disability are unintentionally reinforced.Don't check in to this hotel.",The Night Clerk

38,SnobReviews,Flawed but overall entertaining with good performances.,6,10 June 2020,"Oddly enough I enjoyed ""The Night Clerk"" much more than I thought I would. I use the term ""oddly enough"" only because it could've been a complete train-wreck but this film is overall entertaining.
.
In this thriller, a voyeuristic hotel clerk with Aspergers becomes the subject of a murder investigation.
.
The real fuel in ""The Night Clerk"" is the lead performance from Tye Sheridan. The young actor delivers a hypnotic and solid performance that you don't see coming. Sheridan makes you sympathize with the character all the while questioning his morals. Ana De Armas is terrific as usual and the legendary John Leguizamo is great; I love seeing him in more serious roles. The film as a whole is flawed, but at a quick 90-minutes, the film seems to fly by and you can't help but be intertwined with what is happening on screen. It's a decent enough thriller that is good for a weekday watch.

39,AJ_McAninch,Being the Smartest One in the Room,8,20 June 2020,"Wonderful cast and director with our two main leads spot on, especially in a couple of nuanced scenes (and that bell in the background...which changes tone) that are achingly beautiful, until recalled on hindsight. Then they combine with the deep double irony of bad guys thinking they can dupe the guy with Aspergers who studies people and learns from them. If you get confused by the ending, remember the most important thing about Bart: he's smarter than they are and knows exactly what he's doing, and he will have a new venue filled with people to learn from. Indeed, Bart: ""What did you do. What did you do."" Bingo.",The Night Clerk
40,faer_kr,Avoidable,1,14 March 2021,"It calls itself a crime drama and a crime drama has nothing, in fact it looks more like a romantic drama.
It is about a boy with Asperger who works in a hotel and while watching on security cameras he sees a murder in which he is involved.
Quality.
Parsimonious in the extreme.
It focuses more on the leading character in a romantic way and that you know his spectrum to crime as such.
Tye Sheridan works very well although at times he falls into the exaggeration.
He shows a bit about the reality of people who are asperger, outside of that he has nothing to contribute.
Avoidable if you are looking for a crime or thriller.
The ending is cut off abruptly and you have to interpret it.",The Night Clerk

This film was a complete waste of my time. It was flaccid....like an unsatisfying lover. It kept the same slow pace all the way through and never ever picked up. Zero climax.

42,SamJamie,6/10,6,7 January 2021,"A hotel clerk becomes the prime suspect when a woman is murdered during his shift. As the police investigation closes in, he makes a personal connection with a guest -- but soon realizes he must stop the killer before she becomes the next victim.The Night Clerk is quite a refreshing film experience. Full of intrigue and very engrossing, the film seems to do the very most with the bare essentials. Putting just enough creep and suspicion into this predicament to stir plenty of conjecture worth hanging around to figure out.
The film brings on the thrills interesting ways, by being surprisingly low-key and quiet, taking advantage of the late hours of the dark during which much of the story takes place. The film has two emotionally touching performances from Sheridan and Armas. Sheridan's deft portrayal of someone ""on the spectrum"" takes us into an interior world previously unknown to us and by the end of the film, we have emotionally connected with him.In retrospect, the film is a well-acted noir drama that pays more attention to characters than the plot, for better or worse. Besides a few pacing and writing issues, It's a film that presents itself as one that has a predictable plot but surprises viewers as the film concludes. Thrillers rarely allow for as much in-depth character work as this indie film.",The Night Clerk
43,mcjensen-05924,Dim Witted Meandering Mess,4,26 October 2020,"Oh my where to begin. An interesting premise that ultimately leads to somewhere between nowhere and frustration. It was a struggle to get halfway through this one. At this point I was so annoyed with the idiotic dialogue and pointless conversations that I no longer cared about the central mystery surrounding the movie. I just wanted to run away. None of the main characters were the least bit believable in their role. Stilted wooden deliveries of inane dialogue really tests the endurance of the most dedicated viewer. I always have a problem when a parent bursts onto the scene and starts dictating to the police what they can and can't do during the course of their investigatin. I'm surprised I made it halfway. Yes, Ana is a lovely actress and it's on her looks alone I made it as deep into this snooze fest that I did.",The Night Clerk
44,itsbobr,Very Good Thriller,9,8 April 2020,"Bart (Tye Sheridan) is a night clerk at a motel. He suffers from Asperger's (a sort of Autistic disorder) He knows he is socially awkward. He records guests in the rooms to find out how to interact with people. He records the murder of Karen Perretti (Jacque Gray), but doesn't tell the police. Of course, the police suspect him, but can't prove anything. Enter Andrea Rivera (Ana de Armas) an extremely beautiful woman who had a brother with Asperger's and she is quite familiar with Bart and his ways.Yes, this is slow-going, but when Ana de Armas is on the screen we don't care as we could look at her all day. And, of course, Bart falls for Andrea and will do anything to protect her. And it appears that the same man who killed Karen is the same man with Andrea. This is important because you will have questions when this ends.I would nominate Tye Sheridan for Best Actor because he did an exceptional job, much like Dustin Hoffman did in Rain Man. Okay, also I would nominate Ana De Armas for Best Actress because she is a very good actress and she nailed this job. The chemistry between Tye Sheridan and Ana de Armas is exceptional. The banter between their characters is pure gold.Notables: Helen Hunt as Ethel, Bart's protective mother; John Leguizamo, the police detective, who watches Bart as he believes Bart is hiding something; Johnathon Schaech as Nick Perrette, Karen's husband who wants Bart arrested.The ending may seem confusing to many, but I only see it one way.

45,danybur,Spy to learn,6,19 March 2021,"AbstractThe Night Clerk is a film about a young hotel concierge with Asperger's syndrome who becomes a witness and then a suspect in a crime. The movie works better as a drama than a thriller, building on some accomplished intimate moments.
Review:Bart, a young man with Asperger syndrome (Tye Sheridan), works as a night shift concierge at a small hotel. He has surreptitiously set up a camera system inside the rooms to spy and record the guests in order to improve his particular ways of relating and talking to people. But in this way he becomes a witness (and later a suspect) of a crime that he observes through the cameras.Michael Cristofer's film (which refers to spy movies like Rear Window, Body Double, and Sliver) is a combination of drama and thriller that works best as drama. Bart's character is well outlined, with his curious (and typical) combination of naivety, intelligence, and communication difficulties, with his consequent loneliness. The film takes its time to create effective intimate climates between the protagonist and a new guest, Andrea (femme fatal from the story by the versatile Ana de Armas) and to delineate with few and effective strokes the relationship between Bart and his mother (a unrecognizable and intense Helen Hunt).As for the thriller side, the story opens its letters, but certain elements of the intrigue and its resolution are somewhat confused and perhaps forced.",The Night Clerk

John Leguizamo also puts on a perfect character. I liked his cops balanced attitude.",The Night Clerk
47,quaseprovisorio,the problem here is on how the story is told,4,27 April 2020,"Well i have a few friends with asperger. they don't work exactly like tye sheridan in fhe film, even though not being able to handle ""normal"" conversations (one of them got a lot better in time with is) and saying things very much out of the context are part of it. still, not as exagerated as in the film. but the movie can create empathy with the protagonist. ana de armas seems to be a good actress and helen hunt still acts well even though she doesn't have much of a role in this film.finally someone remembers leguizamo is actually an excellent actor that should be in better hands. tarantino above all should remember him one of these days, i'm positive he will deliver. he steals every scene he's in, and he truly deserves more opportunities. the movie is also not very boring, even though it should have better rythm.the probem is how this story is told. mixing the ""romance"" part with the crime was not a very bright idea. there was no suspense, nothing to makes us guessing. this could have been a great crime movie if they were able to write the script in a different way. the dialogues often in general weren't that good,. but the main problem is really the story being lost in between two different types of film and can't solve itself. to be a drama didn't have enough material to work with. to be a crime story it needed more police investigation. more leguizamo and less sheridan? maybe that would fix it, even though sheridan did a good job.it's not exactly awful, and thankfully i wasn't expecting much but it's also not very good.",The Night Clerk
48,BillBayard,A terrific Tye Sheridan,6,21 May 2021,"Interesting, though very flawed, little film about a young man with Asperger's working the night shift at a hotel chain and his involvement with something he sees that he shouldn't have. It's also a touching, though odd, little love story. The movie rests on the shoulders of Tye Sheridan who is terrific in the lead role. I remember being impressed by him years ago in Mud and not very impressed by him or anything else in Ready Player One, one of Spielberg's worst movies, but he is a very talented young man in the right role. He's one of the producers on this, so he obviously knows what he's capable of. Ana De Armas, who I recently saw in Knives Out and who made no particular impression on me other than competency, is quite good here. The flaws are some logic in the tale told here, a curiously uninteresting performance by the talented Helen Hunt and an ending that doesn't really tell us how it all ended. I do recommend it though as it is a bit different and for Sheridan's strong and difficult to pull off performance.",The Night Clerk

That combined with his mental affliction --- no charges. But no emotional payoff for the viewers.I would also agree it had a little bit of a pacing problem. It was seemingly slow at times. But it wasn't an action thriller. So, that is to be expected. Or at least tolerated.I know people with Asperger's. Tye Sheridan's depiction was dead on. But be advised, everybody with Asperger's has it at different levels of seriousness. Some have it worse than Bart. Many have it at a much less severe degree.

77,vandeman-scott,Stereotype after stereotype after cliché after stereotype,3,13 June 2020,"With ""The Night Clerk,"" the filmmakers had all the raw materials they needed to create an innovative thriller: a reasonable budget, name actors, and an interesting premise. Somehow, they missed every opportunity to capitalize.The plot centers on Bart Bromley, a voyeuristic desk clerk with Asperger's Syndrome. Bromley, played by Tye Sheridan (who also produces the film), becomes the hapless focus of a murder investigation. While Sheridan attempts an ambitious portrayal of a young man on the spectrum, ""The Night Clerk"" seems like little more than an excuse for him to play a character role, one that could have been challenging with a better written script and a bit more vision.Bromley, rather than serving merely as a caricature, could have been the dramatic linchpin to a truly good film. Unfortunately, ""Clerk"" fails to respect those with autism, exploiting every available stereotype to portray the protagonist as a stooge and a patsy. How interesting.A tired Ana de Armas plays misguided, sex pot mistress Andrea. Presented initially as sympathetic, her character soon reverts to type, revealing herself near the film's end to be a wanton, home-wrecking mean girl who's content to allow an ""Aspie"" to suffer a tragic miscarriage of justice in furtherance of her own selfish desires. What a surprise.Quality actors Helen Hunt and John Leguizamo are clearly disengaged. That's understandable, given the script provides them little with which to work.Had Hunt been afforded the opportunity to develop her character beyond the typical overprotective mommy into one who experiences genuine internal conflict, her character could have had substance.Leguizamo's Detective Espada is so devoid of intellectual curiosity that he reads as nothing more than an old cliché: a lazy, undiscerning cop in need of spoon feeding. No wonder Leguizamo seems bored.Overall, ""The Night Clerk"" fails because it plays straight to stereotypes while offering nothing inventive or unexpected.

82,michaeljpfitzgerald,"Thumbs up, for sure, but with serious concerns",3,26 June 2020,"It's so hard to figure a film like this. Inside the constraints and the limited understanding I have of what Autism is, what movies tend to suggest Autism is, Tye Sheridan is thunderingly good, here. This is a quiet movie, with a soft pace, and surprisingly little meat on its bones - there is the suggestion of a mystery thriller, but its more open than that. It manages to feel, again mostly bc of Sheridan, quite complex, while actually running very lean and with good momentum.The problem, then, is that I have no idea if this film is as unfair and exploitative as worry that it is. All the supporting cast is tremendous - it's heartening, always, to see Hunt and Leguizamo. Both are superior actors, and both show up for his piece. Ana de Armas is everything - despite the handful of big movies under her belt, I don't understand her relative obscurity. She dominates the camera.But there is no movie without Sheridan, and there is no plot, no part, without this worrying depiction of a young Autistic man who is also a chronic, criminal voyeur. I am left wondering if there wasn't a version of this movie where a young Autistic man meets a young woman whose sibling was Autistic, and in the understanding that is forged there, find a brief, beautiful relationship. The need to intertwine Autism, and indeed any neurological, developmental condition, with criminality to make the character 'worthy' of inclusion in a film feels like a deeply regressive problem - an indictment on audiences AND the industry.Because while Sheridan's performance is compelling, his proclivities in the film are villifying, and I have real concerns about how this film paints the condition - Aspergers specifically, Autism generally. And if the film is built, as I feel it is, a feeling somewhat reinforced by a few comments by Hunt's Ethel, entirely on a foundation of the idea that it is Bart's Aspergers that fuels his voyeurism, I think that foundation is not stable. I think the movie fails, because it is built on a lie.There's so, SO much I like about this. The failure of framing, the insistence on intertwining Autism with voyeurism, makes me want to give it a single star - the performances, the film-making, the drive would merit a 5 from me, normally. {A very good rating} So I've settled on a 3, because of all the good work. I'm just sad at some of the choices, and that there's still room for this sort of framing and exploitation in our media.",The Night Clerk

Plus, you know you need a job to earn money and you get into what you can!)Anyway, back to the film... people are saying the tye Sheridan nailed aspergers, but in my opinion, he didnt. Hes acting like an intelligent idiot, and that's not someone with aspergers... just because people feel we dont interact well, doesnt mean we spout nonsense all the time. Or hide in basements watching people on camera. Very bizarre. And offensive to those with autism. Why couldn't they cast someone who was autistic? Or at least get assistance from autistic people.Just watched the scene where he meets the girl in the supermarket, and she says ""my brother had it"" as if it's an illness, so offensive.

89,incubus-0914,"Maybe good acting, but I was bored tbh",3,31 January 2021,"Hmmm... I always thought the people with Asperger's shows much more subtle behavioural patterns than the one depicted in this film. To my knowledge, they act like anyone, but you occasionally wonder if they fully understand what you mean or if you're having a mutual understanding on the topic while having conversations with them. That sort of thing.Anyways, I understand why some people say this movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, thriller? Drama? Or Romance?Thriller and horror are my favourite genre and frankly I was pretty bored throughout.As a thriller, it's half baked. You can guess who killed the lady early on and you'll find out that you're correct midway through . There's no twist either. No guess work involved in the identity of the killer or a catharsis of finding who the killer is with this movie.Drama/Romance wise, the script doesn't describe the characters deep enough. I need to see more character developments, and get familiar with their perspectives and motives and where they're coming from. I can see the female protagonist is a lonely troubled woman, but I couldn't know her well enough to comprehend the reasonings of her actions, and also unfortunately, you cannot expect viewers to agree with everything happening in this story just because the main character has a spectrum; I mean some parts appear to be a little too convenient for the sake of the story to go on.The ending is somewhat confusing. There is a flashback of previous scenes which makes it look like the main character is perhaps the culprit, but we already know who the killer is by then so what's the point of that?Although I can only speculate on what state of mind he is in while wandering in a mall, it also felt weird to close the movie that way especially after the 'misleading' gunshot.Lastly, I wanted more screen time of John Leguizamo and Helen Hunt. I can't deny that it feels a bit of a waste to see those two seasoned actors playing rather small roles.All in all, if you are a huge thriller fan, you may not be satisfied. If you're interested in to know what Asperger's is, you may or may not find some insights here. If you are a fan of Ana de Armas, possibly worth watching since she steals every scene while she's in the frame. She's just adorable.",The Night Clerk

For some reason this just struck me as a made-for-TV-movie; perhaps it was direction or scenery or plot or dialogue. I had great difficulty with the main character, and whether that portrayal of Asperger's was accurate; somehow it seemed off to me. Others here have said that it's accurate, and others inaccurate. The use of the hidden cameras is a bit odd. They make it seem that he is just doing this to mimic people, with no ill-intent, but obviously he would see all sorts of private things going on there (in the hotel rooms), and it's not as if there is no other source for dialogue if he just wants to practice speaking. Are we to believe that the Asperger's rendered him incapable of seeing how wrong this was? He seems to understand that he would get in big trouble if they found out about his cameras (hence his immediate removal of them following the incident), and he also seems to have some concern for the two females he perceives to be at risk in the rooms. What's up with his inability to see the impropriety of spying on hotel guests? But the movie is OK.",The Night Clerk

Rarely is one actor's performance a big deal for me- actor's are tools that a director uses. Sometimes there are performances that outshine every other aspect of the film, and this is one of those performances.
I've worked for over 6 years with special needs individuals, one in particular is diagnosed with Asperger's. Tye Sheridan's performance is so dead on that I know he a) researched real people with Asperger's extensively, and b) has the skills and confidence to incorporate that into his work here.

I'm not saying enjoying a film or not isn't subjective, but let's face it, when you literally say the only good things about this movie are ""Tye Sheridan's acting and Ana de Armas' breasts"", you basically know everything about that person's opinion you need to know. First of all, yes, Sheridan does a great job here, but de Armas is equally great. To say the only thing she offers this film is her boobs is grossly insulting and signifies someone with no real interest in the film.I thought this was a pretty interesting film. Superficially, of course, it's easy to say it's about Aspberger's, and while that is an obvious part of the plot, I don't think it's fair to say that this is what the film is ""about."" It's like if the protagonist was a news reporter, would we say the film is about journalism? Anyway, I don't want to say too much, in the interest of not spoiling anything, but it's a cool study in how different people make connections in the world and the vulnerability that comes with those connections.

I was worried that it was going to be a one-dimensional portrayal, like, say, Freddie Highmore's Dr. Shaun Murphy in The Good Doctor. Perhaps we're just looking at different degrees on the spectrum...
but when Bart ""accidentally"" opens up and slips into the ""everyday world,"" instead of his own, and sees how easy it can be, it was a beautiful moment, terrifically encouraging, and a real point of relief in the plot.Other reviewers felt he was yet another ""annoying character,"" designed to bring us somewhere, through the character's denouement, in an altogether obvious way.

Im not sure what shes done with her looks but knowing what she looks like from all of her past movies to this movie is jarring. While she may not be a favorite of mine shes played some great parts my favorite being in As Good As it Gets. Her face is emotionless, stiff & shes unrecognizable in many shots. Theres a scene where shes trying to be uplifting to her son but it comes across flat & scripted because there's nothing on her face no emotion. I truly think she hurts the film but im sure her name was a big get & initially helped.

If you as many people expect this as the main focus of this movie, again, prepare to be disappointed. It is about how the MC want to prove that he's innocent without the help of police, how he trapped all who's involved or related to the murder that want to set him up but actually he know's all along and how he set them up again.All in all, it's not really that bad.",The Night Clerk

Several dialogues seem forced in there, and don't really line up with the rest of the movie. I wasn't emotionally invested in Bart's budding friendship/romantic relationship with Andrea, nor was I experiencing any sort of suspense at the idea that a murder's been committed at the hotel and that Bart's the main suspect.Figuring out who the real murderer was took minimal effort as well, and the ending was just bizarre. I can enjoy movies that end with question marks, but this? This was just weird.",The Night Clerk
149,ianscottlewis,A Wonderful Surprise,8,24 October 2020,I knew nothing about this movie before watching and therefore had no expectations. I was really blown away. It's a slow burn thriller - in spite of its short run time - with compelling performances by both lead actors and it pulls off the achievement or being both bleak and uplifting with equal aplomb.,The Night Clerk
150,irishviking21,"It's not about the puzzle, it's about the piece",8,3 July 2020,"Not a perfect film, but it shouldn't be viewed as just that. It's a wonderfully heartbreaking portrayal of a young man living with what has now been discounted as a condition, and is now merely a part of ASD. This film illustrates the vast difference between lumping everyone into that category (non-verbal, non-functional, semi-verbal, etc), and someone with Aspergers. Sheridan does a great job of showing that this is not the same, and we can see the functionality of this while also seeing the struggle to integrate into societal norms despite not understanding the WHY of needing to do so. I've worked with many kids that fall into the spectrum (Aspergers) portrayed by Sheridan, and it's amazing at how they chose to portray it on screen. The single mother who knows and respects his personal space is so paramount, yet so real. Don't watch this movie unless you have an background in ABA or want to see how hard it is for someone with no innate drive to integrate into a society that they can't relate to.",The Night Clerk
151,evison_mark,"Great, Under-Valued Film",9,15 June 2020,"Very glad I watched this despite the overwheilmingly low score on here and elsewhere (there was little else to see, in a just post-covid 19 Saigon).
The lead's acting is fantastic. While not building a character you can take totally to heart, there was definitely some development of depth, and also signs of progress for the young man, helping give viewers hope in helping with (or suffering from) Aspergers. It left left us talking about a few instances in the movie, and its connotations after the movie and the next morning - something very movies, particularly coming out of the Holywood hills, manage to do.
It's not The Joker, but it's definitely worth seeing: A unique, very well-acted and slightly twisty just-enough-of-a-thriller. Thanks for being different, writers and producers!",The Night Clerk

Tye Sheridan is pure amgic, skillfully portraying a mesmerizing combination of innocence and masculinity. The chemistry between him and the girl is electrifying, which is so rarely achieved in cinema.

Its, pace is like the classic noir films of the 60's, it draws you in and has sweet, emotions for the main characters. This film is a salute to those films. It also reminds one if David Lynch's early films. Combining, strange, broken characters who's lives are lonely and odd.

159,mckennapaul,Difficult yet very compelling!,7,6 August 2020,"Tye Sharidan did a great job of playing someone with ASD! The film steered away from all the usual short sighted clichés depicted in the media and its clear the actor and director did their research. All the small awkward movements likes he's super aware of every body part. With the way he stops and starts the conversation. And Bart had me laughing with his regular quirks. Hats off, well done!The story really rings true to how people with Autism are taken advantage of, and suspected as the culprit because they act differently.
It's difficult to watch in many parts of the film but that's because of the severely awkward social behaviour of Bart. Which I think is what the director wanted to convey, and that will probably put many people off which is a shame. The crippling loneliness of Bart comes through in the film even if the character doesn't obviously express it. The scene when he came up to share dinner with his mum was well communicated it was a huge step for both of them. And it shows throughout the film how difficult the relationship is between Bart and his mum.
The situation Bart finds himself in is a little dramatic to compare to real life but it made for and entertaining story.
Nicely done with respect to the ASD condition. Cudos!",The Night Clerk

162,onelifetotoy,Cancel my reservation please!,2,11 June 2020,"2 stars for the lead actor only, otherwise this movie is as dull as hotel room coffee. The start of the movie was actually rather intriguing and I started to envision what great direction it could go in. It was creepy, and invasive, and it reminded me of the movie ""Vacancy"".Any promise quickly swirls down the drain though. The movie lacks direction, has some terrible acting, lacks realism, and contains scenes that drag on and on and suck the life out of the viewer. This is no thriller, and I'd hardly even call it a crime drama. It may start off that way, but it quickly shifts into a Lifetime original romance made for TV nonsense.I hate movies like this where the main characters seemingly run into each other everywhere, and appear to be the only few people in existence in the world. For example the socially awkward clerk happens to run into the gorgeous female guest at some random grocery store and then engage in a 10 minute intimate conversation. Then later the two encounter each other again at the hotel and it appears that no one else is alive. No other guests, an abandoned looking properly. So much so that the two go to the outdoor swimming pool and literally have a 20 minute sappy conversation. Yes, that's a scene! It drags on and on and on and nothing happens.Then when you are ready for something exciting to happen, you either get Helen Hunt making dinner and trying to console her son, or John Leguizamo raising his voice a little bit.With that, I check out. Do not disturb please.",The Night Clerk
163,darncrow,A character study with solid acting,7,17 July 2020,"Make no mistake, The Night Clerk is not a groundbreaking film. There aren't loud explosions or jump scares or gory violence people overusing profanity to try and force the characters on you. In other words, you can put this on for just about anybody and they won't be screaming for you to turn it off. Of course, if you need all those things to be entertained you will be extremely bored watching this. The film centers around our main character and the entire plot builds around him. I won't go into any details because you can read the synopsis. I though the 2 lead actors did a great job. There were some issues with pacing in the mid to second half of the movie and pretty much all the other actors were either passable (detective) or useless (mother, husband, shift change guy). All in all though the ending was satisfying for what you started. Again, this will not win many awards. But it's a decent family friendly or date night movie that kept my wife and I entertained.",The Night Clerk

Tye Sheridan gives a spot on performance as Bart, a young man on the autism spectrum who secretly films guests at the hotel where he works the night shift. When he witnesses a woman murdered in one of the rooms he films, he becomes a suspect. The story is not at all boring but rather it is suspenseful in the way it follows Bart's attempts to deal with his emotional response to the murder. Great performances all around by Helen Hunt as Bart's mother trying to let her son have a life if his own and John Leguizamo as the detective who suspects him of the murder. Ana de Armas as Andrea, surprises in her role as the pretty girl who befriends Bart. This movie has a slow burn but it's worth every second of it",The Night Clerk

It's surely not a crime movie, it's neither a drama. To be honest, I cannot label this film with a specific genre. And maybe that is its biggest flaw: identity crisis. If you expect a crime movie and you don't get one, you'll be certainly disappointed.
However, the acting is surprisingly good (apart from the guy playing the victim's husband). And there is some food for thought throughout the movie. It's easy to watch and the ending is not a total cliché.

But let this exactly be how persons with autism feel and interact with the world around them. The extreme ticks and way of walking wasn't necessary, but it gives an on edge feeling that was needed for this movie.

218,DickScrapshaw,Moving and powerful,9,17 August 2020,"I have never written a film review before but I felt I must write one for this amazing piece of work because I could not believe some other reviewers were giving scores like 2 out of 10. The acting and direction is incredible with a perfect ramp up to give time to learn about the lead character's back story. From there a compelling story unfolds and I'll leave you to watch and enjoy for yourself. Anyone who watches this and gives it a poor score is clearly watching the wrong film for them. May I suggest something less emotionally challenging, for instance, anything starring Dwayne Johnson.",The Night Clerk
